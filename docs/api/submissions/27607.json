You based all your expectations on what you would do for her if the situation was reversed rather than the reality of your relationship. \n\nShe clearly wasn\u2019t on the same page as you. She wasn\u2019t upfront and honest and even would tell you she\u2019d come over and then last minute change her mind.

When you\u2019re looking for a partner your doing it generally with a plan for life, at any point in your life you could develop an illness or have an accident that requires some kind of help wether short or long term.

He has random arthritic flare-ups and can't move. I'm his PARTNER! It's my job to be there when he needs me. I've been on bed rest this pregnancy, and he is ALWAYS there for me. So no, you are NTA.

The very basics of a relationship is that you care about the other person on some level. To me being in a romantic partnership for years would mean I care a little bit more about you than I would your average person. She let you know that she doesn\u2019t care enough to even to put up with mild discomfort and inconvenience for you. Some people would help out a complete stranger in the same situation but she couldn\u2019t for a partner, that\u2019s just messed up.

And in asking, you needed to be aware of her other obligations - of course it will be too much to work a full day at work, then come back to do all of your daily care.  \n\nAsking is fine, but you were expecting, without consideration of the impact it would have on her.  And I sense some guilt tripping going on - you asked her for help, but if she couldn't do it, you had no back up plan, either for the care or for social connection so you wouldn't be lonely.

He says he was laid up, was she having to deal with urinals and bedpans, as well? Changing his clothes, the sheets on his bed? (Sheets need daily changing for someone who is bedbound.) Repositioning to avoid pressure sores? He's got a cat, which she doesn't like, is she stuck cleaning the litter box?\n\nWhat's said, and left unsaid, would be a full shift's work for a personal care aide.  Which he needs, 7 days a week.  And which is too much to expect from one person who is also working a full time job.\n\nHe was asking every day, even when she was saying \"no.\"\n\nShe's made it clear she prefers living separately, and doesn't like staying at his place. They aren't living together, engaged or married. She's not his mother.  They have a friendly dating relationship. That's okay.  But it isn't a situation where you can assume someone will be your only post-surgical caregiver.\n\nMostly, he says, he asked, she said no.  Occasionally she'd say she'd stop by after work, but I suspect he was taking her \"I'll see if I can manage to swing by\" as a promise she'd be there and do all he needed.\n\nShe would have to finish work, go home change clothes, eat something, drive to his place, do whatever he needed, then head home again. Staying at his place during the week isn't practical, it is too far from her work.\n\nWhat was his actual care plan, made in advance of surgery, discussed with all caregivers, and with each agreeing freely to provide specific help?\n\n\"My girlfriend will take care of it\" is not a care plan, unless all details are discussed and agreed to in advance of the surgery, and contingency plans are in place.", "Was she bullied into saying she would come? That's my question, because it seems like he wouldn't let up until she said she'd visit.

Cats did not come from space.", "You make very good points and as of now I can look back and think the same thing, I did all the running and leg work so why all of a sudden did I expect different?\nHonest answer is I judge people by my actions, if someone I loved (hell even just fond off) needed me I would go through hell and high water to do what I could.\nIt didn't even occur to me that she wouldn't be there, laughable I know but at the time I was in pain I was scared and just thought she would be my rock.\nThe dude talking about how I shouldn't have expected anything will love that statement and accuse me of expecting etc.\nBut I would do it for her so I assumed she would do it for me.\nIsn't that a relationship though?\nWhen you break it down and remove sex and cosy nights in and exciting nights out, isn't a relationship the concept of having that one person you can trust and rely on?\nI mean marriage vows include \"in sickness and in health\" so is that to say that you marry someone and because you didn't plan to wake up with a cold one day then the vows are now N/A?\n\nBut jokes on me for expecting 50 percent from someone who expected 100 percent of me while only returning 20 percent", "So you haven't done more than he asks for \"mere acquaintances\".", "He keeps calling to pit the respo si ility for his care on her and is upset when she says no.

Or having an alternate source of help if she can't?\n\nIf he needs her to provide daily help, that absolutely must be discussed in advance, backup plans made, and if she can't help daily, this needs to be discussed when making the discharge plan from the hospital, and a source of care set up.\n\nAsking is one thing. Okay, as long as you can deal with a \"no\" without giving a hard time.  Expecting is a different story, especially when it isn't that sort of relationship.

Otherwise you might find yourself in another unequal relationship with someone because you feel like you need the relationship, and your new partner likes the sex and companionship but doesn't really give a shit about you. And you deserve better than that.", ">I've done more for mere acquaintances who were laid up than your gf did for you.\n\nThis is what he actually said. That they did more than she did.

Check out the poster's details about it all. He even specifies how much he did **NOT** expect her to be an in-home carer in any way.\n\nWhen people love each other in life, they also care for their partner's well being. I don't know your life story (nor do I want to) but it's truly special to witness someone acting as if *caring for the person you love most on earth* to be something alien.\n\nHe did not expect much, he did not ask fro much, and he got no care in it all.
