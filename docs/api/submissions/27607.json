To me being in a romantic partnership for years would mean I care a little bit more about you than I would your average person.

Some people would help out a complete stranger in the same situation but she couldn\u2019t for a partner, that\u2019s just messed up.

And I sense some guilt tripping going on - you asked her for help, but if she couldn't do it, you had no back up plan, either for the care or for social connection so you wouldn't be lonely.

It is your own responsibility to find someone to care for u and just expecting someone else to do it regardless of if they are your partner or parent, it is a conversation that should be had BEFORE HAND.", "Nta. A good partner would want to help.", "She is no gf.", "You needed to have a chat before your surgery about your expectations of her, and what she was willing to provide.

If you weren't very mobile you could do sponge baths with cleansing wipes with her help for anything you can't reach.  A little shopping and a ice chest nearby would have gone a long way to make sure you were OK.  Honestly, you're better off without her but I'm surprised this didn't come up prior to surgery.", "Info: did you ask her before you had surgery if she would care for you after?", "Your cat is infinitely more loyal and worthy of your time and attention.

What happened is that when you needed your gf to give more than usual,  she didn't do so.  She was content with you doing the most to make the relationship work.  I'm sorry you finally had your hard wake up call when you really needed help, but better to know now and move on.  I hope you find someone who will be more invested in a relationship than your ex.", "NTA, definitely nta, as you can see her love is conditional, when it's her turn to take over and do the driving she won't do it, not even when you're suffering from a disability and literally unable to do so.

You can love someone and not be right for each other. I still have deep love for people I couldn't build a life with.", "NTA, but in future it might be a good idea to talk about your expectations *before* you\u2019re laid up on bed.

This is really horrible behaviour on her part. She should've moved in with you while you're recovering from major surgery.", "NTA. First off, I've had 4 back surgeries over the last 5 years. 3 discectomies and a fusion. I don't know what you had done but they all fucking sucked! You're in pain, you have to wear a brace and you can't bend, lift and twist which makes doing simple tasks very hard. I'm sorry you're going through it alone. Second, you dodged a bullet, my friend. She is obviously a selfish, shit human being. I couldn't imagine leaving someone I love alone after a surgery like that and refusing to help. Shame on her. You were not the AH for asking her to help you. That is what people who love each other do for each other. My husband was there 100 percent for all of the surgeries. I don't know how I would have gotten through those first couple weeks alone. I will say, if this is your first surgery,  hang in there. After about 2 to 3 weeks, things get a little easier, and once you hit the 6 week mark, it gets a lot easier. Be happy you made the decision to break up with someone who is that selfish.

That said, it sucks that she couldn't even muster some compassion for your situation and at least try to be there for you. \n\nYou deserve a partner who *wants* to take care of you, even when it's unexpected and possibly causes other hardships. That's how healthy relationships work. We must sacrifice once in a while for each other. Otherwise, it becomes one-sided and eventually someone will be left feeling used.\n\nAnyway, I hope you recover well and someday find a woman who actually cares.", "NTA, but she's been waving a lot of red flags at you for a long time.\n          \nSeriously, I have done more for neighbors who I haven't known nearly as well as you would expect to know someone after three years of dating.\n\n         \nI'm sorry your recovery from back surgery has been so isolating, but I think the most valuable outcome of the surgery was breaking up with her and moving on with your life.", "Shouldn't matter. Maybe she couldn't do it all, but seems like she tried her hardest to do nothing.", "OP mentions they both have issues. I wonder if there is a huge part of this story missing that explains her behaviours in a way that doesn't make her seem as bad.", "I don't think the surgery matters at this point.\n\nClearly the relationship could only exist if he visited her. Eventually the cat issue would have come to a boiling point and this is a matter of incompatibility and her not willing to put effort into the relationship. I'm sure when the right person comes along she'll find the time to make it to them. If work makes her that tired, then she doesn't have the energy to be a loving or equitable partner in this relationship and if it really was just a distance issue then the next conflict would be, \"hey let's move in together, get rid of your cat\", which then again points to incompatibility. Can't force someone to like cats. Can't force someone to move. Can't force someone to find energy if they don't have it, I really can't say if she was just being lazy or if she really has a draining job and it's not really fair to make a certain assumption on that.\n\nEdit to add: if she can expect him, busted up from back surgery to continue seeing her at her place via public transport, yet she has a double standard for herself and can't bring her presumably mostly able bodied self to see him bc she's tired from work, it's clear that the relationship is only carried by him.", "Doesn't matter. Your partner has a problem, you do your best to help. If you don't want to, then why are you with the person?", "This is the critical piece of info.

She had zero interest in Op even coming over to her place.", "I had a friend of 15 years and I thought we were real close. When my health went downhill they disappeared. What is even more annoying is that I wasn't even needy. He admitted that he was avoiding me when I was in hospital and in recovery. That really hurt, that he admitted it.", "Oh, don't get me wrong - I agree that her actions (whether solicited or not) were not those of someone invested in a healthy relationship. But I was also sensing that something about this relationship was seriously off.

Have you been ordering meals and timing delivery so that if she comes straight from work, she can eat and unwind before starting to do work helping you?  Have you arranged for a cleaning service to come and take care of those types of tasks?  Have you split the days among various caregivers, so you have help even if she can't be there?\n\nShe's not your housekeeper or your mother.  Taking care of you isn't somehow saving her from the horrors of unwinding while folding her own laundry and watching Netflix after work.\n\nYou neglected to make an appropriate plan for your care after surgery.\n\nYou neglected to discuss what your needs would be with her beforehand.\n\nYou neglected to ask what she might be able to help with.\n\nYou neglected to find anyone to help with the things she couldn't do.\n\nThat doesn't mean that the work automatically falls to her.\n\nDid you even think or make an effort, at all, to organize appropriate post-surgical care?

Any time somebody throws out something like that without telling us anything about what the insignificant argument was about, it often comes out that it's insignificant only to OP and not to the GF.

I'm a massive lover of cats, but there are so many areas where they've almost completely eliminated the native song birds. In many places, cats are apex predators that have few, if any, other animals that will hunt or kill them so they quickly take over. I live in a place where there are lots of predators (coyotes, foxes, raccoons, owls, etc.) that will kill and eat cats and they're still a huge problem. \n\nThe Hawaiian islands are a prime example of the huge havoc cats can wreak when the population is left unchecked. Many native bird species were ground nesters because they had no native predators, but the cats (and mongooses) have completely decimated the bird population and caused many to go extinct.", "> I should of accepted what she was willing to give rather than be disappointed\n\nThis feels very \"feeling sorry for yourself\" but I'm going to let it slide because you're fresh off a breakup and recovering from back surgery.

Recovery from operations can be difficult to predict or anticipate beforehand, whether from lack of experience, the risk of complications, or simply every individual's unique recovery path.
