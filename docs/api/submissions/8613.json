Yesterday it was my birthday and my GF threw me a surprise birthday party and invited all of our close friends. There was probably 20 people there and it was hosted at our apartment. So at some point she pulls me towards the dinning room table to open presents. One of the presents was something that I always wanted a gaming laptop. The specs were so insane that she probably dropped 2500+ usd on it. When I pulled her aside to our bedroom and asked her how much she spent on it she was like \"don't worry about it honey I love you and want you to be happy\" but I wasn't going for it and thought she was trying to show me up in front of all our friends. When she tried to kiss me I pushed her away and said why do you always try to flex your money on me? So we got into a HUGE shouting match in front of all our friends and I finally left. I got a text from her this morning asking if we could talk and haven't replied to her cause I don't know what I should say. It's important to note that I don't make a lot of money and grew up poor and she grew up with money and makes a lot because she's a doctor.

She wanted to bless you (likely) because of the fact that you\u2019ve had a harder life and she wanted to be extravagant FOR you. You definitely need to apologize sincerely and work on your mindset. My guess is you feel inadequate because you can\u2019t reciprocate with fancy gifts (that\u2019s always my hang up) but people who love giving/getting gifts are looking more for the thought put into a gift than the amount of money.

She literally was as unselfish and open-hearted as it is possible to be in her celebration of you. \n\nAnd you thanked her by . . . YELLING AT HER. And not just yelling at her, but yelling nasty, paranoid, accusatory things at her. Because she bought you the birthday present of your dreams and gave it to you at a party she organised just for you. And you did all that: yelling, accusing, and flat-out HUMILIATING her, as a thank you for being nothing but loving and generous, in front of all of your close friends.\n\nAnd you, a 34-year-old man, have to ask if you were an asshole for humiliating your loving, generous girlfriend in front of everyone you know because she wanted to make your birthday as special as possible. \n\nIf you have to ask, I'm not even sure how to make you comprehend it. You need therapy. Like, SO. MUCH. THERAPY. Your response is hateful, but also deeply, deeply unhealthy. You looked at a gesture of incredibly kindness and generosity, and your first instinct was to see your loving partner in THE WORST POSSIBLE LIGHT, to view her through the ugliest, most insecure and vicious lens.

Grow up before your single af", "YTA. \n\nIt's one thing to baulk at the price tag and even bring it up (**in private after the guests have left**) if it makes you uncomfortable that she is spending that much, but the fact that you immediately jumped to \"she's trying to show me up\" is troubling and shows that it's less about thinking she spent too much and more about feeling that she is doing this intentionally to spite you. If you truly think that's the case and it's not your insecurities then why are you with someone who would do that? \n\nYour outburst didn't do you any favors with your friends.

You could've talked to her about it after the party, in private, but no. You let all your friends see that.", "Sorry to say, yes.  And you know it.", "\u201cO noooo my partner shows me off to our friends and spoils me too lavishly!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s you.", "You are such a steaming pile of excrement. I hope she dumps your ass asap. You're a toxic, frail masculinity, waste of oxygen. Ungrateful, immature, dumb, insecure, patehtic - all the traits women of any worth are looking for. What a loser.", "YTA.  Do you feel emasculated because a woman spent money on you? That's what it sounds like.  I don't understand why she would want you to be happy if this is how you treat her.", "Dude you messed up bad. Definitely YTA. Go buy some flowers and grovel for your amazing girlfriend to take you back.\n\nNot only did she buy you something she knew you would love but she organized a surprise party with all your close friends. So ungrateful.", "YTA, you have some serious issues to deal with.", "YTA, you acted like a fucking freak because you got a nice gift. Why? Because it was exactly what you wanted, and that somehow made you feel threatened? Jesus Christ.", "Insecure mini-dick asshole. I hope she leaves you so she can be happy with someone who actually deserves her. And I hope you go bald.", "Yta and u dont deserve her. How can u not see how it would feel if u were in her shoes? The fuck?", "The only correct response to any gift, regardless of the cost, is \"thank you\". Anything other than that makes you an asshole, yes. Like, just admit that you feel emasculated because your girlfriend is the breadwinner and you're not.", "YTA, I feel bad for your ex girlfriend.", "YTA and I am too. Grew up poor, don't make a lot of money. My job is kind of a hobby compared to my wife's salary. I know how you feel. Get professional help and keep that woman. She doesn't care about how insecure you are. She wants someone to share her successful life. Your lucky. Enjoy life and don't self destruct. There's too much sadness and pain in this world. Don't add yourself to it.", "So you got mad because she gave you something you always wanted. What a monster. How dare she. How would she feel if she was poor and her man bought her something expensive. People like that just\u2026they just can\u2019t help lording their money over everybody. Sheesh who does she think she is to you. Just dump her. She crossed the line.  She obviously doesn\u2019t understand you. And to make matters worse on your birthday. What a crime. \n\nIn case you don\u2019t get it your a insecure AH. It\u2019s not for her to deal with your insecurities. It\u2019s a gift. Just a gift. Please get help, you can get therapy for feeling inadequate for your financial status.", "If OPs GF is a redditor please leave this man it\u2019s only gonna get worse once he thinks y\u2019all should \u201cshare\u201d finances.", "\"I think we should use the whip instead of the paddle, do you concur Doctor?\" Love it.", "Oops! You let it cook too long and you get Raider Dave. *chuckles* every time", "It feels SOOOOOOO good to buy the people you love something you know is perfect for them.\n\nI was poor as shit growing up, so being able to spoil the people I love is absolutely the best. I love buying people meals when we go out, or just something I see that I know they'll love.\n\nI'm an awkward receiver of gifts, but awkward isn't asshole. I'm always incredibly grateful, I could never even conceive thinking someone was trying to show me up by buying me something cool?!\n\nThis dude must have missed out on so many great people by hauling around that giant ass insecure chip on his shoulder.", "\ud83d\ude02\u201cI can\u2019t facepalm myself hard enough\u201d \ud83e\udd23", "NTA for sure", "This right here. I thought \"he's difficult to get along with\" and \"he treats me badly sometimes\" but I thought that if I could just figure him out and work on myself enough, I could get him to stop treating me badly, and then I would be The One Girl who opened his heart and made him a better person with my love. It took me a long time to accept that he was fundamentally abusive.", "Same for my parents.

So boring & self-perpetuating.", "My ex-husband said the same. The reality is your last line. My ex was a shit partner, a shit parent, and a shit roommate.  Ut when he made more money, i fel like taking on that bulk was supporting him and alleviating some of the burden of caring for the family. When I started making working more/making more money, because he was working less, but he didn't pick up any slack is when it became very clear how one-sided the relationship was.", "Well if you are JK, move aside bc I\u2019m signing up!", "They're actively making their lives worse, they're doing the wrong thing by themselves, so under the sub's terminology, they're *the* asshole (or one of, given the abuser exists).\n\nI'm not trying to say escaping an abusive relationship is easy, hell from inside even *identifying* it isn't easy, but this is literally just a terminology thing.", "Sign me up!
