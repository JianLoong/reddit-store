Yesterday it was my birthday and my GF threw me a surprise birthday party and invited all of our close friends. There was probably 20 people there and it was hosted at our apartment. So at some point she pulls me towards the dinning room table to open presents. One of the presents was something that I always wanted a gaming laptop. The specs were so insane that she probably dropped 2500+ usd on it. When I pulled her aside to our bedroom and asked her how much she spent on it she was like \"don't worry about it honey I love you and want you to be happy\" but I wasn't going for it and thought she was trying to show me up in front of all our friends. When she tried to kiss me I pushed her away and said why do you always try to flex your money on me? So we got into a HUGE shouting match in front of all our friends and I finally left. I got a text from her this morning asking if we could talk and haven't replied to her cause I don't know what I should say. It's important to note that I don't make a lot of money and grew up poor and she grew up with money and makes a lot because she's a doctor.

She wanted to bless you (likely) because of the fact that you\u2019ve had a harder life and she wanted to be extravagant FOR you. You definitely need to apologize sincerely and work on your mindset. My guess is you feel inadequate because you can\u2019t reciprocate with fancy gifts (that\u2019s always my hang up) but people who love giving/getting gifts are looking more for the thought put into a gift than the amount of money.

She literally was as unselfish and open-hearted as it is possible to be in her celebration of you. \n\nAnd you thanked her by . . . YELLING AT HER. And not just yelling at her, but yelling nasty, paranoid, accusatory things at her. Because she bought you the birthday present of your dreams and gave it to you at a party she organised just for you. And you did all that: yelling, accusing, and flat-out HUMILIATING her, as a thank you for being nothing but loving and generous, in front of all of your close friends.\n\nAnd you, a 34-year-old man, have to ask if you were an asshole for humiliating your loving, generous girlfriend in front of everyone you know because she wanted to make your birthday as special as possible. \n\nIf you have to ask, I'm not even sure how to make you comprehend it. You need therapy. Like, SO. MUCH. THERAPY. Your response is hateful, but also deeply, deeply unhealthy. You looked at a gesture of incredibly kindness and generosity, and your first instinct was to see your loving partner in THE WORST POSSIBLE LIGHT, to view her through the ugliest, most insecure and vicious lens.

Grow up before your single af", "YTA. \n\nIt's one thing to baulk at the price tag and even bring it up (**in private after the guests have left**) if it makes you uncomfortable that she is spending that much, but the fact that you immediately jumped to \"she's trying to show me up\" is troubling and shows that it's less about thinking she spent too much and more about feeling that she is doing this intentionally to spite you. If you truly think that's the case and it's not your insecurities then why are you with someone who would do that? \n\nYour outburst didn't do you any favors with your friends.
