Yesterday it was my birthday and my GF threw me a surprise birthday party and invited all of our close friends. There was probably 20 people there and it was hosted at our apartment. So at some point she pulls me towards the dinning room table to open presents. One of the presents was something that I always wanted a gaming laptop. The specs were so insane that she probably dropped 2500+ usd on it. When I pulled her aside to our bedroom and asked her how much she spent on it she was like \"don't worry about it honey I love you and want you to be happy\" but I wasn't going for it and thought she was trying to show me up in front of all our friends. When she tried to kiss me I pushed her away and said why do you always try to flex your money on me? So we got into a HUGE shouting match in front of all our friends and I finally left. I got a text from her this morning asking if we could talk and haven't replied to her cause I don't know what I should say. It's important to note that I don't make a lot of money and grew up poor and she grew up with money and makes a lot because she's a doctor.

She wanted to bless you (likely) because of the fact that you\u2019ve had a harder life and she wanted to be extravagant FOR you. You definitely need to apologize sincerely and work on your mindset. My guess is you feel inadequate because you can\u2019t reciprocate with fancy gifts (that\u2019s always my hang up) but people who love giving/getting gifts are looking more for the thought put into a gift than the amount of money.

She literally was as unselfish and open-hearted as it is possible to be in her celebration of you. \n\nAnd you thanked her by . . . YELLING AT HER. And not just yelling at her, but yelling nasty, paranoid, accusatory things at her. Because she bought you the birthday present of your dreams and gave it to you at a party she organised just for you. And you did all that: yelling, accusing, and flat-out HUMILIATING her, as a thank you for being nothing but loving and generous, in front of all of your close friends.\n\nAnd you, a 34-year-old man, have to ask if you were an asshole for humiliating your loving, generous girlfriend in front of everyone you know because she wanted to make your birthday as special as possible. \n\nIf you have to ask, I'm not even sure how to make you comprehend it. You need therapy. Like, SO. MUCH. THERAPY. Your response is hateful, but also deeply, deeply unhealthy. You looked at a gesture of incredibly kindness and generosity, and your first instinct was to see your loving partner in THE WORST POSSIBLE LIGHT, to view her through the ugliest, most insecure and vicious lens.

Grow up before your single af", "YTA. \n\nIt's one thing to baulk at the price tag and even bring it up (**in private after the guests have left**) if it makes you uncomfortable that she is spending that much, but the fact that you immediately jumped to \"she's trying to show me up\" is troubling and shows that it's less about thinking she spent too much and more about feeling that she is doing this intentionally to spite you. If you truly think that's the case and it's not your insecurities then why are you with someone who would do that? \n\nYour outburst didn't do you any favors with your friends.

You're lucky and don't even know it.", "YTA You are being crushed to death by the giant chip on your shoulder and you are completely standing in your own way.", "Wow, you have a lot of growing up to do. I hope she breaks up with you .. you sound like a drag. YTA", "YTA\u2026. Were you never taught how to accept a gift with grace? I hope she dumps your frail, fragile, massive red flag waving ass", "You\u2019re a very insecure man, and if she stays with you she must be just as insecure. YTA, obviously", "YTA!!!!! You, according to your own post, have ALWAYS wanted a gaming laptop. So she gets you one, sounds like a top of the line one, AS A GIFT, on your birthday which isn\u2019t a time you\u2019re expected to reciprocate. And your first reaction isn\u2019t \u201cwow she really care about me\u201d, it\u2019s \u201cshe\u2019s trying to make me look bad in front of my friends\u201d. You need to dig deep and think about what YOU bring to the table and what you\u2019ve done for her that makes you feel that way. On top of that you couldn\u2019t even bother to be mature and wait until after the party to have this discussion. It\u2019s actually NOT important to mention your socioeconomic backgrounds because you didn\u2019t make the argument about spending money in general, or that you think she spent too much on a non-essential item, you said \u201cwhy do you always try to flex your money on me\u201d. Sounds like you have some insecurities to work through, which are neither your girlfriend\u2019s fault nor her responsibility. She deserves better.", "YTA, she got you something that you wanted and you got mad at the cost...OF SOMETHING YOU WANTED! You're insecure and need to apologize profusely", "Dude, I tell my girlfriend not to buy me certain things all the time due to cost. And what did she get me for Christmas? An extremely nice limited edition hockey jersey.\n\nDid I make a scene? No. Some happy tears were shed because I never thought I'd be able to afford one for myself, but she just got a big ass hug and I wore that jersey for the rest of Christmas.\n\n#YTA", "She organized a party for your birthday, invited people, and got you a present. Instead of being thankful, you called it a flex move. \n\nYou threw a tantrum and left? Are you a toddler?\n\nIf you are so insecure, don't date a woman who earns more than you.\n\nYTA", "YTA and you won\u2019t have a girlfriend for long. I hope your next one treats you exactly as you deserve. This one can go find someone who will appreciate her.", "I can't believe I am going to say this \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\n\nBut NTA \n\nI know I know. \n\nLook if there is an issue with her earning more, that's one thing and if it is an issue for him, then yes he wbtah.\n\nBut something feels not right\n\nDang it I know whose side I am supposed to be on. \n\nBut birthdays are embarrassing. Opening presents in front of everyone, especially very expensive presents, feels..  performative. So coming from a similar background, I can kind of see where he is coming from\n\nI know. I know I am a bad feminist. I accept the AHness of my dissent.", "ESH", "I make a butt load more than my dude. I bought him a ps5 because I thought he'd like it, you know what happened? He said, \"holy crap, thank you baby, this is amazing!\"\n\nThen he went to brag to his boys about how his awesome girl bought him this great treat.\n\nDude needs to set that insecure toxic crap aside and appreciate what someone who cares for you wanted to do.", "Yeah. I wanna hug the poor girl.", "RaiderDave89 for First Gentleman 2024!", "Everything, everything is wrong with him.\n\nYTA OP such an AH!", "Friends reaction no.1: 'lucky little shit'.\nFriends reaction no.2: 'ungrateful little shit'.\n\nYTA, OP.", "Well said!!", "You are why I keep coming back here. Love this comment. OP, YTA.", "Yes!!! If she is able to get Op something that he really wants without making herself broke, he should be appreciative and not be an asshole questioning her. He\u2019s a walking red flag. YTA and he really needs to get over himself and stop being such an asshole.", "YTA for all of these things \ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb", "I really love you. So damn much.", "I was going to give him my not so humble opinion but yours is so much better. So to sum it up, YTA ! I hope she reads this and wakes up.", ">toxic masculinity, outdated gender roles\n\nWhat would you have said if this had been a same-sex couple?\n\nEdit: I do not accept large gifts from anyone other than a SO.  It has nothing to do with gender roles but rather bad experiences.", "I wish I could give you an award \ud83e\udd47", "Yeah dude landed a gf that\u2019s a doctor and he\u2019s picking these fights? Crazy", "Or tool or both.", "Are you thinking of Apple Watch guy? It\u2019s getting so hard to tell all the shitty stories apart now.", "I get that, but shouting at her for \"showing him up\"? If anything, she's showing up his friends and giving him something he said he wanted, showing their friends that he has someone who cares. Half of them are probably wondering jow he got her instead of them.\n\nHe is definitely the AH, but if her money was an issue, she could of given it in private if he had discussed it with her before.", "Exactly.  With all of the elitism in this world, he has a doctor looking past the societal BS and loving him for who he is.  And this is how he repayed her.  I hope she starts sleeping around with a doctor at work.", "Is this worse than the poster whose friend refused to eat an entire giant piece of cake and she took it as a personal attack?", "Damn, so insecure. And his insecurities definitely put all this at risk.\n\nYTA", "I doubt he took it with him...", "Except it's not...nice whataboutism.", "I\u2019m suspecting a bit of jealousy on his part. No one who is happy in their relationship would lash out like he did.", "He wasn't going for it: means he doesn't accept gift. If he does, well, he just wants to pretend he's not fragile idiot.", "You jump to sexism absent any evidence other than OP's gender?  Making assumptions about such things is sexism on your part.  \n\nSome people just don't like expensive gifts from anyone.", "We had a story here awhile back from a woman who grew up in poverty and became engaged to a rich man.  She insisted on paying her way in every regard, splitting the bills equally, wouldn't let him treat her, and even refused an heirloom gift from his mother because she could not reciprocate.  Eventually everything worked out.\n\nWould you have concluded she was sexist or a toxic feminist?\n\nI agree OP's an AH, but I think your reasoning about his motives is colored by your own prejudices.  That's why I asked what assumptions you would have made  with only a change in one person's gender.  And you don't have an answer.", "I agree. If he says \"I won't accept this\" or \"I refuse this\" or pushes it back toward her, that is a rejection, and there is no change of ownership. However, if he makes criticisms, he is still taking possession."]}
