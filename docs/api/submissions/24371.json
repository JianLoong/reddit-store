Unless you try to do something about all of this it will continue.\n\n>Wife is pissed that I've been insulting her family\n\nHas she been able to explain why you're wrong about them?", "NTA\n\nI have a family issue similar to this and am also the youngest. While I\u2019m not married and nor is my mother retired. Often times in the past my family would ask me for money despite my own situation, I\u2019m a full time college student with a double major and I work a part time job and it\u2019s still not enough, I helped. That was until recently. I stopped because I don\u2019t have the stability to help them or pay for the things they want when I live on my own in a dorm. \n\nSometimes families don\u2019t see your own situation but rather their own and how they can benefit from you. \n\nHas this kind of situation been a tend since you\u2019ve been together? Since you\u2019ve known your wife have they always leaned on her?", "NTA but it is important to recognize that your wife may have had to step into the \u201celdest daughter\u201d role at a young age given her family\u2019s background and may have had grow up more quickly or step into the substitute parent role. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t think it was good to blow up on her as you say, it may worthy to communicate with her why you see her helping out her siblings as a concern. Communicate with her that she is continuing to enable her siblings further with no consequences for their actions. They are adult, able bodied individuals who can take care of themselves. If she doesn\u2019t address this now, it will only get worse. I\u2019ve included my mom\u2019s experience below as reference:\n\nMy mom is the eldest daughter of 7 children and she has been taking care of her siblings since she was 13 (it started with taking care of her siblings while my grandparents worked). My grandparents do not see any issues with this (even at her age now) and sometimes I have seen them take advantage of her because she enables them to. Now she\u2019s at an age where she is tired and feels like her family only sees her as a cash cow and that if she didn\u2019t help them out, they wouldn\u2019t willingly associate with her. Mind you, she is 50 now and she is tired of helping everyone but because she\u2019s been supporting them for so long, she can\u2019t seem to make herself stop. And what\u2019s worse is that her siblings and my grandparents still expect her to help and get angry if she doesn\u2019t.", "NTA but it sounds like your spouse doesn\u2019t have good boundaries in that she feels responsible for her family. Maybe revisit the issue and instead of insulting her siblings, talk about your feelings. Tell her you feel frustrated when\u2026. You feel angry that\u2026. Maybe she will understand your point and stop feeling the need to be defensive.\n\nI speak from experience because my mom tried to guilt me into taking care of my brother who is a year younger than me and can\u2019t keep a job because of mental illness. My mom used to say things like, \u201cFamilies help each other.\u201d And \u201cbrother is so pitiful, he can\u2019t help himself.\u201d So I understand where your spouse is coming from, but every road has an end. You can\u2019t help someone that doesn\u2019t want to help themselves; they\u2019re just freeloaders.", "NTA! never play along with passive aggressive family dynamics, but you must get your wife on board first. Make and keep rules about promising to help and/or give money. Ex. She tells family \u201dI\u2019ll discuss it with hubs and get back,\u201d etc. There\u2018s \u201chelp\u201d and there\u2019s freeloading \u2026 make sure your wife sees the difference. Sit down with her and make common sense boundaries.", "NTA but...\n\nShe'll leave you and find a dude who'll happily help her with her family, financially. Sorry dude, it's just how it is.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Nope. Unless y\u2019all are swimming in money, she should pay for her family from her personal funds without touching the joint accounts, savings, your personal fund. \n\nI laid that boundary down with my husband EARLY because I didn\u2019t want to spend a penny more than I was willing to keep his irresponsible parents afloat. It\u2019s been working for us so far. He\u2019s also cut down giving his family because of how it affected his personal funds. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to help family when you\u2019ve roped your spouse into giving up their money for them too.\n\nI didn\u2019t join finances with my husband until later on for this very reason. I needed him to see firsthand how he would\u2019ve managed by himself and how much he could actually afford without me in the mix. He got a reality check real quick.", "No, it's just the blanket \"they're my family and I care about them\". She agrees that they ask for too much but refuses to call them out on it. I finally got her to at least consider saying no, we'll see how long that lasts.", "They started leaning on her the instant they knew we were working, I was from a middle class family, and saw that we bought our first house.
