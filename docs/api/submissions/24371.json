Unless you try to do something about all of this it will continue.\n\n>Wife is pissed that I've been insulting her family\n\nHas she been able to explain why you're wrong about them?", "NTA\n\nI have a family issue similar to this and am also the youngest. While I\u2019m not married and nor is my mother retired. Often times in the past my family would ask me for money despite my own situation, I\u2019m a full time college student with a double major and I work a part time job and it\u2019s still not enough, I helped. That was until recently. I stopped because I don\u2019t have the stability to help them or pay for the things they want when I live on my own in a dorm. \n\nSometimes families don\u2019t see your own situation but rather their own and how they can benefit from you. \n\nHas this kind of situation been a tend since you\u2019ve been together? Since you\u2019ve known your wife have they always leaned on her?", "NTA but it is important to recognize that your wife may have had to step into the \u201celdest daughter\u201d role at a young age given her family\u2019s background and may have had grow up more quickly or step into the substitute parent role. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t think it was good to blow up on her as you say, it may worthy to communicate with her why you see her helping out her siblings as a concern. Communicate with her that she is continuing to enable her siblings further with no consequences for their actions. They are adult, able bodied individuals who can take care of themselves. If she doesn\u2019t address this now, it will only get worse. I\u2019ve included my mom\u2019s experience below as reference:\n\nMy mom is the eldest daughter of 7 children and she has been taking care of her siblings since she was 13 (it started with taking care of her siblings while my grandparents worked). My grandparents do not see any issues with this (even at her age now) and sometimes I have seen them take advantage of her because she enables them to. Now she\u2019s at an age where she is tired and feels like her family only sees her as a cash cow and that if she didn\u2019t help them out, they wouldn\u2019t willingly associate with her. Mind you, she is 50 now and she is tired of helping everyone but because she\u2019s been supporting them for so long, she can\u2019t seem to make herself stop. And what\u2019s worse is that her siblings and my grandparents still expect her to help and get angry if she doesn\u2019t.", "NTA but it sounds like your spouse doesn\u2019t have good boundaries in that she feels responsible for her family. Maybe revisit the issue and instead of insulting her siblings, talk about your feelings. Tell her you feel frustrated when\u2026. You feel angry that\u2026. Maybe she will understand your point and stop feeling the need to be defensive.\n\nI speak from experience because my mom tried to guilt me into taking care of my brother who is a year younger than me and can\u2019t keep a job because of mental illness. My mom used to say things like, \u201cFamilies help each other.\u201d And \u201cbrother is so pitiful, he can\u2019t help himself.\u201d So I understand where your spouse is coming from, but every road has an end. You can\u2019t help someone that doesn\u2019t want to help themselves; they\u2019re just freeloaders.", "NTA! never play along with passive aggressive family dynamics, but you must get your wife on board first. Make and keep rules about promising to help and/or give money. Ex. She tells family \u201dI\u2019ll discuss it with hubs and get back,\u201d etc. There\u2018s \u201chelp\u201d and there\u2019s freeloading \u2026 make sure your wife sees the difference. Sit down with her and make common sense boundaries.", "NTA but...\n\nShe'll leave you and find a dude who'll happily help her with her family, financially. Sorry dude, it's just how it is.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Nope. Unless y\u2019all are swimming in money, she should pay for her family from her personal funds without touching the joint accounts, savings, your personal fund. \n\nI laid that boundary down with my husband EARLY because I didn\u2019t want to spend a penny more than I was willing to keep his irresponsible parents afloat. It\u2019s been working for us so far. He\u2019s also cut down giving his family because of how it affected his personal funds. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to help family when you\u2019ve roped your spouse into giving up their money for them too.\n\nI didn\u2019t join finances with my husband until later on for this very reason. I needed him to see firsthand how he would\u2019ve managed by himself and how much he could actually afford without me in the mix. He got a reality check real quick.", "No, it's just the blanket \"they're my family and I care about them\". She agrees that they ask for too much but refuses to call them out on it. I finally got her to at least consider saying no, we'll see how long that lasts.", "They started leaning on her the instant they knew we were working, I was from a middle class family, and saw that we bought our first house. Funny timing.", "Family financial abuse is a bitch.", "She should probably do that or she's welcome to spend her own money. I totally understand OP, I wouldn't want to finance a bunch of losers either.", "You don\u2019t have to save family (or anybody) from their own bad decisions. You don\u2019t have to let yourself be dragged down by their bad decisions either. \n\nSounds like she cares about them not drowning by their own actions more than she cares about how much harder she\u2019s making it for you to swim.", "I'm just telling him, you can be right but still make the wrong choice. Tread carefully, friend.", "Part of it is her mom, who also is an enabler.

My inlaws have the same idea, and whenever I ask them what their plan is, they answer that\u2019s why they have kids. My wife and I are 5 years away from FIRE\u2019ing, and no way am I postponing that just so I can take care of her parents. BTW, NTA. I will say seperate your finances, and you each cover half of the bills. What your wife does with her extra money is up to her", "NTA. As hard as it is, sometimes people won't help themselves when they know they can rely on someone else.", "NTA. Your wife is endangering your future. You and your wife need to set a budget and follow it. You should make sure retirement and emergency savings come first. Then you need to have a conversation about how much is reasonable to help family.  You should further each have an account with a set amount for frivolous spending.  Once the family help is spent, she can choose to use her frivolous spending.  If it\u2019s beyond that, \u201csorry, we aren\u2019t able to help right now.\u201d  If she can\u2019t or won\u2019t agree to this, marital counseling.  Otherwise, you will be in mother-in-law\u2019s shoes, retired with no savings expecting someone else to support you. Good luck!", "NTA and this is not sustainable. Sit down with your wife and a spreadsheet and show her exactly how much her generous heart is costing you and then shut down the money flow. Don't insult, just stick to the numbers. \nNot much you can do about MIL, though unless there are health issues, she should be working at least part time to help with household costs.", "NTA This is on your, OP. Shut it down, or you will end up homeless.  If you have to, lock the accounts, move your money to keep it from your wife. You can always call the Freeloaders and tell them straight up there money train detailed. All your wife where she will live with her mom, after you divorce her.", "NTA separate your finances and put your household money in joint account and all your other money in a personal account and let her use her spare money to send to them. It\u2019s not ok for her \u201chelping\u201d her family is taking from you. Your work hard for your money not for it to be handed away to people who have made choices to be where they are.", "you have a wife problem. she is enabling all that behaviour. she needs to grow a spine and stop those demands. or get another job to pay for her family. which still cuts into family time. \n\nNTA", "NTA stop bthe money train.\n\nThey don't have money for food then YOU buy them some groceries. They need someone else - they need to find a job .\n\nGet your wife some counseling to learn to set boundaries and tell Mil if she guilts your wife once again bshe better have a place to stay cause she'll be out on her a$$", "NTA\u2026you cracked.  But you owe your wife an apology for talking to her the way you did.  But you need to have a serious discussion with her.  Let her know you are willing to help MIL, but the gravy train stops for the rest.  They are adults and in charge of their own lives.  They have to live by the actions of their consequences, you and your wife do not.  Not only will they never grow up if wife continues to bail them out, but what about your future?   If you spend your money on them, who is going to help you?", "NTA for bringing up the topic of her relatives. Definite Y T A for being insulting.  If you want to bring her around to your way of thinking, explain the concept of helping them by not enabling them anymore.  Explain that alcoholics need to admit to needing help before they will get help, and giving them $$ is just helping them stay on the booze.", "NTA. Maybe your wife is looking at it from the side of wanting to keep the family together despite everything, and those cases are a little complex to handle. You could start by making your partner see little by little the illogical and unfair situation expressing it more as a concern for something that is disturbing your marriage rather than as an attack on her family, since I do not think it is worth losing your wife for relatives toxics.\r  \n\r  \nMy dad has the same behavior but with all the family and relatives, it doesn\u2019t matter how much he\u2019s been swindled he keeps justifying them and considering them as the most sacred thing there is. Especially I do not recommend going directly to want to solve it at once because it is likely to get worse", "NTA! I been through the same situation as you. I paid and paid for my spouse\u2019s family\u2019s bills. We fought about it\u2026the in-laws kept making bad decisions over and over. I divorced my spouse!! My life is SO much better!! So is my bank acct. You need to think about that OR your life will be nothing but stress and fighting.", "In a similar situation, not quite as drastic, but it has been going on for many years now.\n\nI've refused help and put my foot down on my wife being a guarantor for her brother, who spends money when he has it like he's a millionaire.  We haven't gone abroad on holiday for a decade, he went one year three times.  We are saving up to do things, he slaps it on credit card.  When things go wrong, he comes crawling over to us.  \n\nWorse still, she has another brother who injured himself, did nothing about it and ended up crippled.  We all helped out, even me, I built him things so he could have comfort.  Problem is he has an attitude of a toddler.  What I built got chucked to one side as it was too big, I offered to change it, but was met with essentially insults.  Guy wants waiting on hand and foot, so I stopped helping explaining the exact reasons why.\n\nThings have come to a head, and amusingly my wife can see the problem with both brothers, each brother can see the problem with the other one, but neither can see the issue with themselves.  And my wife is always expected to pick up the slack.  It's pathetic and wrong.\n\nI feel for you.  NTA", "NTA. Is your wife going to get a second job to support her brothers?", "\"love doesn't pay bills...money does\"", "then she needs to be gone or sit down asap", ">Shady Pines Ma!\n\nMarathoning this with my son, was my grandma and moms favorite.
