Unless you try to do something about all of this it will continue.\n\n>Wife is pissed that I've been insulting her family\n\nHas she been able to explain why you're wrong about them?", "NTA\n\nI have a family issue similar to this and am also the youngest. While I\u2019m not married and nor is my mother retired. Often times in the past my family would ask me for money despite my own situation, I\u2019m a full time college student with a double major and I work a part time job and it\u2019s still not enough, I helped. That was until recently. I stopped because I don\u2019t have the stability to help them or pay for the things they want when I live on my own in a dorm. \n\nSometimes families don\u2019t see your own situation but rather their own and how they can benefit from you. \n\nHas this kind of situation been a tend since you\u2019ve been together? Since you\u2019ve known your wife have they always leaned on her?", "NTA but it is important to recognize that your wife may have had to step into the \u201celdest daughter\u201d role at a young age given her family\u2019s background and may have had grow up more quickly or step into the substitute parent role. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t think it was good to blow up on her as you say, it may worthy to communicate with her why you see her helping out her siblings as a concern. Communicate with her that she is continuing to enable her siblings further with no consequences for their actions. They are adult, able bodied individuals who can take care of themselves. If she doesn\u2019t address this now, it will only get worse. I\u2019ve included my mom\u2019s experience below as reference:\n\nMy mom is the eldest daughter of 7 children and she has been taking care of her siblings since she was 13 (it started with taking care of her siblings while my grandparents worked). My grandparents do not see any issues with this (even at her age now) and sometimes I have seen them take advantage of her because she enables them to. Now she\u2019s at an age where she is tired and feels like her family only sees her as a cash cow and that if she didn\u2019t help them out, they wouldn\u2019t willingly associate with her. Mind you, she is 50 now and she is tired of helping everyone but because she\u2019s been supporting them for so long, she can\u2019t seem to make herself stop. And what\u2019s worse is that her siblings and my grandparents still expect her to help and get angry if she doesn\u2019t.", "NTA but it sounds like your spouse doesn\u2019t have good boundaries in that she feels responsible for her family. Maybe revisit the issue and instead of insulting her siblings, talk about your feelings. Tell her you feel frustrated when\u2026. You feel angry that\u2026. Maybe she will understand your point and stop feeling the need to be defensive.\n\nI speak from experience because my mom tried to guilt me into taking care of my brother who is a year younger than me and can\u2019t keep a job because of mental illness. My mom used to say things like, \u201cFamilies help each other.\u201d And \u201cbrother is so pitiful, he can\u2019t help himself.\u201d So I understand where your spouse is coming from, but every road has an end. You can\u2019t help someone that doesn\u2019t want to help themselves; they\u2019re just freeloaders.", "NTA! never play along with passive aggressive family dynamics, but you must get your wife on board first. Make and keep rules about promising to help and/or give money. Ex. She tells family \u201dI\u2019ll discuss it with hubs and get back,\u201d etc. There\u2018s \u201chelp\u201d and there\u2019s freeloading \u2026 make sure your wife sees the difference. Sit down with her and make common sense boundaries.", "NTA but...\n\nShe'll leave you and find a dude who'll happily help her with her family, financially.

Nope. Unless y\u2019all are swimming in money, she should pay for her family from her personal funds without touching the joint accounts, savings, your personal fund. \n\nI laid that boundary down with my husband EARLY because I didn\u2019t want to spend a penny more than I was willing to keep his irresponsible parents afloat. It\u2019s been working for us so far.

I finally got her to at least consider saying no, we'll see how long that lasts.", "They started leaning on her the instant they knew we were working, I was from a middle class family, and saw that we bought our first house.

My inlaws have the same idea, and whenever I ask them what their plan is, they answer that\u2019s why they have kids. My wife and I are 5 years away from FIRE\u2019ing, and no way am I postponing that just so I can take care of her parents. BTW, NTA. I will say seperate your finances, and you each cover half of the bills. What your wife does with her extra money is up to her", "NTA. As hard as it is, sometimes people won't help themselves when they know they can rely on someone else.", "NTA. Your wife is endangering your future. You and your wife need to set a budget and follow it. You should make sure retirement and emergency savings come first. Then you need to have a conversation about how much is reasonable to help family.  You should further each have an account with a set amount for frivolous spending.  Once the family help is spent, she can choose to use her frivolous spending.  If it\u2019s beyond that, \u201csorry, we aren\u2019t able to help right now.\u201d  If she can\u2019t or won\u2019t agree to this, marital counseling.

Sit down with your wife and a spreadsheet and show her exactly how much her generous heart is costing you and then shut down the money flow.

But you owe your wife an apology for talking to her the way you did.  But you need to have a serious discussion with her.  Let her know you are willing to help MIL, but the gravy train stops for the rest.  They are adults and in charge of their own lives.  They have to live by the actions of their consequences, you and your wife do not.  Not only will they never grow up if wife continues to bail them out, but what about your future?   If you spend your money on them, who is going to help you?", "NTA for bringing up the topic of her relatives. Definite Y T A for being insulting.  If you want to bring her around to your way of thinking, explain the concept of helping them by not enabling them anymore.  Explain that alcoholics need to admit to needing help before they will get help, and giving them $$ is just helping them stay on the booze.", "NTA. Maybe your wife is looking at it from the side of wanting to keep the family together despite everything, and those cases are a little complex to handle. You could start by making your partner see little by little the illogical and unfair situation expressing it more as a concern for something that is disturbing your marriage rather than as an attack on her family, since I do not think it is worth losing your wife for relatives toxics.\r  \n\r  \nMy dad has the same behavior but with all the family and relatives, it doesn\u2019t matter how much he\u2019s been swindled he keeps justifying them and considering them as the most sacred thing there is.

I paid and paid for my spouse\u2019s family\u2019s bills. We fought about it\u2026the in-laws kept making bad decisions over and over. I divorced my spouse!! My life is SO much better!! So is my bank acct. You need to think about that OR your life will be nothing but stress and fighting.", "In a similar situation, not quite as drastic, but it has been going on for many years now.\n\nI've refused help and put my foot down on my wife being a guarantor for her brother, who spends money when he has it like he's a millionaire.  We haven't gone abroad on holiday for a decade, he went one year three times.  We are saving up to do things, he slaps it on credit card.  When things go wrong, he comes crawling over to us.  \n\nWorse still, she has another brother who injured himself, did nothing about it and ended up crippled.  We all helped out, even me, I built him things so he could have comfort.  Problem is he has an attitude of a toddler.  What I built got chucked to one side as it was too big, I offered to change it, but was met with essentially insults.  Guy wants waiting on hand and foot, so I stopped helping explaining the exact reasons why.\n\nThings have come to a head, and amusingly my wife can see the problem with both brothers, each brother can see the problem with the other one, but neither can see the issue with themselves.  And my wife is always expected to pick up the slack.  It's pathetic and wrong.\n\nI feel for you.  NTA", "NTA.

I am in a similar situation, my wife's family is pay check to pay check, parents nearly wound up with no place to live.  Here is the difference, my wife broke free (but she mostly did it before we were together).  We don't help them at all.  If your wife can't agree to boundaries around money, this may be a marriage dealbreaker.  My FIL came from a middle-class family, had a good banking job for most of his life, but was in your position and now is living in his sister's apartment (because they were going to be homeless) with his 50 year old, never worked son.  SIL is in an in-law at her in-laws with no job.  This is a long way of saying you either break free or you are taken down with them.  I'm very sorry for you, but it is going to take you down too if you don't stop it.  I've been watching this happen to FIL for 20+ years.  Also so proud of my wife for making it out.", "NTA.

Entire family does not know how to long-term plan. Poverty mindset.", "She got tired of working a shitty part time retail job and the pandemic conveniently happened at the same time. She retired early enough to screw herself out of an extra 2-300 of social security. Literally 6 months and could've gotten full benefits.

If I had a boss this is the same thing I would say about a business decision. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou and your wife need to sit down look at your finances and come up with a realistic number you genuinely BOTH feel comfortable giving to her family that needs it.

Now that doesnt mean emergency's cant call for \"special meetings.\"\n\nIf you and you your wife can not sit down and come to an agreement on a real number.

My money usage got better after I stopped being around my family often. Due to a TON of family issues this past month Ive hung out with them a lot and my money was being drained from me.\n\nI say this because I think you need to sit down with your wife and explain to her that they are just using her. I agree with the comment before mine, if it is a necessity like groceries then you help.
