Unless you try to do something about all of this it will continue.\n\n>Wife is pissed that I've been insulting her family\n\nHas she been able to explain why you're wrong about them?", "NTA\n\nI have a family issue similar to this and am also the youngest. While I\u2019m not married and nor is my mother retired. Often times in the past my family would ask me for money despite my own situation, I\u2019m a full time college student with a double major and I work a part time job and it\u2019s still not enough, I helped. That was until recently. I stopped because I don\u2019t have the stability to help them or pay for the things they want when I live on my own in a dorm. \n\nSometimes families don\u2019t see your own situation but rather their own and how they can benefit from you. \n\nHas this kind of situation been a tend since you\u2019ve been together? Since you\u2019ve known your wife have they always leaned on her?", "NTA but it is important to recognize that your wife may have had to step into the \u201celdest daughter\u201d role at a young age given her family\u2019s background and may have had grow up more quickly or step into the substitute parent role. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t think it was good to blow up on her as you say, it may worthy to communicate with her why you see her helping out her siblings as a concern. Communicate with her that she is continuing to enable her siblings further with no consequences for their actions. They are adult, able bodied individuals who can take care of themselves. If she doesn\u2019t address this now, it will only get worse. I\u2019ve included my mom\u2019s experience below as reference:\n\nMy mom is the eldest daughter of 7 children and she has been taking care of her siblings since she was 13 (it started with taking care of her siblings while my grandparents worked). My grandparents do not see any issues with this (even at her age now) and sometimes I have seen them take advantage of her because she enables them to. Now she\u2019s at an age where she is tired and feels like her family only sees her as a cash cow and that if she didn\u2019t help them out, they wouldn\u2019t willingly associate with her. Mind you, she is 50 now and she is tired of helping everyone but because she\u2019s been supporting them for so long, she can\u2019t seem to make herself stop. And what\u2019s worse is that her siblings and my grandparents still expect her to help and get angry if she doesn\u2019t.", "NTA but it sounds like your spouse doesn\u2019t have good boundaries in that she feels responsible for her family. Maybe revisit the issue and instead of insulting her siblings, talk about your feelings. Tell her you feel frustrated when\u2026. You feel angry that\u2026. Maybe she will understand your point and stop feeling the need to be defensive.\n\nI speak from experience because my mom tried to guilt me into taking care of my brother who is a year younger than me and can\u2019t keep a job because of mental illness. My mom used to say things like, \u201cFamilies help each other.\u201d And \u201cbrother is so pitiful, he can\u2019t help himself.\u201d So I understand where your spouse is coming from, but every road has an end. You can\u2019t help someone that doesn\u2019t want to help themselves; they\u2019re just freeloaders.", "NTA! never play along with passive aggressive family dynamics, but you must get your wife on board first. Make and keep rules about promising to help and/or give money. Ex. She tells family \u201dI\u2019ll discuss it with hubs and get back,\u201d etc. There\u2018s \u201chelp\u201d and there\u2019s freeloading \u2026 make sure your wife sees the difference.

Maybe your wife is looking at it from the side of wanting to keep the family together despite everything, and those cases are a little complex to handle.

When things go wrong, he comes crawling over to us.  \n\nWorse still, she has another brother who injured himself, did nothing about it and ended up crippled.

What I built got chucked to one side as it was too big, I offered to change it, but was met with essentially insults.

We didn't plan for kids or really want any, but had to seriously consider taking care of our young nephew at one point after he got held back a grade or two after his dad's DUI and the pandemic hit. Really unstable household. Single dad and semi-absent mother.", "Preach.", "She's verbally and mentally abusive to her family and wonders why half of them are LC/NC and her meager money won't buy them back while she's simultaneously fussing at them for not finding Jesus", "Take the kid, leave the cannoli (cannoli, in this case, are the full grown adults who refuse to get their lives together and wouldn't be vulnerable children in  a system designed to break them).", "Your wife is a married adult now. She has to come to terms with the fact that her mother is not a great person, and that the consequences she created for her children is not your fault or your wife's fault. It sounds like your wife is stuck in a trapped child's mindset of thinking dysfunction is normal and not growing beyond that for herself and her relationships.", "I actually bought my son the box set for his birthday, along with the nanny, cause those were our family go-to every morning growing up lol.", "NTA\n\nI hope you have separate finances.  If not, start your own accounts immediately.  Joint account for household bills, etc only.  You both need to contribute equally.\n\nDo not let her use your money to continue to support her family. \n\nIf she tries to sneak funds to worthless siblings, it is hers and at least you are not funding them.  If she doesn't have the income to help them, oh well.", "NTA Stop helping these freeloaders. They need to deal with the consequences of their actions. If you keep this up, you will end up supporting them their entire lives.", "Overall NTA with a mild admonishment that insults don\u2019t help.\n\nSit down with your wife, with your MIL out of the house, and make a budget of \u201cfamily money\u201d. Just, plan it. And then make a list of rules: \n\n1) No cash. Only prepaid cards (like gas cards) or direct payments to the company. \n\n2) all requests for money need to come to both of you. Joint text or email. \n\n3) deal with your MIL. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going with your MIL, but she cannot afford to retire. She needs to go back to work, even if it\u2019s a little part-time thing. \n\nIf she can\u2019t work\u2014due to illness or disability\u2014you need to sign her up for every program under the sun, and also find out what\u2019s going on with her Social Security checks, as well as her survivor\u2019s benefits from her husband.\n\nTaking her money is elder abuse, but working out financial arrangements so she covers her own expenses is worthwhile.\n\n4) Your wife will say \u201cno\u201d. If after a \u201cno\u201d her family freaks out and throws a fit, they get cut off entirely until they learn to behave. \n\n5) your wife will admit her family has several alcoholics and that giving them money will not save them from those consequences. They\u2019re not homeless because she refused money, they\u2019re homeless because they\u2019re an addict that prioritized their addiction over being housed. \n\nBeing an addict isn\u2019t a moral failing. It\u2019s just what it is, and money cannot cure it.\n\nIf your wife refuses to follow through on any of this\u2014even if she says she will and then sneaks around your back\u2014it\u2019s up to you if you want to live like this forever.", "You are not responsible for your in-laws poor decision making in life.  Giving away large amounts of money to family needs to be an agreed upon decision and not something one should be guilted into doing.  NTAH here but your wife is getting close.", "NTA.  These ppl are causing they're own drama.  There's no good reason these ppl can't get jobs.  And if MIL is still physically & mentally able to work, then she should've never retired without a savings account.  That's just blatant stupidity.  It sounds to me that this family is living off handouts.  You can't continue to give them money.  By giving them money you are enabling them to continue to live the way they are living.  You need to cut them off now.", "NTA.   Sometimes or often ships you have to stop enabling others who have no problem dragging you down with them.", "NTA, Tell your wife you need to split your finances.  You can have a joint account where your expenses get paid out of.  She can use her money for her family.  You can save your money for your family.\n\nIf she is a stay at home mother or wife, take away her access to the account.  Set up another account where you will give her money and she can spend it as she see fit.  Also develop a budget if she is the primary shopper and and give her that money.\n\nI don't understand why people think they need to destroy their financial freedom to help people who will not help themselves.\n\nHave the MIL provide you 50% of her social security for rent, food, utilities and for driving her around.", "NTA.  MIL need a job or wife needs a second job (or a first) if they want to keep the freeloaders free to free load.  Seem to be plenty of people who want money who can work if they want to.

They have these amazing things called bicycles and rumor has it that a determined person can actually ride one ten miles or more!", "NTA. Your wife is digging her own grave here. My dad used to be the same, he is a doctor so he makes good money. My aunts and uncles ask him money frequently for paying their debt or buy thing. He gave and gave but it never enough, it like a dark hole", "Luckily, this isn't a problem. We've always had separate finances and our only joint account is solely for bills we both pay, so that account stays extremely optimized for those bills. I would notice withdrawals. She's using her money, and I've was using mine to prevent myself becoming \"that guy that won't help\", but I started saying no a while ago. Nowadays I just get the occasional passive agressive \"man, the horses are so expensive\" or \"wow, I don't know how I'm going to pay for the power bill/plumbing repair/phone bill\"", "> No, it's just the blanket \"they're my family and I care about them\".\n\nNTA, ask her \"I'm I not your family, do you not care about me.  Right now your actions and attitude towards your siblings are hurting me, both now, and long term.  Do you not care that you are hurting me?\"   \n    \nThe answer to that should let you know how to move forward, either she will stop enabling their poor behavior, or you should probably look at a divorce and getting out of the situation.", "Is she mentally competent? If not maybe you need to start looking at conservatorship. If she is you should start looking at setting up power of attorney, etc. so that when the decline happens you\u2019ll have a head start on protecting her from her children.", "> Oh yeah, it's been a few years into her \"retirement\". To be fair, MILs kids have no awareness and \"borrow\" money from her social security too. She's a victim and an enabler. I've explained to her that she has little income to give to them, and she falls back to the \"well they're my kids\" argument. Like talking to a wall.\n\nIf you decide to stay in this mess, you need to have your MIL sign of fiscal responsibility to you as a condition of staying with you.  That way, she won't be able to give her other kids the social security, and instead it will be used for her care and upkeep.", "The Nanny was also an awesome show. Your family has good taste. lol", "OP, I am the kid of parents that were in the same situation as you and your wife. You know what sucks? Grandma guilting mom into explaining to 12 year old me and my sister that summer camp isn't on the table this year because alcoholic aunt Sally and her 4 kids will be homeless if they can't make rent. You know what sucks more than that? Hearing your parents fight over whether alcoholic aunt Sally's kids are allowed to come live here when they are homeless, and wondering whether you are going to have to give up your room so they can all fit. And then you grow up wondering if you are a bad person because you wish alcoholic aunt Sally and her kids would just go away.\n\nIt really really sucks, but with a family like this you either establish strong boundaries or you get bled dry. My parents ended up separating their finances and my dad put money away for us while my mom got bled dry. It sucked. At least my dad put his foot down hard about any of mom's needy relatives living with us... well, after we'd had to evict my aunt and uncle and their creepy son.\n\nIt's been hard on all of us. My mom finally got to the point where she pulled back from enabling everyone, after my grandma passed and couldn't guilt her any more. I was in my 20s by then. My mom never got to take a proper vacation until I was in college because she spent all her money on her deadbeat relatives. \n\nNow that I'm older, I understand how hard it was on my mom. Her siblings were all screwed up because they were abused. She was the one who got out. She was the one who got a scholarship and had an opportunity and made it. But she still saw herself as one of them, and she didn't think it was fair that she got out and they didn't, and that guilt ate her alive. She finally got a crap ton of therapy after her mom died that let her see that she deserved a better life. But until she got that therapy, I think she believed that she needed to share in their suffering.\n\nI don't know, man. You can't easily pull someone out of caring for their family, even when doing so is super destructive. I would say that getting MIL out of the house is your first necessary step. And I don't even know if your wife will go for it. My dad is a super resourceful dude and he couldn't negotiate us away from the sib drama until after MIL was dead.\n\nGood luck.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, congrats on all the kids!
