My parents divorced about 9 years ago and about 5 years ago, my mom and brother (1 year older than me) passed away in an accident. My dad (39M) married Sarah (35F) when I was 9 so about a year before my mom and brother died.\n\nSarah is the jealous type. She doesn't like it when she hears people talk about my mom or brother and she has removed all traces of my mom and brother from the house (everywhere except my room). It became worse after my mom and brother died, and then much worse ever since she became pregnant and my little sister was born. She believes it's time for us to move on and focus on the family we have rather than the one we lost.\n\nWe fight a lot in the house, but we had a public fight yesterday. We were visiting my grandparents and I was talking to my aunt (dad's sister, who really liked my mom) and she was telling me about a nice memory of when my mom was pregnant with my brother. We were talking quietly so nobody except me, my aunt and cousin were part of the conversation but Sarah inserted herself and suggested that it's disrespectful to her to talk about my dad's ex during an event when she is present.\n\nI said \"Sarah keep walking, it's not about you\" but she took me to a corner and said this is our family policy to present a united front, and she is my dad's wife now with a baby and we should not mention his previous wife or son. I snapped and said you can't erase them no matter how much you try and you go fuck yourself. It was loud so everyone heard, she also shouted that I should show her some respect. I showed her a middle finger, said you're pathetic and jealous of people who died years ago and walked away.\n\nLast night my dad tried to mediate and suggest we both did wrong and should apologize to each other and move on, and neither of us are willing to do that. My dad says I was wrong to escalate in public and say those things, and she was wrong to push me in public, he believes we should have discussed the matter later as a family.\n\nSarah says she's tired of living in my mom's shadow and family don't love her like they did my mom, also says her daughter also lives in the shadow of my brother and doesn't have her own identity. I'm tired of her behavior and will not put up with it anymore. People who were there generally took my side though. I have support of both grandparents, aunt and several cousins who all told me they didn't know she was doing this to me and won't be inviting her to any events again. She has the support of my uncle's new wife who also believes the family like my uncle's ex wife better.\n\nSo after talking to my dad I'm wondering if I was an AH for not controlling my temper and maybe I could have avoided a public conflict which now everyone knows about.", "created_utc": 1702210774, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18f2f8b/aita_for_telling_my_step_mother_to_go_f_herself/", "score": 1210, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Definitely NTA. Holy smokes, what a gong show. The step mom, especially being that age, especially since they were already divorced when your dad and his new wife got married, the new wife must have hella bad insecurities to be worried about living in your mom\u2019s shadow. It would be one thing if the stepmom and your dad weren\u2019t married yet, and all he did was talk about your mom, still grieving her, etc. Then if the stepmom made a fuss about talking about her so much, that\u2019s one thing. But holy smokes it\u2019s your dead mother that YOU should be able to talk about whenever you like. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s been 1 year or 20 years. You AND your dad should be able to have conversations about her whenever you want to. Let alone any other family members or friends who knew her! Your dad may be right that both of you did something inappropriate by having an outburst in public in any other context. But when it comes to defending your deceased mother, and your stepmom complaining about you talking about her? That\u2019s so messed up on so many levels. She has no right to say a damn thing.

I hope you have supportive friends and that you see your aunt as often as possible to talk about your memories of your beloved mom without Sarah\u2019s odious presence. \n\nSarah is a small, spiteful and insecure person to be so jealous of your late mother and her place in your heart.", "Nta.\n\nYour stepmom is being absurd by demanding you present a \u201cunited front\u201d.

It seems your step mom doesn't realize that your dad (and you) will always love your mom dearly. She can never be replaced, and while she's not in your current chapter in life, whatever time you had with her shouldn't be erased or forgotten just because a new chapter has begun.", "First, I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nSecond, yes, you should work to control your temper.  Not because you were a jerk, but because it's a good life skill... and by keeping your temper you make it much more obvious how out of line the other person is (important for getting people on your side when necessary).\n\nThird, I recommend you talk to your dad privately about this because Sarah's comments and viewpoint aren't healthy for you to be around.  She doesn't want you to talk about or remember your *brother*.  Or your mother.  You just had a major loss and... she wants to pretend they didn't exist?!  That is wholly unkind to you AND is likely to push you away from what she wants anyway.   Therapy all around would be advisable.\n\nI'm going to recommend you practice some non-hostile boundary-placing sentences.  I dunno, maybe something like: \"It is important to me to remember and talk about all loved ones who have passed away.\"  or \"My family includes my late mother and brother and it's important for me to remember them.  Of course, you don't need to be part of that, but I am not going avoid talking about a major part of my life and important people in it\"\n\nIf you felt like offering an olive branch (because they can be useful) you could also say something like, \"If anything were to happen to you, I'd make sure <baby sister's name> would be supported in remembering you if that were important to her.\"   \n\n\nNTA", "I hope you can get out of their house soon, maybe college far away.

What is _very_ uncool is her desire to have all of you just forget.\n\nShe\u2019s probably very insecure about her place in the family, and doesn\u2019t want to compete with a ghost. That much is understandable. What is _not_ cool is her resistance to accepting that she\u2019ll never be a drop-in replacement your mother - nor should she try to be one.\n\nThe best you can do is to explain to her patiently that, even if she were the nicest stepmom in the whole world, she can\u2019t fully replace anyone. And that\u2019s okay, because nobody can. (I\u2019m surprised that you\u2019d need to explain this to an adult, but here we are.)\n\nIf she can\u2019t accept that, politely inform her that you also have feelings, that grief never completely disappears for anyone, and denial is _not_ a good coping strategy.

People \"like your mother better\" because Sarah herself has made herself unlikeable. Her behaviour at the party - intruding on a private conversation and causing a scene, when all she had to do was walk on by - is a prime example. And as for \"discuss it later\" - there's nothing to discuss. Your mother existed. People remember her fondly. Everyone who remembers her has a RIGHT to discuss those memories. Sarah only makes herself look bad (unlikeable and pathetic, really) when she shows objection to that. Tell her that, from all of us here at Reddit, please.", "NTA.

If my mom hadn't died and remarried instead (highly unlikely), I would fight anyone who tried to erase all traces of my dad.\n\nSarah is family to your dad, and that is it. She isnt your mom, and no matter how hard she tries to remove all traces of your mom, she will NEVER be your mom. Nor will she be more important than your mom. Franky, I wouldnt even refer to her as your \"stepmom\". She is just Sarah and thats it.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. Not one single bit. Your dad and Sarah are the ones at fault.

Sarah stuck her nose in; no one was trying to rub her nose in it. \n\nAnd with no disrespect meant in regards your late mother, the bit of this which gets my back up is her dismissal of your brother.\n\nSarah was a stepmom to ***two*** children. Your brother died a year after your dad married Sarah. And Sarah has wiped out all trace of your brother, her stepson, from the home.\n\nNow, she's claiming her little girl is living in the shadow of your late brother? Well, I can understand the loss of a child would make you and your little sister more precious to your dad, more poignant. But, unless your dad had been hoping for a son, it doesn't appear the claim is not justified and even *if* your father was hoping for another son, that is not your fault.\n\nIt sounds like your family are very supportive, and that's great. Sarah has declared she doesn't want your mom discussed when she's present at these events, now she won't be present at future events. However, the problem here is that they risk alienating your father, putting distance between your half-sister and them, and Sarah (falsely) blaming you for the fact she is no longer welcome.", "NTA because you are a teenager. Your step mother is way out of line and you should put her in her place. You are absolutely right this is not about her. But the language is the issue. You don't need to throw insults (despite feeling good) as it gives your step mom an \"out\" for her behaviour. I know it is not easy but biting your tongue and telling her clearly that she is overstepping. Is much more effective. If you are perfectly correct she will have no way to twist this. You need to talk to your dad and let him know that he has to take your side on this.", "Nta at all. These are your loved ones who you must miss desperately and talking about them is therapeutic. Your dad needs to get on your side here. She\u2019s acting like a jealous petulant child and neither are respecting your grief.

Good luck.", "NTA, sorry to say you have a very heart less step mum. She is playing victim, wants sympathy, forcing to be liked and also dragging your half sibling in her madness. I had a step mum like that. Thank God am old enough and I chose to never visit my father's house again. Anyway it's good other family members understand you. I can imagine how suffocating this is for you but also don't let anyone stop you from enjoying you late mom's memories. I hope she will change soon.", "NYA.

My parents divorced about 9 years ago and about 5 years ago, my mom and brother (1 year older than me) passed away in an accident. My dad (39M) married Sarah (35F) when I was 9 so about a year before my mom and brother died.\n\nSarah is the jealous type. She doesn't like it when she hears people talk about my mom or brother and she has removed all traces of my mom and brother from the house (everywhere except my room). It became worse after my mom and brother died, and then much worse ever since she became pregnant and my little sister was born. She believes it's time for us to move on and focus on the family we have rather than the one we lost.\n\nWe fight a lot in the house, but we had a public fight yesterday. We were visiting my grandparents and I was talking to my aunt (dad's sister, who really liked my mom) and she was telling me about a nice memory of when my mom was pregnant with my brother. We were talking quietly so nobody except me, my aunt and cousin were part of the conversation but Sarah inserted herself and suggested that it's disrespectful to her to talk about my dad's ex during an event when she is present.\n\nI said \"Sarah keep walking, it's not about you\" but she took me to a corner and said this is our family policy to present a united front, and she is my dad's wife now with a baby and we should not mention his previous wife or son. I snapped and said you can't erase them no matter how much you try and you go fuck yourself. It was loud so everyone heard, she also shouted that I should show her some respect. I showed her a middle finger, said you're pathetic and jealous of people who died years ago and walked away.\n\nLast night my dad tried to mediate and suggest we both did wrong and should apologize to each other and move on, and neither of us are willing to do that. My dad says I was wrong to escalate in public and say those things, and she was wrong to push me in public, he believes we should have discussed the matter later as a family.\n\nSarah says she's tired of living in my mom's shadow and family don't love her like they did my mom, also says her daughter also lives in the shadow of my brother and doesn't have her own identity. I'm tired of her behavior and will not put up with it anymore. People who were there generally took my side though. I have support of both grandparents, aunt and several cousins who all told me they didn't know she was doing this to me and won't be inviting her to any events again. She has the support of my uncle's new wife who also believes the family like my uncle's ex wife better.\n\nSo after talking to my dad I'm wondering if I was an AH for not controlling my temper and maybe I could have avoided a public conflict which now everyone knows about.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Please lean on the extended family that clearly loves you, like your aunt and cousin. They will help you keep the memory of your mom and brother in your heart.

She accuses you of not loving her like you did your mum. Well, no, of course not! She is not your mum, she is a completely different person. If she feels she is living in the shadow of a dead person, it is her own fault for not finding an appropriate place in the family. She has been expecting to be \"the mum\" to everyone, but that is delusional. She did not do her due diligence by talking to other step parents to find out what it is like and what she should bring to the table. All this, however, is not your problem to fix. It is mainly a problem between the two adults. Unfortunately it is a problem seen in *many* \"second families\". It is so common that you could almost write a manual and make it compulsory reading for step parents.", "NTA IMO the only other option was to talk to her like she was a child in front of everyone in that placating voice you use on kids when they are acting up and you want them to think. \"Other people feel differently than you do.

If they If it gets worse at home, make sure you record it. \n\nIn my experiences, the second you pull out a recording device, they know what they Are doing wrong and they stop yelling at you as much. That will only give you clarity that you know that you\u2019re not in the wrong because now they are trying to cover up their wrongs. \n\nAll of this will give you some more things to call her out over.

As someone who has lost my mother and had to deal with a stepmother for 99% of my life, this is absolutely not okay. My stepmother is quite wicked in her own ways, but she never once attacked my mother or told me it was time to get over it even 10 years after she passed.\n\nYour mom and brother are part of your family, alive or dead. You have a right to talk to others who know them about them. You have a right to talk to strangers about them if that's what you need.\n\nYour stepmother shouldn't be trying to erase your mom. I can see not wanting copious amounts of pictures of her around, but to basically say \"she never existed\" is wrong on so many levels. I have trauma from my stepmother, and even she wouldn't dare cross that line.\n\nYour father is equally in the wrong as your stepmother. The fact that he agrees that you don't talk about her, or your brother, is absolutely crazy. Your mother was once a very large part of your father's life, and so was your brother. I don't know if pretending they never existed makes the grief easier on him, but it's still absolutely wild to be okay with pretending two people, who you loved and cared for deeply, never existed.\n\nYou're not an a hole.

I can't act like she never existed. How can you be okay with pretending like mom and brother never existed?\" \n\nIf you broach the topic with your step mom (not advised in my opinion) I'd start by asking her:\n\n\"How you l would you like it, if you suddenly had a new women enter your dad's life, and then tell you that you can never talk to anyone about your real mom?

Step-mum is opposing that fact and therfore disrespecting OP at family functions and within the familys home.

If she can't accept the fact people can love more than one person in their lifetime then she was too emotionally immature to be dateing let alone marrying into a pre-existing family.
