In what way is it fair to their son that he has to be known as a repeat pool-shitter? It's not their fault that it isn't something they can control, but it sure as hell is their fault that they continue to put him and everyone else in that situation.

I understand that it isn't your nephew's fault, but the parents can stop taking him to other people's pools or just keep him busy outside of the pool.  I'm sorry but I can't help but laugh.

One thing I\u2019ve noticed is that a LOT of Autists want to communicate, they just can\u2019t. This boy may have words in his head that he can\u2019t get out. Yes, every Autist is different and has different abilities but we should ALWAYS practice assumed competence until we\u2019re 100% sure of the opposite. \n\nThe parents say slightly ID, that means he should still be able to communicate in some way and learn to signal for the potty. There are things that they can use to teach him to do that- have they trialed these things? It honestly doesn\u2019t sound like it. These ppl sound like the kind of ppl who talk in a baby voice to the nephew. (Ppl do that to my twins friend that is minimally verbal and it drives my girls INSANE.
