I was a cashier at a grocery store years ago when cell phones were just becoming a thing. It drive me nuts when people would come through my line on their phones. So I would scan one or two items that didn't cost a lot twice! Well, one day, I was at my register, and the cashier in front of me walked a way for a second to put a basket away. Well, this one customer was on her phone talking away. She emptied out her basket onto my conveyer belt. She turns around and puts the basket right where the other cashier is supposed to stand.

Reminds me of the time I had to fill up my tank on the way to work. It was 5.45am and I wasn't in the greatest mood. Got to the petrol station and realised that there were only two pumps free. Only one of the two worked, so I parked my car and began filling my tank. A few minutes later this woman in a large expensive car pulls up behind me and starts rudely honking at me. I turn around and am about the explain that the pump in front of me is out of service when she rolls down her window and starts scolding me. Calls me rude and stupid for not using the pump in front. Decided then and there that I'd just ignore her. She got mad, stopped honking and tried to squeeze past me, cursing all the while. Just calmly watched her manouver her car while finishing up. Got the satisfaction of seeing her face fall while I drove away slowly, as she read the \"out of service\" notice on the pump when she got out of her car. It still warms my heart whenever I think about it.", "Lol and then maybe hang behind after to comment on her items?", "Oh no! I seem to have a mystery allergy to a product in one of these containers!
