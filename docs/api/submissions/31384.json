My partner and I were invited to a friends place for a thanksgiving dinner. We had asked if we could bring anything and he said no, he\u2019s got it covered. We were invited for 1pm, at about 3pm he stated he would get started on the turkey, which would take at least 4 hours. We had some drinks but he had no other food available. At about 6pm we were starving and our friend kept pushing back the time for dinner. As mentioned previously, he didn\u2019t have any other food available and since we had drank for a while we started feeling not so great and started just wanting to get home. At around 7, because the food was still somehow going to be at least another hour, we left. We felt bad for leaving but there were at least about 10 other people that stayed. \n\nAnyways, the following day our friend texted us asking for $55 each to cover the drinks and food. We had about three drinks each, and no food, so that seemed very ridiculous to us, and no thanksgiving dinner would cost $550+! He also hadn\u2019t mentioned charging us before, even when we asked if we could bring anything. What\u2019s even worse, the following day he took all the leftover food to work to share with his coworkers (who obviously didn\u2019t need to pay anything)! So basically, he charged us for his invitation and wanted us to pay for everyone else\u2019s food without us having any. \n\nSo far, we have haven\u2019t send the money because we\u2019re not sure what to do. We\u2019d be willing to pay for the drinks, but even then, if you host something you shouldn\u2019t be able to ask for money later if it wasn\u2019t previously discussed. Another friend who was there asked him for an itemized list of the costs, but he hasn\u2019t send it yet. \n\nAre we the assholes for not paying the $55?", "created_utc": 1700525117, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1803bbx/aita_for_being_invited_to_a_friendsgiving_dinner/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And your friend is a terrible host.  Both from an etiquette standpoint (the whole asking for money thing is *extremely* tacky) and from a logistical standpoint.  Who invites guest to arrive **6 hours** before the main meal and doesn't provide nibbles in the meantime?!?  There's no way I'd accept an invite from them again, even if they've hopefully now learned how long it takes to cook a turkey.", "NTA. What a nightmare!\n\nYour friend is an awful host, and should be aware they're in way over their head before asking people over for a food-based holiday. They should have welcomed other people bringing food, and maybe it wouldn't have taken 7+ hours to make dinner.\n\nAlso, completely separate, it is really horrible to charge people money for dinner at your house. The only way I can even see this being a thing is if it's discussed beforehand, and everyone accepts the invitation with this information at the beginning. Even then, it's not a good idea because when someone throws a party and offers to host, they are implying they'll cover the cost of food. People don't even get charged to eat at weddings! Let alone a home cooked meal.\n\nLastly, you didn't even eat dinner! This person is not a friend to you. If you want to burn the bridge, tell them how gauche they are. If you want to leave this door open, get them a few beers to replace what you drank and let them apologize. Do NOT pay them the money they asked for after the fact.\n\nEdited for clarity.", "Did they think that turkey would take an hour, I would have bounced when he said he was just starting the bird. NTA", "NTA.  Average cost of a full Thanksgiving dinner for 4 is $61.  Oh, but you didn't eat anything.  So that would put your share at.....$0.  Tell your friends you didn't eat, so you're not paying.", "NTA, you arrived expecting food, you only got drinks", "NTA\n\nTell him to get as stuffed as the turkey you never tasted.", "Tell him you\u2019ll return the favor and have him over for 10 hours with 3 drinks and no food next Saturday. Then you\u2019ll be square.", "NTA\u2026\u201dDude, you invited us to your home at 1 pm for dinner and then did not even start cooking it until hours later.  You had no other food available during that time either.  At 7pm, we left because we could no longer wait for something to eat! Six hours after you said we would have dinner!  You never said anything about cost when extending an invite and said no when we offered to bring something.  Sorry bro, there is no way we are paying 110 dollars for food we never even saw.  And we would like to know exactly what food we could have possibly even have eaten that would cost 55 a person?\u201d", "NTA and who starts the turkey after the guests arrive that takes hours, counter send a bill for time wasted at a day you could have a really good dinner", "Surely he is taking the pee!   . Has he never been anywhere to any party?    Every one knows you do snacks and nibbles. Not being American I've never cooked a Turkey, but those huge  things take hours from what I gather.  \nJust ignore.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You also don't get to charge people after the fact.  If he asks again ask him to send the documentation (text, email, social media) where he told you what the cost would be and you agreed to pay it.", "Where i live $55 is a thanksgiving dinner for 5 at the grocery store all made up, just heat and eat.", "NTA. First, he should have been upfront about charging. That\u2019s scummy all on its own. I say pay nothing because it\u2019s ridiculous to keep so many people waiting for food. That\u2019s borderline cruel.   \n\n\nAnd cross off the friend cause he isn\u2019t one.", "Jeez - NTA - you need better, newer friends who truly know what Friendsgiving means.  You don't leave your guests with ZERO FOOD for 5 hours.  \n\nI personally would tell the host where his in-actions would land his text request for $$$!!!  But that is just me!!", "NTA- you didn't get to even eat dinner. It wasn't discussed prior to the invite that there was a charge for attending. Your \"friend\" is not a very good one.", "NTA ,\n\nneed new friend\n\nbased on the description its more like $700+ which is more like...a modest restaurant meal + drinks", "Is this friendship important to you?\n\nIf yes.....send the money and call it a day.\n\nIf not....rightly point out you were not told in advance and did not eat.\n\nEither way.....bring a few granola bars if you ever go over there again.", "NTA. That's not a friend, dump them.", "NTA, a dinner invite shouldn\u2019t come with hidden fees especially not a Friendsgiving. It\u2019s also weird to wait to start cooking until after the guests have been there for 2 hours.", "NTA. The host is. Return the Favor. Invite him over for dinner. But actually provide him dinner.  Then say you\u2019re more than even.", "NTA you can't give people drinks and then tell them afterwards that they owe you money for it, that's ridiculous.  Let alone $110!!  This friend is bonkers.", "NTA. You do not charge guests for food, generally. If someone wants to deviate from that societal norm, they have to make is completely clear in advance, and they have to make it completely clear how much their guests will be charged. For $55, I would be expecting a really fancy dinner, not a turkey dinner from someone who has no idea how to prepare one.", "NTA. \n\nDude can pound sand. \n\nI question the IQ (and EQ) of a person who\u2019d try to run an unannounced after-the-fact collection scam after *not* feeding you. \n\nHe FAFO.", "NTA.  Are you sure this is a friend, because it doesn't sound like it.  Don't pay him.", "NTA at all. When you're invited to dinner, you expect to actually eat. Not sit there for hours offered only drinks and nothing else. Plus charging for Thanksgiving dinner?? Seriously? This isn't the sort of friend I'd keep around.", "NTA but your friend definitely is.", "NTA  \nI wouldn't pay anything. I'd also mention that I didn't eat and only had two drinks, and that if he's charging, he should have said something before. Hard no.", "NTA who invites people for dinner and makes them wait 6 hours without snacks? I\u2019d send back a laughing emoji then ignore him if he asks for money again", "NTA. He invited you and offered to host. That assumes he's providing the food and paying for it. You offered to bring something and he said he's got it covered. Again, that implies that he's providing the food (i.e., paying for it as hosts do). \n\nIf he wants to charge people for food and beverages, he has to say that upfront. Also, you didn't get dinner! I would not pay but would also not socialize with a person like this. If you want to compromise, you could sent him $10 for the drinks.", "NTA by a long shot. But you now must choose: pay to keep the peace, or don\u2019t pay and start a war. Either way this friendship seems over to me.", "NTA. Don't pay a cent. It's not like he can sue you! He is trying to use you to cover up for his incompetence.  \nAlso, I recommend that you stop calling him a \"friend\". :)", "I tend to agree with this statement", "Also, send him back a bill for the hours of both your time he wasted!
