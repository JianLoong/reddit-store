Even if it sucked or wasn't \"objectively\" good, it's entirely the thought that counts and that's what's worth it.

But lots of people don't feel gratitude for things they don't really want or won't use. I know how fine a line we're walking when we gift people. I always try to buy or make things I hope the receiver will use and really enjoy. But, again, I know that some people feel comfortable expressing their feelings about a gift and you lose the idea that no one is owed a gift in the first place.\n\nPersonally, I was taught that the only appropriate response to receiving a gift is a well meant *\"Thank you!\"* But at least half the people don't subscribe to that.  \ud83e\udd23\n\nSo, NTA. I'm sorry he hurt your feelings. Being rude never improves a communication, IMO. And that's where he missed the mark telling you that you wasted your money. He doubled down on being rude when he told you that you overreacted to his rudeness. And back to the drawing board next year unless you just want to ask him what he wants for Christmas?", "This is a hard one. My question is what was your intention behind the gift? Was it bc you saw it on tik tok and wanted to do a trend  or because you thought he'd actually like and use the items? The only thing that makes him an AH is the comment about the gift card not having enough,  that's Rude and ungrateful,  but letting you know he doesn't like the other stuff is something He's allowed to do and doesn't make him ungrateful thats his way of letting you know in the future he doesn't like that stuff.", "NTA  - \"Thank you for the present\" is grateful.  \"Thank you for the present, I hate it\" is ungrateful.", "NTA\n\nIs he 16? Even a 16 year old should know that the way to handle a gift you don't really want is to still say thank you and appreciate the thought. If one doesn't like it enough, gift receipts come in handy.\n\nThis is always a risk in gift-giving. And he responded in a self-involved asshole way.", "How old is this guy?

You got him a nice and thoughtful gift, which he basically threw it back in your face, and then went straight back to playing his game and has the audacity to be mad at you?? If I'd been in your shoes, I would've taken the gifts away with me while he was distracted playing games. Might've left the Xbox card since I don't have one, but I love me a good blanket, candle, etc. Sorry you put all that effort in to do something nice and didn't get any thanks for it.", "Are you sure this is your person?

The point is to get him things that he would enjoy or use.

The comment about the gift card not having enough money on it makes him sound like a gold-digger. It\u2019s also an absurd comment if you know anything about gaming. Any amount of money can be used towards a purchase, there\u2019s no minimum amount that\u2019s useful. Honestly I\u2019d take the basket back and keep it for when you find a guy worthy of receiving it.", "NTA. Your boyfriend should have appreciated the thought and effort you put into the gift. It's not about the material items, it's about the gesture. His response was very ungrateful.", "Take the entire thing back.  All of it", "NTA take back the gift and ditch him.

What a bitter grouchy man.", "I'd be well chuffed if I got a random gift like that I wasn't expecting.

Get rid of this prick.", "Nta dont get him an xmas gift", "NTA \n\nI sat here and thought about this for a minute because I found this one to be surprisingly difficult.\n\nI thought that it sounds like you bought him things that YOU would like to receive as a gift - a basket, candy, candle, clothes, body wash, blanket. These aren\u2019t things that any of my previous boyfriends or my husband would want or ask for as young men but as a younger woman also made the mistake of buying clearly not understanding. The Xbox card was tight, but your gift doesn\u2019t sound very personal or tailored to your man.\n\nBut his reaction was SUPER LAME. \nThe blanket. Wasn\u2019t. Soft\u2026enough? Is he made of tissue paper? It probably needs to be washed, what a dolt. WHO SAYS THAT? Just smile a lot and say \u201cwow thank you! This candle will always remind me of you, now help me eat this candy!\u201d. He needs to learn some manners, geez! I\u2019m sorry, OP!", "\ud83d\udea9", "Ew. Leave this guy lol.

Why on earth would I want to exchange gifts with anyone who has no regard for my feelings. I'd rather skip gifting and save my money. This is called The A Hole Tax. You will always be taxed when you show me your azz.\"", "a little bit of both. i wanted to get him something, and this trend kind of gave me a cute reason to. i didn\u2019t record or post it or anything so it\u2019s not like i really added to the trend", "Yes that\u2019s what I was thinking. It\u2019s a really big present to give someone out of the blue. It\u2019s a bit too big to a spontaneous romantic gesture. I wonder too if he was thrown by it. His reaction was shitty in any case.", "Not hard at all, the dude was an AH. Are you secretly the boyfriend or something? \nThere are better ways at going about situations like this and he acted like an ungrateful spoilt child - your comment sucks. He was completely in the wrong", "She said in another comment that she did not record a video, just got the idea from Tik Tok", "The first part of your statement I agree with. But he definitely wasn't polite about it, like at all", "It wasn't thoughtful at all.\n\nthe people on Tiktok did the thinking for her. she's just following a trend.", "I wonder what he buys for OP on birthdays and holidays.", "I'd absolutely say you were an asshole if you just gave it to him so you could record a stupid tiktok video. As long as you didn't record it and also didn't mention that you bought the stuff for him because of a tiktok trend, you're probably fine. If you said it was because of the trend and/or just bought whatever you saw in the other videos, it makes the whole thing seem extremely disingenuous.", "Then ESH. You didn't get him a gift because you wanted to, you got him a gift because you saw a trend on tiktok and expected him to react a certain way when you yourself weren't actually being genuine. It wasn't even a thoughtful gift, it was inspired by a trend. Just refrain from gift giving unless it's genuine.", "No I'm not the boyfriend lol I'm a female. He's not wrong for telling her he didn't like certain aspects of  the gifts. Sure his timing was way off , and I stated he was the AH for the Xbox comment  but that doesn't mean he's not allowed to tell her he doesn't like the other gifts ? Not sure why you feel you need to argue with me  that's he's the AH when I made it clear I didn't think he was. If my comment bothers you then keep scrolling.", "I really want the otherside of this story. I had an ex who was super ungrateful unless you got him the best of the best, so it's not like I don't believe he's just an ass. I think ESH. How could you expect someone to react a certain way when you didn't even gift because you thought he might like these things? She literally caught onto a trend and decided to jump in on it. I wonder if he picked up on it and thats why he reacted so shitty, cause tbh, I don't know if I'd be grateful for a gift that wasn't truly thoughtful. It's not really thoughtful when *tiktok* gave you the idea.", "Maybe the idea behind the basket was something she saw on TIK TOK, but maybe the items were her ideas? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nEither way making comments like \"the card didn\u2019t have enough money on it\" \"I don\u2019t like this candy\" (when he loved it previously) etc\u2026 is petty rude.", "You definitely did not read her comment right. She said she already wanted to get him a gift. Gift giving can be hard, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad to be inspired by a trend on TikTok. Trends are trends for a reason.", "did you even read her comment lmfao", "Wrong. Even if it was inspired by a trend, the gesture is still there and she was trying to do something fun and nice. She didn\u2019t even film it. And she likely wasn\u2019t expecting an over the top reaction, but to nitpick everything then get on with the game was downright rude.", "Who cares if it was a trend? If being incredibly hot and having correct opinions on everything was a trend on TikTok, I'd still stay as I am. \n\nAnd yes he's not allowed to say he doesn't like the gifts, that's incredibly rude.", "I want to know how much was in the gift card, like is it enough to buy anything worthwhile or did OP know he was planning to get a certain game or upgrade and the amount isn\u2019t what enough\u2026 \n\nDoes OP know he has a blanket preference. My husband has learned that I prefer to buy any clothing, blankets, etc myself unless I have felt it and let him know exactly which brand or item to get. \n\nMy husband and I are particular about candle scents, he hates fruit scents and I hate baked good/food scents. Does he have certain scents he doesn\u2019t like or just really doesn\u2019t like this one? Some candles are disgusting and gross.\n\nWith the candy, when was the last time OP saw him actually eat the candy? People\u2019s taste preferences can change over time.\n\nI want to know how he said his comments. Was he rude and snarky? Or distracted with his game? Or did he calmly tell her because he knew he wouldn\u2019t use any of it and she had spent money for no reason. \n\nHe probably could have been kinder (since we don\u2019t know his exact wording and tone), but it sucks to have to be grateful for gifts you weren\u2019t expecting and don\u2019t want. I also wonder if he might feel obligated to reciprocate since the figgy was out of normal holidays and the whole situation feels weird to him.", "But you have to know your audience.\n\nWas this even something her boyfriend would appreciate?", "I read her comment right. If she wanted to get a gift then get him something he wants? Not because a bunch of other people are doing it on tiktok, only to get offended that he wasn't like omg babe thanks I always wanted a blanket that I could've gotten myself. You're not owed gratitude just because you gave something that person didn't ask for.", "He 100% has the right to tell her he doesn't like the gifts she's his partner and he's allowed to communicate that to her wtf ??? Telling him he can't tell her he doesn't like gifts is incredibly toxic. Being able to communicate with your partner is incredibly important for Long term relationships.", "Did she not get him an Xbox card? Didn\u2019t she say he was playing video games? Sounds like that was something he would definitely be interested in, but he was still ungrateful.\n\nDo you not use sweatshirts and blankets for the winter? Those items are things basically everyone needs for winter and it would be very convenient to get them as gifts.\n\nRandom gift giving that shows you were thinking of your partner is a part of a lot of people\u2019s relationships. She showed him she was thinking about him and cared for him. I think that fact itself would make most people happy.", "Again, getting someone something they didn't ask for just because you saw the trend doesn't mean that person has to respond the way you want them to. She got him an Xbox card but for all we know she put $10 on it, so yeah that definitely wouldn't be enough.\n\nI can get myself blankets and sweatshirts, in fact, that's something most people get themselves. If someone gave me a blanket as a gift I'd be weirded out too, especially if they never even asked if I wanted one or what type I like.\n\n>She showed him she was thinking about him and cared for him\n\nNo, she showed that she can't ask a man what he's interested in and she gets gift ideas based purely on what's trendy on tiktok. \n\n>I think that fact itself would make most people happy.\n\nYeah, if it was a gift you actually wanted or liked. She doesn't even say if he likes candles... not everyone does. I don't like anything with scents or smells, most of it doesn't smell as good as others think. She brought him something *she* thought was nice and got shocked he didn't like it."]}
