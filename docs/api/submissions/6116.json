My female cousin (Sandra) and I (both 30s) aren't close. My sister and mom adore though and think that she's a perfect role model in everything she does. I tend to disagree but won't expand on that. I try to stay civil and we only meet during big family events.\n\n\nThe family got together on christmas and an accident took place. We were all standing outside and Sandra didn't pay attention to the stair and tripped and almost fell, but she, instead of grabbing her husband's arm, grabbed my husband's to stop herself from falling. I found that inappropriate and deliberate.Also, I'm sure her husband felt irritated by that as well. She then casually let go of him and went to get some water. I brought it up to her when the women were alone and there was a huge argument. She called me \"ridiculous\" for getting hung up on whose arm she grabbed to prevent herself ftom falling. She said my husband was the closest to her at the time and that it was \"illogical\" for her to \"look\" for her husband's arm. Word from me word from her and we blew up. Mom started scolding me for making a scene during the celebration over a \"nonsensical issue\". My husband said that I overreacted Sandra ended up leaving.\n\n\nMy aunt (Sandra's mom) called me a nasty name and said I shouod be ashamed of indirectly accusing her daughter of being unfaithful and having her eyes on my husband. She said it was an accident but I escalated it and should apologize for the shitty night but I haven't done that as I needed space. Now my parents are pushing me to apologize as to not severe the familia relationship we have with Sandra and aunt.\n\nEdit because I feel like I need to expand more on how it happened. When she tripped, it was my brother standing, then me, then my husband then her. On the other side was her husband and an another family member. Her husband was nearby by but close enough to grab his arm if she wanted in my opinion.", "created_utc": 1672514489, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1001i8q/aita_for_telling_my_female_cousin_that_she/", "score": 660, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I fell forward and accidentally grab our male friend on his upper thigh. It wasn\u2019t personal, it\u2019s where my hand landed. I\u2019m still mortified a decade later.", "YTA! Bro it was either grabbing your husband, who is a human person by the way, or your cousin falling down the stairs and possibly injuring herself severely. Your husband wont fuck your cousin just because she used his arm to prevent herself from falling down the stairs.", ">Edit because I feel like I need to expand more on how it happened. When she tripped, it was my brother standing, then me, then my husband then her. On the other side was her husband and an another family member. Her husband was nearby by but close enough to grab his arm if she wanted in my opinion.\n\nOK. Grabbing onto something when you're falling is still a reflex and as such doesn't involve conscious thought and decision. Your belief that she was in control of who she grabbed onto is utterly *absurd.* YTA.", "YTA.  She reached for the closest thing to prevent her fall.\nIf I were falling down the stairs and your husband's erect dick was the closest thing to grab then that'd be the thing that prevents me from falling.", "YTA. I think she was trying to avoid being hurt and was absolutely not thinking about you. I realize this seems to pain you... maybe you should talk to a professional about that.", "YTA and jealousy is an ugly color hun. Most of the time jealousy is a sign that you need to do some inner work and figure out what about her threatens your ego. Other women aren\u2019t your enemy, they should be your tribe. And if she\u2019s not rude to you or mean then make her your friend and apologize to her.", "YTA, especially with your helpful edit. \n\nYou admit that your husband was right next to her and she would have had to reach past him *and* you in order to grab onto her own husband's arm. That's absurd. When someone is falling they're going to naturally reach out to the nearest thing or person that will steady them. They're not going to stop to analyze whether the person they're grabbing has an insanely insecure spouse who will start some drama over an imagined precursor to infidelity.\n\nYou come across as super insecure and clearly have trust issues around your cousin and possibly your husband as well.", "What the hell is wrong with you? YTA big time.", "YTA- Wow, you don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re mature enough to be married .  Insecurity and jealousy are never a good look, grow up.", "YTA - sounds like you\u2019re jealous of her all around", "YTA.  Seriously?  Instinct takes over in a situation like that and you grab the closest person.  You're projecting your feelings about her onto her actions.  Nothing she did would have made you happy.", "YTA. Chill the fuck out. You\u2019re a grown woman.", "Girl, you sound like drama and I\u2019d be embarrassed by your behavior. Get over yourself. YTA.", "YTA. Do you disagree with her saying your husband was closer? Was that supposed to be an intimate act because I don't see the issue.", "Your husband doesn\u2019t agree with you.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Stop being so petty and seek therapy for your obsession", "YTA, seek therapy", "YTA. in that situation, what she did was a reflex. If you are so jealous you can\u2019t handle someone accidentally grabbing yyou ur husbands arm when they are falling, you may want to consider therapy to help yourself sort through those emotions.", "YTA. People don't think about what they hold onto to prevent them from falling. An argument over this was an effective and ridiculous way to ruin the holidays.", "YTA and your family members all have their heads on straight.", "YTA - Speak about being insecure if you think your cousin did it on purpose...", "You just sound jealous and like you\u2019re looking for a justification for putting her down, or like a way to get others to view her as badly as you do. She didn\u2019t do anything inappropriate, she grabbed a nearby person while falling and then let go once she wasn\u2019t. I guess by your own logic you better hope you only ever fall when your own spouse is nearby, since you won\u2019t be allowed to grab onto anyone else lol. If you\u2019ve ever grabbed onto someone else you must be a cheater! /s\n\nYTA and you ruined everyone\u2019s holiday on top of acting insecure and jealous.

YTA, by the way.", "YTA. Drama queen much?", "YTA - do you think when someone falls they have time to do a quick inventory of some bizarre etiquette? You grab the nearest thing to.......not fall. You being threatened by that is a major case of you needing to deal with you and stop projecting onto her. You speak about others liking her and clearly you a jealous. Well sadly if this is how you respond to things like this then you need to stop thinking others are the issue and try to be more socially aware.", "YTA. You actually think the human brain processes that amount of information in a nanosecond and then makes both a deliberate and spiteful choice in the face of immediate danger? Get the fuq outta here.", "I want you to walk up the stairs with two different people on either side of you, then slip and see how easy it is for you to ignore your insticts to grab the closest person and turn aroud, while slipping, to grab the person behind you.", "Not even debatable. Massive yta. I hope you fall and your husband lets you", "YTA Have you ever skipped or tripped? Did you pause to consider all your options before you resumed falling?\n\nDid you pick the most desirable option?

You are making issues out of nothing and are clearly jealous and insecure of your cousin. Grow up, act your age and stop causing needless drama.

It was funny and we all had a good laugh even my husband. I don\u2019t see the issue OP with her just grabbing where she could.", "YTA... Big time... Your jealousy and envy have twisted your view of reality. Please seek help.", "YTA. When you fall, who you grab is instinct it\u2019s not conscious thought.", "YTA. I feel like there's some other stuff going on between you and the cousin here. It sounds like potentially unresolved issues. Might be worth exploring what that is......", "Thanks for the edit. It helped to clarify that you're YTA. I was already leaning heavily in that direction and it pushed me over the edge. If only your husband was close by to keep me from falling...", "YTA.

You wanted her to.... stop time in mid slip, look around for the \"appropriate\" arm to grab?  Her husband was not irritated and if he was , he's just as much of an asshole as you are.  If you're going down, and need an arm and my husband or me is standing near you, please feel free to grab our arm so you don't break your wrist, or tail bone.  That hurts alot.

When a person is falling, they don't think \"gee, where is my husband, can i reach for him\". They instinctively reach for the closest person/thing to either stop their fall or break it.
