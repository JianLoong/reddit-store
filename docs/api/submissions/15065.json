{"id": 15065, "submission_id": "12q2627", "title": "AITA for telling a woman off at work", "selftext": "So I work at a 7/11. This one woman came up with her three kids. Her kids got three small Slurpees and one of them got a snickers bar. The total came out to be $6 or something around that. Then she decided to get $50 worth of cigarettes. When I gave her the new total, she was baffled and pretty irritated. She then looked at her kids and started raising her voice at them saying \u201cdo you know how much money I\u2019m spending on you guys today, that\u2019s almost $60 I just wasted on you.\u201d \n\nThe kids looked mildly uncomfortable because their mom is yelling at them in a 7/11 for the items that they got which was less than 10% of the total cost. I decided to speak up and explained that the total is only that much because of the cigarettes, and that the Slurpees are like $1 each. She then snapped at me and told me to not tell her how to raise her kids, which I thought was straight out of a hallmark movie on bad parenting and that irritated me a bit. Cause I had a long day at that point having worked 9 hours already, so I had it. I then said \u201cI\u2019m not trying to tell you how to raise your kids ma\u2019am but its basic math. You spent like fifty bucks on cigarettes and you\u2019re blaming your kids.\u201d \n\nWe went back and forth for a bit and she decided she was never coming back here again. But she also insisted on paying for the cigarettes still, but I put them back and told her to leave. I told them that they could keep the Slurpees but she insisted on throwing them away before they left the store. My coworker told me that I should have stayed in my lane, but I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong. Apparently she left a really bad review on us because of the situation though and I got a meeting with my boss about it soon cause she used my name specifically. \n\nI feel like I was kind of an asshole because I just snapped at her cause I was having a bad day. But I also feel like she was out of line with her kids. So I really gotta ask, AITA!", "created_utc": 1681775427, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12q2627/aita_for_telling_a_woman_off_at_work/", "score": 124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You advocated for those kids. Morally, you're good.", "NTA. Those kids will remember the voice of opposition to their selfish, nasty mother.", "Morally, absolutely NTA.  \nBut unfortunately, it's not good business.   \nUnfortunately in the world we live in, you gotta decide if you can afford to be moral.", "NTA\n\nGood for you standing up for the kids, they will remember this for a long time. \n\nYou\u2019re probably going to lose your job though, unfortunately.

Those poor kids!", "NTA, she was the issue here, but yes may be you should have stay in your lane, just because it's business and acting like that can cause trouble, but still, NTA, you did nothing wrong", "NTA and honestly just tell the boss how negative the woman was being to the kids. If you spoke to her reasonable tone and didn\u2019t like totally lose your cool and throw a fit about it, it shouldn\u2019t be the end of the world. So what if she didn\u2019t buy cigarettes. So what if she threw out the slurpies.  I wouldn\u2019t self deprecate about snapping at her or your bad day either.

Kids don't like to see their mom start fights with employees either, and they have to sit in the car after and hear about it for hours. Another commenter was right - take the slushies off the order and be more subtle about your point to her and the kids. That's all you have to do! But you did too much. Don't get me wrong, if you're a customer somewhere and you overhear something like that you're in the clear to speak up!! But if she treats them like they're expenses you're not going to change that, you're just going to irritate some people that are already super irritable. \n\nSorry but 9 hours for you at that part of the day could be 18 for her or 15 for the guy behind her, people are all in different stages of their day and your job is supposed to complete transactions with customers and keep moving on. You've gotta kill em with kindness behind a counter.\n\nI hope it gets easier for you. I've had coffee thrown on my car, our front door broken by some angry guy, I really do get it. But I did grow out of taking it out on customers, even when I'm stressed and tired and angry and I know they're wrong. It's just too small of a matter to get so worked up on especially for that wage. Trashy people do trashy things and live comfortably, you have to accept it or you'll always be pissed off. Best wishes!!", "NTA. But no good deed and allathat. Good luck with your meeting.", "As someone who worked at 7/11 I would\u2019ve said oh don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll take the slurpees off!

And is it just me or do people who say things like, don\u2019t tell me how to parent my kids, or, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be a parent, often have no idea how to be a good parent?", "slurpees are cheap af at cost,  it might cost OP their job but they're NTA", "That's true, but as a business manager, it's also hilarious.
