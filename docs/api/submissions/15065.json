Her kids got three small Slurpees and one of them got a snickers bar. The total came out to be $6 or something around that. Then she decided to get $50 worth of cigarettes. When I gave her the new total, she was baffled and pretty irritated. She then looked at her kids and started raising her voice at them saying \u201cdo you know how much money I\u2019m spending on you guys today, that\u2019s almost $60 I just wasted on you.\u201d \n\nThe kids looked mildly uncomfortable because their mom is yelling at them in a 7/11 for the items that they got which was less than 10% of the total cost. I decided to speak up and explained that the total is only that much because of the cigarettes, and that the Slurpees are like $1 each. She then snapped at me and told me to not tell her how to raise her kids, which I thought was straight out of a hallmark movie on bad parenting and that irritated me a bit. Cause I had a long day at that point having worked 9 hours already, so I had it. I then said \u201cI\u2019m not trying to tell you how to raise your kids ma\u2019am but its basic math. You spent like fifty bucks on cigarettes and you\u2019re blaming your kids.\u201d \n\nWe went back and forth for a bit and she decided she was never coming back here again. But she also insisted on paying for the cigarettes still, but I put them back and told her to leave. I told them that they could keep the Slurpees but she insisted on throwing them away before they left the store. My coworker told me that I should have stayed in my lane, but I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong. Apparently she left a really bad review on us because of the situation though and I got a meeting with my boss about it soon cause she used my name specifically. \n\nI feel like I was kind of an asshole because I just snapped at her cause I was having a bad day. But I also feel like she was out of line with her kids. So I really gotta ask, AITA!", "created_utc": 1681775427, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12q2627/aita_for_telling_a_woman_off_at_work/", "score": 539, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you spoke to her reasonable tone and didn\u2019t like totally lose your cool and throw a fit about it, it shouldn\u2019t be the end of the world. So what if she didn\u2019t buy cigarettes.

Kids don't like to see their mom start fights with employees either, and they have to sit in the car after and hear about it for hours. Another commenter was right - take the slushies off the order and be more subtle about your point to her and the kids. That's all you have to do! But you did too much. Don't get me wrong, if you're a customer somewhere and you overhear something like that you're in the clear to speak up!! But if she treats them like they're expenses you're not going to change that, you're just going to irritate some people that are already super irritable. \n\nSorry but 9 hours for you at that part of the day could be 18 for her or 15 for the guy behind her, people are all in different stages of their day and your job is supposed to complete transactions with customers and keep moving on. You've gotta kill em with kindness behind a counter.\n\nI hope it gets easier for you. I've had coffee thrown on my car, our front door broken by some angry guy, I really do get it. But I did grow out of taking it out on customers, even when I'm stressed and tired and angry and I know they're wrong. It's just too small of a matter to get so worked up on especially for that wage.

From one retail worker to the next. I would lie to your boss. Tell them she was upset about the total so you kindly and patiently tried to explain why it cost how much it did.

Don't take their termination or maybe write up as something bad about you as a person. You did great. You stood up for some kids. Definitely a good person in my book.", "Definitely NTA and if you lose your job over this all I hope for is that the good karma from this lands you an even better opportunity. It\u2019s sad that the mother was making them feel like a burden for something so minor while indulging in herself with 50 dollars worth of cigarettes.", "NTA Customer just didn't like the truth lol", "Agreed! I feel bad for those kids", "> Good for you standing up for the kids, they will remember this for a long time. \n\ngood odds they don't remember it positively. she already forced the kids to throw their slurpees out, so they were already punished by this interaction. the odds that she took it out on them in other ways after leaving the store is pretty dang high\n\nin a mild scenario, she just blames them for your behaviour and yells at them. or next time they want slurpees, she says no, yells at them, etc. in a more extreme scenario she punishes them more severely, or hits them\n\nmost common variations of this are that the kids are too blame for being \"disrespectful\", or embarrassing her, or causing a scene\n\nyeah /u/boltsoffury10, you stood up for the kids, but didn't actually accomplish anything for them except winding up their mom who you already know blames them for things unfairly.... so who do you think she's taking that anger at on? yeah it's her kids, or someone else who she has power over\n\nher kids probably already knew that her complaining about spending money on them was a lie, and if not, it's something they'll figure out fairly soon\n\nI get your instincts here, but if you're going to try and be kind and help a child who has an abusive parent, you really really don't want to escalate things with their parent and then leave them alone with that parent\n\nNTA to the mom, but yeah you were an unintentional AH to the kids", "I disagree. \n\nI was the kid in a similar experience. I was in elementary school, and I had a similar experience with my BPD mom in a 7-11. I didn\u2019t fully understand what was happening at the time as I felt embarrassed and scared, but I knew my mom\u2019s behavior wasn\u2019t right. \n\nThat moment was so validating for me as a young person! \n\nIt\u2019s also been hugely validating as an adult too. Also a great point of reference from which to heal", "Just to clarify I DO ARGEE about not pissing off an abuser who will likely take it out on the victim.", "My mother probably would have slaughtered me in the back for being made to look like a lying moron by someone lmao\n\nI definitely would have been laughing at her internally though and remembered it in a positive light until the latter portion.", "Customer isn't always right, and I bet you're just so heartbroken that she won't be back.  NTA.", "NTA. And just lie to your boss about what happened.", "NTA. I hope the kids remember you when the mother is off on a tangent of everything being their fault. Shame on people like that. \n\n\nJust play dumb unless they show you a recording with sound. And even then, emotional distress.", "NTA; as someone with a selfish parent the best moment in my childhood was watching a stranger call them out for their crap.", "NTA. Is it worth your job? I don't know your life, but it definitely was a good thing to stand up for those kids.", "From a retail perspective very slight A-hole..(like maybe 2%) because you kinda stuck your nose into another person's personal choice....however\n\n\nNTA and a bit of hero. You put things in perspective and probably saved those kids 50 packs worth of second hand smoke..\n\nYou bow to no-one", "The *anger* I felt reading this. It\u2019s so on point. Brb I need to scream into a pillow then cuddle my dog now.", "At the very least, they got to experience an outsider signaling to them that their mom isn't being good and normal, that they don't deserve to be treated this way. So many kids believe they must deserve the abuse they get, maybe this moment planted a seed in their minds that they don't deserve bad treatment and even that other adults may want to help them.", "yeah it's absolutely wonderful to have your experience validated. there are also other ways to try and do that that don't risk consequences to the child in question\n\nas with all DV situations, if you're not the one at risk it's not your risk to take\n\nis validation worth the kids getting told they don't get dinner that night? or getting screamed at for hours? or getting grounded for weeks? honestly it might be for some kids but you have no way of knowing, hell you have no way of even knowing the potential consequences\n\ninstead you can try and catch the kids eye and give them a reassuring or comforting glance. if you have a second with them away from their parents you can say something then\n\nbut standing up to a parent on behalf of their minor child, when that parent is exhibiting major red flag behaviour is risking putting that kid in a world of hurt with their parents later\n\nultimately you need to consider who you are to this kid and how much you can actually help them, and how much their parents can hurt them. if it's a single interaction and their parents are right there, there is not a whole lot you can do that isn't risky\n\nand if your only options are risky ones, you have to hope that the other people in their life can do better - people who have repeat access and can figure out when to time moments to talk to the kid\n\nthis is a general rule of thumb for anyone in an abusive situation like this - you play it cool, don't make their situation worse, and then look for an opportunity to support them privately, following THEIR lead\n\nI absolutely wish more people would step up, but I've noticed that by and large people are willing to step up if it means confronting someone bad, but not willing to step up in the same way when it's just the victim and the abuser isn't around\n\nif the mom had left to go to the car to grab her wallet, would OP have said something to the kids without mom there? I hope so. but after seeing many a similar situation on here, I have started to suspect that a lot of people are in it for the rush of confronting someone \"bad\" instead of supporting someone who needs it. and OPs comments about their own headspace make it sound like this wasn't really about the kids. same with coming to AITA after, they're asking about the mom, not the kids (even though they saw the kids face at least one consequence as a result of the intervention)", "NTA, not all heroes wear capes.", "NTA - poor kids.", "NTA\nGod bless you and your beautiful soul!", "NTA. What you really did here was stand up for her kids when most likely no one else does. All the money she's spending on cigarettes that could go towards her kids, that could be clothes, toys, food, savings, college money. We all know cigarettes cause cancer, it's a fact, so she'll also be robbing her children of their mother much earlier than most if she continues. And with that grade a parenting I'm sure she's smoking around them. My cousin died from cancer from second hand smoke growing up in a smoking household, it's definitely a real thing. How someone could blame their children for their smoking addiction is just gross. The little moments where adults stand up for them, those children will remember and treasure. You saw them not as annoyances but as worthy humans and they clearly don't get that from their mom. The customer isn't always right. We've ingrained that they are always right into our society and it's created monsters that act horribly in front of and directly to service workers.", "NTA but was it really worth risking your job for strangers?", "NTA- you could have just \u2018honestly\u2019 been giving her a gentle correction. What kind of employee would you be if you let her leave thinking slurpees cost $50? Imagine the review she would have left about price gouging. \nAt least- that\u2019s what you should tell your boss.", "NTA. Even though the kids lost their slushies it\u2019s good for them to hear from someone else that their mother\u2019s priorities are not ok. They will likely know this already but to have the validation from a sensible adult is important. I hope she thinks about her priorities and the way she speaks to her kids better in future.", "You're a person before you're a worker\n\nEveryone should stand up to mistreatment of children.\n\nNTA", "It's really not at risk. They'll call the complaint line, it'll go to the district which will email the store manager or franchisee, and they might get a talking to. If they can even find the complaint line number. \n\nNTA OP. I hate when people do that to shit to their kids.", "Excuse his behavior? Wut.", "Worth it. Op can work at any one of the other 57000 gas stations within 2 miles.", "I hope the kids don\u2019t have to breathe around their mother\u2019s cancer sticks."]}
