She got him in trouble for ***the disrespectful way he spoke to her.*** \n\nYTA\n\nIt's not clear the teacher was bullying your child. All she did was try to encourage him to participate in the talent show, which is something a good teacher should do! I'm not sure what you mean when she \"kept badgering\" him. You mean she asked him multiple times then and there? Or she asked him over a few days? Was she mean about it? (INFO)\n\nIt honestly sounded like the teacher was just overenthusiastic and unknowingly annoyed your son. I worked with kids for many years, they're often shy! A lot of them actually *want* to perform, go to the blackboard, etc. when asked, but they say no due to lack of confidence. Teachers are supposed to encourage students to come out of their shell, they wouldn't be doing their job if they didn't.\n\nYes, boundaries are important. And yes, if your son ultimately decided not to perform, that should be respected. But it honestly sounds like your teacher misread the situation. She was probably thinking: \"Oh he clearly likes to perform on the promenade! Maybe with a little encouragement, he'll feel comfortable sharing his talents with his classmates. :)\"\n\nThat's hardly a bully! She misread the situation, she didn't target your kid on purpose.\n\nAnd your son *snapped* that \"***he didn't want to be a part of her stupid dumb show***\"?! That was SO uncalled for from an 11 year old. How does an 11 year old become comfortable speaking to their teacher that way?? 11-year-old me would NEVER. And I had no problems standing up for myself at that age.\n\nYou should be teaching him to be polite, even when he's being firm about his needs.

You called it as you saw it. She asked and your son not only said no but also gave a reason, which he didn\u2019t have to do. She then kept pushing it. In the adult world, that would probably count as some form of harassment.\n\nAlso, I can see where your son is coming from. He has to go to school with these kids day in and day out. He knows what they\u2019re like and made a judgment about not wanting them possibly ruining his hobby/something he enjoys.", "NTA- NO MEANS NO. End of story.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m surprised by how many people don\u2019t see this as a form of bullying. Maybe subconsciously some people don\u2019t think a child has the right to be autonomous in any situation. While there are plenty of things a child can\u2019t have the final decision in, we should be teaching kids that there are times it\u2019s good to say no to adults \n\nIf this has taken place between two adults at a workplace, one in a position of authority, I think there would be less question as to if it was bullying. \n\n\nLike if a supervisor constantly badgered an employee to participate in a talent show, and then, after politely declining numerous times on different days, the employee eventually was like \u201cstop asking I don\u2019t want to be in the dumb talent show!\u201d And after that the supervisor tried to get the employee in trouble for their response? \n\nI googled the definition of bullying:\n\n\u201cseek to harm, intimidate, or coerce (someone perceived as vulnerable).\u201d\n\nShe, an adult in a position of power, wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer when an 11 year old didn\u2019t want to participate in a voluntary activity. \n\nAnd she didn\u2019t do it bc she thought it would be good for him. She did it because she needed more participants for her talent show. \n\nI don\u2019t think the teacher did it maliciously. She was stressed and I\u2019m sure organizing the talent show doesn\u2019t give her extra salary.  But just cause it wasn\u2019t done maliciously doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t wrong. \n\nAnd when confronted the teacher tried to justify her behavior.

Why normalize and encourage kids to behave with such unnecessary aggression like that? \n\nI'm clearly in the minority here, but I think it's really lousy to teach children to act like this.

Cave and just do it to avoid drama?", "He wouldn't have been disrespectful if the teacher hadn't been harassing him.   If she had asked, and he said no, and she accepted that, he would not have been frustrated enough to use some incredibly mild language. \n\nThe teacher is full on an AH, and the mom is NTA for defending her child. The teacher was bullying the kid, & then tried to weaponize the child's very understandable frustration w/the situation.", "Why should the kid respect somebody who disrespects them? Because the teacher is older?", "Agreed. Our society is becoming full of people who are completely lacking even very basic social skills, and it's really lousy for OP to encourage her young son to behave like this. There are far better ways to communicate with others beyond lashing out and yelling when you become frustrated. \n\nWas the teacher being a bit of a pest? Sounds like it. But that doesn't give OP the green light to be overly confrontational and resort to name calling, making the teacher actually cry. That was totally unnecessary.", "She deserved it you can't bully someone and then get mad when they push back", "He's an 11 yr old; they aren't known for their emotional maturity. Once he said no and gave a good reason, and she kept pushing, she became an AH. If this was in school where she is basically a temporary guardian it would be one thing, but in that situation she's just another stranger, a stranger who won't take no for an answer from a child.", "Anyone who harasses people must pay the consequences.", "Kids aren\u2019t born with social skills, they are taught social skills. OP handled this situation by name-calling and making another adult actually *cry.* And, in another comment, OP brags that if the teacher had been one of her son\u2019s peers, the boy would have simply told them to \u201cfuck off.\u201d\n\nDo you think those are good social skills to teach a kid?", "It can also build lifelong resentment of activities and I would assume being ridiculed by classmates is also a contributing factor to people running amok at schools.", ">What we don't know is the kids response to the teacher.... if he said \"I don't want to be part of your dumb ass show\" (or worse) then noting it in the kids file or giving him a detention could be warranted.\n\nNo. From the sounds of it, he said no politely multiple times. \n\nIf you are a person who repeatedly harasses someone and refuses to take a polite no as an answer, then eventually you are going to provoke your victim into a more forceful pushback. Whatever the kid said in that final reply does not matter. It wasn't his first response. It wasn't the response he wanted to give. It was the response that the teacher forced him to by pushing him until his patience and respect snapped. And he should not be punished for that. He wouldn't have said it if she had not bullied him.", "Yep, I doubt that a teacher would be in tears just because she was asked politely not to keep asking the child to participate", "You would feel mentally unsafe for 40 years because a teacher asked you to perform on stage multiple times and you had to say no multiple times? That's what we're going with?\n\nMost of the comments here are acting like she pushed him on the stage and traumatized him. The assumptions being made are truly mind-boggling.", "Of course not. How about talking to the teacher without resorting to name-calling?", "A bit of?\n\nAn adult consistently badgering an 11 year old is being a bit of? \n\nWhat was her intent if not to break him down to do what she wanted despite his persistent no?\n\nThe boy SNAPPED. Even adults will snap. \n\nHe tells her off one time over a consistent harassment and suddenly he is lacking in basic social skills but the badger was just a \"bit of rude\"\n\nLawd have mercy.", "Don't badger kids into performing and maybe the kid won't snap. The worst word he used was 'dumb' and that wasn't describing her, it was describing the show.", "If someone kept badgering me about something after I had said no repeatedly, I would also tell them to fuck off.", "Do you think harassing children is a good social skill for a teacher?", "Lifelong resentment...? Ok...\n\nSeems extreme. Parents are clearly ok with having \"boomers and millennials throw money at\" their child. But a teacher encouraging his talent is too far. \n\nAlso the end of your comment doesn't make sense. You're not using to run amok correctly", "That's not what it sounded like and the Mom wasn't there... the OP did say \" my son snapped\" and then paraphrased what he told her what he said.  For all we know the kid at school said \"F\\*\\*k off, I'm not being in the f\\*\\*king show you bit\\*h\"", ">Most of the comments here are acting like she pushed him on the stage and traumatized him.\n\n**Because that's what she tried to do**", "How about the teacher not harassing an 11 year old?", "Apparently the boy said no repeatedly and the teacher just ignored him, she seemed to have gotten the message once the kid said the \"horrible, devastating, rude, cruel, inexusable\" words: stupid dumb show.  \nIf anything, the teacher taught him that saying no is not working, he has to resort to another type of language to get through to her.", "The teacher is not encouraging his talent, she needs kids to put on the stage.", "So, you\u2019re saying there\u2019s no other possible way to handle this situation without resorting to name-calling and being hostile?", "The harassed 11 year old was hostile? Alright then...He said no, reasonably polite I would assume, repeatedly and that did not work. He can not really leave the situation because he has to go to school and cannot just leave. He could go to the principal and complain about his teacher harassing him but I think that puts quite a bit of responsibility on the child to defuse a situation that an adult created.", "No, OP was hostile. I mean, she made another adult actually *cry,* so that\u2019s pretty telling. \n\nIn another comment, OP brags that if the teacher had been her son\u2019s peer, the boy would have simply told them to \u201cfuck off,\u201d so that\u2019s pretty telling, too. Do you think it\u2019s good to encourage kids to have such confrontational attitudes like this? So they can grow into adults with confrontational attitudes like this? \n\nI don\u2019t, but maybe you do.", "Or maybe the other adult can only be tough when harassing a child but is a crybaby when being called out by an adult?  \nYou are still not saying what your alternative plan is. If you are saying \"no\" politely 20 times and nothing happens and for whatever reason you cannot leave the situation, what would you do? Say \"no\" politely another 50 times?"]}
