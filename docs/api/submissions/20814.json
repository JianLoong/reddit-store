I am a former martial arts instructor that has dealt with this from a US-centric perspective. Multiple schools I've taught at have basically had the generalized policy of \"look, this is a contact sport, this is a mixed-gender environment, you can either deal with that or here's your money back.\" \n\nThe reason I ask for your location - you're going to continue to experience this if you continue mixed-gender MA training, and that may not be conducive to whatever your goal is. Are you going to refuse female refs, as they may need to touch you to break contact during a match? \n\nI worked for a Muslim individual - to adapt a Dave Chapelle quote, he was 80% TKD guy, 20% Muslim. We had students refuse to bow to female instructors, parents would complain about mixed gender classes, owner of the dojo basically told them they could get a refund and leave, or keep quiet about it and keep training. \n\nEveryone has their own line wrt religious beliefs vs participation in certain activities. For me personally, as someone that spent 20+ years in the martial arts world, I see the mat as the great equalizer. Everything other than your skills gets left at the door.

I can imagine martial arts, especially.  They want to play the sport they signed up for, and while your excuse was genuine, a lot of other folks may lie about something like that, simply b/c they don't want to spar with a girl (mostly out of insecurity - they don't want to kick/punch a girl or WORSE, \"lose\" to a girl).\n\nReaching out to her outside of the gym situation, identifying your exact religion (orthodox jew?) and explaining the restrictions you abide by... \n\n... but again, she is already facing issues/discriminatory treatment from other athletes.", "NTA\n\nWhilst I don't believe in religion I respect the wishes of those who do as long as they are reasonable.", "NTA.

What happens if many men of your religion joins the class, and there ends up being a few, odd number of women? The women end up being left out. Even if that is not your intention, these types of classes often end up being majority men, not enough women to create their own class, so they have to make do with the mixed gender class. Bottom line is, women can't participate if men refuse to engage with them. As a man, you're in a position of power here, and you're just being completely obtuse about it. \n\nI know you are not trying to hurt women, but this is exactly the type of discrimination that closes off many spaces to women, and why sexism is so ingrained in our society. If men will only work with men, there is no place for women in the group anymore. These types of reasons are why it was SO HARD for women to even get the right to work. It's why there are still so few women in positions of power. \n\nWould you prefer to live in a world where women are generally ostracized in public spaces? Because that is the aggregate result of many people behaving like you. \n\nThere is a way for you to help without breaking your religious rules - please accept the restrictions upon yourself instead of making women feel unwelcome in mixed gender spaces. I am sure there are many men only martial arts clubs/classes. Why not join one of those?

So instead of correcting or teaching proper behavior, there's a restriction. I know exactly which religion you're talking about and I have to ask, why? Why does it matter if you touch a member of the opposite sex? Do you think you'll burn in some mystical place? I get it, you're 16 and you're just following the rules that were given to you but reality doesn't fit the narrative of religion. It just doesn't.

While my religion is not as strict, we do also hold a certain level of respect and boundaries for physical touch between men and women. For instance, my son wrestles, but will forfeit if he is paired with a female in a tournament. Considering there were lots of other choices for her in sparring partners (male and female), you had no obligation to spar with her. If tables had been turned and she refused to spar with you based on any reason, my guess is that you would have felt disappointed, but walked away.

However, freedom of religion is protected by the constitution and if that means you cannot spar with a woman, that's a totally different story. It sounds like there are plenty of people (of both sexes) for both of you to find partners and it shouldn't have been such a big deal.

She can't force you to spar, if you don't want to. \n\nEven your instructor understands this, so I don't understand why that woman can't accept it.   If the woman knew of your religious rules,  maybe she just wants to mess with you.? If she's still bothering you, maybe you can speak to the instructor if she's making you feel uncomfortable.", "NTA\n\nit\u2019s your religious beliefs. sadly so many in society are so disrespectful and ignorant to people\u2019s religion. don\u2019t let it get to you.\n\nshe should have heard you the first time and respected and understood. instead she chose to take it personally and act childish.\n\ncontinue to be respectful and kind to her, and ignore her rude behavior.", "NTA obviously", "NTA.

You have the right to religious freedom. But the girls you meet should not be restricted in their options in life because of your religious freedom. Not sparring with a girl - no problem. Not offering a hand to a random woman who might need support when slipping on the street? Borderline problem. Not being able to work on female patients if you are a doctor, or refusing to hire women at work because you might happen to touch them? Definitely a problem.

Applying that to this situation, women are physically weaker so they won't win a fight that way, but they can effectively defend themselves by utilizing a different set of skills (technique and strategy). Problem is, men don't really have to \"practice\" to be stronger. They just ARE. Women, however, need to learn and practice strategy/technique in order to develop those skills (strengths). It's not automatically innate, like physical strength is for men.\n\nSo that being said, you kind of didn't really answer my question fully...what are your thoughts on being part of that learning/experience process, vs not touching women?

No, because that would be racist/homophobic.  \n\nSame applies to women. Women cannot go to mixed gender gyms and demand that all men leave when they work out due to their trauma.

I do believe that it is a greater one to have the prospect of accidentally touching a female in a way that could make her feel uncomfortable.

Thus she was not discriminated against.\n\nIf you do martial arts you can choose who you do them with, for whatever reason or for no reason at all.

He was polite and kind. He did nothing wrong. \n**What makes you think her feelings are more important than his bodily autonomy?**\n\nAnd ad your last point re: women asking all men to leave - that would be different as in your scenario, the woman in question is growing others to act differently based on her needs. But he didn't ask her to stop excercising or ask her to leave, his **decision was limited to his own body.**\n\nYour whole logic is based on a false premise - that he tried to dictate what she does, when that is not the case at all. He made a decision regarding his own body. That's all. Yes, the religion he follows is sexist per se, but his conduct was respectful, correct and polite.\n\nI think I have a better analogy: imagine you can't eat beef because of your religion and you are offered chicken from one person and beef from another. You tell the beef vendor that while you have no problem with him doing his thing, sadly, your religion does not allow you to eat beef. The vendor is free to eat it and sell it to others, but your preference is chicken and that's what you get.

Her problem is not that she just so desperately desires your touch. She is upset and uncomfortable that she joined a mixed gender class, and you are refusing to spar BASED ON HER GENDER. She probably faces this issue on the reg.\n\n\nWhich is why it's respectful to just say \"no thank you\" the way you would if a man asked to spar and you didn't want to.

Something as simple as leaving religion and gender out of your explanation would be a huge sign of respect.\n\n\nFor example, I recently had a cashier ask me for my number. I'm single, and if he had been more attractive I might have given it to him. I could have said \"no thanks, you're fat and ugly, I would never\".
