I am a former martial arts instructor that has dealt with this from a US-centric perspective. Multiple schools I've taught at have basically had the generalized policy of \"look, this is a contact sport, this is a mixed-gender environment, you can either deal with that or here's your money back.\" \n\nThe reason I ask for your location - you're going to continue to experience this if you continue mixed-gender MA training, and that may not be conducive to whatever your goal is. Are you going to refuse female refs, as they may need to touch you to break contact during a match? \n\nI worked for a Muslim individual - to adapt a Dave Chapelle quote, he was 80% TKD guy, 20% Muslim. We had students refuse to bow to female instructors, parents would complain about mixed gender classes, owner of the dojo basically told them they could get a refund and leave, or keep quiet about it and keep training. \n\nEveryone has their own line wrt religious beliefs vs participation in certain activities. For me personally, as someone that spent 20+ years in the martial arts world, I see the mat as the great equalizer. Everything other than your skills gets left at the door.

I can imagine martial arts, especially.  They want to play the sport they signed up for, and while your excuse was genuine, a lot of other folks may lie about something like that, simply b/c they don't want to spar with a girl (mostly out of insecurity - they don't want to kick/punch a girl or WORSE, \"lose\" to a girl).\n\nReaching out to her outside of the gym situation, identifying your exact religion (orthodox jew?) and explaining the restrictions you abide by... \n\n... but again, she is already facing issues/discriminatory treatment from other athletes.", "NTA\n\nWhilst I don't believe in religion I respect the wishes of those who do as long as they are reasonable.", "NTA.

So she's an asshole for keeping up the drama and taking this personally, but hopefully, she'll educate herself. \n\nYou were polite and simply respected your beliefs, you're not an asshole for that. You're totally fine. \n\nPersonally, I disagree with those beliefs, and as a woman, I do find it annoying, abstractly, to make such a gender-based cut in social behavior. But alas, freedom of creed is your right and this particular belief doesn't harm anyone so, you do you.", "NTA but be prepared to be justifiably disliked by women because of your outdated and sexist religious beliefs. \n\nI still get angry about the Mormon boys that refused to enter my home to discuss the church because there wasn\u2019t a man in the house.

If you respect women the way you respect men, you would treat them the same. \n\nNTA, technically, but refusing to touch women in a platonic way boils them down to a sexual object to you. Not even being allowed to spar with a woman should turn you off from your religion if you\u2019re a halfway decent person. \n\nYou\u2019re entitled to your beliefs, but women are also entitled to feel creeped out, annoyed, and downright angry with you.

What happens if many men of your religion joins the class, and there ends up being a few, odd number of women? The women end up being left out. Even if that is not your intention, these types of classes often end up being majority men, not enough women to create their own class, so they have to make do with the mixed gender class. Bottom line is, women can't participate if men refuse to engage with them. As a man, you're in a position of power here, and you're just being completely obtuse about it. \n\nI know you are not trying to hurt women, but this is exactly the type of discrimination that closes off many spaces to women, and why sexism is so ingrained in our society. If men will only work with men, there is no place for women in the group anymore. These types of reasons are why it was SO HARD for women to even get the right to work. It's why there are still so few women in positions of power. \n\nWould you prefer to live in a world where women are generally ostracized in public spaces? Because that is the aggregate result of many people behaving like you. \n\nThere is a way for you to help without breaking your religious rules - please accept the restrictions upon yourself instead of making women feel unwelcome in mixed gender spaces. I am sure there are many men only martial arts clubs/classes. Why not join one of those? This gym might be the most convenient, but switching to a men's only class would really be the only non-sexist thing you could do in this situation, other than giving up your religion.", "NTA .

I'll always vote against religion that restricts human interaction for no reason other than in the past men could not control themselves. So instead of correcting or teaching proper behavior, there's a restriction. I know exactly which religion you're talking about and I have to ask, why? Why does it matter if you touch a member of the opposite sex? Do you think you'll burn in some mystical place? I get it, you're 16 and you're just following the rules that were given to you but reality doesn't fit the narrative of religion. It just doesn't. Technically, you're right because it's your religious beliefs but I still think it's an AH move in 2023 regardless or culture or religion.", "NTA, so long as your religious belief isn't  harming others, I see no reason why this woman is trying to force the issue.  Having to pick a different partner isn't hurting her, so she should let it go.", "NTA - But I'll bet the girl really would like to find a way to express that your religion was sexist without making you feel insulted.", "NTA She is being a bigot and doesn't respect your religious beliefs. You shouldn't be forced to have physical contact with anyone you don't want to.", "P sure this has been posted before", "YTA - unless you are still in a country where that is the norm.", "NTA\n\nIt takes maturity to accept other people's religious beliefs no matter how ridiculous they may seem to a non believer. She does not have that maturity yet. You were respectful and polite.  \nThe fact is the views of some religions are sexist and promote sexism. Sexism is not okay, but having a religious belief is. It's something that can be troubling to come to terms with, especially for a teenager who probably has experienced sexism in the past, and probably has very little experience with your religion.", "NTA.

While my religion is not as strict, we do also hold a certain level of respect and boundaries for physical touch between men and women. For instance, my son wrestles, but will forfeit if he is paired with a female in a tournament. Considering there were lots of other choices for her in sparring partners (male and female), you had no obligation to spar with her. If tables had been turned and she refused to spar with you based on any reason, my guess is that you would have felt disappointed, but walked away.

However, freedom of religion is protected by the constitution and if that means you cannot spar with a woman, that's a totally different story. It sounds like there are plenty of people (of both sexes) for both of you to find partners and it shouldn't have been such a big deal. It sounds like she took it personally even though you were very up front about it not being about her. You did the best you could do here, and it's not your fault her pride is hurt. NTA", "NTA it's admirable how polite and respectful you handled this situation.  At 16 too. However, The woman's reaction was very disrespectful. \n She needs to learn boundaries. no means no. She can't force you to spar, if you don't want to. \n\nEven your instructor understands this, so I don't understand why that woman can't accept it.   If the woman knew of your religious rules,  maybe she just wants to mess with you.? If she's still bothering you, maybe you can speak to the instructor if she's making you feel uncomfortable.", "NTA\n\nit\u2019s your religious beliefs. sadly so many in society are so disrespectful and ignorant to people\u2019s religion. don\u2019t let it get to you.\n\nshe should have heard you the first time and respected and understood. instead she chose to take it personally and act childish.\n\ncontinue to be respectful and kind to her, and ignore her rude behavior.", "NTA obviously", "NTA. Since you said Bjj in another comment, it makes total sense why you wouldn\u2019t want to \u201cspar\u201d or in this case roll with the other woman. In case anyone needs context, Bjj has a lot of compromising positions, which could very easily be interpreted as very sexual.

You have the right to religious freedom. But the girls you meet should not be restricted in their options in life because of your religious freedom. Not sparring with a girl - no problem. Not offering a hand to a random woman who might need support when slipping on the street? Borderline problem. Not being able to work on female patients if you are a doctor, or refusing to hire women at work because you might happen to touch them? Definitely a problem.

(I don't care if religion obligates sexist behavior, we should not outlaw abortion b/c some people's opinions that a millenia-old Bible that pre-dates abortion allegedly opposes it says so).\n\nYour opinion  indicates that you've never played any sport whatsoever, b/c it is generally pretty rude to turn someone down when they ask to partner with you.\n\nIf you can't \"touch\" a person of the opposite gender in any way, shape, or form, you should not sign up for mixed gender classes OR go w/ a specific sparring partner, so it doesn't come up.", "And the original scriptures could also be sexist in and of themselves.", "You should care that people think you\u2019re a sexist bigot. \n\nJust wait until you\u2019re an adult. People are being kind because you\u2019re young.", "\u2018Merica. Freedom to practice religion and freedom from religion. \n\nI dont have to respect anyone\u2019s religion.", "a sexist religion is a shitty religion", "If he doesnt want to spar with her he shoulnt be made to. No one should ever have to physically touch someone they dont want to and vice versa. \n\nWith that said he should not be in a mixed gender class then.", "Exactly, thank you for getting where I\u2019m coming from", "I should have expected nothing less from a child raised in a patriarchal religion. \n\nYou're allowed to go where you want, do what you want, and the women just need to deal with it and accommodate you, the man. \n\nVery mature. \n\n*And don't act like you've never made a spelling error in your life. Opening with that as an attempt to belittle is just further proof of your immaturity.", "No it's a lot of words to point out that you chose to join a co-ed class with no intention of actually wanting to interact with a co-ed class. Like you set yourself up here for problems. You chose that. \n\nJoining an all male class solves your problems. But then you wouldn't be able to discriminate against women which is the only reason I can see for you insisting on staying in a co-ed class.\n\nYou consented to a co-ed class. You chose that. Then you decided you wanted to change the established rules (that you consented to when joining the class) once you were there. Women have a right to be annoyed about being discriminated against when you choose to be in their shared spaces.", "Thank you for your comment. I am sure that he could have wrestled gay males without realizing it. However, with only about 5% of the population being LGBTQ, it\u2019s not very likely. That is a \u201crisk\u201d (I don\u2019t know what word to use here. Not that it poses any type of RISK to my son, but yes, it could have possibly happened without his knowledge) that definitely comes from choosing to wrestle. Would he knowingly wrestle a gay male? I can\u2019t say. That would be up to his personal comfort level. Our particular religious standards only apply to male-female relations. Wrestling is a VERY physically invasive sport. While it isn\u2019t inherently \u201csexual\u201d, it is VERY easy for your crotch/chest/inner thigh to be touched/grabbed in a way that could make people uncomfortable. Again - a risk. Willingness to risk accidentally touching another male in a way that could make them feel uncomfortable is a risk. I do believe that it is a greater one to have the prospect of accidentally touching a female in a way that could make her feel uncomfortable. Would most girls feel ok with it based on their choice to wrestle? Yes! Would society generally support a girl wrestler saying that she was inappropriately touched during a wrestling match because she didn\u2019t provide consent to be touched in \u201cthat\u201d way? I believe they would. We all do our best as parents.", "No worries you\u2019re good, it makes sense to assume since India is where most Hindus are from. But no I\u2019m Nepalese.", "I\u2019ve studied Vivekananda, not his guru though. Thanks for the suggestion.", "Fair enough. I do think it\u2019s lost its way in many cases but I see your point.", "He's a 16 yo kid ffs. Chill.", "Why is that a poor decision? His beliefs can be easily accommodated by allowing him to spar exclusively with other men, and it is his human right to receive that accomodation. There's no need for him to be excluded from the activity entirely, and OP has no moral obligation to limit the expression of his human rights for the convenience of others.", "she sounds so butthurt and pathetic bc he didn\u2019t wanna spar with her.\n\nget over it, at the end of the day it\u2019s not a big deal. she found another partner and will continue to do so.", "Do you do martial arts? This isn\u2019t uncommon. You sounds like an islamaphobe\n\nDo you tell women of they only want a female doctor they should go to a women only hospital?", "If you believe they\u2019re written by humans, sure. I don\u2019t, I believe they\u2019re written by a god who\u2019s beyond those biases", "People online? It means nothing to me. Considering the people that matter, like my instructor, don\u2019t, I\u2019m good.", "and he doesn\u2019t have to respect you, or your beliefs either. \n\n;)", "yes i agree, it is sexist against men as it states they are inferior to women.. but to each their own.", "In Bjj, there\u2019s only mixed gender, and womens and non-binary only classes. There really isn\u2019t a men\u2019s only class", "> I should have expected nothing less from a child raised in a patriarchal religion\n\nIt\u2019s quite literally a matriarchal religion.\n\n> You're allowed to go where you want, do what you want, and the women just need to deal with it and accommodate you, the man.\n\nNothing to do with gender, everything to do with bodily autonomy. I have the right to say what happens to my body. If a woman didn\u2019t want to spar with men, that by all means is okay too.\n\n> And don't act like you've never made a spelling error\n\nSounds like a cope for being uneducated", "As others have pointed out, there\u2019s women in co-ed classes who don\u2019t spar with men, because despite joining a co-ed class for the convenience of it, they have their own boundaries. Same principle here, I have my boundaries, and that\u2019s okay"]}
