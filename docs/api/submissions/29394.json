It's completly separated from the main house and has it's own kitchen, bathroom, two bedroom and living space. Our house is a victorian one type, to get the picture. She doesn't pay rent, I payed for her uni, food is also provided by me, and utilities of course. The thing is that she has it harder sometimes in life for being deaf, my father refuses to even pretend that she exists and he payed my uni, so I did what I thougth it was fair at that time. \n\nNow to the issue, we are going to Europe (Spain and Italy) with my husband, 3 kids and nanny. I told her yesterday that was the day that I confirmed everything and also with the nanny. She asked me if her room will be separated like the nanny's one or if she had to share.  \n\nTo say that I was dumbfounded would be little, I told her that when I first talked to her she told me that she was saving for something else (I won't say what in order not to give much info), and she told me that she expected me and my husband to pay her way. And question the nanny, I explained that the nanny will be working in turist things, and that I even if I never expected her to do that (because she isn't a parent or a payed professional), having the nanny makes sense while having her is just paying for paying (yes I know I was a little hard). \n\nWhat makes me think this a lot is that she told me that I could pay for her if I wanted to, true. But I do not want to streach our budget. Now I honestly do not know, should I streach the budget and just give in? \n\nSorry for any typos, I'm breastfeading my kid, the only moment that I have to do things. If there is any question, please let me know.\n\nEdit/Info: She is finishing an internship program in december and starting a very well paying job in January. This was what she worked for since school, uni and everything. So I was planning after seeing your comments to talk about either rent or her own place after she is finished with the interview. \n\nOf course u see that I protect her a lot, so even if it's rent I will ask her to start paying in march, also that way she can learn about expences. If she wants to move then it will be the landlord who will enforce it.", "created_utc": 1697923116, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17dcpmf/aita_for_not_inviting_my_sister_to_europe_but/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I honestly never took a vacation that I didn't pay myself after the age 18.\n\nEdit: I do apologize I missed the part where she's deaf but still honestly there are programs that can help her to succeed and yes it sucks she was given a sucky hand in life and your dad's definitely the AH for ignoring her but still she's an adult and can't get her way all the time.", "NTA: From what info you've given, you are already going above and beyond for her. She should be really thankful to have a free roof over her head, free meals, free schooling, etc.. You are not obligated to cater to her every desire.", "NTA. Your sister has a full ride already and it\u2019s getting entitled. Don\u2019t back down.

I assume you are taking the nanny to watch the kids for you while you and you husband want to do things that might not interest the kids.  We did the same with our nanny.  While nanny might go along for some things and might have some free time to do what she wants, she is working, not on vacation.  \n\nWhat your sister wants is a free vacation.

You are noy responsible for you father's actions. You already paid for her uni, her hollidays, her rent... it's way too much for a sister it's normal that now she feels entilted she must see you like her mother... but this is your fault you have to put bounderies you are not helping anyone by doing this.

It can be a little bit slower in her field, more so because her uni didn't had any interpreters so we had to put one payed by us, that also slow her.

I failed as a sister having her as my responsability is also my job to make it ok now.", "No, she wasn't expecting for me to say \"You share with the nanny\" but with my oldest.

I'm the outcast in my family the youngest of all the cousins, grandparents and siblings all hate me.

It sure doesn't look like it.", "All the money you used for her could have been used for your kids.

Now I honestly feel like she is super spoiled bc of me.", "She is in an internship, that leads to a paying job in that company. I won't screw the last 6 years by kicking her out, while she is finishing that. After that and after she is getting money for her job, I will either ask her to talk about rent and utilities or moving out.

My dad gave them wedding trusts also (even the boy). And the 2 that can go to school, go to private kindergarden and preK. International vacations. Live in an HOA. Don't have debt that could affect the family. There isn't money that could have gonne to my kids, that went to her, the expenses that I \"avoid\" are only mine, designer clothes, bags, jewlery. And still have my retirement account ready. So, sorry but my kids weren't harmed financially in order to help her. They do not live with my sister, read the first paragraph again. They do not even see her daily. When she moves out they won't notice, just like day to day, they do not notice her there because it is in my property, but it's not attached in any way. \n\nI agree that she is spoiled and that reflects on me. The rest are weird things that are simply not true.", "She might be, but don't feel bad. Your generosity came from a good place, and I'm not saying your sister is malicious.
