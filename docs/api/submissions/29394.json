She doesn't pay rent, I payed for her uni, food is also provided by me, and utilities of course. The thing is that she has it harder sometimes in life for being deaf, my father refuses to even pretend that she exists and he payed my uni, so I did what I thougth it was fair at that time. \n\nNow to the issue, we are going to Europe (Spain and Italy) with my husband, 3 kids and nanny. I told her yesterday that was the day that I confirmed everything and also with the nanny. She asked me if her room will be separated like the nanny's one or if she had to share.  \n\nTo say that I was dumbfounded would be little, I told her that when I first talked to her she told me that she was saving for something else (I won't say what in order not to give much info), and she told me that she expected me and my husband to pay her way. And question the nanny, I explained that the nanny will be working in turist things, and that I even if I never expected her to do that (because she isn't a parent or a payed professional), having the nanny makes sense while having her is just paying for paying (yes I know I was a little hard). \n\nWhat makes me think this a lot is that she told me that I could pay for her if I wanted to, true. But I do not want to streach our budget. Now I honestly do not know, should I streach the budget and just give in? \n\nSorry for any typos, I'm breastfeading my kid, the only moment that I have to do things. If there is any question, please let me know.\n\nEdit/Info: She is finishing an internship program in december and starting a very well paying job in January. This was what she worked for since school, uni and everything. So I was planning after seeing your comments to talk about either rent or her own place after she is finished with the interview. \n\nOf course u see that I protect her a lot, so even if it's rent I will ask her to start paying in march, also that way she can learn about expences. If she wants to move then it will be the landlord who will enforce it.", "created_utc": 1697923116, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17dcpmf/aita_for_not_inviting_my_sister_to_europe_but/", "score": 194, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sorry for bothering you.", "She is, the thing is that being deaf always was more complicated in some aspects:\n\n*Getting a part time job, while going to uni sometimes without an interpreter (there are profesors that don't allowed them), so she would have to videotape the class and then slowly read their lips while checking the books to see if she understood correctly \n\n*Getting an internship because many places on her work do not work with deaf people or aren't accomodating \n\nSo this internship was a first and her work will also be the first one. \n\nSo in this trust me, she knows how it's like the world and that there aren't many places for her also. That's why I prefer to talk to her, than doing it from behind. Also me and my husband have been her legal guardians since she was 16 almost, that's what contributed a lot in this.", "This could be, my husband and I were her legal guardians since she was almost 16.

Tomorrow I will show her the post, maybe it will spark something.", "No, I think that I took her to a wedding once when she was 19, but it was in Washington and we live in Seattle. But no, since that, no.", "It's very entitled of her to assume you would just take her on your family holiday and pay for her. I think it's time she lived elsewhere independently and stopped relying on you for everything and maybe it will stop her from being entitled to be treated like one of your kids.", "No, if she was coming SHE would need to get a room for herself.

And she was super lucky to land this, because there aren't many oportunities for deaf ppl in her carrear or her degree. Also she was at one point \"mine\", given that my husband and me were her legal guardians. \n\nI think that seeing first hand how she was treated and how little oportunities she gets left me in mom mode. So that's on me, she is spoiled because of my actions. And I will deal with that also.", "Since she is deaf and we are going to a specific city that does not take online reservations, I would have to called and get her a room. Not all places have accomodations and she only signs in English (the signs vary from country to country as language does). Also not many places even do know sign language, so she would need me to translate everything, not because she isn't an adult, but because the world doesn't come with an interpreter. Italy (second destination) would be even worst.\n\nEdit to say: Punta Cana is in december after the internship and 3 of her Friends are fluent in Spanish and sign both languages.", "Hey!

And I'm her sister and also was her guardian until she turn 18, that's why sometimes me and my hubby (who was also his guardian, we were already married) have trouble not seeing her as a kid I belive. For US she was our first responsability, and that's why we also gave her the best that we could. But I think that me at least end up messing up at some point and that's why she is spoiled now.", "I honestly do not know, someone told me that it was a way of saying like for sure?
