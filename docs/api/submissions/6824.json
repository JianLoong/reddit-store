I spend ages scouring preloved and consignment sites to get the bags I really want cheaply (wouldn't otherwise be able to buy them).\n\nSo I recently got a brown version of a bag already had really cheap on Ebay (seller accepted a ridiculously low ball offer). I bought the black version a few months ago and when I did my sister 'Kate' (28f) said she wanted one too as she really loved it. My mum said that if she could find another one for a reasonable price, she would get it for K's birthday. I said this was a good idea and recommended some sites.\n\nI mentioned just now to my mum that I had got the brown bag and was really pleased with it. She then went off saying I didn't need anymore handbags and I should sell the bag to her so she could gift it to Kate. She said if I didn't, Kate wouldn't be able to get one as they are too expensive to buy new and such bargain ones are hard to find.  \n\nI said I wanted to keep the bag as I liked the brown and felt I would use both the black and brown versions. I will admit that I have a lot of handbags (11) and I do find it annoying that my sister always wants to have the same stuff as me. My mum said I was an AH for not letting her buy the bag off me to give to Kate. \n\nAITA? I do want my sister to have a present she will love but i also think my mum could just look for another bag to buy rather than making me give up mine\n\nEdit: a lot of people are saying I should offer to find the bag. I immediately offered to help find another one for Kate and failing that give one of mine. But my mum thinks I am the AH for not just giving up the brown one immediately as she thinks I don't need two while Kate has none. And we know the brown one is nice and in good condition which is always a bit of a gamble when buying second hand.\n\nEdit 2: for transparency: the 11 is purely daytime handbags.

We talk all the time so I think it probably would have come up if she was looking for one. She tends to send me links to stuff she is thinking of buying so I'm sure she would have sent any she found or was considering \n\nMy mum, no idea. I asked if she had and she just said she hadn't seen any online but wouldn't say where. \n\nNeither she or Kate have ever mentioned the conversation again.

And it\u2019s really nothing to do with you whether Kate has or hasn\u2019t got a bag, you even went to the trouble of recommending stores for her to buy a bag from, so it\u2019s not for you to now stop buying things that you enjoy for yourself.", "Your mother is wrong and her reasoning is childish.\n\nEnjoy your new bag. Please stop sharing your finds with them.", "But you told your mom how you get the bags. Did she make any effort in trying to find one she wanted to get your sister?

If you agree with that then give her the bag and get another for yourself? Personally her being broke and her having \u201cfinancial commitments\u201d mean the same damn thing. Your mom \u201ctrying to get it for her\u201d basically means waiting for you to find the bargain and buying it off you.  She called you the AH because she assumed you\u2019d be part of that, if you didn\u2019t know of her plans then you\u2019re NTA. She\u2019s just upset that her easy plan didn\u2019t work. Neither of them were going to put the work in to find the bag.", "This might be a time where you just ignore her. She\u2019s probably ever going to be \u201cok\u201d with you spending money frivolously and talking about it will frustrate both of you. \n\nKate will survive not having that handbag.", "I have the same bag in 4 different colours and rotate them as the size and style is ideal. I don't need them but I worked hard to earn the money to buy them. You don't suck...but your mum kinda does.", "Fair enough.  Still you\u2019re NTA and hopefully everyone else gets with the program.", "Well in that case you either should help your mom find the bag online, sell her your bag to give to your sister, or give it to your sister yourself \ud83d\ude0a", "Then let your Mom pay you and have happiness in knowing you made it happen for her.", "You know this market.  Do you honestly think you can find the same quality in time?", "100% with you there", "Seems like a reasonable number to me! It doesn\u2019t sound like you have a hoarder type collection at all!  You could always offer to gift her one (if you paid a price that is reasonable for gifting) when you are done using it or decide to replace it with another bag in the future.", "I don't actually know how much effort she put into searching, she might have done idk. At the time she said she would buy if for Kate \"if [she] came across one at a decent price\" but I wasn't sure if it was a passing remark in a two minute conversation or an actual plan. It was never mentioned again and Kate never mentioned wanting one again. So I just forgot about it. \n\nIf she had asked me to search for it I would have done and I am going to now", "Ofc I immediately said I would help her find another but she says I am an AH for not just giving up the bag I have", "I am definitely still open to that. I would obviously just rather my mum bought a different one and don't really see why she can't just do that", "I think I could get another one yes. Whether it would be an ideal color and good condition is another thing. That's why I offered to give up one of mine if we couldn't get one. \n\nBut I want to at least try sourcing another before just giving up one of mine.

Mothers can be wrong you know \ud83d\ude09", "you don't see that it is the same thing?", "Her reasoning is that I don't need two and it's excessive for me to even have bought the second", "That is her opinion, it does not make you an asshole in my opinion \ud83d\ude09", "Aw thank you. Makes me feel better \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. You are obviously a collector. It is a hobby, it is what you like. You paid for the bag you can do whatever you like with it.", "NTA.

I have at least that and I only use a few but thats not the point\n\nIf you have something, your sister doesn't have an entitlement to it.  You can't say to your mother 'Kate has great shoes - I want them'", "NTA. You spent your own money on a product you enjoy (and lots of people take up thrifting as a hobby, she shouldn\u2019t shame you for it)! It\u2019s really not cool of her to just demand you sell it.", "I spent years in love with a certain bag but could never afford it. As in I first saw it when I was 11. My sister a few years into me loving it went and bought herself one of the versions. \n\nWas I jealous? Yes. But I\u2019d never have dared ask her to sell it to me or even complain to her that she bought it first. \n\nA few years later my family grouped together to get me the bag and I couldn\u2019t care less I\u2019m not the only one in the family with it. \n\nMy point OP is that your mum is being rude assuming because someone else wants something it means you can\u2019t also want it. Having more ability to buy something does not mean you should feel guilty having it. If your sister really wants that bag then she will be willing to wait as many years as it takes.", "NTA\n\nDo I think 11 handbags is a lot for one person? Yes.

My collection used to be much larger but I sold up to have fewer of better quality. \n\nUnfortunately we have strict spend limits for birthday/Christmas gifts between siblings and I wouldn't want to break that as it would just cause more drama.

Also at 28, Kate should be capable of searching online sites for bargains the same way you do.  There is some weird behaviour going on here", "I think it\u2019s funny how your mom all of sudden thinks you have too many bags because Kate can\u2019t get one.

As soon as my sister and I started making money we were buying my mother a MK every birthday, mother day, and Christmas. She always wanted one and I still remember her being so happy when she got her first one. She got alot of those bags and some others.

Like I have a somewhat ballpark number but yea lol.\n\nIf there was a candle that someone wanted to buy from me that was a rare and unique kind and I had two, I still wouldn\u2019t sell it.

Further,  ask her why she doesn\u2019t want you to give it or any bag to Kate.  \n\nObviously your mom recognizes the value of acquiring  things one loves and the pleasure of treasure hunting to get such items for less than retail.

Regardless, what\u2019s yours is yours and you don\u2019t have to give or sell it to anyone if you don\u2019t want to.

If you pay your bills and don't expect family to subsidize you, then what you spend your money on is your business. Everyone has something that they \"waste\" money on. I collect glass cats.
