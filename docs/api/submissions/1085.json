I'd have an honest conversation with them tell them your reasons why you weren't fourth coming.", "Ugghh hmmm maybe speaking to b and asking for an apology could help? Idk you are closer to the situation. I don't think anyone is an asshole, maybe just more communication would be helpful!", "YTA - for using letters instead of using fake names", "NTA, thats a very small lie and if anything it only harms you. I would encourage you to be honest with A, not because lying is always bad but because it might improve your friendship and maybe A will distance themselves a bit from B which sounds like it would be good."]}
