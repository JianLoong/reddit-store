He conveniently showed up to visit his kids when he knew his ex-wife wouldn\u2019t be around so she wouldn\u2019t chew him out for never visiting his kids. He thought you\u2019d be on his side, but no. \n\nHe needs to step up.", "NTA - You didn\u2019t even call him a deadbeat (which he is). You just told him to go through the legal channels if he wants access to the kids he abandoned. You handled it very maturely and respectfully to Emma and your grandchildren.", "NTA: I\u2019m a child of \u201cdivorce\u201d. My parents were never married when they had me so I was stuck in the middle my entire childhood. Kids need someone to protect them and that\u2019s what you did. I don\u2019t mean physically in this case I mean their mental well-being. It\u2019s important to have structure and him showing up especially without their moms approval could have caused a lot of issues. You did a good thing", "NTA. He can clearly do better as a dad, despite little backstory.", "NTA\n\n  \nStopping to see them once after 8 months does not constitute \"trying to be a good dad again.\"  But more importantly, he's been gone for 8 months--at this point there's no schedule to tell you it's ok for him to take them, and you are not obligated to let him into your home for any reason.", "NTA, it is so painful to kids to have a parent drop out of their luves. It's even worse when they bounce in and out at their own convenience. As a teacher, I've seen way too many kids crying on Monday morning because their parent no showed.", "NTA. *If you ask me , I think he\u2019s only trying cause his girlfriend wants to play mom to them .*\r  \n\r*I only met her twice and she called herself my grandkids mother.*\n\nYour DIL needs to get full custody of her kids. That way the deadbeat can't play games with his kids' emotions. The gf sounds delusional if she is pretending that she is your grandkids' mom. It sounds like ex DIL would have a good case. Especially if you stood witness with her in court. You did the right thing by protecting your grand kids. They don't deserve to be treated like toys.", "nta sir", "I missed the part where you called him a deadbeat.", "NTA, he really is a deadbeat.", "NTA. If Emma is thankful, any questions I would have would be nothing more than noise.", "Info: Does he not have custody? Why does he need to use the courts?", "YTA\n\nYour mad at your son, so your grandchildren don\u2019t get to see their father.\n\nIts not your place to decide if he can see them; but if he goes through the courts he can certainly keep you from them on his parenting time, which could very well be 50% of the time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he wants to see them, he needs to get with his ex and schedule a visit based upon their custody arrangement. He doesn\u2019t get to take advantage when you\u2019re taking care of them just to make his new GF happy & delusional. \n\nMake sure you let your ex-DIL know what the new GF said as well. New GF may try to have your son try to get custody of the kids (not like he has a chance but just to be safe) and DIL should always have her ducks in a row. She\u2019ll be able to utilize having you in her corner as well.\n\nEdit:spelling", "NTA.  \n\nThis is the best thing you can do for your grandchildren. Good job.\n\nFlaky parents like that create so much extra trauma for kids.", "Good for you for supporting your grandkids!", "NTA super sus that he came through you to see his kids instead of working out any sort of custody arrangement.", "If you ask me , I think he\u2019s only trying cause his girlfriend wants to play mom to them . \n\nI only met her twice and she called herself my grandkids mother . I made it clear she was only the girlfriend of my son , not the step mother", "I told Emma  I\u2019d support her she went for full custody.", "He\u2019s had chances to see them . I even offered him money once to just spend a few hours with them but he refused", "It could be worse for the kids for their dad to suddenly come back into their lives just to abandon them again. Him leaving the first time was a trauma. It wouldn\u2019t be good to expose the kids to a possible conga line of repeat trauma.", "She wasn\u2019t , during the divorce she asked for 50/50 even offering for Jake to take the kids even if it wasn\u2019t his time .\n\nHer parents divorced and she was tossed around like a rag doll with custody . So she doesn\u2019t want the same for her kids", "Then it\u2019s doubly better that you kept him from getting access to them. Imagine if he sticks around *just* because his current GF wants to play mommy\u2026and they break up. Then the kids would have to go through the pain and confusion of their dad abandoning them AGAIN. That\u2019s too much yanking back and forth for them to process.", "You sound like a logical person with the kids best interests in mind. NTA. Keep up the good work Grandpa.", "I would have called her \"his current girlfriend\"", "NTA. You are in a hard place and your son put you there. You are trying to be a good grandpa and your son needs to do better\u2014and it is right for you to hold him to that.", "Ok, but it\u2019s still not your place to decide.\n\nPerhaps  Emma has been awarded sole legal and physical custody and would support your decision to prevent him from seeing the kids, but if not, you have no legal standing to do so.\n\nI get that you\u2019re angry and disappointed, but if you love seeing your grandchildren, it\u2019s not a good idea to piss off the link between you and them.  Emma is going to be in a new relationship someday, and her moving on may not include prioritizing time for you to see the kids.", "I\u2019m just trying to understand why - if he doesn\u2019t want to see them - he also feels the need to wait until they\u2019re with you to see them. \n\nIf the only reason it\u2019s been 8 months is because he simply chose not to bother until then NTA. But if people aren\u2019t allowing him to see them until there\u2019s a court order then\u2026 I dunno. I co parented 50/50 with my ex for most of my kids life with no court order and it wasn\u2019t an issue.", "Honestly if I had to choose between him and the kids . I\u2019d choose the kids", "Quite frankly at this rate , I\u2019m considering leaving the kids the half of whatever Jake would\u2019ve gotten from my estate when I pass", "Ew", "Read OP's other comments--son is not seeing them by choice.", "As you should. They need all the loving and supportive adults they can get right now. You\u2019re doing great, Grampa.", "At the end of the day it's your $$$ to do with as you please. I'd suggest it go into a trust so it can't be help up in probate and it's harder for him to contest.", "Honestly, I would do it.    Set up a trust as suggested.", "Yk there\u2019s always that one person that says Yta \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d like bro come on can\u2019t be that lost it\u2019s obviously NTA !!!", "Ah yeah, then his son sucks and you\u2019re NTA, OP.", "OP - make sure that when you set up the trust, the trustees are set up properly and legal guardianship as well to safeguard their mother in the event something happens to their mother in the event of incapacitation, etc. so they're looked after to cover their well being before they turn 18.", "NTA. You did right by the grandkids. Your daughter and wife are selfish. They are too lazy to hold your son accountable.", "NTA", "nta. thank you grampa holy shit!!! thats gotta be hard but HE choose this. you are doing good by your grandbabies and their momma. if he wanted to be a father so bad he shouldnt have abandoned his kids. if only he'd have gotten his brains from you", "NTA - I don't blame your other kids for trying to defend their brother. He's their brother and they want to believe he's a good guy.  a lot of sibling relationships are like that. \n\nThat said your oldest is a deadbeat and you're protecting your grandkids. Emma is the only parent present in their life, so she gets final say on her kids until the courts tell her otherwise. 8 months is 8 months too long.", "NTA   Good for you!", "Just remember to leave Jake $1 so he can\u2019t contest."]}
