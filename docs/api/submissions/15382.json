And OP refusing an LEO telling him to hand over the kids would be risking a charge of custodial interference (or similar). I'm not arguing against that. What I am saying is that the LEO who came to the house would likely hear this story, question whether the father actually has custody and wait for the mother to arrive (unless that would be several hours) for more information before enforcing. OP and Emma need to get her full custody if she doesn't want her kids to be seen at all by the father, now that he apparently wants to exercise his custodial rights.
