Check out the cost for that many people and Cap it, and stand firm. Not a penny more. They cut the numbers or her family covers the rest of the guests. Weddings are so expensive why add another ridiculous expense on top of that. Is it possible to talk to her parents and explain the cap? That way they can decide to cut the numbers or pay the difference.

OP's friend \"assumed\" based on their experiences, bride is making assumptions based on her own experiences. There's also missing information...in my planning, rehearsal was for bridal party, immediate family, and out-of-town relatives. Given that the bride's family may or may not be local, that could change a lot of numbers right there. Also, location makes a difference. If the wedding is taking place in a larger city, $100 pp is not really out of line, especially if alcohol is included and with the current prices of things today  (\\*Note to OP--does friend know if alcohol is being included, or could that be an extra charge they will be expected to take on?). 20 people in the bridal party alone is kind of outlandish and makes me think that the bridal couple is also very young, and they may be competing for \"likes\" and social media presence and are not being realistic about the cost of things. Although $25k for the actual wedding day is pretty average to low, actually (not saying weddings \\*can't\\* be done for less, just that this particular wedding doesn't sound outrageous or over-the-top).

You should have just offered them a specific amount of money.\n\nThey are having a huge wedding with a large wedding party. You knew this ahead of time. You don't get to  un-invite their guests. That is beyond controlling and wrong. You control the budget , not the people.\n\nThey should have found a more economical dinner option once you told them about the money problem. And Yes they have every right to be unhappy with you. You promised to cover the expenses and are backing out now. You can be unhappy because it's more money than you had planned on spending.\n\nBut you are also an ahole for acting like her family doesn't matter or count. You seem more upset over the fact she has \"more guests\" than your son does. Those are their guests. The ones they chose to involve in their wedding. Acting petty because you wanted a larger representation is wrong as well. And yes the people doing her hair, makeup, ushers, pastor, music, venue setup/breakdown, or any other jobs are in fact part of the wedding. Just seems like her family is more involved than yours and you resent that. If all those guests were \"your son's\" you would pay for it without question.\n\n\nGive them whatever you had budgeted for the rehearsal. Let them figure out how to either make changes or makeup the difference. If the money is important and you can't afford it or don't want to go over a certain amount that's okay. But to be upset over the fact they aren't happy with you--- that comes with it OP.  You promised them something without communicating properly what your budget/limitations were.
