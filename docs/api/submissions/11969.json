There's a lot of things going on in our lives right now.  My mom is currently staying with us because she's going to be in the delivery room with me for the birth and also staying with us for a couple months after to help out.  On top of everything else, my husband got news earlier this week that his grandma passed away.  \n\nHe was really close with his grandma.  His grandparents lived on a farm and when my husband was a teenager, he would spend summers living and working at their farm.  He wants to attend the funeral next week.  He says that he already has a lot of guilt that he couldn't be at his grandpa's funeral 3 years ago because of the pandemic.  I 100% do not want him to go.  \n\nI could literally go into labor any day.  His grandparents lived in the middle of nowhere in the Midwest and we live on the east coast.  The funeral is at his grandma's church which is a 4-hour drive from the nearest airport so if I go into labor while he's gone, there's pretty much a zero chance of him making it back in time, if I can reach him at all because cell service there is spotty at best.\n\nWe fought about it the other night because I told him I don't want him to go and that if he misses the birth of our first child I don't think I could ever forgive him.  He said that I have my mom here and I picked her to be in the delivery room instead of him anyway, so it's not like he could be there for emotional support.  Which, yes, I picked my mom because she was a labor and delivery nurse for 30 years and I want her there because I feel she would be a better advocate if I need one.  \n\nMy husband is convinced that he can make it to the funeral and back before I go into labor, but it doesn't work that way.  The baby is going to come when it wants to, not when it's convenient for him.  My mom was trying to explain this to him as well and told him that his priorities need to be here with me and the baby.  He actually snapped at her to mind her own business.  I told him he can't talk to my mom that way and he said that he's not going to tolerate being ganged up on.  \n\nHe has stopped short of telling me that he's going to go whether I want him or not, but I did catch him looking at flight times on our laptop last night.  I asked him what he was doing and he said he wants to see what the shortest amount of time he would be gone.  I told him if he leaves and the baby comes while he's gone, that would be unforgiveable in my eyes.\n\nI feel terrible that he lost his grandma, I really do.  But this isn't the right time for him to be away from home for any extended period of time.  I need him here.  I know he has a lot of guilt about missing his grandpa's funeral and that's probably weighing even heavier on him right now.  But I also feel like his judgement is clouded right now and he's not realizing that me and the baby need to be his #1 priority right now.", "created_utc": 1678476567, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11nydk6/aita_for_telling_my_husband_that_missing_the/", "score": 742, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And pretty damned selfish. One of the closest people in his life died and you are pissed that maybe, just maybe, he won\u2019t be IN THE WAITING ROOM while you give birth. He is already missing the birth of your first child because of the choice you made.", "Most first time births don\u2019t happen until 40 weeks. I understand you are anxious but I think at 36 weeks it would be okay for a quick trip. NAH", "YTA from your attitude alone. He\u2019s going to miss the birth anyway *since you won\u2019t actually let him be there* I get that you maybe occasionally want your husband around for important moments when you haven\u2019t picked your mommy instead (your reasoning is suspect because there will be other qualified people there at the birth \u2014 do you not trust the doctors and nurses or something?), but it\u2019s not like he\u2019s going off on a frivolous holiday or something. It\u2019s his beloved grandmother\u2019s *funeral.* Ordinarily in this kind of situation I would\u2019ve said n t a because the father should absolutely be there but your selfish attitude is awful and tipped this to YTA for me, he has a legitimate reason to go to the Midwest, and you don\u2019t want him at the birth anyway. So you\u2019ve really got no leg to stand on.", "YTA. Did you ever consider the fact that your husband might be upset at you choosing someone else to be in the room during the delivery of HIS child? \n\nYour mom could help you write a birth plan, be available for advice via phone, and be nearby to tap in if you need something. FFS your husband could FaceTime her from the delivery room.", "NTA - folks, life if for the living.  He needs to ask himself what would grandma want? I'm pretty sure most would say take care of pregnant wife and soon to come baby.\n\nHe can always go to say his goodbye to her later. I mean, having his baby, what a wonderful way to say how much you love him... hehehe", "NTA, borderline everybody sucks. . NTA about not wanting your husband to travel when you might give birth. YesTA for not having your husband in the delivery room, but I fell that is a different question and not that relevant to the first one. \n\nI don't understand the YTAs here, even if he is not in the room while the birth happens (a decision that I disagree with) he could surely be helping out with the baby right after, bonding with his child and helping out with his wife. Sure, he is hurting with the loss of a grandparent, but surely your child's possible birth trumps everything else?", "YTA. You won\u2019t even let him be in the delivery room lol so he *is* going to miss the birth of his first child. You took that away from him. \n\nNow he can\u2019t even say goodbye to his grandmother, *just in case* you go into labor early? Really?\n\nYour mother should not be part of this conversation. Period. SHE is already going to be exactly where he wants to be once the day comes: at your side in the delivery room. Then, she\u2019s staying for *a couple of months*. That would certainly step on any spouse\u2019s toes. Wow. You two ARE ganging up on him when he\u2019s basically not going to be a part of the special day anyway. \n\nHe probably would understand missing the funeral if you had chosen him to be at your side instead of your mother. Because at least then he would feel needed. Right now you\u2019re just being bossy and a hypocrite. I feel so sorry for him.", "YNTA. I think your decision to have your mum there with you is extremely sensible considering here profession and experience. I think there is nothing wrong with wanting your husband to be there with you. I'd have probably let him go though if I were in your position. He'd resent you if you don't. Also trust me should you child arrive when he's away he'd feel really daft about it.", "YTA - We all really hope that you know how much of an AH you are. YOU are already depriving your husband of being there for the hirtg of your child! YOU are selfish  and a bad partner! FFS! I hope he gets 50/50 custody when the divorce happens!", "I'm going ESH bc he's not allowed in the room anyway so it doesnt seem like his presence is that important to you. It's your choice, but you're telling him your mom is more important. (I thought most places were allowing 2 people in the delivery room at this point but I guess not)\n\nBut he should realize just bc you still have a few weeks before your due date doesnt mean the baby cant make an appearance. My first came at 35 weeks with no preexisting issues, was 5 hours from my water breaking to 'it's a boy'.  If he is a 4 hr drive from the airport, he probably wont make it in time if you start labor while he's away.\n\nYou 2 are starting a family, you both need to make each other a priority.", "YTA. What exactly do you need him to be there for if you've made the decision that your mom will be in the delivery room with you? This is a wild power trip. You say you won't forgive him for going to his grandma's funeral, but have you considered that HE won't forgive YOU if he CANNOT go to the funeral?", "YTA. You don\u2019t want him in the room for the delivery\u2014 which means he MISSES THE BIRTH. But you don\u2019t want him to miss the birth. I feel so sorry for him.", "YTA there is no scenario in which he\u2019ll actually be there for the birth of his first child because you decided you only want your mother in there with you", "YTA.\n\nHe's missing his child's birth **(your choice BTW)**\nwhether he goes to the funeral or not, so he might as well go to the funeral?", "YTA.\n\n\nYou have completely ignored his wishes and feelings. Additionally your mom will be in the delivery room. All he will do is sit in a waiting room until the baby comes. Who cares if that's 1 hour post delivery or longer.", "YTA-you already chose to have your mom in the delivery room over him anyway so you are literally forcing him to miss the birth of his child. On top of that you expect him to miss him grandmas funeral when you clearly know how close they were. Regardless of you being pregnant or not, the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you. Sorry his grandma passing has inconvenienced you so much AH", "YTA. I get not wanting him to go but your communication is frankly terrible. \n\nAnd no offense but if you tell him he\u2019s not your support person and someone else will be in the room you shouldn\u2019t really throw the support you need in his face, you\u2019ve already told him you have someone better.\n\nA woman is entitled to have whoever she wants in the room. But when you have a wanted pregnancy with your spouse and you tell them they aren\u2019t your first choice and can\u2019t be there, well you need to be a whole lot more sensitive to the other parent than you sound. It\u2019s not unforgivable for him to miss the birth. Your plan is for him to miss it. Your title should read is it unforgivable for my husband to go to the funeral of someone who\u2019s basically his parent and not sit in the waiting room for me?", "So YOU picked your mom over him to be in the room, YOU can\u2019t forgive him if he isn\u2019t in the waiting room while you give birth, and YOU set an ultimatum that he can\u2019t go?  Sounds like a pretty one-sides relationship.  YTA, let him say his goodbyes in peace.", "YTA.\nYou're already asking him to miss the birth by choosing your mom over him, how much say did he have in that choice? As long as he's minimizing the time spent away at the funeral, everything should be fine and it's important to be there too. If he misses the birth by a few hours, he was going to be missing it anyways in the waiting room!", "YTA! Your husband is grieving! Nowhere does that seem to be a concern of yours. You sound insufferable, self centered, and unloving. \n\nUnforgivable? Wow! Your poor husband has years of shit to endure from you. \n\nYou don\u2019t want him in the room with you!!!!!! I think that\u2019s outrageous! \n\nMarriage is supposed to be a partnership. You can\u2019t even comfort him when he\u2019s grieving! And now you\u2019re threatening him. You\u2019re a piece of work.", "Yta for not giving him the option to be in the delivery room. Not like he was going to see the birth anyway you selfish asshole, can't believe you are taking that away from him. If my wife pulled that on me I would never forgive her. See how things can go both ways you control freak.\n\nYour mum needs to stay the fuck out of it as well.", "YTA. And a huge one. On top of picking your mother to be in the delivery room with you instead of your husband and the father of the child, you are forbidding him from going to a funeral to make a birth he isn't allowed in for anyway. You should be ashamed of yourself. You are a self centered AH. Did you ever stop and think that being there in the delivery room for the birth of his first child may be just as important to him as it is you?", "YTA and you are ganging up on him with your mom. She should have fuck all input on that conversation and should not even be in the house while y\u2019all are discussing it. That\u2019s rude to him. He\u2019s grieving, let him go - you have support if he misses the birth. I can 100% promise you he will resent you if he misses this funeral and you probably won\u2019t go into labor early, but even if you do, you are in excellent hands with your mom. Your husband has decades to be involved and supportive to you and his child, but just one more time to say goodbye. Damn, let him grieve.", "YTA. His grandmother died. You even said yourself they were really close. Also, you\u2019re not letting him in the delivery room, so he wouldn\u2019t actually be present either way. Are you prepared for him not to forgive you if he misses the funeral and the baby doesn\u2019t come?", "Listen I'm going to say this as nicely as i can because I have kids and I understand- like really understand. My husband missed both births 6 to circumstances out of our controle. \n\nEven though pregnancy and delivery is hard and scary, the whole world doesn't revolve around you. You decided before this that your husband wouldn't be in the room, your mom will be. So he is already missing the birth of his child, something he was reluctant to do but agreed to because he cares about your feelings.\nOn top of making him miss the birth in favor of your mom being present, you want to make him miss his grandmother's funeral, who he was close with?\nHe's already suffering due to missing his grandfathers death and not having the closure of that funeral- hes expressed how this has affected him. You now want him to miss this one too?\n\nDo you care about your husband and his mental health at all? Because all I read here is \"me, me, me, me, me.\"\nWith delivery room choice, sure what makes you more comfortable,  but acknowledge that he's already making a sacrifice there for your comfort and don't make him make another.\n\nYta, do better as a partner.\n\nEdited to add that parenting at the start can be hard and the first few weeks is an Important time for you tree as a family, yet you've decided to have your mom there to intrude on that as well. How does your husband feel about that?\nHave you thought of the ramifications of her being there, her opinions and parenting style possibly clashing with yours or your husband's. Have you thought of her possibly causing issues with your husband bonding with your child the weeks he does have off? \n\nEven in your comments it's still only about you. You literally don't care at all about how this whole situation affects your husband. You seem to be so selfish and self centered. What is wrong with you?", "YTA. You're making him miss the funeral of an incredibly important person in his life so he can, what, sit in a waiting room?\n\nMy judgement would be different if he was going to be in with you, but he's not. You already decided that, despite how much it might hurt him, because you need what's best for you, and I'm not arguing that for you. You're giving birth, you choose your best advocate and support.\n\nBut to top the sting he must feel from that with a decree that he must also miss this funeral, despite having no active role in the birth, is cruel.", "He\u2019s already missing the birth because you\u2019re excluding him. You are your mum aren\u2019t having a baby, you and your husband are. ESH", "YTA.\n\nI\u2019m medical, and while yes you can go into labor early, it\u2019s more than like Braxton-Hicks, especially if you\u2019ve had an uncomplicated pregnancy so far. Most first babies tend to cook longer.", "YTA - I'm sure he is sorry that his grandma didn't die at a time more convenient for you.", "YTA, it\u2019s his grandma\u2019s funeral. I still regret missing my grandma\u2019s funeral due to covid.", "YTA. He\u2019s not even going to be the room whether he stays or not. Just let him go.", "ESH.  \n\n\nYou for not allowing him in the delivery room to begin with, him for leaving to go to a remote area for a funeral.   \n\n\nAs crappy as your decision is, his just makes the whole mess a bigger mess. I think the both of you need to grow up.", "YTA. You want to have your cake and eat it too. What an abuse of your poor husband's emotional energy to be forbidden from going to a funeral but relegated to the waiting room whilst his child is being born.", "For the subreddit's sake I'm going with YTA. But really this is much bigger than who's right or wrong. I know you want him there but also think of him. You say you won't forgive him, but if he stays home and you don't go into delivery, will he forgive you? This could be a serious point of contention that leads to lifelong resentment. If your mom wasn't going to be there I could understand. But this is his last chance to say goodbye to his grandma. He may not get over not going.", "YTA. First baby so you\u2019ll most likely go to 41 weeks. So you still got weeks. I\u2019m not even gonna touch on you not allowing him in the room as that irritates me to no end.", "YTA.", "YTA. You\u2019ve already dictated he can\u2019t be in the room because you want your mom there.", "If I were your husband, being left out of the delivery room in favor of my MIL would be pretty unforgivable. The rest of the details would just pile on more resentment. YTA", "YTA \n\nYour husband is not good enough to be in the delivery room. And you are giving him grief because his grandparents funeral is inconvenient to you?\n\nHis grandparent who he was close to died and he missed the other gp's funeral.\n\nIF you are only 36 weeks then you could have another 4-6 weeks left before you have the baby.

You've chosen your mother, so you saying you want him present for the birth isn't really true. You just want him around... in the vicinity... nearby...

Its highly unlikely you'll go into labor at 37 weeks as a first time mom without any preexisting conditions. Even if you do, its not going to suddenly happen like on tv where your water breaks and you have the baby an hour later. There's tons of signs of pre-labor which usually show up like a week before you go into active labor, which your mom as a LD nurse should know. Have your doctor check you at your next appointment and if you have no signs of labor, there's a 99% chance he'll make it back in time. Also labor for first time moms is usually 48-72 hours from first sign of labor, so even if you do go into labor so early, he most likely will make it back in time.

How do you think he feels about not even having the opportunity to witness the birth of his child?\n\nI get that you are pregnant and feeling vulnerable.

My father was a shining example of that.  Fantastic Dad - not present during a single birth - most assuredly not the four that were Cesarean.

If he doesn't go because he's worried he'll lose his marriage, he will certainly hold it against you. \n\nDeath and new life both bring about powerful emotions, and sometimes difficult choices.

I wish you a smooth and easy delivery but that kid is going to be raised in a living hell if your that selfish.", "YTA you mean to tell me he's nor even going to be allowed in the delivery room to see the birth of his own child (surely then it doesn't matter if he makes it back in time) so yeah YTA", "But... he's not in the delivery room anyway?  Because you would rather have your mother?  So he's missing the birth either way.  I was on your side until that.", "Have fun with your divorce. \n\nYTA", "Yta,  he\u2019s not even your support person and your not even that close to your due date,  this makes zero sense to me.   If he is missing the birth do to your choice what does it matter if he meets the baby a few hours later", "YTA. Hopefully he will be your ex.", "YTA.  What would be your response if he told you that having your mom and not him in the delivery room is unforgivable? I understand that your mom was a L&D nurse but you know what? So are the nurses that will be attending.", "Wow\u2026.YTA. How selfish of you.", "YTA. You are the one making him miss the birth of his child so your mother can be with you. Let him grieve his grandmother and go to her funeral.", "YTA because you are so dramatic. My husband was there when our son was born and sure that was nice but it wasn\u2019t mandatory. Who cares?  Your mom is going to be there. Not long ago men didn\u2019t even go into the delivery room ever.", "YTA for having your mom in the delivery room opposed to your husband. So what if she was a L&D nurse. You\u2019re going to be a mom grow up. Then to tell him he can\u2019t go when you e already shut him out of the delivery room. YTA big time.", "I'm sure the delivery room nurses will SO appreciate your mom's input. Good grief. YTA. Denying him the funeral and the delivery room is incredibly selfish.", "YTA how clueless are you show a bit of compassion", "YTA - you\u2019re only 36 weeks, and you\u2019ve got a support person you trust with you.\n\nLet him go. It\u2019s a funeral, not a party.", "YTA and your mom should stay out of marital discussions.", " If he\u2019s not allowed in the delivery room cause you chose your mom, why can he go to his grandma funeral ? He\u2019s going to miss the birth anyway cause you want your mom there.", "YTA. you picked your mom over him for the delivery, want him to wait in the hall and miss the funeral. What else do you want him to sacrifice.", "YTA. I feel sorry for your husband having kids with someone who is so selfish.", "what is he supposed to do when you are in labour?as he is not there with you anyway, as per your own decision.he values those people that are gone. at that funeral he can at least be of use and have some form of goodbye to a person that he loved, sharing his grief with others who loved that person.\n\nyou being pregnant does not override that he has a life, too. what is he supposed to do, sit in a waiting room chair for hours and wait? feth that bullcrap.\n\noh and if you wanna bring up time:cool story, he will be gone less than 48 hours, they will likely not throw you out of the hospital less than 2 days post birth (or are we talking shithole  healthcare again?)\n\nand as you said, you have your mother, who is present as per your own wishes.\n\nand seriously, you wanna try using some biased person like your mother in a dispute about family? you really think that having that nose in the business that only concerns you and your husband is gonna help solving this dispute? how delusional are you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyta", "YTA and extremely selfish.", "dude he won't even be in the delivery room so he'll miss it either way i don't know why your raising a fit over this.. YTA", "YTA. Whew rarely do I feel sorry for the partners of pregnant people but here we are. I don\u2019t even know where to start. Your loyalty lies more with your mom than your husband in so many ways which is sad.", "INFO\n\nIs he not going to be allowed in the delivery room at all? Or is he and your mom going in at the same time? If he's not in the room eitherway, does it matter if he's in the waiting room, at home, or in the midwest?", "NTA - I don\u2019t understand why people can\u2019t see the benefit of having a L&D mother nurse in the delivery room?? And he\u2019s out in the middle of no where if he attends his funeral. Especially since this is your first child together\u2026 I\u2019d want him nearby too.", "Oh your the AH all right the minute you picked you mom ( I don\u2019t care she was an LD nurse for a 100 years ) at that moment you picked her over him. You\u2019ll never forgive him if he misses the birth\u2026he already is missing the birth because you want your mommy instead of the father of \u201cyour\u201d(it\u2019s his too)baby!! If your mother really is going to stay an eternity after the baby make sure it doesn\u2019t become a gang up session! Two months is a long stay IMO\u2026he needs time with baby as well. Also your mom is an AH for injecting herself in your discussion\u2026 again IMO!", "Yta, he lost someone important to him, and you\u2019re not allowing him to be in the delivery room, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he asked for a divorce at this point, you need to get your priorities straight or else be a single mom", "YTA You have chosen your mother to go into the delivery room with you and she is  staying afterward also. Still, you deny your husband - whom you've already shunted to the side - the opportunity to say goodbye not only to his grandmother but also to his grandfather and the place he spent much of his childhood. AH indeed.", "YTA. You chose your mom for support. You already have your support person. From someone who\u2019s grandparents were secondary parents, imagine that was your mom and your husband was going in for surgery. Would you be okay with him telling you that you have to miss the funeral because he\u2019s having a surgery you can\u2019t even be in the same room during?\n\nThis is a shitty situation, but this WILL cause resentment for you from your husband if you do go through with this.\n\nAnd I agree with your husband, your mom has zero place in this decision. This is between the two of you and she needs to butt out.", "Yta. His grandma died. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to Vegas on a bender.", "YTA. \nU are acting like he choose to have this devastating event happen at the end or ur pregnancy. He is just doing his best to juggle the awful hand he was dealt and u r throwing and temper tantrum over the fact he wants to deal with it ? \nLike u serious ? \n\nLife is full of unexpected and crappy incidents. Try to make this crappier for him.", "YTA so much. \n\nYou already chose your mother over him(guess the damn doctors who do this every day aren\u2019t good enough,) but you also used your mom to in fact hang up on him. Your mom really has no place in the discussion. You can\u2019t choose your mom *and* be mad at him for going. \n\nI would also say YTA for not asking your husband to be present for the birth of his *firstborn.*\n\nUnless you have medical directives otherwise it will ultimately be his decision what to do if you were unconscious otherwise. And your mom isn\u2019t going to scrub up and go down there. \n\nYTA for multiple reasons, and seem to be controlling with this guilt tripping your h too", "YTA. Seems like you care more about your mom being there than your husband. You\u2019re going through an emotional time and the angst of giving birth is of course real\u2026 but you\u2019re also being wildly selfish and unreasonable. If I was your husband and missed the funeral for the most important person in my life all due to your tantrum I would never forgive you.", "YTA you know you will have current labor delivery nurses with you, right? You have put your husband second over your mom sending him the message that you don't need him. Why in the world would you ever think it's right to exclude him from his child's birth. He's already out numbered with mom staying for MONTHS!!! Let him go, you obviously don't need him.", "wow. understandable, but huge YTA", "It\u2019s a gentle YTA. Edit: I just saw the part where he\u2019s not allowed in anyway, I assumed you could have 2 birth partners because you can where I live YTA a huge one!\n\nI would rarely say this but a funeral is the only real reason to not be there, you have your mum with you so you\u2019re not alone and most first babies don\u2019t come at 36/37 weeks, my first was at 41 weeks and my second at 39. If your husband doesn\u2019t go it will have a negative impact on his well being which will make it much harder to support you and could potentially cause long term damage to your relationship", "Yta, big time", "Major YTA. You chose your mom over him to be there for the birth and then allowed her to butt into a discussion that should have just involved you and your husband.", "This hurt me to read. Imagine caring for your spouse so little. Your poor husband. You are a piece of work and I feel incredibly sorry for him. Your lack of empathy is appalling - and you\u2019re not even letting him witness the birth of his child regardless! You want him to miss a funeral to potentially sit in a damn hallway. It\u2019s him who should be unable to forgive you. Disgusting.", "YTA  You are not letting him be in the room when the birth happens so he is missing out already.  You have made your husband miss a funeral to be a glorified uber driver and that is not fair to him at all.\n\nBTW, taking bets, Im betting this post is up for an hour and a half before the OP takes it down.\n\nEdited for spelling errors", "YTA - why do your feelings matter more than his? Do you think he won\u2019t resent you for not letting him go and have some closure?", "YTA just for not letting him in the room. The funeral thing is just you doubling down on it.", "YTA based on the fact that he isn't even allowed in the delivery room. You say that missing the baby's birth is unforgivable, but you're also not actually allowing him to be there for it. I'm not sure if he should go to this funeral or not, but you aren't being reasonable with him imo.", "YTA. Since he's not going to be in the delivery room then what does it even matter? You're upset because he's not going to be sitting in the waiting room for hours bored while you give birth?", "YTA\n\nYou and your mom did gang up on him, that\u2019s not cool", "The birth *might* happen during the funeral, and he's not allowed to actually be there anyway. The funeral *definitely will* happen during the funeral, and he *is* allowed to attend.\n\n> The funeral is at his grandma's church which is a 4-hour drive from the nearest airport so if I go into labor while he's gone\n\nI don't think there's anywhere in the US that's four hours from the nearest airport.", "YTA. Is your relationship just about you? He is in a lose lose situation because you are making it one.", "YTA  you \ud83d\udc4f are \ud83d\udc4f the \ud83d\udc4f asshole! How dare you take away the opportunity for him to witness the birth of his child! Because your mom was a nurse?? What a load of crap! You will have a capable nurse at the hospital. Do you even care about your husband or just married him for money??", "YTA", "I\u2019m gonna pray for my brotha that he somehow finds a way out of this marriage and onto a happier life.", "YTA\n\nYou are trying to force your husband to miss saying goodbye to someone you admit he was really close to on the off chance you *might* go into labor.\n\nYou also might not and he will resent you for causing him to miss his grandmother's funeral just to watch you do absolutely nothing at home.\n\nPotentially missing the birth of a child for a sudden Guy's Weekend would be an asshole maneuver. Potentially missing the birth of a child due to something completely out of his control is not. It's not like he could call his grandma and ask her to hold on a bit longer until it was more convenient for you.\n\nI hope he goes. This will be his last chance to say goodbye and he has a lifetime of experiences with his child ahead of him.", "Your the asshole a hundred percent it\u2019s his grandparents funeral he missed one already and you wanna take away this last time he\u2019ll ever get to see the other", "I was kinda on OPs side at first, until it came out that husband isn\u2019t even allowed in the room for the delivery and won\u2019t be there anyway.  \n\nOP has support right now from a mother who is a pro! Husband has no reason to be there. He can go for a single day to pay respects to his grandma and see his family. \n\nAlso, There\u2019s a bigger chance the funeral happens and OP doesn\u2019t go into labour.  Then she\u2019s really going to feel like an asshole and husband might never be able to forgive her.", "The important part of just sitting in the waiting room.", "I got to agree here..if he is not allowed in the delivery room he will miss the birth of his first child anyway. Why is your mother your preferred choice anyway? \n\nYTA", "By waiting in the hall? Grandma is family too, he wants closure.", "This! The husband not being allowed in the delivery room is quite the curveball. \nIt is your right as the person delivering the baby to choose who gets to be there with you, sure. \nBut if that isn\u2019t your husband you don\u2019t get to dictate what he can do in that time. If he even misses it that is. \n\nYTA, big time", "Basically, what does it matter if he meets the baby 15 minutes after birth or 15 hours?  I can being upset if he was supposed to be in the delivery room since that means the birth plan could be disrupted, but this seems absurd.", "Even more so since she wasn't even going to use him for support even before all this.", "Her complete dismissal of his feelings, beyond a cursory acknowledgement, is a huge red flag. Add that to her mother being in the delivery room with her, staying for months post birth, and the way they ganged up on him, makes me wonder if she even likes her husband, and if he has realized that he will always be second to her mom. Third, most likely, to mom and the baby. I feel bad for him. YTA, OP.", "Yeah, future JNMIL in the making.", "She doesn't want him there, as she literally chose her mother, not him, to be the only other one present during the delivery. She's TA. HUGE", "She doesn\u2019t even want him in the room with her.

My mom and hubby could be in the room for my first so they were. My second was during covid restrictions, so only 1 person. My mom asked if I'd be mad if they just saw me when I get home instead of standing in the waiting room all day. Giiiirl i told her I'd be mad as hell if she DIDN'T stay home!!! Relax, you can't be in the room, no sense in you being bored and uncomfortable in a waiting room for who knows how many hours!", "The fact that he won't even be in the room was kind of buried.  She chose someone else over him to be your support person.  Like what?", "This. OP, if nothing else please read and process this. \n\nYou\u2019re going through an emotional time in being so close to delivering your child. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re scared and excited, and it\u2019s all-consuming. \n\nBut you\u2019re displaying really self-involved behavior. Your husband is also going through a really difficult time. He just lost someone close to him and instead of being supportive, you went straight to how his loss will impact YOU. Have you asked him how he is doing? Have you extended any empathy to him at all? \n\nIt would be one thing if him attending would have left you alone, but the kicker in all this is that you weren\u2019t even planning to have him with you during the birth to begin with. Your mom will be in the delivery room and he will be waiting outside. So what you\u2019re asking him is to sit alone in a sterile hospital waiting room instead of paying tribute to his dearly departed grandmother. \n\nYou\u2019re kidding yourself if you think you\u2019re not the one acting in an \u201cunforgivable\u201d way.", ">you don't want to be alone\n\nAnd either way she wouldn't be, lol. Hubby in the waiting room was plan A anyway.", "This. She already doesn\u2019t want him there. He isn\u2019t going to get to witness the baby born. \n\nAlso.
