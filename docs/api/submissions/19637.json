After sometime our friend group got divided because we were separated into two classes . Now we used to ask ollie to be with us because the people she was friend with (who were also part of our friend group) went to other class. . But as the time went by , she started acting weird . One thing she did was i bought something from canteen , at first she just kept staring at it then after sometime when i did not offer a bite she just said can i have some and bit into my food .\n\ni was disgusted because hate it when i am eating something and people take a bite , it just disgust me . I have never even eaten food that was bit by my siblings .\n\nOllie did it next day too she took a sip from my cold coffee . Then one day i brought rice in my tiffin i told her that if she wants it she can have it on her tiffin separately but she refused to do so and just kept eating it from my lunch box .\n\nOne day me and my friend was talking that how depressing can it be when someone take drop for 1 academic year and ollie just snapped and said that you guys knows nothing about depression , just ask me what it is like to have depression .\n\nand no guys ollie is not suffering from depression but one of her family member is which is unfortunate (i hope she gets well). She started getting more weird and weird day by day to the point that our whole friend group started avoiding her  . She knew we were isolating her but she kept clinging to us  like  whenever i am saving seat for my friend she would just sit beside me when other seats were empty . After sometime i started saying no to her because i was never that close to her and why should i sit with her when i think we don't click .\n\nShe did the same food thing with me few days ago and i just snapped i told her that how can she not listen when i have told her multiple time that i don't like people biting my food because i feel disgusted when people put saliva on it .\n\nnow some of my friends are saying i was harsh on her\n\nso AITA?", "created_utc": 1686754237, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1499vjk/aita_for_snapping_at_a_girl_because_she_always/", "score": 12, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell her that you will not be hanging around with people who feel entitled to help themselves to your food or belongings, and if she does it again, stop hanging out with her.  To the point of getting up and leaving if she comes and sits beside you.  If she follow you around, report her to the university authorities for stalking and harassment.\n\nBut that said, I'm pretty sure she's flirting with you.", "Nta", "NTA. You told her not to do something and she ignored you. You tried telling her nicely, and she didn\u2019t listen. That leaves you with finding another way to tell her - and that usually means being snappy.", "NTA- if she has been told to not do it, then does it anyway then she is the rude one.  I'd not be spending time with her either. Seems she has a few mental issues of her own going on.", "NTA.  Stop leaving your food where she can get to it.  Buy a lunch box/bag with a lock.", "Eh NTA but I suspect Ollie may have some type of food or resource insecurity. Maybe she doesn\u2019t get enough to eat at home and doesn\u2019t have the money to get her own things. Not that it makes her  behavior admissiable, but maybe sheds some light on what\u2019s really going on.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is okay to be \"harsh\", if you want to call it that, with people that don't respond to calm requests.  You can only be nice and gentle if that works to get her to change her behavior.  If that doesn't then you have to try something else.  \n\nMy question for you is, why do you even let her get into a position where she can grab your sandwich/whatever from under your nose?  You can switch seats to something farther away, for example, or just not put your food down.  At this point you know what her pattern is, so maybe don't put yourself in the position to be mooched off of.  Any of your friends that want to criticize you are welcome to buy her food instead.", "NTA, she keeps being creepy and stealing your food, you wouldn't have been the A if you physically stopped her either.", "This is not flirting.
