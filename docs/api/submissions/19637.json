After sometime our friend group got divided because we were separated into two classes . Now we used to ask ollie to be with us because the people she was friend with (who were also part of our friend group) went to other class. . But as the time went by , she started acting weird .

I have never even eaten food that was bit by my siblings .\n\nOllie did it next day too she took a sip from my cold coffee . Then one day i brought rice in my tiffin i told her that if she wants it she can have it on her tiffin separately but she refused to do so and just kept eating it from my lunch box .\n\nOne day me and my friend was talking that how depressing can it be when someone take drop for 1 academic year and ollie just snapped and said that you guys knows nothing about depression , just ask me what it is like to have depression .\n\nand no guys ollie is not suffering from depression but one of her family member is which is unfortunate (i hope she gets well). She started getting more weird and weird day by day to the point that our whole friend group started avoiding her  . She knew we were isolating her but she kept clinging to us  like  whenever i am saving seat for my friend she would just sit beside me when other seats were empty . After sometime i started saying no to her because i was never that close to her and why should i sit with her when i think we don't click .\n\nShe did the same food thing with me few days ago and i just snapped i told her that how can she not listen when i have told her multiple time that i don't like people biting my food because i feel disgusted when people put saliva on it .\n\nnow some of my friends are saying i was harsh on her\n\nso AITA?", "created_utc": 1686754237, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1499vjk/aita_for_snapping_at_a_girl_because_she_always/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell her that you will not be hanging around with people who feel entitled to help themselves to your food or belongings, and if she does it again, stop hanging out with her.

Ignore her, maybe she\u2019ll get the hint", "Bta get a tshirt saying i dont share food..", "NTA.  It is okay to be \"harsh\", if you want to call it that, with people that don't respond to calm requests.  You can only be nice and gentle if that works to get her to change her behavior.  If that doesn't then you have to try something else.  \n\nMy question for you is, why do you even let her get into a position where she can grab your sandwich/whatever from under your nose?  You can switch seats to something farther away, for example, or just not put your food down.  At this point you know what her pattern is, so maybe don't put yourself in the position to be mooched off of.  Any of your friends that want to criticize you are welcome to buy her food instead.", "NTA, she keeps being creepy and stealing your food, you wouldn't have been the A if you physically stopped her either.", "This is not flirting.

We tolerated him to be nice, but then he started taking people's food. A few french fries here, a piece of fruit there - one time he swiped someone's sugar cookie, took a bite, and then *dipped the bit portion of the cookie into another person's sherbet*.\n\n\nIt stopped with me. I don't remember what I had on my plate, but I saw his wandering eyes and hands and snapped \"If you touch my plate, I will stab you in the fucking hand with my fork.\" He asked if I was serious, I said fuck yes I am, don't touch my fucking food. He never tried stealing food again - at least while I was around anyway.\n\n\nI truly don't understand how someone can make it to college and not understand the most primal of boundaries - don't mess with people's food.", "NTA in the slightest. Make sure you tell your friends that you have firmly told her NO in the past and have even offered her seperate food dishes (like with the rice) if she was hungry. You are not the asshole for enforcing your boundaries and if any thinks you are they are not worth being friends with because they will also be the type of people who think its ok to push boundaries. And I mean friends do like push and pull each other but if a boundary is clear and you have stated you are not comfortable with it, it should have ended right there, there is no amount of justification if you said it in clear terms.", "NTA for the food matter, especially since you've told her how you don't like that.\n\n\nBut you are an Ah for claiming with certainty that she doesn't suffer from depression. She's also an Ah for claiming that you guys know nothing about it.", "NTA, before Covid I never had an issue sharing food or drink with close friends (strangely enough sharing with family did gross me out) but even then they would always ask or I would offer a bite if it was something truly remarkable that I felt needed to be shared. That being said this isn\u2019t about sharing food. This is about being so entitled she thinks she can get away with anything and that people need to respect her lack of respect for others. Good for you for sticking up for yourself OP", "YTA for the formatting. Please type like a normal human being.", "Nta I don\u2019t care what she\u2019s got going on in her life.

But for telling her she can\u2019t sit in a certain spot, because you\u2019d prefer someone else sits there. \n\nYou and your friends are all aholes for avoiding someone because you find them \u201cweird\u201d. You\u2019re in university, act like adults. It\u2019s not cool to just freeze someone out who you guys were friends with (you said not you though).\n\nYou say she\u2019s not depressed? Are you a psych professional? You notice she\u2019s been acting weirder and weirder, well that can definitely be because she is suffering, just because you don\u2019t see it, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not going on.\n\nfor the food you\u2019re not the A, but for everything else you are.", "\"But for telling her she can\u2019t sit in a certain spot, because you\u2019d prefer someone else sits there.\"\n\nI mean adult reserves seats all the time, that is not an issue. Sure if there were limited seats or other concerns that is a fine take. But in a class room where everyone is guaranteed a seat it makes sense for friend groups to sit together and being together with people you like. This happens even in professional settings like board meetings, it is not immature to hang out with people you want to. It would be immature if the OP said they couldnt sit in the same row as them or something.\n\n\"You say she\u2019s not depressed? Are you a psych professional?\"\n\nWell I dont think even she claimed to be depressed since she then went on to talk about a relative. And sure literally anyone could be depressed but that is not what the discussion was so her being a psych professional had nothing to do with it. Also even if she had depression it is not alright to tell someone else they shouldnt be feeling a certain way because you think you have it worse.", "No I agree I didn\u2019t support Ollie telling her that she shouldn\u2019t discuss depression, it had nothing to do with my stance so I didn\u2019t mention it.\n\nI disagree with how her and her friends are handling this alleged friend of theirs completely and that was my point. \n\nAdults don\u2019t just ice someone out they do this thing called communicate. and that\u2019s what these girls need to be doing"]}
