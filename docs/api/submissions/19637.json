Make sure you tell your friends that you have firmly told her NO in the past and have even offered her seperate food dishes (like with the rice) if she was hungry.

Sure if there were limited seats or other concerns that is a fine take. But in a class room where everyone is guaranteed a seat it makes sense for friend groups to sit together and being together with people you like. This happens even in professional settings like board meetings, it is not immature to hang out with people you want to. It would be immature if the OP said they couldnt sit in the same row as them or something.\n\n\"You say she\u2019s not depressed? Are you a psych professional?\"\n\nWell I dont think even she claimed to be depressed since she then went on to talk about a relative.

Like, I was always annoyed when my mother or someone else would bum fries off me when she had food of her own>!(yes, I was buying the food, I'd even buy fries of her own and she'd complain, the cycle would repeat and the future would refuse to change, not important.)!<, but at least they'd ask. This girl sounds like she just leans over and grabs from your plate after giving \"the courtesy\" of an ask fiirst, but not letting you answer.\n\n>She knew we were isolating her\n\nThat's not isolation, that's exclusion. Isolation is when in a relationship with someone you overtly or subtley encourage them to stop seeing or interacting with people outside themselves or those they've approved of. It's a method of controlling that person through their social circle, because you know only vetted people will have your back in a dispute.\n\nYou excluded her from your friend group because well...no one enjoys being around her. Tough breaks, but that's on her for being unpleasant.\n\n>now some of my friends are saying i was harsh on her\n\nYour friends are gonna have an amazing life as push overs... It sounds like you've told her several times not to just randomly grab your food and chomp into it. She hasn't listened **every time.** People snap and get mad because sometimes as the Monty Python Skit put it, \n\n>You want to get anything done in this country you've got to complain 'till you're blue in the mouth\n\nNTA, because \"too harsh\" is really just code speak for, \"you caused the boat rocker to rock the boat\" in this situation.", "NTA I\u2019m a few decades older and am clear about the fact that I would not waste my time or breath on her.

Look where that led them, zero effect.", "Then why ask if she is a psych professional at all? If it had nothing to do with your stance?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you disagree with how they are handling the situation. Have you never been in a similar situation if the person is not respecting boundaries, is jumping in on conversations to put down another person saying they should feel their feelings. I dont understand where they are going wrong. If they were being catty and talking behind her back I can see your point. Like you are assuming they are not communicating but the OP has set boundaries which Ollie decided to ignore. Being friends with someone is not just accepting them for who they are but also accepting that there are boundaries which should not be crossed. And again the OP has stated they are not good friends with her anyways. What would you recommend as a better solution after the person has already crossed boundaries and have had a discussion about it?", "That\u2019s fair to be how you see it. \n\nI still think op is TA. You disagree that\u2019s great, you\u2019re allowed to. I gave my opinion.", "You\u2019ve misinterpreted my reply to you, we are here talking about wether or not OPs behavior makes her an A or not.

Telling this girl that you don\u2019t wish to associate with or be her friend is the best thing to do if she is loitering around and not letting go.\n\nJust being cold to her and icing her out is not going to give the desired effect, as evidenced by the fact it is not working", "\"Telling this girl that you don\u2019t wish to associate with or be her friend is the best thing to do if she is loitering around and not letting go.Just being cold to her and icing her out is not going to give the desired effect, as evidenced by the fact it is not working\"\n\nHold up why do you assume they are acting cold? As the OP said they set up boundaries and have talked with her. As the OP said \"After sometime i started saying no to her because i was never that close to her and why should i sit with her when i think we don't click.\" If that is not being direct and clear I dont know what is. Like your saying she should communicate and she is so I dont understand how you think shes AH but I guess I must not be making the same assumptions as you.", "Saying she doesn\u2019t click with her to us and saying it to the girl in question is not at all the same thing.\n\nAnd by avoiding her suddenly because she\u2019s \u201cweird\u201d is being cold to someone, maybe you think that\u2019s a warm reception but if so I have a bridge to sell you.", "I mean they started off by avoiding her which sure is cold. But she even said \"after sometime I said no\" which is a reasonable reaction. Because at the start everyone was probably feeling bad and didnt express to the others they didnt want her in the group and it probably just solidified from there. Remember these are woman who are young they dont have the social experience to fully articulate stuff instantly. My take away from this is that she was direct with her which is the proper thing to do. Sure she might have been an asshole for like a week whilst they were avoiding her but that I just give as time to adjust and realize what they need. Time to process is key not only in grief but in most things. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso I added this as an edit in the previous one but since you responded Ill attach it here \"So the depression thing had nothing to do with anything.  Because you said it was about actions and OP didnt do any actions in that part of the story. Its not like she told Ollie she does not have depression. It just seems like something you could nitpick just to add to the YTA but without any actual context, and saying things which sound correct.\"", " Yes she said no to sitting with her and sharing food but there is still a discrepancy as to what she actually confided to the girl, as far as the girl knows she was just saving a seat for someone else and that she doesn\u2019t like sharing food, both are still true actually.\n\nBut I\u2019ll digress perhaps she\u2019s not an A,  given the misguidance of youth in terms of how to handle specific situations. \n\nBut I think they could have handled this much better than they did and it was rather jerkish. Just avoiding someone just makes someone feel ostracized by their peer group and doesn\u2019t solve anything she won\u2019t know if they\u2019re just mad at her or what is going on and that\u2019s why I suggest she actually talks to her friends about the situation and they find a way to discuss it with her to avoid future conflict and discomfort for any of them involved, including the girl in question.\n\nI included the point about the othered girls potential depression or not was because depression is not something you can always see in someone and to make a statement like that without fact isn\u2019t rooted in fact.  Depression looks like a million different things to different people. \n\nBut yes, the other girl did the same thing, which was also rude to do. I\u2019m not supporting the other girls facts just we are again talking about OP, so that\u2019s what I based my response to her on.", "I guess its just a difference in assumptions then. Because when she wrote \"After sometime i started saying no to her because i was never that close to her and why should i sit with her when i think we don't click.\" I assume she explained her reason because generally when you say no the person will ask why. But you assume she didnt explain her reasons and lied to Ollie. And yeah a bigger conversation may be needed if they were not straight up and told Ollie the truth about why they are having issues.\n\n\"I included the point about the othered girls potential depression or not was because depression is not something you can always see in someone and to make a statement like that without fact isn\u2019t rooted in fact. Depression looks like a million different things to different people.\"\n\nAh that is not how that came across especially where it was interjected in the comment. But again that is my own assumptions at work there assuming that a statement before a conclusion (because the conclusion was for everything else YTA) is linked. Where as you only mean she was an asshole for avoiding her before telling her no. (Also another small assumption on my part because I assume on this sub YTA means one side is in the wrong and ESH means both sides are in the wrong. But if you are only considering the OP for the timeline considered (the part they were avoiding her) sure)", "Who bites phones? What a weirdo!!\n\nLOL. To be serious, NTA. Your food is *yours*.
