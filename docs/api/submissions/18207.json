She was shipping her off to her grandparents and would only talk to her when my sister made the decision to \"forgive her\". She made such a big deal, that I thought something horrible had happened, and she had done something that involved her siblings.   \nSo what did she actually do? She is refusing to watch her siblings when she has to study for exams. She is refusing to leave school early to pick up the l.o from the nursery because my sister can't be bothered as she wants to go and do her nails. And because they found a rainbow pin in her school bag.  \nThat is it. I am not leaving something major out.   \nMy niece is a teen. She is very quiet. She does not say much or speak out much. Not only that, but she is nice and quite funny when you actually listen to her.   \nAnyway, when my sister was done with her rant, I tried to reason with her. Tell her that obviously my nice needs to concentrate on school. Even told her I could help with pick up and drop-offs, as the nursery is like 5 minutes away from me. My sister kept talking about it being the principle, not the action itself (?).   \nThen I tried to reason with her as a professional. I work in childhood development in the social sector. So I was trying to tell her, that parentification can have consequences for my niece in her further development, and that families that use their oldest as a third parent, often lose that child later in life.   \nBut that only got her more defensive.   \nWe got into a pretty bad fight. I told her that I would stop talking and helping her unless she steps ups and becomes an actual mother.  \nOf course, she got very upset and told me I have no right to call her a bad mother. To which I said, I did call her one...but if the shoe fits.  \nI left.   \nA few days later, she texted me, asking if I could take her kids over the weekend. I told her no and did not answer any of her texts.  \nShe is now telling everyone that I am  refusing to speak to her because she is a \"bad mother\"  \nMy parents are very upset with me.

Your sister needs to get her priorities on order, and tbh, your niece going to live with her grandparents might be better for her. Your sister will probably learn the lesson when it\u2019s too late, so just there for your niece as best you can and maintain that boundary that you have enforced with your sister. It\u2019s necessary and hopefully it will push her to get her act together", "NTA. Your sister is an entitled AH and your parents support her entitlement. She needs her nails done and her needs obviously Trump her daughters need off a good education. I bet your niece is happy to be shipped to her grandparents house, she'll get to be a kid.  Thankfully your niece has you and your brothers who will stand up for her. You are right as soon as the daughter doesn't need to have contact with her mom she won't.  BTW Where are the young children's dad? Why can't he grab the kids?", "NTA.   \nYour niece will be far better of away from your sister.", "NTA. \n\nI'm all about not judging parents and whatnot, but Sheesh.\n\nPlease keep in contact with your niece, she might need your support", "NTA. You should have texted you're busy doing your nails. What a missed opportunity.", "NTA. I agree with you 100%. Your sister is the mother and she should act like one. She sounds selfish and immature.", "NTA your sis needs to pawning off her mother duties on others.", "NTA but isn\u2019t it better at this point to have your nice nice indeed with your grandparents?", "NTA", "NTA. What a horrible mother, your professional assessment is just perfect. She may have already lost that great kid by shipping them out. That said, they may be better off without such a mom...", "NTA. You are 100% correct.\n\n'She is now telling everyone that I am refusing to speak to her because she is a \"bad mother\"'\n\nYep, that is exactly it. She's just making herself look bad here, don't sweat it.\n\n'Then I tried to reason with her as a professional.'\n\nI do think this was a mistake; you cannot reason with someone who is determined to be unreasonable. You can be professional, but in this situation, she's your sister, not a client, and she's riled up. Focus your energy on supporting your neice going forwards.", "NTA you are right. Your sister is emotionally abusing and gaslighting her teenager and has the audacity to be upset when her daughter sticks up for herself.\n\nShe _is_ a bad mother. She's abandoning her daughter. Honestly if I were you and you could do it take your niece in and never speak to your sister again unless she has a _serious_ come to Jesus moment. Though she probably won't because it sounds like she's also a spiteful homophobe.\n\nIt's a shame that so many people become parents that have 0 business doing so.", "NTA - You are right for alle the reasons you listed, parentification is bad and is freaking out about a rainbow pin and being a homophobe. Be there for your niece and as ask her what she wants. Maybe she is happy to get to leave? Also closely monitor how your sister treats her other children.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
