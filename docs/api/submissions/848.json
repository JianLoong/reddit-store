The wedding takes place in early December. I really don't want to go, since I feel there are a lot of other things I would rather do than watch him get married to his current girlfriend.\n\nSome background: My father and I have a rocky relationship. It's been this way for as long as I can remember. Dad is a workaholic, and he has always prioritized himself and his interests. Since I became an adult I have been the one to keep in touch, with him only taking my calls occasionally. I can count the number of times he has called me in the past two years on one hand (these calls include birthdays and Christmases).\n\nAbout four years ago, my father divorced my stepmom after having been married to her for 20+ years. The moment the divorce was finalized, he announced that he had a new girlfriend (F53), let's call her Jane. Jane promptly moved in with him.\n\nEarlier this year, I had a fallout with my dad and Jane. Both of them are heavily invested in volunteering, and they had offered to host a training programme for one of the organizations they work with. This would mean they would need to be away every other weekend for the next two years. Jane has cats, so she asked me to catsit for them while they run this programme. I told her I felt it was far too much, and this upset her. She sent me a long letter detailing how selfish I was for not doing them this favour, especially after \"everything my father has done for me\". Jane and I have not spoken since.\n\nDue to my fight with Jane, my dad came to my home to confront me about it. He called me selfish and lazy. We fought. With my grandma as a mediator, we eventually made up. During our making up, dad said that he saw me as a disappointment and wondered where he had failed as a father for me to turn out like this. In return, I responded that I felt disappointed in him too. He asked what he could do to make it better, and I told him that he could try to keep in touch. A text, an email, or a call once per month would be enough for me to feel like he cared. He said this was unreasonable, but we made peace for my grandma's sake.\n\nNow suddenly dad and Jane are getting married. They were never engaged, and the rest of the family was informed less than two months before the wedding. This will be my dad's third wedding.\n\nI really don't want to go. Since the fight I have gone low contact, only picking up when he calls (he's called once in that time). I don't like Jane, and I believe that marrying her is a mistake, but I feel he is adult enough to decide for himself what he does with his life. So since he has chosen to marry Jane, he will do so without me there. My brother (M31) feels the same way as I do, but is considering going to the wedding and skipping out on the reception just to keep the peace within the family. I don't want to go at all, period.  \n\n\nReddit, would I be the asshole if I decided to decline the invitation and not go?", "created_utc": 1667312000, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yj9s8b/wibta_if_i_didnt_attend_my_fathers_wedding/", "score": 161, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
