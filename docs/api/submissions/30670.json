He initially said \u201cno\u201d & walked away. Came back unprompted & hugged her. She said \u201coh good bc I was going to be sad\u201d. W my fianc\u00e9\u2019s, aunt\u2019s &bestfriend\u2019s edits, I sent her this:\n\n(Summed up):\n\u201cWe\u2019re teaching 3yo that he\u2019s in control of his own body & self-defined boundaries regardless of how it makes someone feel. If he\u2019s trying to make someone upset on purpose, that\u2019s a different story. We don\u2019t want him to go against his boundaries to make someone feel better. I\u2019m sure you just want to show he\u2019s important to you but we\u2019d appreciate it if you could show it in a different way.\u201d\n\nFMIL: \u201cOP, I\u2019d appreciate you not sending me these kinds of messages and we have these conversations in person. Thank you\u201d\n\nOP: \u201cI don\u2019t really see a difference to be honest. I would\u2019ve said the same things in person. I didn\u2019t see this topic as one that needs to be discussed too much. If you have a response I\u2019m obviously open to hearing it, but it won\u2019t change the fact that saying things that could make my kids feel guilty & responsible for other\u2019s feelings will be accepted. Again, you can show that you care for the boys but not in ways that make them feel bad.\u201d\n\nFMIL: \u201cBc having adult conversation via text I believe are pretty cowardess. When you address me or any other adult, via text, it\u2019s not really appropriate, so I will end this conversation with if you can't talk things over with me instead of telling me what \"not\" to do then that in itself is a problem. So I'm done.\u201d\n\nOP: \u201cAgain, I would say the same words to you in person, nothing cowardess about the method I choose to say these words. The reason I didn\u2019t see it made sense to do it in person is bc I\u2019m essentially asking you a favor & it\u2019s your choice to acknowledge it or not. I wasn\u2019t looking for a debate about it, just asking that you please not make certain comments to my babies.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m alright if she\u2019d prefer me to discuss something like this in person, but why ignore my initial message? Seems like blameshifting/diverting to me.\n\nShe then went to my fianc\u00e9 & txted him \u201cso by now I\u2019m sure \u201cOP\u201d told you she was messaging me, if you guys have something you need to say to me just say it\u201d. They had a 30min phone call & my fianc\u00e9 told me she said:\n\n- she\u2019s already distanced herself from coming over & she\u2019ll distance herself more if she has to\n- it\u2019s not something she was doing intentionally (I never said it was intentional, just bringing her attention to this and potential repercussions)\n\nChose to message her bc I\u2019m HORRIBLE at having deep/stressful convos in person (I have ADHD so can\u2019t process what I want to say & what other person is said & formulate responses,etc) also this is a boundary so not rly up for discussion or debate.

Which, btw, is a completely standard boundary to have.\n\nAnd you don't get to throw back the \"cowardly\" remark when you are the one demanding the convo happen over text in the first place.

SMH \n\nShe's not even arguing about the content you're insisting upon (her interactions with your child), she just doesn't want to have text conversations. Maybe a generational thing, but you seem to be getting upset about a basic ask of hers.", "Nope, NTA AT ALL!! I am teaching my child the same thing, that they can choose what kinds of affection they want to give and that they have control over their bodies. All of these people saying you\u2019re the ahole obviously had hugs and kisses forced on them and want to continue the cycle. It\u2019s time we taught our children about bodily autonomy!", "YTA. Your first message *might* have been a reasonable *conversation* to have if she was forcing your kid - screaming and crying - to hug her. MIL saying how happy she was that your son decided on his own to hug her? WTF is wrong with that? She didn't coerce him. She didn't chastise him.\n\nInstead, *you* shamed her, *you* chastised her and are acting as if your three yr old is going to have lasting psychological damage over this.

People can feel however they feel and feeling safe to communicate those feelings should be encouraged. You over reacted.", "That was just petty, she said she was sad, that is a normal emotion.

She said something after he came back, but it doesn\u2019t even appear like her comment was made to the child directly. \n\nThe text thing, yeah. Cowardly, overly wordy, too much back and forth. I\u2019d probably have waited until the next time I saw her to address it, if comments like that became a pattern. You can\u2019t say that you would have told her in person, but then that you can\u2019t say things like that in person because of Issues.\n\nHer commenting about distancing further makes me think that this isn\u2019t an isolated encounter between the two of you. Is there always conflict, constant boundary discussions, etc.?", "YTA\nShe can say how she feels. \nPlease teach your child to understand what effects his actions have on other people\u2019s feelings.

No no no. FMIL is being overly dramatic and wants to play the guilt card. I would however would have advised that you told your fiance to tell these things to his mom as from both of you. Simply because it's HIS family. It's emotional blackmail what she's doing, first to the kids then to you. Doesn't matter if she doesn't notice, you can stab someone unintentionally, knife still hurts, you can try to be careful next time you're handling it so it won't hurt anyone but fact remains you already did. She's not acknowledging anything and is using the \"I didn't do it on purpose\" card to have the pity party. You explained kindly, you didn't call her names.\n\nIf she wishes to distance herself that's her loss. Kids forget the adults who aren't important to them quite quickly and at 3, she's not likely to remain that important if she doesn't come often and actually interacts with kiddo.\n\nNext time, ask your fiance to talk about the boundaries, it's his mom, he's the one who should because you two are a team", "Yta does this really need explaining? Just read your own post are you that deluded?", "YTA you massively over reacted to this, your child made the decision to give her a hug, this she said something that many would say lighthearted.  You have now involved many family members and made this a big deal, I doubt you will ever get your relationships back on track with them now, and your child will ultimately suffer for it.

You prefer to have these conversations by text so you can say what you want to say. However, I also think your MIL is NTA here for not wanting to have this conversation over text.

More than 70% of the communication that occurs is non-verbal (not the exact words you use but the tone, body language, etc).

For most people, having a conversation in person provides this extra non-word context of what the actual mood is. \n\nIn her first message response to you your MIL asked that this types of conversations are held in person, but you kept pushing on about the issue.

Yeesh, just reading those messages to a MIL was painful. \n\nThere's too much room for misinterpreting feelings over text communication for things like this. Especially with what's probably a boomer, or close to it. They didn't grow up with this stuff, for that demographic it's mostly reserved for unimportant and quick messages.\n\nAs for the outcome you want, that's fine. But I suggest you get some realistic expectations around how much previous generations are going to follow your child-handling advice. In their view, you're new at this and they've been doing it for decades. Yes, methods always improve and the more open-minded grandparents can acknowledge this. But old habbits die hard, and some won't listen at all. But it's also important that your kids experience different ways of people trying to manage their behaviour - because that's life.", "Esh it wasn't that big of a situation as it happened \" I love that you love my child, but do not make a toddler feel responsible for your emotions because of his boundaries. His body his choice. Thankyou.\" End of conversation. You turned it into something bigger by delaying it. You felt better to text it after rounds of editing and your MIL voiced that she does not prefer to converse that way, which you ignored and continued to do so. I understand having adhd, but maybe practice short statements you need to be able to say as situations happen. You also have to respect others boundaries as well as standing up for your child the moment they need you, not when you're comfortable to do so. Good luck.", "Just to provide some more constructive criticism\u2026.\nMaybe you should give visitors a script!! \nThat way you can be sure normal people will be able to meet your child without tipping him off that other people have feelings too! \nIt will be fun! It can be like a play!", "I'm going to give you a lopsided ESH with the scales tipped in your favor.\n\nI agree with you at every turn but this was not the conversation to have via text. It comes across as passive aggressive. I 1000% understand the whole in person conversation thing but words are only like...7% of our communication tools. Most of the rest is tone and body language which does not come across in text.\n\nThat said, MIL can F right off with this: \u201cBc having adult conversation via text I believe are pretty cowardess.

So I'm done.\u201d\n\nYour message was pretty well thought out and explained everything. There's no *room* for discussion.", "ESH\n\nYou should have let you partner talk to his mother.  Chances are, had he broached the subject, she would have been more receptive.  I wish she had taken your text in the manner that you meant it but texts are also easy to misinterpret (tone, manner) so I would agree, a conversation is better. But there was nothing wrong with your text.  Had I gotten that from my DILs (and I have had similar things) I would've replied \"oops Im so sorry!  I didn't mean anything by it.  I will be more careful in the future.  Thanks for letting me know how you felt.  Love you!\"  Your kids, you get to raise them how you want.\n\nOn the other hand, she got her feelings hurt and didn't handle this gracefully.  That's a mistake because In-Laws are always going to be second to partners (as they should be) and why antagonize someone who holds so much power over your child and grandchild?", "NTA but after her first response, I would have told fianc\u00e9 that he needs to deal with his mom. \n\nIt's absolutely okay to say a directive via text and, with people like your FMIL, it's nice to have things in writing.\n\nETA: I'm seeing a lot of comments that don't understand emotional manipulation. You don't tell a kid you would have been sad if they didn't hug you or act sad if they don't. You accept it. She's trying to lecture OP about acting like an adult when she's acting like an entitled child.", "YTA. She didn\u2019t lay a guilt trip on him. She accepted the no when he walked away. There nothing wrong with her saying, after the fact when he\u2019s decided to hug her and done so, that she would have been sad without a hug. \n\nAre you expecting to prevent him from learning that his actions have consequences and they won\u2019t always be positive ones? So he doesn\u2019t feel bad ever about anything? \n\nYour reasons for choosing text over an in-person conversation to begin with are valid, but nothing else you did here was reasonable.", "Yta,  \n\nShe didn\u2019t try to manipulate your son,  she let him choose, and she expressed her feelings after he hugged her.   People in healthy relationships can express feelings \n\nShe requested an in person conversation and you completely disregarded her", "NTA. Whether other people agree with your parenting choices doesn\u2019t matter (as long as they aren\u2019t abuse). It\u2019s your kid and you chose how you want to raise them. That said, I don\u2019t see an issue in texting this info to FMIL. However, when she said this should be an in person conversation, instead of doubling down, you should have either told fianc\u00e9 to deal with his mom, or waited until tou saw her again, and reiterated it. \n\nI have a sneaking suspicion that FMIL would have taken issue with you bringing it up in person, so it is what it is. Next time just have fianc\u00e9 deal with his mom.", "NTA, she only has a problem with you texting because then she can\u2019t turn around and say she didn\u2019t know/you didn\u2019t tell her when she does this again. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a big deal, you were just sending her an \u201cfyi in future please don\u2019t do this\u201d type message. It didn\u2019t need to be a full sit down conversation. She\u2019s very defensive", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

She's not entitled to dictate how peopel communicate with her.\n\n2)Nothing stopping her from picking up the phone if she wants to be \"brave\". She's just deflecting\n\n3) She's more then happy to start texting her own son so clearly texting is not the issue here.", "Lmao", "She had no right saying it. Regardless of who it was aimed at the kid could clearly hear it.  \n\nWaiting untill next time is silly, are you really going to bring up a issue from last week? Last month? Last year?", "Big talk, but doesn't mean much if you are letting other people or \"Your culture\" decide what your boundaries are in the first place. \n\nNo, she does not get to say how she feels. She gets to say what ever is best for that child, anything else she can bite her tongue. She doesn't get to feel sad about this because she's not entitled to anything. At best she can explain what she would like, but if not getting that \"makes her sad\" she needs to grow TF up", "This!", "... except her preference for text is because she has a disability that's known to cause people difficulty in important verbal conversations. Not every boundary request is equal.", "Yeah but. It is important that kids get to decide. I hate parents who force their kids to hug their relatives. I am glad OP is not one of those.", "What about the OPs preference? There are two people in this conversation. Do I es she not get to be comfortable??", "Grandma tried to apply emotional black mail to reinforce behaviour OP  called BS. Nothing over the top or misdirected about that. Replace \"grandma\" with \"uncle\" and see how well that converstation reads. No one gets to feel sad about this, and if it does there is something very wrong with their F\\*\\*king head", "Her comment had 100% to do with what happened. The MIL tried to guilt trip the 3yo to behave in a way that made her feel good. The 3 yo shouldn\u2019t feel bad for not wanting to hug someone. His bodily autonomy and not feeling guilty for not wanting a hug is a huge thing.", "How did OP's initial text not have anything to do with the situation? She basically said \"We're teaching him boundaries and bodily autonomy. Don't make him feel guilty for that.\"\n\nIt was grandma who derailed the argument to nitpick about how the conversation happened.", "Nothing stopping MIL from picking up the phone. Clearly she has no issue texting or calling her son to moan and complain. \n\nMIl  is not entitled to dictate how and when people adress her Ahole behaviour. If its not convinient for her that is her problem. And no one is required to be \"brave\"  to tell it to her face because she wants to pretend so has some sentistivities about texts.", "You'd be another lazy husband I presume there chief, with an attitude like that?", "I agree with you\u2026 she\u2019s a FAMILY members for fucks sakes?? She\u2019s not a stranger. \n\nI remember when I was younger, my mom would SPECIFICALLY tell me, \u201cthis is your cousin, go hug her!\u201d This didn\u2019t teach me that anyone can Willy nilly touch me or that I should be okay with any sort of touch? My mom was great in teaching me affection and boundaries towards family vs with strangers. Plenty of times I was told \u201cyou\u2019re making me feel bad\u201d when I didn\u2019t want to hug a family member and that only taught me empathy and a certain respect for my FAMILY members, especially my elders. \n\nIt\u2019s not that deep, people\u2026 holy shit. This is the reason the world is burning. We\u2019re overthinking shit.", "Thanks for the LOL", "Yup, she tried to overcome that by parenting OP's delivery. I sure hope SO had a sturdy spine and backed her up!", "it still enforces the same behaviour and problem", "Yeah, I can\u2019t agree with the \u201cYTA\u201d people here after seeing that \u201ccowardess\u201d comment. I would have replied with one word: \u201ccowardice*\u201d - and put my phone aside after that lol. \n\nAlthough I understand the importance of in-person conversations, some people (myself included) are better at expressing themselves via text. On top of that, having it in writing reduces the possibility of one person having a completely different understanding/recollection of the conversation later on. FMIL seems to feel she can talk down to OP like OP\u2019s a child, so maybe OP didn\u2019t want to have to experience that during an in-person conversation.", "There was no emotional manipulation. Read the post again. Read all the YTA again to understand why it\u2019s not manipulation.", "Are you two for real? MIL doesn't discuss it at all. Nothing stopping her from picking up the phone. SHe clearly had no problem calling and texting her son to discuss this exact issue. \n\nAnd no you don't get to overstep some one elses boundaries and then try to hide behind yours when they try to rectify the situation.
