He initially said \u201cno\u201d & walked away. Came back unprompted & hugged her. She said \u201coh good bc I was going to be sad\u201d. W my fianc\u00e9\u2019s, aunt\u2019s &bestfriend\u2019s edits, I sent her this:\n\n(Summed up):\n\u201cWe\u2019re teaching 3yo that he\u2019s in control of his own body & self-defined boundaries regardless of how it makes someone feel. If he\u2019s trying to make someone upset on purpose, that\u2019s a different story. We don\u2019t want him to go against his boundaries to make someone feel better. I\u2019m sure you just want to show he\u2019s important to you but we\u2019d appreciate it if you could show it in a different way.\u201d\n\nFMIL: \u201cOP, I\u2019d appreciate you not sending me these kinds of messages and we have these conversations in person. Thank you\u201d\n\nOP: \u201cI don\u2019t really see a difference to be honest. I would\u2019ve said the same things in person. I didn\u2019t see this topic as one that needs to be discussed too much. If you have a response I\u2019m obviously open to hearing it, but it won\u2019t change the fact that saying things that could make my kids feel guilty & responsible for other\u2019s feelings will be accepted. Again, you can show that you care for the boys but not in ways that make them feel bad.\u201d\n\nFMIL: \u201cBc having adult conversation via text I believe are pretty cowardess. When you address me or any other adult, via text, it\u2019s not really appropriate, so I will end this conversation with if you can't talk things over with me instead of telling me what \"not\" to do then that in itself is a problem. So I'm done.\u201d\n\nOP: \u201cAgain, I would say the same words to you in person, nothing cowardess about the method I choose to say these words. The reason I didn\u2019t see it made sense to do it in person is bc I\u2019m essentially asking you a favor & it\u2019s your choice to acknowledge it or not. I wasn\u2019t looking for a debate about it, just asking that you please not make certain comments to my babies.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m alright if she\u2019d prefer me to discuss something like this in person, but why ignore my initial message? Seems like blameshifting/diverting to me.\n\nShe then went to my fianc\u00e9 & txted him \u201cso by now I\u2019m sure \u201cOP\u201d told you she was messaging me, if you guys have something you need to say to me just say it\u201d. They had a 30min phone call & my fianc\u00e9 told me she said:\n\n- she\u2019s already distanced herself from coming over & she\u2019ll distance herself more if she has to\n- it\u2019s not something she was doing intentionally (I never said it was intentional, just bringing her attention to this and potential repercussions)\n\nChose to message her bc I\u2019m HORRIBLE at having deep/stressful convos in person (I have ADHD so can\u2019t process what I want to say & what other person is said & formulate responses,etc) also this is a boundary so not rly up for discussion or debate.

Which, btw, is a completely standard boundary to have.\n\nAnd you don't get to throw back the \"cowardly\" remark when you are the one demanding the convo happen over text in the first place.

Maybe a generational thing, but you seem to be getting upset about a basic ask of hers.", "Nope, NTA AT ALL!! I am teaching my child the same thing, that they can choose what kinds of affection they want to give and that they have control over their bodies. All of these people saying you\u2019re the ahole obviously had hugs and kisses forced on them and want to continue the cycle. It\u2019s time we taught our children about bodily autonomy!", "YTA. Your first message *might* have been a reasonable *conversation* to have if she was forcing your kid - screaming and crying - to hug her. MIL saying how happy she was that your son decided on his own to hug her? WTF is wrong with that? She didn't coerce him. She didn't chastise him.\n\nInstead, *you* shamed her, *you* chastised her and are acting as if your three yr old is going to have lasting psychological damage over this.

People can feel however they feel and feeling safe to communicate those feelings should be encouraged. You over reacted.", "That was just petty, she said she was sad, that is a normal emotion.

She said something after he came back, but it doesn\u2019t even appear like her comment was made to the child directly. \n\nThe text thing, yeah. Cowardly, overly wordy, too much back and forth. I\u2019d probably have waited until the next time I saw her to address it, if comments like that became a pattern. You can\u2019t say that you would have told her in person, but then that you can\u2019t say things like that in person because of Issues.\n\nHer commenting about distancing further makes me think that this isn\u2019t an isolated encounter between the two of you. Is there always conflict, constant boundary discussions, etc.?", "YTA\nShe can say how she feels. \nPlease teach your child to understand what effects his actions have on other people\u2019s feelings.

No no no. FMIL is being overly dramatic and wants to play the guilt card. I would however would have advised that you told your fiance to tell these things to his mom as from both of you. Simply because it's HIS family. It's emotional blackmail what she's doing, first to the kids then to you. Doesn't matter if she doesn't notice, you can stab someone unintentionally, knife still hurts, you can try to be careful next time you're handling it so it won't hurt anyone but fact remains you already did. She's not acknowledging anything and is using the \"I didn't do it on purpose\" card to have the pity party. You explained kindly, you didn't call her names.\n\nIf she wishes to distance herself that's her loss. Kids forget the adults who aren't important to them quite quickly and at 3, she's not likely to remain that important if she doesn't come often and actually interacts with kiddo.\n\nNext time, ask your fiance to talk about the boundaries, it's his mom, he's the one who should because you two are a team", "Yta does this really need explaining? Just read your own post are you that deluded?", "YTA you massively over reacted to this, your child made the decision to give her a hug, this she said something that many would say lighthearted.  You have now involved many family members and made this a big deal, I doubt you will ever get your relationships back on track with them now, and your child will ultimately suffer for it.

More than 70% of the communication that occurs is non-verbal (not the exact words you use but the tone, body language, etc).

For most people, having a conversation in person provides this extra non-word context of what the actual mood is. \n\nIn her first message response to you your MIL asked that this types of conversations are held in person, but you kept pushing on about the issue.

They didn't grow up with this stuff, for that demographic it's mostly reserved for unimportant and quick messages.\n\nAs for the outcome you want, that's fine. But I suggest you get some realistic expectations around how much previous generations are going to follow your child-handling advice. In their view, you're new at this and they've been doing it for decades. Yes, methods always improve and the more open-minded grandparents can acknowledge this. But old habbits die hard, and some won't listen at all.

His body his choice. Thankyou.\" End of conversation. You turned it into something bigger by delaying it. You felt better to text it after rounds of editing and your MIL voiced that she does not prefer to converse that way, which you ignored and continued to do so.

The core of the idea was met. MIL did not express displeasure with him making his choice--if MIL tweaked her comment after to be \"thank you for the hug\" or \"this made me happy\" it would have been better, but I think we all know that that is what she meant and not what she said. She is within her right express her joy in bonding with him after he chose to bond with her. I think you would have been more precise had you asked her to rephrase it in a positive way that reflects more on her feelings than on him after he gave consent. Anything less is asking her to be totally neutral and that isn't very human, even if adults are capable of being neutral (which is what she did when he made his decision).\n\nIt's kind of weird to be so wound up about a situation that wasn't a problem because it verged on being out of your control. I really like this methodology of teaching bodily autonomy, but it is weird to go out of your way to demand someone's time at a random time after they have left to correct someone's behavior when it was mostly correct--it probably would have been a more productive conversation had you waited to bring it up in passing the next time you saw her rather than basically demanding her attention out of the blue to insist she changes a behavior that was barely incongruent with what you want from her.\n\nHer \"cowardess\" comment was pushy, but I understand why she felt attacked, or aggressed upon, or annoyed, and for someone demanding to split hairs about communication, you should have some room to compromise when she said she preferred to speak in person and that nuances of communication matter to her too--partly because asking to speak in person/saying they wish they could have spoken in person is also something people say when they are trying to tell you they are not ready to discuss it this very minute, don't want to leave you on read, and are frustrated by having to choose between the two. Facts are that your kid's autonomy was respected and you still feel compelled to control every smidge of the situation because it wasn't how you wanted it--it deviated slightly from the image in your head.\n\nMaybe just don't hang out with her if she is too stressful to talk to in person, these situations are too important to wait until the next time you see her, and you feel this situation brought great harm to your child.

Bodily autonomy is important, but so is basic social interaction with family members.  Your MIL didn't hurt your son with the *being sad* remark.  It's honest and harmless to tell someone that rejected affection is an emotional let down.  Children do not benefit from us hiding facts from them and pretending that everything they do always makes everyone happy.  This will do more harm than good. \n\nI support you on the text vs. in person thing, but I'll offer a suggestion for consideration.  Some people, especially the generations who were not raised with smart phones in their lives, find texting to be a bit cold and disconnected.  Understand that that might be her perspective, and that, just as she may have experienced a bit of hurt feelings if her grandchild had refused her affections, she may interpret a text conversation as a way of shielding yourself from connecting with her genuinely.  It doesn't make her right or you wrong.  It just colors her point of view, just as your social anxiety colors your point of view, and I think understanding that may be meaningful in moving forward in your relationship with her.", "NTA - whether you say it in writing or verbally makes no difference.

Anyone who knows anything about this at all would already know that a therapist will tell you to confront issues however you are most comfortable and work your way up.

She didn't, she treated OP like a child and brushed her off, never once responding to the message itself, simply demanding that she cease communication which is not how you talk to a fellow adult.

I\u2019ll walk it and feed it, I promise! I\u2019ll do all my chores! Can we please, mummy?\u201d That\u2019s manipulation, lol.

Grandma probably didn\u2019t intend to cause this child any harm.

I\u2019m sure there was no ill intent behind it. There wasn\u2019t when adults did this to me as a kid. But at the end of the day, intent doesn\u2019t always matter as much as we\u2019d like it to. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, and the impact is ultimately what matters. I may not have meant to break that plate, but my good intentions do not change the fact that the plate is broken. \n\nThe way she responded to OP\u2019s request is the most revealing part of it all, to me.

They want the TODDLER to grow up to understand good boundaries and one of them is that they don't have to be touched by anyone unless their parent says it's okay or they want the touch themselves. This is an important boundary because it can help fight against child abuse because the child knows it can say no and the respectful adults in their lives listen to that no so if there is an adult that does it even after the child says no, they're more likely to realize that it's wrong and therefore tell someone they trust. To a toddler, stating that something they did made you sad is completely manipulative if it's something you wanted and they didn't like being touched. They're allowed to have respectful boundaries.

I can of course choose to not talk this line of thinking out loud, but then I\u2019m just sitting there silently running through the 1000+ scenarios to figure out my opinion and feelings on a particular point which leads to the other person getting cranky that I\u2019m just sitting there silent silent, they then assume I have nothing to say and angrily move on.
