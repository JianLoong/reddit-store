We were *very* casually saying for five months before that but I don\u2019t count that as us being \u201ctogether\u201d because he was dating other people \n\nMy friend \u201cAlek\u201d and I have known each other forever because our grandfathers were friends. They became friends as a result of the Holocaust. They grew up in the same area, and my great aunt saved Alek\u2019s grandfather\u2019s life. They survived, and emigrated to the same country where they remained friends their whole lives. Our families are very connected. Last month, on the anniversary of my grandfather\u2019s death, Alek and I began discussing taking a trip to my grandfather\u2019s birth country, and other places associated with their lives. We decided to take the trip for three weeks early next year. \n\nMy boyfriend \u201cEzra\u201d is mad that I didn\u2019t invite him. I told him this was a trip about my and Alek\u2019s family history, and something we wanted to do together to connect with our heritage, it\u2019s not a resort vacation. He said he is hurt that I don\u2019t want to share this with him. I keep telling him this isn\u2019t chicken nuggets and I don\u2019t want to share, this is something that just patently doesn\u2019t include him and something I just want to do with Alek, and he\u2019s being irrationally jealous. \n\nFriends I\u2019ve spoken to say I absolutely have the right to go, but they don\u2019t blame him for being hurt that I want to go travelling with another guy. They say I should maybe invite him for a few days if the trip and if I don\u2019t want him to come to specific places that\u2019s fine but I should find a way to include him on the trip. I don\u2019t think I should have to invite him just to pander to his jealousy and fomo. \n\nAITA for not inviting him?\n", "created_utc": 1702993596, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18m29c4/aita_for_not_inviting_my_boyfriend_to_come_on_a/", "score": 1289, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ezra is barely your boyfriend. He may not even *be* your boyfriend by the time you go on this trip. Alek is a lifelong friend who is going to be around way after Ezra. \n\nEven if this was a more long-term partner, I still don't think you would be an AH for wanting to take what is going to be a very special, and probably very emotionally charged, trip with a friend who has a similar background and is going to under stand what you're going through. The very short term nature of the relationship is just icing on the cake. Also, you call your boyfriend \"Ezra\" which is a Hebrew name, but is Ezra Jewish (religiously or ethnically)? Because if Ezra is also not Jewish, this trip is not going to have the same meaning to him.", "Edit to add judgment since she provided the info NTA. I don't see the relationship lasting but they've only been together 3 months so nbd right. I would have called her the AH if she'd been this dismissive in a 2 or 3 year relationship. \n\nInfo : how long have you been dating Ezra?\n\nEta reason for asking is if it's been a couple months of dating and not really serious I could understand him not coming. But if it's a serious relationship, and prospects of a future together saying that it's not his business or family could look bad.", "Yeah very NTA - you\u2019ve been with him for 3 months, you have no idea if you travel well together and if they\u2019re compatible for this. Especially with international travel involved, you don\u2019t plan that with 3 mo long relationship. \n\n3mo is still in the \u201cconsidering what a life could maybe look like stage\u201d it\u2019s definitely not the \u201cpractically married\u201d stage. But also, it wouldn\u2019t really matter, even if you were married to him, that doesn\u2019t stop you from being your own person with your own friends and interests and yes even sometimes your own trips. \n\nAlso, as someone with a similarly blended family of generations (different shared experiences to form it) that\u2019s like planning a trip with a sibling or a cousin. But also, I\u2019m sorry, fellow commenters what is so magical about the male gender that dating one completely destroys your ability to have any other relationship with any other??? No one in the world has ever suggested that my girlfriend was going to be jealous when I planned a trip with a group of women. So that\u2019s just weird and gross. \n\nAlso this trip is more akin to a pilgrimage then a vacation - it\u2019s not about joy and it\u2019s not about teaching some new guy that may or may not be in it for life, it\u2019s about returning to a very traumatic place and walking the steps their ancestors were forced to walk. That\u2019s brutal heavy stuff, that\u2019s not a moment or a place to try to bring some new fellow \u201cinto your culture\u201d", "NTA, but just be aware that you will definitely be single by the time you get back from your trip. \n\n3 months is too early to be inviting him on a trip of such significance, but he also has every right to be upset that you\u2019re going on a trip  for 3 weeks by yourself with another man, regardless of the circumstances. But it doesn\u2019t sound like this will really bother you, your tone about him through the whole description says that you\u2019ve already checked out of the relationship.", "He's barely been official 3 months and wanna strong arm his way onto your highly personal trip?\n\nNTA.\n\nAnd to whomever saying \"Oh but it's understandable that he's jealous you're travelling with some guy\" I'd say \"Well he wants to include the time he spent /dating other people/ as time he has been /dating me/. So I call BS.\"\n\nETA, I was under the mistaken impression Ezra thought their relationship was 5 months long. He thinks they've been dating for 8, just that 5 of them were super casual and he was seeing others.", "NTA\n\nThe edit makes this pretty simple in my eyes. You have been together for 3 months... When you started planning the trip it was 2 months. NO ONE should be expecting to go on a trip like this when you literally JUST started dating. Look at his jealousy and consider if you want to deal with this in the future.\n\nI hope you have a fantastic trip with your friend!!!!!!", "3 weeks is a LOOOOONG time to be traveling with someone you\u2019ve only been with for a few months. Adding a 3rd party to that is the recipe for disaster and will surely take away from the experience you are going for. It definitely wouldn\u2019t be fair to Alex.  As a side note though, there\u2019s a tone in your post I can\u2019t quite put my finger on, but I get vibes that you don\u2019t even really like Ezra all the much.", "I think you are completely in the right to not invite him. However he is in the right to feel upset. I am not sure how you communicated this with him. However if you explained clearly the significance of this trip and reasons why then it is what it is. He'll have to learn to deal with it. You don't always have to do things together, and I wonder if he'll be reacting this way if Alek was female.   \n\n\nI know others have asked but depending on how long you've been together might also factor in on also why be upset. He might interpret you not wanting to share this with him as something more. But again, there are things/experiences that you do not have to share. Friends have things that they want to do solely together and this is clearly something that is one of them. Especially since it is something that Alek and you have wanted to do for a very long time and prior to you dating your bf.", "NTA- 3 Months is nothing. Hell, you've probably been planning this trip longer than you two have been together. Yes, you are being a little crass, BUT also this is your first time visit to something that has a deep historical context for you and your friends family. \n\nIf he is being jealous now of a lifelong friend going on a trip about shared family history. Not going to the beach and having drinks. Imagine how he'll be in 6 months. A year.", "NAH.  It's just a question of different commitment levels.  Your boyfriend is serious about you, and you're not serious about him.  You have indicated that to him by making this decision, which is why he's upset.  Go ahead and end this relationship, it's unkind to string him along.", "Your NTA, but neither is your boyfriend, If you dont like him enough to have given him a heads up or ask about it, you probably dont like him enough to date him. Thats totally fine, and not a slight on your part at all, but its just a sign that you and this Ezra guy probably arent compatible. If you have known him for 8 months and he doesnt feel confident about you going on a trip with another dude, and you didnt feel the need to give him a heads up in planning it or invite him along, then it seems like its just not the best relationship for either of you", "NTA.  Like you\u2019ve tried to explain to him, this isn\u2019t a trip to Disneyland, it\u2019s more like a pilgrimage for you and your friend, you don\u2019t want some guy you\u2019ve been with for a few months whinging and whining about what he wants to do and not \u201cgetting\u201d what you\u2019re both trying to achieve.\n\nLike everyone M has said he has a right to feel left out and sad to be left for 3 weeks, but surely he\u2019s a big boy and can accept that sometimes people have to leave town for a bit.  Would he still be insufferable if you had to leave for 3 weeks to look after an ill relative?", "This sounds like less of a 'I want to know your background and heritage, teach me' and more of a \"I don't like you travelling with another guy\". If you're expected to bring him BUT HE DOESN'T EVEN GO WITH YOU TO THINGS LIKE MUSEUMS AND THE THINGS YOU TWO ARE DOING THEN WHAT'S THE POINT? Something like this is an all or mothing kind of thing. It's not like the two of you are going skiiing or anything. You're literally going to see your history. And if he just wants to \"be there to be there\" then that's not celebrating you or your heritage or history. That's literally just being a baby till he gets what he wants.\n\nHe can either trust you, or sulk like a baby till you get back.", "Just another thing to add, I was dating a girl and things had been going similiar to what you and your boyfriend have been (couple months of not really being together, and then a couple of months of dating). While we were dating she told me that she had booked tickets to go visit family in europe with one of her friends (they also had been close family friends for quite a while) I knew that her family history meant a lot to her, and I was totally fine with her going, but was a little hurt that she planned a 1 month trip with another guy and didnt tell me anything about it. I voiced this to her and we had a great conversation about how she understood and she didnt mean to be dismissive towards me or anything. It really helped me feel better and I didnt have to feel like I was just a afterthought. She went on the trip and had a great time with her childhood friend.and I didnt have to worry. Anyways after the month in italy, she came back home, broke up with me 2 days later, and moved in with her childhood friend.", "Of course, I recognize the connection and emotional bond you and your friend share. This isn\u2019t a beach holiday. But take a moment to consider how you would feel if your SO went on a 3 week trip somewhere and didn\u2019t want you to come along. I also would be jealous and I think if you\u2019re honest with yourself you would be also, no matter the circumstances. NTA, you aren\u2019t obligated at all, but don\u2019t dismiss his emotions as petty.", "Why not just break up with him? From all that I\u2019ve read from your post and a few comments you\u2019ve made, it doesn\u2019t even seem like you really like him. I can tell you what\u2019s most likely going to happen if you don\u2019t dump him before this trip. He\u2019s going to annoy the shit out of you during your whole 3 week trip. He\u2019s going to bombard you with text/call/FaceTime, which will inevitably lead to fighting, and more than likely an overly dramatic break up. Which then you will be TA, because you\u2019ve unnecessarily brought relationship drama on a trip and ruined the trip for Alek.", "NTA because you\u2019ve only been together 3 months. If you had been together a year or more or if he had perhaps met your grandfather, I would vote differently. It\u2019s pretty crazy of him in my opinion to expect to be invited to a THREE WEEK LONG vacation after being together for such a short time. I\u2019ve been dating my boyfriend around the same amount of time and he also just went on a 3 week international trip (alone). I would have felt truly insane and overstepping so ridiculously hard to be like hi :) i want to come too :)", "NTA\n\n3 months is nothing. \n\nGo on your trip with your friend.", "NTA. Your trip is incredibly personal and meaningful and I think you have every right not to invite someone not connected to the people & places you intend to visit. As well intentioned as Ezra may be, this doesn\u2019t seem like a trip for him if that\u2019s your preference. I personally would not like to go on this sort of trip with someone I didn\u2019t have a serious commitment to. If you break up, your memories of this very meaningful trip will include an ex boyfriend!", "NTA. Is your boyfriend truly going to want to be on a trip with you that has nothing to do with vacation spots or romance? No. This is not some fun, exciting adventure. This will be you retracing roots and a dark time in your family history. If you are still a couple years in the future, you can do the trip again as a family.", "You've been together for 3 months & he wants to go on holiday with you?\nTBH - I wouldn't want to go on holiday with someone I'd been going out with fir 3 months, no matter where the trip was!\n   \nI think NTA, for me, like I said, too soon, especially since, like you said, it's not a vacation type of trip. Its likely to get emotional, for both you & Alek, and your bf would be a spare wheel.\n  \nI can understand him being upset that you're going without him, but he needs to put his big boy pants on & deal with it. If you & Alek were more than friends, I'm sure something would've happened before now.\n  \nI also understand him wanting to share the experience with you, but there's plenty of time for the two of you to do a similar trip, when you've been together longer.\n  \nTell your bf that you understand his concern & reassure him that the 2 of you are just fine & that you'll go there with him at a suitable time. Tell him stories of you grandfather & family when you can. Stay in touch while you are away. Make sure you notice how you feel about bfs behaviour, imparticular any uncomfortable feeling & don't ignore them!\n   \nTake the trip with Alek, find your history & heritage, connect to the events of the past. Have a wonderful time & bring back amazing memories & photos you can share with bf & anyone else whose interested.", "INFO: How serious it your relationship with Ezra how long you been together?\nEdit: after reading comments I say NTA. He wouldn\u2019t appreciate the meaning at all.", "Sounds like you don't intend for him to be in your life long-term because if you did this would be a good bounding experience so he understands your family history.\nMy daughter did a similar trip with a friend from school and they still talk about it 20 years later. \nYour boyfriend will never have this bond because you didn't include him.\nMaybe you don't see a future with him.", "This is something you have to do with your friend. Ezra has to understand that he\u2019s your SO but he\u2019s not someone who needs to accompany you on this specific trip. You can take a trip with him at another time.", "NTA, this is a deeply personal trip for you and your friend. While I get your bf wants to join you, they should respect your need for privacy and to maybe not have to share this experience with someone who hasn\u2019t been directly affected as well.\n\nI wish you and your friend both the best for your trip!", "The biggest NTA I\u2019ve ever read.", "NTA. Your bf need to a) respect your wish and understand the trip isn\u2019t spring break holiday, it\u2019s an important pilgrimage to yours and Alex\u2019s grandfathers\u2019 home country, and b) he need to deal with his own jealousy and trust you. \n\nYou do not need to invite him, period.  If he doesn\u2019t understand the significance of the trip for you and Alex, then he have some growing up to do. And you are correct, you don\u2019t pander to a partner\u2019s jealousy.", "NAH .  You have every right wanting to go with your friend but agree with your friends that it\u2019s reasonable for your bf to be upset you want to take an emotional trip with another man, especially since he doesn\u2019t understand the bond you have.  It\u2019s ultimately your choice and something you and your bf will have to work through together.", "NTA. You've dated for 3 months? I wouldn't bring him either. You've known him for 5 months? Okay? You barely know the guy, lmao. \n\nI can understand the jealousy of going on a 3 week trip with another guy instead of your boyfriend, but jfc you've been dating 3 months. It would make sense if you guys were in a serious relationship. \n\nJust reassure him that your friend is only a friend, you guys have had this planned for long before you got together, and just stay in contact with him, ofc. \n\nLikely your boyfriend is afraid you will cheat on him or have something going on with the other guy, but that's because he's the new one coming into this. He doesn't understand the family type connection/bond whatever, which isn't necessarily his fault but you try to get him to understand. \n\nWhat I would do is this: do the trip as originally planned. Stay in contact, assure him nothing funny is going on. \nPromise him just the two of you, will make a similar trip soon enough so you can explain, educate, whatever else the stuff to him. \n\nI don't mean to sound crude here, but simply put, you have been dating for 3 months, known each other for 5 months. You don't owe him anything. \n\nIt'll be hard on the bf to get over it, but he will once you're back.", "NTA\n\nThis man is barely your BF and he's throwing tantrums like this? I highly doubt you will be together by the time this wonderful trip takes place if this is how he's behaving so early on in the relationship. Ignore him and have a wonderful time!", "NAH. Neither of you is wrong for feeling the way you do. 3 months isn\u2019t very long but you are a couple, after all (and have known each other and been seeing each other casually for longer; you didn\u2019t just meet 3 months ago). 3 months is long enough to feel invested in building a deeper bond with someone. If you can see the relationship having longevity, it\u2019s reasonable to want to go on a trip with someone even that early. \n\nI do think it would be important to emphasise that this is about family history, not a romantic trip, and you absolutely don\u2019t want Alek to feel like a third wheel, so it won\u2019t be super couply-couply and might be a tad awkward at times with a third person around and therefore Ezra might not prefer it and you won\u2019t be tolerating behaviour that makes Alek feel excluded. There might be a few excursions that you\u2019d rather go with just Alek too. You can try and have some couple time too but only when Alek has other things to do, so you might pick out things he would enjoy and you two wouldn\u2019t so each of you can get some \u2018you\u2019 time.", "NTA \nI brought my boyfriend of two years on a big family trip (once-in-lifetime thing, although not significant in the way OP trip is) and we broke up 2 years later. I kind of regret it, with him being in all the pictures and I felt during the trip I had to take care of him and couldn\u2019t fully enjoy the family time that should have been associated to the trip.\nWith the goal of the trip, I understand you not wanting your fairly recent boyfriend to come along. And although I get why he could feel insecure regarding you going with a male friend, if he trusts you it shouldn\u2019t bother him that much.\nAll that said, communication is important and how you presented things clearly makes a big difference.", "NTA.\n\nA 3-month boyfriend throwing a jealousy fit over a trip like this is a red flag. Especially since he's the one who was seeing other people during your casual phase. Talk about projection.", "NTA i think in the context you described you are not an AH. I assume there is no romantic history with Alek. I dont think its that unusual to sometimes take trips with friends without an SO and the purpose of the trip you describe is really specific and explains why its a trip you want to specifically do with Alek. \n\nI can understand Ezra feeling sad and wanting to go. But i dont think that makes you an asshole.", "If you had been in a long term relationship with him I would have said take him and let him share your family memories. As you've only been with him 3 months ( I've had bar crawls last longer) I would say no you are not the ahole as your relationship is still in very early stages and your friendship with Alek the strongest factor in all of this. Don't give in to him as for a 3 month relationship he's being very clingy and demanding. Red flag alert", "I agree with your friends\u2014NTA for wanting to go on a trip with your close friend. But sounds like you\u2019re being dismissive of Ezra\u2019s feelings.", "NTA, but don\u2019t be surprised if boyfriend leaves you.  I\u2019d break up with my girlfriend the day she left to go on a trip with another man this early in a relationship.  Life is too short to deal with stuff like this even with nuanced circumstances.  So NTA, but naive if you expect this relationship to last.", "I mean I think it'd be worse to invite him but then tell him \"stay in the hotel for now because I want to do this with Alek.\" \n\nESH\n\nCome on, OP. \n\nYou're going to be gone for almost a month. \n\nYou basically said \"it's none of your business\" - of course that's hurtful. \n\nI also think it's kind of insensitive of you to brush him off with \"stop being irrationally jealous.\"\n\nUhhhh it's not irrational? \n\nYou told him to his face that he can't be apart of your trip because \"you're not one of us.\" \n\nI'd be like \"well damn\" too lol.\n\nHowever, y'all are a baby couple lol. It is BOLD of him to insist he be invited on a trip that predates him even being in the picture. \n\nAnd to be truthful - I think it'd be rude to Alek to all of a sudden be like \"and my bf is coming so buckle up.\" \n\n**What I would do**: \n\nI'd tell him that if he really wants to learn more about you and your grandfather then maybe you two could go together in a few months in your own separate trip. \n\nI'd also offer to help brainstorm a completely separate trip for just you and him that has nothing to do with either of your heritages. .", "NTA - If you'd been dating for a year or more you'd probably feel differently about including him but after only 3 months his entitlement may be a red flag. Have an amazing trip with your BFF. Be honest with yourself if there is something \"more\" going on with your guy friend Alek. Not for Ezra's sake but just for your own awareness.", "NTA, you're trying to heal deep family trauma. That's not something you take your newest love interest to. You'd have to fill him in on every family story the entire time, nulling the point of the trip, which is to understand your grandfather and his struggle better. \n\nHonestly I'd dump him so you don't have to deal with that drama during this very important trip. \n\nBare in mind that healing trauma like this will likely draw you closer to your family friend, and may eventually result in evolving your relationship. This could eventually result in romance which might not be a bad thing. \n\nI wish you all the best on your trip. I know it will be hard. Update us later on please", "Here's what i'm getting from all the comments.\n\n3 months is nothing for a new relationship! do what you like! \n\nAnd\n\nHe should trust you, and if he can't he's just insecure and jealous! \n\nSo the length of the relationship is short enough that she shouldn't care about his feelings on the matter, but he should trust her without question? This is OP half arsing the relationship because it's new and getting annoyed because he isn't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEzra's problem is definitely more to do with going alone with a male friend than anything else, but he probably knows he can't say that as you're already treating his feelings like they mean absolutely nothing to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople who are talking about trust like it starts at 100% and should never fall below it are insane. Trust isn't something you should expect regardless of your actions. Trust is built over time and constantly reinforced through your actions. Once you're in a committed relationship you should honestly stop spending ( with some exceptions) 1 on 1 time with \"friends\" of the opposite sex out of respect for your relationship. That's how trust is built. Acting like you can do whatever you want and expect to be trusted no matter what you do is a shaming tactic used by a lot of people who are up to no good. Do people really believe it's respectful to organize a trip with a member of the opposite sex for 3 weeks without discussing it with their partner first? Only being with someone for 3 months is a disgusting excuse to disregard the feelings of your partner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWanting to do this trip with Alek isn't the problem. It clearly had meaning for both of you. It's the attitude you have with regards to how Ezra will naturally feel about it. You don't consider his feelings to be important or valid, and for that YTA. And if you have any kind of history with Alek AT ALL, you absolutely shouldn't be going alone with him while in a relationship without it being discussed with your SO before anything has been decided.", "NTA.  3 / 5 months is still a very new relationship.

My opinion.", "It is clear you guys haven't been together very long and are still trying to figure out rather you both are ready for relationships at this point. I'm 37 and I remember a time were couples use to date with the intent of marriage. Relationships we're built with love, patience, understanding, permanence. This new age quasi relationship doesn't leave much room for understanding. \n\nNo man or woman has ever been ok with their significant other going away for prolonged periods of time, especially in the infancy of their relationship. At that point you guys should be still ga ga over one another and wanting to spend every waking moment together. The fact this isn't the case makes me wonder if something else happened and you are just viewing this relationship as a time passer or not.\n\nLastly, it is jealousy, it is not controlling it's more of a matter of respect for one another. This generation get that confused a lot.", "NTA he\u2019s gotta put more work into the relationship to get the honor of being considered", "Three months?

Last month, on the anniversary of my grandfather\u2019s death, Alek and I began discussing taking a trip to my grandfather\u2019s birth country, and other places associated with their lives. We decided to take the trip for three weeks early next year. \n\nMy boyfriend \u201cEzra\u201d is mad that I didn\u2019t invite him. I told him this was a trip about my and Alek\u2019s family history, and something we wanted to do together to connect with our heritage, it\u2019s not a resort vacation. He said he is hurt that I don\u2019t want to share this with him. I keep telling him this isn\u2019t chicken nuggets and I don\u2019t want to share, this is something that just patently doesn\u2019t include him and something I just want to do with Alek, and he\u2019s being irrationally jealous. \n\nFriends I\u2019ve spoken to say I absolutely have the right to go, but they don\u2019t blame him for being hurt that I want to go travelling with another guy. They say I should maybe invite him for a few days if the trip and if I don\u2019t want him to come to specific places that\u2019s fine but I should find a way to include him on the trip. I don\u2019t think I should have to invite him just to pander to his jealousy and fomo. \n\nAITA for not inviting him?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Go for it and don\u2019t give a second thought about not inviting Ezra as this trip sounds way more important to you as a person than Ezra - who most definitely would change the entire vibe of the trip. \n\nYou\u2019ve made that choice - and it sounds like the right choice for you right now. Just realize that you\u2019re effectively breaking up with Ezra with this decision. And that\u2019s ok. This trip is clearly more important to you than pandering to Ezra\u2019s feelings.\n\nOf course Ezra is upset. Partly because you\u2019re traveling for 3 weeks with another guy. While understandable, this points more to pure jealousy and lack of trust in you and your relationship. MANY relationships would not withstand this - especially new ones. (I personally think that\u2019s BS and unfounded jealousy is extremely toxic, but that\u2019s pretty outside the norm).\n\nMore importantly, you\u2019re going on a the most meaningful personal and emotional quest in your life and you\u2019re explicitly excluding your bf. While I completely understand and support your reasoning, of course Erza wants to be there with you. It would be an incredibly bonding experience and the two of you would likely emerge closer than ever before. But you don\u2019t want that. With him. You want that with Alek. \n\nEzra knows the emotional connection you\u2019re deliberately excluding him from and feels awful to be excluded from that. That\u2019s quite understandable.\n\nBut it\u2019s also understandable why you want to experience that with Alek instead of Ezra. And that\u2019s ok. But in choosing to share this deeply intimate experience with Alek instead of Ezra, you\u2019re effectively choosing Alek over Ezra, so don\u2019t expect him to be there when you get back. \n\nIn fact, given your mindset and his reaction, it may be better to just break up or put your relationship on hold until you can reevaluate it after this trip. This might even open up the possibility of potentially rethinking your relationship with Alek after just an intensely, emotionally bonding journey if that could be an option.", "Idk abt y\u2019all, but i wouldn\u2019t be okay with my S/O going on a 3 week vacation with someone of the opposite gender, alone.

Also I doubt he is even wanting to go because of what the trip is, he wants to go because he doesn\u2019t trust you with your life long friend. This already doesn\u2019t seem healthy to me.

Thats incredibly selfish and insecure. \nThree months is no time at all, and saying if you wanna think about the long term with him, like no. Theres other ways to bond.

You haven't even been dating that long. Even if you had been, it's okay to have areas of your life separate from him. You're allowed to take trips with friends who are not him. I would suggest talking it out with him and asking why he's so jealous/upset over this. Is it purely jealousy and him being insecure over your relationship (possibly due to past experiences, or ingrained beliefs that he's unlovable and thus you won't stay?)? Does he feel unappreciated in the relationship and it came out in an unfortunately charged way when a big event triggered those feelings for him? If he can communicate with you why he's acting this way, you can figure out compromises (ex. a date night or a specific activity to do with him) and reassure him of his worth to you that being said, a long term friend with such history should be worth more than a new boyfriend, and if he can't accept that, he has problems he needs to sort out. If he can't even address and express why he is feeling this way or understand why it's irrational, I personally wouldn't be able to stay in this relationship if I was in your shoes. If my partner ever stopped trusting me around other guys (provided I'm not flirting/cheating/etc. - that would justify it), I'd break up with him and question why he's even dating me if he thinks I can't be trusted.", "NAH. I think it's totally fair to do this trip with a longtime friend versus a recent boyfriend. But I also think it's fair to be unhappy that your significant other is going on a trip with someone of the opposite gender and specifically doesn't want to involve you in this emotionally.\n\nAgain, fair that you don't want to involve him, but not surprising that he would be a little hurt or at least concerned. It's reasonable for it hurt to find out that you want to be more involved in your partner's life than they want you to be.

You do not want to travel with Ezra - you want to travel with Alek. Ezra does not share the connection with the place. His jealousy is not irrational.\n\nIt is obvious why Ezra is going to be jealous and you're absolutely uncaring of why. You want to take the meaningful trip with someone who it will also have deep meaning for. Ezra needs to spend a little more time working to understand why you might now want to go. Everyone involved has reasonable opinions. No one is specifically being an asshole and you're literally navigating being in a relationship. It really would not be surprising if when you return from your trip, you\u2019ll have learned and experienced a lot with Alek - but you will be single.

There is nothing irrational about feeling jealous here, and to be so dismissive of his feelings will only make it worse.

That\u2019s just something he has to work out for himself because he\u2019s being an idiot.

Have a further talk with your partner but be more open to inviting him, acknowledge that you know he wants to be there for you and go from there.

You don't have to play tour guide and you can set clear boundaries and expectations for the trip and his involvement, but if this is as important part of your life as you make it out to be and you also want your boyfriend to be invested in you, your life and your heritage than you would be the AH and quite frankly not very smart to exclude him from this.", "After seeing some of OP's comments, YTA. \n\nMy gut reaction when I first read this was OP is NTA because I can't pretend to understand the kind of trauma that comes with surviving the Holocaust and the generational trauma that family members inherit. OP's and Alek's family share an incredible bond no doubt and it's going to be a personal and emotional trip for the two of them to take. I don't think OP should have to explain everything to Ezra if he were to go on the trip as that would take away from the experience for OP and Alek. \n\nDespite that, it is understandable that Ezra would feel left out and insecure, not necessarily because he's jealous of Alek, but because he's not in a place yet in his relationship where they can share this level of emotional intimacy, and probably feels that his SO has better emotional intimacy with Alek. I think downgrading that to just some kind of possessive jealousy is unfair.\n\nSeeing what OP has been saying in comments has kind of sealed the deal for me. They seem to not care how Ezra feels and the worst part is, doesn't think he's entitled to his emotions. How OP is treating him is probably making him get more insecure and be more childish about the situation, because OP won't even acknowledge that this could be difficult for him. \n\nOP should be able to take this trip without he BF but doesn't get to dismiss his feelings about it. I'm guessing OP started planning this trip without even talking to Ezra, not to ask his permission but to be up front and honest so he feels somewhat in the loop. OP doesn't have to be ready to share their family trauma with their BF, but they can still be considerate of his feelings, especially if they someday want to be able to share this stuff with him. Sounds to me like that isn't going to happen because OP was asked repeatedly the length of the relationship and if they saw a future but never saw any responses on that from OP yet, probably because the answer isn't a truth OP is ready to face. It would still be nice to know for context the length of the relationship but honestly, at any stage, you have to communicate and be considerate of your SO's feelings, it's just that the longer the relationship is, the worse the OP seems.\n\nEdit: Saw that OP added how long they've been dating.

It's deeply personal to you both in ways that nobody but you and your families can understand and Ezra's deranged insistence about being included in this is seriously off putting.
