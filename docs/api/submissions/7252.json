So me and my roommate (both 27M) hosted a party. We both invited our friends to it. He is currently hooking up with a girl named Caroline. She showed up with two of her friends Tara and Sasha. I had no problem with Caroline or Sasha being there but I do have a issue with Tara and I will explain why. \n\nSo whenever we first moved to the city I was friends with my roommate and the 3 girls. We went out together and it was a fun little group. We were all 24ish whenever we first met. Me and Tara became friends and then started to text more individually. Eventually I discussed going on a date. It became this whole like confrontational thing with her. I don\u2019t know her past but she was incredibly difficult. She stated she only wanted to meet up during the day and in a public place. No alcohol or anything like that either. I was like okay that\u2019s fine. Then she stated  numerous times about how we weren\u2019t gonna hookup. So if that was my intention then don\u2019t get my hopes up. I again was like okay lol. She kept on saying that she\u2019s not like that and then she started making jokes about me being a serial killer and asking if I was gonna kill her on our date. She also made a few negative comments about men/dating. I was fed up about it and just done. I didn\u2019t feel the need to keep defending myself. So I didn\u2019t respond. We never ended up going on the date and we faded out. No big deal imo. \n\nI didn\u2019t see her for while due to Covid.  But the next time I saw her was back in late 2021. We were all out drinking together. I ended up going home with a girl that was part of the group. While sitting on this girls couch she shows me DMs from Tara saying how I\u2019m a creep and other stuff. She also said this exactly\u2026 \u201cI\u2019ve heard from some girls he has a small \ud83c\udf64 if you know what I mean girl\u201d. I saw the dms will my own eyes. Afterwords I left all the group chats she was involved with. Told my roommate and he stopped talking to her too. We told her friends that we just didn\u2019t wanna hangout with them anymore. \n\nSo whenever she showed up to my party it was shocking. I didn\u2019t want her there. But Caroline is banging my friend so i didn\u2019t want to have to start shit. So I asked her to leave quickly. She did without saying much. Her friends did not leave and stayed most of the night. I found out later that she sat in our apartment lobby for an hour waiting on them. But her friends didn\u2019t come and she  ended up getting a ride home. Which is stupid because she could have ordered an Uber immediately. Her friends claim they didn\u2019t know she got kicked out by me. And are calling me an AH because my roommate said she could come. He said he did say that but forgot about how much I didn\u2019t like her and said he had no issue with me kicking her out. He apologized to me and said he totally forgot. And said just because her friends left her it wasn\u2019t my fault.

You did not make a scene, or say anything mean to her or about her.\n\nDid it suck that she waited an hour in the lobby? Yeah, but you didn't tell her to wait.  As you said, she very easily could have gotten an uber home. \n\nHonestly, sounds like Tara has some issues she needs to speak to a therapist about.  She's definitely an AH for spreading lies about you.\n\nNTA, and cool that your roommate was so good about the situation as well.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your place, you can boot someone from a party. But your friend kinda is TA for saying she could come in the first place. At least it sounds like he recognizes that and has apologized. \n\nIt does suck for her, because maybe she couldn't afford a lyft/uber and was kinda stuck there. But that's not your fault. If her friends are upset with you it might be because *she's* upset with *them* for not checking their phones when she was waiting for them. That is also not your fault.", "NTA\n\nYour friend needed to tell you she was coming. She made her own bed and drama", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes! I'm amazed she had the gall to show up to your house party knowing what she'd said about you behind your back.", "NTA. Tara took her obvious trauma and dropped it all on you.You wisely dipped out and in retaliation she slandered you with the friend group. Then she has the nerve to come to your house after all that! She's also a drama queen. Who waits for a hour hoping someone noticed she wasn't there? Did she *really* wait an hour? Why didn't she call/text her friends to let them know the situation? It's also very telling that the people she went with didn't even know she left. She's a proven liar and messy as hell so everything she says/texts is suspect and to be taken with a grain of salt.", "NTA you get to decide who you will and will not host", "NTA. You asked her to leave. You didn't throw her out into the snow, she was in the lobby. She could have let her friends know she was leaving and (to her credit because she didn't), caused a big scene.

Also that\u2019s what she deserved for being a crappy person", "NTA\n\nShe should've gone to her friends before leaving to let them know. The fact they ditched her isn't your fault. They think you're being mean because they've heard her side of the story and they didn't want to be inconvenienced, and so they're putting the blame on you instead of accepting their responsibility. \n\nYour roommate also has partial blame here, because he was the one who invited her knowing yalls history. \n\nBut not you. You're in the clear.", "NTA.\nShe could have asked ahead of time if it might be an issue for her to come to your place after your ghosting. Talking aside to her to let her know why her presence here wasn't a good idea was a good move, no reason to make it a big thing. She didn't get an Uber but also didn't text her friends in the party to ask for a ride back home? That sounds strange, possibly manipulative. Because it's your house you can decide who is and isn't welcome, but next time try to be on the same page as tour roommate.", "NTA\n\nYour house, your rules.  She was very nasty to you behind your back for no reason and its not unreasonable to not want her in your house at your party.  She got there on her own she can get home on her own its not up to you to sort out a lift for her.  \n\nIt probably speaks volumes about her that her friends didn't notice she wasn't there anymore.", "NTA - the audacity of her to turn up knowing full well she chatted shit about you.", "INFO: How did you cause her to sit outside for over an hour?", "Info: she got legs right?", "NTA.  I am surprised she'd even come in the 1st place.  After what she said about OP, I wouldn't want her at my party either.\n\nSounds like the roommate messed up.  He owned it and apologized for it - so there really shouldn't be any issue here.\n\nFor her to sit in the lobby for an hour is on her.  Like everyone else has pointed out, she was free to call an Uber or taxi or friend - whatever.  She didn't - and I wouldn't feel bad.", "YTA.\n\nThis is all very petty - but your real problem is with your roommate. Your roommate invited Tara. Tara came because she was an invited guest by a resident of the home. \n\nYou kicked her out by herself, knowing that she didn\u2019t come alone. Many girls don\u2019t like to ride Ubers at night alone because it can be a safety concern.\n\nYou kicked her out without confirming with your roommate, who invited her. \n\nI don\u2019t think you did the right thing here. The conflict is actually between you and your roommate because they invite people you hate to your home and then put you in this position. \n\nThis was handled in a way that was unkind to an invited guest. It would be different if she wasn\u2019t invited.  Furthermore, it just gives her more ammo to talk crap about you now.  how you kicked a girl out in the middle of the night, by herself, when she was invited to your home.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

OP talked to Tara at the beginning of the party so it was maybe 10pm at the latest so that's no where near the middle of the night. Tara had no business showing up in someone's home that she had slandered to the friend group. \n\nSo what if it's petty, he lives there so why should OP be uncomfortable *in his own home* to a hanger on. Tara wasn't really invited, her friends asked the roommate if she could come. I'll agree that the roommate was inconsiderate in allowing her presence in his home. However, life is too short and precious to put up with jerks you don't share any type of genetic connection. How come *her* friends didn't know that she was gone for *the whole night*? Tara was just stirring shit and got mad she got splashed.", "But OP did not know his roommate invited her until after the fact, how is he the AH for not wanting her there?\n\nHe kicked her out but it\u2019s not like he confiscated her phone. Does texting not exist? Or calling? She can\u2019t communicate with her friends in some way? She just\u2026, expected them to realize she wasn\u2019t there and come find her in the lobby? \n\nI believe the roommate default rule is \u201cif it\u2019s not a yes from both of us it\u2019s a no.\u201d Should he have filed a formal request for removal and gotten it notarized With roommate approval before presenting it to her? \n\nWhat is the right thing? Let a woman who: agreed in principal to a date. With someone she knew in both a group and Individual setting and was willing to drink around in those group settings. But then I guess decides he\u2019s not a good guy? Asks for a lot of specific requirements (that OP agrees to right away and she has every right to feel safe) then starts calling him a serial killer and a lot of \u201call guys only want sex,\u201d which OP already agreed was off the table. So he drops the date, which I guess to her confirmed all her worst fears because he didn\u2019t defend himself the 10th (or whatever number) time she brought it up. BUT, is ok with still seeing him in group settings? Like wtf? THEN tried to sabotage a hookup with a girl who left willingly with him. I wouldn\u2019t have let her into my apt either! Also, WHY would she go to the apt of a person she thinks is this terrible? It makes no sense at all that she would do that after all the previous interactions.\n\nAll this to say your judgement is based on OP knowing his roommate invited her.

I'm glad that you have never had a toxic friend. They are exhausting and like to \"test\" your loyalty just Tara's shenanigans with her waiting in the lobby for an hour. *So she said*.
