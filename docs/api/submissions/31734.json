For context, I legitimately told him to go to his families without me. He had options. He chose to go with me and be miserable apparently. You'll have to excuse me because I'm honestly feeling enraged currently so everything I say is going to sound mean. Yes, I love him. Yes, I want him to be happy. But right now, no, I don't care.\n\nSo, for the past 6 years I have been absolutely jipped on holidays. Every single Christmas and every single Thanksgiving, we spend it with his family. The one time I saw my family on \"Thanksgiving\" was only because my mom ended up celebrating 3 days later than the actual holiday and that was 5 years ago. But, I had a baby 5 weeks ago. His family has already proven to be disrespectful (his mom and sister both said they weren't exposed to anything or sick so they could come see the baby and we found out later it was a lie but it was \"no big deal\" and we needed to \"get over it\"). I wasn't willing to go to their Thanksgiving because I don't trust them around my kid. My family is huge on respect. They post weeks in advance saying if you are sick or exposed, stay home and that there are babies around, etc etc and everyone listens. Therefore, out of 30 ppl invited to my mom's Thanksgiving, 8 people showed up. \n\nBut maybe an hour in to dinner with my family my fianc\u00e9 goes quiet and keeps stepping outdoors to use the phone. When I finally ask him whats wrong, he tells me that he is bummed out that our baby isn't spending her first thanksgiving with his family because \"you know how important Thanksgiving is to me and my family\". Several times he asked me if we could swing by his families house. I kept telling him no and that I was enjoying a year with my family but he's more than welcome (I strictly breastfeed so he couldn't take the baby). He said he wouldn't go without me and in turn, sat in the corner of the room pouting for 4+ hours. Later on he said that he was disappointed that I didn't care that he didn't see his family on Thanksgiving and I kind of snapped and said \"you're right, I don't care. I haven't seen my family on any holiday for 5 years and you don't care about that so no.\" He says I'm an AH for downplaying his feelings over a holiday that \"doesn't mean anything\" to me, apparently.\n\nETA: he doesn't like hanging out with my family because they \"have no structure\". We just hang out and shoot the breeze.
