I'd have lost my mind and left in the middle of the night if I had to deal with that circus.", "YTA. It's very very clear that your gf is nowhere near as important as your family. Your gf's boundaries obviously mean nothing to you. I think she's looking for a partner that is willing to stand up for her or even sympathize a little. Why didn't you show your support of your own gf by taking off WITH her. It's very apparent that when your family is around, is the entire brood vs your gf and you're doing absolutely nothing to mitigate it. Just break up with her if she hasn't done it already. Are you too afraid to call out any member of your family?", "ESH / NAH for me. This is a fundamental compatibility difference but your response wasn't great and her ignoring your family is also not great. Some families are like this and embrace this method, others like more solitary existences. I am ***not*** a morning person so while I could handle and wouldn't even mind the talking, the dog thing, yeah that's a no for me. I love dogs, but I hate mornings. I could do one or the other but not both issues.", "YTA she should leave not before telling Jackue to shut the f up. What a sad parody of a boyfriend you are being.", "YTA After the first night I would have bailed and gotten a hotel where you'd both be more comfortable. Putting her through all of that and then asking her not to embarrass you, dude you are already an embarrassment, that ship has sailed.", "YTA, she's absolutely right. Jackie needs to learn boundaries, and getting woken up at prematurely at 5am by unwelcomed people and animals barging into your room would get annoying. Your gf is being very gracious by removing herself from the situation and not saying anything in front of your family.", "YTA\n\nYou fully admitted in a comment that you have done nothing to address the dogs or Jackie harassing your girlfriend day in and day out. Your girlfriend is very understandably frustrated.\n\nBut instead of rocking the boat you rather tell your girlfriend to grin and bear it.", "YTA. That sounds like hell, I'm amazed that she's put up for it as long as she has. Holy crap dude. And you're worried about *her* embarrassing *you*?", "YTA\n\nHonestly, I'd be mad with my family and friends for embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend. You should also be embarrassed at yourself for not doing anything to avoid your girlfriend from being waken up in the morning or being harassed by Jackie all day long.", "YTA. Your girlfriend is overwhelmed because she is overstimulated. That\u2019s why she\u2019s behaving this way. All you have to do is ensure she has some space in the day - you deal with your family regarding the dogs, explaining you mean it, or lock the door at night or whatnot, with Jackie you step in and redirect Jackie away from GF. Bring your GF coffee in bed so she can get ready in peace. She\u2019s hit her limit, she\u2019s expressed it, and all you do is tell her to shut up and deal with it and not embarrass you. \n\nOverstimulation is biologically based, it varies for each person, and she has hit her threshold. She is communicating that to you. FIX IT, don\u2019t blame her. It isn\u2019t even that hard a fix! \n\nHere is a simple to do list for you to help her: \n1. Give her designated alone time each day or time with just you (for me it\u2019d be when I wake up and before bed). Like an hour or *whatever she states she needs*. Maybe the first day she needs the whole day given her current level of being worked up. She needs to decompress and she needs less sensory input to do so (aka people!). \n2. During that time you gracefully handle your family - simply explain she is taking a rest, make sure dogs and Jackie stay away, make sure you\u2019re available to fetch her food and water from the kitchen. Ensure that your family doesn\u2019t look down on her/hold it against her. \n3. The results of the above 2 actions: Her responses/behavior will change. \n\n\nPS your family is large not medium lol", "YTA. In your own words she is woken up at 5/6am and is then \u201ccornered\u201d by Jackie and this has been going on for days. Any reasonable person would be at the end of their rope. I notice you never even mention trying anything to improve the situation. If I was her you would be gone the second we return from the trip.", "Yta. You and your family are so in the wrong. Your gf has much more patience than I would", "YTA. It's one thing to grin and bear it when the family is a bit louder or a bit more boisterous than you are used to,  but your family is over the top and none of them are doing a damn thing to make your GF feel welcome,  in fact,  y'all are doing the exact opposite!\n\nAlso,  what does Jackie being trans have to do with it? Rude is rude,  trans or cis. No one wants to be held hostage to someone else's monologue. \n\nOr are y'all just relieved that Jackie is yammering nonstop at someone else for once?", "YTA.  Why are you not intervening when you're girlfriend is being cornered by your family and/or family friends forcing her into endless self-indulgent conversations about themselves?  Or their dogs waking her up at the ass-crack of dawn?  These are your friends and family - deal with them and let them know you expect them to act appropriately.  And instead you accuse her of embarrassing you and swear at her?!?  WTF is wrong with you?  This isn't how you treat a guest in your home - by making her uncomfortable and then threatening and swearing at her as if SHE is the problem.\n\nI'm glad she seems to have the self-respect to realize she should break up with someone who has so little regard or respect for her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

GF has met my parents multiple times but hasn't met anyone else in the family and everyone was going to be here. We were given the downstairs guest bedroom. I guess this was an eye opener for me as to how my GF is. I already knew she wasn't big on crowds but I didn't expect it to go like this.\n\nSo, my family is semi-large I guess. I have 4 siblings. They all have kids. I then have my 3 aunts and 2 uncles and their significant others. And there are 2 family friends here. One is my sister's best friend and the other is a mTf transgender \"Jackie\" that I've known since LONG before her transition (back when she was married to her wife/mother of her children). I've noticed that most of my GFs issue is with Jackie. Not for any other reason aside from her being extremely invasive and will follow you around engaging you in 20 different conversations at once and doesn't exactly know boundaries. She just never, ever stops talking honestly. And between her and the family dogs, my GF is becoming like.. pissed almost. \n\nSo basically every morning when we wake up (being woken up by the dogs because the door is busted and they come in the room to jump on us at 5-6am) we will go out to get coffee and Jackie immediately corners my GF to engage her in conversation. To a point where my GF has been looking at me in the morning and saying \"get the fucking dogs out of here\" and if I asked if she wants coffee, it's a \"I'd rather not be ear r*ped as soon as I wake up, thanks\". And now, whenever Jackie comes near us or to our doorway to talk, my GF has been \"checking out\" and refuses to even look at Jackie. She will turn the other way, for instance. It's embarrassing. We are only here a few more days so I told her \"you better not embarrass me. Please suck it the fuck up for 3 more days\". She immediately snapped at me and told me that she's put up with this \"BS\" for over a week and when we get back home she's considering leaving because \"she can't be with someone with a family so fucking invasive. Who tf talks someone's ear off from 6am to 11pm every fucking night?\". She also went off about the disrespect because they don't even try to prevent the dogs from waking us up. They laugh it off. So I said \"Do what you want but don't fucking embarrass me when we are here.\" She's been taking off during the day and won't answer my calls/texts.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You should block the door or something, saying busted isnt a good enough excuse IMO. \n\n>She also went off about the disrespect because they don't even try to prevent the dogs from waking us up. They laugh it off.\n\nWow, if you cant recognise this as rude behaviour you are insensitive. \n\nIt seems you are more concerned with your appearance to your family than your partners concerns.", "YTA and your girlfriend has more patience than me. By the third day I would have barricaded the door so the dogs won't barge in and have politely told Jackie to please cease to talk.", "This situation sounds overwhelming, honestly.  Staying with your partner's family often feels awkward to me (I'm not a guest but I'm also not really 'family' the way I would be with my own relatives.)  Staying there an entire week with dogs waking you up at 5 a.m. and someone nattering at you from morning until night would have me checking out and looking bored/angry too.  I honestly think you're just better off to stay at a hotel and do the family in more managed doses in the future.  It may not feel this way because it's your family, but smiling through a week plus of this sounds like a lot to ask of any partner, and you're not just asking her to endure, you're asking her to put on a happy face and pretend she's having a good time too.

On top of nonstop noise from the dogs and your family, including in her private space, you\u2019ve engaged in verbal abuse. You should know her well enough to know this would be very challenging for her, and you should have arranged for more privacy and played interference for her at times to allow her to recover. If you didn\u2019t know, as soon as she communicated her stress to you, you should have adjusted to balance her needs with those of your family.

How dare you, I wasn't even there, but just reading what was going on stressed me out. \n\nBe grateful, bc honestly, many other people, myself included, would've snapped and hurt Jackie's feelings. I would've confronted her, or I would've left and went home or stayed in a hotel bc all of this was entirely too much, that's your family so clearly your used to it and can deal but it's not fair to expect others to just suck it up. \n\nI do hope she sticks to her guns and leaves, not because your family is invasive, but bc you did absolutely nothing to help make the situation better, but instead insulted her, now she knows you won't protect her, she can't trust you when it comes to your family and you will choose them over her.", "YTA. Wondering why u went into so much about your history w Jackie and Jackie's transgender status. Are u expecting tolerance for her lack of boundaries because of her gender status?

Otherwise, why include that piece of information that has nothing to do with the reasons why their gf is pissed off?\n\n*ETA: I misread the post when I first posted this.
