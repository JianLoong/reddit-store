If you, your kids and your wife are all agreeing with how everything is currently going at your home I don't see any problems.", "NTA.  Your kids are taken care of, emotionally and physically. You are treating them as whole human beings and raising independent thinkers instead of obedient little minions.  They support each other rather than tear each other down. This is how it\u2019s done.  Your in-laws don\u2019t have a say here and it\u2019s nice of you to consider their perspective but they aren\u2019t coming from a place of understanding.  If everyone in the family is satisfied with the current situation and needs are met, why mess with that?\n\nETA from what you\u2019ve described, you\u2019ve achieved a level of structure while also allowing them to have personal autonomy. Not enough adults have this. \n\nPlus If you change it now to please your in laws, how do you think that will go over with your kids?", "NTA. Honestly, it sounds fine to me? You seem to be giving them just enough leeway that they don't abuse it and create a comfortable family environment.", "While I think it's of course good that you're not recreating the punitive, informant-and-enforcer situation you experienced, I also think that your current approach is going to be confusing for the kids. \n\nYou don't need to encourage them to tattle or punish them for not doing so. But what you've described is that it's openly known that the rules don't need to be followed. \n\nOutside of the dysfunctional situation your parents created, kids usually tattle because it feels *unfair* to them that they have done the right thing and followed the rule and someone else hasn't, and that's a totally valid feeling. \n\nWhen you effectively say 'you have to follow the rules but it's also fine if someone else doesn't', you're kinda killing the structure that kids need and often *want*. Are they rules or not? Do they have to follow them or not? If it doesn't matter either way, why should they do it? \n\nThere's natural consequences, sure, but then your rules are just 'advice' which kids can be terrible at taking, and the only real rule is 'reap whatever consequences happen to come your way, and assess those as you wish'.\n\nThe kids shouldn't be feeling that they have to be enforcers on each other, but it's understandable for them to say so if they feel they've done the right thing and someone else is doing the wrong thing. \n\nIt's ok to teach young adults to make good choices and own them, and at the eldest's age that is what she should be doing, but I do wonder if *you* \\- not the kids - need to enforcing structure a bit more than you are for the younger two.", "NTA It sounds like you have a good system that suits your family, and you show you trust your kids. That is huge. My parents didn't get us to snitch but never believed I'd make good choices and were very controlling. If I did anything wrong they made it a huge deal right into my early 20s. The result was that I left home as soon as I could and made bad choices because I didn't trust myself - still find it difficult now.  nor could I go to them for help because I knew they'd just over-react. \nWhat many so-called strict parents forget is the long game. \n1. Reasonable rules with good explanations will mostly be obeyed. When they aren't, consequences teach a lot.\n2. As children grow older, they learn responsibility when given the opportunity to practice it - like all skills, it doesn't automatically appear.\n3. Sibling relationships can be a support network all their lives. These relationships need nurturing from young. They'll need each other when you're old and have to make all the decisions.\n4. Building trust with them means they can come to you when the real s*t goes down, and it will.\n\nYou and your wife are doing great. You are raising good adults who have a growth mindset.", "NTA, so long as your kids wouldn't cover for something like sneaking off to meet someone you're all good.", "NTA\n\nTheir long term bond as siblings is more important than minor rule breaking.
