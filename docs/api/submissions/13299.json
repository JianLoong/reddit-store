For some context, growing up my siblings and I were always told to enforce the house rules even if our parents weren't around. We'd even get rewarded if we helped our parents catch one of us breaking the rules. That meant that by the time we were teens, we were always on edge around eachother, and looking for any sign of rule breaking. We'd even get punished if they found out we knew and didn't tell, which made it worse. I'll admit I did it too, I was wrong to but that's not what this is about, though that does mean my sister is the only one that still speaks to me.\n\nOur policy (I discussed this with my wife long ago and she agrees) is this: So long as nobody is getting hurt physically or emotionally, they really don't need to tattle on eachother. We won't punish them if they do (unless they lie or are repetitive about it, this is mostly so they aren't scared to tell us if something is actually wrong) but they don't need to parent eachother. I also won't pretend like I'm proud one of them tells on the other using their phone late at night, because that isn't their job to police.\n\nFor example, my wife works nights, and I get called in usually once a week (we both work in healthcare) That means there's usually a few nights a month they have alone. Normal bedtime rules apply whether or not we're home, but it's an open secret that that doesn't happen. It's not at all uncommon that one of us gets home, and they all crawl out of bed or all happened to \"get up early\" they'll get the natural consequence of being tired at school. The only time we stepped in is when the youngest told us the others were being loud late, and kept her up.\n\nOverall it works great, they all adore and trust eachother to be their supports, and not our informants. The issue is my in-laws think we take this too far, and should at least encourage them to make eachother follow rule when we're gone. Keep in mind nobody is \"in charge\" when we're gone. The oldest two are old enough to be home alone, and the youngest is fine if they're there. They don't need to rat on eachother or enforce chores, that's our job. I do wonder though if we're being too leniant, and letting the kids run the house while we're gone, since that might give them authority issues when they get older.", "created_utc": 1679901455, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/123etj9/aita_for_not_encouraging_our_kids_to_snitch_on/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Everyone seems to be doing fine. It might be different if someone was sneaking out or doing drugs, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.", "NTA. Provide your kids with a loving and trusting environment and you\u2019ll usually be rewarded with loving and trustworthy kids. It seems like you\u2019re fostering a healthy and respectful relationship with yourselves and between your kids. No matter what your IL say, don\u2019t try to fix something that ain\u2019t broke.", "Love it. NTA. Kids need to learn that tattling doesn\u2019t get you anywhere sometimes and breaks the trust of others.", "NTA, it seems like you and your wife are on the same page about how you're raising your kids. Your in-laws may of course voice their opinion but not more than that. If you, your kids and your wife are all agreeing with how everything is currently going at your home I don't see any problems.", "NTA.  Your kids are taken care of, emotionally and physically. You are treating them as whole human beings and raising independent thinkers instead of obedient little minions.  They support each other rather than tear each other down. This is how it\u2019s done.  Your in-laws don\u2019t have a say here and it\u2019s nice of you to consider their perspective but they aren\u2019t coming from a place of understanding.  If everyone in the family is satisfied with the current situation and needs are met, why mess with that?\n\nETA from what you\u2019ve described, you\u2019ve achieved a level of structure while also allowing them to have personal autonomy. Not enough adults have this. \n\nPlus If you change it now to please your in laws, how do you think that will go over with your kids?", "NTA. Honestly, it sounds fine to me? You seem to be giving them just enough leeway that they don't abuse it and create a comfortable family environment.", "While I think it's of course good that you're not recreating the punitive, informant-and-enforcer situation you experienced, I also think that your current approach is going to be confusing for the kids. \n\nYou don't need to encourage them to tattle or punish them for not doing so. But what you've described is that it's openly known that the rules don't need to be followed. \n\nOutside of the dysfunctional situation your parents created, kids usually tattle because it feels *unfair* to them that they have done the right thing and followed the rule and someone else hasn't, and that's a totally valid feeling. \n\nWhen you effectively say 'you have to follow the rules but it's also fine if someone else doesn't', you're kinda killing the structure that kids need and often *want*. Are they rules or not? Do they have to follow them or not? If it doesn't matter either way, why should they do it? \n\nThere's natural consequences, sure, but then your rules are just 'advice' which kids can be terrible at taking, and the only real rule is 'reap whatever consequences happen to come your way, and assess those as you wish'.\n\nThe kids shouldn't be feeling that they have to be enforcers on each other, but it's understandable for them to say so if they feel they've done the right thing and someone else is doing the wrong thing. \n\nIt's ok to teach young adults to make good choices and own them, and at the eldest's age that is what she should be doing, but I do wonder if *you* \\- not the kids - need to enforcing structure a bit more than you are for the younger two.", "NTA It sounds like you have a good system that suits your family, and you show you trust your kids. That is huge. My parents didn't get us to snitch but never believed I'd make good choices and were very controlling. If I did anything wrong they made it a huge deal right into my early 20s. The result was that I left home as soon as I could and made bad choices because I didn't trust myself - still find it difficult now.  nor could I go to them for help because I knew they'd just over-react. \nWhat many so-called strict parents forget is the long game. \n1. Reasonable rules with good explanations will mostly be obeyed. When they aren't, consequences teach a lot.\n2. As children grow older, they learn responsibility when given the opportunity to practice it - like all skills, it doesn't automatically appear.\n3. Sibling relationships can be a support network all their lives. These relationships need nurturing from young. They'll need each other when you're old and have to make all the decisions.\n4. Building trust with them means they can come to you when the real s*t goes down, and it will.\n\nYou and your wife are doing great. You are raising good adults who have a growth mindset.", "NTA, so long as your kids wouldn't cover for something like sneaking off to meet someone you're all good.", "NTA\n\nTheir long term bond as siblings is more important than minor rule breaking. It seems you have taken to heart the outcome of your upbringing and are actively trying to avoid repeating history, good for you.", "NTA. Children need to be able to rebel/push boundaries  in someway, shape or form to feel like they are in control of themselves. And it feels like the bedtime is a great way for \u2018rebellion\u2019 when you\u2019re not home because like you said, there are natural consequences of it.\n\nAlso, if you trust your children, and you have an open communication with them, you would be amazed at what they tell you by just talking.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Unless implemented by a tyrant, rules aren't meant to be there for the sake of following them, they are to ensure safety.

I guess I got the impression that you're basically telling them *not* to tell on each other or say something to each other when someone isn't following the rules, which yeah is gonna offend their sense of fairness, even though we as adults find it petty and know it's adults' job to discipine etc. not the job of an annoyed sibling.\n\nAnd 'it's an open secret' that bedtime isn't followed makes it sound like there isn't consequences for breaking rules when you're not around.", "[deleted]", "Usual stuff for not doing chores, no TV for a day or two, not getting to hang out with friends for as long ect.", "NTA I had the same policy.

That built a camaraderie between us that tough teenage years couldn't break.", "But only as long as no one is getting hurt physically or emotionally, and doing drugs obviously is bad for ones health plus it could lead to problematic behavior if it results on an addiction hence, the rule on not telling on eachother is not valid as it would affect their wellbeing.\n\nPlus if they create a safe enough space for their kids (which looks like its whats happening), chances are that would never happen as they will feel enough trust on their parents to tell them stuff going on.\n\nLike my parents were the type to offer me try beer and wine when i was a teenager, even tried to buy my alcohol so i wouldnt drink on cheap stuff... They were super chill with me going with my friends out (who drank underage) as long as they knew all the info... And always encouraged me to call them if i felt bad or sick if i actually drank too much!!! (european alcohol culture is different) but the point is that i felt confident enough on telling them upfront, never sneaking and calling them if something was wrong, and as a result i only really got trashed once!"]}
