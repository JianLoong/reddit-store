That\u2019s weird if they wouldn\u2019t let you in.", "OP we need an update - did you leave?", "I can be at the bar like in the building but not sit at it. Kinda defeats the whole purpose of going since they sat at the bar and said they planned to before leaving. I\u2019d be eating at a table alone.", "I ended up going back to my house after talking to him. He apologized but I\u2019m taking some time to myself. Best believe he\u2019ll be driving to my house to see me in the future\u2026.. and I\u2019ll probably talk to him about it tomorrow better after a good nights sleep.", "That is so extremely mean of them. Like a grown up version of lunch table drama. I truly hope you are able to get yourself out of there and be back with people who want you around. Your boyfriend & his family are clearly showing their true colors. What a crappy situation to be stuck in.", "Please tell me there was something for you to eat in the house.", "If he really cared about you he would have sat with you on the Restuarant side.  Getting drunk means more to him than you.", "I think it depends on who told me this. My mom hated my boyfriend (he was emotionally abusive and isolated me from all of my friends), but she was an abusive narcissist so I absolutely didn't care about her opinion.", "Yeah! Good one! Or she's just gotten home from giving birth and he wants to invite his whole family to \"come and see the baby!\" (Seinfeld) Then he'll expect her to wait on HIS family and take care of the newborn and any other kids.", "Businesses that sell food allow 19 year old\u2019s into their premises.  She said elsewhere that she could have sat at table but the (trashy) family sat at the bar"]}
