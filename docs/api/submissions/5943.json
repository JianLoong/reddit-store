If you are in the US child support is calculated as a percentage of his income, if he recd a promotion and raise, his child support to you should take that into consideration and increase, if this is going thru court and not directly to you.   Depending upon your circumstances, if you were married he may also owe you alimony.

(He pd $200/mo for 3 kids, my rent was $900 a month). You take what you are awarded by the court. PEROID. If he wants it changed he can go to court to get it changed. End of story.", "Nta - the courts handle this accordingly to a formula based on income and percentage of time with child. He chose to not bag it up and has 2 kids now. Courts will factor that into account and he could file for a reduction in support but it won\u2019t go away entirely.", "That child support is for HIS CHILD. Not for him to go to Vegas with. I\u2019m sorry your kid has this sad excuse for a human as his father. \n\nNTA. \n\nHe could figure out how to impregnate another woman while schmoozing the current GF into living with him, he can figure out how to pay his child support bill.", "NTA. If he asks again, buy him a big box of condoms and call it a day.", "The kid's clothes are disappearing. Does the new GF have a kid or the new expectant mother have a kid the same age as OP's kid? Seems the disappearing clothes are going to another child.", "The money is for the child\u2019s care but it\u2019s owed to the custodial parent as they are doing the heavy lifting.", "He\u2019s a massive AH. That money is not going \u201cout the window,\u201d it\u2019s going to support his child!", "Wouldn't he still have to pay for childcare during that time? like a babysitter?", "Tell him that if he mentions it again you will be contacting a lawyer about child support fraud.", "A lot of people are emphasizing it because he's trying to take money away that is going to caring for his child! It's not just you being a big bad grinch who absorbs money. He's not ordered to give you money for no reason. If someone else had to deal with all the finances for your kid can you imagine? \n\nUhh yeah hey I know I gave you money for the kid to eat this week and so did op, but you should give my half back. He doesn't need to eat every day right?", "My ex owed me thousands and wanted to pay me but have me send it back to him. Excuse me what?! I told him he\u2019ll no. If he didn\u2019t pay he could just go to jail. I could care less cause I was still gonna do what I needed to as a mom.", "BTW: if you don't spend every single dime on your child right at this exact second, ummm... things get more expensive the older they get and then their's college and so many other expenses. Just because the money is not being used to buy Baby Nikes only means you are responsible with the money and saving for a rainy day!\n\nNTA he owes his child. Charge him for the soap and shampoo and laundry detergent you use while on his time.", "Buy him a box of condoms.", "nta not your problem", "Ha!\n\nThat\u2019s a big fat NO. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, if he didn't want a baby then use protection. There's no way a condom failed TWICE, he got two girls pregnant and now that's his problem. He should've wrapped better. Sounds like he thought the pull out method was a valid method", "NTA. In the US, his wages could be garnished for non-payment of child support. My cousin\u2019s mother got 17% of my uncle\u2019s pay check because he was a deadbeat like your ex. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re not American based on the way you wrote the times.  Is this an option where you are?", "Ah no, NTA. Your ex needs to step up and understand the consequences for having kids. He owes you and your child adequate support. All the other noise in the background around another child and apartments is irrelevant", "let the courts determine his payment, that;s what they're for.", "Have you also applied for child support?\n\nNTA\n\nETA: Make sure to document.", "Ol' Boy quite literally fucked around and found out.  It's his duty to support the children he creates.\n\nYou're NTA.  If you don't have court orders,  get them as soon as possible", "Nothing about what you\u2019ve said sounds petty. Plus he is not giving you $$ to go out with friends. He is giving money for his child to be supported. It is your child\u2019s right to have that $$. Take him to court, get it deducted from his pay and don\u2019t think twice about it. NTA", "NTA. If he didn\u2019t wanna pay child support for two kids, he shouldn\u2019t have had two kids.", "NTA Child support is normally ordered by the court so they clearly think it\u2019s fair for him to pay towards his children and he should just pay up and shut up", "NTA. Woman don't get pregnant alone... What an excuse of sperm donor!!!", "I think you should show your financial records to the court and let them decide. \n\nIn texas the non custodial parent pays 20% gross income for first child. It's supposed to be an equal amount paid by the mother. Yet most cases would be that the child would receive $2000 a month to live on. \n\nObviously that isn't happening, even with expenses itemized. \n\nMy husband went through this. Even paid more than he was ordered to by court. As it turns out the mother was using the money for her benefit, not the child. A court session later a d that was resolved.", "PREACH SIS!!!! You hold your foot down and collect that money that\u2019s for your KID! Your kid has every right to that child support. Fuck your baby daddy.", "Child support is for the parent to help them with the cost of raising the child like paying for shelter, food, clothes, necessities. It\u2019s not for the child. Why do people think it\u2019s for the child to have and decide how to use. I had a friend that believed what other people said that it was for the child and as soon as the child support was deposited in her account, the child would be asking for it so he could go out with his friends and spend it all while the mom worked and was still struggling paying the rent and bills. She had to turn off the heater in early spring even though it was still cold and even snow storms occur in our state because she couldn\u2019t pay the gas bill. The child support was meant to help her pay all those necessities needed to keep her child safe.", "Great advice re; text messaging, not answering calls, listening to the message and responding via text back.", "Yea. Do this.", "NTA", "NTA of course but if your financial situation (getting married) and his just changed he could probably go to court to get the child support payments reviewed. CS is to make sure the kid doesn\u2019t have a change in quality of life, so if your household earns more than his now he may not be responsible for as much. Of course if he really is having trouble making ends meet and wants to review this he should go through court", "Buy cheap stuff to go with him and keep the good clothes  home. There was a post where the ex was selling  the good clothes  and the mom bought cheap  clothes  the ex was angry  and made a stink but couldn't  do anything  about  it. Do the same.", "If you have 50/50 custody, he shouldn't be paying childsupport to you. He should be supporting the child 50 percent of the time. If you chose to act or spend during his time, then that is your issue. If his belongings disappear while hes at his dads, just send a set amount of belongings to stay at dads, and send him in the clothes he is wearing. (this is what I had to do)", "Also make a list of clothes  he needs to give your child whe he comes  over  to you. If something  is missing  buy them a couple  of times and send him the bill  to pay on top of child support.  He might give the clothes  to his other child which is why they dissappear. Nta"]}
