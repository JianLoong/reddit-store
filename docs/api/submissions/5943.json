It's money for your child's care, which he has a responsibility to pay.  Don't listen to him and don't let him make you feel bad.

So they are aware of your split and applied the amount. I would not change a thing. \n\nAlso, they take into account his child support for your child when factoring out her support, if she find out that he no longer pays you then she can go back to court and ask for an adjustment as his income/expenses has changed.

Get him set on child support paid through the court.

He's already taking advantage of you; he's just looking to see how big a pushover you are.", "Absolutely not. NTA.", "Info: is this not court ordered support?", "NTA.  He most likely will not be paying child support to his GF if they are living together because he is already supporting the child by providing a place for he and the mother of the child to live with him.  \n\nBut regardless of his baby w current gf, he is still obligated to pay support.  If you are in the US child support is calculated as a percentage of his income, if he recd a promotion and raise, his child support to you should take that into consideration and increase, if this is going thru court and not directly to you.   Depending upon your circumstances, if you were married he may also owe you alimony. Also there is wear and tear & gas/oil expense for picking your son up each day even when it is your son's week.\n\nBut you are correct, your child shouldn't suffer simply because he chose to impregnate someone else.\n\nIf your child support doesn't go thru court, i would strongly recommend you do so because given his track record, prob be a baby #3 &#4 not to long in the future, and it will be easier of you if the court takes the money directly out of his wages than you having to get the money from him each month.", "NTA, But I think that you know that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
