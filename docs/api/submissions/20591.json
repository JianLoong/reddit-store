(I teach) my parents have never asked me for money. Mom even hates it when I buy my own groceries.  I do help them with computer work and I cook.

What a joke. I would leave asap for the next all-inclusive trip and tell them to figure it out.", "NTA but what do you do? Asking for a friend...", "Hahaha I was like companionship is also included?! \n\nI think your experiences with your parents are in the transactional side - like oh I\u2019ll help physically but not financially or I\u2019ll help financially but not physically. All in all doesn\u2019t make you an asshole but it\u2019s interesting to view it that way.  I\u2019m thinking of it a bit personally like if my grandparents ( not close to my actual parents) asked for help I\u2019d do it both financially and physically, anything they need I\u2019d do it and I\u2019d try to coordinate with my siblings so I can vacation every so often. \nMy vote is NTA", "Exactly what I was thinking.", "This.  They are entitled to neither your help nor your money.  NTA.", "If I had an award I would give it to you.", "Nope.  I use my parents address for mail and such. I can usually find an all inclusive including flights for around $2000 or less. So my entire living expenses for the month are exactly that. My company pays for my flights to and from work. \n\nSo I stay in a nice hotel, somewhere with a beach, drink and eat for free, have maid service, and meet interesting people for a fraction of what my friends spend on rent and groceries.", "I'm a mechanic at a mine.", "I\u2019ll just imagine it. Oooooh pretty, thx. \ud83d\ude06", "No. I guess I could have been more clear.  When I stay at all inclusives I meet people and then we go back to the real world.", "i feel ya, i think the quotation marks made it feel more sketchy: also NTA, they asked you to help and now they want to charge you for it? who exactly is being mercenary here", "NTA - just go back to business as usual. It\u2019s been 4 months and they want money and chores? Nah. Live your life as you want, your efforts are obviously inappropriate \ud83d\ude1e", "Nta. They asked you to.stay and then asked for rent?", "NTA\n\nThe moment they called you a freeloader while you were performing farm related labour, to **help them no less,** was the moment family became a waste of time and money. You were more than charitable, but it's clear they don't appreciate you and think themselves entitled to both your money and your sweat.\n\nIt's frankly wise to know your boundaries and maintain them.", "The parents didn't ask for financial help tho, which would be understandable. They asked OP to pay for living in their home - where he lived only because they have asked him to help physically.\n\nSo in this case it's \"pay us for the benifit to be able to do heavy farm labor\", not \"I'll help either/or\". \n\nWorking in a mine is a very demanding job, it's not a walk in the park and these 2 weeks of rest are there for a very good reason. His time off is not a vacation, it's mandatory rest after heavy and stressful 2 week work shift. OP already sacrificed a lot to go help on the farm basically doing heavy work for 4 months non-stop. Making him pay for not being able to have any rest is an interesting approach to be sure."]}
