Recently we got a joined account for grocery shopping. The plan is that we both put in 210 dollars, so we have 420 for the entire month. This weekend we are having a movie marathon at my brother and SIL's and I baked a cake, some buns and bought some snacks. We were running low on some staple things such as eggs, milk and flour, so I bought this as well. I also bought some springrolls for an easy dinner, as well as a big bag of dates that will last forever and be used for lots of stuff. It all came to around 70 dollars.\n\nToday, while I was at my brothers and my boyfriend hadn't arrived yet, because he didn't feel like watching four movies in a row, my boyfriend wrote me a message with just my name. Nothing else. He normally never uses my real name, unless I've done something real bad. So my heart instantly started beating faster and I felt kind of sick. He then asked \"What have you spend 70 dollars on?\" And I explained that I had bought stuff for the weekend, as well as some staple stuff(My brother and SIL are providing food as well as snacks and soda) He was going on about it being a lot of money and that he didn't understand how I was even able to spend this much. I explained to him that the prices are crazy right now and that just the milk, eggs, flour and butter had been 14 dollars. He then wrote that he felt I was being rude/flippant(not sure how to explain it in English) but in it's essense a kind of rude word, that means that I'm not respecting him. Which I did not feel applied to my behaviour what so ever. I honestly felt like it was the complete opposite.\n\nI am now left with an awful feeling. My parents has always had a dynamic where my dad got mad at my mom, when she spend money. I don't want this dynamic in my relationship and now I'm kind of afraid that we will end up like that.\nI realise that 70 dollars is a lot of money, but that's honestly the times we are living in. At least where we live.\n\nAm I the asshole for spending the money?\n\nEDIT: I feel like I have to add that only about $30 was money spend on the weekend. The rest was for dinner and other necessities. It's a movie weekend that my boyfriend is also part of. I payed with our joint account as it was our \"share\" for the weekend.", "created_utc": 1668953307, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z050tk/aita_for_spending_70_dollars_from_our_joined/", "score": 164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you're going to be \"in trouble\" with him every time you buy food from the grocery store, then maybe this relationship needs some serious re-examining.", "You are NTA for spending the money. Your bf is being a terrible AH in the way he treats you.  Even if you had spent the money on items he doesn't approve of, he shouldn't treat you like a naughty child.  You are supposed to be partners.  If he is annoyed, he needs to talk to you like an adult.  He needs to respect you.", "NTA.

You put in my than you spent, you bought grocerles (what the account is for.

The time after that?

If they are intended to cover necessities, recommend disussion before using for discretionary spending, especially if funds are tight.\n\nHowever, what was especially concerning about your post was not just a simple discussion of helping a young couple figure out how to combine budgets.   \n\nI was much more concerned about you having this fear that you had done \"something bad\" and how it made you feel sick.  And that his response was rude/flippant.   This is not a very healthy way to work through financial issues together and implies a pattern of bullying / abusive behavior on his part that you are so afraid of him.  Is this the case?", "NTA. When someone shows you who they are, believe them. Your boyfriend is showing you some really troubling behaviour. I really hope you also have a bank account and credit cards of your own.

When is the last time he went shopping, himself?  Good for you for finding all that for only $14.  I wish I could do the same.\n\nTime for a frank talk with your boyfriend about a reality check about the price of what *he* and you eat--basic food costs.  If you are restricted to a budget, sounds like potatoes and lentils might become staples at your house, and he'd better not complain.  I'm sure you shop the sales, and you are aware that bulk purchases of shelf-stable items can represent a significant savings in the long term.\n\nDon't accept a relationship like your parents'.  If your boyfriend can't respect the reality of food prices once you've had your sit-down talk, maybe it's time for him to find out on his own, what the cost of feeding himself is.", "NTA\n\nWhy is your boyfriend treating you like a child?

Its totally one thing for him to ask you about the money and voice his concerns about the cost.  Entirely another thing to have made you feel like you did something wrong.  Unless you had that money earmarked specifically, this seems like a normal expense to have made. \n\nAnger is not a healthy way to discuss issues, especially new issues that haven't happened before.

It is not okay that you're scared of him.", "NTA at all. I\u2019d be wary doing joint accounts with someone you are not married to.

My mom had to do that to my dad after he complained she was spending more at the store. If he doesn\u2019t want to go, tell him to do the shopping next time.", "NTA though I would rethink this relationship. So many red flags. He is creating the dynamic you are trying to avoid. He shouldn't be using your given name like you are in trouble. That is just incredibly disrespectful. The fact that he is angry because you purchased food is not okay. It's not like you purchased a bunch of makeup or something. Food is essential.", "NTA that was A LOT of red flags. You being afraid. Him accusing first rather than not just having a conversation. Him thinking spending money from a joint account is some how disrespectful to him. You are the one in the relationship so you know if this is a pattern of abuse or just a one off situation. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, which I don\u2019t think he deserves, it might be helpful to sit down and figure out a budget and to discuss very clear boundaries on what the joint account can be used for. For example, let the other one know before making purchases over 50 dollars. But if you decide to make rules like that you both need to agree and it has to apply to both of you.", "No. She said the milk flour, eggs and butter were $14. Not all the other regular food. She used one example. She said she spent $30 on food for the weekend of which he is partaking. And the SIL & BIL spent money as well of which is is partaking. \n\nSo you have $14 for milk butt and eggs. $30 for the movie weekend. Which is $46. The remains $24 for was spent on other things they will eat during the week like dates and spring rolls. \n\nDo they need to have a comvo about what they consider necessities? Probably. But your reaction is way over the top and makes me think you are the BF and are annoyed this is not going your way.

He is verbally abusive. Your partner should never cause that kind of reaction, especially over something like groceries.", "NTA. Once of the things that really bothers me about this is that he was accusatory right from the start, before he knew what you had spent the money on. That's not healthy communication, regardless of whether you should have spent the money. It's like he was watching for you to \"misstep\" on something so he could attack you. Also, once he knew what you had spent it on, he continued to escalate. He could have suggested that the two of you sit down and hash out what exactly that shared money is for. Instead, he reacted in a way that was bullying and scary. That's not good and I think you should reevaluate whether this is a relationship you should be in. It's not unreasonable for you to think that what you purchased should have come from that fund. He may disagree that it wasn't appropriate. Couples disagree about all sorts of things. But his reaction is worrisome.", "A joint account for $420 a month, is it really for groceries?", "NTA - it\u2019s not like you spent the money on just yourself. You bought necessities. Tell him to do the groceries next time so he sees how expensive everything has gotten. I went to Walmart and bought stuff that would have cost be no more that $30-40 a few years ago and now it\u2019s costs $80. It\u2019s crazy.", "NTA but I\u2019d withdraw my money from the joint account asap. He\u2019s giving controlling vibes.", "NTA - he's coming across very controlling.  And I'm afraid you're heading in the same direction as your parents.  When you get home from grocery shopping, just leave the receipt on the counter so Mr. Bossy can see what you bought.  Otherwise, he can keep his opinions to himself.  Does he do any of the shopping?  Food prices have rocketed!\n\nYou shouldn't have to justify anything from the grocery money.", "NTA. You help put money in, you can help spend it. He sounds like the start of a financially abusive jerk. Keep your money in your own account.

Somewhere along the line in their relationship, it became established between the two of them that when her boyfriend uses her real name, it means that OP is \"in trouble\" with him and it automatically triggers a fear response in her:\n\n> *\"So my heart instantly started beating faster and I felt kind of sick.\"*\n\nHe clearly knows that using her name elicits this response in her, which is why he opened their whole conversation by sending a message to her that contained her name and ***only*** her name. He knows what he's doing and he knows that it will trigger her and scare her, because he has already established this in their relationship. Do you not see how concerning that is? Most everyone else here does. Our partners are our *partners,* they are not our parents or authority figures.\n\nBeyond that, this sets a terrible precedent for the future: that being that the boyfriend sees the money in their *joint* account as belonging *only to him* (you seem to see it that way too, interestingly enough) and putting OP in a position where she will have to justify herself every time she has to use it.
