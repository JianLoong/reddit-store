She grew up upper middle class and always got everything she wanted. Even though she is an adult, she is still acting like that and my best buddy, Anthony, is allowing it. Just during last year, she got a condo, a tons of decorations and useless stuff, a new iPhone, Apple watch, an expensive bicycle, a purse, like 4 vacations and I don't even know what not. Anthony literally doesn't say no to anything she wants.\n\nThe problem is that Camilla is constantly whispering into my wife's ear to get her to follow her path. She is always showing off her new stuff and her pictures of their vacations. Then my wife is coming to me whining as to why we can't go on vacations like that when we make over 1.5x as much as them.\n\nOf course, Camilla is now planning a skiing holiday and another spring vacation. So I thought it was time to sit down with Anthony and talk. I told him he needs to stop spoiling his wife and teach her some self constraint. He said there is nothing wrong with his wife and Camilla deserves to get everything she wishes. She makes much more than him anyway and he is not a controlling asshole. \n\nYeah, so he basically called me a controlling asshole and I started to get angry at that point. I said I'm just looking out for our future with my wife and he should do so too with his. They are too old to just blow through money like that and I'm concerned about him.\n\nHe said I don't need to be worried, Camilla is actually really good with money and even though they bought their condo just a year ago, they could already pay off their mortgage in total if they wanted to.\n\nI'm not sure I believe him on that one, I know exactly how much money they are making and that's just impossible, it's definitely a lie. But the point is that Antony is now angry at me for talking down on his wife and is demanding an apology. \n\nShould I apologise for looking out for my friend? Shouldn't he apologise for calling me a controlling asshole?

Anthony literally doesn't say no to anything she wants.\n\nThe problem is that Camilla is constantly whispering into my wife's ear to get her to follow her path. She is always showing off her new stuff and her pictures of their vacations. Then my wife is coming to me whining as to why we can't go on vacations like that when we make over 1.5x as much as them.\n\nOf course, Camilla is now planning a skiing holiday and another spring vacation. So I thought it was time to sit down with Anthony and talk. I told him he needs to stop spoiling his wife and teach her some self constraint. He said there is nothing wrong with his wife and Camilla deserves to get everything she wishes. She makes much more than him anyway and he is not a controlling asshole. \n\nYeah, so he basically called me a controlling asshole and I started to get angry at that point. I said I'm just looking out for our future with my wife and he should do so too with his. They are too old to just blow through money like that and I'm concerned about him.\n\nHe said I don't need to be worried, Camilla is actually really good with money and even though they bought their condo just a year ago, they could already pay off their mortgage in total if they wanted to.\n\nI'm not sure I believe him on that one, I know exactly how much money they are making and that's just impossible, it's definitely a lie. But the point is that Antony is now angry at me for talking down on his wife and is demanding an apology. \n\nShould I apologise for looking out for my friend? Shouldn't he apologise for calling me a controlling asshole? AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
