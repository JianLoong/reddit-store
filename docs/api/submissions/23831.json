It\u2019s not super fair.\n\nHowever, if you have a problem with what someone is doing in the workplace, report to HR. Do not stoop down to their level and engage in the joking. When you do you give people the chance to say that it\u2019s mutual or worse build a worse case against you because the \u201cboy\u201d comment could be perceived as racist.\n\nIf you and your supervisor can\u2019t take jokes then you both should just stop joking because you both sound like hypocrites.", "ESH\n\nI cannot think of **any** circumstance under which it is appropriate to call someone \"boy.\"", "ESH, slightly.

That your superior that you are supposed to respect and follow the instructions of is in fact a little child that you can order around?\n\nThere are many things that people can joke about, but managers or supervisors cannot let that go as far as destroying their ability to do their job.  I doubt you'd appreciate him joking about things that could cost you your job.\n\n> I let it be known that I'm not okay with it\n\nWell that's an important point too, if there are sexual jokes that you aren't OK with regularly taking place then you have every right to put an end to that.  A simple and calm, \"I've told you I'm not OK with these kinds of jokes and if they still continue I'm going to have to put in a complaint\"  --> haha we were just joking around blah blah  --> \"I'm not joking here, please take the hint here as I'd rather not go down the formal route\".", "YTA for not turning in the manager for sexual harassment.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
