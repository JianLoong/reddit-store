We had our son not too long ago in 2021 and have started a nice little family together. Lately, my husband had been working on a new business venture at has completely taken up his time. As such, I have been the breadwinner for all shared expenses, the primary caregiver to our son, and caretaker of our home. He always seems stressed and tired. \n\nHe recently started to complain that we don\u2019t go out enough. I tried to explain with me being the one with a steady income that I don\u2019t have the luxury to spend extra cash on big plans, but we can do little things. So I started to plan little outings, friend and family get togethers etc. Though he appreciated it, 80% of the time he would make me reschedule because he \u201cjust\u201d received an important message that requires him to go to meetings or whatever it is he needs to do for the business, even on weekends. \n\nI understood that it\u2019s important what he was doing, but felt like the additional effort I was making for his benefit was constantly being looked over. It sucks having to constantly call up friends last minutes and say things have been canceled. To the point where a few friends rarely respond anymore. \n\nAround October of last year I had enough. I told him I was planning a week long vacation to TN for March of this year. I kept updating him of our plans, reminding him twice a week, taking time off from my work, letting my son\u2019s daycare know, booking hotels and events, and paying for all of it out of my pocket. I knew he was stressed and wanted to help alleviate some of the pressure off of him.\n\nAnd then today happened. So our flight is scheduled for Monday morning and we won\u2019t get back to the following Monday. All of a sudden, he gets a call that some important people that could help his business are getting into town this weekend and staying for the month. Told he he needs us to reschedule the trip. I was furious. All the effort I put into it. All of the time I put into looking at locations, attractions, things to do as a family, etc wasted. He told me the people are important for his business and I could easily reschedule and change our flights and hotel dates. I told him if it\u2019s so easy, why can\u2019t he rescdule. I was told because he don\u2019t know when else they would be available. \n\nSo, I called my mom and asked if she would like to do a girls trip with me and my son to TN. She said yes and I changed the airline tickets to her. When my husband found out what I did, he was frustrated with me and and told me I was acting like a brat.\n\nSince this afternoon, I\u2019ve had phone calls with all the in laws and a mutual friend saying I\u2019m overreacting and just try to accommodate him so that we can have a nice family trip. I really don\u2019t want to change anything and some of the comments made by the in laws do make sense.\n\n(This was all written on my phone so sorry for any spelling or grammar issues)", "created_utc": 1677902584, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11howlo/aita_for_not_taking_husband_on_planned_family/", "score": 622, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
