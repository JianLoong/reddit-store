We had our son not too long ago in 2021 and have started a nice little family together. Lately, my husband had been working on a new business venture at has completely taken up his time. As such, I have been the breadwinner for all shared expenses, the primary caregiver to our son, and caretaker of our home. He always seems stressed and tired. \n\nHe recently started to complain that we don\u2019t go out enough. I tried to explain with me being the one with a steady income that I don\u2019t have the luxury to spend extra cash on big plans, but we can do little things. So I started to plan little outings, friend and family get togethers etc. Though he appreciated it, 80% of the time he would make me reschedule because he \u201cjust\u201d received an important message that requires him to go to meetings or whatever it is he needs to do for the business, even on weekends. \n\nI understood that it\u2019s important what he was doing, but felt like the additional effort I was making for his benefit was constantly being looked over. It sucks having to constantly call up friends last minutes and say things have been canceled. To the point where a few friends rarely respond anymore. \n\nAround October of last year I had enough. I told him I was planning a week long vacation to TN for March of this year. I kept updating him of our plans, reminding him twice a week, taking time off from my work, letting my son\u2019s daycare know, booking hotels and events, and paying for all of it out of my pocket. I knew he was stressed and wanted to help alleviate some of the pressure off of him.\n\nAnd then today happened. So our flight is scheduled for Monday morning and we won\u2019t get back to the following Monday. All of a sudden, he gets a call that some important people that could help his business are getting into town this weekend and staying for the month. Told he he needs us to reschedule the trip. I was furious. All the effort I put into it. All of the time I put into looking at locations, attractions, things to do as a family, etc wasted. He told me the people are important for his business and I could easily reschedule and change our flights and hotel dates. I told him if it\u2019s so easy, why can\u2019t he rescdule. I was told because he don\u2019t know when else they would be available. \n\nSo, I called my mom and asked if she would like to do a girls trip with me and my son to TN. She said yes and I changed the airline tickets to her. When my husband found out what I did, he was frustrated with me and and told me I was acting like a brat.\n\nSince this afternoon, I\u2019ve had phone calls with all the in laws and a mutual friend saying I\u2019m overreacting and just try to accommodate him so that we can have a nice family trip. I really don\u2019t want to change anything and some of the comments made by the in laws do make sense.\n\n(This was all written on my phone so sorry for any spelling or grammar issues)", "created_utc": 1677902584, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11howlo/aita_for_not_taking_husband_on_planned_family/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And you need to put a clear time limit on how long he can allow this \u2018business venture\u2019 to prevent him from contributing literally anything to your family life. E.g. if he\u2019s not able to contribute financially and as a parent within a year, he needs to go back to a regular old job so he can be a half decent partner to you. And in the meantime, you can go on your trip and stop trying to plan things for him to flake on. Live your life and see if he wants to check back into this marriage or not.", "NTA. These \u201cimportant to his business\u201d people are going to be in town for a month, the trip you planned is only a week long. There\u2019s no reason he would be expected to drop everything and be immediately available to them. He could have simply told them, \u201cI don\u2019t have any availability over the next week, let\u2019s schedule a meeting for week after next, I have openings then.\u201d Anyone who is a serious potential business partner or investor would not have a problem with that. \n\nNot sure what kind of game your husband is playing, but it seems like he\u2019s trying to sabotage your plans in a way where he can make you the bad guy. Tell him he screwed up, you\u2019re taking the trip you planned and paid for because *you* need the break after so many months of doing literally everything for your household, and if he doesn\u2019t like it, tough. When the in-laws call, tell them to keep their noses out of *your* marriage, it\u2019s none of their business, and your husband is childish for trying to drag them into it.", "Hon, this isn't the way healthy marriages operate. You're breadwinner, single parent, cleaner and the only one performing emotional labor? This is an entirely broken system where you have been enslaved by this guy. It's time to wake up and realize that this vacation thing is just a drop in the bucket when it comes to how fundamentally unbalanced your relationship is.\n\nNTA", "Nta. What kind of game is he playing?", "NTA.   Habitual plan-changing is a form of crazy-making.  It denies people the ability to plan and structure their own lives and makes everyone dependent on you.\n\nYou drew the line and said \u201cNo more,\u201d and that\u2019s appropriate.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is being selfish and, frankly, stupid. Whatever he's doing isn't panning out if you're the one paying the bills. His shitty little \"business venture\" is going to be the ruin of your family if he lets it. If it's not paying the bills, it's not important.", "NTA. Work is important but there needs to be compromise on both ends of the relationship. You should not always be the one accomodating him, you gave plenty of time in advance and did all the planning yourself. He needs to learn to prioritize and make time for his family.", "NTA\n\nHe's been screwing up your plans for a long time and there are no guarantees he won't bail again if you reschedule. Clearly his business is more important to him than you or his son. Go without him, have a great time and leave him with his precious business.", "NTA. You\u2019ve been far too easy on him if you\u2019re losing friends for cancelling all the time. Stop cancelling.

It sounds like you have been supportive of your husbands career changes and you have put your plans on hold again and again and again. He says to reschedule it all, but can he guarantee you that when the trip comes up again that there won\u2019t be \u201cimportant people that need him\u201d.? Ask him THAT. Work is important and sometimes things happen, but family is more important and it sounds like he consistently chooses it over you and your family over and over again. Also: If they are staying for the month, why can\u2019t he meet with them when you get back?? He needs to decide what is really important to him. Go on your trip and don\u2019t let him make you feel like crap. Tennessee is a beautiful state, if you go to the Smokey mountains, hike up to clingmans dome and take in the view.", "NTA\n\nSo your husband's business venture was so important that he can't spend time with the family?\n\nIt sounds like you did all the planning and work into this vacation. It's good that you updated him on everything, but it's silly that he didn't help you out at all.", "NTA He\u2019s not being fair to you with all the plan changing. You\u2019re the one doing absolutely everything for your family right now. I know starting a business is hard, but he needs to reexamine his priorities. The business building can\u2019t be at the expense of everything and everyone else. I hope you guys have a wonderful time in TN!", "NTA.  It seems like you need the vacation just as much as you thought he did.  You don't have the flexibility as he does to change things at the last minute.  Tell him you are going on this vacation, he can plan the next one.", "NTA. You are away for 8 days and the people are in town for a month, that is 28 days. So he could\u2019ve seen them after your family vacation. Go and enjoy your vacation without his inconsiderate AH self.", "NTA. Business owners don't have free time. Not new business owners.", "NTA.\n\nAre you sure he is not having an affair? What details do you have on the \u201cbusiness\u201d", "NTA- these people are going to be in town for a month, why can\u2019t he wait a week to see them?", "NTA.... You have been doing the heavy lifting for your family. He hasnt learned how to prioritize, this is dangerous.  \nBut there is nothing wrong with going on vacation with mom. Enjoy", "NTA, your husband is being selfish. It certainly doesn't sound like his business venture is panning out. If these important people are really interested in your husband's business then they will wait and be available when you all get back from vacation. The fact that he won't even attempt to reschedule these people means he's either spineless and a door mat, or maybe he's desperate as he knows his business is tanking. Be very careful with your finances.", "NTA, but if I were you I\u2019d be skeptical as hell about all this \u2018business\u2019 stuff that \u2018just happens\u2019 to crop up _every single time you make plans_. And with aaaallll this work he doesn\u2019t seem to be bringing any money.", "NTA. Hubby needs to learn how to arrange his priorities.", "NTA \nEnjoy your trip", "INFO:  Would he do this for you?  Would he earn all the money, take care of your child alone, and do all the physical and emotional labor for your household?", "NTA. They're going to be here for a MONTH. that gives him three damn weeks to meet with them and suck up to them and get their business.\n\nGo have fun with your mum and your kiddo, and he can stew in his own frustration. Next time maybe he'll think twice about taking you for granted.\n\nAnd if he doesn't, you'll know his priorities and to act accordingly.", "You don't have to listen to me, but it may be time to really consider if this relationship is worth keeping. NTA.", "NTA.  Perhaps your mutual friend and in laws could help cover your expenses and help around the house since they\u2019re so comfortable having opinions on what you do.  Your husbands lack of being a contributing member of your household is really not fair.  You deserve that much needed vacation.", "ESH.
