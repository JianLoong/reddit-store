We had our son not too long ago in 2021 and have started a nice little family together. Lately, my husband had been working on a new business venture at has completely taken up his time. As such, I have been the breadwinner for all shared expenses, the primary caregiver to our son, and caretaker of our home. He always seems stressed and tired. \n\nHe recently started to complain that we don\u2019t go out enough. I tried to explain with me being the one with a steady income that I don\u2019t have the luxury to spend extra cash on big plans, but we can do little things. So I started to plan little outings, friend and family get togethers etc. Though he appreciated it, 80% of the time he would make me reschedule because he \u201cjust\u201d received an important message that requires him to go to meetings or whatever it is he needs to do for the business, even on weekends. \n\nI understood that it\u2019s important what he was doing, but felt like the additional effort I was making for his benefit was constantly being looked over. It sucks having to constantly call up friends last minutes and say things have been canceled. To the point where a few friends rarely respond anymore. \n\nAround October of last year I had enough. I told him I was planning a week long vacation to TN for March of this year. I kept updating him of our plans, reminding him twice a week, taking time off from my work, letting my son\u2019s daycare know, booking hotels and events, and paying for all of it out of my pocket. I knew he was stressed and wanted to help alleviate some of the pressure off of him.\n\nAnd then today happened. So our flight is scheduled for Monday morning and we won\u2019t get back to the following Monday. All of a sudden, he gets a call that some important people that could help his business are getting into town this weekend and staying for the month. Told he he needs us to reschedule the trip. I was furious. All the effort I put into it. All of the time I put into looking at locations, attractions, things to do as a family, etc wasted. He told me the people are important for his business and I could easily reschedule and change our flights and hotel dates. I told him if it\u2019s so easy, why can\u2019t he rescdule. I was told because he don\u2019t know when else they would be available. \n\nSo, I called my mom and asked if she would like to do a girls trip with me and my son to TN. She said yes and I changed the airline tickets to her. When my husband found out what I did, he was frustrated with me and and told me I was acting like a brat.\n\nSince this afternoon, I\u2019ve had phone calls with all the in laws and a mutual friend saying I\u2019m overreacting and just try to accommodate him so that we can have a nice family trip.

Find out why.", "What has he done for you lately? Nothing, it sounds like. You do all the housework. You do all the childcare. You pay all the bills. You sound like a single parent. You've lost friends because of him. Your husband is selfish and inconsiderate. I bet things won't get better even after his business finally starts making money. He'll still expect you to do everything. After everything he has put you through, you deserve a vacation. So go and don't let him ruin it. NTA", "So he has no time to dedicate to the vacation planning, but he has time to complain about his feelings to uninvested friends and family? \n\nNTA", "Just the fact that he is tattling to his family and friends makes him TA.\n\nNTA.", "So you're the breadwinner and you do all the housework and childcare. And all he contributes is blame and frustration. Please think about how your life might be better if you weren't twisting yourself to please someone who will never be happy\n\nEnjoy your trip! NTA", "Bon voyage!! \u2708\ufe0f", "I get being busy but OP\u2019s husband has made it extremely clear that his venture will ALWAYS take priority over his family. To the point where he\u2019s clearly communicating to them that they\u2019re not important to him in the least.\n\nHe needs to snap out of it and be there for OP and their kids. Even if they stay married he\u2019s going to lose his relationship with them.", "He is screwing someone\u2026 I am just not sure it is her.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s another woman, bc then wouldn\u2019t be jump at the chance to have her and their son out of town for a whole week?", "OP judgement ::  NTA  \n\n\n>He recently started to complain that we don\u2019t go out enough\n\nBut he doesn't do anything to help with the bill, child care or stuff around the house.   \n\n\n>I have been the breadwinner for all shared expenses, the primary caregiver to our son, and caretaker of our home  \n>  \n>80% of the time he would make me reschedule \n\n  your trip is for a week.. and these people, while yes they come in this weekend, will be here for a month?  so why does he have to see them THIS weekend?  \n\n\nop you need a break and since your hubby can't see that you did what you needed to do to take that break.  \n\n\n and him  bitching out to his family is a \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 to me.    the inlaws need to butt out of your marriage.", "Your husband is minimizing and dismissing all the labor you do. You work, pay the bills, take care of your child and home, and make all the arrangements for outings and trips that he wants but can\u2019t be bothered to actually show up for. And then he whines to his in-laws when you have a disagreement. I hope that he makes some positive contribution to your lives. Because from this post, it doesn\u2019t appear so. \n\nYou\u2019re absolutely right to go without him. In fact, this should be your standing policy going forward (and if I\u2019m honest, should have been your policy from the beginning). This is the plan, these are the dates and times, and we are going with or without you. NTA", "Nta- I'd have done the same", "People will be in town for one month.\nPeople should scheduled upon return of family vacation.\nAnyone with a serious interest of investing in his business, should not expect him to drop everything at a whim. That is very telling, seems desperate.", "NTA. And STOP RESCHEDULING YOUR PLANS FOR HIM.", "NTA - have fun and stop canceling on your friends & family. His loss.", "NTA and DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING. People kill me, and a relationship is a job. You don't place all the responsibilities on one partner, that is an AH move. To make either a success requires putting in the time and making sacrifices, which your husband didn't get the message.", "You changed the airline tickets to your mom? How is that possible?", "NTA", "NTA. You are doing way too much. There is no partnership happening. If your husband thinks that, between his business venture and you being the sole breadwinner and sole caretaker of your child, you aren\u2019t going out enough, it\u2019s on him to take care of that. He can plan it, and when he suddenly gets a call, he can be the one taking care of the rescheduling.", "I agree but what makes it worse is that the people hes meeting will be there for a month so he could have met them after the trip.", "He's probably insecure af because his partner is holding EVERYTHING down while he is....I really don't know what he is. So he goes and sabotages her left and right, making her feel badly because it makes HIM feel better. \n\nI hope she enjoys her trip.

You paid for your trip. You deserve your trip. Enjoy it.", "He also could have flown in 1-3 days later instead and just missed a few days of the trip. It\u2019s so selfish to disrupt the entire trip and demand that it be rescheduled for him.", "Right? I don't know if it's a cultural difference, but I can't imagine having an argument with my partner and \n\nA. For him to run to his parents/sibling/friends just to rant about me INSTEAD OF trying to resolve it with me\n\nB. Let's say it's a bad fight and he needed to vent to someone.

Like wtf?", "Yeah, even if her husbands business works out and makes money, is it even worth it if he\u2019s just gonna be like this all the time?

The only thing the husband has done is complain and cancel plans. She does all the heavy lifting she's the breadwinner, does all the work around the house, and is responsible for child care. Husband complains about not going out more but then when she plans something she has to cancel. She has had to cancel plans so many times that friends have started to not respond to her. How many times is she going to have to cancel for him? He literally has to do nothing but show up and he cant even do that ffs. She's NTA and she's even more NTA for inviting her mom.", "Yeah, I didn't get the affair vibe, I think he's doing some Amway shit and his uplines are bullying him into all this."]}
