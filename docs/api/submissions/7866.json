I don't necessarily bring this up with people, I really don't care what other people eat (my bf is not vegan or vegetarian, and we have no conflicts over this if I can offer that up as proof I'm not pushing my beliefs onto other people). Jordan used to be just an average omnivore, but he's gotten increasingly anti-veganism as a concept and has started to talk about how awful it is and vegans are more and more.\n\nRecently we were all together, and Jordan started talking about how disgusting vegan food is and how its all processed and fake and he would never eat something like that. I said \"Well that's not true, all the food at my party last month was vegan, and you liked all of that\". He got really upset, telling me I was a monster, I was forcing my beliefs on him, that he never would have eaten the food had he known it was vegan, that I tricked him and that was a really fucked up thing to do.\n\nGuys, the food I had at my party was: chips, salsa, guac. spring rolls. olives, hummus, baba ganoush, falafel, tahini sauce. veggies & red pesto dip (labelled as having nuts in it). mini samosas with chutney.\n\nNone of it was \"fake\" anything, none of it was anything you would typically expect to have animal products in it (maaaybe the samosa you could make a case for expecting chicken in, I guess). I didn't hide anything. Those foods just \\*are\\* vegan, I really don't think I ought to have warned Jordan about that. I also feel like if he was that worried about it he could have asked me about the food, which is what I do for my diet (a thing he makes fun of me for, btw). It was a board game party with wine + appetizers, and I just put out the snacks I like I really wasn't trying to be political. \n\nBut he was truly upset, so maybe I should have done something different? Logically I feel like he's being a baby, but emotionally I feel like maybe I crossed a line.

He was upset because he got **owned**. You were entirely right. Omnivores eat vegan meals and snacks regularly without even thinking of it.

Tricking a Jew who keeps kosher into eating non-kosher food is asshole behavior. The opposite is not true. Non-vegans eat non-vegan food all the time. Guac is vegan. Most chips are vegan.

It's all side dishes and snack food. Jordan is a major ah for thinking that you tricked him.

I wouldn't think that's cool because some people are very sensitive about this and can very well take it personal, not normal if you ask me and not saying the guy is right to be this upset, but it happens, he seems to have deeper issues.\n\nNow you know how sensitive he is about all this, make sure you don't get caught up in it, let him be his negative self if that is what he wants.\n\nAnd it's always great to let people know what food you present, the same way you check about allergies, shows you are aware and care.\n\nIf you didn't trick him NTA.", "NTA but mainly only because the things you put out are like u say just within themselvs vegan or juss reg veggies,why I write it like this thogh is because recently I think there was a post about how a host switched their friends food to some spcialy made vegan dish without saying anything and the person was allergic to somthing in it and almost died.", "NTA, this all sounds delish.

But if it's shredded, it may have some risk of gluten contamination because they sometimes lube the shredding machines with flour to keep the cheese from sticking. So the packet of shredded cheese may contain gluten because of the machinery involved.", "they've been best friends since childhood, I'm really hesitant to weigh in on it to much but yeah, I kinda hate having jordan in my life\n\nto be fair he's not very worldly, I guess he doesn't know whats in baba ganoush or samosas so maybe I should've realized that", "He's been getting into the carnivore diet recently so...I guess not lol", "lmao that's funny, maybe I should\n\nmostly he eats like chicken tenders, which is funny because they're breaded so therefore have plant ingredients and I'm tempted to tease him about that but I really do not want to hear about the benefits of eating only meat again so I keep my mouth shut lol", "Right?

Jordan was criticizing vegan substitutes that try imitate meat with varying degrees of success/failure, that are invariably inferior to their vegetarian counterparts that don't try to imitate anything, and you went, \"Nuh-uh, you had chips therefore you ate vegan!\" Firstly, no, they're just vegan-compatible, veganism is according to you a lifestyle, remember? You're just going for a cheap gotcha which always gets you asshole points. Secondly, your description of Jordan's reaction makes me doubt your whole story. How does enjoying chips and veggies defend vegan substitutes in the slightest? It doesn't. And if Jordan was a real person he'd come up with a similar response, the fact you have him logically shut down and attack the food he liked instead makes me question his existence or at least you have to be leaving major parts of the story out (if he has a mental issue you'd be twice the asshole). Saying you tricked him into eating chips because chips are...pfftt!, vegan? It didn't go down that way, did it, OP?\n\nVegetarianism is a well-balanced diet, don't think it's as good as Mediterranean, but still very good. Jordan however is right about veganism requiring supplements for at least B12 and often Iron as well since the HEMA Iron found in meat is more easily digestible than the Iron in plant foods and many people have issues absorbing the latter. Zinc, Calcium, and a couple other B Vitamins are additional points of concern. Jordan is wrong about the rich part though assuming he said it.
