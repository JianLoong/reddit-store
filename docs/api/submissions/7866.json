Jordan used to be just an average omnivore, but he's gotten increasingly anti-veganism as a concept and has started to talk about how awful it is and vegans are more and more.\n\nRecently we were all together, and Jordan started talking about how disgusting vegan food is and how its all processed and fake and he would never eat something like that. I said \"Well that's not true, all the food at my party last month was vegan, and you liked all of that\". He got really upset, telling me I was a monster, I was forcing my beliefs on him, that he never would have eaten the food had he known it was vegan, that I tricked him and that was a really fucked up thing to do.\n\nGuys, the food I had at my party was: chips, salsa, guac. spring rolls. olives, hummus, baba ganoush, falafel, tahini sauce. veggies & red pesto dip (labelled as having nuts in it). mini samosas with chutney.\n\nNone of it was \"fake\" anything, none of it was anything you would typically expect to have animal products in it (maaaybe the samosa you could make a case for expecting chicken in, I guess). I didn't hide anything. Those foods just \\*are\\* vegan, I really don't think I ought to have warned Jordan about that. I also feel like if he was that worried about it he could have asked me about the food, which is what I do for my diet (a thing he makes fun of me for, btw). It was a board game party with wine + appetizers, and I just put out the snacks I like I really wasn't trying to be political. \n\nBut he was truly upset, so maybe I should have done something different?

He was upset because he got **owned**. You were entirely right. Omnivores eat vegan meals and snacks regularly without even thinking of it.

Tricking a Jew who keeps kosher into eating non-kosher food is asshole behavior. The opposite is not true. Non-vegans eat non-vegan food all the time. Guac is vegan. Most chips are vegan.

It's all side dishes and snack food. Jordan is a major ah for thinking that you tricked him.

I wouldn't think that's cool because some people are very sensitive about this and can very well take it personal, not normal if you ask me and not saying the guy is right to be this upset, but it happens, he seems to have deeper issues.\n\nNow you know how sensitive he is about all this, make sure you don't get caught up in it, let him be his negative self if that is what he wants.\n\nAnd it's always great to let people know what food you present, the same way you check about allergies, shows you are aware and care.\n\nIf you didn't trick him NTA.", "NTA but mainly only because the things you put out are like u say just within themselvs vegan or juss reg veggies,why I write it like this thogh is because recently I think there was a post about how a host switched their friends food to some spcialy made vegan dish without saying anything and the person was allergic to somthing in it and almost died.", "NTA, this all sounds delish.

But if it's shredded, it may have some risk of gluten contamination because they sometimes lube the shredding machines with flour to keep the cheese from sticking. So the packet of shredded cheese may contain gluten because of the machinery involved.", "they've been best friends since childhood, I'm really hesitant to weigh in on it to much but yeah, I kinda hate having jordan in my life\n\nto be fair he's not very worldly, I guess he doesn't know whats in baba ganoush or samosas so maybe I should've realized that", "He's been getting into the carnivore diet recently so...I guess not lol", "lmao that's funny, maybe I should\n\nmostly he eats like chicken tenders, which is funny because they're breaded so therefore have plant ingredients and I'm tempted to tease him about that but I really do not want to hear about the benefits of eating only meat again so I keep my mouth shut lol", "Right?

You didn\u2019t substitute anything with a mock product here, so you didn\u2019t trick anyone.", "NTA\n\nHe is being a baby. I would eat everything you listed except  the guac and olives, and that is because I do not like guac or olives.", "No offense, but why are you even asking if you\u2019re TA? He\u2019s obviously a clown considering he willfully ate the food you made and you didn\u2019t lie to him about what food you made. \n\nNTA. Your boyfriends friend is stupid.", "NTA.  As long as you are not trying to pass off food as something it isn't there is no tricking people into eating food unless you hide an ingredient. \nAlso, diets for the most part are a personal choice that needs to be researched before starting. For example, a common issue with keto is that people are so strict with it that they don't eat enough produce and fiber.", "Your brain needs carbs to function. He\u2019s clearly not getting any. NTA", "NTA. Jordan is just a dick to be one. I have some ethical issues with vegans, but A LOT of foods are naturally vegan and some AH take more issue with the term itself than understanding that food is still good at the end of the day", "Wait, you didn't put meat in the guac and salsa? You monster! NTA.", "Yes, you can. Mock meat and mock dairy are heavily processed products that I don\u2019t eat for a couple reasons, one of which is the evacuating death of my gut for a day, and I\u2019d be pissed if someone tried to \u201cgotcha\u201d me with them.", "It does! If I was complaining about vegan substitutes and a vegan went, \"Ah-ha! You ate chips though! And veggies! You like vegan food!,\" I'd just look at them like they were nuts, tell them veggies, chips, and stuff are universal foods that vegans don't own, and that their attempted gotcha doesn't save Beyond Meat burgers from criticism. OP would have us believe that Jordan just self-destructed in the face of his superior logic...and of course pro-vegan reddit is eating this up and downvoting any of us that profess skepticism.", "Dude, face it, you were playing semantics. Jordan was criticizing vegan substitutes that try imitate meat with varying degrees of success/failure, that are invariably inferior to their vegetarian counterparts that don't try to imitate anything, and you went, \"Nuh-uh, you had chips therefore you ate vegan!\" Firstly, no, they're just vegan-compatible, veganism is according to you a lifestyle, remember? You're just going for a cheap gotcha which always gets you asshole points. Secondly, your description of Jordan's reaction makes me doubt your whole story. How does enjoying chips and veggies defend vegan substitutes in the slightest? It doesn't. And if Jordan was a real person he'd come up with a similar response, the fact you have him logically shut down and attack the food he liked instead makes me question his existence or at least you have to be leaving major parts of the story out (if he has a mental issue you'd be twice the asshole). Saying you tricked him into eating chips because chips are...pfftt!, vegan? It didn't go down that way, did it, OP?\n\nVegetarianism is a well-balanced diet, don't think it's as good as Mediterranean, but still very good. Jordan however is right about veganism requiring supplements for at least B12 and often Iron as well since the HEMA Iron found in meat is more easily digestible than the Iron in plant foods and many people have issues absorbing the latter. Zinc, Calcium, and a couple other B Vitamins are additional points of concern. Jordan is wrong about the rich part though assuming he said it. That's my piece, my verdict stands.", "\ud83e\udd23 because I always go to my psychologist when I have dietary questions", "Don\u2019t some flavours of potato chips have animal products in them? I know that I have to look at the ingredient section of snacks before I buy them if I plan to share them with my vegetarian friends. But I agree that OP is NTA because it\u2019s not like the guy was tricked into eating vegan \u201cmeat.\u201d", "NTA does he think eating vegan food makes him less of a man?", "Nta. It\u2019s not like you substituted tofu for hamburgers or something. I\u2019m typically against these \u201ctricked people into eating my food\u201d posts because I don\u2019t think you should ever lie to people about what they\u2019re eating to prove a point. But that\u2019s not what you did. You simply had food options that happen to all be vegan.", "NTA. How did he not know that things that are made just from vegetables are vegan by themselves? And that he won't be \"infected\" by eating them\ud83e\udd2f", "NTA\n\nI thought this post was going somewhere else for a second but honestly? That all sounds like pretty normal snack and light party food. It's not your fault it didn't fit whatever preconception he had of vegan food and so he got 'tricked'.", "NTA. It's not your fault he has no tastebuds and can't tell if he is eating something that doesn't contain animal products. You didn't trick him into anything, btw. You just served food at a party that he ate without asking you about the ingredients. No tricks here.", "NTA. ruin oreos for him too and report back", "Um, cookies are not vegan usually.  Made with milk.   Sugar.  Eggs.     Not vegan usually.", "He probably only thinks vegan for fake animal products and would never equate fruits, vegetables, pasta, etc. as vegan because they are naturally vegan.", "It sounds like all he had to do was read the packaging", "I say this as a vegetarian but I still think it\u2019s wrong to trick someone into eating, for example, a beyond burger and telling them it\u2019s beef. Like yeah, it\u2019s not gonna hurt them as long as they\u2019re not allergic to the ingredients but it\u2019s still really disrespectful to slip someone something they didn\u2019t intend to eat and lie about what\u2019s in it. \n\nThat\u2019s completely different from op\u2019s situation though because she never claimed any of the food had animal products in it, Jordan was just too dumb to even consider it.", "This is the weirdest thing I've ever read... You hate the meat industry but you cooked chicken for your friends??? Huhhhh", "Oreos are vegan", "Therein lies the major stupidity of people like Jordan who rail against all vegan food as being disgusting when they almost certainly regularly consume foods that contain no animal products", "Ok, now explain the \u201cfat free watermelon\u201d displayed at my local supermarket last summer.", "Wow this is actually the stupidest shit I've read on Reddit yet", "I thought you were vegetarian, not vegan.... Very confusing..", "Uh. Is he THE Jordan Peterson?", "More like the liar king", "I once picked up a package of cheese at the grocery store that had the label \"warning, contains cheese.\" I couldn't help but chuckle and think \"I certainly hope so!\"", "If he wants atherosclerosis and cancer, congrats. It sounds like the perfect diet", "He\u2019s not even a very good psychologist. He wasn\u2019t well regarded in his field even before he got famous for his conservative caterwauling", "True,  I should have said \"some potato chips.\" My favorite flavor is the plain ones with reduced salt.  But I suppose if this guy ever comes over I'll be sure to  drizzle lard and whipped cream on them.", "Really? I didn't know that. Thanks :) But it does seem like the people with a knee jerk reaction against \"vegan\" food aren't well versed in nutrition when they freak out over food that they've always eaten when the word vegan is put in front of it.\n\nThere was a show in the UK (Eden) where they isolated a bunch of people on a peninsula so they could create their own society and bunch of men went rogue and couldn't stop slaughtering animals and acting like cavemen. The show was canceled, no idea what happened in that fucked up experiment except a bunch of men thought they could live on just slaughtering animals. It was horrific. I just don't get why men (and it ALWAYS seems to be men) think eating vegetables, pulses and grains aren't manly when they're supposed to make up 3/4 of a human diet.\n\nHow fragile is your masculinity that you can't eat veg?!", "Plain chips are just as nice as flavoured chips- I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve tried the reduced salt ones though. I\u2019m in no way vegan or vegetarian, but even I can appreciate good meat free meals."]}
