As long as pointing this out was not intentional, YNTA!!!", "What did she think was going to happen when he found out? Nta", "NTA. You didn't know she hadn't told him, and frankly, that's really a conversation they should have had before getting engaged. Your sister and mother are using you as a scapegoat.", "NTA - This situation is fairly unbelievable.\n\nIt is absolutely not okay to agree to marry somebody while hiding the fact that you can't have kids. If she had told Derek, he might have been okay with marrying her and adopting or using a surrogate. The reason their relationship ended isn't because she can't have kids, it's because she didn't tell him that and now he can't trust her.", "NTA - First of all, you had no idea. That alone makes you not the asshole. Furthermore, your sister omitted a HUGE FUCKING THING from this dude. Can they adopt? Yes. Can they use a surrogate? Sure. But can the poor guy forgive her for never telling him something so monumental? Nope. Trust is gone. You", "NTA. Who is so serious with someone they get engaged but don't tell them something this important?", "NTA any decent person would assume that your sister and her fianc\u00e9 had discussed that they would not be able to have biological children and that he was ok with it. Also there\u2019s no way to know whether he would have stuck around after getting married once he found out, which he eventually would have somehow.", "You didn't break your sisters engagement. She did by lying. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, the topic of children seems very reasonable between a man who just got engaged and his soon to be inlaws. \n\nYour sister is an idiot if she thought either the topic of children or her cancer and its concequences could be dodged forever.", "Nta you didn\u2019t know and it was an honest mistake.  I hope you are supporting your sister. I get derek being upset but your family has to cut him out so your sister can deal with how she got here", "ESH - obviously your sister shouldn\u2019t have lied and should be honest with him, so it\u2019s her fault the engagement ended, but also what a shitty thing to say to someone. Like not having children is some huge burden and that your sister needed to do more to justify him marrying her because of her ovarian cancer.", "NTA. \"The omission of the truth is a lie\". One of the greatest lines I've ever come up with. Your sister lied by omission, and Derek dodged a speeding bullet. Your sister can choose to be however open she wants, but if you're going to marry someone, the \"children\" talk must happen before the engagement.", "ESH. I think your phrasing (\"abandon having children\") was unnecessarily cruel, even if Derek had known about your sister's fertility issues. Additionally, it's also best to avoid talking about people's choices surrounding family planning, as that's a private discussion that they should be having amongst themselves (unless they bring it up first).\n\nHowever,\n> And in the eyes of my sister and mother I\u2019m the asshole who separated my sister from the love of her life.\n\nYour sister brought this upon herself. Fertility issues can be a hurdle in so many relationships, but that's something that should've been discussed way earlier than into an engagement. \n\nPerhaps if he had known previously, they could've worked out a plan to have children in some other capacity (adoption, IVF and surrogacy, etc.).\n\nQuite frankly, Derek would've found out eventually about her lie, after they were married, and a divorce would've been worse.", "NTA - this is assuming you are, in fact, telling the truth that you believed Derek knew. If you thought he didn't this is not the best way to go about letting him know (you should have checked with you sister first). \n\nThe reality is that this is a deal breaker for a lot of people but, as has been stated in this very thread, couples with infertility do still have options. If y our sister was honest about 1) her infertility and 2) whether she wanted to explore the other options with Derek then this wedding might still be happening.", "ESH. Your sister built a house of cards by avoiding the topic for a year and a half. It can safely be said she made a lie of omission to him by not disclosing that. That said, you shouldn't be sharing someone's medical history with others unless they've said it's ok to do so.", "NTA.  How were you to know she hadn't shared a huge piece of information like that to her fianc\u00e9?  That's pretty terrible of her.  The only person she can blame is herself.  You didn't do it intentionally, but thank God you did for this poor guy's sake.  It's a little strange that before proposing, he let it go that she was weird about talking about future children.  That just wasn't really smart of him.  Those are the kinds of things you need to know whether you're on the same page or not.  They could still become parents, just another way.  Still, it's so messed up she kept this from him.", "NTA, she should have discussed it with him.", "NTA\n\nShe is TA for not discussing it with him that is being deceitful and that would have been what their marriage was based on.", "NTA, unless you're a fan of Christian Horner.\n\nIt was an odd thing to say, but everyone should assume he knew this.  Sharing this sort of info is customary and expected before getting engaged - if not immediately upon it.\n\nSlight YTA for the choice in words, because they could have adopted.", "I can't believe this is true because it would mean she doesn't even get her period and is also taking hormones. Who dates someone for so long and doesn't realize that? Did they even discuss something as basic as contraception?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He said now it made sense why she always avoided discussing about children.\n\nBut he still proposed?\n\nAlso, your wording is such a poor choice; people can have children in other ways.", "NTA - but this is a fairly unbelievable story, to be fair. You're not an AH for making a mistake but you are an idiot.", "NTA. These are important conversations to have before getting engaged. It\u2019s better everyone know now. There\u2019s a chance he\u2019s perfectly fine with not having biological children or having them through surrogacy, but is more upset that she hid this. They needed to have this talk.", "Info: is he invited to watch the Austrian GP?", "ESH. Why would you say it like that?? \u201cAbandon having children?\u201d It makes it sound like you think your sister is damaged goods. Obviously, your sister is also an AH for not telling her fianc\u00e9. Poor dude.", "NTA - it could happen to anyone. I\u2019m sorry your sister and family (and you) suffered through that cancer but glad she\u2019s here and I hope she\u2019s healthy.\n\nRelationships are tricky and multilayered as we all know and you\u2019d be right to assume that the love of her life would know all there is to know.", "NTA,  so you're mom would rather spend  money on a wedding to have it either annulled or ending in divorce? Your sister brought this on herself for not divulging hwe infertility (I am so sorry she had to go through that).", "NTA. You had no malicious intentions. Besides, this topic would've been out there sooner or later. Better sooner than later.", "NTA. by the way he reacted, if he and your sister had really got married, the marriage would have ended the same way because at some point she would have to tell him that she can't have children and clearly he wants to have children. You didn't know that she didn't share this important information with her FIANCE, SOON TO BE HUSBAND ( not anymore ). Your sister and mother are the AH's for putting the blame on you when you rightfully assumed he knew something so important. Your sister should have said that because surely she knew he would want children in the future.", "NTA your sister should have had this conversation with him. You had no way of knowing she would hide this.", "INFO: Did he make it clear he really wanted children to you beforehand?", "NTA  But your sister certainly is for not telling her fianc\u00e9 that she could not have children.  That is deceitful, conniving and manipulating.  She messed up, not you.  And your mom is not winning any votes from me if she is mad at you for something your sister is responsible for.", "ESH (except poor Derek) - Obviously your sister should have discussed this with him. \n\nBut fertility issues and having children isnt a topic you bring up unless the other person does. There was zero reason to mention this to him.", "NTA. She should\u2019ve told him. How do you let someone propose to you without informing them they can\u2019t have kids. That is a major major dealbreaker for some people. Yeah it was her place to tell him.. but if they have been together that long and she told him was she just gonna lie the whole time about not being able to have kids? If anything your sister is the AH for lying and not telling the truth about it from the start.", "ESH except Derek. Your sister should have told him they wouldn\u2019t be able to have bio kids. If he was really the love of her life, she should have trusted that he would be open to alternatives to becoming parents as long as he could raise the children with her. Your family needs to stop blaming you for her deceit. As for your, even if he knew about she was unable to have children, it was inappropriate for you to bring it up. A discussion of such a sensitive topic should only be initiated by the person most affected by it. Also, you statement was incorrect. If Derek was still going to marry your sister knowing she couldn\u2019t have bio kids, that doesn\u2019t mean he abandoned the idea of having children. There are other ways to have kids other than the traditional ones.", "NTA. The guy should have been told sooner, so adoption is still on the table and he didn't have to leave.", "I think ESH except maybe Derek.\n\nYou revealed very personal medical information about your sister to a third person. I'm sure there are people who would argue \"but he is her fiance\". The fact remains that it is still very rude and extremely inappropriate to discuss a person's medical history. \n\nYour sister did hide an important piece of information from her fiance. I'm sure in doing so, she severely damaged his trust in her and I am guessing that's the major reason as to why he called off the engagement.", "NTA.\n\nYou're a villain to two, but a hero to all men.", "NTA\n\nThey are engaged, he hangs with you and your dad and seems to be fitting in with the family and you mentioned something about your sister that a soon to be married couple should know about.  It sucks that they broke up but what was her end game, not tell him until they're married and hope he doesn't find out?  A marriage built on a lie is certainly on a weak foundation for the very reason they broke up now.  Your sister is likely mad at herself but it's easier to blame you.  If someone wants to keep a secret, its best all the people that know about it are told to keep quiet (but in that case it would make your sister seem more devious)", "ESH (you and your sister)\n\nShe should have discussed it with him, and you should have avoided that topic.", "ESH for joking about your sisters CANCER when you don't know what discussions have been had. who just casually says \"oh yeah, good for you that you don't care my sister had cancer and had to remove bodily organs\" like, what are you even trying to do? they should've discussed it but you have no right to bring up your sisters medical history willy-nilly. even if they HAD discussed it, thus would be so hurtful and cruel.", "ESH\n\nThere\u2019s something kinda sexist and gross underpinning your comment, like her inability to have children is some huge disadvantage and \u201coh how wonderful that you can look past her glaring flaw\u201d.\n\nShe should have had that discussion but you shouldn\u2019t have discussed it", "NTA how long was she planning on keeping it a secret. She probably thought she was going to manipulate him into adoption", "NAH; I want to say Y T A bc the sentiment you expressed is kinda gross but he clearly agreed with you & so you may have saved them a bitter divorce\n\nAlso: you didn't break up their engagement, your sister's caginess did. Maybe she'd have said something during the engagement, and maybe he'd have been receptive, but the reality is she dodged the question of kids with him enough that your statement made her avoidance click into place so I think the lit was already dug regardless", "ESH. You fucked up dropping that kind of info on him, it's more fucked up that your sister withheld it, and frankly while Derek definitely isn't the bad guy here if he wants kids why is his dumbass getting engaged to a woman without *ever* bringing the topic up to her? Forget infertility what if she just didn't *want* kids? He was gonna plan to marry her with kids being a requirement for him but wait until after the wedding to find out if she was also up for it?\n\nAs for you being the reason they broke up, I dunno, what was your sister's long term plan? Hide it from him until they started trying for a baby and she couldn't do it and act like it was a surprise to her as well? Build their relationship on deceit? Hope he just didn't want kids but without actually having that conversation before getting engaged? It's hard to envision the version of events where you didn't say what you said and therefore they end up staying together in the long run.\n\nEdit: y'know come to think about it, since Derek was dumb enough to get engaged to a woman he wants to have kids with but *never* confirm she even wants kids too, maybe to give your sister some credit she was also dumb enough to just assume Derek *didn't* want kids. I dunno, whole situation is fucked up.", "So many kids need to be adopted\u2026there are multiple ways to be a parent.", "i dont think you are the A in this becuase it just slipped and derek should have pressed for an answer when he asked about having kids when she avoided discussing.  better to know now than after the wedding when they would divorce.", "NTA, your sister should've told him a long time ago and she is the ultimate asshole here, but this begs the question... did Derek never bring it up, either? Kinda an important thing to talk about if you're planning to propose to someone. He's partially responsible as well.\n\nEdit: I'll leave my comment but I read that post way too fast, he did bring it up, she avoided it. Now she's really the asshole here. Maybe he should have pressed the issue, but absolutely, 100%, she should have told him when he brought that up. Not doing so was a clear lie by omission, and now he's rightfully upset at being lied to.", "NTA. People may be upset you were the one who broke the news about your sister\u2019s fertility, but that should have been discussed much earlier in the relationship. How did she think it would work if she didn\u2019t tell him? Was she going to avoid the topic until she was married? Your sister was avoiding reality. You weren\u2019t divulging top secret information.", "NTA - Did everyone think he would never find out?  Or, even worse, did they want them to get married before he found out so that he would have to divorce her and maybe he would stay in the marriage?\n\nMany reasons why you are NTA here, not the least of which is that you correctly assumed he knew already and no one told you otherwise.\n\nYour sister and mother need to examine their motivations here.  Clearly there are options for people who cannot conceive but pretending you can isn't one of them.", "NTA\n\nIt's the type of info one could reasonably expect she would have shared with her fiance-now-ex, since it directly impacts the life and family projects of the couple. So such a \"slip\" from you doesn't make you an AH.", "ESH besides Derek. Your sister needed to have this discussion with Derek before getting engaged. You I would classify as a soft AH because you told Derek when it wasn\u2019t your discussion to have ( I know you didn\u2019t know he didn\u2019t know that\u2019s why I say soft AH) would have been good for you to talk to your sister before hand to make sure she has had the discussion with Derek.", "Separate now or divorce later - choose your poison.", "If that is the language you used, you did it on purpose.\n\nEtA", "NTA. You'd have to ask Derek, but chances are the issue is not even the infertility at all but the fact that she didn't tell him.", "ESH- Quite frankly she did it to herself by not telling him as soon as things started to get serious, She should have known it would come out eventually and the fact that she didn't tell him leads me to believe she would've went through with the marriage without disclosing this. That makes her a major AH. \n\nHowever, why did you bring that up? It almost seems like you did it out of spite to say \"how could you possibly want to be with her when she can't give you kids?\". Even if he did know, that's such a huge slap in the face to her and you had no valid reason to talk about that with him.", "ESH. I mean it's insensitive comment, apparently you've never heard them discuss having children - so even if he was aware, he may've still been unwilling to talk about this. Know in the future you should refrain from opening discussions of similar matter.\n\nBut in the end you made him a favour and saved everyone troubles of the wedding and the subsequent divorce, so don't feel very guilty.", "I think I'll be in the minority but very soft YTA. \n\nI don't believe you meant the comment in a hurtful way. I think that you probably meant it in a complimentary way. However, that's a subject for your sister and Derek to discuss and may be sort of painful. Maybe not something to bring up in casual conversation. Also, if he HAD known, he's not \"abandoning\" having children. They could adopt. \n\nYour sister is most definitely an AH for avoiding the topic and not disclosing to Derek that she cannot have children naturally.  I also think your mom is being an AH for making you feel bad. \n\nSo in conclusion I guess ESH. Smh", "Your sister is the only AH in this scenario. NTA. Imagine how bad it would have been if he found out post-wedding. It sucks that you were the one that dropped the bomb on him but there was no way you could have known your sister had kept that from him.", "YTA. It's beyond me how so many people are saying otherwise.\n\nLike, I don't know what would possess someone to say what you did in casual conversation??\n\nIt was something for them to discuss as a couple and you destroyed their relationship by bringing up something you seriously had no business bringing up.\n\nThis was something for your sister to address, not you.\n\nEven if they had spoken about it, that's just a really messed up thing to say to someone.", "YTA, that's not your place to tell him.  Even though he needed to know.  That was a private discussion for him and your sister.", "YTA. That was a conversation for them to have when it actually came to having children and she needed to say it to him herself. You just caused drama, especially saying it like that (which is a dick thing to say anyway cos you're assuming all couples want kids).", "YTA.

Yes she should've been up front about it but if kids were an absolute *requirement* for Derek in a marriage why the fuck was he getting engaged to a woman without confirming she also wants kids?

Maybe she just assumed, without *ever* discussing it with him, that Derek *didn't* want kids and as such just figured it was no big deal that she couldn't have kids.

If OP was assuming anything, it's reasonable to assume his sister was honest with her fiance about such a major compatibility aspect as agreeing on family planning prior to engagement.

Even if you hadn\u2019t been directly involved in the end of their relationship (accidentally or not), it would be an odd thing to do. \n\nIt\u2019s not like you knew this guy before they dated. He\u2019s not your childhood best friend who happened to date your sister. He\u2019s some guy who left after finding out she couldn\u2019t have kids. \n\n(And before anyone argues, yes, the sister should have told the fianc\u00e9 and they both should\u2019ve had a serious discussion about kids prior to getting engaged, hence my judgement.) \n\nPoint being, you\u2019re acting cold-hearted towards your sister and doing this going to hurt your relationship with her even more. On top of that, your dad is right; it is in poor taste.", "To be fair though, we have no idea how the subject came up.

There\u2019s other options regarding family planning and maybe he would have been open to those options if she told him from the beginning. But if she\u2019s able to lie about that, what else can she lie about?", "I understand. We can't know for sure.

The only one who can honestly hold fault is the one who lied the entire time. That's important information to withhold, and the guy had a right to know. It impacts his life. How long was she going to string him along and avoid disclosing such pertinent information? I can't even blame OP for his statement since anyone would reasonably believe they'd already discussed it. She may have brought him into her family's life, but that doesn't mean she has the right to remove him from their lives. Especially since it was her own doing.", "But the wording is so awful. There are other ways to have kids, and to act like his sister is damaged goods because she had CANCER is beyond fucked up. That wording just tells me OP thinks his sister isn't worth marrying and Derek must REALLY love her to tolerate such an enormous flaw. It's disgusting.", "I have coworkers telling me life stories after a couple months time working together. People absolutely talk about these things unprompted.

Sister was avoiding the kids conversation, it\u2019s not like the fianc\u00e9 never asked her about it. So yes, she was lying by omission every time he tried to talk to her about it and she avoided it.

Regardless of translation issues, letting the fianc\u00e9 know that his sister can't have kids is where everything went downhill.", "Most of the other options are extremely expensive and time consuming though. Let's not pretend like it's so easy to adopt, or conceive using a surrogate. Maybe Derek doesn't want to spend 10 years with lawyers or $100k to have a child, especially when he didn't even know the normal option for conceiving wasn't a possibility.", "If it not happening was an absolute deal-breaker then a \"possibility\" it *would* happen shouldn't be enough for you to propose is my point.

Point is it's a good lesson in communication and knowing what you want.", "Why propose if a topic so important to you is *never* discussed?", "Maybe, but its nowhere near as weird as not letting your future husband know you suffered childhood cancer and are unable to have children.

I totally get that. Hard way to learn that lesson, but at least he found out now.\n\nPersonally, for me it wouldn't be the inability to have children together that would be the deal breaker for me.

If she had been upfront and honest, then this situation would've never come about.", "I agree, it should have been discussed. She at least should have told him she doesn't want to birth any children. But keep in mind, having childhood cancer is extremely traumatic and she may not have wanted to talk about it. That's completely within her rights.

He likely did do both of those things, but if someone is avoiding talking about something you can\u2019t make them talk about it. And do you know what a lie by omission is? She lied by omission because she did not tell him the reason why she was avoiding the kids conversation. Depending on how often he tried to talk to her he likely decided to stop pushing and assumed she would talk to him about it when she\u2019s ready. That\u2019s probably why he still wanted to marry her. The fianc\u00e9 is not to blame for the sister\u2019s lies, she needs therapy not a husband.", "\"To assume makes an ass out of you and me\" sounds like he made himself into an ass.", "Um sorry but no. It may not be something they need to disclose to everyone they meet, but when you are in a committed relationship and planning on *marrying* someone, that is absolutely information you need to share.", "But how was he to know that she hadn't? In OPs defense, it's so obvious that something so deeply life changing as cancer as a teenager would have been shared with someone who you've been dating for years and engaged to. Sisters cancer was probably THE biggest issue of the family that impacted them all in different ways as he too was a child when it happened. How on earth do you get to the engagement part of life without the kids discussion? And it's clear from the fiance's reaction that he had no idea. None. OP is NTA because he didn't know his sister was keeping a massive secret.", "OP is perfectly justified in expecting fianc\u00e9 to know about the fertility issue.  But, he still shouldn\u2019t have said it, so ESH.  But sister is a HUGE ah, OP just a foolish one.

You dont do that.\n\nIt saved a couple from getting divorced. Strange you want another divorce to happen.", "He\u2019s still an asshole because of how he spoke about his sister.  The break up of their engagement is not the OP\u2019s fault, but what he said would have still been awful even if the fianc\u00e9 was aware of the sister\u2019s and fine with her not being able to birth children.   He talked about her like she\u2019s defective and was lucky to have found someone willing to find someone willing to look past it.  That\u2019s a really shitty way to talk about anyone who struggles with fertility, never mind someone who was made that way because of cancer.", "You don't think that dodging the subject by saying something like the person you replied said is avoiding the topic?

I think a lie is a lie, and that evasion is evasion . I would never have done what she did, because I think that it\u2019s not good to not be forthcoming and honest about your life and important life decisions with your future partner, but he entirely didn\u2019t press on the subject whatsoever. \n\nShe has trauma and an immense amount at that, and clearly hasn\u2019t worked through her issues, and her ex fianc\u00e9 clearly did not care enough about having kids to inquire when she put up a wall, and he clearly didn\u2019t care enough about her as to ask her why she was putting up that wall"]}
