As long as pointing this out was not intentional, YNTA!!!", "What did she think was going to happen when he found out? Nta", "NTA. You didn't know she hadn't told him, and frankly, that's really a conversation they should have had before getting engaged. Your sister and mother are using you as a scapegoat.", "NTA - This situation is fairly unbelievable.\n\nIt is absolutely not okay to agree to marry somebody while hiding the fact that you can't have kids. If she had told Derek, he might have been okay with marrying her and adopting or using a surrogate. The reason their relationship ended isn't because she can't have kids, it's because she didn't tell him that and now he can't trust her.", "NTA - First of all, you had no idea. That alone makes you not the asshole. Furthermore, your sister omitted a HUGE FUCKING THING from this dude. Can they adopt? Yes. Can they use a surrogate? Sure. But can the poor guy forgive her for never telling him something so monumental? Nope. Trust is gone. You", "NTA. Who is so serious with someone they get engaged but don't tell them something this important?", "NTA any decent person would assume that your sister and her fianc\u00e9 had discussed that they would not be able to have biological children and that he was ok with it. Also there\u2019s no way to know whether he would have stuck around after getting married once he found out, which he eventually would have somehow.", "You didn't break your sisters engagement. She did by lying. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, the topic of children seems very reasonable between a man who just got engaged and his soon to be inlaws. \n\nYour sister is an idiot if she thought either the topic of children or her cancer and its concequences could be dodged forever.", "Nta you didn\u2019t know and it was an honest mistake.  I hope you are supporting your sister. I get derek being upset but your family has to cut him out so your sister can deal with how she got here", "ESH - obviously your sister shouldn\u2019t have lied and should be honest with him, so it\u2019s her fault the engagement ended, but also what a shitty thing to say to someone. Like not having children is some huge burden and that your sister needed to do more to justify him marrying her because of her ovarian cancer.", "NTA. \"The omission of the truth is a lie\". One of the greatest lines I've ever come up with. Your sister lied by omission, and Derek dodged a speeding bullet. Your sister can choose to be however open she wants, but if you're going to marry someone, the \"children\" talk must happen before the engagement.", "ESH. I think your phrasing (\"abandon having children\") was unnecessarily cruel, even if Derek had known about your sister's fertility issues. Additionally, it's also best to avoid talking about people's choices surrounding family planning, as that's a private discussion that they should be having amongst themselves (unless they bring it up first).\n\nHowever,\n> And in the eyes of my sister and mother I\u2019m the asshole who separated my sister from the love of her life.\n\nYour sister brought this upon herself. Fertility issues can be a hurdle in so many relationships, but that's something that should've been discussed way earlier than into an engagement. \n\nPerhaps if he had known previously, they could've worked out a plan to have children in some other capacity (adoption, IVF and surrogacy, etc.).\n\nQuite frankly, Derek would've found out eventually about her lie, after they were married, and a divorce would've been worse.", "NTA - this is assuming you are, in fact, telling the truth that you believed Derek knew. If you thought he didn't this is not the best way to go about letting him know (you should have checked with you sister first). \n\nThe reality is that this is a deal breaker for a lot of people but, as has been stated in this very thread, couples with infertility do still have options. If y our sister was honest about 1) her infertility and 2) whether she wanted to explore the other options with Derek then this wedding might still be happening.", "ESH. Your sister built a house of cards by avoiding the topic for a year and a half. It can safely be said she made a lie of omission to him by not disclosing that. That said, you shouldn't be sharing someone's medical history with others unless they've said it's ok to do so.", "NTA.  How were you to know she hadn't shared a huge piece of information like that to her fianc\u00e9?  That's pretty terrible of her.  The only person she can blame is herself.  You didn't do it intentionally, but thank God you did for this poor guy's sake.  It's a little strange that before proposing, he let it go that she was weird about talking about future children.  That just wasn't really smart of him.  Those are the kinds of things you need to know whether you're on the same page or not.  They could still become parents, just another way.  Still, it's so messed up she kept this from him.", "NTA, she should have discussed it with him.", "NTA\n\nShe is TA for not discussing it with him that is being deceitful and that would have been what their marriage was based on.", "NTA, unless you're a fan of Christian Horner.\n\nIt was an odd thing to say, but everyone should assume he knew this.  Sharing this sort of info is customary and expected before getting engaged - if not immediately upon it.\n\nSlight YTA for the choice in words, because they could have adopted.", "I can't believe this is true because it would mean she doesn't even get her period and is also taking hormones. Who dates someone for so long and doesn't realize that? Did they even discuss something as basic as contraception?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He said now it made sense why she always avoided discussing about children.\n\nBut he still proposed?\n\nAlso, your wording is such a poor choice; people can have children in other ways.", "NTA - but this is a fairly unbelievable story, to be fair. You're not an AH for making a mistake but you are an idiot.", "NTA. These are important conversations to have before getting engaged. It\u2019s better everyone know now. There\u2019s a chance he\u2019s perfectly fine with not having biological children or having them through surrogacy, but is more upset that she hid this. They needed to have this talk.", "Info: is he invited to watch the Austrian GP?", "ESH. Why would you say it like that?? \u201cAbandon having children?\u201d It makes it sound like you think your sister is damaged goods. Obviously, your sister is also an AH for not telling her fianc\u00e9. Poor dude.", "NTA - it could happen to anyone. I\u2019m sorry your sister and family (and you) suffered through that cancer but glad she\u2019s here and I hope she\u2019s healthy.\n\nRelationships are tricky and multilayered as we all know and you\u2019d be right to assume that the love of her life would know all there is to know.", "NTA,  so you're mom would rather spend  money on a wedding to have it either annulled or ending in divorce? Your sister brought this on herself for not divulging hwe infertility (I am so sorry she had to go through that).", "NTA. You had no malicious intentions. Besides, this topic would've been out there sooner or later. Better sooner than later.", "NTA. by the way he reacted, if he and your sister had really got married, the marriage would have ended the same way because at some point she would have to tell him that she can't have children and clearly he wants to have children. You didn't know that she didn't share this important information with her FIANCE, SOON TO BE HUSBAND ( not anymore ). Your sister and mother are the AH's for putting the blame on you when you rightfully assumed he knew something so important. Your sister should have said that because surely she knew he would want children in the future.", "NTA your sister should have had this conversation with him. You had no way of knowing she would hide this.", "INFO: Did he make it clear he really wanted children to you beforehand?", "NTA  But your sister certainly is for not telling her fianc\u00e9 that she could not have children.  That is deceitful, conniving and manipulating.  She messed up, not you.  And your mom is not winning any votes from me if she is mad at you for something your sister is responsible for.", "ESH (except poor Derek) - Obviously your sister should have discussed this with him. \n\nBut fertility issues and having children isnt a topic you bring up unless the other person does. There was zero reason to mention this to him.", "NTA. She should\u2019ve told him. How do you let someone propose to you without informing them they can\u2019t have kids. That is a major major dealbreaker for some people. Yeah it was her place to tell him.. but if they have been together that long and she told him was she just gonna lie the whole time about not being able to have kids? If anything your sister is the AH for lying and not telling the truth about it from the start.", "ESH except Derek. Your sister should have told him they wouldn\u2019t be able to have bio kids. If he was really the love of her life, she should have trusted that he would be open to alternatives to becoming parents as long as he could raise the children with her. Your family needs to stop blaming you for her deceit. As for your, even if he knew about she was unable to have children, it was inappropriate for you to bring it up. A discussion of such a sensitive topic should only be initiated by the person most affected by it. Also, you statement was incorrect. If Derek was still going to marry your sister knowing she couldn\u2019t have bio kids, that doesn\u2019t mean he abandoned the idea of having children. There are other ways to have kids other than the traditional ones.", "NTA. The guy should have been told sooner, so adoption is still on the table and he didn't have to leave.", "I think ESH except maybe Derek.\n\nYou revealed very personal medical information about your sister to a third person. I'm sure there are people who would argue \"but he is her fiance\". The fact remains that it is still very rude and extremely inappropriate to discuss a person's medical history. \n\nYour sister did hide an important piece of information from her fiance. I'm sure in doing so, she severely damaged his trust in her and I am guessing that's the major reason as to why he called of the engagement.", "NTA.\n\nYou're a villain to two, but a hero to all men.", "NTA\n\nThey are engaged, he hangs with you and your dad and seems to be fitting in with the family and you mentioned something about your sister that a soon to be married couple should know about.  It sucks that they broke up but what was her end game, not tell him until they're married and hope he doesn't find out?  A marriage built on a lie is certainly on a weak foundation for the very reason they broke up now.  Your sister is likely mad at herself but it's easier to blame you.  If someone wants to keep a secret, its best all the people that know about it are told to keep quiet (but in that case it would make your sister seem more devious)", "ESH (you and your sister)\n\nShe should have discussed it with him, and you should have avoided that topic.", "ESH for joking about your sisters CANCER when you don't know what discussions have been had. who just casually says \"oh yeah, good for you that you don't care my sister had cancer and had to remove bodily organs\" like, what are you even trying to do? they should've discussed it but you have no right to bring up your sisters medical history willy-nilly. even if they HAD discussed it, thus would be so hurtful and cruel.", "ESH\n\nThere\u2019s something kinda sexist and gross underpinning your comment, like her inability to have children is some huge disadvantage and \u201coh how wonderful that you can look past her glaring flaw\u201d.\n\nShe should have had that discussion but you shouldn\u2019t have discussed it", "NTA how long was she planning on keeping it a secret. She probably thought she was going to manipulate him into adoption", "NAH; I want to say Y T A bc the sentiment you expressed is kinda gross but he clearly agreed with you & so you may have saved them a bitter divorce\n\nAlso: you didn't break up their engagement, your sister's caginess did. Maybe she'd have said something during the engagement, and maybe he'd have been receptive, but the reality is she dodged the question of kids with him enough that your statement made her avoidance click into place so I think the lit was already dug regardless", "ESH. You fucked up dropping that kind of info on him, it's more fucked up that your sister withheld it, and frankly while Derek definitely isn't the bad guy here if he wants kids why is his dumbass getting engaged to a woman without *ever* bringing the topic up to her? Forget infertility what if she just didn't *want* kids? He was gonna plan to marry her with kids being a requirement for him but wait until after the wedding to find out if she was also up for it?\n\nAs for you being the reason they broke up, I dunno, what was your sister's long term plan? Hide it from him until they started trying for a baby and she couldn't do it and act like it was a surprise to her as well? Build their relationship on deceit? Hope he just didn't want kids but without actually having that conversation before getting engaged? It's hard to envision the version of events where you didn't say what you said and therefore they end up staying together in the long run.\n\nEdit: y'know come to think about it, since Derek was dumb enough to get engaged to a woman he wants to have kids with but *never* confirm she even wants kids too, maybe to give your sister some credit she was also dumb enough to just assume Derek *didn't* want kids. I dunno, whole situation is fucked up.", "So many kids need to be adopted\u2026there are multiple ways to be a parent.", "i dont think you are the A in this becuase it just slipped and derek should have pressed for an answer when he asked about having kids when she avoided discussing.  better to know now than after the wedding when they would divorce.", "NTA, your sister should've told him a long time ago and she is the ultimate asshole here, but this begs the question... did Derek never bring it up, either? Kinda an important thing to talk about if you're planning to propose to someone. He's partially responsible as well.\n\nEdit: I'll leave my comment but I read that post way too fast, he did bring it up, she avoided it. Now she's really the asshole here. Maybe he should have pressed the issue, but absolutely, 100%, she should have told him when he brought that up. Not doing so was a clear lie by omission, and now he's rightfully upset at being lied to.", "NTA. People may be upset you were the one who broke the news about your sister\u2019s fertility, but that should have been discussed much earlier in the relationship. How did she think it would work if she didn\u2019t tell him? Was she going to avoid the topic until she was married? Your sister was avoiding reality. You weren\u2019t divulging top secret information.", "NTA - Did everyone think he would never find out?  Or, even worse, did they want them to get married before he found out so that he would have to divorce her and maybe he would stay in the marriage?\n\nMany reasons why you are NTA here, not the least of which is that you correctly assumed he knew already and no one told you otherwise.\n\nYour sister and mother need to examine their motivations here.  Clearly there are options for people who cannot conceive but pretending you can isn't one of them.", "NTA\n\nIt's the type of info one could reasonably expect she would have shared with her fiance-now-ex, since it directly impacts the life and family projects of the couple. So such a \"slip\" from you doesn't make you an AH.", "ESH besides Derek. Your sister needed to have this discussion with Derek before getting engaged. You I would classify as a soft AH because you told Derek when it wasn\u2019t your discussion to have ( I know you didn\u2019t know he didn\u2019t know that\u2019s why I say soft AH) would have been good for you to talk to your sister before hand to make sure she has had the discussion with Derek.", "Separate now or divorce later - choose your poison.", "If that is the language you used, you did it on purpose.\n\nEtA", "NTA. You'd have to ask Derek, but chances are the issue is not even the infertility at all but the fact that she didn't tell him.", "ESH- Quite frankly she did it to herself by not telling him as soon as things started to get serious, She should have known it would come out eventually and the fact that she didn't tell him leads me to believe she would've went through with the marriage without disclosing this. That makes her a major AH. \n\nHowever, why did you bring that up? It almost seems like you did it out of spite to say \"how could you possibly want to be with her when she can't give you kids?\". Even if he did know, that's such a huge slap in the face to her and you had no valid reason to talk about that with him.", "ESH. I mean it's insensitive comment, apparently you've never heard them discuss having children - so even if he was aware, he may've still been unwilling to talk about this. Know in the future you should refrain from opening discussions of similar matter.\n\nBut in the end you made him a favour and saved everyone troubles of the wedding and the subsequent divorce, so don't feel very guilty.", "I think I'll be in the minority but very soft YTA. \n\nI don't believe you meant the comment in a hurtful way. I think that you probably meant it in a complimentary way. However, that's a subject for your sister and Derek to discuss and may be sort of painful. Maybe not something to bring up in casual conversation. Also, if he HAD known, he's not \"abandoning\" having children. They could adopt. \n\nYour sister is most definitely an AH for avoiding the topic and not disclosing to Derek that she cannot have children naturally.  I also think your mom is being an AH for making you feel bad. \n\nSo in conclusion I guess ESH. Smh", "Your sister is the only AH in this scenario. NTA. Imagine how bad it would have been if he found out post-wedding. It sucks that you were the one that dropped the bomb on him but there was no way you could have known your sister had kept that from him.", "YTA. It's beyond me how so many people are saying otherwise.\n\nLike, I don't know what would possess someone to say what you did in casual conversation??\n\nIt was something for them to discuss as a couple and you destroyed their relationship by bringing up something you seriously had no business bringing up.\n\nThis was something for your sister to address, not you.\n\nEven if they had spoken about it, that's just a really messed up thing to say to someone.", "YTA, that's not your place to tell him.  Even though he needed to know.  That was a private discussion for him and your sister.", "YTA. That was a conversation for them to have when it actually came to having children and she needed to say it to him herself. You just caused drama, especially saying it like that (which is a dick thing to say anyway cos you're assuming all couples want kids).", "YTA.  That was a terrible thing to say.\n\nJust because your sister is also an AH does not mean you are not one.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yes she should've been up front about it but if kids were an absolute *requirement* for Derek in a marriage why the fuck was he getting engaged to a woman without confirming she also wants kids?

The expectation of kids/no kids convo is normal; it is a common prerequisite for engagement. \n\nOP, NTA. Your sister was being dishonest. If this truly is the love of her life, they will come back together. But it sounds like they are fundamentally incompatible and sis was in denial in her race to the alter. Better a broken engagement than a divorce.", "Right?! Why is everyone saying NTA. talking about your sister\u2019s fertility is wildly inappropriate! Intentionally or not!\n\nThe point here isn\u2019t whether OP\u2019e sister told Derek or not - that\u2019s their business. Not yours!", "The fact they were engaged and she still hadn't brought it up to that point was a huge red flag for Derek after he found out. It was either going to be right at that moment or early on in their marriage when he decided to leave after finding out.", "Was OP supposed to assume their sister was keeping significant secrets from her fianc\u00e9 ?", "I see where your coming from, but from the information I gathered, OP did not know they had not spoken about it previously. It seems they tried to make a light joke about it. No bad intentions from OP.", "no no no absolutely not no. you can't wait till after a marriage and years of commitment to finally admit you're not compatible and have been wasting your partners time for years. NTA would've been disgusting to allow him to marry without telling him, I also don't believe the sister didn't lie to her fianc\u00e9 about kids because that's definitely something people talk about before proposing.", "what???? absolutely not! this is a conversation to have before legally tying yourself to a person. divorce is expensive.\nthe sister was tricking her ex and OP is NTA", "When would've happen since they were allready engaged and planed the wedding. The sister is TAH for not telling Derek she can't have them every time derek tried to talk with her about childrens. And it is clearly that Derek wanted childrens .", "What are you talking about", "NTA op. How were you supposed to know. Your sister never told him and she obviously never told you guys that she didn't tell him.\n\nMove along dude this has no importance here.", "\u2026so you noticed that too?\n\nWould be some clever viral marketing", "\u201cDamaged goods\u201d is a really fucked up way to talk about a woman who went through cancer and can no longer have children because of it. Extremely insensitive.\n\nI don\u2019t agree with the sister not telling him this, because it can be a deal breaker and that\u2019s a huge thing to keep from someone, but seriously.", "Um, unless he was sitting there talking about how much he desperately wants kids, not appropriate terminology. Does everyone strongly want kids and marrying someone without ovaries would be *abandoning* their dreams? No. Did Derek bring up kids? Not according to OP\u2019s retelling. Do we even know if Derek wanted kids? No. OP just says they said it out of the blue. That\u2019s an AH thing to say and an AH way to say it. Why would Derek see the woman he was marrying as damaged goods??", "Even some gay women, as who will be pregnant with children is an important discussion too.", "The example you gave isnt analogous to \u201cabandoning having kids\u201d. If they moved to Alaska I assume that would be widely discussed.", "They've been together for a year and a half, some months of that being engaged... just because it hadn't been discussed yet, doesn't mean it wasn't going to be.\n\nEither way, what he said was an AH thing to say and telling someone \"its great you found someone you love so much that you would abandon having children\" isn't a compliment.", "Who goes around discussing another person's medical information?  OP is the AH for doing that, let alone spilling the secret.   OP probably has liability for Alienation of Affection or something similar.", "Thats not a *light joke*. Thats a heavy topic.", "Perhaps you're right, but it's no excuse for revealing someone's medical information.", "She should look the FIL in his eyes and ask him \"Was it acceptable for YOU to touch Your aunt's breast and kiss her on the mouth, when you were a small child? No? Then why is it ok for him too?\"", "Yeah. It was just weird. Multiple, unrelated threads, but all mentioned watching or attending F1.  Only one I remember was the fact it was F1 even relevant, and there just barely, but they all seem like they have to mention it.", "I\u2019m aware of that. I\u2019m only using it because I\u2019m trying to explain why there\u2019s nothing wrong with what OP said. Because whilst using the words damaged goods is wrong, the concept of it applies exactly here. It\u2019s just the words that are horrible. I do not and would not use it normally.", "Nah, if op is an AH then it should be marked EHS \n\nYou don\u2019t marry somebody and then tell them you\u2019re infertile", "I read it more as starting with \"I know you wanted children, but clearly you love my sister more than the idea of children and I'm glad of this!\"  Its not like OP started with \"that time my sister had that massive life changing surgery - you weren't there, but these are the details...\"", "yes, but a heavy topic isn't a bad thing.  It sounds like OP wanted Derek to know that he was grateful that his sister had a great guy like Derek.  Maybe a little ham handed, but OP was not out of line.", "@No_Call2833 wrong post lol", "> know you wanted children, but clearly you love my sister more than the idea of children and I'm glad of this\n\nThats kind of what i meant. I don\u2019t remember what i said exactly because i was a bit tipsy and it wasn\u2019t the primary concern..", "Im happy Derek found out because he needed to know but this should not have just been dropped in his lap like this.", "Don't worry you're good, but your sister is TAH if she knew Derek wanted children and didn't tell him she can't have them.", "I don't think that is OP's fault though."]}
