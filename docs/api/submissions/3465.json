I said that they were the ones who didn't want to be part of my family traditions, I was just trying to be respectful, and when they wanted to, I did my best to include them.

Then after they guilt you, when you try to make it right, they don't want them? \n\nOnce you've cooled down, I think you need to have a serious talk to clear the air and move forward. They clearly feel sad for being left out of special traditions that you didn't let them know about beforehand but you didn't do it with malice, just trying to respect their mother and your role in their lives.

Thus you applied family traditions to your bio daughters only, as per their wishes. \nThey can't have it both ways now that they saw those traditions involved some pretty lovely and costly gifts.", "NTA. They definitely want to have their cake and eat it, too. They chose to have a mother-daughter relationship with D, and explicitly not with you.

Absolutely, but only to point where the kids have set boundaries - which they did and you respected. And you do not need to keep doing that at all once they are adults.", "NTA.

You have a different bond with your daughter. I'm sure they don't treat you on the same level as they do their own mother.", "NTA.

That\u2019s their responsibility. \n\nWhile I think the sentiment that you\u2019re \u201cnever going to include them again\u201d was a bit hyperbolic, it\u2019s not unreasonable to need to set a firmer boundary with them. I don\u2019t necessarily think you need to verbally walk that back right now, though. Instead, it would be better to get some time and distance from them and think about how, assuming they use this as a wake up call to change, you want to move forward.", "NTA - you respected your stepkid's wishes, if they changed their minds then it's their job to communicate it with you.

It could have been just a kind gesture that is reflective of you and your character, and even if they were unappreciative, you still went out of your way to include them, making you the bigger person, but taking them back does make you asshole-ish. \n\nBut it was kind of you to include them even after having them establish a relationship that does not require you to make that gesture.", "If I understand you correctly, you took back gifts from your grandkids because their moms were AH. If that\u2019s the case then you are an AH for that. Telling your stepdaughters off might have been the right thing to do but taking back the children\u2019s gifts weren\u2019t.

Well, it doesn't work that way.  You were VERY respectful of them (i.e., not wanting to overstep).

Edit: typos", "It honestly sounds like they are jealous of the love and attention your daughter is receiving for having a baby and getting married.

Did they just expect you to treat your daughter the same way that they wanted to be treated.\n\n\nThey are already accusing you of treating your grandchild differently, when they were the ones who wanted the same boundaries for their kids as they had for themselves.  \n\nThey are hurt over a tradition your own mom started for you, and are mad that they were not part of the same tradition when they never wanted you to be a mother to them.\n\n\nSo now they think things are unfair for their kids and for themselves because your daughter having a kid and getting married showed them that they missed out on having a caring bonus mom.\n\n\nI would straight up tell them that you have done nothing but respect their boundaries and feelings in regards to being their dads wife.  That your relationship with your own daughter is much different than your relationship with them.  That they can't expect you to go out of your way to include them in the motherly traditions of your family when they have repeatedly treated you as nothing but their fathers wife.", "NTA.

You are describing a huge discrepancy in gifts-- and then high expectations for what you did make them. That they hesitate to accept them when they might already have complicated feelings isn't necessarily a bad response depending on your history and what your actual relationship is like.-- is there a rougher relationship than you share?", "Edit- Your step-daughters suck.

They want the goods without having to put in the work of a relationship.", "I know that they were too young then to make a definitive decision, that was why I revisited it when L got married, and they *both* reasserted that I was not their parent, just their father's wife.

I just want no part in them jerking me around again.", "I had to cut off a lot of my original post (it was almost 5k words), but here are some answers that might seem relevant to you:\n\nFirst the wedding gifts: I got L a set of copper pots and pans (one of the pricier gifts) and for J I paid for a week in a resort for her honeymoon (they couldn't afford one, D paid the plane tickets).\n\nBridal shower gifts: I got them the same thing, bridal robes with their names embroidered on the back.\n\nBaby shower gifts: I have 5 grandkids, so it's easier to say that I bought gifts costing at least $200 for each kid.\n\nI said burdening them, because including someone in an unwanted tradition is an emotional burden, by doing that you are burdening them with the expectation of fostering a closer relationship than what they might want.\n\nAnd I have a good relationship with them, not as close as what I have with my kids or what they have with their mom, but a good one. And I wanted a closer one, D wanted us to have a closer one, my husband and my kids did too, but they didn't. And I respected that.", "I had to cut off some things due to word count limit, but they had an idea of what they were missing, they knew about the journal (they saw mine multiple times and knew I had ones for my kids). Also I asked them of they wanted me to be more involved when they were older (20s) and they didn't, that's why they asked me to be just a guest during their weddings, and why I wasn't asked to help organise/host their showers, nor was I involved in their pregnancies.", ">We had another discussion again, when they were 22 and 20, and they wanted the relationship to stay the same.\n\nIt was revisited when the girls were adults. They reiterated maintaining the status quo. These two are the AHs for deciding to flip the script when they see the \"benefits\" of OP behaving as a parent to them, as opposed to an aunt. Nope, that's not how it works, and they don't get extra kindness after this behavior. They shat their beds and now get to lay in them.", "As young kids, I can go for them not understanding what they might be passing up, and their mom having personal reasons for wanting the relationship to be the way it ended up, when she would have been the real decision maker.\n\nAs adults. Naw. They don't get the free pass. They made their choice and had years of relationship to consider in making it. I'd not be surprised if they didn't even bother to ask what your offer would mean. ie. They just assumed it would be you duplicating what they already had with their mom.\n\nIt sounds like they're just salty that they noped out of something cool without realizing it. It also sounds like their own mom hasn't done anything like this for them either, and they may also be realizing that too. With some displacement onto you over it.\n\nThey had their choice. Monty Hall offered them doors number 1, 2 and 3. They chose door number 1 twice.

My advice- approach them now not with apology, but a going back to the drawing board request, what is their exact expectation of your relationship with them, and with their kids now? Is it the same as before? Do they detect a change of heart on their end? Why? How do they wanna express it to you now?

Go touch some grass.", "Just offering another perspective here, as someone who is close with my stepmom and my step-sisters. My family structure is similar to yours: my stepmom has two daughters and I have one full biological sister. All four of us are in our thirties now. \n\nFirst of all, L and J were 11 and 9 when you came into their lives. If you'd asked me at that age \u2014 and I was indeed 11 when my dad started dating my stepmom \u2014 I also would have said I didn't want another parental figure in my life. I wouldn't have even known what that meant, really. As if divorce isn't hard enough on children, now you're going to ask them to weigh the pros and cons of having another parental figure in their lives? No kid that age is mentally or emotionally equipped to make that kind of decision. It's up to the parents to decide how they want to handle parenting and step-parenting boundaries, hopefully with the goal of doing what's best for the children, respecting the other parent, and ending up with a healthy and loving blended family. \n\nWhat my dad and stepmom did (again, BEHIND the scenes\u2014I only learned about how consciously they went about this later) is similar in that they presented a united front when it came to household rules and such, but only the actual parent acted as a parental figure to their respective children, while the step-parent played a much more passive role. So my stepmom didn't make decisions about my life, put any pressure on us, or give us unsought advice. And if my biological sister or I broke a rule, my dad was the one who would talk to us about it and give the consequences, and vice versa when her kids broke a rule. It was kind of like having an aunt that's always around, as you put it. BUT: When it came to the step-family's traditions, there was an \"always welcome but no pressure\" policy: we could choose whether or not we wanted to participate. And every child in the house was treated equally: we all had the same rules and got the same gifts (not including gifts from the parent in the other home). Sometimes I participated in those traditions, and sometimes I didn't. Either way, I always felt included, wanted, and treated with fairness and love. We also made PLENTY of new traditions together as a blended family (IE, spending New Years Eve together making hot chocolate and watching the ball drop on TV). \n\nWhen L+J were growing up, it was on YOU, as the step-mom, to navigate being loving and inclusive without overstepping your boundaries. Especially with the age gap between your kids and them, L and J might have felt like second-best in your home\u2014like the \"leftover\" kids that were butting in on your biological family unit. I have several friends whose fathers and step-mothers went on to have more children who felt exactly that way: like the unwanted step-children intruding on dad's \"new family\". It's something you have to be really conscious of as a step-parent.  \n\nI can't help but read your post and wonder if L and J felt included, wanted, and treated equally by you and your husband *when they were children growing up*. Reading between the lines, it kind of sounds like you didn't *want* to be more than an \"aunt\" to them, and that you probably didn't do much to make them feel wanted and included by you\u2014until they showed you how upset they were as adults. I also wouldn't want a \"forced gift\" under those circumstances. I would want you to have included me in the first place, genuinely and out of love. \n\nEspecially given that they're *that* upset about not being included in your family traditions: that's a sign that it's probably not a \"new\" feeling. It's probably an old feeling from their childhood that got triggered by these situations. That would explain why they're acting like children as well: it's the unwanted step-child inside them that feels this pain, not their adult selves. \n\nAgain, if they had a wary or conflicted attitude toward you as kids, that's understandable! They had gone through a divorce, which is a serious trauma even under the best of circumstances. It's even understandable that they wouldn't want you in their wedding parties: even if you are extremely close with their mother, they might want to include just their mother and father in their wedding parties out of anxiety or respect or who knows what else. I just got married myself and I can promise you that I was much more concerned with not wanting to hurt my biological mom's feelings than I was with taking care of my stepmom's feelings. Planning a wedding with both families present made me just as anxious as I was as a kid, even though the divorce was over twenty years ago. It brought up all those old feelings for me. And no matter what, I knew my stepmom would understand\u2014*and still include me in her traditions*. **That's what being a good step-parent is: it's accepting that there's sometimes a one-way street in the relationship, because your stepchildren were the victims of divorce. You still have to do your best to include them.** Maybe my stepmom *has* given my stepsisters certain special presents or carried out certain traditions with them that she can't include me in\u2014but if she has, she's done that *in private*, so as not to hurt my feelings. Given how differently you treat your own biological kids *in front of them*, I completely understand where L and J are coming from. \n\nTLDR: You don't sound like you've been a very inclusive or thoughtful stepmom, and I think you might have especially been TA in the past, since L+J are acting like hurt children now, which is a sign that this is an old wound for them. I would take an honest look at how you treated L+J as their step-mom *when they were children* and see if that explains some of their behavior now.", "NTA and mostly they are not ypur kids.

I\u2019m sorry, by the way, about you making journals for them just to have them basically turn up their noses at them after they caused a huge fuss over the journals I know that had to be a little heartbreaking not to mention all the time and money you put into them\n\nEdited for spelling, silly autocorrect", "YTA for using all letters instead of names. It's too hard to follow stories you don't really care about in the first place.", "NTA they\u2019ve done nothing to include you in a way that these gifts would be given? Why try so dang hard. They\u2019re just jealous", "No win situation. If you had given them these gifts instead of what was on their registry, they would have been angry you overstepped or didn't listen. NTA.", "NTA but you are too. Going off was too much. All you had to do was tell them to return the gifts to you and if they ever change their minds they know where to find you. \nYou can decide if you want to do the books or just store them as is. Just thinking it t be nice if some years later you show the grandkids that they do have books from grandma OP.", "You were never gonna win this one. It\u2019s their problem to sort out first. It sounds like a huge ego thing. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be special to me, but now that I feel a special connection with you I\u2019m going to be a jerk and pretend you should be a mind reader and figure it out already\u201d\nThis is toxic. They\u2019re mature adult women who needs to fix their shit themselves.\nNTA.", "NTA. Sounds like they wanted OP to treat her own daughter like an aunt as well.", "oh OP youre NTA. your stepdaughters are. theyve made clear what their relationship with you will be, they cant flip flop that just because they got jealous of the family traditions you have with your daughter..", "NTA \n\nIt's normal you feel bad about it. Everyone with a heart would and you definitely have one. You just couldn't win with them, which is awful. Maybe, if you're up to it, you could keep up the journals and gift them to the kids on a special milestone in the future?\n\nI'm a step child myself and my relationship with my step dad was rocky (mildly put). But I do try to let him built his own relationship with my two boys.", "NTA This is why stepparenting is so damn hard. The rules are ridiculous. \nYou can't love a child more than their parents but you're not supposed to love your biochild differently than your stepkids. And, only the bioparents and stepkids get to decide when your overstepping or being hurtful.\n\nI think you did exactly what was asked of you . They just want to impose the ridiculous stepparent rules.", "\u201cD insisted to know what\u2019s wrong, and they said they didn\u2019t want forced gifts.\u201d\n\nI love that even their own mother was just as confused as you are. This gives me the feeling that she is in your side. I\u2019m happy for you both.\n\nNTA by the way. The stepdaughters are trying to get the best of both worlds without even lifting a finger to understand the tradition behind your gifts.", "Definitely NTA", "Nta. They gave you boundaries and you stuck to them.", "NTA. Trouble is, when you move the goalposts, sometimes you score an own goal. They're jealous, pure and simple.", "NTA They want to pick & choose when to be your \"daughters\", but it doesn't work that way. You're not a mind reader to know what specifically would be considered appropriate & acceptable to them & what wouldn't be.", ">couldn't even read it so YTA\n\nThen your judgement is invalid if you not judging op off of the story", ">But sometimes it can hurt being left out of things and I often wonder if I should push harder to try to be included more.\n\nYou should ask her for clarification on how hands on she would like you to be in her life now that her dad has passed. Maybe she's waiting for you to initiate. It's possible she's feeling awkward about it", "I think it's that as long as *they're* the ones rejecting *her*, it's fine. But when she's doing family stuff that doesn't include them, suddenly they're sour grapes.", "I understand that the girls were young when they initially made the decision that you were relegated to the role of \u201caunt\u201d but\u2026 when they were adult women and you were married to their father for many years, you were treated as a guest at their weddings, it was clear that you were not family. You were amazing and truly respected their requests. \u201cDamned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t.\u201d", "What kind of relationship do *you* want with them now?  That's the question to ask yourself before doing anything else.  It sounds like you've gotten as close to them as they allow, which makes sense when they're kids.  They're adults now and you get to make space if you need or want it.  \n\nDid you want to include them in your family traditions but didn't because you felt it was over-stepping?  Do you feel like they are your family?  Do you feel like you're their family?  What do you want your relationship with them to look like going forward?  Think about what you would do in these relationships without putting titles to it. \n\nYou don't have to be another mom to them but it definitely sounds like they consider you more than just their fathers wife.  Maybe there just isn't a good word in this language for what you mean to each other.  Figure out what you'd like from your relationship with them and then have a diversion with them again, if you want.  You can be family without having the title of mom.  There's a lot of room between mom and dad's wife, too.", "They were already grown when she married their dad.", "Right! This post annoys me because it\u2019s a perfect example of a stepmom respecting boundaries and giving step kids the relationship *they* want, and she *still* gets shit on. Argh. \n\nComing from someone with a stepmom who did *not* respect boundaries. And also someone who is a stepmom too and try my best to be the \u201caunt\u201d my stepson wants. Makes me terrified that 10 years from now my stepson will still say I did it wrong anyway lol", "No they weren\u2019t. They were 11 and 9.", "Get off the phone, you're too invested in this. So invested that it's almost infested with your opinion everywhere.  You'll end up with arthritis and sore butt with those heavy projections weighting your mind and itching your fingertips to type.", "Did you stretch before making that reach?", "Sorry, I read it at 6 years ago, I missed the 2. I've just woken up.", "All good, it makes it feel almost heart breaking for the OP though.", "probably perhaps because the  Mom of OPs stepkids is heavily involved with her daughters that the daughters felt doing that with OP might somewhat be hurtful to the mom? im reaching here. \n\nbut even OP said she and the mom are great friends. so i dont know with these girls.", "OP allowed them full control to decide their relationship. They have a mother they have a good relationship with. They are in no need of a second mother. They wanted dad's wife to stay dad's wife and nothing more. Even when it was revisited, their answer was the same.\n\nIt isn't that hard. I wish my own step parents had stayed in their lane."]}
