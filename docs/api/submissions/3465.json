I said that they were the ones who didn't want to be part of my family traditions, I was just trying to be respectful, and when they wanted to, I did my best to include them.

Then after they guilt you, when you try to make it right, they don't want them? \n\nOnce you've cooled down, I think you need to have a serious talk to clear the air and move forward.

Absolutely, but only to point where the kids have set boundaries - which they did and you respected. And you do not need to keep doing that at all once they are adults.", "NTA.

That\u2019s their responsibility. \n\nWhile I think the sentiment that you\u2019re \u201cnever going to include them again\u201d was a bit hyperbolic, it\u2019s not unreasonable to need to set a firmer boundary with them. I don\u2019t necessarily think you need to verbally walk that back right now, though. Instead, it would be better to get some time and distance from them and think about how, assuming they use this as a wake up call to change, you want to move forward.", "NTA - you respected your stepkid's wishes, if they changed their minds then it's their job to communicate it with you.

And I wanted a closer one, D wanted us to have a closer one, my husband and my kids did too, but they didn't. And I respected that.", "I had to cut off some things due to word count limit, but they had an idea of what they were missing, they knew about the journal (they saw mine multiple times and knew I had ones for my kids). Also I asked them of they wanted me to be more involved when they were older (20s) and they didn't, that's why they asked me to be just a guest during their weddings, and why I wasn't asked to help organise/host their showers, nor was I involved in their pregnancies.", ">We had another discussion again, when they were 22 and 20, and they wanted the relationship to stay the same.\n\nIt was revisited when the girls were adults. They reiterated maintaining the status quo. These two are the AHs for deciding to flip the script when they see the \"benefits\" of OP behaving as a parent to them, as opposed to an aunt.

Naw. They don't get the free pass. They made their choice and had years of relationship to consider in making it.

They just assumed it would be you duplicating what they already had with their mom.\n\nIt sounds like they're just salty that they noped out of something cool without realizing it.

My advice- approach them now not with apology, but a going back to the drawing board request, what is their exact expectation of your relationship with them, and with their kids now? Is it the same as before? Do they detect a change of heart on their end? Why? How do they wanna express it to you now?

Go touch some grass.", "Just offering another perspective here, as someone who is close with my stepmom and my step-sisters. My family structure is similar to yours: my stepmom has two daughters and I have one full biological sister. All four of us are in our thirties now. \n\nFirst of all, L and J were 11 and 9 when you came into their lives. If you'd asked me at that age \u2014 and I was indeed 11 when my dad started dating my stepmom \u2014 I also would have said I didn't want another parental figure in my life. I wouldn't have even known what that meant, really. As if divorce isn't hard enough on children, now you're going to ask them to weigh the pros and cons of having another parental figure in their lives? No kid that age is mentally or emotionally equipped to make that kind of decision. It's up to the parents to decide how they want to handle parenting and step-parenting boundaries, hopefully with the goal of doing what's best for the children, respecting the other parent, and ending up with a healthy and loving blended family. \n\nWhat my dad and stepmom did (again, BEHIND the scenes\u2014I only learned about how consciously they went about this later) is similar in that they presented a united front when it came to household rules and such, but only the actual parent acted as a parental figure to their respective children, while the step-parent played a much more passive role. So my stepmom didn't make decisions about my life, put any pressure on us, or give us unsought advice. And if my biological sister or I broke a rule, my dad was the one who would talk to us about it and give the consequences, and vice versa when her kids broke a rule. It was kind of like having an aunt that's always around, as you put it. BUT: When it came to the step-family's traditions, there was an \"always welcome but no pressure\" policy: we could choose whether or not we wanted to participate. And every child in the house was treated equally: we all had the same rules and got the same gifts (not including gifts from the parent in the other home). Sometimes I participated in those traditions, and sometimes I didn't. Either way, I always felt included, wanted, and treated with fairness and love. We also made PLENTY of new traditions together as a blended family (IE, spending New Years Eve together making hot chocolate and watching the ball drop on TV). \n\nWhen L+J were growing up, it was on YOU, as the step-mom, to navigate being loving and inclusive without overstepping your boundaries. Especially with the age gap between your kids and them, L and J might have felt like second-best in your home\u2014like the \"leftover\" kids that were butting in on your biological family unit. I have several friends whose fathers and step-mothers went on to have more children who felt exactly that way: like the unwanted step-children intruding on dad's \"new family\". It's something you have to be really conscious of as a step-parent.  \n\nI can't help but read your post and wonder if L and J felt included, wanted, and treated equally by you and your husband *when they were children growing up*. Reading between the lines, it kind of sounds like you didn't *want* to be more than an \"aunt\" to them, and that you probably didn't do much to make them feel wanted and included by you\u2014until they showed you how upset they were as adults. I also wouldn't want a \"forced gift\" under those circumstances. I would want you to have included me in the first place, genuinely and out of love. \n\nEspecially given that they're *that* upset about not being included in your family traditions: that's a sign that it's probably not a \"new\" feeling. It's probably an old feeling from their childhood that got triggered by these situations. That would explain why they're acting like children as well: it's the unwanted step-child inside them that feels this pain, not their adult selves. \n\nAgain, if they had a wary or conflicted attitude toward you as kids, that's understandable! They had gone through a divorce, which is a serious trauma even under the best of circumstances. It's even understandable that they wouldn't want you in their wedding parties: even if you are extremely close with their mother, they might want to include just their mother and father in their wedding parties out of anxiety or respect or who knows what else. I just got married myself and I can promise you that I was much more concerned with not wanting to hurt my biological mom's feelings than I was with taking care of my stepmom's feelings. Planning a wedding with both families present made me just as anxious as I was as a kid, even though the divorce was over twenty years ago. It brought up all those old feelings for me. And no matter what, I knew my stepmom would understand\u2014*and still include me in her traditions*. **That's what being a good step-parent is: it's accepting that there's sometimes a one-way street in the relationship, because your stepchildren were the victims of divorce. You still have to do your best to include them.** Maybe my stepmom *has* given my stepsisters certain special presents or carried out certain traditions with them that she can't include me in\u2014but if she has, she's done that *in private*, so as not to hurt my feelings. Given how differently you treat your own biological kids *in front of them*, I completely understand where L and J are coming from. \n\nTLDR: You don't sound like you've been a very inclusive or thoughtful stepmom, and I think you might have especially been TA in the past, since L+J are acting like hurt children now, which is a sign that this is an old wound for them. I would take an honest look at how you treated L+J as their step-mom *when they were children* and see if that explains some of their behavior now.", "NTA and mostly they are not ypur kids.
