I was ok with that.\n\nThe same thing happened when they had kids, except the kids call me Grandma OP. BTW, this is not coming from D, her and I are great friends, as close as sisters.\n\nSo E found out she was pregant a year ago, she was already engaged by then. I organized her baby/bridal shower, and my gift to her was: a handmade baby outfit, a framed cross stitched baby room sign with his initials, a handmade veil and a hand stitched handkerchief with her future initials.\n\nA few days later, during a family dinner, L said that she felt kind of left out that E got handmade gifts, while all I got her was something off her register. I replied that what E got were *traditional* gifts from my side of the family, and that I didn't want to burden her and J with them.\n\nFast foreward to my daughter's wedding day, and while doing my whole \"mother of the bride\" speech, I brought out another gift/tradition: it's a leather bound journal, with her initials embossed in gold leaf. It was started by my mother when I found out I was pregnant, with letters to my daughter every month, then I took over the day she was born by writing letters every birthday and milestone. Now it was up to her husband to keep ot safe and fill it.\n\nL and J again said that they felt I was giving her very thoughtful gifts, while I bought *whatever* from their registries. And that I was treating my soon-to-be biological grandson better than their kids, even though their kids love me the same way they love D. I again said that this was a family tradition, and that I did not want to overstep.\n\nThen this Thanksgiving, I thought since they were so bothered, I made the same journals for the rest of my grandkids. They cost a pretty penny, and it took me literal weeks to finish.\n\nI thought L and J would be happy with them, but when I gave them to them they gave lukewarm thanks. D insisted to know what's wrong, and they said that they didn't want *forced* gifts.\n\nI was so upset that, once I made sure the kids couldn't hear, I just went off on them. I said that they were the ones who didn't want to be part of my family traditions, I was just trying to be respectful, and when they wanted to, I did my best to include them. Then I made them give me back the journals and said that I was never going to include them again, because I am tired of them jerking me around.\n\nNow that I cooled off I feel like a total AH.", "created_utc": 1669665598, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z76o2f/aita_for_not_including_my_stepdaughters_in_my/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would speak to your husband and let him know that you have done nothing but followed through with this, and if they want or expect more, they should make it clear to you. It doesn't sound like you were unwilling.", "NTA they decided that they didn't see you as a mother figure but as an aunt 26 years ago they made their bed so they get to lie in it", "NTA. If they were no longer wanting you to play the aunt role in their lives, they should have had a conversation with you about it. \n\nI want to thank you for all of the hard work you did on their journals! I encourage you to keep them and update them as the years go by to gift directly to your grandkids someday \ud83d\ude42", "NTA. They were jerking you around. They can't have it both ways and it looks like D understands what they were doing was wrong. If you want to have a relationship with them in future you can explain that you may have over reacted, but that's only if you want a relationship with them.", "NTA. They're push and pulling you. They want you to be more like an aunt until it's time for gifts that are more suited from mother to child. Then after they guilt you, when you try to make it right, they don't want them? \n\nOnce you've cooled down, I think you need to have a serious talk to clear the air and move forward. They clearly feel sad for being left out of special traditions that you didn't let them know about beforehand but you didn't do it with malice, just trying to respect their mother and your role in their lives. That doesn't give them the right to turn up their noses when you go out of your way to make them feel included.", "NTA. They can't keep you at arms length and then be upset when you do the same. They can't tell you that you are being unfair, and then be upset when you try to correct that for them. You didn't buy *whatever* from their registries, you gifted them something that, presumably, they wanted. You literally can't win with these two. Going off on them was justified, taking the journals back maybe wasn't the best because it punishes the innocent grandkids, but I'm not going to call you T A for that.", "NTA\n\nYou were and are only an aunt.\n\nIf they want to show of with the kind of handmade presents, they shouldn't \"force\" you!!! to use the registry for a present.\nBoth are to old and you to \"play\"around", "NTA \n\nThey have both parents living and in the picture. They didn't want you to act or try to be a maternal figure which you respected. Thus you applied family traditions to your bio daughters only, as per their wishes. \nThey can't have it both ways now that they saw those traditions involved some pretty lovely and costly gifts.", "NTA. They definitely want to have their cake and eat it, too. They chose to have a mother-daughter relationship with D, and explicitly not with you. That\u2019s fine, but they can\u2019t then say that they just want to participate in anything that would benefit them at your cost without ever reciprocating.", "NTA. They sound like a pain in the arse.", "NTA \n\nThey don\u2019t get to cherry pick the bits they want off you.

Absolutely, but only to point where the kids have set boundaries - which they did and you respected. And you do not need to keep doing that at all once they are adults.", "NTA. Sounds like though you had a discussion originally, the relationship and expectations seem to have changed from the stepdaughters. You should sit down with both of them and discuss", "NTA - I can understand why you lost your temper, and if you wanted to apologize for doing that, it would be understandable - but with the caveat that your stepdaughters need to understand they can't have it both ways. \n\nThey don't get to have all the perks of having you as a mother figure and sharing your mother/daughter traditions with them while treating you as a family friend. You have a different bond with your daughter. I'm sure they don't treat you on the same level as they do their own mother.", "NTA. They clearly have unresolved issues around your place in their lives that they need to sort out. That\u2019s their responsibility. \n\nWhile I think the sentiment that you\u2019re \u201cnever going to include them again\u201d was a bit hyperbolic, it\u2019s not unreasonable to need to set a firmer boundary with them. I don\u2019t necessarily think you need to verbally walk that back right now, though. Instead, it would be better to get some time and distance from them and think about how, assuming they use this as a wake up call to change, you want to move forward.", "NTA - you respected your stepkid's wishes, if they changed their minds then it's their job to communicate it with you. And of course you don't have to do it.", "NTA\n\nThey have their own mother and her family traditions. \n\nHonestly, I feel D should have stepped in and did the scolding, because I'm sure she raised them to have better manners.", "NTA\n\nJust cut off radically any future time they bring this BS again", "Nope, NTA. You were right, they *are* jerking you around.", "NTA. sounds like you were a great step-parent/aunt and respected boundaries every step of the way.", "NTA for not including them, but you maybe be the AH for taking the gifts back. It could have been just a kind gesture that is reflective of you and your character, and even if they were unappreciative, you still went out of your way to include them, making you the bigger person, but taking them back does make you asshole-ish. \n\nBut it was kind of you to include them even after having them establish a relationship that does not require you to make that gesture.", "If I understand you correctly, you took back gifts from your grandkids because their moms were AH. If that\u2019s the case then you are an AH for that. Telling your stepdaughters off might have been the right thing to do but taking back the children\u2019s gifts weren\u2019t. Even if you gave their moms the gifts to fill out for them with the intent that they would be passed down I think was overkill. If you don\u2019t want to give them back to the moms is it possible to give them directly to the kids to use as their own journals?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Well, it doesn't work that way.  You were VERY respectful of them (i.e., not wanting to overstep).  They couldn't leave well enough alone and they just pouted about not being included, and when you do include them, you get treated like crap.  Yeah, no, doesn't work for me.", "NTA.

I think what they're really upset about is that your kids got something cool that they didn't. They wouldn't have wanted a special thing if you had just bought your own children something off the registry. However -- if D had done something special like this for your kids as well as her own, owing to the blended-family situation, you can bet that L and J would have been territorial over it, and accused E and F of honing in on their turf.\n\nKeep on with your Aunt role. Edit: typos", "It honestly sounds like they are jealous of the love and attention your daughter is receiving for having a baby and getting married.  They don't see things as fair because they want you to treat your daughter the same way you treat them, but the thing is, it was all their choice.  Did they just expect you to treat your daughter the same way that they wanted to be treated.\n\n\nThey are already accusing you of treating your grandchild differently, when they were the ones who wanted the same boundaries for their kids as they had for themselves.  \n\nThey are hurt over a tradition your own mom started for you, and are mad that they were not part of the same tradition when they never wanted you to be a mother to them.\n\n\nSo now they think things are unfair for their kids and for themselves because your daughter having a kid and getting married showed them that they missed out on having a caring bonus mom.\n\n\nI would straight up tell them that you have done nothing but respect their boundaries and feelings in regards to being their dads wife.  That your relationship with your own daughter is much different than your relationship with them.  That they can't expect you to go out of your way to include them in the motherly traditions of your family when they have repeatedly treated you as nothing but their fathers wife.", "NTA. They made the choice as adults the relationship they wanted with you and that\u2019s what they got. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong. If they want more then the ball is in their court.", "INFO The fact you call it \"burdening\" them with family traditions makes me wonder if there is more than what you are saying. It sounds like you don't have that great a relationship with your stepdaughters, and I would interpret \"like an aunt\" as being part of the family. You are describing a huge discrepancy in gifts-- and then high expectations for what you did make them. That they hesitate to accept them when they might already have complicated feelings isn't necessarily a bad response depending on your history and what your actual relationship is like.-- is there a rougher relationship than you share?", "Edit- Your step-daughters suck. NTA\n\nThey knew what they were missing from having seen it growing up, but only wanted to get in on it when they were left out as adults when the bio daughter was gifted. They want the goods without having to put in the work of a relationship.", "I know that they were too young then to make a definitive decision, that was why I revisited it when L got married, and they *both* reasserted that I was not their parent, just their father's wife. That's why I consider their decision made 15 years ago.", "Thank you, that is what I'm planning to do. I will be giving them to my grandkids when they get married/find a life partner (or when I am too old to continue them if they want to stay single)", "I am planning on continuing the journals for my grandkids and giving it to them when the time comes.", "We had another discussion again, when they were 22 and 20, and they wanted the relationship to stay the same.", "She did, I had to cut out a lot of my original post due to word count limit. But she barely started when I just couldn't hold back anymore.", "I might have taken then back, but I will be filling them myself. They way I see it, I will be giving it to the grandkids myself, and L and J are free to start their own journals. I just want no part in them jerking me around again.", "I had to cut off a lot of my original post (it was almost 5k words), but here are some answers that might seem relevant to you:\n\nFirst the wedding gifts: I got L a set of copper pots and pans (one of the pricier gifts) and for J I paid for a week in a resort for her honeymoon (they couldn't afford one, D paid the plane tickets).\n\nBridal shower gifts: I got them the same thing, bridal robes with their names embroidered on the back.\n\nBaby shower gifts: I have 5 grandkids, so it's easier to say that I bought gifts costing at least $200 for each kid.\n\nI said burdening them, because including someone in an unwanted tradition is an emotional burden, by doing that you are burdening them with the expectation of fostering a closer relationship than what they might want.\n\nAnd I have a good relationship with them, not as close as what I have with my kids or what they have with their mom, but a good one. And I wanted a closer one, D wanted us to have a closer one, my husband and my kids did too, but they didn't. And I respected that.", "I had to cut off some things due to word count limit, but they had an idea of what they were missing, they knew about the journal (they saw mine multiple times and knew I had ones for my kids). Also I asked them of they wanted me to be more involved when they were older (20s) and they didn't, that's why they asked me to be just a guest during their weddings, and why I wasn't asked to help organise/host their showers, nor was I involved in their pregnancies.", ">We had another discussion again, when they were 22 and 20, and they wanted the relationship to stay the same.\n\nIt was revisited when the girls were adults. They reiterated maintaining the status quo. These two are the AHs for deciding to flip the script when they see the \"benefits\" of OP behaving as a parent to them, as opposed to an aunt. Nope, that's not how it works, and they don't get extra kindness after this behavior. They shat their beds and now get to lay in them.", "As young kids, I can go for them not understanding what they might be passing up, and their mom having personal reasons for wanting the relationship to be the way it ended up, when she would have been the real decision maker.\n\nAs adults. Naw. They don't get the free pass. They made their choice and had years of relationship to consider in making it. I'd not be surprised if they didn't even bother to ask what your offer would mean. ie. They just assumed it would be you duplicating what they already had with their mom.\n\nIt sounds like they're just salty that they noped out of something cool without realizing it. It also sounds like their own mom hasn't done anything like this for them either, and they may also be realizing that too. With some displacement onto you over it.\n\nThey had their choice. Monty Hall offered them doors number 1, 2 and 3. They chose door number 1 twice. They can't complain years later when they found out that what was behind door number 2 wasn't the donkey.\n\nOh, that Monty Hall, he was always a crafty one.

Just so you know, if I were in step kids situation I'd be grateful to have someone like you in my life who has clearly tried very hard to respect her step kids wishes. I hope they see that someday soon!", "That's good to hear!  I'm glad you've got people defending you against their gift grab!", "Hoooly shit. That changes things a smidgen.", "Yep. Just deleted everything from before my edit to make my stance less confusing.", "My husband is also upset, but he tends to prefer to de-escalate in the moment, then scold and try to resolve later."]}
