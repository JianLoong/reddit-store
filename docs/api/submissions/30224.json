In what world is this an issue? \n\nFor children to flourish they need parents who are also looking after themselves, mentally and physically. Trust me, a short holiday away from your children is not a crime and won\u2019t be doing anyone any harm.", "NTA. And your MIL should mind her own business. \n\nBut just for you, do you feel ready to leave your children for 5 days for the first time? Does your mother know how to handle the baby for more than one night? If not, would be there time to do a trial run?", "NTA Your ML stepped over the line. If she's blowing up your phone, you need to ask your husband to rein her in. Your husband and you have decided it is safe to leave your children under the care of your mother. I smell a little jealousy there.", "NTA, put some boundaries in place with your ML. She\u2019s out of line speaking to you that way. She can voice concern without being disrespectful. Also enjoy your trip and Happy Anniversary.", "NTA. Happy Anniversary and Bon Voyage!", "NTA. You\u2019re leaving your children with someone you trust. They will be well taken care of, MIL needs to mind her business. You absolutely deserve to enjoy your trip.", "NTA. I expect you're going to suffer from the separation more than your baby will. \n\nI was going to say, \"just make sure your mother has really thought it through what it will be like to care for an infant as well as a 3- and 7-year-old,\" but since you mention in a comment that your sister will also be there, that's not an issue. \n\nYour MIL is an asshole for 1. not minding her own business and 2. blowing up *your* phone instead of her son's.", "NTA- everybody is entitled to a few days off from being parents once in a while. It\u2019s only 5 days and you are leaving baby to be spoiled by a responsible adult. Enjoy your holiday.", "NTA\n\nIgnore her. She's jealous you didn't ask her, so now she is trying to interfere with your anniversary.", "NTA  the children will be taken care of, loved, and safe. Thus it is no longer any of MIL's business. Go enjoy your cruise and bring back a good present to thank your mother.", "NTA. Ignore your MIL. Stop responding to her texts, and stop answering her calls. You need to put some distance between you and start setting boundaries. It sounds like your mother has a good support system in place, in addition to her own experience raising you. She'll be fine. This is none of your MIL's business. \n\nThis is for your husband to manage, not you, since this is his mother. He needs to shut this shit down and set a boundary. \n\nHead over to /r/justnomil if you need further support with a pushy MIL.", "NTA - you need to say something to her along the lines if you keep intruding you\u2019ll find your access to our family curtailed.

Pursed lips, increased phone calls, not asking about holiday plans, the whole 9 yards....\n\n\nMy mother on the other hand basically kicked me out - lovingly - kidnapped our 6mo old, gathered all her friends (who I've known my whole life) and planned such a fun week for the little one I kinda wish we had stayed home with them! \n\nGo!

Also good for you for recognizing that.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother has agreed to watch over your kids, so they are taken care of.

Any more comments will result in a cooling off period of two months.  Which will take her to January, and will involve her in missing Christmas with your family.

Have a wonderful vacation!", "We can't live our lives for our children only, no matter how much we love them. Our partners need attention,  we need to have contact, and we need to connect as adults.

This is why my fiance doesn't really talk to his sisters. They're nosy busy bodies. They can't stand me for no good reason other than when my fiance and I started dating, he stopped jumping whenever they said jump. You have every right to enjoy time without your kids and it's none of your MIL's business. If your husband doesn't put his foot down with his mother, I'd consider leaving him at home, too. LOL.", "NTA - next time she rings, tell her since she\u2019s so concerned, she\u2019s just volunteered herself to take care of all 3 kids when you go away in 2 months time, lie through your teeth \ud83d\ude02 say you\u2019ll be going for a month, to a remote overseas location. Don\u2019t let her get a word in. Start talking the children\u2019s schedules & conflicting appointments, she\u2019ll just have to work it out.

Having children doesn't mean you have to give up on enjoying life, especially when you've planned it well and ensured that your children are in safe and loving company.

My fiance's mother once told her kids that sometimes you have to take time away from your kids to mentally reset.

They never let their kids out of their sight.", "I\u2019m a little sad to leave them, but I\u2019m honestly so excited to have time with just my husband. About 3 months ago, they started spending the day with her every other weekend, and about a month and half ago, my oldest 2 started spending the night every other Saturday.

CHAT GPT is doing well today.", "Well, then it looks like MIL is playing the fuck around and fight out game. Literally ignore her. Tell her one more time \"You keep bringing this up and I'm just going to block your number. You can talk to me through your son.\" Then follow through on that and if she keeps going at it, then she can cry in her cereal over her precious son not talking to her.

More than many others would have done. I think it is going to go Great!\n\n\nDon't let MIL beat your exitment down.  With 3 kids you need to focus on yourelfs and have some romance and rest.\n\n\nMaby your MIL is jelaous because youre family gets to have the kids and not her? If that's what it is you can at least talk abort it and make a plan for her to maby have The kids litte more.  Win win!\n\n\nGood luck and have a nice trip!!", "This sounds awesome. Would have suggersted if you don't know how you feel about this to do a trial run. But it sounds like you are already doing it. So it will all be well and don't let your MIL change your oppinum on that.", "I say good for you! As parents you need to create time for the both of you and I think it\u2019s great. \n\nGo in your cruise, have a great time. Bond and strengthen your relationship and come back rested and relaxed so you can continue to be great parents.", "Maybe you should look on this in terms of \"gotta do it before the baby gets old enough to actually miss us\".\nEither way, only you guys can make this decision.

Ones not even born yet and we\u2019ve already booked a holiday for the New Year! It\u2019s so lovely to have family who you love and trust enough to enjoy a few breaks throughout the year! And of course the kids love the family breaks too, but you need to prioritise your relationship sometimes.", "Doubt it. I don't think op is an ah, but it is really weird to leave your newborn for several days. If there was an emergency, what would she do from a cruise ship? I'd just wait a bit before going.\n\n*newly born baby, not technically a newborn.", "A six month old is not a newborn.", "Still weird.", "No not weird, esp with two already in the world.  6 months, kids are crawling, sitting, able to feed themselves small stuff.  Mom and Dad need time away, so they can reconnect and come back and be better parents. At 6 weeks old, I would agree.  But 6 months, naww.\n\nNTA, go enjoy your week OP.  OH and block the MIL number.  Don't even say anything to her, just block her.  Let your husband know that he is handling all communication with his mother from now on."]}
