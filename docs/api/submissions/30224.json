It is not your problem.  \n\nDon\u2019t let MIL try to run your life.  She\u2019s a miserable b and misery loves company.", "NTA\n\nIt is 5 days! All 3 children will be fine.  You MIL seems to be the only one who has a problem with it.  Your husband has your back.  Go on your trip! Celebrate your anniversary! Enjoy some alone time with each other!  Let your MIL burn bridges!\n\nCongratulations on your anniversary!!!", "NTA. Go on your cruise", "NTA\n\nYou need some time for the two of you and to relax. Enjoy the cruise!!", "NTA. It\u2019s a 4 night/5 day cruise not a 3 week long tour of Europe. Your baby will be just fine. You deserve a break.", "NTA. My parents watched my very young kids while my husband and I went on an adults only vacation. If the kids are happy and well taken care of MIL can shut it. \n\nThat relationship time and self care time is important for people with or without kids. You enjoy it!", "NTA - your mother in law is jealous you get to spend 5 days alone with her son - w/out her.  Perhaps in all that alone time with your hubby, you two can come up with a strategy in which you both have and enforce healthy boundaries with his unhinged mother.", "NTA - enjoy that cruise with your husband, close all notifications and go create wonderful memories as a couple", "I don't know what your situation is with the cruise but a lot of times you can't even get refunds or have to pay large cancellation fees to even not go.Regardless I still think you are NTA,six months is fine to go for a few days.", "Agree. She is the AH!", "This! All of this! I'm pregnant and due in a couple months with my husband and Is first kiddo. Our first night away from baby will be when he's about 5 months old. My brother in law is getting married and the current plan is for my parents to take the little one home at around 7 or 8 to give us a night to party. I'm so fucking excited. We might do a practice run shortly before the wedding just to give my parents an easier trial run.\n\nHaving a short break from your kids isn't bad. It's healthy as hell for you and them. Mil needs to fucking chill.", "Yes! As a kid (I don't know when it started) I would be at my grandparents each summer. They live only like a km apart, but 5 hours away from me and my parents. I spent one week at one pair of grandparents house, the second week at the others. One of them have a pool, and one of my aunt's also lives nearby so I loved it! I believe when I was 7 I took the train by myself for the first time (my parents brought me to the train and notified the personnel, my grandparents picked me up after the journey, I didn't have to change trains) to get there. My parents and I also moved when I was just a year old, and they told me that my grandma would look after me for long times while my parents and my grandpa were renovating the house. It enriches children to let them spend time and experience things without only being with the parents constantly!", "I\u2018d hope and assume that a grandMOTHER is well capable of handling a baby for more than a night\u2026 even more so if she offered.", "Plus, she's been doing trial nights to get everyone used to it. I think it'll be fine.", "How is that relevant?", "I can't find a single comment that is not NTA. \n\nThe baby is obviously safe and in capable hands, but 5 days to be unreachable seems like a long time for an infant. It's not like if there is an emergency they can hop in the car, on a bus or even on a plane and head home.", "Honestly not really, I tried in the beginning to start a good relationship with her, but she never really seemed interested. Through the years, she\u2019s only ever been interested in my husband and kids, which is fine. So it\u2019s not necessarily a bad relationship, more just a lack of relationship.", "We got a notarized letter allowing them to take them to the hospital in case of an emergency. My children\u2019s doctor allows them to have \u201cauthorized representatives\u201d and all three of them have been on there since my children were born, so we are all good there! Thank you", "He was 23, he just turned 31", "So about 3 months ago, my kids started spending a few hours a day every other weekend with her, about 1.5 months ago my older 2 started staying the night every other Saturday, and this past month, my baby also stayed every other Saturday to ease them into this transition", "Yeah, after six months a break is well deserved! And if you have an issue you should probably address both the mother and father who are going to be enjoying a great cruise!", "What does that mean? Yeah, it\u2019s a baby, and what? babies aren\u2019t little breakable porcelain dolls! And they can form bonds of attachment with people other than parents! As long as baby is with someone who is a good caregiver and who the baby has a bond with, it\u2019s absolutely fine! Baby will NOT remember at all!", "It was actually my mom who suggested it in the first place. So definitely not \u201cdumping them on my mom\u201d, but we do yearly family vacations. This year we took them to Tennessee for a week. So I highly doubt there is a reason to \u201cfeel bad for my kids\u201d. But I appreciate your feedback regardless.", "I went on a 4 day trip with my husband when my daughter was 6 months old. \n\nShe\u2019s fine. Nice kid, does well in school, doesn\u2019t remember I left her with her grandparents 11 years ago. \n\nNTA.", "I'd also ensure that your mom knows how she's acting. She may try something, so ensure your mom watches out for that.", "Why is it a problem that *you* are not staying at home with the baby, but not that your husband isn\u2019t staying at home with the baby?        \n          \nTell her the baby has two parents, one of them is her offspring, and if it\u2019s bothering her so much that your baby will be away from their parents for a week than she should hassle her son to stay.     \n       \nFuck this sexist bullshit.", "Block her. You have no reason to take this abuse from her, if she has something to say she can say it to her son or not at all.", "I'm sorry you have a terrible MIL.  Enjoy your cruise.  nta", "And yet here you are", "I think the situation depends on whether your baby would cry nonstop if you aren't there. Are they used to grandma taking care of them for days? \n\nMy cousin went on his honeymoon when his son was 4 months old and his son cried inconsolably for most of the week.", "you guys should totally at least go low contact like YESTERDAY.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA:  I mean, he goes LC - you can just set a spam filter for her number \ud83e\udd2b\ud83e\udd10", "Maybe she wants to go on your honeymoon for you.", "What does she have to do with this anyhow? NTA", "Then it\u2019s hubby\u2019s job to to tell her y\u2019all won\u2019t around till after new years cuz she isn\u2019t listening to what the two of you want", "Is she jealous that she doesn't get to watch the kids?", "NTA. I went to Greece for 10 days when my youngest was just around a year. It\u2019s ok to take time with your spouse. If you don\u2019t that relationship will wither. \n\nGlad he\u2019s standing up for you and him. She needs to be checked.", "That is exactly how you plan for away time. You have a village to take care of the children, including baby. And in the great scheme of life, baby is not going to remember one week's absence after you return. If anything, the older children might be a bit miffed, but that depends on how the visit with Gma goes. NTA Ignore all messages from MIL. ALL messages. Let hubs take the lead on this. She's his mother!", "You've handled this transition perfectly.  Go and ENJOY time with your husband.", "They\u2019ll be just fine. Everyone needs some one on one time with their spouse and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.", "NTA.   Have a great trip.  Tell MIL to mind her own business", "You sound like such a thoughtful and thorough mama!!! \ud83e\ude77", "Wonder if you have asked MIL to watch the baby instead if she would have had the same reaction.", "So now we know why you had baby number 3....", "It sounds perfect! Everyone will have an amazing time apart and you'll be so happy to come back home! Wish you a great trip with your husband! (And ignore your mil...)", "This is great plan! Easing them all into a longer visit and getting to know their routines. And having a sister and BF to pitch hit is fantastic. You my dear just scored a trifecta! May the travel gods follow your every move on your trip.", "Sounds like you've prepared everyone well! Make sure you have wifi on the cruise just in case and have a blast!\n\nIgnore the MIL and block her if she won't stop. She can speak to you through her son.", "I was going to say Y T A because this can be so traumatic for infants but you really are trying your best. Please keep trying. This gradual process is perfect. NTA", "True.", "Absolutely! Whenever I left my kids with my mom I was like \u201cEh, there\u2019s hospitals in an emergency. Byeeeee!\u201d", "Yeah, I think there is more going on here with her, and this is just something she jumped on. Personally, she may feel like leaving a 6m old is not a good idea, but it\u2019s your decision not hers. \n\nI would maybe talk to her with your husband. Present a united front. You can give her some ground and say that you know she\u2019s trying to help and provide guidance to you. (That would be putting a positive spin on it\ud83e\udd2a) And you value her input, but you and your husband have decided to take this trip.", "Then it should be fine.\nIf YOU or MOM are worried, maybe do two nights in a row to make sure nothing changes?!?\nBut I'd be okay with this, as a mom.", "Ok cool, start dropping babies on the floor cause they aren't breakable dolls, let me know how that goes for you.  \nBaby won't remember consciencely, sure. Pity there's more.", "Don't block the number, ever. Mute notifications. That way, you are not bothered by the person, but you still get every last thing they want to send. It helps if the police need to get involved, or a lawyer, if you need a restraining or no contact order, etc.", "She\u2019s just saving up the trauma. Sure she\u2019s fine now but give it a couple years and she\u2019s going to be selling used clothes by the side of the road to fuel her drug addiction because her mother did not spend 24/7/365 with her until she was 18. Sorry, that\u2019s just how it works. /s", "Methinks she\u2019s mostly pissed you didn\u2019t leave them with her", "Give your mum express instructions that MIL is NOT to take the children, and to not speak or open the door to her.", "Yep we should start throwing all those rocks at the MIL. I hope you have a wonderful holiday, and come back refreshed and full of energy.", "Well that\u2019s YOU! There is nothing wrong with being away from you baby, and it doesn\u2019t mean you love them any less! But parents need quality alone time as well, especially as this isn\u2019t their first child, it\u2019s their 3rd, alone time is hard to come by! Obviously they love their children but they need some couple time! happy mentally healthy parents will BENEFIT the children immensely and if a holiday helps, then that\u2019s great! \n\nThe baby will NOT remember that time at all!", "What? obviously I don\u2019t mean drop babies! What I mean is babies can withstand normal life changes and routine changes just fine! they don\u2019t die if they go to someone\u2019s house (someone they\u2019re comfortable with) for 5 days. Their subconscious will also not be affected if they are still treated lovingly and with care, as I assume their grandparents would treat them!", "Speaking of 18 years old. Kind of surprised this sub didn't pick up on the age gap here as this sub usually crucifies age gaps. \n\nOP 25 with a 7 year old, 18 years old when they had the baby, potentially 17 when conceived. \n\nHusband 31, so 24 when she was 18. Not horrible relative to what this sub sees, but not great, people have been ripped apart for smaller age gaps involving 1 partner in their teens.  \n\nAnyway, not passing judgement, just making an observation. \n\nAlso OPs other posts are concerning in terms of their relationship in general.", "That's one strong possibility!  The other possibility I have seen with some of my friends with their MILs - which is that they never got to do things like this when they were raising children and so they shame women who can do things like this as being Bad Mothers pretty much entirely out of jealousy.", "I'd say ding ding ding LOL", "Wondering that myself.", "Winner winner chicken dinner!", "She may have wanted to be asked, but I doubt that she would want to actually look after the kids for 5 days.", "Or mad that she never dared thinking about something like this herself in OPs Situation. Or is mad that she never had the support system to do so.", "That's not mum, its not the same. Loved or not. Yeah, subconscious building starts early. And it doesn't take much to form a pathway in the brain for a baby. Very easy to build quickly on a clean slate.  \nI'm sorry you don't understand babies.", "The MIL's behavior shouldn't be a surprise if there is a 7 and 3 year old involved. So, from 18 years old (or younger) to today, MIL's acting differently?", "Thanks, yeah. I didn't get so far as addressing the kids' ages but the whole thing is...interesting. She had 3 of this guy's kids by the age he was when he got her pregnant the first time.", "7 year old could be from another relationship (hers or his)", "This is accurate!! My MIL begs for my daughter to spend the night but when I was in the hospital for 2 weeks she watched her for a single night then said she had a life to live. They think they want the time until we give it to them.", "Lol my MIL would love watching my baby for 5 days. She did with my daughter (now 11) and she often BEGS to keep the new baby on trips but I just prefer now to take the baby with us. However, nothing wrong with not taking the baby. Baby will be safe with mom and mom will enjoy herself. MIL sounds like a jealous psycho who needs to mind her own business.", "If there is an emergency, the grandmother can handle it.  She\u2019s just as capable of getting the baby to the WR as the parents are.", "Yes, it is the same! Babies can form bonds of attachment with different people! What about babies who don\u2019t have moms (moms died or gay couples)? does that mean they don\u2019t love anyone and have no secure attachment with anyone? \n\nI do understand babies, I study child development and babies will not get trauma or anything like that unless it\u2019s severe gross abuse and neglect! Not something like leaving baby with Safe secure caregivers for 5 days!", "Wasn't commenting on the MIL at all.", "Maybe, but she refers to them as \"our other 2 children.\" The most accurate interpretation of that description with no other information is that they are all their bio kids.\n\nEven regardless of that, the point is the age gap and that existed with the kids or not.", "But would she want to look after all 3 of OP's kids?\n\nWhen my mom came to look after my kids for a long weekend, my brother drove her over and stayed with her. When I came home I discovered that the thick Porterhouse and T-Bones I was saving for special occasions were gone from the freezer. Still worth it to get a few glorious days away with the husband!", "Unless she\u2019s the grandma from the other post who just fed a newborn karo syrup\u2026", "It's not the same. It's not mum. They know. You have no idea what small life moment can form a pathway for a infant or child. If you're studying child development you should know this.", "Found the MIL!  \u261d\ufe0f", "Sheesh!  I haven\u2019t seen that post.", "It doesn\u2019t have to be mom!!! Children can securely attach to any adult that is their caregiver, and still feel the same way as they would their biological mom! What about kids who are adopted as infants? Or whose moms leave or die? Or gay couples? Are you saying those kids are neglected because they don\u2019t have a mom? \n\nIn childhood development, safe secure healthy attachment does not automatically mean it\u2019s with the mom - that\u2019s literally one of the first things we\u2019re thought about attachment! \n\nYes, small life moments can impact - but not before 12months unless it\u2019s actual neglect and abuse"]}
