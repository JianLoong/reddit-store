To be fair, it is the signature spatula of a celebrity chef I like to watch on YouTube. I also have one of his knives. But, it just made me feel completely worthless. I take care of all the cooking at home and I\u2019m happy to do so, but I felt like this was like one of those tv episodes where the husband gets the wife a vacuum, but in reverse. I told her how it made me feel and now she\u2019s mad at me because she said she was trying to be thoughtful and that no one has ever reacted like this to a gift she\u2019s given them. She says the fact that I\u2019m not considering how she tried to be thoughtful is wrong and that she\u2019ll just not ever try to buy a gift for me again. The last bit is her being hyperbolic but she\u2019s pissed.\n\nFor context, for her present, since I have taken a swing and missed in the past, she sends me 3-5 things to select from, and then I get her one of them. This is admittedly less romantic in a way, but she gets things she really likes or wants and there is still some surprise factor. Her items she\u2019s named are purses or jewelry, and I have never once said no to any item she\u2019s requested.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: Interesting perspectives and useful feedback, some good things for me to learn and think about. Quick view, yea I'm the asshole. You shouldn't react that way to a gift, period. However, wife does need to consider why I felt that way and we need to talk about it.\n\nInfo:\n1) This is the spatula: [Brad Leone Spatula](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwif5v3s24r8AhUUlcgKHV9QAegYABAJGgJxdQ&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESa-D2lIEo7BidBV56BIN_480DK-XR8WXHtqTL-QPe7XgHbiMPRw9FwA8JzFtViEXScOcSZb4_Jx6edPvsyNnFAEvU1EOjkZf9HGIMczcKAjdUqgDd5eyg-jpwVMzllhfAbuYDCtHOYpjMwVRv&sig=AOD64_1CvGeFRpPVVEbS0kQE1K8ptsRn7w&ctype=5&q=&ved=2ahUKEwjEjPbs24r8AhVGmHIEHVKZDA8Q9aACKAB6BAgFEA4&adurl=)\n\n2) I have not given her a list before, she's usually been ok with gifts. I am one of those dude's who is a bit difficult to buy things for. However, the first thing I though was \"ok, I think we should both just do a list to avoid this.\" OR do a list for the big thing and then do something small and thoughtful.\n\n3) The swing and a miss that prompted the list was a gold and diamond necklace from Saks which doesn't fit with her style. She never wears it, only breaks it out when I give the not so subtle \"hey so how about my necklace tonight?\" I am not super capable when it comes to picking out fashion items that fit with her style. We go shopping for her and I just look around the store and go... fuck what is all this nonsense. \n\n4) I do really like cooking, but it's become more of a job and less of a hobby, and so less enjoyable then it used to be. I still really enjoy going full out and making a multi course meal and trying new and interesting recipes, but just getting dinner on the table every night once I get home from work is... work.\n\n5) Communication! My wife and I both work 10-12 hour a day jobs and we have a sub-2 year old toddler who is going through a long phase of not sleeping in his own room. We have also been dealing with some additional external issues which I will not detail here which take even more of our free time and energy. This has left us with little to no time or energy for each other and I think we both feel a little neglected. Once we are both done working, and get the kid put down, if one of us isn't in the bed with him, we both just want to curl up with the phone for a few minutes to decompress before its time to sleep. So, in retrospect, my feelings aren't really about the spatula, they're about being overcooked and underattended and unappreciated, and I am sure my wife feels exactly the same way. We NEED to prioritize the relationship so any animosity doesn't find strange and unintended escape hatches. However, validation of my feelings is important, so instead of being mad, if either one of us is like \"blargle fargle friggle fraggle\" unexpectedly, then the question should be \"Ok, what's going on\" and not an escalatory emotional reaction.", "created_utc": 1671597917, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zrakte/aita_for_being_disappointed_in_my_wifes_gift/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And maybe you were not very tactful to tell spouse although in the long run, she made better scores at gift than you did, so she gave up and send you a list to choose from.
