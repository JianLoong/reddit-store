First, a 13 year old does not need an expensive phone.  Second, buying her one while her sibling worked hard to afford is a massive mistake.  It teaches the 13 year old that all they have to do is get angry and her parents will give in to her demands.  Being embarrassed over not having an iPhone is such a first world problem it is ridiculous.  I doubt very much her life will be ruined over having the wrong phone.", "NTA \n\nYou set a clear rule - you can have an iphone but you have to pay for it. \n\nYour husband is wrong here as well, because it wouldn't be fair to the 16 year old who has saved her money and brought one herself if the 13 year old just gets one brought for her \n\nYour 13 year old is acting entitled - stand your ground on this", "NTA.

If she wants a new iphone then she can work for it, just like her older sister did.\n\nOne thought, if you get her a cheaper new/refurbished phone, then make the offer that you are willing to match any $$$ she earns over the new year for a brand new top shelf iphone for either her birthday or Christmas of next year!!!

Stand your ground!", "NTA. \n\nThe 13 year old not liking the fact that her sister has a better phone doesn\u2019t make it unfair at all.  \n\nShe can work and save the same as her sister did.  THAT would be fair.  To give her one would be unfair to the older sister.", "ESH except the 16-year old. You caved and offered the younger daughter a $450 iphone, so you are already rewarding bad behavior.", "NTA, your husband maybe is an AH, 13yr old needs explaining from 16yr old that she saved up and got an iphone.", "I was leaning towards NTA, but then I saw *\"says that all her friends have iphones and it's embarrassing not to have one\"* part.

Don't buy her the iPhone. You have ground rules in place to ensure fairness, and I agree that an iPhone is not a necessity for a 13yo.

If you get her phone, you'll show your older daughter she worked hard for nothing and she could have just thrown a fit to get the phone. Likewise, you'll show your younger daughter that all she needs to do in the future is to cry and throw her toys out of the pram and she'll get what she wants. \n\nNTA", "It would be unfair to buy her an iphone when your other girl earned hers.", "NTA. Your 16 year old is going to HATE the 13 year old if you buy the young one an iPhone while she saved up for hers. \n\nYour kid needs manners and discipline, and your husband is an enabler. \n\nAnd I think it\u2019s a bit sad that she\u2019s 13 and is so affected by not having the latest technology and that it is embarrassing etc. why is she so pressured by society and what can you do to improve her own self confidence so that this doesn\u2019t matter? \n\nYou should continue telling her to do chores etc and save up for it. Her sister did it. She has no right to be angry. Entitlement is huge in her case and if she can\u2019t be grateful then, she can have nothing.", "NTA. First of all a teenager doesn't need an expensive phone. Second, if she really wanted one, she should try and save up like her sister. Third, if u buy her an iphone, it would be unfair to the older sister. Fourth, you'll be spoiling her. If you give in to her tantrums and stuffs. Teach her she has to earn things in life.", "NTA. Yeah kids are tough, and teenagehood is complicated, but put your foot down and enforce some boundaries before you kid becomes a spoiled, entitled, brat. You can't undo parenting unfortunately.", "NTA.\n\nMy daughter wants for nothing, and even she finds this request ridiculous. Keep that foot down Mom. Money doesn't grow on trees.", "NTA.\n\nIt isn\u2019t unfair. Her sister saved up and paid for the iPhone herself, if she\u2019s envious her sister has an iphone, then she should save up too.

Just like the other daughter did.  Throwing a tissy fit to get one\u2019s way is not how it\u2019s done.\n\nLet her know ways to earn money and create a goal so she can buy it herself!\n\nDon\u2019t give in- this is a life lesson.\n\nJust because other kids have them doesn\u2019t mean she gets one by behaving entitled.\n\nNta.  Stand your ground", "Nta but you would be if you caved\nThe older child saved up and got themselves an iPhone. You just caving and buying the younger child one sets a precedent for future behaviour. \n\nAnd no, you're not \"ruining her life\". She's 13, she has a functional phone,  she'll be fine", "I\u2019m going to 100% NTA I\u2019m having similar discussion. Both of our daughters got phones a few years ago for there birthdays. They weren\u2019t the best phones. I told them if they could look after the phone for 2 years I\u2019d get them whatever phone they wanted. One of them is on her 5th phone the other had an iPhone for her birthday my husband now uses her old phone that\u2019s how well she took care of it. Other daughter wants an iPhone for Xmas as it\u2019s un fair sister has one husband agrees with daughter I do not. You have rules you must stick to them otherwise it\u2019s unfair on your daughter her brought her own phone.", "Of course you're NTA. A 13-year-old should not have the same rights and responsibilities as a 16-year-old. It's not about the phone. It's about the age difference.", "Silent treatment should get her no phones! \nMy husband and I had to buy a refurbished iPhone 8 just recently. Works amazing and love the camera etc was only around $200. \nI\u2019m sure for $300 you can get a better iPhone that\u2019s refurbished. \nIt\u2019s not fair to her sister who saved her own money if you do what hubby suggested. So unfair.", "NTA. Kids don't need iPhones. She can save money like her sister's and  get one.  If you give in you're breaking your own rule and you're teaching the other kids that if you throw a tantrum you get whatever you want.", "NTA\n\nWork out a compromise with your husband; maybe offer to let him have his way over another contentious issue between the two of you if he will let you have your way this round. Or, consider making him a counter-offer to adjust your spending for the youngest on the condition that you spend the same amount on the older one.", "NTA -working for things when growing up really you really learn to appreciate it more and take care of it when it was you that paid for it. It also teaches her good life lessons that she can\u2019t always get what she wants without working for it.", "NTA. You\u2019re being very fair and I understand peer pressure and wanting to fit in but at the end of the day it\u2019s bullshit dynamics and she\u2019ll get over it soon enough. I bet if you took her Samsung away she\u2019ll be begging you to have it back just to have a phone\u2026 any phone. \n\nI\u2019d be very unfair for your 16 y/o to have worked and saved up to buy their own iPhone for their sister to then get one just because.\n\nAt the end of the day I personally believe it is also important to un-teach kids the \u201cneed\u201d to buy something just because it\u2019s newer instead of using what you already have until the end of its useful life. She does not need a new phone.", "NTA- I was actually in a pretty similar situation to your 13 yo once. I went to a very privileged school but my parents weren\u2019t rich by any means. It lead to me thinking it was super unfair that all the other kids had high tech phones and designer clothing. My parents eventually did get the money to buy me a new phone but honestly I recognise that them giving me a lot of the things I\u2019ve asked for has made it a little hard for me to accept rejection. I\u2019m grateful for what they\u2019ve done for me but\u2026 yeah take it as a lesson that at best, your 13 yo will find rejection hard in the future if you start giving in to her demands now.", "NTA but if you can afford that, you can suggest that you can give her 300 dollars so that she will only need to save for the rest of the iPhones price. The other kid apparently needs to get the same value gift\u2026", "You\u2019d be the TA is you brought her the phone. If she wants one she can save up like her sister did", "NTA because I think you're being pretty reasonable. A $300 limit is more than enough to get a decent phone for a teenager. If they want a more expensive phone badly enough, I'm sure they will be willing to save up for one. It is a good thing for them to learn the value of what their money can buy if they choose that route; meawhile, it can teach them treat their things with better care on their dime.", "NTA. A 13 year old screaming ur ruining her life sounds pretty common during puberty. Furthermore, ur other daughter worked hard for her IPhone and just giving one to the other now will surely create a massive rift. And a 13yr old most definitely doesn\u2019t need a phone that expensive, especially since u provide them with smartphones making sure that they r not excluded. \nTLDR: Don\u2019t cave in", "NTA Under ABSOLUTELY NOT CIRCUMSTANCES JUST BUY ONE OF YOUR DAUGHTERS SOMETHING THAT THE OTHER HAS WORKED FOR. Everybody who things not doing so is \"unfair\" needs a massive sit down.  Coals for your 13yo and your husband this Christmas.\n\nIn general, I find your spending policy very reasonable. If parents can afford it, equipment should be provided. A phone, a contract, a computer (gaming capable if desired). If the kids want more than the economic option (which may well be mid range, if that allows for longer product life) though, than they need join in with the costs.", "NTA - from what I've gathered from my kids it is pretty common for teenagers to want an iPhone because all their mates airdrop stuff in class and use FaceTime. If her birthday is only in February offer to give her just money for Christmas and her birthday, if she wants it enough to save everything from you and other relatives I'd imagine she'll have enough to get some sort of decent iPhone.", "NTA, \n\n1. Your eldest Daughter saved up the remaining Money towards her iPhone, this will set a standard that if you have a hissy fit you will get what you want.\n2. Your Husband is looking for just the easiest way out not to have a headache from the moaning and is lookingto pacify the youngest rather than teaching her the lesson of saving and buying your own things.\n\nIf you want a bratty needy child in the future then go ahead and buy her the phone, your eldest will be resentful and it will drive a wedge between them. Youngest has already been given the option of a phone and turned it down even though you have given the opportunity to earl more money and buy one.\n\nMy younger sister used to do this sorta thing and now she is 32 and still believes the world owes her something and she deserves it instead of earning it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStick to your guns Mum, hope Dad sees sense as you are so not the asshole for establishing financial boundaries at a young but impressionable age", "NTA \nFirst off the oldest worked hard and paid for hers. Second a 13yr old doesn\u2019t need an expensive phone. It\u2019s not ok to make the oldest buy her own and then because the youngest throws a fit she gets one without working for it.", "Your NTA.\n\nAnd giving an 800 dollar phone to a kid is a mistake.\nUnless they earned that money.\nBecause they do not know what 800 dollars means unless they have made an effort for it.\n\nSaying \" you are ruining her life\" because of it reflects that she is not ready.\n\nWhat would happen next \" oh I need a 1000 thousand phone otherwise I would not be popular\" and it is An endless circle.\n\nShe needs to learn what money means and money would not allow her to keep people close.\nIt is better to learn now then later on.", "NTA - what is it with all these posts where older/younger siblings have to have the same thing to be fair when one of the children worked their asses off to save the money for it. Just because your oldest daughter has one doesnt mean your youngest needs one. The rules were clear, $300 or less for a phone and you can save to upgrade on your own terms. It is simple and its a good life lesson to the youngest. Dont give in", "NTA my daughter was lucky to get my old halndmedown phone. If the kids pay with their own money they can have what they want. \n\nI'll leave my Android phones are superior rant as far off this topic as I can. Which it turns out isn't mucj", "NTA. Don't budge from your decision. Your elder daughter saved her money to buy it. She must have done tonnes of chores or worked part-time to afford it. If you simply buy the younger daughter an iphone it would basically look like you are playing favorites. Also, in no scenario does a 13-year-old need an iphone 15, no matter how rich you are. If you buy her the phone now, who knows, she might throw a tantrum at her 16th birthday to buy her an expensive car since throwing tantrums worked well for her last time.", "NTA. I literally didn\u2019t get my own cellphone until I was 18-19 bc I grew up low income. They just think you\u2019re ruining their life right now because they\u2019re 13 but they\u2019ll appreciate it later", "NTA - the older daughter worked, teach the younger daughter the value of working for something as well and that diffuses any favoritism. A phone model unfortunately is a symbol of status these days but you can teach that lesson as well - a phone is a utility. My kids first phones were not iPhones\u2026they\u2019re unnecessarily expensive compared to other devices.", "NTA\n\nDon't buy a the phone, it will teach her that she just have to be angry and she will gets what she wants. Plus your oldest daughter will probably be angry at you as well since she had to buy her phone herself.\n\nFor example when I was a teenager I wanted the ps3 but my family didn't wanted to buy it for Christmas so I saved up a few birthdays and Christmas and in the end I could even afford the ps4 when it came out.\n\nYour younger daughter can do the same", "Then it won't be fair that your oldest had to save to buy one yet she just got it given to her. You won't win either way. The youngest should save up just like the oldest did", "NTA, my daughter (10) has an iPhone, but only because I had a new phone and I passed it on to her (think it\u2019s an \u2018xr\u2019, it was my husband\u2019s first!). When she\u2019s older and wants her own phone and not my hand me downs she can save for it herself. Currently she uses the phone to play games etc because we haven\u2019t bought her a sim yet.", "NTA.\n\nAs a former 13 year old who pestered her day to give a phone because everyone had. I am so glad I got it only when I was 15 or 16. Goodness, there's more to life than that.\n\nAlso you are exactly right. If she wants to she can save up. No ones stopping her. You can't be a brat and accuse your parents of being unfair at the same time lmao.", "NTA. If you buy the younger an Iphone you are setting a bad precedent: she can get what she wants just throwing a fit.\n\nI would be unfair to your oldest, who worked hard to get it.   \nPlus, and this is just personal opinion, few people really need and expensive phone, its just a whim, not a real need. It is legitimate to have an expensive phone even so, but is important to know the difference.", "NTA. My first phone at 13 was my dad\u2019s old iPhone 6. When I wanted a new phone Facebook marketplace is the way to go. Just check serial number and IMEI when buying second hand stuff to authenticate", "NTA. A 13yo doesn't need an iPhone, and if she wants one, she can save up for it like her sister did.", "If im not mistaken, an iphone se is only like 3-400 so if she really wants a phone and it has to be cheap you can look into that. Battery life isnt great but its a phone.", "Nta. \n\nMy first phone was a Nokia, hes grateful he ever gotten a phone in the first place.", "NTA\nI have two brothers, close in age. I'm some older. When we were kids, because I was older, I'd get a privilege first and the rest of the kids (there were more) would be told, when you're older, you can stay up later, or whatever.  We are now in our 70s. The older brother is still salty that every time he got a privilege or an item, right away the younger one got it too. I guess it was easier for our parents to think of them as a unit. But not really fair.\n\nMy point is that it is OK for the older child to have things that the younger must wait for. It's OK to ignore complaints that all her friends have X, she needs X too. (What a typical kid argument.. haha)  It's also OK to use a Samsung S8 at age 13.", "NTA!! If she doesn\u2019t like it, she can get one herself, which is exactly what the 16 yo did. \nI was in the same situation. Mum didn\u2019t think smart phones / phones with selfie cameras were appropriate for a child, think I was 15 at the time. I got a smart phone then, a Nokia one which was actually fine but it didn\u2019t have a camera on the front. After a year or so I just decided I really wanted an iPhone, and I\u2019d been working a couple of jobs at the weekend so I had it saved up and I just bought it myself. At the time, I felt it was unfair because everyone else my age had one, but now I\u2019m older I realise my mum was right. I had a lot of other stuff other kids didn\u2019t have, I totally get her safety concerns etc. \n\n13 years old is kinda young for an iPhone I think. I didn\u2019t have anything like that at that age, think at 14/15 I had an iPod touch. Stick to your guns and let her buy it herself.", "Your older daughter has an iPhone because she saved her money and was able to afford one on her own.  Why your husband can't seem to see that is beyond me.  It isn't necessary to buy your younger daughter an expensive iPhone just because her older sister has one or because all her friends have them or because she doesn't think the situation is fair.  Personally I wouldn't spend that kind of money on a gift either.  A phone is a phone and your daughter's current phone works fine.  Put your foot down mom and stick to your guns.  If your daughter wants an iPhone then she can figure out ways to save up money and buy herself one, just like her sister did.  She'll also learn the valuable life lesson that money doesn't grow on trees and life isn't always fair.", "NTA, kid sounds like a classic spoiled brat. Also I'd vote just to get them a used iphone x or something similar in price?", "Nta", "Well blame the society for peer pressure and of course the phone is a teenagers whole life now . I have an iphone but prefer samsung the quality is acutally better . The iphone isn't better but the society made is a status symbol so when you are poor you are not one of us .\n\nDon't blame your daughter for wanting to be accepted , blame society for looking down on others\n\nIt would be horrible wrong to buy your younger daughter an iphone when your oldest saved up her money , that would mean you would have to give your oldest the same amount so $1600 for both , otherwise your olders would have every right to be pissed", "NTA You need to point out that her sister wanted one and worked for it and if she really wants one that badly she'll work for it as well.

A phone has no bearing on who she is as a person. Second it is fair. Her sister bought herself an iPhone.  This is a learning opportunity.", "When I was a kid I saved for months to buy myself a CD player. My older brother complained to our parents that I got one before he did, so they bought him a fancy hi-fi. I felt completely betrayed, and I still resent them for it 30 years later.", "NTA.  Absolutely correct, if she wants a different phone she can get a job like her sibling did. Do not give in to her anger.", "Exactly. \nKids don't need expensive phones, they just need functioning ones. Especially since they're often far less careful with them than adults.\n\nAnd it would send both kids the wrong message if you gave in. The 13 year old would learn that all she needs to do is throw a fit, while the 16 year old sees giant favoritism in her sibling getting things SHE had to work hard for to afford to buy.\nIt also doesn't teach the 13 year old the value of items and money. \n\nSo it would be an allround terrible parenting choice to give in.\n\nNTA.", "\u261d\ufe0fThis is the right answer, trying to push it up. It's important to learn that hard work pays of. Your kids can learn this, or they learn that creating drama pays of.", ">buying her one while her sibling worked hard to afford is a massive mistake.  It teaches the 13 year old that all they have to do is get angry and her parents will give in to her demands. \n\nThis is the absolute most important part. \n\nYou absolutely cannot make one kid work to earn a thing then gift the other kid that thing. It teaches both kids that hard work is useless. It also teaches some lessons about which kid you value most that are lessons you don't want to be teaching. \n\nYou get nothing good from doing this, only all bad. \n\nYour oldest's hard work *has* to result in a better outcome. \n\nLet me suggest an idea that achieves that outcome but gets baby sister an iphone.\n\nYou could buy 16 a brand new one, to reward her hard work, on the condition that she give her sister her current phone as a hand me down. That's a compromise on your part that still acknowledges everyone else's good points about phones. \n\nNTA - please stick to your guns about not buying your 13 year old a brand new phone.", "Right? And it teaches her older sibling that there's no point in hard work.\nMy (now) 13, almost 14 yo son has all the latest consoles. I don't play games, never had, not used to it so I didn't \"needed \" them. I wasn't against him having them, just not at my expense. He saved all his gifts money, minus the part I established thar goes into a saving account on his name, and bought them all himself", "Right? I'm certain not all her friends even have a phone and the ones that do, don't all have brand new iPhones.", "If she is so embarrassed, ask her to give you back her phone.

She has a phone suitable for what a 13 year old needs. Her outburst proves she isn't mature enough for an expensive item (which isn't meant as a negative, she is 13 and her brain is far from full development). This isn't like the parents refusing to buy her sporting equipment for a hobby she's really invested in or even something required for school to succeed.", "Husband may be why 13 is like this\u2026", "If op does that, they should match was the older daughter spent on her iPhone. My mom did a deal like that with my sibs but didn\u2019t uphold it for me and I absolutely resented that. Freebies are freebies. If the kid didn\u2019t have to work for it, the other kid is going to be resentful.", "Also, then the older sister would feel robbed too.

OP, NTA and stick to your guns,!,!", "I feel like I am missing some sort of broadcast on why \u00a3100s on something that can get lost/stolen easily and rendered obsolete in 2 years is worth this drama.

You are animosity in the relationships.\n\nIs 13, daddy's favourite? \ud83e\udd14 \n\nI really don't like the fu to 16, by giving this deal to 13.", "Let them cook, as they say, rules are rules, no relaxing the rules after the first one endured it all, then it would show who is favourited more. \n\nHusband is the AH, you are not.\n\n13 sounds spoiled. \n\n16 sounds mature.", "When my kid was about that age, he lost *2* mid range expensive phones. After that, he got a flip phone and had to use that until he could prove himself responsible for a better phone. He did. It was a good lesson (for all of us)", "Yup, no means no!

Let the kid be kid...", "Phone culture these days is ridiculous.  I get it, I was a teenager too and these things seem like they matter but I could never fathom spending that much on a phone when \u00a3200 phones are as good as they are now.

Count me out.", "How is it fair that the 16 year old had to work and pay for her own iPhone but all the 13 year old has to do is whine and she gets one? It's not teaching her any responsibility to just be given an 800 dollar phone. She's 13, she doesn't need an 800 dollar phone. The offer is a 300 dollar one or nothing. That is not fair to the older sister and it would be playing favorites. Who cares of she'd take care of it or not, that's besides the point. That's the problem with kids today, they whine and throw a fit and parents just throw money at the kid instead of actually parenting.  No one *deserves* an 800 dollar phone, end of.", "This!\n\nAlso some people saying OP is \"raising\" an entitled child. No, people just have a sense of entitlement that can have nothing to do with the way they're raised. Also, she's 13.

I got a \u00a379 Alba one from Argos.\n\nMy sister wanted an avery and birds etc so my dad built a 25'x10' avery and bought quails, finches, cockatiels and parakeets to fill it... And also built a chicken coop and chickens. All of which my sister agreed she'd look after them all by cleaning and feeding them.\nShe did for a year, then my parents made ME do it.\nI'd get up at 5:45am to do a paper round, get home for 7am, feed the birds and put fresh water down, have a bite to eat and catch the bus to college. I'd do a full day there, bus home then started working at a supermarket at 6pm to 10pm. \n\nAll throughout our lives, she has been given money, cars, shopping etc as \"she needs it more\".\nMy parents lent me \u00a315k once so we could pay a deposit on a house whilst our old house was being sold. I paid them back 6 months later and they asked for \u00a3850 in interest.\n\nWhen my mother died, she got a sum of money, jewellery etc I got \u00a3500; the same amount they left to their gardener.\n\nBefore my mother died, my mum and dad told me that when the last of them goes, the house and assets will be split so my sister gets 70% and my other sister and I get 15% each.\n\nI can't comprehend why we were treated so differently but explains why my eldest moved far, far away and I no longer have a relationship with my whole family.", "I completely understand your resentment but I don't understand the parent's logic.
