She does yoga 3 times a week and is incredibly flexible and agile. She told me she would talk to her sister as she's a personal trainer. I agreed, my girlfriend,myself, and her younger sister as the teacher have been doing yoga twice a week at my house for the last 3 weeks. I feel fantastic and really feel that it has been helping me. \n\nYesterday, my mother called me asking me if I was still going to give her the freezer I no longer used. I said yes and told her to come get it or I would take it to her the next day. The freezer is in my garage where we do yoga. I usually do it shirtless and my girlfriend and her sister are in sports bra and sweats. \n\nIn the middle of our yoga session I get a notification that someone was at my front door, it was my mom and dad . I headed to the door while putting on a shirt but I asked my girlfriend and her sister to put on a top also. My girlfriend gave me daggers for eyes and her sister gave me a confused \"who the hell are you\" look. \n\nI said please because my parents were coming in. I let my parents in and when I come back, they still are in their sports bras. My parents greet them and leave shortly after. My girlfriends sister ends up leaving before we finish the session and told me that I am no longer her client because she's the teacher and she felt I  disrespected her.\n\nI was confused and asked my girlfriend what she meant. She said \"dude, she has big boobs. She gets shitted on like that all the time. You need to apologize like now. I'll let it go but you're a dick\" I told her I will clear things up with her sister but I will no apologize because I didn't mean it that way. My girlfriend doesn't believe me and thinks I was trying to police her and her sister. \n\nI did start to think about it and her sister is a good person and am thinking I did overstep the boundaries. I don't feel I did.", "created_utc": 1674959006, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10nwgww/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_and_her_sister_to/", "score": 11460, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it was appropriate to be around you, it\u2019s appropriate to be around others. You are directly sexualizing them\u2014especially the little sister, who is doing her job. If you were uncomfortable with them having their shirts on and working out in sports bras, you should\u2019ve stated that from the beginning. Instead, your actions tell them that you are either ashamed of their bodies and how they dress, or you only think you should be able to look at them in sports bras.", "YTA. God forbid someone see two women in 100% appropriate workout gear.", "Yes yta absolutely.  They can go to any gym like that,  the beach,  any yoga studio,  jogging outside..  etc but heaven forbid your parents see women in work out gear.

You are wrong and need to apologize", "NTA.\n\nThere are no Aholes here, although there are a lot of people getting offended.   \n\nYou covered up as a gesture of respect to your parents.

No. Was he saying to cover up to avoid being raped by his parents?

Neither your girlfriend nor her sister were in a state of undress, they were in workout attire that they would be able to wear at the store, running errands, etc. If they had been in their underwear this would be a different issue. The rule your parents were trying to teach you about what to wear in front of guests was probably not \"shirts vs no shirts\" it was \"can you wear this in public.\" This on top of the fact that they were in the middle of a workout (and not, like, idk about to accompany you to a religious service or host a formal dinner or some other thing where more formal dress would be expected) makes you TA.", "YTA.

Not because I\u2019m not proud of my body or because I feel like I shouldn\u2019t be allowed to wear that working out, but because your parents/guests came. Just respectful.

I do wear it to work out alone or with my partner or sister...it just seems like maybe they were raised differently? Maybe you might have phrased it differently, like, \"heads up my parents are here.\" Instead of, \"hey put on some clothes.\" But I feel like they're making a mountain out of something pretty innocuous.", "I want people here to keep that same energy when they see a guy in a speedo", "YTA - these women were at your place doing you a favour and you shamed them for dressing appropriately for yoga.", "NTA nothing wrong with being respectful to your parents, you obviously knew they\u2019d find it inappropriate.

It seems like a lot of people are adding their own context to this story so that they can justify calling OP an asshole.\n\nIf I was you and I wanted my gf's sister to keep teaching me then I'd suck it up and try to see it from her perspective before apologizing. Sometimes dealing with other people's emotions isn't always about being right or wrong.", "NAH\n\nThe sister was doing you a favour, dressed in a way appropriate for that favour to be done. \n\nWhen someone is doing you a favour, you don't get to dictate anything, even if your parents are coming over. \n\nIt's on YOU to make sure your parents do not interrupt your GFs sister's favour to you, and if they do, you don't really have the right to ask a yoga teacher to wear \"more clothes\" since this is quite literally what she wears at work, and if it isn't appropriate for your parents delicate sensibilities then maybe don't have your parents over in the middle of the professional doing you a favour in her professional attire? \n\nIf you truly could not avoid this situation, saying something like \"Sorry, my parents are weirdos about modesty, and they're coming in to get x, so it would be great if you could put on a shirt over the sports crop\" is the better way to go.", "YTA they were wearing workout clothes WHILE working out, what\u2019s the issue?", "[deleted]", "NTA. OP, I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re from, but you have to remember most of the people who post here on Reddit are from western or pretty socially liberal countries, which is likely why you\u2019re getting many \u201cYTA\u201d. They are not used to this. I don\u2019t know the details, but as long as you asked respectfully, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an issue. The range of nakedness that is socially acceptable is dependent on the culture. When I am in America on a beach, I wear bikinis, when I  am back home, I wear a swim shirt and shorts. \n\nThis may not be the case for you, but I\u2019m just throwing it out there.", "NTA. Everyone seems to forget that you put a shirt on as well. It's your home, and it's reasonable to ask anyone to cover when someone else comes over, even if it's a brief amount of time. I feel like your GF and her sister totally overreacted. You didn't make a lewd comment about anyone's anatomy.", "YTA. If you didn\u2019t mean it that way, then why won\u2019t you apologise? Sure, it could seem like a somewhat harmless request to you if your parents are super conservative but you unintentionally insulted/embarrassed your gf\u2019s sister and that warrants an apology.\n\nAlso, they were wearing workout clothes and they were in the middle of working out. Their clothes; their business. There\u2019s nothing wrong with women wearing sports bras when working out.", "This may be an unpopular opinion but NTA since OP himself covered up before opening the door. He was in the process of wearing a shirt and asked them as well. \n\nIt could be of cultural significance or it could just be that he knows his parents will not be comfortable. Either way, he walked the walk before requesting the same from them.", "NAH You put your own shirt on, I get respecting your parents.  But I can also see where an apology is not a bad idea.  My suspicion is you and your girl friend may have been brought up differently in regards to \"modesty\".", "NTA. It\u2019s respect for your parents. Its not offensive for you to ask guests to be a little more dressed around your parents than when they are working out. Same reason I can go workout or run without a shirt on, but I\u2019d put a shirt on if a roommate or a friends parents were going to see me.", "Is everyone skipping over the fact that HE PUT ON A SHIRT ALSO. He didn\u2019t single the girls out and he only said it was for a few minutes until his parents leave. No one is sexualizing anything here, if so then he wouldn\u2019t have put on a shirt and only told them to put one on. It\u2019s more of a respect thing, than a \u201csexualizing\u201d thing and people in the comments seems to have failed to realize that!!!

If I am the homeowner I chose to have a guest in my home yes we all need to be dressed appropriately and yes I would require my kids wear shirts. Normal life wear a shirt. Your parents came over for a favor and to do a task and the people in your home were dressed appropriately for the activity - working out - so no\nModification was needed", "INFO: I feel like we're missing something about how you made the request (tone, phrasing, something). Possible you phrased the request in a way that was bound to be taken poorly?", "YTA", "Personally?  I don\u2019t think it costs anybody anything to be modest - if your parents weren\u2019t comfortable seeing the sports bras, I think the considerate thing to do was to cover up.", "Que downvotes because NTA. You put on a shirt to greet your parents. Nowadays a sports bra is a legitimate shirt to wear in public, but not for older generations. It\u2019s a sign of respect that you didn\u2019t want your parents to be confronted with more skin than they want to see. Your GFs sister is the one who made it all about herself and sexualized herself. I dare say it was less about boobs and more about *bare midriffs*. GF and sister are being silly and self-centered.", "YTA.  You girlfriend already told you why.   Also they weren't greeting your parents.  That happened when you answered the door", "NTA, I don\u2019t really see the problem here, Al you did was ask?

The only reason I wear a shirt over mine is because I\u2019m older.  YTA", "NAH, but you should apologize. It's just like when a you accidentally step on someone's toes, it still stung.

Ever.", "What the fucks wrong with all these ppl saying yta?\nDo you all greet your SO's parents in underwear?", "Nta.  You put on your shirt it clearly wasnt about their boobs.  It wasnt an unreasonable request they chose to take it personally because society has told them to the last few years.  I wouldnt wear a sports bra infront of my in laws and I'd be mortified if they saw me in one.", "NTA your house your rules. She\u2019s being overly sensitive about her \u201cbig boobs\u201d, who gives a shit about those put a shirt on you disrespectful nutbag.", "NTA- did y'all miss where he put on a shirt himself? He's not being sexist, just asking they *also* cover up because his parents are over. Whether you agree with him or not he's setting boundaries for all of them, not just the women.", "Nta, nothing wrong with wanting to be a bit more dressed up when you have company coming in, especially family.\n\nIt's literally your house. They are guests.\n\nAnd while it's true that sometimes your intent and her understanding will not match up, probably you don't stick to your guns and assume the worst in someone. She should be apologizing to you for assuming the worst because she translated her feelings about other people onto you, which isn't fair.\n\nYou also weren't just requesting that they cover. You first covered yourself and then requested out of politeness for other guests that they also cover temporarily.\n\nSounds like you're getting bitched at by a bunch of people who haven't had stable familial relationships", "NTA!  You were asking out of respect for your parents nothing more. Plus you put your shirt on too - and that fact makes a difference. I do HOWEVER think you should apologize to your girlfriend\u2019s sister not only to keep the peace, but there seems to be a misunderstanding of your intentions plus she seems to have bad past history of how those words have impacted her.", "NTA\n\nYour house your rules!", "YTA. Dude. They're wearing normal yoga attire. A sports bra or tanktop and sweats is more common than being shirtless.", "Based on your reaction I guessing your parents are old fashioned and wouldn't approve of that particular situation. My vote NAH", "YTA\n\nThis isn't asking someone to respect a house of religion or a temple or anywhere that normally has a dress code. You made two women uncomfortable because you felt some sort of way. It's your parents job to deal with their own (is they even have any) issues from judging others clothes. It was not your place to run interference in a group of adults before the group was even in the same room. You owe both ladies an apology.", "YTA - point, period, blank.

You put a shirt on as well. \n\nYou can however apologize for saying something that upset them, even though it wasn\u2019t your intent.\n\nSimply say that you were considering your parents sensibilities and not setting up  a conflict with them and hadn\u2019t thought through how your girlfriend and you sister would feel. And that you realise now that that was unfair and you should have explained and asked if they could it as a favor to you only because it\u2019s your parents.\n\nExplain that you don\u2019t have their experiences and so you\u2019re not as aware of the issue as you probably should be. Maybe they could talk to you, in generalities, about their experiences so you can get a better sense of such concerns,\n\nBecause something is really close to us we can forget than others won\u2019t be aware of it in the same way because they don\u2019t have our experiences and we should be open to giving people the benefit of the doubt, particularly with a partner who you have no real reason to doubt.\n\nSpeaking as a big boobed woman who never once was told to cover up and wouldn\u2019t have batted an eye at your request and would have assumed was related to your guests at the door.", "NTA. I can understand where OP is coming from, especially if you\u2019re older. It\u2019s a sign of respect for you elders to dress modestly or semi modestly.

You were covering up and asked your guests to cover up for a few minutes while your parents picked up a freezer.

When my family comes over I'm not gonna walk around in booty shorts and a sports bra unless we're all exercising. Context matters for clothing.", "NTA Its not that weird to ask them to cover up when your parents come over ESPECIALLY because you immediately did the same. They should have taken the cue from you about how formal their attire should be around your parents. \n\nI would be extremely uncomfortable meeting someone's parents whether it was the first time or if they were family friends in just a sport bra, but that's not everybody. In some people's houses that would have been completely okay. However the fact that your immediate reaction was to put on shirt tells me that was not your parent's house.\n\nAs for the younger sister. I would still apologize but maybe discuss if this really should continue. Her storming out could be more about how she should be compensated for the private lessons and has been resenting the loss of income than her big boobs. If its honestly the big boobs then idk man, you can't solve her insecurities but you're not a dick for asking her to put on a shirt for your parents.", "You don't get to tell a woman to put on more cloths. Nope. \n\nYou especially don't when you're doing something scheduled that it is common practice to wear a sports bra to put on clothes because your parents happen pass by. Your parents don't deserve more consideration then someone helping you and taking time out of their schedule to help you.\n\nYou don't interrupt yoga, which is in part a focus activity, you quietly excuse yourself and hope they forgive you. That is the etiquette in yoga. You shouldn't even have your notifications on.  \n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nYour parents told you they felt something was rude so you tried to accommodate them, that's polite.  But, you don't get to tell your houseguests what to do, and frankly you should not have scheduled your parents coming over during the yoga class.  \n\nThe sister told you what she felt comfortable with and you should also try to respect that and apologize for offending her.  Just because you didn't intend anything negative doesn't mean you you shouldn't apologize.", "NTA if this was round the other way and the their parents were coming round for the fridge and they said hey do you mind throwing on a shirt while they are here, you'd have just did it and thats the end of it. \n\nThis whole thing of women feel they can just wear anything anywhere because it's their body their choice is ridiculous. Other people exist in the world and you need to be respectful of them. It's such a double standard, If a guy was walking around wearing nothing but tiny shorts so tight you could see the outline of his dick people would be outraged. \n\nAnd before anyone gets all offended, I'm not saying women need to cover up anything that could possibly be sexualised as soon as other people could potentially see them.

She does yoga 3 times a week and is incredibly flexible and agile. She told me she would talk to her sister as she's a personal trainer. I agreed, my girlfriend,myself, and her younger sister as the teacher have been doing yoga twice a week at my house for the last 3 weeks. I feel fantastic and really feel that it has been helping me. \n\nYesterday, my mother called me asking me if I was still going to give her the freezer I no longer used. I said yes and told her to come get it or I would take it to her the next day. The freezer is in my garage where we do yoga. I usually do it shirtless and my girlfriend and her sister are in sports bra and sweats. \n\nIn the middle of our yoga session I get a notification that someone was at my front door, it was my mom and dad . I headed to the door while putting on a shirt but I asked my girlfriend and her sister to put on a top also. My girlfriend gave me daggers for eyes and her sister gave me a confused \"who the hell are you\" look. \n\nI said please because my parents were coming in. I let my parents in and when I come back, they still are in their sports bras. My parents greet them and leave shortly after. My girlfriends sister ends up leaving before we finish the session and told me that I am no longer her client because she's the teacher and she felt I  disrespected her.\n\nI was confused and asked my girlfriend what she meant. She said \"dude, she has big boobs. She gets shitted on like that all the time. You need to apologize like now. I'll let it go but you're a dick\" I told her I will clear things up with her sister but I will no apologize because I didn't mean it that way. My girlfriend doesn't believe me and thinks I was trying to police her and her sister. \n\nI did start to think about it and her sister is a good person and am thinking I did overstep the boundaries. I don't feel I did.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It doesn't matter if you meant it \"that way\" or any other way; you told your gf and her sister what to do with their bodies, which is not okay. If you have a problem with them dressing that way in your home, your problem is solved. This woman was doing you a favor by accepting you as a client, and you were unable to treat her with basic respect. YTA.", "YTA. My daughter ran an entire 5k in a sports bra.

I don't believe you meant any harm by it. As a woman I feel comfortable wearing crop tops and spots bras around friends, but if I'm around an older crowd like with my family I don't. My instinct would be to thow a shirt on in your situation too. \n\nThat being said, it still bothered your gf and her sister. Even if you didn't intend to insult, with their prior experiences I can totally see why they took your remarks as they did. There wasn't a problem with their dress before, and your parents showed up unannounced. If you truly didn't mean to insult them, you should have no trouble apologizing. (Like how another commenter said: even if stepping on someone's foot is an accident, you should still apologize for hurting them.)\n\nThere was a miscommunication, so communicate. \"Hey I'm sorry about the other day and I'm sorry for hurting your feelings. Covering up around older folks was always the expectation in my family which is why I put on my shirt and made the request I did. I wasn't trying to imply anything, or make you uncomfortable, but I can see now it wasn't okay to put those same expectations onto you and understand why it hurt you.\"", "In agreement with others in that *by the reaction of the 2 ladies*, you needed to clue in that you offended them.  Doesn't matter that you meant to offend or you didn't mean to.  They were offended. Period. Please apologize for offending both of them. \n\nTip for next time your parents drop by ... ask them to wait at the door (put a bench out or some such for them to be comfortable while they wait), or ask your guests to leave/cut the session short so no one is embarrassed needs to cover up.  Choose the option that suits the situation when you find out about it - don't leave it to a last minute decision where mis-spoken words can hurt others. Think ahead a bit more, please.  YTA, and you need to set boundaries for your \"drop in\" guests.  \n\nFor example, in our home, \"drop ins\" know that we need about 30 minutes head's up before they arrive. Maybe give something like that a try? \n\nPlease do better.", "JFC. Talk about overreacting.  All 3 of you are fucking drama queens.", "I mean...personally I've been in a similar type of situation before.  me and my friend had been in her backyard in our bras and we went inside and I hadn't put my shirt back on yet.  thankfully she had been ahead of me when we went in the house and I heard her say hey dad.  I stopped right in my tracks and put my shirt on before I went any further.\n\nhowever, they were working out...not just randomly walking through the house.", "Lmao wtf is the deal with people?? NTA. I mean, yeah, you could apologize for your parents and how they're from a time where people (MEN *AND* WOMEN) dressed considerably more conservatively and they would be incredibly uncomfortable seeing your gf and another young woman in their bras. You asking for them to respect your parents isn't a shitty thing to do at all! Yeah, ok, if it were something like  \"pretend you're straight, they hate gay people\" or anything like that than absolutely that would be a total dick move but tossing on a t-shirt is literally the easiest thing in the world. Fuck man, if my husband's mom and sister showed up and I was in a t-shirt and underwear, I'd put pants on. If his brother came by and I was in sweats and a sports bra, I'd throw a shirt on. *you* put a shirt on why do they feel like they are above showing that same respect to your parents?

If I was working out in a sports bra and my doorbell rang I\u2019d throw on a shirt or robe whether it was my parents, a delivery man or my mother and father in law. I believe there are truly some guys who \u201cpolice\u201d women\u2019s clothing choices and women get victim blamed for their clothing choices and that obviously disgusting. But I think the women here overreacted. I bet if they didn\u2019t get upset it would have been let go. There is nothing wrong with a little modesty around people you don\u2019t know.

NTA", " YTA\n\nIf you weren't ashamed how they looked, whether in the front of your mind or in your subconscious, you never would have said anything regardless of who was coming to visit.

They don\u2019t have to cover up. Sports bras are fine. Get over it. \nTo the people claiming \u201c culture or religion,\u201d that only pertains to their own home.

I have a respect for my parents and my in-laws and I know how uncomfortable they would be if they walked in and saw me and (if I had a sister) in a sports bra. My in-laws are VERY religious. My dad and step dad I would never feel comfortable wearing anything like that around them because it\u2019s a bra not a shirt.", "NTA. He put on a shirt and he asked his guests to. It sounds like he wanted everybody to be dressed out of respect for his parents.\n\nIf my mom and dad were coming over, and my husband and I were exercising in the same outfits as OP and his GF, I would have us put shirts on. Not because I\u2019m ashamed, but because they are always dressed nice and presentable and it would make them more comfortable if we at least try to match their level of dress. It would be odd for my husband to be half naked while hanging out with my dad in his button up shirt and slacks. \n\nYeah it\u2019s a little more effort for me, but it makes them more comfortable. Conversely, if my husbands\u2019 parents were to come over, I wouldn\u2019t worry about it or change. They\u2019re just more laid-back shorts and sandals people. \n\nWe don\u2019t know OP\u2019s parents\u2019 background. Maybe they\u2019re 80 years old? His dad may have grown up during a time when they taught that it was disrespectful to women to view someone in that relative state of undress (relative to today\u2019s time). \n\nMaybe they\u2019re Muslim? If so, both his mom and his dad lead lives where they are purposeful not to expose themselves to other people\u2019s bodies out of respect to their religion. So he put on a shirt and he asked his guests to do the same.\n\nMaybe he was just trying to respect his parents and not every request to cover-up is an infringement on women\u2019s rights.", "I have big boobs, and id have put a shirt on right away. I dont like them out and about anyway though. Or id at least go to a different room. Had an exs parents see me with nothing on through a window and im still icked out by it", "It's understandable in the context of the gf and her sister having to deal with sexualization of their bodies throughout their lives, but it seems to me like they overreacted in this case. OP also put on a shirt; it wasn't like he told the women to cover up while remaining bare-chested himself. It wasn't about their particular bodies, just the fact that OP was raised to think people should wear shirts around their elders. I find it weird that he and his gf have been together two years and yet this became such a big deal. No discussion amongst the three of them like, \"Hey, what was that about? It felt ___.\" Just straight to \"you disrespected me so I won't teach you anymore.\" NAH, but yikes, it's like you don't all actually know each other.", "NTA, not even remotely.  I wonder if people on here can even read, or do they just zone in on one thing.  Regarding everyone lambasting him for \"didn't mean it that way,\" it is obvious what he meant when asking as he was doing it himself.  He put on a shirt too.  Maybe he sees that as general respect for his parents, maybe he sees is as general respect for guests, who knows, but it is completely obvious that it wasn't because he was sexualizing his gf and her sister or telling them to cover up because they are women.  Had he not put on a shirt, and requested this, then that would be one thing. But he put on a shirt too which clearly shows where his mind was.  Also, it is HIS house.  If he feels that it is respectful to have a shirt on for when his parent and/or unexpected guests are there, then that is something that he gets to decide. So NTA.  I don't even understand the rest of you. The gf and sister are the AHs here.\n\nEdit: Also, the OP even asking them to throw on a shirt implies that they wore a shirt on top of their sports bras to his house.", "YTA.

But not to ask them to do it. \n\nDid you think they were just comfortable hanging out with you in your underwear and didn\u2019t realize that plenty of people go out running or working out at the gym in front of God and everyone in just a sports bra?", "NAH, I get it. You feel awkward being shirtless in  front of your parents, and that awkwardness extends to other people being shirtless in front of tour parents. its pretty clear you didn't mean offense, but it is still wrong to tell people what to wear, and offense was still taken. Large chested women are told to cover up pretty constantly so im not surprised your request upset her. you should apologize, and then find find a different yoga teacher.", "YTA. \n\n> I told her I will clear things up with her sister but I will no apologize because I didn't mean it that way\n\nIt doesn't matter how you meant it. Impact matters more than intention. You said something that offended her, so you should definitely apologize.\n\nAlso, how else would you clear it up? Being stubborn won't get you anywhere.", "NTA. Honestly people act like you should never associate or compromise with anyone you have a single disagreement with. Yes, there are some cultures and older people who would find it disrespectful for people to be \"exposed\" when they arrive. They may not be right, but have you ever tried to change someone's mind about something like that? That argument is never worth the energy and this is not a hill to die on. Is he supposed to go NC with his parents because they have a few conservative beliefs?\n\nIt isn't blasphemous to tell someone to put on shirt because he wants to help her make a good impression on his parents.

They're realizing you've been sexualizing their workout outfits all along. \n\nThere are a growing number of places in the US where women are free to walk around in public with nothing on above the waist *at all,* just like men can, because court cases have deemed this double-standard to be sexist and discriminatory. If nipples are appropriate in public, then that goes for all nipples. Wearing sports bras they were already far more covered up than you were. In a private home, doing yoga.

They were probably hot. YTA", "don\u2019t get me wrong, i don\u2019t agree with OP but people on here don\u2019t stop to think about cultural nuances that are sometimes hard to break from. \n\nfor example: me and my wife come from a culture that\u2019s more on the conservative side when presenting ourselves in front of elders. we would never show ourselves shirtless or in minimal work out clothes in front of parents or in-laws or uncles/aunts, etc. i think this is a shared sensibility for a lot of households that have a custom of showing overt respect to elders.\n\nnow OP is totally the AH because he went about it all wrong and he is guilty of the same thing. he assumed his gf and sister shared the same view and didn\u2019t think of how his actions could have been perceived.", "His parents might care.", "Ah yes, the 'I can do whatever I want whenever I want, and you can't stop me!' attitude.\n\nTime, place and expected audience are a major factor in these sorts of situations.  Social contracts on expected clothing and skin coverage vary from place to place and context to context.  What is 100% acceptable or even encouraged in one place may be less so in others.  Sure, a lot of it is outdated convention, but it doesn't change the fact that a lot of people raised under different circumstances may have strong feelings about certain things, *especially* when they come across them suddenly.  \n\nNotice the word BRA that you used?  For a large proportion of the population, a bra is *underwear*; something that you don't generally wear exposed in front of people you don't know in most places.\n\nSure, OP's parents should be mature enough to accept that sports bras are everyday wear when exercising or hanging out in hot climates, but equally, it would have taken them moments to chuck on a T-Shirt and accept that OP's parents maybe just aren't used to that sort of thing as well.  It seems that wasn't about the size of her bust (as she assumed), it was about the item of clothing and amount of skin exposed to casual visitors.\n\nIf they'd all been practicing yoga butt-naked, what's your thoughts on who should cover up and how much then?  If the argument here was 'hey, an itsy-bitsy bikini is fine at the beach, so why can't I wear one to my job at the law firm', what would you say?  What about stripper nipple pasties to the opera?  At what distance from the beach do budgie smugglers (speedo's) change from acceptable beach wear to 'errr, he's walking around in his undies'?\n\nSocial contracts draw the line somewhere.  Often that line is in fact a nebulous range, and yes, this particular case does fall within the grey range where some people feel it's perfectly fine, and others don't.  It wouldn't have harmed the girls to chuck on a shirt for a little while so that OP could introduce his parents to them while they weren't standing around in their 'underwear'.  I'm sure OP's parents can learn to accept it given a bit of forewarning as well.

His weird behavior might be excusable if it was, but it's clear the sister was acting as a PT -- a professional, teaching a class -- in her own eyes and in the sister's eyes.  So the professional should have made it very clear to OP that she was acting in a professional capacity, and that the session should be treated with professional respect.  Maybe if the PT had made them sign a contract or something, made it clearer to OP that this wasn't a regular family gathering but an actual personal training session, OP wouldn't have treated her like a member of his prospective harem.

So, YTA for *that*.\n\nJust asking them to cover up, I don't think that was necessarily that much of an AH-move, especially as you also put on your shirt, but ultimatively whether they do cover up or not is up to them (being in workout-wear because you're working out at home isn't inappropriate IMO)", "YTA for not wanting to apologize. \n\nIf you were willing to apologize it would be N A H, if you apologized properly and she refused to accept it would he N T A\n\nI know that sounds like a lot of wiggle room but let me explain: this whole issue arose from a simple case of multiple people assuming things about others expectations.
