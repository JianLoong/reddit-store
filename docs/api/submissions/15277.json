They had a very hard time having children and last year had a baby boy. While SIL was pregnant she became a little insecure about names and being I was still in high school (a senior at the time) when my nephew was born, she wanted me to be brutally honest about my feelings on the names. My mom had already mentioned she might ask me and warned me not to be harsh because they were names she had collected over a long period of time and treasured and she was just overthinking things mostly. My brother also told me that he and Patricia really love those names and I should figure out a way not to comment on them. For like four months SIL asked me over and over for my comments on the list of names, wanted to know which one I thought would fit in best among his peers and which one would he like most. She said she loved vintage names and found all of them so handsome. Being totally honest I thought they were ugly and did a slight double take when I saw the list (Harold, Donald, Eugene, Stanley, Wilfred to name just a few of them) and I knew I couldn't say anything actually honestly positive about them so I told her she should follow her heart and discuss it with my brother every time she asked. I told her they didn't need a high school student having a say in baby names for them.\n\nNow SIL is expecting a baby girl. This time around she wants my opinion again and even brought up my name change (Beatrice to Winter) as a reason I should give my opinion because apparently my change was an odd one and something she felt was important to know about for her own kids. Then Sunday we were all at my parents and she brought it up again, wanting my opinion. My brother told her they didn't need my opinion and why did she need to keep bringing it up. She said I was the one closest in age to the kids and my input would be invaluable. He said my input was no more needed than the input of any other sibling. She ignored him and asked me again and said it was kind of mean to give no opinion because it would make her think I find them horrible or something. She then accused me of making fun of my nephew's name and of insulting her and my brother. I lost it. I yelled and told her to stop asking for my input because she would not like my actual honest thoughts and then it would hurt her feelings which I was trying to spare. I said we all knew how long she had collected the names and nobody thought I should be brutally honest. But she can't let it go and it was pissing me off. She was so upset. My brother told her I was right.

She said some pretty unfair things to me but I also know she's been a little erratic on the names and asked me so many times, so snapping at her might have been wrong when I never did give any idea of what I felt about them.

You told her to drop it. Your brother told her to drop it. She should have dropped it.", "NTA, you were very clear multiple times and she shouldn't have continued to press you, you reacted as anyone would.", "NTA. Your SIL sounds exhausting.", "NTA. Next time tell her to post her list of names on r/namenerds. If she wants opinions so bad she should get them from people who want to give them.", "NTA.  This sounds stressfully repetitive! Your SIL sounds obsessed by people\u2019s reactions to names.  I wonder what that is all about? IMO , if you worry about  the reaction to a name so much, don\u2019t use it.    Save yourself from that particular worry.  I find it a bit unusual you changed your own name, and honestly feel you might have more insight than others on the emotions of names.   Why can\u2019t you be honest and tell your real reaction?  I think she might really want to know.", "NTA, and the people who said Y T A cant read, you\u2019ve told her no on multiple occasions and someone point the 30+ YO should know that no means no and to stop asking.", "NTA\nShe badgered you over and over. Then your brother would also get involved. Frankly, this matter is between them, but your SIL insists on involving you. I don\u2019t blame you for finally losing it", "NTA.\nI almost went ESH because I do think the way you gave your \u201cnon-opinion\u201d could\u2019ve probably been handled better. Along with communicating kindly that you weren\u2019t going to engage in the conversation topic now, or in the future.\n\nBut honestly, this is a grown ass woman, who\u2019s almost middle-age, badgering a teenager. \n\nSo NTA wins out.", "ESH it really sounds like your brother let SIL continue doing this instead of directly addressing it with her. As for you, you were told by other parties to answer in a placating way, but a better avenue would have been to say from the start \"I'm not comfortable commenting on this because it's not my decision, please stop asking.\"", "ESH.  She should never have asked for an honest opinion if she didn\u2019t want an honest opinion.  However, this is also something you should know you never give an honest opinion on, either.\n\nFor future reference, someone asking if a baby name (for their own kid) is bad is kinda like someone asking, \u201cDoes this dress make me look fat?  Be honest.\u201d\n\nThe correct answer is always, always, \u201cNo.\u201d. No matter how often they beg or tell you that they really, really want your honest opinion.\n\nPro tip as someone who struggled with this for most of their life: just because someone says the want an honest opinion\u201490% of the time, they do not!  What they want is for you to reassure them that whatever they have already decided to do is okay.\n\nThat\u2019s just a basic social interaction thing, and the sooner you learn it, the better.  (I say this not in a chastising way, but in a \u201clearn from my mistakes\u201d way.)\n\nFor next time, in a similar situation, a correct response would be, \u201cI\u2019m sure anything you choose will be lovely.\u201d  You may express a preference if issued a group of choices.  In this case, with the baby names, you can something like, \u201cWell, I think I like Mary better than Bertha and Wanda.\u201d  But you may not say, \u201cBertha and Wanda are terrible names.\u201d\n\nEdited to add: I do think, on a certain level, you tried not to give an opinion.  That great!  But some of the other small details you mention\u2014like your SIL mentioning you made fun of your nephew\u2019s name indicate that you have made your opinion clear, whether you said it out loud or not.  You can say, \u201cThat\u2019s awful!\u201d without moving your lips.  (Unless of course, your SIL is delusional and making stuff up, but that\u2019s an entirely different conversation.)  Practice your poker face.  It\u2019s an invaluable life skill.", "NTA. It\u2019s good that somebody was finally straight with her.", "NTA. By the time their child is in school maybe having an old lady name will be cool. Your SIL nor you can predict what will be cool or not in the future. \n\nShe's probably insecure because your name was probably on her list and you chose to change it.", "NTA how many times was she going to poke the bear over this and not expect you to blow up", "NTA.  Everyone told her to drop it.  Everyone told you not to tell her the truth.  Everyone seems to be walking on eggshells for her, which she appears to want but also not want? IDEK.  You're not wrong.  She asked for the truth, she got it, and didn't want to hear it.  Too bad. Your parents are only telling you you went too far because you were the one left to talk to.", "YTA.  Not for being exasperated, but for yelling at her instead of just saying \"no, I'm done with this subject\" very firmly, and repeating it until she stops.\n\nPlease, someone get her some mental health help.  If not for her, for those babies.", "YTA.  You did go too far.  Girl, raising your voice is pretty much alllmost always the AH move.  \n\n\nDid you have a right to politely say \"I really would rather not be involved in such a personal decision for you and the more you ask me the less interested in I become - you will love your niece no matter what she is named and you are going to do great!\"  Then get up, and politely walk out.    \n\n\nBut your reaction was over the top, my dear.  :(", "I can't imagine a woman nearing 40 thinking a teenager's \"input would be invaluable\" for their baby's name. And pressing to the extent you're describing in this long tale. Whatever.\n\nYTA. There was no need for that response, except to be mean.", "ESH. She sounds obsessive about it and I feel like something else might be going on behind the scenes in their marriage (pure speculation, ignore me if I\u2019m wildly wrong) \nMeanwhile, it\u2019s not easy but it\u2019s an important skill to learn to put your point across firmly without losing your shit and insulting someone. I empathise with your reaction though, god knows I probably would have done the same sooner. But I know that makes me a bit of a ass.", "Just a little YTA. Of course she was annoying to continue to insist on your input on the names, but since she was so keen on knowing your opinion, you could have told her how you felt on a polite way instead of avoiding confrontation until you blew up.\nNot an AH for feeling uncomfortable, but the yelling situation could have been avoided if you had been honest with her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I even feel kind of bad for her still because I suspect she has some insecurity about being \"older\" when she had her kids and it taking so long. Maybe some trauma from it taking so long and being so difficult to have kids. But it has become exhausting.", "I preferred the nickname I was given by friends in school and used it the whole time anyway. Never really liked my original name so figured making the name I liked legal make sense. Especially since it has nothing to do with the name my parents gave me. My brother told me not to be honest about it. He probably knew the names they liked were not to my taste at all. I didn't want to crush her after it took her so long to have a baby.", "The flip side is if you are always brutally honest they eventually stop asking for your option. No one asks me unless they truly want an a option. \n\nI have come to realize and everyone around me has come to realize if I don\u2019t say it out loud my face will. So they no I am lying when I am trying not to hurt their feelings.", "She seems to think because I am younger, because I was in school still when they had my nephew, that I would have a better idea of whether names would be targeted or hated on. She does seem to be a worrier when it comes to motherhood so it could be insecurity on her part that she was \"older\" when she had kids.", "But SIL doesn\u2019t want her to be honest. She wants OP to like the names she likes and won\u2019t let it go. Enough is enough. OP is allowed to shut it down, being polite was getting her nowhere.", "You sound very straightforward.  I hope your niece and nephew are too.", "Or she's just trying to have something to talk about with you and her pregnancy is the topic at hand. I doubt you're as important in this as you seem to think you are.", "I don't think I'm important. We talk about plenty of other things but this is something she just would not let go.", "Idk, I can kind of see both sides here. I think she must felt she could trust you enough to ask for your input. It's your nephew and I guess sometimes your siblings other half just wants to get along with the family of the person they're dating or married to and feel like a part of the family. But I also think she should have respected the fact that you told her to drop it. But also sometimes constructive criticism can be good. I do understand that you may not have wanted to be rude outright, I wouldn't want to either. Sometimes an honest opinion is the most helpful", "NTA\n\nYour SIL wanted some honesty but unfortunately the truth hurts...", "NTA", "NTA.  I'd give SIL a pass due to hormones, but hearing the same questions over and over is exhausting.  You handled things great, don't worry about what family said.  We each get to name our kids - no one else needs to like the name.   She's very insecure.", "NTA. Especially since we all know \"I want your honest opinion\" in this context just means \"tell me you like what I picked\". You can't win having an opinion here.", "reminds me of when Will Smith laughed at the Chris Rock joke, only for his wife to glare daggers to the point where he ended up slapping him on stage.", "Conveniently overlooking the fact that OP has done exactly that with the previous nephew. Clearly, repetition isn't going to make SIL stop, since we're now onto the niece's name.", "YTA for yelling. You did go too far. Your feelings of annoyance were justified though. It might be helpful to think of this as an attempt to bond with you and show that she values your opinion. Apologize for the telling and ask that she stop requesting your input on names.

Why does she need her name choice validated by anyone?  It's ridiculous.", "Yeah.  Being a brutally honest person is just being a dick, but OP weaponized it for a specific reason in a specific situation for a specific result when she was basically out of options... hard to get mad about.", "I tried not to be honest.

She may be trying to get closer with OP, or sincerely be indecisive and want the input, but she needs to take the hint that OP isn't signing up for the task\n\n*  OP needs to find a way to refuse tactfully.  I think something happened between \"She ignored him and asked me again\" and \"She then accused me of making fun of my nephew's name\", which OP is eliding over.  \n\nThe brother appears to be the most level-headed person involved.\n\nMy recommendation to OP in future...  if SIL gives you a list of names, tell her the one you like best or dislike least.  Don't supply details... just that Winnifred or whatever \"sings to you\".", "NTA\n\nAnyway, her entire reasoning was flawed, because your peers are not going to be her child\u2019s peers.

Period, full stop. Baby names or otherwise. \n\nIf she\u2019s this insecure about her choices as a 30+ person and seeking validation from you because she is so worried about what the \u201cyoung and hip\u201d people are doing, she\u2019s going to have a tough time actually being a parent and making the unpopular decisions that parents need to make to ensure they don\u2019t raise tiny tyrants.", "It\u2019s her and her husband who have to pick the name. Buy her a baby name book to go through with her husband (not you). Point her to babycenter.com which is full of suggestions (and opinions). \n\nThe best advice i got for naming a baby was to stand at your front door and yell it out! (Or imagine doing so!). That narrows down the odd name choices pretty fast. \n\nAlso nicknames help. My mum wanted pretty girl names like Gabriela (not for me), but in retrospect, I\u2019d have loved Gabby."]}
