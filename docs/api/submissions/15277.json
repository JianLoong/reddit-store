They had a very hard time having children and last year had a baby boy. While SIL was pregnant she became a little insecure about names and being I was still in high school (a senior at the time) when my nephew was born, she wanted me to be brutally honest about my feelings on the names. My mom had already mentioned she might ask me and warned me not to be harsh because they were names she had collected over a long period of time and treasured and she was just overthinking things mostly. My brother also told me that he and Patricia really love those names and I should figure out a way not to comment on them. For like four months SIL asked me over and over for my comments on the list of names, wanted to know which one I thought would fit in best among his peers and which one would he like most. She said she loved vintage names and found all of them so handsome. Being totally honest I thought they were ugly and did a slight double take when I saw the list (Harold, Donald, Eugene, Stanley, Wilfred to name just a few of them) and I knew I couldn't say anything actually honestly positive about them so I told her she should follow her heart and discuss it with my brother every time she asked. I told her they didn't need a high school student having a say in baby names for them.\n\nNow SIL is expecting a baby girl. This time around she wants my opinion again and even brought up my name change (Beatrice to Winter) as a reason I should give my opinion because apparently my change was an odd one and something she felt was important to know about for her own kids. Then Sunday we were all at my parents and she brought it up again, wanting my opinion. My brother told her they didn't need my opinion and why did she need to keep bringing it up. She said I was the one closest in age to the kids and my input would be invaluable. He said my input was no more needed than the input of any other sibling. She ignored him and asked me again and said it was kind of mean to give no opinion because it would make her think I find them horrible or something. She then accused me of making fun of my nephew's name and of insulting her and my brother. I lost it. I yelled and told her to stop asking for my input because she would not like my actual honest thoughts and then it would hurt her feelings which I was trying to spare. I said we all knew how long she had collected the names and nobody thought I should be brutally honest. But she can't let it go and it was pissing me off. She was so upset. My brother told her I was right.

She said some pretty unfair things to me but I also know she's been a little erratic on the names and asked me so many times, so snapping at her might have been wrong when I never did give any idea of what I felt about them. It feels like she might be overthinking things because it took her so long to have kids and maybe I was overly mean about it with her.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

NTA because she kept on pushing it and accusing you of making fun of your nephew's name because she knew she was wrong and you tried being nice but she wanted honesty and she got it.", "NTA. \n\nNo one wants to be badgered for YEARS about something that doesn't concern them.\n\nYour sil... damn.", "NTA. You told her to drop it. Your brother told her to drop it. She should have dropped it.", "NTA, you were very clear multiple times and she shouldn't have continued to press you, you reacted as anyone would.", "NTA. Your SIL sounds exhausting.", "NTA. Next time tell her to post her list of names on r/namenerds. If she wants opinions so bad she should get them from people who want to give them.", "NTA.  This sounds stressfully repetitive! Your SIL sounds obsessed by people\u2019s reactions to names.  I wonder what that is all about? IMO , if you worry about  the reaction to a name so much, don\u2019t use it.    Save yourself from that particular worry.  I find it a bit unusual you changed your own name, and honestly feel you might have more insight than others on the emotions of names.   Why can\u2019t you be honest and tell your real reaction?  I think she might really want to know.", "NTA, and the people who said Y T A cant read, you\u2019ve told her no on multiple occasions and someone point the 30+ YO should know that no means no and to stop asking.", "NTA\nShe badgered you over and over. Then your brother would also get involved. Frankly, this matter is between them, but your SIL insists on involving you. I don\u2019t blame you for finally losing it", "NTA.\nI almost went ESH because I do think the way you gave your \u201cnon-opinion\u201d could\u2019ve probably been handled better. Along with communicating kindly that you weren\u2019t going to engage in the conversation topic now, or in the future.\n\nBut honestly, this is a grown ass woman, who\u2019s almost middle-age, badgering a teenager. \n\nSo NTA wins out.", "ESH it really sounds like your brother let SIL continue doing this instead of directly addressing it with her. As for you, you were told by other parties to answer in a placating way, but a better avenue would have been to say from the start \"I'm not comfortable commenting on this because it's not my decision, please stop asking.\"", "ESH.  She should never have asked for an honest opinion if she didn\u2019t want an honest opinion.  However, this is also something you should know you never give an honest opinion on, either.\n\nFor future reference, someone asking if a baby name (for their own kid) is bad is kinda like someone asking, \u201cDoes this dress make me look fat?  Be honest.\u201d\n\nThe correct answer is always, always, \u201cNo.\u201d. No matter how often they beg or tell you that they really, really want your honest opinion.\n\nPro tip as someone who struggled with this for most of their life: just because someone says the want an honest opinion\u201490% of the time, they do not!  What they want is for you to reassure them that whatever they have already decided to do is okay.\n\nThat\u2019s just a basic social interaction thing, and the sooner you learn it, the better.  (I say this not in a chastising way, but in a \u201clearn from my mistakes\u201d way.)\n\nFor next time, in a similar situation, a correct response would be, \u201cI\u2019m sure anything you choose will be lovely.\u201d  You may express a preference if issued a group of choices.  In this case, with the baby names, you can something like, \u201cWell, I think I like Mary better than Bertha and Wanda.\u201d  But you may not say, \u201cBertha and Wanda are terrible names.\u201d\n\nEdited to add: I do think, on a certain level, you tried not to give an opinion.  That great!  But some of the other small details you mention\u2014like your SIL mentioning you made fun of your nephew\u2019s name indicate that you have made your opinion clear, whether you said it out loud or not.  You can say, \u201cThat\u2019s awful!\u201d without moving your lips.  (Unless of course, your SIL is delusional and making stuff up, but that\u2019s an entirely different conversation.)  Practice your poker face.  It\u2019s an invaluable life skill.", "NTA. It\u2019s good that somebody was finally straight with her.", "NTA. By the time their child is in school maybe having an old lady name will be cool. Your SIL nor you can predict what will be cool or not in the future. \n\nShe's probably insecure because your name was probably on her list and you chose to change it.", "NTA how many times was she going to poke the bear over this and not expect you to blow up", "NTA.  Everyone told her to drop it.  Everyone told you not to tell her the truth.  Everyone seems to be walking on eggshells for her, which she appears to want but also not want? IDEK.  You're not wrong.  She asked for the truth, she got it, and didn't want to hear it.  Too bad. Your parents are only telling you you went too far because you were the one left to talk to.", "YTA.  Not for being exasperated, but for yelling at her instead of just saying \"no, I'm done with this subject\" very firmly, and repeating it until she stops.\n\nPlease, someone get her some mental health help.  If not for her, for those babies.", "YTA.  You did go too far.  Girl, raising your voice is pretty much alllmost always the AH move.  \n\n\nDid you have a right to politely say \"I really would rather not be involved in such a personal decision for you and the more you ask me the less interested in I become - you will love your niece no matter what she is named and you are going to do great!\"  Then get up, and politely walk out.    \n\n\nBut your reaction was over the top, my dear.  :(", "I can't imagine a woman nearing 40 thinking a teenager's \"input would be invaluable\" for their baby's name. And pressing to the extent you're describing in this long tale. Whatever.\n\nYTA. There was no need for that response, except to be mean.", "ESH. She sounds obsessive about it and I feel like something else might be going on behind the scenes in their marriage (pure speculation, ignore me if I\u2019m wildly wrong) \nMeanwhile, it\u2019s not easy but it\u2019s an important skill to learn to put your point across firmly without losing your shit and insulting someone. I empathise with your reaction though, god knows I probably would have done the same sooner. But I know that makes me a bit of a ass.", "Just a little YTA. Of course she was annoying to continue to insist on your input on the names, but since she was so keen on knowing your opinion, you could have told her how you felt on a polite way instead of avoiding confrontation until you blew up.\nNot an AH for feeling uncomfortable, but the yelling situation could have been avoided if you had been honest with her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe some trauma from it taking so long and being so difficult to have kids.

Never really liked my original name so figured making the name I liked legal make sense. Especially since it has nothing to do with the name my parents gave me.
