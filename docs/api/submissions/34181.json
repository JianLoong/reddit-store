My sisters maybe aren't wrong when they say I let Ana live in a bubble but is it so bad that I want to always be a safety net for my niece? I never intended for Ana to go distant from other family members but I never discouraged her favouring of me either.", ">Ana is an adult and is allowed to pick who she feels comfortable and safe with\n\nI think more focus needs to be on this. She can pick whoever she wants to walk her down the aisle. Whether its an uncle she's close with, her best friend (male or female), a dog, or walking herself down the aisle. No one is entitled to walk her down the aisle. As an adult, she gets to decide who (if anyone) she wants to be involved.", "She stayed with me for 2 months during the divorce filings and proceedings. She went back to her dad's house after the funeral. Within 6 months she came back to my house because my brother said she was being hurtful and aggressive to his pregnant wife.", "NTA", ">I probably spoiled Ana by being \"in her team\" so to speak. I just hoped she would see me as her safety net and not go down a wrong path. I can't say it was the healthiest thing to do though.\n\nMaybe you did, maybe you didn't. It's hard for us to accurately judge this. However, I sincerely doubt that this issue here is where you need to draw the line and stop 'spoiling' her. It's *her* wedding.", "\u201cI did then what I knew how to do, now that I know better I do better\u201d (or something to that effect) by Maya Angelou.\n\nThe only thing I would personally do, though I\u2019m not you and don\u2019t know the ends and outs of your life so take it with a grain of salt, is sit down with Ana and say first that you\u2019ll be happy to walk her down the isle. That she\u2019s your kid and you\u2019ll do whatever she feels is best for her but you also want her to consider how she wants the rest of her life to look and that this might be the thing she can never come back from. She could have kids, you could sadly perish and if she is fine with having nobody else then that\u2019s her choice. Ask maybe if she would consider talking it out with a therapist.\n\nI only say all of that because I don\u2019t ever want her to live a life with regrets, not that we don\u2019t have them but we should make sure we make choices for ourselves at the time we make them that we feel it\u2019s best for ourself and our future.\n\nThat\u2019s all, dad you\u2019re NTA. Neither is Ana.", "Ana has every right to be angry with her father. No amount of therapy is going to change that. He cheated on Ana's mother and indirectly caused her death. I don't know whether it is right or wrong but I believe Ana shouldn't be expected to connect with her half siblings. \n\nThat being said I don't fault your brother for not putting his other children back to spend time with Ana. I don't believe that could have helped and is really unfair to his other children. Who were also innocent in this. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with you prioritising her. She has only you in her life. And her late mother trusted her with you even though you were her cheating husband's brother. But you should have/will have to explain to her that spending time with your sister's children in no way is ignoring her. That could be helped with therapy. Also while she can opt to not have a relationship with her half siblings. She shouldn't expect you or the rest of the family to ignore them. \n\nI don't blame your family for not going NC with other children. But here they are wrong. There is no version of this where your brother walks Ana down the aisle. Maybe they can bully you to not walk her, but then what? She is not going to let her bio dad walk her down the aisle. The family are being unreasonable AH's here trying to get you to not go along with this. \n\nSo don't listen to the family. Don't have second thoughts and be there for Ana.", "you did let her live in a bubble, ana should have never been involved in the cheating. she also should not have dictates that you can\u2019t spend time with other kids", "Thing is, he didn\u2019t have other kids until after Ana\u2019s mom died. He could have chosen to work on his relationship with his daughter, especially after losing her mom so traumatically. But he didn\u2019t.", "Sorry but Ana's father did not \"indirectly\" put her mother into a position to drive while drunk, those were her mother's adult choices.", "We need confirmation from OP but I think the affair partner was pregnant by the time Ana's mother died. He mentioned in another comment that brother left Ana with him deeming her dangerous to his then pregnant wife.", "Ok let's see\n\n1) He cheated on her with some other woman and destroyed the marriage \n\n2) Left her in financial ruin. \n\n3) Had to give up her daughter. \n\n4) Was In the middle of a very messy divorse. \n\nSure she made an adult choice to get drunk and drive. But it was also on OP's brother for driving her until that point. It was his actions that indirectly led to that moment."]}
