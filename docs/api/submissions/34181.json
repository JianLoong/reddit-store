I can\u2019t even begin to imagine how Ana must have felt and still feels because of your brother\u2019s gross behavior. \n1. Your brother destroyed \u201cThe Happy Home\u201d by having an affair. \n2. Ana lost her mother well before exSIL died\u2026due to the poor financial state and obviously poor mental state the divorce (your brother caused) left exSIL in. The evidence of this is you took custody of Ana for 2 months, the first time. \n3. Your brother had a choice\u2026prioritize his 9yr old daughter, who just lost her happy home and mother, or only think of himself. Your brother chose to move in his AP and knock her up. Sorry but that screams to an already traumatized 9 yr old mind \u201cYOU DON\u2019T MATTER TO ME. I DON\u2019T LOVE YOU. I WANT A NEW FAMILY\u201d\n4. Ana was acting aggressively towards a woman that helped destroy her life and was pregnant with \u201cthe replacement child.\u201d Instead of your brother seeking individual therapy and family therapy for Ana he dumped her off with you. Don\u2019t get me wrong you\u2019re AWESOME. Ana needed you but your brother moving Ana out of his home and into yours just reinforced Ana\u2019s feelings of inadequacy and being unimportant and unloved by her only living parent. You were the person that got Ana into therapy!!!! \n5. Your brother had the opportunity throughout Ana\u2019s life to spend individual quality time with her. Once again He chose his current family over Ana. I get the impression it was \u201cspend time with me , the AP, and our children or don\u2019t spend any time with me at all\u201d \n6. Yes Ana\u2019s half siblings are innocent and should not be punished for your brother\u2019s and his AP\u2019s actions but your brother got your entire family (minus you) to once again choose him and \u201chis\u201d over Ana. Your family could have very easily respected Ana\u2019s boundaries by spending individual time with her. By \u201cnot wanting to get in the middle\u201d, by \u201cnot choosing,\u201d your family ultimately chose\u2026and it wasn\u2019t Ana. Goodness, your family didn\u2019t even invite her to the family holiday\u2026YOU DID. \n7. Currently your brother is choosing himself and everyone else over Ana by riling the entire family against you and Ana. Why? Because you have always prioritized Ana. Ana recognized that and wants to honor you by having you walk her down the aisle. You\u2019re not \u201cthe fun uncle\u201d you\u2019re Ana\u2019s dad. \n\nPaying expenses for a child doesn\u2019t make a person a parent.  It was quite literally the minimum your brother could do. Not to mention it was your brother\u2019s legal obligation. \n\nListen, it was unhealthy for Ana to be jealous of you spending time with your other nieces and nephews but look at it from her point of view. Can you imagine the fear she must have had of losing you? It may have been an irrational fear but again she was a child and you were the only constant in her life that ALWAYS put her first. \n\nOh and as an afterthought\u2026 Ana not really answering much about the wedding and refusing money from your brother wasn\u2019t petty. It was Ana setting boundaries. You give the impression Ana wasn\u2019t rude just adamant with her decision and gave a valid reason why without attacking anyone. You specifically stated \u201cAna simply said\u2026\u201d I assume the arguments were your family attacking Ana for her decision and you for accepting. Leaving before anyone wakes up is usually a decision made to avoid conflict and heartbreak. \nYour family saying congratulations should have ended the discussion. Anything else on your family\u2019s part was gauche. If Ana wanted your family to know and be a part of her wedding she would have invited them and volunteered any and all information without being prodded. \n\nThe audacity of your brother and family is astounding. Who knowingly wants a cheater at a wedding let alone to walk them down the aisle? That\u2019s just bad juju. \n\nAfter everything Ana\u2019s been through in her life she\u2019s well adjusted enough to go to college and choosing to get married. Congrats OP on raising a young woman who knows her self worth, refuses to hide her opinions, and has enough inner strength to stick with her decisions instead of making everyone else happy. \n\nSide note: I feel like there is more going on between AP and Ana than Ana hating AP for cheating with Ana\u2019s dad.\n\nEdited for grammar/formatting", "Only two questions need to be answered here.\n\n1.

Any act that prioritizes your brother's feelings over hers will be treated with disgust in her eyes.\n\nYour brother cheated on her now dead mother, he will always be a cheater to her, his wife and children will always be a testament to that.

He betrayed his wife, he betrayed Ana, he destroyed their family, and now Ana's mother is gone forever.\n\nInstead of respecting his child, instead of allowing her time to process and grieve, instead of doing anything at all to recognize what she was going through and try to help her... Instead of *being* her *father*, he had the audacity to continue his relationship. He then moved this woman, his mistress, this stranger who ruined Ana's life, into her MOTHER'S HOUSE a month after she died.\n\nAnd then... When he was ready to move on with his shiny new family, and Ana wasn't (because why should she be?)... When she became too difficult for him? He threw her away. He pawned her off on someone else. It doesn't matter what he paid for - being financially responsible is the bare minimum after you put a child on this planet, you don't get points for that. What matters is being there emotionally. Even when it's hard, even when they don't want you. He checked out on being a parent. He gave up.\n\nAna doesn't want him to walk her down the aisle, doesn't want him to \"give her away\", because he already *did*. He gave her away to *you*. And you stepped up. You took care of her the way that she needed, the way that *mattered.* You were much more than a fun uncle. You were there for her. I mean, hell, he's not even the one who got her into therapy! Of course she's picking you! You're the only stable parent she's had!\n\nShe's still furious with him. She's justified. He has made choice after choice that has hurt her over and over. And now he expects a place of honor - honor that he didn't earn - on one of the happiest and most important days of her life? And it's \"hurtful\" to him that she's not giving him that?! What about how hurtful it was to his late ex to get cheated on? What about how hurtful it was for Ana to see him move on so quickly? What about how hurtful it was for him to choose his new wife's comfort over his daughter's? Did he ever for one second think about that?\n\nUltimately, her wedding has nothing to do with him. She's not even letting him pay for it. Her choices on her wedding day have nothing to do with him, and nothing to do with his feelings. He's certainly never considered hers.  His wishes are irrelevant, and they became so the second he stepped out on his family. She has washed her hands of him. This is not about him. It's not between Ana and her father. It's between Ana and you. You would not be in the wrong for ignoring him and honoring her.\n\nHe's gonna be a dick about it, though. He's gonna whine about his feelings being hurt, he's gonna cry about being disrespected, he's gonna throw a fit about how he should get to do it because he's her father, blah blah blah.

So much so, that the reason she doesn\u2019t deal with the rest of the family is because she essentially tried to make them choose between her and the relationship with the new siblings. She even did that to her dad, which is also unfair to the children who did not ask for any of this. \n\nAna needed therapy a long long time ago.

Would her mother have been sober, or so careless of her life to drive drunk, if she hadn\u2019t been cheated on? Even if the answer was yes, Ana is not going to see it that way. If her mother were still alive, it\u2019s possible she could have eventually reconciled with him, but I don\u2019t see it in the cards, whether or not you walk her down the aisle. Actions have consequences, long after the initial events. I can see why the rest of the family eventually got used to having his second wife around, but Ana is a different person with different pain, and trying to get her to let her dad walk her down the aisle would only harm your relationship with her as it would imply you don\u2019t understand where she\u2019s coming from. \n\nAnd don\u2019t discount the role you played for her.
