{"id": 9451, "submission_id": "10wwrd1", "title": "AITA for making my wedding dog free?", "selftext": "While I don't think it's a big deal, I feel it may be asked. So I will state first and foremost that I have never liked dogs and especially dog nutters. I'm not talking about dog lovers. I'm talking about the individuals who would spit in a kids face for looking at their animal because they are \"such a protective mama/papa bear to their fur babies\". This seems judgemental and perhaps it is. But added to the context, what I mentioned above describes a good 70% of my family and my fiances family combined. Most are kid free but treat their dogs like royalty in a sense of treating everyone else like shit. I was excluded a lot until I was over the age of 18 simply because they prefer dogs to children and were vocal and rude about it. I couldn't even go to a family event as a child without being overlooked by most adults. Multiple gifts being handed out to the dogs, as well as hundreds of photos taken of them, when I got maybe 1 to 2 things and no photos. So no, I don't like dogs and I don't like those kind of people. BUT as I've gotten older I actually get along really well with a lot of the individuals who hated me as a child despite me being a quiet kid who stuck to myself.\n\nAnywho, all of our recent family weddings have been strictly kid free. I have no problems with what they want to do with their weddings. But I have 3 siblings, all of which have 2 kids under the age of 7. I also have a few cousins and collectively have 8 kids under the age of 11. With all of the other adults, they have about 10 dogs combined, I believe, and bring them everywhere because the whole family allows it. But my fiance and I talked and he is very respectful of the fact that I do not want dogs at my wedding but I DO want the kids there. I want them all to be included as little ring bearers and flower girls. All of them, which is completely out of the norm and a bit chaotic but they don't get included in anything and I think it will be a blast for them. \n\nSo I sent out the invites that specifically said no dogs are allowed under any circumstances. Not even your emotional support dogs- which a few people in the family have claimed their dogs are (for no other reason other than \"they give me a happy boost so they are my emotional support baby\"- no other ailments). A lot of calls and texts were sent to me in regards to this and a few were down right angry, stating that I am being ridiculous because their dogs are their kids and if I didn't want to include them then I shouldn't be allowing children either because they are \"much more chaotic than our precious fur baby\". I politely said that if they didn't like it they didn't have to attend. The kid bearing family members are ecstatic but a lot of the others have declined the invite- which upsets my fiance because this means his brother, sister and father won't be attending. But I'm standing my ground. AITA?\n\nETA: I did make one single exception for my grandfather because he has a service dog who monitors his seizures but he is the only dog allowed.\n\nAlso, my fiance's father doesn't have a dog himself. He refuses to attend the wedding because my fiance's sister went and cried to him for us not allowing her to bring her two Chihuahuas. His sister is 28 years old and has her father wrapped around her finger and still throws tantrums to get her way. So my future FIL has stated that he won't attend until we make an exception for my future SIL. It's a power trip and manipulation at best. But no, my fiance isn't upset with me. He's upset that his father is making his big day all about his childish sister.", "created_utc": 1675863090, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10wwrd1/aita_for_making_my_wedding_dog_free/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We haven't moved any of our stuff in yet, as we plan to decorate the entire ground floor (large space) and have my fiance and I set up in front of the large open doors that overlook the lake. So it's at me and my fiances new home.", "My fiance's brother and sister both have 2 dogs. His sister has two tea cup Chihuahuas (not sure if that's actually their breed but that's what she calls them) and she has declined because they get anxious if she leaves the house without them and she says she's \"not willing to put her children through emotional distress\". The brother won't attend because his 2 dogs can't go. He's a big German Shepherd and the other is a Boxer and neither are very well trained. They jump on everyone. My fiance's father won't attend because the sister cried about it to him and he is insanely over protective of his daughter. So he is just on a power trip and trying to stand firm on it, trying to get my fiance and I to change our minds. He has said \"When you let my daughter have her dogs there, we will go.\" I do want to point out as well that the sister is 28 years old. She's not some crying child.", "If OP is in the US, there\u2019s no actual certification for ESAs or service dogs, so if they\u2019re waving something like that around, then it\u2019s clearly something that they bought online and has no real standing. To show how garbage they are, someone registered a jar of Nutella a few years back. \n\nOP, NTA and I say that as a service dog handler who wouldn\u2019t even consider bringing my SD to a private function without checking with the host.", "I mean it seems like for events, like Christmas, where gift giving is expected people would give OP next to nothing while showering the dogs with gifts. Thats pretty messed up to do to a kid.", "WTF it's not IN ANY WAY NORMAL TO BRING PET TO WEDDINGS! What is this", "All I got from your comment is that you are exactly like the people I am referring to and can't stomach the fact that people have boundaries that don't fit your lifestyle. None of the \"emotional support dogs\" are registered for emotional support. I did partly mention this in my post. I also stated that there has been an exception for a legitimate service animal that is needed for the health and well being of the individual I'm making the exception for. The future FIL doesn't even have a dog himself. He is on a power trip and won't go because his daughter, who he treats better than his son's, cried to him for not being able to bring her two Chihuahuas. Also, if you skipped over another detail, my fiance is backing me on this. He is simply hurt that his own father would once again choose a crying 28yo girl who still throws tantrums to get her way over him.", "It\u2019s HER wedding, not the family\u2019s.  Her decision isn\u2019t preventing anyone from coming.  Her in laws have decided to forgo the wedding because their dog\u2019s feelings are more important than the human connection of attending the wedding.  \n\nI love my dogs, but people who value their pets over an important human interaction (wedding) are not well adjusted individuals. They\u2019re as selfish as those who insist on bringing children to a no kids wedding.", "101 Dalmatians wedding?", "You should contact the screenwriters of \u201cBest in Show\u201d. Plenty of ideas here for a follow-up movie!", "If they let the dogs snack on anything then they don't even sound like good owners", "Planning to have your own dog in your wedding is one thing, explicitly throwing a dog friendly wedding would be another, but assuming your pet would be welcome at just any wedding is not normal. \"Don't bring your pets\" is so much the norm most people don't even feel the need to state it.", "If I were a professional venue, I would bar dogs on the basis of liability risk. If someone is bitten, they will sue everyone in sight, especially those with property that can have a lien attached.", "If you don\u2019t stand your ground now, expect all future events including at your home to center around dogs.", "I have a feeling Op is exaggerating lol", "It does suck his father won\u2019t be there and that he\u2019s backing his daughter. But at least you have your fianc\u00e9es support. He may regret not having him there but it is what it is. I get that her dogs get anxious but why couldn\u2019t they stay somewhere for a short amount of time? Even anxious dogs can do an hour or two away from their owner. In the end this decision will prevent people from going. And you have a vendetta against dogs. So that is why I voted the way I did.\n\nBut maybe go to therapy for your hatred of animals and why it makes you so angry.", "It\u2019s just your wedding when you elope, unfortunately when you invite guests you\u2019re including everyone on your day and you have to accommodate for them, they are your *guests*. For some reason people go rogue and set down rules and get all mad about it when there are issues. It is hardly ever just your day and it\u2019s never just about you. I think that\u2019s a romantic naive idea these days.", "I have a feeling you are one of the relatives", "Wow, you really have a weird take on this. Just wow.", "She obviously doesn't hate the dogs but the assholes that come with them", "Hey I want to bring my emotional support Belarussian wrestling team to your wedding, please accomodate"]}
