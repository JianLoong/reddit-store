{"id": 9451, "submission_id": "10wwrd1", "title": "AITA for making my wedding dog free?", "selftext": "While I don't think it's a big deal, I feel it may be asked. So I will state first and foremost that I have never liked dogs and especially dog nutters. I'm not talking about dog lovers. I'm talking about the individuals who would spit in a kids face for looking at their animal because they are \"such a protective mama/papa bear to their fur babies\". This seems judgemental and perhaps it is. But added to the context, what I mentioned above describes a good 70% of my family and my fiances family combined. Most are kid free but treat their dogs like royalty in a sense of treating everyone else like shit. I was excluded a lot until I was over the age of 18 simply because they prefer dogs to children and were vocal and rude about it. I couldn't even go to a family event as a child without being overlooked by most adults. Multiple gifts being handed out to the dogs, as well as hundreds of photos taken of them, when I got maybe 1 to 2 things and no photos. So no, I don't like dogs and I don't like those kind of people. BUT as I've gotten older I actually get along really well with a lot of the individuals who hated me as a child despite me being a quiet kid who stuck to myself.\n\nAnywho, all of our recent family weddings have been strictly kid free. I have no problems with what they want to do with their weddings. But I have 3 siblings, all of which have 2 kids under the age of 7. I also have a few cousins and collectively have 8 kids under the age of 11. With all of the other adults, they have about 10 dogs combined, I believe, and bring them everywhere because the whole family allows it. But my fiance and I talked and he is very respectful of the fact that I do not want dogs at my wedding but I DO want the kids there. I want them all to be included as little ring bearers and flower girls. All of them, which is completely out of the norm and a bit chaotic but they don't get included in anything and I think it will be a blast for them. \n\nSo I sent out the invites that specifically said no dogs are allowed under any circumstances. Not even your emotional support dogs- which a few people in the family have claimed their dogs are (for no other reason other than \"they give me a happy boost so they are my emotional support baby\"- no other ailments). A lot of calls and texts were sent to me in regards to this and a few were down right angry, stating that I am being ridiculous because their dogs are their kids and if I didn't want to include them then I shouldn't be allowing children either because they are \"much more chaotic than our precious fur baby\". I politely said that if they didn't like it they didn't have to attend. The kid bearing family members are ecstatic but a lot of the others have declined the invite- which upsets my fiance because this means his brother, sister and father won't be attending. But I'm standing my ground. AITA?\n\nETA: I did make one single exception for my grandfather because he has a service dog who monitors his seizures but he is the only dog allowed.\n\nAlso, my fiance's father doesn't have a dog himself. He refuses to attend the wedding because my fiance's sister went and cried to him for us not allowing her to bring her two Chihuahuas. His sister is 28 years old and has her father wrapped around her finger and still throws tantrums to get her way. So my future FIL has stated that he won't attend until we make an exception for my future SIL. It's a power trip and manipulation at best. But no, my fiance isn't upset with me. He's upset that his father is making his big day all about his childish sister.", "created_utc": 1675863090, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10wwrd1/aita_for_making_my_wedding_dog_free/", "score": 1473, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
