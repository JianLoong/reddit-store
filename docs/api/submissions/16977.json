They definitely do not starve and their weight is in the 98 percentile. This is just a little insight, so you guys understand that I don\u2019t starve these children. I just left the hospital with a very rare condition and that condition has caused anorexia. I haven\u2019t been able to eat as much. I went to whole days with just water and realized I had to eat something or I was going to pass out. To give you guys a little insight on my weight I weigh almost 80 pounds now. So I got up and made the kiddos breakfast. I fed them and gave them their juice and they get a little snack not too long after. But when I made my food, my child demanded I share. I couldn\u2019t take it. It was my first meal, and it felt like it was forever that I have eaten. I got up and walked away with my food and ate while my child sat there and screamed for me to feed them my food. I have guilt because I don\u2019t want to ever tell my child no when it comes to food. However, I have to eat and being this size is not healthy. But listening to my child cry filled me up with a lot of guilt. Should I have just shared with them or gave it to them and made myself something else? Or did I do the right thing by walking away and actually eating a meal for once in the past two days?", "created_utc": 1683819190, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13eqryk/aita_for_not_sharing_food_with_my_child/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't have kids either, but think you have nothing to feel guilty about. Even though it may make you uncomfortable to say no to them regarding food, it is a common thing for parents to say no about and have boundaries on. You made them breakfast and a snack, so they were not hungry. Kids like to imitate mom and dad, and maybe your kid wanted to share only because it was yours and not because of the food itself, because I used to do that as a kid to feel connected and get attention. They cried because they were disappointed, not hungry. But don't feel bad about that either. Kids face disappointment just like we do, but they move on a lot faster. I don't think this instance is damaging in the slightest and any disappointment will be forgotten quickly. It's important for you to take care of yourself and give your body the fuel it needs to be present with the kiddos. Maybe if your kids are old enough, you can sit them down and explain that you haven't been feeling well lately, so it's extra important that you eat everything on your plate to help your body heal because you want to be the healthiest, best mom you can be. I like to think kids of any age can understand and (hopefully) respect that. I hope you keep focusing on your needs, you deserve love too.
