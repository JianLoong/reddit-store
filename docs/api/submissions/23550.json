OK. There's a lot to unpack here. \n\nFirst of all, MIL is way out of line. Your body, your pregnancy,  YOUR uterus in the scan - your choice. Bodily consent goes so much further than people realise and absolutely includes everything to do with pregnancy.\n\nAlso, it's such a boomer thing to insist on everything going on social. I had this battle with my (now estranged) mother too. She whinged about it but she did actually follow our wishes.\n\nSecondly, your partner needs to decide who he's having a baby with - you, or his mother. Believe me, if he's more worried about mummy than his wife, that's a massive issue that will only get worse. \n\nNows the time to work on clear boundaries ( a boundary isn't trying to control someone else, it's deciding what you will and won't tolerate and then following through with consequences if your boundaries are crossed) and have some possibly uncomfortable talks with SO. He needs to get his priorities right.\n\nSo. No more photos for MIL if she can't be trusted (it's like a toddler yeah? 'If you can't keep these images off social then we can't let you have them at all'), and some very real talks with SO.\n\nOtherwise the next argument will be over them barging into the birthing suite while you're still being put back together because 'they were just so excited'.\n\nEdit: A word", "NTA but don\u2019t share your scan photo with your mother in law. She\u2019s proven to want to override you. \n\nWhat I\u2019m also seeing is you\u2019ve got the beginnings of a partner problem. He can disagree with you (it\u2019s his news too) but calling you selfish? Oh no. Nope this needs to be talked about. Because you have the birth coming up and it sounds like she\u2019ll want to insinuate herself in that.\n\nThat said just tell your friends via sms. There are going to be some friends you just won\u2019t see in person, let go of the perfect announcement. Just make it public in one hit.", "NTA, but seems like your husband is TA\nYour MIL treats you like you\u2019re just an incubator for HER grandchild. Notice how I didn\u2019t say \u201cyour child\u201d instead? Because she doesn\u2019t even percept this child as yours. I would also advise you to stay very cautious about her involvement in your family\u2019s life. I say it with 99.9% confidence that she will become very annoying once the baby is born and try to cross your boundaries while you\u2019re still weak and recovering. Do not let that happen. Ideally, you would want to get full support from your husband, but I don\u2019t know if this is possible. Remember, this is your and your husband\u2019s child only and only you can make decisions in this regard including posting or not posting any images or sharing information.", "NTA.  Fuck what is wrong with some people?  Your news, your timeline.", "NTA. It's your pregnancy. Of course she is excited and she can be. I'm sure it's great to become a grandmother for the first time.

Don\u2019t give her the scan photo until you are ready to announce it yourself", "Thanks everyone, unfortunately my partner seems to think his mother does no wrong and is always justifying her actions and behaviour. I\u2019m really not sure how to overcome this, we have spoke about it multiple times however he always seems to take his mums side and never believes she is in the wrong. She is very manipulative and I believe this plays a huge role but he just can\u2019t see that. If I had his full support on the matter it would make it so much easier, I have tried reasoning with him and explaining that my parents don\u2019t act like that but he just says that\u2019s because my parents don\u2019t care, which is not true in the slightest. The pregnancy was an accident, we have been together since high school - 8 years this year, however since we moved in together 5 months ago we have had many issues, I have always wanted children but since these issues started I wanted to wait a while so I knew it was the right thing to do, however like I said it happened by accident so I had no choice really", "NTA but it sounds like you have a husband and a MIL problem now. You need to nip this in the butt now or it will only be worse when the baby comes.

I don\u2019t think you should do this as this should be a moment shared between mother and father. I think u should just request that the MIL patiently waits outside as she should not be involved in this scan whatsoever especially if her only reason is just to post it on Snapchat.", "NTA but your partner is (and your MIL too obviously). He should be on your side and should tell his mother to calm the heck down if she wants to be allowed in her grandkid's life.\n\nYou're the one who's pregnant. You can not allow her in the scan room - technically you can decide who you want with you and you can even tell your partner he's not allowed if you think he'll take pics to give them to his mom, which would be a shitty thing to do.\n\nYou have clear boundaries and she's overstepping them on purpose because she wants to be the one in charge. She harassed you until you went along with what she wanted - both for the house and for announcing your pregnancy earlier that you wanted to. It's time to have a very firm conversation with your partner and his mother to let them both know that you won't take this crap anymore and if she try one more thing she'll be banned from seeing your kid since you can't trust her - and you can't trust your partner who's taking his mom's side when he should take his partner's side.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sounds like the MIL from hell, and OP's husband should take her side, not his mother's.", "NTA.\n\nYou need to make it clear to MIL that there will be no social media photos of your child. And if she posts them, no more photos. \n\nHell, even Mark Zuckerberg puts emoji over his kids' faces.\n\nTell MIL that you do not want to give these social media companies a head start on your child's identifying details. And tell her that you don't want to deal with a teenager having to figure out what to do about the thousands of photos of them sitting on parents' and grandparents' social media that is linked to their face but they didn't consent to having had taken or shared. Tell MIL this is baby's first lesson in consent. And that this child/teen will know that their parents and grandparents respected them enough to not put their photos all over the internet. \"MIL, seriously, nobody is posting photos of their kids on Facebook/whatever anymore. We know better now. If your friends are doing it, they are in the minority. It isn't okay.\" It sounds like you may need to explain this to your partner too. \n\nPlus, guess what MIL? People don't really care that much about seeing photos of the grandchild. An occasional photo? Sure. An entire album every other week? No one outside of the immediate family wants that. So this is even more reason to not post.  \n\nAnd if she still isn't getting it, you can tell her how public or even \"private\" photos of babies and kids get weird attention on social media. We all have friends we forgot about and some people's accounts are hacked or logged in in weird places. As much as we don't want to believe it, even with best intentions, you have no idea where that photo may end up. And just pop over to Instagram to see the weird and gross comments and likes on photos of naked baby butts or bathtub photos or toddlers in bikinis. \n\nYou can set up a shared Google photos folder album and invite close relatives to it. It is easy enough that they will figure out how to use it with some initial help. Then you and partner put a few photos a week into it while you keep most of the photos in shared albums with each other. If MIL shares a photo, remove her from the album.\n\nMIL desperately wants to show the grand baby to her besties? Tell her not to do it on social media. Hand the neighbor her phone. Get some photos printed at the store to put in frames or on the fridge (Google Photos ships photos and prints to your local CVS/Walgreens in minutes). Maybe text a photo to a distant aunt. \n\nBeing a parent includes creating boundaries for your kid. This is a good place to start.

Time to put her on an information diet.\n\nTell the person doing the scan that you want no cell phones in the room and only you have permission to receive photos of the scan. Not your partner. Because he will give them to his mother. Or, better yet, go to the scan with your mother and not your partner. That will drive the point home to him that you have firm boundaries and you won't let him trample over them.

What will happen is, mil will get worse when the due date comes closer and even worse when baby arrives. She\u2019s gonna be trying to insert herself and override you and your choices for baby, ridiculing you, barge in whenever she wants, taking baby from you whilst you were wanting to hold baby yourself, etc and when your in postpartum weakness and completely hormonal and vulnerable she will wear you down and establish herself as the dominant factor. Your partner is what is called \u2018in the fog\u2019 and she will slowly lead him down to more fog and he will be useless to you by this time and only adding to your misery and pain by taking his mothers side and insisting your dramatic difficult etc. And probably complaining about you along side his mother to their extended family. This is guesswork of course but years on those subs have taught me that this is at least a realistic possibility. The question is: would you want to end up in that situation? The question for your partner is: is he willing to put you and your baby together (in other words: his family) before his mom (his extended family)? If he can\u2019t give you a clear answer than I\u2019m sorry but unless you accept being the third wheel in your relationship and house, I\u2019m afraid requiring him and the two of you to go to therapy immediately both together and him individually (perhaps you too) and if he refuses or if it doesn\u2019t change anything fast enough, you might consider leaving him before the birth (because after everything including standing your ground will be a lot harder) and start over with the people in your life who do not disrespect you.

Scans are not little \"meet the new human\" parties, they are medical checkups to determine the health and wellbeing of you and your baby. Unless someone has YOUR EXPRESS PERMISSION they belong to you, for the use of yourself and your medical care team. Nobody needs a copy and I wouldn't be sharing it with anyone you don't explicitly trust. Ask your OH if he'd be happy with your mam releasing his medical info to the world, I'm sure he wouldn't like that and justifiably so. If MIL continues to boundary stomp, give her a time out.

His behavior and your MIL's will only get worse once the baby comes if you don't nip this in the bud and lay down hard boundaries with your husband and MIL. It's imperative you two show a united front against your MIL.\n\n\n\n\nIf your husband can't put his own wife and unborn child before his mother then he shouldn't have gotten married.

Her feelings don't matter in this pregnancy and let's be real, you can make it way more miserable for them.", "NTA but your partner is. He needs to set boundaries.", "bud, not butt\n:)", "Unfortunately your partner will never truly choose you and based on the comment might even choose his mum over your child as well.
