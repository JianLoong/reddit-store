Since then we have had no real issues, just been civil. I recently found out I was pregnant, this will be her first grandchild (as well as my parents first grandchild).

I am now 13 weeks, I have told some of my extended family on my side but haven\u2019t got round to telling my friends yet, I really want to tell them in person but it\u2019s hard work trying to organise a get together.

OK. There's a lot to unpack here. \n\nFirst of all, MIL is way out of line. Your body, your pregnancy,  YOUR uterus in the scan - your choice. Bodily consent goes so much further than people realise and absolutely includes everything to do with pregnancy.\n\nAlso, it's such a boomer thing to insist on everything going on social. I had this battle with my (now estranged) mother too. She whinged about it but she did actually follow our wishes.\n\nSecondly, your partner needs to decide who he's having a baby with - you, or his mother. Believe me, if he's more worried about mummy than his wife, that's a massive issue that will only get worse. \n\nNows the time to work on clear boundaries ( a boundary isn't trying to control someone else, it's deciding what you will and won't tolerate and then following through with consequences if your boundaries are crossed) and have some possibly uncomfortable talks with SO. He needs to get his priorities right.\n\nSo. No more photos for MIL if she can't be trusted (it's like a toddler yeah? 'If you can't keep these images off social then we can't let you have them at all'), and some very real talks with SO.\n\nOtherwise the next argument will be over them barging into the birthing suite while you're still being put back together because 'they were just so excited'.\n\nEdit: A word", "NTA but don\u2019t share your scan photo with your mother in law. She\u2019s proven to want to override you. \n\nWhat I\u2019m also seeing is you\u2019ve got the beginnings of a partner problem. He can disagree with you (it\u2019s his news too) but calling you selfish? Oh no. Nope this needs to be talked about. Because you have the birth coming up and it sounds like she\u2019ll want to insinuate herself in that.\n\nThat said just tell your friends via sms. There are going to be some friends you just won\u2019t see in person, let go of the perfect announcement. Just make it public in one hit.", "NTA, but seems like your husband is TA\nYour MIL treats you like you\u2019re just an incubator for HER grandchild. Notice how I didn\u2019t say \u201cyour child\u201d instead? Because she doesn\u2019t even percept this child as yours. I would also advise you to stay very cautious about her involvement in your family\u2019s life. I say it with 99.9% confidence that she will become very annoying once the baby is born and try to cross your boundaries while you\u2019re still weak and recovering. Do not let that happen. Ideally, you would want to get full support from your husband, but I don\u2019t know if this is possible. Remember, this is your and your husband\u2019s child only and only you can make decisions in this regard including posting or not posting any images or sharing information.", "NTA.  Fuck what is wrong with some people?  Your news, your timeline.", "NTA. It's your pregnancy. Of course she is excited and she can be. I'm sure it's great to become a grandmother for the first time. But posting pictures of your scan while being asked not to is selfish. \n\nI think your husband should take your side btw.", "NTA. Your baby, your news. Don\u2019t give her the scan photo until you are ready to announce it yourself", "Thanks everyone, unfortunately my partner seems to think his mother does no wrong and is always justifying her actions and behaviour. I\u2019m really not sure how to overcome this, we have spoke about it multiple times however he always seems to take his mums side and never believes she is in the wrong. She is very manipulative and I believe this plays a huge role but he just can\u2019t see that. If I had his full support on the matter it would make it so much easier, I have tried reasoning with him and explaining that my parents don\u2019t act like that but he just says that\u2019s because my parents don\u2019t care, which is not true in the slightest. The pregnancy was an accident, we have been together since high school - 8 years this year, however since we moved in together 5 months ago we have had many issues, I have always wanted children but since these issues started I wanted to wait a while so I knew it was the right thing to do, however like I said it happened by accident so I had no choice really", "NTA but it sounds like you have a husband and a MIL problem now. You need to nip this in the butt now or it will only be worse when the baby comes. You need to tell your husband he can either respect your boundaries when it comes to his Mother or he and his Mother can respect your boundaries when you\u2019re divorced and sharing custody.", "Realistically it\u2019s your baby I mean, if u really wanted you could ask for your husband to not even be involved in this scan. I don\u2019t think you should do this as this should be a moment shared between mother and father. I think u should just request that the MIL patiently waits outside as she should not be involved in this scan whatsoever especially if her only reason is just to post it on Snapchat.", "NTA but your partner is (and your MIL too obviously). He should be on your side and should tell his mother to calm the heck down if she wants to be allowed in her grandkid's life.\n\nYou're the one who's pregnant. You can not allow her in the scan room - technically you can decide who you want with you and you can even tell your partner he's not allowed if you think he'll take pics to give them to his mom, which would be a shitty thing to do.\n\nYou have clear boundaries and she's overstepping them on purpose because she wants to be the one in charge. She harassed you until you went along with what she wanted - both for the house and for announcing your pregnancy earlier that you wanted to. It's time to have a very firm conversation with your partner and his mother to let them both know that you won't take this crap anymore and if she try one more thing she'll be banned from seeing your kid since you can't trust her - and you can't trust your partner who's taking his mom's side when he should take his partner's side.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
