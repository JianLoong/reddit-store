Another pregnancy when your baby is so young must be overwhelming.  \n\nI think you need to do more than just having your husband get some treatment for his depression.  I\u2019d consider marriage counselling because you need to work through your expectations for each other and how childcare and house duties will be shared.\n\n I\u2019d also recommend getting as much childcare and housekeeping assistance as you can afford.  Young parents often feel like they have to handle everything themselves.  Getting help will make you better parents and better partners to each other.  So based on your budget consider one or more of the following: preschool or daycare options for your toddler if they aren\u2019t already going, get a cleaning service   \nonce a week, see if you can find someone willing to do laundry for you a couple of times a week (including folding), hire a teenager or college student to be a mother\u2019s helper in the afternoons, hire a babysitter so you can have some date nights, etc.  Don\u2019t feel guilty about trying to make things a little more manageable during this period of your life.", "Y\u2019all are going through a lot.

It sounds like he's trying to force you to take most of the responsibility here because he can't.  Or he doesn't feel that he can.  He feels overwhelmed and he wants you to fix it.  Which is something depressed people often do, so I get it.  I hope he gets past what he needs to get past soon for the sake of your marriage.  I was in a similar situation as OP many years ago and although we made it through, I ended up with some permanent resentments against my husband because I was expected to raise our kids and his kids essentially without his help for years.  It was NOT good for our marriage.", "NTA yeah he's overwhelmed but hey so are you. He can't use that as an excuse to shirk his responsibilities. Okay he's going to a dr.

Soft you are the AH for referring to the children your husband had before you met as just \u201chis\u201d while referring to the dogs your husband had before you met as both of yours. Your husband is the major AH for continuing to play with \u201chis\u201d daughter after she told him to stop. Children deserve bodily autonomy just as much as adults, and it is SO important to teach them that they have the right to say \u201cno\u201d and that their \u201cno\u201d should be respected, and by doing this you are also teaching them by example to respect other people\u2019s bodily autonomy. His disregarding her nonconsent is concerning and you should bring this up to him immediately, and it should be a firm rule with every adult\u2019s interaction with your children, that as far as their own bodies are concerned, their no means no. The 8 yo absolutely had the right to shout at him when he ignored her boundaries.\n\nAlso, I hope you never refer to the children as just his or just yours in front of them, and I hope if you continue to co-parent together, that you accept his children as your own (I don\u2019t quite understand the conventions around this, but you don\u2019t mention their bio-mom and it sounds like you are their primary parent, and they are young enough to need parents for many more years, and therefore to bond with you and see you as their mother, and imagine what it must be like to have one of your primary caregivers, who is the mother of your siblings, constantly refer to you as not theirs).\n\nDepression is a terrible disease, and you seem understanding of this, and it is good your husband is getting treatment, however it is not an excuse not to parent. In every example you give, instead of parenting the children directly, he yells at you for not doing it while he is in the same room. Mothers should not be the primary/default parent, and he is perfectly capable of talking to the children directly if he is capable of yelling at you about it (if he were catatonic or not able to speak because of depression, he wouldn\u2019t still be able to yell at you). Also you are PREGNANT, a full time parent to four kids and two dogs, taking care of the household, and also working. Although I have not been pregnant yet, I can\u2019t imagine that it is much easier than being clinically depressed (and I am chronically, non-functionally depressed. Also I know they aren\u2019t directly comparable like that. I just think if someone is pregnant those around them should do everything in their power to NOT stress them out and to give them time to rest, even if all they can do (because of depression) is talk to the children directly, and not yell at you). He can\u2019t put all the household and child-raising and dog-care responsibilities on you just because he is depressed and working, when you are pregnant and also working. He should care more about your health and the health of your future child.\n\nMaybe he can watch a movie with all of the kids while you take some time to yourself to rest, since he might not be up for doing anything more active. If he is up for it, he could take all the kids dog-walking, giving you a break, while teaching the kids how to be responsible pet owners and help out. Or take them all outside if you have a fenced yard and sit and watch them play. Walking outside is supposed to be helpful for depression, although I know personally how hard it is to get up and leave the house when depressed, and that a lot of these things people say help with depression (go outside for 15 minutes, just exercise, get up before 9 am even if you didn\u2019t sleep) might have helped them get out of their depression, but have barely helped me in my 20+ year depressive episode*.\n\nEdit to try to make this an asterisk instead of a bullet point: *Side note: The one unexpected exception to exercise not making a dent in my depression was when I went to boxing gym and worked out with a couple of actual boxers at 10 am. The coach had as doing intense exercises in rotation for about an hour. I was elated and relaxed for the rest of the day, and it was like \u201cis this is what it\u2019s like not to have depression and anxiety?\u201d Unfortunately I got a skin infection, probably from working out in pools of other people\u2019s sweat (they were wearing those plasticy suits to lose water-weight before a match and we were rotating equipment/exercise stations), combined with it being extremely humid, taking multiple showers a day, and not having good AC, so therefore my skin was never fully dry (it also started where the thick elastic waistband of my basketball shorts sat, so the least dry/air exposed area) Unfortunately by the time the infection had cleared, my anxiety and depression had kicked in and I never went back, now I don\u2019t live in that city anymore. I did try to do an online class with that coach during covid, but it didn\u2019t work out. Other intense exercises never made me feel this way or had any major impact on my depression, including a really intense Krav Maga class, hot yoga, working out in a gym, intense physical labor planting an orchard in the heat and humidity (I got heat exhaustion multiple times, but no big impact on my mood). Yes, I would feel better in that I was out of the house and doing something active, but I had to already feel better in order to do those things. I still don\u2019t know if it was the intensity, the type of exercise, something about boxing, the time of day, or if it was actually something about working out in other people\u2019s sweat making me feel so good for the rest of the day (like maybe I absorbed their endorphins that I was unable to make myself?) but I\u2019ve never experienced anything else like it, despite doing many similarly intense exercises. I still want to go back to that boxing gym or find something similar, but right now I don\u2019t even have the motivation to make an appointment for therapy or with a psychiatrist to change my meds.", "You are both under a lot of stress right now. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s seeing a doctor but part of his problem may be working night shift. I worked this shift for years because it saved on day care but at the same time I suffered from depression off and on.

That\u2019s what dads do.", "He's an ass for not listening to the 8 yr old when she said stop and he didn't.

Leaves a door open to predators.

Relationships are two way streets, right, and it doesn't take much effort for you to engage positively with him.", "Short answer ESH.  Yes-you both are burned out right now.  When was the last time you both slept or had an adult conversation that discussed your marriage?  Because that is what you should be doing instead of being on Reddit.  It's time that you consider getting some couples counseling as well as some permanent options for family planning since it sounds like you are both done having kids.  But this means that you both need to sit down and do it together instead of blaming or putting it on each other.\n\nExample:Husband gets his vasectomy scheduled today for before the baby comes.  You get your tubal scheduled for when you give birth so it's all one recovery.  Boom-one thing done.\n\nNext--do you treat him like a partner or like one of the kids? Is he overwhelmed--because it sounds like you think he's making that up? does he treat you like a spouse or like a nanny?  Are you feeling unappreciated?? Is that making you upset and treating him poorly? If so,  how can you work on that part of it?  If he is asking you to do too much, you need to have a safe word (sounds silly but it really works) and then it will remind you that you each need to each take a moment to collect your individual thoughts, deal with the immediate concern, and then figure out what each person is really mad about at that moment (because it's probably not that cup) and not say something that is going to make the situation more overwhelming for the other person.", "Yes, they should have the conversation about a vasectomy if they don\u2019t want more kids after this.", "[removed]", "All of this.

He is the asshole. He can't expect you to do it all. If the child didn't want him to play with her, he should have stopped when she asked him to. The world does not revolve around him. I know he is getting help for the depression but come on man, stop expecting her to do it all!", "During this moment of struggle and with his emotional absence is there a possibility of the older kids spending more time at their mother\u2019s house? I know it\u2019s not ideal, but their time with your family is really for them to be with their dad and he\u2019s not emotionally present. Its not perfect but I might be helpful temporarily until your family gets back on track.\n\nNTA you seem to be trying your hardest. He needs to step up and support changes being made to help yall out before your home life implodes completely.", "YTA.   \npeople really don't think further then baby names do they? lmao.  \n\"I'm tired! I want me time!\"....well shoulda thought about that before having more kids.", "I want to say \"Do you know about BC?\" But I feel like someone would try to call me out since they've got almost 6, Jesus, uhmm yeah I don't know ESH. I can't say go back in time and be safe but? What do you want in this situation, maybe a nanny if you have the money for one? Eh?", "Abort that sucka", "ESH - As others have said, he is still a parent despite whatever problems he is facing and he needs to be responsible. Working night shift doesn't automatically erase any childcaring/housing responsibilities that he has. If there was a drink left out he could have taken it instead of complaining since you were busy. \n\nIt seems you are taking care of the kids or the house considering you say you hardly get free time. He needs to help out.\n\nDiscipline also doesn't solely fall onto you but also him but keep in mind its your job to make sure his discipline is actually warranted and not for stuff like \"playing loudly\" during the evening. They are kids, they are going to be loud and punishing them for that is stupid. He should also make sure your discipline is fair too.\n\nYou need to start taking birth control and making sure your husband wears a condom because if you are that stressed with 4 kids there is no reason why you should be getting a 5th regardless of where the kids come from. At the end of the day, neither of you can complain about the number of kids since neither of you seems to have bothered with safe sex.\n\n>he was playing with the 8 year old and she asked him to stop, he didn\u2019t so I told him to stop and he told me I should\u2019ve told her to behave as she shouted at him\n\nThis is incredibly infuriating. If the kid asks you to stop, you fucking stop. Continuing to do whatever you are doing is breaking her boundaries and sending a message that her suffering doesn't matter as long as the parents have fun. It sets them up for a future where they'll constantly let people break her boundaries because that has been normalised for her. If they ask to stop, you stop. No bitching that she needs to be disciplined for shouting, no continuing. Nothing, you just stop.\n\nBoth of you need counselling, since you are both financially sound considering hiring a nanny or maid to alleviate the workload.", "Clearly you guys can't handle that much children. Both of you need therapy immediately and birth control after this pregnancy or things will go down pretty fast.", "I love having to scroll down this far to fine a response that isn't just shaming OOP for... not adequately being prepared for the number kids she took steps not to have. Like, seriously, did none of these people have enough sex ed to know that birth control can fail? Or are we still enjoying the school of aspirin between the knees to prevent babies?", "Honestly neither of them seem to want another child, but he's so against it, that it makes one wonder if she skipped pills or something, it obviously wasn't planned by both of them.", "This should be higher!", "I have 5 kids, two were conceived while using birth control (my 3rd & 5th)\n\nOnly once we were sure we were done having kids (after 5) did we get hubby snipped. \n\nIt\u2019s possible that this couple may have not been sure their family was complete and were using birth control that failed. It happens.", "Right? Plus she says she was on the pill and using condoms.", "This is a good response, and therapy is definitely warranted as is the most help you can afford.\n\nIt's unfortunate that your husband is experiencing sadness and depression at the same time you are pregnant. However, he does need to step up for his children or they will be experiencing the same, and they definitely won't understand why. He simply can't withdraw from them and leave it all to you.", "Yes, it should be. It\u2019s the best comment yet.", "Given that she seems to have primary caretaking responsibilities,  physically spawning them is less relevant.", ">Unless your plan is to die at 40 it is extremely young!\n\nIn a bid to sound more and more like a Boomer every day, I think it's just a Gen Z thing.  I had one tell me that I was middle aged when I was barely 30 years old.\n\n>I couldn\u2019t imagine raising 5 kids on top of all that!\n\nThis.  I was a walking, talking dumpster fire in my 20's; I can't imagine how much more stressful things would've been to be trying to figure myself out AND keep 5 kids healthy and relatively happy on top of that.", "Depends on location and generation, I guess. A lot of millennials don't have their first until their late 20s/early 30s. I'm one of those. But I lived in a small, culturally conservative, fairly religious town for a while and a lot of my peers back there got married between 18-22 and started having kids right away. I don't think 5 by 31 is super common for this generation though.", "If you live in a state with an abortion ban all the more reason to brush up on your birth control knowledge and make sure you're using it correctly.   This reeks of user error", "Or both", "Oh this is totally possible! Ask me how I know! Currently pregnant with a second child conceived while on birth control! Lol", "Women blaming behavior, you can take birth control effectively and still have a miss that leads to an unfortunate pregnancy.", "I have read some posts where the husband withdrew because he was convinced a kid couldn\u2019t be his. So who knows what he is thinking?", "Also, if he didn't want more kids, why didn't he get snipped.  It is infinitely easier for a man to get a Vasectomy than a woman to get a tubal ligation and less invasive.", "Would getting on any birth control right after giving birth even okay? Because I know it can cause emotional or hormonal shifts and well, you\u2019d just given birth", "It's dumbass behavior. It took 2 of them", "They were just agreeing with you and adding info that OP and her husband should've been a 2nd form, just like the instructions that come with the prescription say.", "Isn't it the same healing time? Sorry, I'm 17 and don't know about vasectomy, all I've ever heard is it's easier but wouldn't it be the same healing time? Or close to similar?", "Most OBs will discuss/prescribe birth control at your 6 week follow up because you are not supposed to get pregnant that quickly after giving birth.", "tubal is 2-3 weeks to recover, vasectomy is 2-3 days", "No. Hysterectomy or tubal ligation is major surgery, while a vasectomy is a minor procedure.", "Nah, vasectomy heals much faster because its little tiny tubes and can be done through a little bitty incision.\n\nA Vasectomy is a really quick, easy procedure. I could probably do one right now with my embroidery knife and a tube of super glue and while the patient might not appreciate it very much (although obviously if they had some pain relief it'd go more easily) \n\nI'm fairly confident that everything would go fine. Its just not a very complicated surgery, as surgeries go. (Disclaimer: Don't do DIY vasectomies or really any home surgery if you can help it! This is meant to be semi-informative and not a guide to self sterilization. I'm a farm girl who has castrated a LOT of male animals and knows how testicles are put together, I've also watched my cousin do horse vasectomies, not castrations but vasectomies, and know the routine. Despite this, I do not plan to do anyone's vasectomy. Go to a doctor, they have good drugs and scalpels that have never been used to scrape glitter glue off cloth.)\n\nTubals are much more complicated because its larger incisions, further apart (so more wounds in total that have to heal, a vasectomy can be one small incision or two even smaller ones. A tubal can be done various ways, but they are all much more invasive since the uterus and fallopean tubes are deeper inside than the testicles) and even the least invasive option (which is through the vagina and cervix, then up into each tube to cut and burn the tissue) is very invasive and has difficulties.\n\nIt has to be done right after birth, or using dilating procedures on the cervix, which is painful and a pain in the ass to do. (Took my cousin four tries because the stupid rods kept falling out of her cervix so she wasn't open enough.) \n\nPlus, not every doctor is comfortable doing it that way, iirc the most common method is Laparoscopic and that's three incisions or more to the abdomen, put tools inside and inflate the cavity so the tools can move around all the organs, and do the thing. Afterwards, everything inside is bruised and traumatized and it takes a long time to heal because its all so deep in the body. \n\nPlus, getting that air out is agonizing. Its the same for every laparoscopic surgery. (I had my gallbladder taken out and the air traveled into my shoulder to come out apparently. I broke my collar bone and dislocated my should once falling out of a tree and it hurt less than that off gassing BS.)\n\nThen there's the old school method which is a big c-section style incision and open surgery. I'm not sure anyone does these routinely anymore, other than when a woman chooses to get her tubes tied during her c-section, which is honestly a great time to get it done if you're done having kids. Everything's open anyway, and the doctor can get it done in a hurry. Several of my relatives have had this done and they all agree its a great idea for sterilization.\n\ntl;dr:\n\nVasectomy is much easier.", "No, unless there are complications,  a Vasectomy is a short out patient procedure,  a tubal ligation is at best a  laproscopic, non invasive surgery,  but most commonly done during a Cesaran Section.", "Plus many doctors insist women have to have multiple children before they\u2019re do a hysterectomy. Even though OP is 26, they might say \u201cwell are you SURE you don\u2019t Wang more kids?\u201d And delay the appointment by a year or more. Not saying OP asked for one, but there\u2019s a lot of research on how much easier it is for men to get a vasectomy and how doctors just won\u2019t do a hysterectomy on some women.", "There\u2019s also still a chance of ectopic pregnancy with a tubal ligation.", "If the man does not follow up and make sure his Vasectomy was successful, he can impregnate a woman whose ligation grew back together.   Source: a friend of mine who became pregnant after a tubal ligation and post Vasectomy .", "All of this.   \n\nI went to see about getting my tubes ties when the whole Roe V Wade thing was going down - only to immediately get shot down because (A) I'm apparently too young at 32, (B) What if my husband wants kids???.   Nevermind the fact that I would likely NOT be able to carry a successful pregnancy to term due to health conditions or the fact that I am a whole ass adult capable of making my own decisions; It boiled down to \"Well, your husband might want kids!\", even though I took my husband to the appointment and he straight up said \"Nah, also her body, her choice\".  \n\nWhen he inquired about getting a vasectomy, it was like \"Yeah, no probs, we can have you in and get it done next week\".  That was it  (He didn't for a variety of reasons - but the ease with which he could have had HIS procedure done drove me nuts)", "Hmm, ok thank you", "On top of that there side effects to a hysterectomy. Everyone I know who had a hysterectomy has much more severe periods. Much more severe. I didn\u2019t have to get one. My husband offered to do the vasectomy.", "Ah ok", "This was really informative. Thanks", "Or the question I got from one doctor, what if your husband wants more kids?\n\nI told him that he would have to find someone else cos I was done.", "Bullshit. He had a vasectomy and still had a baby? OK, believeable, it happens... She had a tubal right after that baby and then got pregnant with another, despite the tubal and vasectomy?? And the \"doc didn't charge\" nonsense. Come on.", "You don\u2019t get periods at all after a hysterectomy, they literally remove your uterus.  Which is where periods come from - the lining of the uterus sheds every month if the egg isn\u2019t fertilized and implanted\u2026", "I also don\u2019t trust tubal ligation since that\u2019s how I have an uncle. \n\nWith vasectomy at least you can check if the swimmers are still getting out. You can\u2019t check if an egg finds a way until\u2026", "It is true.  A coworker of mine.  It was a big story all over the building.", "As a wise man once said, nature finds a way.", "Sorry, they were lying to ya'll. If both were surgically sterilized (and I'm assuming by different doctors since they are totally different procedures usually preformed by different Drs like a urologist and an obgyn) it is super unlikely they'd have a baby immediately after birthing one anyway. They just weren't taking precautions. It is called Irish twins when people have a kid right after one. A lot of people mistakenly believe you can't get pregnant while breast feeding."]}
