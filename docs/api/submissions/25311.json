Previous post was removed.\n\nMy (19f) flatmate's (20f) mother came to visit her yesterday and brought her younger daughter with her (11?f) who I'll call sally. My flatmate, who'll be referred to as Sarah, was in the shower when her mother and sister arrived. I didn't want to be rude and excuse myself immediately after they stepped in, so I waited until Sarah was done showering.\n\nI made small talk with her mother and when Sarah finally made it out of the shower, I went back to my room. I assumed they'd want space and I honestly wasn't feeling very social anyway. Less than ten minutes after I went to my room, Sarah's mother came walking in without knocking or anything and I was honestly so confused. She then asks if her baby can play with my \"big girl stuff\", and then walks out without even waiting to hear my answer.\n\nThe big girl stuff she was referring to was my PC that had my drawing tablet attached to it, (I started doing digital art years ago.), my skincare products ( we have a shared bathroom, so I don't leave anything in there), my plushies/teddy bears (some of which were gifts from my boyfriend), and my sketchpads and pencils/colored pencils. I politely asked sally to leave, but she kept insisting that she stay since her mother gave her permission to play with my things.\n\nSurprisingly, the plushies weren't the first thing to interest Sally. Instead, it was the cirkul cartridges I had in a little basket on my desk. She started walking over to my desk and I moved the basket before she had the chance to open any of them. She asks if she could have one but I said no. She then says \"My mom will buy some\" and leaves the room presumably to go tell her mother about this \"candy\" she wants.\n\nI took that opportunity to lock the door, and when she gets back and realises that the door was locked, she knocked for a few minutes before stopping. I thought that she got the hint, but I guess not because there was more knocking, except this time it's her mother asking me to open the door. I ignored all the knocking and instead put my airpods in and took a nap. Sally and her mother were gone when I woke up and my flatmate has not said one word to me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692755935, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ypya5/aita_for_not_letting_my_flatmates_sister_play/", "score": 162, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Seems like that's the most important lesson you can teach a kid. Good on you for standing up for yourself.", "NTA. Its your property, and most of these arn't toys anyway. To b fair to your mate though, I don't think her mom would have listened to her even if she had tried to stop her, and her silence might be as much from shame as from anger at you. Or am I too optimistic in assuming anyone from that family has a sense of shame.", "NTA and damn don\u2019t these people respect boundaries? You don\u2019t just go barging into someone\u2019s room and invite yourself to other people\u2019s belongings. I\u2019d still address it with your flatmate. Let her know how it was wrong of her mother to do that.", "NTA\n\nNeither your flatmate nor her mom have any rights to your things or your room. Nor do you have any responsibility to entertain the kid.", "NTA - might want to talk to Sarah and say that if Sally breaks anything of yours she is replacing it. That may make her think twice letting her mom and sister ask again. \n\nYour roommate sucks, and if possible you may want to look at moving. If this is a new lease then she will likely act like this the whole time.", "Now you know why your flat mate moved out from Moms....NTA", "NTA \n\nI would have told the child to leave and pushed her out so quickly if she didn\u2019t", "Nta. We all have our spaces with stuff we care about and kids fuck shit up and don't care and some parents don't care what their kids fuck up either. You nailed it and did exactly what I would have. Personal spaces and boundaries are important. When kids touch my TV or have greasy ass hands and want to use my Xbox controller I'm like hell nah go wash ur greasy ass hands and then u can play. If kids dont listen to rules in my space then they can't come in my space.", "Buy a small dildo and put some batteries on it.

OP is NTA", "Honestly, im just going to lock my door when they visit", "PLEASE do that. Make sure to lock the door when you leave the house as well.

You should have a conversation with your roommate about boundaries and respecting your space; make it clear to her that her mom had absolutely no right to expect you to babysit the sister for her, much less expect you to give the sister access to your belongings. And also get a lock for your door!", "NTA - Nobody has the right to make you share your belongings.", "Holy guacamole\n\nNTA, crazy people out there", "NTA- Your roommates mom saw your room as an extension of her daughters space\u2026 not the separate space that it is. \n\nShe needs to remember you are only the roommate not family\u2026 she can\u2019t just enter your private space without an invitation. She is only allowed in her daughters space and the common areas when she visits.", "NTA. I have raised four kids. From the time they could toddle, they were taught not to touch others people\u2019s belongings when we were visiting ANYWHERE. Kids get bored and hungry. Have simple, non messy snacks packed and a tablet/book/colored pencils/paper to alleviate boredom.\n\nIt\u2019s parenting 101. \n\n\nYour flatmate\u2019s family are being disrespectful and acting entitled. You are not the childminder or nanny when they visit.", "NTA. Good job holding your own.", "This happened to me once, except the entitled family member PICKED THE LOCK ON MY DOOR to let the children in.
