I took a mental note to talk to him about looking at his phone and to pay a little more attention in class (the class is sewing and he is currently getting a B-, not too bad). Then she said something that just blew me away, she said that all the kids now were \"crazy\" and \"nuts\" going on about how they were all just disrespectful and basically didn't care about the school or society...\n\nI stopped her and said \"I can't believe that just came out of your mouth\" and could she repeat herself. At that time my wife said to stop it and was obviously embarrassed. Then the teacher doubled down and went off on a tangent explaining that all the kids are just awful and are destroying the school and have no respect for anyone, how they think nothing is their fault and that basically all the kids in the school are just terrible and selfish.\n\nMy wife and son were very embarrassed about the way I acted, but honestly if they wouldn't have told me to stop I would have escalated it because my son comes home every other day feeling like a failure after interacting with  this teacher.\n\nI guess what I'm getting at is, am I the asshole for embarrassing my son and wife or am I in the right to stand up to someone like this?", "created_utc": 1676609488, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/114azo1/aita_because_i_stuck_up_for_my_kid_with_a_teacher/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have the right to stand up about this, it feels uncomfortable for folks who don\u2019t enjoy confrontation to be part of that.

Honestly, you should let the principal know about what was said though, because it is not okay.", "you\u2019re NTA, some teachers aren\u2019t fit to teach and she sounds like one of them. how embarrassing for her. you did the right thing standing up for your son.", "NTA.  This woman should not be teaching if that's how she feels about \"today's youths.\"", "NTA. Kids are kind of odd right now, but society hasn't really helped them. Alert the principal of this and explain to your wife what she said. I assume neither of them really heard her over the phone.", "Whenever you make it an \"all the kids\" Its definitely the teacher.   I would secretly record next time", "NTA, and I would report the teacher.", "NTA\n\nAnd I would've told my wife and son to please step out so I can speak to this teacher in private. The only thing embarassing and disrespectful here is the teacher that hates kids.", "NTA This isn't even about your son. The teacher literally said ALL the kids were awful and destroying society. They should not be teaching if they feel that way! You know the saying, if everyone you meet is an asshole, you're TA? If every student a teacher has is disrespectful, it's the teacher!", "NTA take it to the school board and the principal. Write down your complaints and keep a digital trail. Involve a lawyer and media if this teacher is not referred for retraining or fired.", "YTA\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like this teacher worded things very well, but what if she had said, \u201cYour son\u2019s phone usage in class isn\u2019t just a matter of inattentiveness; it\u2019s also a matter of respect. When I\u2019ve asked him to put his phone away, he has at times responded disrespectfully, as have many of his peers.\u201d Because that seems like what she was trying to say.\n\nDoes it seem reasonable to have blown up at her for communicating a valid point inartfully?", "NAH, it\u2019s pretty obvious that teacher is really burnt out and given the demands put on teachers over the last few years, I can understand why. \n\nStill, it was inappropriate of her to say that in front of a parent and you were right to call her out. \n\n>\tthey were all just disrespectful and basically didn\u2019t care about the school or society\u2026\n\nI thought this part was funny, though. Like why would a 12yr old care about their school? They\u2019re being forced to be there.", "YTA. You just dissed the one teacher who was honest with you. My mother is a retired school teacher and even in a \u201cnice little town\u201d she managed some stories that were doozies.", "It's hard to say without hearing the teacher's side, so I agree with your wife and kid.", "Please sit down with your son and tell him that his teacher\u2019s attitude is wrong and ugly. Tell him it appears she has forgotten that you do NOT lump all kid\u2019s behaviors together, as in, if Timmy did something wrong then everyone is to blame, too. \n\nNTA. \n\nIf your son is coming home miserable due to this teacher, you should reach out to administration. Your wife also needs to get over being \u201cembarrassed\u201d because you calmly and rightly called out someone\u2019s garbage behavior and statements. \n\nMy son is 12. When he tells me about something that happened in school that could involve a parent\u2019s reaction, I ask him \u201cdo you want me to reach out to your teacher/administration, or do we want to wait and see if things change over the next week?\u201d That provides him some control and allows him make decisions. Obviously, if it\u2019s bad, I\u2019ve explained I may not ask but gather facts and contact admin/teacher ASAP.", "NTA and I'd be reporting this conversation to the principal or school board.

You could have talked to her and if she needed any assistance or you could have went to the principal and explained that teacher seems to burnt out and on edge.", "NTA", "NTA. It was highly inappropriate for the teacher to make those comments, especially in front of a student and his parents. She's needs to save all that for her venting sessions.", "No. Go to the principle with your concerns and then the school board if you feel the need rises.", "She has been teaching for over 20 years and is close to retirement now. I feel bad for all the kids that have felt like crap after her sewing class.

It\u2019s disappointing.", "I'm really not bothered about her mentioning the phone use, it's good to know that that's happening. (In fact that was something we talked to him about after).She even said that she doesn't mean he's like the kids she mentioned. I'm just bothered that she said that, and that I might have embarrassed my wife and son", "He's a parent to a student, not her therapist. She's an adult that needs to retire or change professions if she is so unhappy.", "As a teacher, if she\u2019s burnt out and on edge, she should retire and not take that out on kids.", "It\u2019s really not the parents job to do that, though. This teacher is an adult and I agree that she is very burnt out but ultimately it\u2019s on her to figure out how to work through that. She still has to be professional with parents.", "You need to report this conversation so the principal can assist her to her retirement. She's checked out already.", "It is disappointing. It makes a case for ESH. Let\u2019s even say for argument\u2019s sake that she is a below-average teacher with a chip on her shoulder. Does that justify making a scene?", "How much is your son\u2019s and wife\u2019s embarrassment a contributing factor to whether or not you were being an AH? To me, that doesn\u2019t factor in much.

To reiterate, I don\u2019t agree with this teacher or accept her behavior.
