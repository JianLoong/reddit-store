Your fiancee sounds entitled as all hell. I'd recommend you tell her no, leave it at that, but seriously reconsider how you view her if she keeps pushing. If she's being this entitled over airline benefits she'll likely be entitled over other things too. Or, already has been, but this was the first time it touched a nerve with you.", "NTA. I think she is testing you. Idk why people do this but it feels like an \u201cOh is my daughter important to you? Than sacrifice everyone else\u201d.", "NTA\n\nHer daughter is 6. It's not like she's flying anywhere on her own. \n\n\nPresumably, if you're getting married, it's going to be family vacations and some form of joint finances, so it sounds like using the buddy passes on Maddie makes sense. It honestly sounds like Taylor is just entitled like making you \"prove\" that you care about her. \n\n\nYou aren't financially supporting your sister in any other way, that could affect you as a couple, are you?\n\n\nAlso, even if flying is free, how often does she plan on traveling with a 6 year old? That can change the calculus. Like, if she travels monthly so Maddie can see her grandparents, that ends up being costly. If they go on vacation 1-2 a year, and you have no issue using the buddy passes, then it really doesn't matter and it just seems like a sense of entitlement. \n\n\nAlso, who do you usually use the buddy passes on...would you ever say no to Maddie because they are used up? Are Maddie's expenses entirely on Taylor or joint? And who had the 4th benefit pass before now...You've been dating Taylor long enough to get engaged but she didn't have it? Or does the person have to be related?", "NTA at all. Your fianc\u00e9 is being unreasonable and harsh to your sister. If my fianc\u00e9 kept that up, they wouldn't be my fianc\u00e9 for long.", "NTA\n\nShe is 6 and isn't jet setting around the world. The buddy passes are more than enough. The benefit will mean much more to the adult who can use it.", "NTA- adding Maddie isn\u2019t practical and just seems to be something Taylor wants on principle. You\u2019re not saying Maddie couldn\u2019t go on trips with y\u2019all and I think it\u2019s fair to assume a 6 year old won\u2019t need to catch flights on a weekly basis. Removing your sister would have a much bigger impact and I think it\u2019s thoughtful to keep her on your account.", "NTA. There is a difference between telling someone No and being TA. I think your fianc\u00e9 is trying to use emotions and relations as a weapon to get something she has decided is a good idea. There is also a difference between something being a good idea, and being necessary. TL;DR: She asked. You said no.", "NTA and instead of being thrilled that she gets to fly for free and her daughter only pays $60, she has a fit that her daughter also doesn't fly for free?  Entitled much?  She is being selfish in wanting to deny your sister the benefit, who can fully use it, to give it to her daughter who might use it a couple times per year.\n\nIs she like this about other things?  Does she resent anything you do for your family, for your sister?  I'd do some serious thinking about this person and relationship.", "NTA\nBetween the buddy passes & discounted fares, there's no practical reason for a child,  who won't be planning her own travel for another decade or so, to have independent access to those flight benefits. \n\nNot digging Taylor's attitude about your sister at all- pretty judgmental and Shannon's finances aren't any of her business. Please take a good hard look this because I have a hunch this may not be the first time and won't be last time she expresses resentment of your sister & your closeness with her.", "NTA. Wouldn't your brother or dad be the \"logical\" one to remove? Not the youngun with energy to travel?\n\nAt the end of the day though, this is just an asset you have that your willing to share with love ones.

But its still YOURS and you get to pick.", "NTA\n\nIt's your benefits for your family to use how you see fit. Fiancee seems like the AH to me", "NTA.

Two different things.", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 is being ridiculous.  \n\n\nShe doesn't get to dictate who you have on your benefits, especially since it will not make much of a difference to her and her daughter, but will make a big difference to your sister.", "NTA, mainly because it makes no economic sense to put Maddie on the benefits at this point since she wouldn\u2019t use it that much and you can cover her cheaply when she does use it. I understand your fianc\u00e9 is probably concerned that this may reflect you not seeing Maddie as your real family member, so maybe try to reassure her of that and point out that you\u2019ll obviously be paying to fly Maddie whenever your new family wants to go someplace.", "Jeez Louise, it's not like you're expecting the 6 year-old to pay for her own flights.", "NTA at all. You are close with your family and rightly so, they should be on it. Your fianc\u00e9 sounds kinda entitled, she should be happy that she\u2019s getting free flights and now only has to pay for her child. Don\u2019t back down on this OP.", "NTA; it's a fabulous benefit and you choose who gets it. It sounds like you already have a plan for covering most of Maddie's travel with buddy passes. You are very generous to share the benefit with Taylor and it sounds like you've approached the decision with thoughtfulness. It's a major red flag that Taylor is overreacting to this. Definitely work this out before marriage because this type of patten might continue.", "NTA. You're not suggesting that you two just leave Maddie at home when you take vacations. You can still take her with your for a nominal fee. I have no idea why your fiancee cares whether your step-daughter is part of your official \"flight circle.\" But it does bother me that she cares so much.", "NTA", "NTA. Taylot is being ridiculous", "What you are doing is logical, but remember that emotions are not logical. Your fiance is seeing this as rejection. I think she is wrong, but you need to have a deep conversation with her about this. While your sister is in school, I can see leaving her on the benefit. When she graduates and has a job it may be time to change. Either way, remember that when you are married it isn't \"your\" benefits. For a healthy marriage, everything must move from mine and yours to ours.", "Sounds like your fianc\u00e9e is just using you. Obviously NTA", "NTA.  Not at all. \n\nYour fiance asked, you explained why it can't be done, then provided the solution.  A very logical, reasonable solution.  The fact that your fiance then basically called your sister a freeloader makes her an ah.  Think long and hard about whether she'll be doing that the rest of your lives together.  \n\nGood luck.", "The possible way to end this is to offer paying for Maddie when you travel with her. \n\nYou keeping your sister is a gesture of looking out for her. She is 23. It is nice that you are looking out for her while she sort out her beginning years of adulthood. \n\nAlso, i dont get it. Your fiance undermining your generosity towards your own sister while expecting the same person to extend generosity towards her child is illogical to me.", "NTA as others have said there are some big red flags here in the fact your fiance immediately jumped to your sister being taken off. I would assume she knows about your sister's situation considering you're going to marry this woman. And if she is aware that makes this even more concerning. Why not bring up taking your brother off? That would make more sense. Idk I just get bad vibes with how defensive she got right off jump over something that is very inconsequential in the grand scheme of things", "NTA. Whose benefits are these?", "NTA\n\nDue to the fact that your proposition is financially beneficial to everyone at the moment.\n\nHowever, you have to consider revisiting this once Maddie is of age and could very well travel on her own. This can be something you can discuss with your fianc\u00e9e now to do down the road.\n\nAlso, consider her words against your sister. She is your fianc\u00e9e / future wife, and you may have to make hard decisions to choose between your original family and your married family. If you are not on the same page, you both might have resentments and regrets in the future.", "NTA", "Do you guys travel a lot by plane? Seems like a lot of complaining and fighting for nothing if you have buddle passes.\n\nNTA", "NTA - for a 6 year old?? Maybe this is a power trip?", "NTA. Why would you remove your sister who actually uses your benefits? Maybe if she suggested removing someone who doesn't use them. But still not worth it. \n\nI grew up with flight benefits because both my parents worked for the airlines. We flew a LOT. But before I was in high school, I definitely didn't fly more than 8 times a year. Once I got to high school, my mom would take me on her trips at least once a month. But they were totally unnecessary, we'd do go to Peru just because manicures were cheaper there.", "NTA  Wanting you to remove the 23yo parentless sister is just cruel, and 8 passes per year is plenty of trip opportunities with a 6yo.   But tread carefully in this relationship.", "I tried to read this but I can\u2019t get over \u201cme\u201d being used as a subject that many times.", "Offer to pay the $60 for the kid. And if your fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t say thank you and end it there, I recommend you end the relationship.", "NTA but YWBTA if this continues indefinitely. It should be obvious to everyone involved that at some point your step daughter ought to replace a family member, but that age is certainly not six. You should be willing to talk about how the situation will change once your future daughter is old enough to visit extended family without escorts, but in the meantime, it's not a significant expense, which makes it reasonable to give the larger benefit to family.", "INFO: How did you get to be a higher up at a company if you can't write coherently?", "NTA the benefits should go to whoever can get the most use out of them. On the other hand though long term it will likely make sense to changing it to just your household.", "I think the reasons you've given for wanting Shannon on your benefits are good ones. It's important to communicate those clearly to her, like you did here, if you hadn't already. She should respect this being important to you. You spending $60 once or twice a year for your sister to have something that really helps her is a kind and imo reasonable thing, of course depending on your financial situation but I don't get the impression it's a huge sum for you guys. It's also not fair for her to criticize your sister or her life choices. She's the a-hole for saying those things about your her. \n\nThat being said I wouldn't at all be surprised if this isn't so much about airline benefits as it is about knowing that you will put your new little family-unit above your extended family. I think what she needs to feel better about this is reassurance that she and your child (being step- doesn't matter, you've taken on the role) will come first.\n\nYou say your brother and your dad are also on your benefits. Have you considered them and their situations?\n\nEdit: Forgot the verdict: NTA or light ESH", "Nta", "Ps when it comes to the will, will there be a fight? Are you putting your wife as beneficiaries? Sharing it with your siblings?", "NTA. How often is your fianc\u00e9 expecting a 6 year old to travel? To me it sounds like she\u2019s jealous of your relationship with your sister and is trying to establish her daughter as more important than her.\n\nTo each their own but that would make me feel uncomfortable. I\u2019m very close to my siblings and their children so anyone who dates me has to respect my relationship with them the same way I would respect the relationship with their family. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a full on red flag yet but something you should keep an eye on.", "NTA but I would recommend paying the cost of the buddy pass for Maddie when she travels. I question why your fiance is so negative about your sister. Is this a test? I would be concerned about someone demanding that I cut out a family member as proof of love, especially when there is a very reasonable and affordable accommodations for Maddie.", "NAH: Your benefits, your choice. I don't get why you don't remove your father or brother. Or why your fiance asked for your sister to get removed (don't Dad and bro already have jobs and can pay for their own tickets?).\n\nShe can be upset. You're saying her daughter is like your own, but you're not treating her that way. She could see this as a red flag to how you'll treat her when/if you and she have more children together.", "Neither is an asshole here. You both need to talk this one out. It's tapping into your fiancee's fear that you will never quite lover Maddie like a true daughter. You refusing to put her on there is a deep seated fear manifest.", "NTA, the arrangements you have are just fine. Things will change over time. You can add Maddie later.", "NTA and your fianc\u00e9e is being ridiculous.  Does she think that her daughter will be flying more than 8 times a year?  This is simply a power play by her.", "NTA The passes were all handed out previous to her coming along.\nIf they are maxed out so be it.\nYour fiancee is being entitled and ridiculous demanding free benefits for a 6yr old when $60 is cheap enough.\nInstead of complaining she should be showing gratitude.\nI feel like this is the tip of the iceberg in red flags to come.!", "NTA why does a child need flight rewards? The only time she will be going anywhere is with you two anyway. Sounds like she thought she would get all the benefits now since she\u2019s moving up to the wife status. Time to have the not everything I have will be yours talk.", "NTA. I think it's concerning that she expects you to take your sister off. It almost sounds like a dominance issue or she is jealous. Probably because she had her daughter young. But y t a for using \"are\" repeatedly instead of \"our\"", "NTA but just saying:\n\n> She is right **my sister doesn\u2019t work but that\u2019s because she in school** and she lives off the inheritance my mom left us. \n\n> given **her daughter is in school** majority of the year and will most likely not use the benefits as much as my sister uses it now", "NTA", "[deleted]", "NTA. The child is 6. This is a discussion that can happen later when she's older and when you can rearrange your benefits.", "NTA\n\nLots of reasons.  Your sister actually gets use of the benefits.  She\u2019s young and can travel as she pleases and can actually get good use of the benefit.  Your fianc\u00e9 sounds entitled.", "NTA tell her it\u2019s gotta be her or Maddie. Your sister deserves to be on it.", "This is behavior rooted in envy and you can ignore it. Your sister has an inheritance because she has no parents. She didn't win the lottery.

You\u2019re offering her something nice, and she\u2019s telling you that it\u2019s not enough because she\u2019ll have to pay a minuscule amount for her child to travel. \n\nShe\u2019s being entitled, and she\u2019s making it clear where he priorities are.\n\nShe\u2019s letting you know that it will always be Maddie over your sister for her, which makes sense because that\u2019s her child. But she hast to understand that your sister is closer to you in a similar way.", "NTA\n\nBig red flag though...take care.", "NTA and I pray you update us letting us know you stood your ground and kept your sister on.

What is a 6-year-old going to do with these airline benefits? Weekend trip to Ibiza by herself? You can take a family trip and - as you said - pay for her ticket. \n\nAlso, is your fiance not upset about your dad and brother getting the benefits? Why just your sister? \n\nIt may make sense for you to eventually switch the benefits to your child(ren) rather than siblings and parent. But not until the kid(s) are old enough to use them!", "NTA.  It\u2019s your benefits. You get to chose who is on the list.  End of story.  Besides, the finances makes more sense the way you have it", "Your fiance is a selfish person who has no right to tell what you should do, she telling you that you should remove your little sister show how she only cares about her and his daughter, set boundaries now and stand your ground, specially now that you're not married because it's one thing to be glad that your partner does thing for you and your child and another asking for it, especially if it affects other people negatively.\n\nAnother thing you need to talk about with her is that you are taking the role of father figure, but you never will be her father and she has no right to force you to do anything for her, she expecting it and calling you an asshole for not showing favoritism to a child that's not even your is ridiculous and make me think she thinks that her daughter and her are entitled to what you have. Again everything that you do for that child should come from your heart instead of she asking for it, set that boundary now because it would bite you hard down the road if you don't have that conversation now.", "After your married, YTA. It clearly shows you are not treating her as your daughter. My Dad, technically step-dad, was a pilot. I was added immediately after he and my mom married and we traveled alot as a family. Give the buddy passes to the family member you remove. \n\nTo all thise saying NTA, he will be her Dad and isn't treating her like a daughter.

If Shannon is living off of inheritance, it doesn't make a ton of sense to me that being on your benefits really helps her out in a meaningful way.
