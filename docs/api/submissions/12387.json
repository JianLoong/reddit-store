She's the one who opened my account when I was 13. And she's always watched my spending from work and would tell me or make a comment about it whenever I spent more than she thought I should or didn't approve of what I bought. When I was younger I was ok with it. But when I went to college I asked if she'd respect my privacy. She didn't. She would still do the same thing and when I moved back home after graduation it still did. Finally after god knows how many fights with her and dad I got her off my debit card. But she could still see my credit cause she's the one who applied. I kept this card because i admit to having a spending problem sometimes. And this card has a limit so I don't over do it. It's handy.\nI'm now 23 and I live on my own with my bf and pay my own bills and rent. Today she messaged me again saying she saw I spent money on an app game I have on my phone. Now I admit I spent more than I should have cause i was bored and wanted more opportunities to play on the game. I had already paid off the money I used but she didn't care about that. She said that I shouldn't be doing that and it was way to much. I got angry and snapped a bit that why was she looking at my account anyway. She said frivolous spending could effect her credit if I didn't pay. I asked her did I ever miss a payment? Did I have a bad credit score? Was I using her money?\n Answer to all no. My score is fine and I never miss a payment and I pay off my card when I get paid. I told her she was invading my privacy and I would hope she'd respect that and stop looking all this does is cause an argument whenever she does this and I don't like fighting we have a good relationship minus this . She then told me if it was such a big deal then cancel the card and get a new one without her. I said ya that's what I'm going to do because I'm tired of her snooping and lecturing me on spending MY money. She then said forget it and stopped texting me. I'm just waiting for later when dad calls to defend her like always. So AITA for yelling at her and telling her I'd cancel the account so she can't see it?\n\nEdit: Ok guys so gonna clear up some things. 1. The card is in my name my mom did get it when I was 13 and in her name then, when I was 18 we put it in my name as the carrier. Because the way her bank works I guess despite me being the primary she can still see cause she opened it at least that's what she has told me. \n2. This is not the first time this has been argued. When I was in college this happened and we had a blow out she agreed to stop. But when I moved back home she resumed and this fight kept happening. I gave up on the argument for awhile cause I just didn't want to deal with it I just snapped this time. It was building for awhile. Yes 3.I understand if I had just switched banks this wouldn't have happened but i was worried about the fall out and if my mom would just not get over it and hold it over me forever and didn't want to lose our relationship over something like this.\n\nI have also taken in everyone's opinions and thank you for them even if you think IATA. I understand this could have been avoided if I changed my bank but I'll admit I'm the optimist and was hoping she'd stop when I asked even though it was multiple times. My own fault and I am definitely changing my bank this week. Not excited about the fall out because I'm sure she'll guilt trip me when she finds out I move my funds but hopefully it will be 1 fight and when it ends this all just stops.

No. No it is not.", "If she doesnt use the one she has now, that would certainly work.   Mom is doing much more then covering both rears.   Shes snooping.  She judging.

However, her mother was also using her access at the bank to snoop into her daughter's account.", "Mom\u2019s name is also on the card, which means this card factors into mom\u2019s credit score. She\u2019d be crazy not to keep an eye on it. Frankly, she should insist that her daughter cancel it and get a new card. Then, everyone will be happy.", "That\u2019s not what I got from the post. Op should clarify if mom was monitoring through the bank or through all the cards and accounts they shared", "Where was that in the post?", "The reason many parents add their children to their CC is to increase their credit history; if OP doesn't open a new CC before the current one is cancelled then she's shooting herself in the foot & losing years of credit reporting from that card alone. Replace then remove her name from the account is the smart way to go.", "Mom is not just checking the total and making sure it gets paid.   She is checking where her daughter spends money and then lecturing her about it.   Cancelling the card, solves it all.

Doesn\u2019t make it right, but bitching about a situation she could solve in roughly 5 minutes seems odd.", "Honestly it's quite easy to remove someone from your credit card, if you're the primary holder. You can do it on the app or if you call the bank. Unless you have amassed tons of points, I suggest opening up a new one and only using that one for emergency/groceries/things she won't bitch about. \n\nNTA", "NTA but if your mom is concerned about what your spending might do to her credit score, why hasn't she requested to be removed from the account? If her name has been removed from the account, what she is doing would probably get her fired. If her name hasn't been removed, it is probably because she wants to be able to see what you are spending and gripe about it. Switch banks and be done with it. Simple as that. If she gets mad, that is her problem since she has no right to interfere in your finances now that you are an adult.", "if you want to be grown then act grown and move banks simple.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like you are a cardholder on your mother\u2019s credit card account. She said if a payment is missed her credit score will be affected which means she is liable for the charges made to that card, whether your name is the one stamped on it or not. \n\nI understand the appeal of having that card; my mom opened three different credit cards for me when I was a minor and I have amazing credit because those lines of credit have been increasing the average age of my credit since I was 12. But I also understand that any charges I make to those cards are viewable by my mother so I use the one card I still carry wisely. \n\nIf you want to cancel your card on your mom\u2019s account, do so knowing that your credit score will be affected by closing that account. If you can trust your mom to have continued access to that account and want to continue to reap the benefits to your credit score, apologize to her and do that. Either way, get your own credit card without your mother and start building credit on your own as well.", "I\u2019m wondering if the credit card is a \u2018secured\u2019 card? If you are worried about overspending because of too much credit (and cc company love to up your credit line!) open a new secured credit card. You decide the limit by depositing the funds with the bank. They issue a credit card that works exactly the same way as a regular card. It\u2019s what I did with my kids when they got their first cards. Both my 20 something kids still have those cards. One just upped her credit limit by adding funds to the account (paper work at the bank). I stay out of their accounts, but they know that what they do with those cards reflects on my credit score too. \nDecide if you want to keep the cc open or close it. You can get a new card and keep the old. By not closing the account, you may avoid too much drama with your mother. Longevity of a credit account historically has helped with credit scores. Not so sure now, so check with a credit specialist. \n\nYour mom may have the \u2018right\u2019 to know the details of the account, but she isn\u2019t right in accessing the account as much as she does. The extent\u2014if any\u2014I would deem appropriate is checking that payment is made on or before the due date. Anything else is invasive and out of line since she is no longer managing your living expenses and paying for your life.\n\nETA\u2014NTA", "NTA: you have to obtain your own accounts whether it be a deposit account or a credit card.  I\u2019m a banker and I had youth accounts for all the kids.  As soon as they reached 18, I removed myself from the account and had it restyled as a basic checking.\n\nTwo things to keep in mind.  1. If your mom is using the customer facing website or phoning customer service for an account she is also on, yes she can check balances and transactions, and her checking that whilst she happens to be at work say on a break, then she can do that.\n\n2. HOWEVER, if she is using her internal systems and employee access to track these accounts that is against policy at any bank I\u2019ve ever worked at.  It\u2019s an ethics violation and she risks termination for it.  I work in returns and I happened to recognize a name of a person I knew from school in my hometown on a check in my queue.  Even a person I haven\u2019t spoken to in decades I had to inform management that system delivered me that check and I had to document that I skipped it so another user could pick it up and work it.  Banks take this type of thing very seriously!  Your mom should absolutely not be using her internal access permission to do this, so I hope she\u2019s not doing this and using customer level tools. \n\nIn any case, open a new account elsewhere.", "NTA. My parents opened a bank account for me when i was in high school and refused to close it until i was 30 (i couldn\u2019t myself for various reasons), even after i was primarily using other accounts. The stress that comes with knowing your parents can and do look at your finances does not get better if they act like that, no matter how responsible you are. If you are an adult, you\u2019re paying your bills, and you\u2019re not hounding mom for money, what you spend money on is your business and none of hers. And yes, that includes spending money on a phone game that she thinks is ~too much. \n\nSide note: Having hobbies is healthy as long as you\u2019re conscientious about what you\u2019re doing, and if spending a little here and there on a game is a hobby and makes you happy, there is nothing wrong with that. The expectation that every penny go towards practical things or savings is unreasonable, and dropping some coin on a game isnt some moral failure unless it actively harms some other part of your life.", "Oh I work in the financial services industry and THIS IS TOTALLY F-N MESSED UP.

What she's doing is illegal!", "How long you have an account helps with credit scores. My 20 something kids still have the secured cards we jointly go when they were 17. I don\u2019t snoop into their accounts. Until they prove untrustworthy (missing payments), I don\u2019t get into their accounts and spending. At 22,, 23, 24, & 25, they are managing their own purchases. Sometimes you have to let them blow their money on stupid stuff and suffer from the stupidity. We talk about it, but it\u2019s their life. OPs mom needs to let go. Unless OP has proven untrustworthy with paying her bill on time, mom needs to back off. Or like the other commenter said, close the account and then mom doesn\u2019t have to worry about it. (But I get the vibe that mom likes having the ability to snoop into OPs spending and finances.)", "OP had already paid off the amount of money she spent on the game using the card BEFORE her mother texted her though. Her mother has no reason to lecture OP that a missed payment would cause an issue when OP paid off the card prior to the lecture.", "Not to mention the OP admits to having bad depending habits. I'd personally lean ESH as the mum does seem very controlling even if some of that control is justified.", "I don\u2019t believe you can remove the co-signer from the account without their consent. The bank would also have to run your credit and determine if you qualify. If it is a secured card, the funds used to open the account would have to be refunded, and that may necessitate the account being closed. I\u2019m not an expert, so please please please please op\u2014do your homework. Random strangers on Reddit are no replacement for seeking professional advice!", "If mom is that worried, she should cancel the card.", "Right?

It\u2019s no longer her business.", "Unless it is a joint account. Then it affects both credit scores.", "And? That does not give mom license to determine how she spends her money! If mom wants to limit how op uses the cc, mom should close the account.
