She's the one who opened my account when I was 13. And she's always watched my spending from work and would tell me or make a comment about it whenever I spent more than she thought I should or didn't approve of what I bought. When I was younger I was ok with it. But when I went to college I asked if she'd respect my privacy. She didn't. She would still do the same thing and when I moved back home after graduation it still did. Finally after god knows how many fights with her and dad I got her off my debit card. But she could still see my credit cause she's the one who applied. I kept this card because i admit to having a spending problem sometimes. And this card has a limit so I don't over do it. It's handy.\nI'm now 23 and I live on my own with my bf and pay my own bills and rent. Today she messaged me again saying she saw I spent money on an app game I have on my phone. Now I admit I spent more than I should have cause i was bored and wanted more opportunities to play on the game. I had already paid off the money I used but she didn't care about that. She said that I shouldn't be doing that and it was way to much. I got angry and snapped a bit that why was she looking at my account anyway. She said frivolous spending could effect her credit if I didn't pay. I asked her did I ever miss a payment? Did I have a bad credit score? Was I using her money?\n Answer to all no. My score is fine and I never miss a payment and I pay off my card when I get paid. I told her she was invading my privacy and I would hope she'd respect that and stop looking all this does is cause an argument whenever she does this and I don't like fighting we have a good relationship minus this . She then told me if it was such a big deal then cancel the card and get a new one without her. I said ya that's what I'm going to do because I'm tired of her snooping and lecturing me on spending MY money. She then said forget it and stopped texting me. I'm just waiting for later when dad calls to defend her like always. So AITA for yelling at her and telling her I'd cancel the account so she can't see it?\n\nEdit: Ok guys so gonna clear up some things. 1. The card is in my name my mom did get it when I was 13 and in her name then, when I was 18 we put it in my name as the carrier. Because the way her bank works I guess despite me being the primary she can still see cause she opened it at least that's what she has told me. \n2. This is not the first time this has been argued. When I was in college this happened and we had a blow out she agreed to stop. But when I moved back home she resumed and this fight kept happening. I gave up on the argument for awhile cause I just didn't want to deal with it I just snapped this time. It was building for awhile. Yes 3.I understand if I had just switched banks this wouldn't have happened but i was worried about the fall out and if my mom would just not get over it and hold it over me forever and didn't want to lose our relationship over something like this.\n\nI have also taken in everyone's opinions and thank you for them even if you think IATA. I understand this could have been avoided if I changed my bank but I'll admit I'm the optimist and was hoping she'd stop when I asked even though it was multiple times. My own fault and I am definitely changing my bank this week. Not excited about the fall out because I'm sure she'll guilt trip me when she finds out I move my funds but hopefully it will be 1 fight and when it ends this all just stops.

My son was an authorized user on a card i opened and he had no credit profile until he opened a card of his own.", "Oh I completely agree.", "The healthcare law? No. No it is not.", "If she doesnt use the one she has now, that would certainly work.   Mom is doing much more then covering both rears.   Shes snooping.  She judging. She trying to control her daughter---who is 23!!!!", "Of course, which is why I was saying to get a new credit card.  However, her mother was also using her access at the bank to snoop into her daughter's account.", "Mom\u2019s name is also on the card, which means this card factors into mom\u2019s credit score. She\u2019d be crazy not to keep an eye on it. Frankly, she should insist that her daughter cancel it and get a new card. Then, everyone will be happy.", "That\u2019s not what I got from the post. Op should clarify if mom was monitoring through the bank or through all the cards and accounts they shared", "Where was that in the post?", "The reason many parents add their children to their CC is to increase their credit history; if OP doesn't open a new CC before the current one is cancelled then she's shooting herself in the foot & losing years of credit reporting from that card alone. Replace then remove her name from the account is the smart way to go.", "Mom is not just checking the total and making sure it gets paid.   She is checking where her daughter spends money and then lecturing her about it.   Cancelling the card, solves it all.  Mom doesnt have to worry about her credit rating, and daughter doesnt have to worry about controlling mom.", "More than likely mom is the legal party if card was opened when OP was 13. Mom should cancel but won't. Op just needs to remove themselves and get their own", ">And she's always watched my spending **from work** and would tell me or make a comment about it whenever I spent more than she thought I should or didn't approve of what I bought.\n\nBolding mine.", "Third sentence.", "You are completely ignoring the OP history. Yeah, the mother is heavy handed, but it looks like she has her reasons. They need to get their own cards.", "But she would be logging into her own account....", "Her bad spending history doesnt give mom the right to behave this innsppropriately.  If mom doesnt trust her, mom should have cancelled the card.   Im not ignoring her history, and while it gives mom an excuse, it certainly doesnt give her a reason.", "I agree with you.", "I think this falls more on OP to cancel her card. Doesn\u2019t make it right, but bitching about a situation she could solve in roughly 5 minutes seems odd."]}
