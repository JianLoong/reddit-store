Long story short my youngest son (24 years old) is excitedly planning his wedding. Our family is fairly well to do and my children, even as adults (some with children of their own) are somewhat spoiled. I (their father) like spoiling them. They are good people and deserve it.\n\nHowever, Jason (not his real name) has always struggled both academically and especially socially. He's gay and we live in a particularly conservative area, so he's had a rough go of it. I will also say not all of the family agrees with Jason's lifestyle, both immediate and distant. That in and of itself has led to a lot of conflict. Naturally, I try to stay out of it, but that isn't always possible.\n\nAnyways, along comes my son's first and only partner Alex (29 years old). They officially met a little over a year ago, though it sickened me to learn that they first began communicating years ago through a prison pen pal program. While Alex is quiet and polite in person he is large, heavily tattooed, and is undeniably intimidating. He also has a mile long record, some of it containing physical offenses. A large portion of the family refuse to be around him. He frightens them. \n\nAlex has recently proposed and much to my displeasure, Jason said yes and is beyond delighted. Because his siblings have gotten beautiful weddings which I footed the bill for, I'm not surprised that Jason came to me asking about a budget. The thing is, I can't in good conscience approve of this wedding. I swore I'd be there. I wouldn't miss it. I'll support Jason the best way I can, but I simply do NOT approve and I will not pay for something I am so terribly against.\n\nI wouldn't go as far as to say Jason was distraught at this turn of events, though he was quite devastated. I think a lot of things were said on both our sides that we regret. Me being an asshole was definitely said. I will say, the rest of the family agrees with me. None of us want Alex around. None of us like him.\n\nThe unfortunate side effect of all this is Jason alienating himself from the rest of us. He's gone stone cold no contact with his siblings. Our texts have been few and far between and very impersonal. I've tried calling. No answer. I've tried going to his job site. He doesn't want to see me. I've gone to his place where he currently resides with Alex. The lights are on, yet they act like nobody is home.\n\nThe family blames Alex for this behavior. It's what abusers do, so the selfish part of me wants to blame Alex as well. I'm not entirely convinced though. I still have Jason's voice ringing in my ears telling me I'm an asshole.\n\nAm I?", "created_utc": 1700781775, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/182dsx4/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_sons_wedding_even/", "score": 164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's weird satellite information, and kind of sets up you viewing him as an \"outlier\" among your children. I guess I would say N T A if it's true what you say that you would pay for a wedding to someone without a critical record. But I have a hard time believing it, because you say you \"stay out of\" your family not approving of his sexuality. So how are those family members going to say about you paying for his entire gay wedding? Would you stand up to them then?\n\nSomething's funny here, and I don't believe that this has everything to do with your son's choice in partner. I do think you have some very valid concerns about his partner, however you are alienating your son from your family just as much as his partner might be by treating his relationship differently than you do your other childrens' - further establishing him as an outlier.\n\nEdit: also, being gay is not a lifestyle and if you aren't homophobic as you so frequently claim then you should probably stop using language that reinforces homophobic beliefs.", "> I will also say not all of the family agrees with Jason's lifestyle, both immediate and distant.

You just pushed him away from a support system and further towards his abuser. Congratulations. Of course your son doesn't take your concerns seriously. You do not stick up for him against the homophobia. You think it is acceptable, natural even, to try and stay out of it. What we accept we endorse. And he will see this as further homophobia from you not real concern. If you are right, if Alex is dangerous. You creating the kind of situation where your concerns come off as homophobia and are so easily ignored is your fault, and that action has lead to danger", "NTA\n\nI suspect i'll get downvoted for this but I couldn't care less.\n\nParents always want the best for their children and if this was a younger child in high school I don't think anyone would judge a parent for them telling their children they can't be with someone that has a police record, especially one that suggests physical violence.\n\nAnd sure, you get less control over their life as they get older, they get to make their own choices and you can't stop them.  But I think the biggest thing people get wrong is that you have to accept that.  I'm not the kind of person to say that I am going to love my kids no matter what they do in life.  If they become a criminal, if they become some heartless person who doesn't care about others, I would gladly sit them down and tell them if they don't make changes, I would cut them out of my life.\n\nI would say that who they marry could be included in that.\n\nNow I'm not saying that someone who went to jail is a bad person, it depends on a lot of context.  But if someone has been convicted of crimes and has a violent history, I don't feel like I need to give them a chance.  And the fact that your son met this guy while he was still in prison, doesn't give me much hope.", "Who\u2019s the abusers? Because from your story it sounds like you and the rest of the family. Manipulative behavior is manipulative behavior. That\u2019s what you all are doing right now. Alex has done nothing wrong but love your son, be big, and have tattoos.

He is better of without his AH family", "**YTA**   You may have some grounds for concern, they don't justify you using your money to disfavor him.   You haven't cited anything abusive that Alex has done to either your son or anyone else since he's been present in your son's life.   You don't like his appearance and you've created an entire negative narrative because of that.   \n\nThe fact that the family blames Alex for the fact that the son you've slighted doesn't want anything to do with you is disingenuous.  Jason hasn't alienated himself, you have alienated him. You should also remember that if in fact Alex were to become abusive, you've pretty much ensured that you and your family would be the *last* people Jason would go to.   Is that what you want, for him to be totally without any kind of support?  That's not going to bring him back to the fold.\n\nYou need to communicate with Jason.   Send him a message to say that you need to talk; not to convince him of anything but to affirm your relationship as his father.", "Is Alex the reason why if you refuse \n,because your child is marrying a convicted felon, then I kind of get it and a year together is a short time.

It's fine to be concerned, but concern doesn't warrant dropping your son like this.", "YTA. Even if Alex is an abuser, you just helped isolate your son.

Now you might have lost a son over it.", "Here\u2019s the thing.  Either Alex will have reformed and be a great partner or he will go back to his old ways and your son will realize he made a mistake.  In either case, you want your son to have you there for support.  If you refuse this wedding, you will either miss out on a great relationship with them or  your son will be in a situation that he needs you and not turn to you.", "The real problem here is that Jason and Alex have only been dating for less than a year. That is too soon to be getting married.. And Jason is only 24 and this is his first relationship. At this point it doesn\u2019t matter if Alex has a record or if they are gay. It\u2019s Jason\u2019s inexperience and immaturity. You say he has never had the best judgment and he is rushing this relationship. Also Alex has only been out of prison for a year and he also rushed into a relationship with someone he only knew as a pen pal.\n\nTalk to Jason and apologize. Let him know that you will give Alex a chance and you will pay for the wedding BUT only after they have been together for at least two years. I don\u2019t know the timeline of your other children\u2019s relationships, or if they were less than one year, but most couples are together much longer before they get married. \n\nIf Jason and Alex truly have a relationship that will last forever, waiting another year or even two before they get married is a fair compromise. They can live together, come up all the family gatherings, and Alex will be welcomed. But rushing a wedding, an expensive one at that, is not wise under any circumstances for either of them.", "I was on Jason's side until I got to the prison pen-pal program. NTA.", "NTA. Most of the people calling you an asshole are glossing over the fact that this guy has spent time in prison. The fact that your son struggled academically and socially and was a pen pal with a guy in prison is a huge red flag. This dude is dangerous, and will take advantage of your son. He probably already has. You and your family could be more accepting of who he loves....but not this guy.", "YTA\n\nYou're clearly homophobic. There is no staying out of it when your family is being homophobic to your child, unless you agree with the homophobia. For that and that alone, you are an AH. And a terrible parent.\n\nI can understand why you wouldn't want your child to marry someone with a violent criminal record. But it is almost impossible to distinguish between what you consider dangerous, and just your blatant homophobia. I'm going to be generous and say it's a mixture of the two.\n\nIf you are genuinely worried about your son, you're handling it entirely wrong by pushing him away. If the only things you have to say to prove that his fiance is dangerous is that he has been convicted of crimes and looks a certain way, then you're also a snob as well as a hypocrite. Your behaviour is more than enough reason for him to cut all contact with you, that doesn't automatically mean he is being abused.\n\nIf you want any kind of relationship with your son, get your backwards ideas out of your head. Apologise for the homophobic and classiest slurs you undoubtedly hurled at your son and his fiance. And hope that he *might* forgive you. If you won't pay for the wedding, that's your choice. It's your money. It's completely unfair and just another example of your prejudice, but you're legally allowed to distribute money as you see fit.\n\nPeople are not always in prison because they are bad people. Circumstances, environment and police attitudes dictate who goes to prison and who doesn't far more than a desire to commit criminal activity. If you ever took the time to get to know this man, you might discover that he is determined to change his future, but likely can't because of people like you, judging solely on the past. But that would require you to stop being so judgemental. People *can* change. Him, and you as well. Get off your high horse. You don't have the moral high ground you seem to think you do. Try to be a halfway decent parent, or leave your son alone.", "NTA. If you son was marrying a woman or guy anyone with a violent history is bound to cause red flags amongst family. I do hope you raised these concerns to him when they first started seeing each other. You should try to communicate better with your son. Try to get his siblings to talk with him as well about their concerns with his partner.", "You've provided no evidence to suppose the idea of Alex being an abuser. From your own description it sounds like you are put off by his physical appearance, do not like the fact that he has a criminal record, and leave open the possibility that you're not supportive due to him being gay (this isn't clear, but you do make it clear that some members of the family are against this).   \n\n\nUnless previous restrictions were set on the siblings and you required final approval of their spouse then Jason has every right to be upset and feel alienated. Alex hasn't caused this, you have. Based on your description it seems he had every reason to believe that he'd be granted the same consideration as his siblings. When it comes down to it, you're refusing to pay for his wedding because he didn't make the choices you think he should have made.  \n\n\nUltimately it's your money and you have every right to spend it how you wish.

Long story short my youngest son (24 years old) is excitedly planning his wedding. Our family is fairly well to do and my children, even as adults (some with children of their own) are somewhat spoiled. I (their father) like spoiling them. They are good people and deserve it.\n\nHowever, Jason (not his real name) has always struggled both academically and especially socially. He's gay and we live in a particularly conservative area, so he's had a rough go of it. I will also say not all of the family agrees with Jason's lifestyle, both immediate and distant. That in and of itself has led to a lot of conflict. Naturally, I try to stay out of it, but that isn't always possible.\n\nAnyways, along comes my son's first and only partner Alex (29 years old). They officially met a little over a year ago, though it sickened me to learn that they first began communicating years ago through a prison pen pal program. While Alex is quiet and polite in person he is large, heavily tattooed, and is undeniably intimidating. He also has a mile long record, some of it containing physical offenses. A large portion of the family refuse to be around him. He frightens them. \n\nAlex has recently proposed and much to my displeasure, Jason said yes and is beyond delighted. Because his siblings have gotten beautiful weddings which I footed the bill for, I'm not surprised that Jason came to me asking about a budget. The thing is, I can't in good conscience approve of this wedding. I swore I'd be there. I wouldn't miss it. I'll support Jason the best way I can, but I simply do NOT approve and I will not pay for something I am so terribly against.\n\nI wouldn't go as far as to say Jason was distraught at this turn of events, though he was quite devastated. I think a lot of things were said on both our sides that we regret. Me being an asshole was definitely said. I will say, the rest of the family agrees with me. None of us want Alex around. None of us like him.\n\nThe unfortunate side effect of all this is Jason alienating himself from the rest of us. He's gone stone cold no contact with his siblings. Our texts have been few and far between and very impersonal. I've tried calling. No answer. I've tried going to his job site. He doesn't want to see me. I've gone to his place where he currently resides with Alex. The lights are on, yet they act like nobody is home.\n\nThe family blames Alex for this behavior. It's what abusers do, so the selfish part of me wants to blame Alex as well. I'm not entirely convinced though. I still have Jason's voice ringing in my ears telling me I'm an asshole.\n\nAm I?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA 10000%....Let me give you a different perspective.  You say you are concerned for Jason's wellbeing, yet had no problem standing aside while family on both sides and the neighborhood abused him both mentally and emotionally for years, because they don't agree with how and who he loves. You say you want the best for him, yet you pull your support because of what Alex looks like and might do, yet you make no effort to get to know that someone in the first place. You can't even tell us what is on this horrific rap sheet his partner has. You alienate your son and his partner instead of getting to know them both in that relationship and actually see the dynamic between them. You want him safe, yet push him away, call his partner basically unworthy and guarantee that if something happens and Jason is in danger or gets hurt, that he will have NO ONE to be there for him.  He certainly won't call you. You have already made it clear all these years that you \"stay out of it,\" of course. None of the family likes Alex? None of your arrogant, judgemental, opinionated family has even bothered to get to know him. He is big and scary?? FFS grow up. You are supposed to be adults. He won't answer the door? Why should he? The only thing you have given him is pain and grief. You have made it plain that if he doesn't play by your rules and love someone you and the family approve of, then he doesn't matter, and you will let the family harpies have at him once again. Why would he purposely put himself through that again? Disgraceful parenting. You are supposed to love and protect your children, not throw them in the tigers pit and try to stay out of it. WTH is wrong with you? Why not Dad up and go have a real conversation with Jason AND Alex both and lay out the concerns face to face. If Alex loves your son, then I am sure he would welcome the ability to answer questions. If done in a RESPECTFUL manor, i am sure he wouldn't mind any question you care to ask.\nI wish I could give both Jason amd Alex a big hug.", "You are the asshole.", "YTA\nNuff said", "NTA. I don't know  why you are getting all the hate?  It sounds like a gold digger situation, are people saying just because he's gay he can't be a gold digger?  Damn people are way too PC to the point of being ignorant. He didn't say he had a problem with the gay stuff, he doesn't like a felon preying on a dimwitted child.", "I\u2019m going to say YTA, and honestly this sounds like years of your son struggling to find a community and people who support him. I say this because you mention in the post how family both immediate and distant, and then say you try and stay out of it. This seems to me a father who doesn\u2019t stand up for his son. You might say you support him but you don\u2019t have his back when I read this. To me this is why he found someone like Alex, and has decided to make him his new family.", "This one is a bit complicated. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d run and call you an asshole, but it\u2019s not looking good. It\u2019s super easy to interpret that as homophobia, even if it isn\u2019t. Just in how it\u2019s written. And I get the concern with the past. Shitty young people often become shitty old people, but at the same time, there is a mutual effort here. If Alex isn\u2019t doing anything to give you concern, then what\u2019s the big deal? Let him prove he can grow and change. 20 years ago we were all very different people. I couldn\u2019t have made it where I am without people willing to look past my blemishes.\n\nYour inability to see past Alex\u2019s are on you. Not him. If he\u2019s walking the walk, it\u2019s your job to recognize that. How is he at holiday parties? Is he actively trying to mingle? Is the only thing that intimidates the family the knowledge that he has a record? If you didn\u2019t know about the record would you see him differently? Is he pursuing an education? Working?\n\nI will say, by ostracizing him for his record you\u2019ve unwittingly incentivized him to return to a life of crime. Backfire effect. \u201cWhy should I try if they will never see me as anything but a criminal?\u201d\n\nLike I said. I\u2019m not gonna call you an asshole\u2026 yet. But you do owe your son an apology. Probably Alex too. But whether or not you pay for the wedding. That\u2019s on you to decide, but once you do there\u2019s no going back.", "YTA.\n\nHere's the thing.  If you were afraid of abuse, this isn't the response to it.  If a loved one is in an abusive relationship,it doesn't matter whether they are married.  You also don't solve it by alienating yourself from them.\n\nOn the other hand, if you were homophobic, not paying for wedding but \"support\" is the response.  If you aren't homophobic, the way you treat your son is to defend him to rest of family and alienate them.  You don't \"stay out of it\".\n\nYou can keep saying you aren't homophobic until you are blue in the face, but actions speak louder than words.", "YTA. He\u2019s polite and friendly to you and none of you like him because he\u2019s big and gay. The whole staying out of it thing is a red flag. It\u2019s your job as a parent to support your child in coming out and to defend them against homophobia. It\u2019s clear YOU don\u2019t approve of his \u201clifestyle\u201d and that\u2019s why you\u2019re not paying for the wedding. If he were marrying a woman you don\u2019t care for you\u2019d be footing the bill.", "YTA for the fact that you \u201ctry to stay out of it\u201d when your family subjects your child to homophobia. My step child is LGBTQ and absolutely nobody, family or not, is going to treat them poorly because of that without me making them regret it.\n\nHave you ever considered that maybe part of the reason Jason has struggled academically and socially is because his family is discriminating against him and treating him badly due to his sexuality and even his own father just sits by and lets it happen? And then to have the nerve to say that his fianc\u00e9 is an abuser? you need to take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror because right now you\u2019re an abject failure of a parent and don\u2019t deserve the title of father.", "Jason is really going to need you, whether he marries Alex or not.  Jason needs to know, clearly, that however life shows up for him, you are there for him. And if he\u2019s married or in a  relationship, find a way for you (and your spouse; do you have a spouse or partner?) to have them over for meals\\*, hanging out, watching Netflix, going out to a movie or something, meals and hanging out with you at your house.\n\n\\*It would be a good idea to make sure these meals are based on foods Jason and Alex really like.\n\nAnd now for the chess-game lesson. If you have a conversation/confrontation with Jason like you say you did, what would you think is the next phase in the chess game? He\u2019d go no contact. Some of our relationships are like chess. Please tap into that and think about potential future shifts that relate to what you say and do. You implied that some family members are not against Jason being gay, getting married, or something.  How about building on that. I\u2019m betting there\u2019s quite a history of Jason feeling like he was at a disadvantage and at the mercy of the group of siblings and relatives. See if you can encourage/manage change of that pattern. It will take some doing - loads of repeats of the new paradigm, or else.   That\u2019s \\_If\\_ anyone gets a chance to get back into Jason\u2019s life.", "I can understand if you don't want to support a potentially abusive relationship, but how you write your post I wonder how supportive you and the rest of the family have been to Jason over the years.\n\nHave you clearly shown that you support and side with him when people have been giving him a tough time for being gay? Shown that he is just as loved and valued even if he is not as successful academically and socially?\n\nIf Jason goes NC with the whole family I doubt it is just because of not funding the wedding or even the disapproval of Alex. I think your family has a long history of treating him differently.\nI hope I'm wrong, but that is what I take from your post.\n\nESH seems to be the vote I'm leaning towards.", "YTA.  You haven't been there for him when he's needed you and now you're not being there for him like you were with your other kids.

You'll either come up as homophobic or as prejudistic against Alex and by extention towards Jason.

NAH", "I\u2019m leaning towards YTA. From the way you\u2019ve described the fianc\u00e9 I can understand why you wouldn\u2019t approve of him, but your son probably takes your disapproval of his fianc\u00e9 as a disapproval of him and his sexuality. Especially when you payed for the other siblings weddings AND he\u2019s already faced homophobia from his community and from his own family which you say you want to stay out of (side eyeing that\u2026). I could even bet some of the other family members disapproving of the fianc\u00e9 are just using him as an excuse because they were homophobic all along.", "I spent years I truly loved working in high-violence neighborhoods where many people had a record.  The colleague I respected the most -- from the neighborhood -- always insisted there is an important distinction between crimes that hurt people and all other types of illegal activity.\n\nI think the commenters blaming homophobia are missing the point here.  OP should be able to express concern for his adult child without being slurred.  He's here asking because he's trying to do right by his son and \"right\" in this case is legitimately murky.\n\nIf something terrible should happen in the future, how bad would he feel for not having tried to send a wake-up call?

All best to you and your son, OP.", "YTA\n\nBy \u201cstaying out of it\u201d you are implicitly implying that you agree with everyone who is bullying your son. Put your foot down.

I bet you\u2019ll be amazed at how many have a change of heart once you threaten to close your checkbook. \n\nAs for Alex, the quickest way to get your kid to marry someone is to tell them not to.

YTA, OP", "One things prisons do is rehabilitation, working to help prisoners re-integrate with the community in a productive way. Maybe Alex has genuinely turned over a new leaf, OP isn't giving him a chance.", "I hope that was sarcasm\u2026.I can\u2019t tell for sure.  But this is what I came to say. He isn\u2019t supporting the son against the homophobic family he is passively letting them hurt and ostracize the son. \n\nSo add to it that all the other kids had paid weddings I totally get how it is seen as being unfair. \n\nAnd read the room, Alex is NOT the reason you can\u2019t get a hold of your son. He has gone no contact as you are not being supportive, you have pretty much said you don\u2019t agree with the wedding based on not funding it. And based on the tone of the post you may have actually told Jason you don\u2019t approve.  I\u2019m thinking your attitude toward Alex (and comments from family) was already an issue before this.", "He calls it a lifestyle, that itself is not supportive, just to clarify I am adding to your comment not disagreeing.", "he literally said hes their father\u2026 bye lmfao", "If I believed someone was a potential danger to my child, ESPECIALLY my daughter, I'd be finding a way to get rid of them. Gender of the person doesn't matter.", "um bud, he is not the AH for refusing to pay for his son to marry a convicted abuser. yall are acting like he didnt do anything wrong\u2026 HE ABUSED SOMEONE. if he said he wouldnt pay because hes gay thatd be a completely different story and he would be 100% homophobic. but thats not the reason at all. its sad that you think he should support his son being with an ABUSER.", "Agreed", "Got time to give cookies and trophies but not read a post you are giving your opinion on LMAO.", "if he did horrible things then op doesnt have any obligation to give him a chance. once you do things like that, you give up any right of people giving you a chance.", "I was definitely being sarcastic! Dude's a heel. I wish his son the best and hope for a loving and fulfilling marriage and future NC with his trashbag family", "That comment only works if I had said how you had time to do something. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You're just as bad as OP. Alex hasn't demonstrated violent or abusive tendencies that OP has seen. The system decided Alex was safe to interact with the public, in correspondence and as someone released from prison. People can and have changed, they're not fixed into past personas.\n\nThe real question is why Jason feels safer with Alex than with his family. That's where rehabilitation is needed, the people who pushed their flesh and blood away.", "I see reading is not your strongest trait.", "its obvious he doesnt have a problem with his sexuality and isnt being homophobic. no, saying hes not gonna get between it isnt right because thats his kid, he should get between it but thats not blatant homophobia. and thats not the issue. the son started pushing op away when he said he wouldnt pay for the wedding and said why he wouldnt pay for it. if your daughter was about to marry a convicted offender would you literally pay for the wedding? you would pay for your daughter to marry a convicted abuser? i wouldnt.", "I can see your family wants nothing to do with you since you're so hostile and angry \ud83d\ude15", "I would question why my daughter reached out to and felt a convict appropriate for a confidante. Did she not have people in her life she trusted? How did the environment and people of her upbringing lead to this?", "\u201cHostile and angry\u201d \ud83e\udd23 nothing in their comment shows hostility or anger. Yours on the other hand shows the exact opposite. Were you looking in a mirror when you wrote that comment \ud83d\ude02"]}
