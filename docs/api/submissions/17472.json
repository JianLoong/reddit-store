I drive 90 mins there / 90 mins back everyday. I don't mind it, it can be nice to just drive and be with my thoughts, but the mileage and the fuel make it very expensive.\n\nI'm on a decent salary, worked here for 7 months. I've learned quickly and had chance to have some input into the business (mainly improvements to internal systems etc) but I wouldn't be client facing for another 2 - 4 years.\n\nMy dad has just told me he wants me to move back home in July, which would involve me giving up my life in this city, including my relationship. When I said I'd never get to see my friends, he said \"just make new ones\". My girlfriend and I want to move in together and this demand has put that in jeopardy, which she is upset about. I've said I'm more than willing to commute for another year and then move, even increasing my hours in the interim etc, but I'm not ready to uproot myself and commit all my assets and my life to the family business yet.\n\nHe suggested I buy a house somewhere half way, and he'd loan me money to do it. But I don't want to commit to buying this early on if it isn't where I want to be. It would require all the money I have, plus a financial obligation to my dad.\n\nIn response to me not moving, he's told me I have to leave my job. He's angry at me for it and has brought up all the sacrifices he has made (none of which I was told about til now) to give me this career. \n\nI don't know if this is something I want to commit to for the rest of my life yet. I want control of my own career and my life outside of work - I don't want to be the \"son of\" who is bound by golden handcuffs.\n\nHe gets angry and bombards me with long texts late at night (including work nights) - this time is no different. He texted me last night saying he does not believe my relationship will work out (he believes my girlfriend has manipulated me), I am throwing it all away for no good reason and I won't survive in the challenges of a \"normal\" job. He said I'd be up against people such as him who are \"highly determined and take no prisoners\". He doesn't believe I can nor should do it make my own way.\n\nTo add background, I've been groomed for the family business since I was 14. I did economincs/finance at university and took extra qualifications at the same time so I could get a head start, instead of doing computer science (what I wanted to do) - yet he says I have made zero sacrifices.\n\nI understand my dad's frustration, but I have no wish to fall out with him. I see this as an opportunity that was well intentioned, but due to his impatience and his need/want to retire, it isn't working out. I don't blame him for that.\n\nHowever, I feel I have been forced into committing my whole life to his business only 7 months in. I'm at a crossroads, but I am leaning towards leaving (even if I'm being forced anyway).\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684327885, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13k0vgi/aita_for_not_moving_house_for_the_family_business/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or if you move closer, will you be expected to drop everything you are doing to rush in to work?\n\n>he's told me I have to leave my job.\n\nWell then, I guess you need to look for a job closer and go back to school for computer science. Ultimatums are a way for someone to control you. He's trying to control your life.", "NTA\n\n\nBut this can't go on. You need a job for a normal employer, one who does not complicate things with  all these emotional manipulations.

Start looking for a new job in your city.  You sound like you're highly qualified and need to establish your own independence.", "NTA. Go get a job away from him, even if you do eventually run the family business, you should be exposed to other work environments before that happens. It will make you a better leader when/if the time comes.", "Easy solution if you do want to work for him. You are being asked to give up your entire world for an alleged promise to take over the business. Your dad claims to be a \"highly determined and take no prisoners\" guy. So do that. Talk to a lawyer, get him or her to write up a contract. That if you do X, you get Y. As an example, for every year of work, you get 5% of the business. If you are fired, you get cashed out immediately. I'd be a dick and include a clause that if he disputes the contract later, he has to pay your legal costs. Have an minor up front stake as well. Make sure notarized and any other advice the lawyer tells you. Keep multiple copies, including a scanned copy in the cloud.\n\nIf he says no, tell him his decision is accepted and walk. Because that's what a take no prisoner guy would do, right? If/when he complains, tell him you're only being the businessman he taught you to be. Would he want a son that wasn't highly determined?\n\nUnder NO circumstances should you work for the guy without a contract. You could slave away for years, and then your dad could rug pull you at any moment. Look up the AITA about the plumber guy whose dad gave the company away to someone incompetent. With a contract, you don't have any of those worries. If you get a rug pull, you get paid.\n\nDon't mention it to him, but once you own a stake, you're not just an employee. You're an owner. Even minority share owners have rights. A lawyer can explain them to you. He'll be able to get away with a lot less BS in your life.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't work for the guy period. Your dad sounds like he wants a clone, not a successor. Anything you do that isn't 100% what he would do sounds like it will result in a screaming session. Dude wants you to date who he wants, live where he wants, work where he wants, etc. Screw that. If you want to work with your dad, you need to make it clear he is your employer, not your owner. Do not tell him who you are dating. Don't tell him where you live. Don't tell him how far your commute is. Tell him exactly what you'd tell your boss. That you're there when you are there, and when you're not, it's not his concern. He can whine to the Department of Labor and US Army that slavery was outlawed. Not you. Because that's what a take no prisoners guy would do.\n\nYou'll learn the business working as the owner's son. But you'll have a skewed view. Working for other folks will show you how other companies work and provide frames of reference.\n\nGood luck either way. But this is your life. You are not his property. Act accordingly.", "NTA: Are you doing your job well? Are you using your commute to not finish tasks? Are you late or leave early?\n\nThose are the things he has the right to complain about. He cannot tell any of his employees where they can live or with whom. This includes you. There are tons of posts about family businesses where the owners think their children are indentured servants instead of employees.\n\nIf the commute gets to be too much you could get a crash pad by work for the week and stay with the girlfriend on the weekends. Lots of people have such arrangements. Whatever you do is *your* choice though, not his.", "23 is not too late to go back and study CS. Do that.\n\nStory time: My best friend from school and his dad: his dad, self-made millionaire, insisted son study business to be his successor  - friend was NOT keen (I forget what he did want to study). Dad won, friend studied business, but dad remained a hard-nosed bastard and eventually broke with his son anyway. So there was my friend, never studied what he wanted, had studied and work experinece in a field he did not enjoy, no business to take over, and no dad speaking to him.
