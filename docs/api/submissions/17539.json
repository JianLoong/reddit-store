{"id": 17539, "submission_id": "13ktsom", "title": "AITA for asking my mom where is her money contribution to my wedding", "selftext": "I'll admit the title does sound bad \nI got married to My husband 2 months ago , we saved up for a beautiful big wedding but decided on a small intimate  option. On Friday we had a small intimate ribbon ceremony with a marriage officer and on Saturday we had a beautiful lunch at a farm to table restaurant. In total Friday came to 3k and Saturday came to around 10k, we were completely happy with that because it was a fraction of what we had saved. Before the wedding we made it clear that we didn't want gifts or anyone to pay for themselves but my mother (who I had only recently started talking to 2 months prior to the wedding after going NC for a long time) decided to basically demand that we tell everyone to give us money for the wedding (we did not and ignored her). 2 days before the wedding my Fil gave us 3k we didn't want to take it but he literally put it in my husband's hand and walked away (he does the same thing on my birthday as I always refuse) on the Saturday at  lunch when we had all finished eating and we had cut our wedding cake Fil dissappear and went to pay for all the drinks, so we paid the bill and my mom shouted at us for leaving a tip which is ironic because she's a waitress, reason being is that there was already a 15% service fee because of the amount of people but we still tipped. Mil had gone up to one of our servers and got a copy of the bill, she sent my husband the amount of half the bill (mil also got us our wedding cake) , my dad gave us 2k and we got 1k from My grandma and 1k from his grandma, safe to say no one listened but we were still so grateful and made sure to thank everyone. Issue is my mom had gone behind my back and told everyone that they had to contribute because we couldn't afford the wedding ( we later spoke to everyone about it and they knew it was nonsense and said they were going to give us the money either way, all of them knew where we stood financially because we were very open about it, had we paid completely by ourselves we would still come way under our wedding budget that we saved) after talking to everyone I went to my mom and asked why she went behind my back and demanded people give us money and all she could say was how disappointed she was that \"they all skimped and gave you so little\" so I turned around and asked where was her money contribution to the wedding and it better be thousands the way she's carrying on, this made her angry and she called me a selfish b$tch and an asshole. She's been harassing me over text to apologize but I don't even want to talk to her. \nMy dad said I should apologize to keep the peace (they are no longer together) \nI only asked her where her wedding money was so she would leave me alone \nI'm not mad that she didn't give me money,I'm mad that she demanded everyone else give us money and belittled them on the amounts they gifted us but wouldn't even pay for her 2 friends that she invited without talking to us first . \nAita? Should I apologize?\n\nA quick edit:\n So no one gets the wrong idea. I do not tally up money gifts and compare them, I included amounts in this post because my mother belittled people for how little they gave when in reality everyone was so incredibly generous despite us not even wanting gifts and the  only reason she knew the amounts was because she made it a point to go and ask everyone what they gave us. I did not personally discuss what everyone gave us.", "created_utc": 1684402244, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ktsom/aita_for_asking_my_mom_where_is_her_money/", "score": 310, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
