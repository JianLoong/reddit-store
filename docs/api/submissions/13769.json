He has access to fortnight on all the other systems so the fact he ignored your one wish about gaming is ridiculous. He's lucky you didn't just delete the games and his progress", "Oh no NTA. He broke his own switch, broke your rule of no Fortnite on your switch, and I\u2019m honestly confused why he\u2019d delete data from your currently installed games. He should see consequences for his actions. Hope you get some time to yourself soon.", "NTA.   \nAnd I\u2019d block grandma from visiting. She\u2019s just enabling some very entitled behaviour.   \n13yrs old is absolutely old enough to know what he did. Password the shit out of EVERYTHING and parental lock it all when you give it back, and he has to ask for everything all over again. I\u2019m all for flexible parenting, but trust is earnt.", "NTA\n\nYour child needs to learn to respect peoples \u201cproperty\u201d.  \n\nIF your mother doesn\u2019t support you, go low contact until she stops undermining you", "NTA. Parent the kid, keep the reasonable rules, tell your mom to back off. If my kid uninstalled any of my games without permission and wiped my progress, there would be hell to pay. He's 13 and knows exactly how selfish and unacceptable that was.", "NTA. I would erase any saved game data he has in addition to grounding him from the gaming systems. He needs to know you won't put up with his selfish behavior.", "NTA. Your mom is coddling your son and it will not benefit him in the future. It will certainly not benefit you if he grows up to be an entitled brat. Also, many adults play video games and it\u2019s very close minded to say they are only for children; I don\u2019t get why your mom is belittling your hobbies. You did the right thing by teaching your son that he can\u2019t do things you expressly told him not to do without consequences. ESPECIALLY when he already has Fortnite installed on all his other devices (like come on\u2026)", "NTA. That seems like an entirely appropriate punishment for what he did.", "nta.\n\nGrounding him from games was a good move, too. He knows how unacceptable deleting everything was. If he can't manage those simple rules, he doesn't get the privilege of gaming.  \n\nStand strong against your mom!", "NTA And your mom need to stay out of it. I would be pretty mad if my kid did that.", "NTA he knew exactly what he was doing. There's no reason to have it on your gaming system when he can use other systems to play. Maybe delete his games and progress. He definitely needs to learn respect and responsibility.", "NTA in the slightest! He broke the one rule you had for your switch, which you could've easily denied him access to in the first place. Your punishment was in no way an appropriate cause for such an overreaction on his part. He doesn't need saving from his grandmother because he's been temporarily grounded from playing video games, and maybe (I'm so sorry if this sounds rude) he needs to learn that there are other things in life besides video games, and he should take your privileges into account too. Seriously, you had one rule and he broke it, did he not expect a consequence?", "I had a 13-year-old in a family of gamers, and he would never have done that in a million years. Your kid knew better and made a decision to be a dick. It\u2019s not about gaming, it\u2019s the fact your kid has no respect for you and actively tried to punish you. The fact grandma even thinks of intervening is part of the problem. It\u2019s not her business, and she\u2019s dead wrong. Don\u2019t ever let her undermine you again. Your child doesn\u2019t respect you at all, and sounds like an entitled little shit. Get control of your family now because this only gets worse. Ultimately if a child is choosing to do things they know are wrong, punishment is appropriate. Punishing him is fine, but you need to have a calm discussion about why he is acting this way, otherwise punishment is not enough to correct the behaviour.", "NTA. Grandma needs to stay in her lane and the line about games just being for kids is ridiculous. Boomers played tons of card games, board games, horseshoes...as grown ass adults.", "Absolute NTA.\n\nI'd expect this behaviour from an eight year old, but thirteen? Whilst there's a newborn baby in the house? Unacceptable. The harsh truth is that your kid needs discipline, time away from gaming and a parenting attitude that isn't so soft. You also need to make it clear to your mother that she needs to back off. She isn't the parent anymore, and she doesn't get to dictate how your child is raised. To be frank, she sounds incredibly toxic and overwhelming.", "NTA. I\u2019d have deleted all his saves on top of that.", "NTA I think you are parenting her grandbaby perfectly.  Just because she has no boundaries doesn\u2019t mean you have to. Keep up the good work Mama.", "If she comes to \u201csave the grand baby\u201d, wouldn\u2019t that be kidnapping?", "NTA. Stand your ground on this as you are the mother and he is the son. Your own mother is trying to split you two. Tell her to mind her own business", "NTA!!! you set a clear rule, no fortnite. he broke it, and in the process deleted all of your progress. he does not get to be upset for facing the consequences of his own actions. my brother is 12, big gamer, and absolutely knows what \"delete save data\" means. it even should give you a prompt. it was on purpose and your mother is enabling him.", "NTA. You need to move further away from the grandparents' sphere of influence.", "NTA I'd send him to grandma if she wants him. Sounds like they deserve each other right now.", "NTA. Delete his fornite account", "NTA im 33 with a 13yr old and we both love gaming i have rules my kid knows to ask before deleting and no, means no. Your kid ran to grandma because grandma spoils him and gives him what he wants no doubt by her reaction. I would say grandma is the biggest problem and you cant fix the kids problem with out fixing the grandma problem.", "NTA, if he cant respect the rules of using someone else's property, then he can deal with the consequences.  Grandma also needs to know her role.  If she's so badly concerned then she can buy a new switch.", "NTA but I hope you can get his screen addiction under control.  Does he have chores he has to do?  How about making him earn game and phone time?", "NTA but have you checked for cloud saves? I assume so but just in case it\u2019s possible your data isn\u2019t totally lost.", "NTA. \nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes.\n\nAlso games are meant for kids? Man, have the games I had as a kid I got stuck in all the time. I didn't have the hand eye coordination or the mental ability for some of the puzzles.\n\nI'm 35F and my wife is 33. We both play games still. It's a stress reliever and has been proven to help stave off things like, oh you know, dementia and Alzheimers disease. Keeps your brain active you know", "NTA. Moreover, Gramma needs a time out.", "You-re the parent not your mom. Act like it..but\n\nNta - kid is spoiled\n\nAlso look up ways to recover your progress through cached memory. It also just a game not the end of the world however take control of your responsibilities.
