Also, many adults play video games and it\u2019s very close minded to say they are only for children; I don\u2019t get why your mom is belittling your hobbies. You did the right thing by teaching your son that he can\u2019t do things you expressly told him not to do without consequences.

Your child doesn\u2019t respect you at all, and sounds like an entitled little shit. Get control of your family now because this only gets worse. Ultimately if a child is choosing to do things they know are wrong, punishment is appropriate. Punishing him is fine, but you need to have a calm discussion about why he is acting this way, otherwise punishment is not enough to correct the behaviour.", "NTA.

Boomers played tons of card games, board games, horseshoes...as grown ass adults.", "Absolute NTA.\n\nI'd expect this behaviour from an eight year old, but thirteen? Whilst there's a newborn baby in the house? Unacceptable. The harsh truth is that your kid needs discipline, time away from gaming and a parenting attitude that isn't so soft.
