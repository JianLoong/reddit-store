Your child doesn\u2019t respect you at all, and sounds like an entitled little shit. Get control of your family now because this only gets worse.

I\u2019m in my mid-40s (and in a professional career) and I recently put over 100 hours into Persona 5 on my (very well used) Switch and I\u2019m now back on Pok\u00e9mon Arceus.  Anyone who wants to tell me that\u2019s just for kids is getting no airtime in my house.  \n\nHOWEVER, I think you need to think long and hard about how you\u2019ve ended up with a, by your own admission, \u201cvery spoiled\u201d kid.  That doesn\u2019t happen by accident - you have spoiled him and you need to start working on undoing that.", "NTA\n\nHe did hurt someone. You. I would be devastated if I lost my Stardew progress. That is hours of work, decorating, and luck-based finds that you can\u2019t get back. All because your son decided to willingly break your one rule regarding YOUR device. He did so because he didn\u2019t care about your wants or feelings. I can assure you if it was his data that got erased he\u2019d be much more upset. \n\nYou clearly have your hands full at home and he is not making it better. He needs to learn accountability and a temporary ban from his devices isn\u2019t a bad punishment in comparison. Good on you for sticking to your guns, and your mother needs to stop enabling his bad behavior. I\u2019d advise you don\u2019t allow him over her house for the foreseeable future if at all possible. Also, it\u2019s her that needs to grow up. I can\u2019t imagine she never had a time she had to discipline any of her children, and not having to actively raise kids has apparently blinded her to the realities of child-rearing.\n\nGood luck. You\u2019ve got this.", "YTA only because you've tolerated your son being so spoiled and entitled for this long.  \n\nHe knew what he did was wrong, and then threw a tantrum when you confronted him and let him know the consequences of his actions.", "NTA. You are the parent. You get to discipline him. As you said, he's spoiled. He gotta learn to respect boundaries. Now he knows how it feels if someone deletes their games lol", "NTA. First off you need to set boundaries with your mother. She has no business intruding on your parenting unless you are actually causing harm to your child. You are simply showing the kid that actions have consequences.\n\nI wouldn't let him use your switch again at all. He broke his so how can you trust him with yours? Then he proves you can't trust him with it by deleting all your data. Then he gets angry when you show him his actions have consequences and tattles to grandma? Grandma can stay at her own home until she learns boundaries and he can be without any electronics until he learns to respect your boundaries.", "NTA", "Reminds me of something my cousin did  \nI love training amiibos in SSBU, and anyone who plays SSBU know's that getting enough spirits to make an amiibo optimal as well as getting one to level 50 and it being good is a pain in the ass.  \nWell my cousin asked to play my switch (which was normal) he had 1 rule, do not touch the mode where you access spirits... not only did he do what he was told not to, he deleted/sold every single spirit I had collected, I was so devastated.  \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\n\nThe punishment should fit the crime.

She'll be dropping him off in no time and you can get a small rest.", "Grandma sounds like shes feeding in to his spoiled behavior. You need to have a stern talk with your mother about parental boundaries.\n\nNTA. You didnt do anything wrong, you're literally his mother and he did something you had explicitly told him not to, And he deleted things without permission.", "NTA He was aware of what he was doing and I would question as to why he needed fortnight on your switch. Does he have any save files for a game you can delete? Tell him and grandma that he can get his tech back if you can delete as many files as space he cleared on your switch. Also tell Grandma that she's not his mom and to stop undermining you.\n\nBTW my nephew knew when he was 3 years old not to delete save files", "NTA. It\u2019s a perfectly reasonable punishment for his actions. Video games are a privilege, not a right.", "NTA - he knows what he did AND how rude that was to another gamer.   \n\n\nTime to learn respect for others, respect for property, consequences and who is the parent.

Your mom is an asshole as well for the comment about games being for kids and for making you the bad guy here.", "Some of the OTT reactions on here are funny. I think you did everything right, considering what physical and emotional stress you\u2019re going through. He did a perfect f*ck around and find out.

Therefore can't access the cloud data to replay any games, and teach him about life before consoles lol.", "NTA,  he was very disrespectful. How is your son going to be angry at the consequences when you clearly set a boundary. He wouldn\u2019t like it if you deleted his Fortnite account now would he? \n\nAlso who\u2019s spoiling your son? If it\u2019s your mom then some boundaries need to set with her, she\u2019s only making him increasingly more entitled.

Responsibility hurts to learn at 13, especially with a new baby around.  You should've done this at least 10 years earlier.

I mean, it's cruel, but maybe he needs some prospective on how that feels.", "NTA. Your son knew the rule and still installed Fortnight.

If not, he deliberately went into the system settings to delete that data, either because he's absolutely clueless and has never used a Switch in his life, or because he was being an idiot and did it that way anyway.\n\nThere is no way you're the ah in this.", "Give him to grandma. Once she remembers what living with a teenager is like, she\u2019ll won\u2019t be bothering you again.", "NTA why does he even need to have Fortnite on their as well???
