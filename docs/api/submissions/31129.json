And the thing is it ruins his whole day and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.\n\nFor ex, today he was all day working from home (we both work from home), and he had a bad day at his job so once he stopped working I told him let\u2019s do whatever you want to keep your mind off work, I offered him some plans I know he enjoys but he refused and told me there\u2019s nothing I can do to cheer him up.

Depression is awful and I have my sympathy for your bf but it doesn't sound like he is trying. This is coming from someone with major depression and anxiety. I got to a really bad point, where I was acting just like your bf.. my bf took as much as he could take, then snapped and told me how he really felt. It jolted me, and I realised how miserable I was and how I was making him feel it, too. From that point on, I got more help and vowed I would never get to that point with him again. Even though my depression was the cause, I was still being an AH. And it wasn't an excuse.

There are support groups out there for families impacted by mental health, drug addiction, etc. Therapy is a great idea as well, sometimes it does help to hear from others in a similar boat. \n\nMy ex was similar, he struggled quite a bit. He\u2019d have outbursts and I\u2019d be caught completely off guard. What I found helped was establishing firm boundaries with him. This way I didn\u2019t insult him or criticize his mental health, I focused instead on what I would and would not accept directed at me.

Ironically I was seeing one, and after a year I realized my ex would probably really connect with her instead. I stepped out to give them space, and she worked amazing for him.

As a guy with life changing depression myself (went from class president of my college as a freshman to dropping out senior year after trying it twice), there is a responsibility to try to show up for the relationship and partner even though you\u2019re depressed. It\u2019s part of being grateful, intellectually even if you cant feel it emotionally through the depression. If he is not showing up for you by not making space for you to have bad days too, and by not bringing any enthusiasm to spending time together, I would not blame you for leaving him. \n\nBefore you do, you may want to chat with him about these feelings in more depth to share it all - everything you are feeling - and see if you can find a creative solution. Share appreciation for his loyalty and things you do love about him. And share your tensions, without trying to protect him from it. Then see if he\u2019s willing to help you explore ways to meet your needs too. Maybe for instance a quiet cuddle and music is one way to bond and be together that allows him to put his depression aside (or stuff it down) enough to be there with you in an intimate way.", "NTA.

I really can't see this ending well tbh, and if he's already in therapy and on medication and diagnosed with depression....whether you think it's your place to help or not, you need to be really careful with how you handle this scenario.\n\nAt this stage I would honestly take a few weeks apart from each other and then  re-evaluate where you want this relationship to go.", "NTA He's not putting any effort into fixing his depression. I think you should have a serious talk with him about either having him put in more effort or to get on medication. You sound like you've been doing all of the leg work on this and that's not fair to you. You could absolutely say the same thing back to him about not being able to open up, so he's just being defensive. I absolutely understand not wanting to give up on someone you love because they're giving up on themselves, but if a fire under his butt won't get him to put in some effort then I'm not sure what else you could do to help.", "I don\u2019t think therapy is a bad idea. But you bring up some things that are interesting: a) you say things were perfect in the beginning, b) that he shuts down and c) that he\u2019s bored of therapy.

No amount of understanding what depression is will make you understand why he feels the way he feels because depression isn't logical. You can't think your way out of this. \n\nThe reality is, he is making you suffer. And those years are years you will never get back. You have a sunk cost fallacy that you've already put all of this time and effort into it and if you just put more in it'll fix it. But respectfully, what the f*ck is he doing to make things better for himself, for you, or the relationship? If he truly loved you he would want you to be happy. Instead, when you tell him how you feel he puts it on you as to why it's your fault. You rearrange your days and that's not enough. You cry every day and you don't have to.  \n\nIt will take him years to get this under control. It's taken a year and there's no progress and he's given up. It's going to take him trying medicine and finding a therapist and going to the gym and reading books and finding out how to manage this. He doesn't have to do any of those things right now because he still has you and you make excuses and let him be sad and cater to him at your own expense. \n\nYou do not have to set yourself on fire to warm him! You do NOT want to have kids with him because you will 100% be solely responsible for everything, including the financial support when he quits his next job and stays unemployed while you try and raise kids and pay the bills.\n\nI've dealt with depression on and off my entire life so I'm not saying this to just be mean. The reality is that I've had to have my heart broken by completely falling apart in a relationship because of it.  Sometimes it takes reaching rock bottom in order to actually want the help. And it was painful as the relationship ended and I saw him fall out of love with me. I still couldn't fix it until it was so broken that I had to surrender to it. I then got diagnosed with ADHD and ASD and I've never been healthier now that I understand the underlying issues. \n\nI swear to you there are so many honest and loyal men out there. He's not some unicorn. I'm 40 and I've had at least a dozen serious relationships lasting at least a year. I've been married and divorced.

You're so so young in the broad scheme of things. You can and will find other partners who will treat you amazing and love you more than you've ever been loved.

I have been in therapy for about 10 years and medication 7 , i understand completely what your husband is talking about and the reason of why he is complaining. Honestly people say that they know everything about depression (i don't mean you just in general) when they have no idea what it is like, what it's like not to have the courage to bathe and have your mom undress you to force you, to just stare at the top of stairs looking at the bottom, to not eat, to overeat,to just exist ect. From my mom i know living with a person that is depressed is hard and painful and that you probably do need to talk to his therapist for advice.

Depression is also a major symptom of thyroid issues, many of which can very easily be fixed with medication. He also needs to be discussing this with his primary care Dr.\n-if the depression meds aren't working, he should try different meds. There is no one size fits all medication for depression. Some folks need more dopamine. Some need more serotonin. And some people need both. Finding a combo of meds that work can be a really difficult journey that requires persistence, but that persistence pays off massively when you finally get things right. \n-there are tons of different types of therapy.  If this therapist isn't working for him then he should switch to a therapist that specializes in a different kind of therapy. Sometimes just switching to someone different is really helpful. You need to find someone whose expertise and personality work well with you. Keep in mind though that depression often makes it very hard to talk about your actual feelings, and talk therapy can only go so far.\n-figuring out and treating depression is a long road. It can take YEARS, especially if the depressee is unmotivated to heal. And im not talking 1 or 2. It could be decades. By staying you are signing up for a long and miserable journey that might never end and that you do not have to go on. \n\nHowever you choose to move forward, i wish you the best if luck.", "Similar boat\u2026 it\u2019s hard and lonely.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to relate because I am beyond resilient\u2026 I\u2019ve had no choice so if feels like he chooses to be miserable.", "I have clinical depression and I just want to say: it's not his mental health that making you miserable. \n\nIt's how he manged it. How he doesn't take in help. How he drag everyone down. How he complain about everything. \n\nI've learned how to manage my depression in a way that's healthy to both myself and my loved ones. How to let people in and share in my struggles, without making them feel terrible. How to deal with things that bother my in a productive way. How to not be a jerk about it. \n\nNTA. I don't know why the therapy isn't working, but both of you need to think deep about what kind of relationship you want to have.", "NTA. Maybe losing you will be the jolt he needs to get out of his funk. Not that it's your fault AT ALL. But sometimes two good people can somehow breed toxicity. \nYou two just aren't compatible.", "Nothing is worse than feeling alone in a relationship. \n\nYou can be understanding and empathetic to his situation, but it\u2019s also his responsibility to make an effort to be self aware of how his behaviors impact you. \n\nAs someone who has been chronically depressed since a teen. It\u2019s hard, yes, but when it\u2019s bad, I know I need to turn inwards and do self work- just because I feel bad and sad doesn\u2019t mean I want others to feel the same around me. \n\nMy ex husband is was (is?) severely depressed and I couldn\u2019t love him better or be more accommodating. It was a relief when he wasn\u2019t home and I eventually I dreaded being around him because all he did was complain about everything and it was so draining. \n\nYour mental health is important, too.", "Some of this could be the differences in how you both processes things. And depending on if the depression has shifted how your partner processes things, or is now comfortable enough in the relationship to not mask those feelings / processes. \n\nMy roommate is adopted family. They are a good egg and I love them dearly, but boy oh boy do we process differently. For me optimism and problem solving helps keep me going, for them sitting right down in the awful feels and letting them wash over them for a long stretch is how they navigate. It makes zero sense to me and in the process of trying to help whatever situation is causing the distress to conclude have been met with frustration that I can't just let them feel what they are feeling. And fair enough, how they process things is not my responsibility, but it took ages for it not to hurt as a caring individual to see a loved one basically fold themselves in to each unhappy feeling and hunker down for the duration. \n\nIt's rough, and it sounds like you've been in that groove for a while now of wanting to be as supportive as possible and provide comfort or possible solutions for your partners distress. That is a kind thing you are doing, it's part of your love languages to do that for someone you care for... but maybe recognize it's not part of your partners love languages to engage that way. Maybe have a conversation with him about what things he thinks would help when he hits these moments. Maybe joking around about it, maybe distraction with random memes, maybe curling up together and saying nothing, there's all kinds of ways that you can be that kind and caring partner that more accurately align with what your partner needs / wants. \n\nThis should be a two way street, he should be learning what helps you in rough spots so you feel comfy leaning on him as well. \n\nFor me, it took two years and many conversations before we came round to: I full on engage with shit talking about the situation, agree that it's awful, swap some dark humor about whatever is going on for a period of time and then disengage from it. I.e., we talk, we joke, we bitch and moan, they feel heard and met with their process, and then I go about my day and ignore the situation from there on out as roomie does not want help fixing it but feels cared for because I listened and engaged in their process and then did what I needed to do to not stress out that they're in discomfort. \n\nWhich has had a net positive effect for us that I get stressed out way less and they feel comfortable now requesting help here and there when they are ready to dig back out of the rough feelings. \n\nBut here's the thing: partner has to be willing to find that middle ground with you so you can both feel some level of care and comfort in whatever method is decided. If it's still too much for you how they process stuff, that's fair. I mean my roomie is great family but holy hell there is no way I would date someone with this type of process as it would kill me to see an SO go through this. Part of this is being aware and honest with yourself of what you need and can support in a SO dynamic.\n\nNTA - hoping my long ass ramble helps", "The thing is I know he is trying, but now that he sees no results in a year he thinks it\u2019s not working and just wants to give up\u2026", "He\u2019s in therapy and taking medication. Unfortunately some people have treatment resistant medical issues. You don\u2019t need to paint him as some asshole who\u2019s refusing to help himself.", "Yeah, it\u2019s horrible. We really love each other and it really hurts to see how this thing that I don\u2019t really know how to confront messes everything up. It really fucking sucks.", "He is on medication and he is getting therapy. I don\u2019t know why people are saying he\u2019s not trying. Some people have treatment resistant depression.", "OP\u2019s bf is getting therapy and taking medication. Some mental illnesses are treatment resistant.", "Can i ask you why you decide to stay with him if you are exhausted? What keeps you motivated?", "Can I ask you don't try and spin a narrative like this please, it really isn't healthy. \n\nOP's partner is on medication, clinically diagnosed with depression and also taking part in therapy, all no doubt organised and assessed by a medically trained doctor who is qualified to assess.\n\nThis isn't abuse, OP's partner isn't being abusive and in no way has OP said that their partner is being abusive.", "What do you mean \u201cmy bar is low?\u201d", "OP isn\u2019t obligated to care for him or be with him if it\u2019s harming her or she simply doesn\u2019t want to. Your comment is coercive and incorrect. She is a person and she has needs and deserves them to be met too. She\u2019s not his slave because he has depression.", "I mean, honesty and loyalty are things that I really value in a lifetime partner. I don\u2019t get how that\u2019s selfish?", "Yeah, I agree. I feel like I need to understand depression way more. I want to understand why he feels the way he feels, and how I can be more helpful. Hopefully that reduces my feelings of frustration.", "\"don\u2019t you think ending the relationship will send him on an even worse track?\"\n\nThis is manipulative and akin to people threatening suicide when a partner tries to leave them.\n\nOP is not responsible for bf's mental health and is not obligated to give up their life, happiness, and well-being to cater to his needs and support him forever.", "The thing is I always tell him my concerns and he just answers in a super negative way, he always says he doesn\u2019t know, he wants to give up on everything\u2026 he never says things will be fine, so I don\u2019t have much to hold onto either. I\u2019m still hoping things will improve though\ud83d\ude2d", "This was my thought. I tried multiple meds over the course of several years before I found the right medication and dosage for me. Then my daughter went through the same thing. Taking medication can be a great solution! But taking the wrong medication for your body can make it worse or at least no better.", "I\u2019ve been suicidal since I was 15. Then I got cancer at 19. I think you can guess how well that turned out for me. I\u2019ve got multiple scars on both my arms from when I went hunting for arteries, almost hang myself once, chemo was awful, and still is. Went through years of therapy and 5 different combinations of meds, and I\u2019m only now starting to enjoy life. This may sound harsh, but one year is nothing. Switching therapists, medications, trying out new experimental treatments, there\u2019s always something else to try. Giving up is silly. He needs to accept that life with major depression is not perfect, he will most likely always have depressive episodes, but through treatment and perseverance, he can find something to live for and makes him happy when things are going well, and tolerate existence when he feels like shit. When I have depressive episodes now and I feel like giving up, I just lay in bed for days or weeks, and cuddle with my cats, until I\u2019m able to get up again. If it weren\u2019t for them, I would be dead. \n\nBut none of that is your problem. It\u2019s up to him to force himself to keep going. You need to think about yourself and your future.", "has he tried more than one medication? sometimes you have to try several different ones before you find what\u2019s right for you. if he\u2019s been on the same medication for over 2 months with no improvement, it\u2019s probably time to try something else.\n\ni\u2019ve been on and off meds for about 15 years and some meds didn\u2019t work for me at all, some worked but came with unbearable side effects (usually extreme sleepiness), and now finally i\u2019m settled in with Trintellix, which is classified as an atypical antidepressant and just happens to work better with my particular kind of funky brain chemistry, i guess.", "Well uniquely i'm commenting from the other side.\n\n32 year old male here suffering with mental health, on medication and soon to start private therapy (I love in the U. K and our public mental health  system sucks)\n\nI often feel how you've described your boyfriend feeling. Me and my partner have come close to splitting several times because of it, but we have a disabled child also so it's also more complicated. \n\nThe turning point for me was eventually seeing just how upset I was making my partner, I was literally making her ill with worry every time I left the home unattended etc, made her feel like she couldn't speak without me biting her head off. A switch flipped for me, I need to get better and make positive changes not just for me, but for my family too, my feelings don't just effect me but others around me too. \n\nWe communicate a lot better now, she can see that i'm \"fighting\" so to speak, and in return supports and respects me more.... Win win, we both get what we want. Things have gone from strength to strength.\n\nOP please don't feel guilty for the way you feel. It's absolutely warranted and understandable. \n\nBut ultimately only you know your limits, and if you've gone past your limits and need a break away or to end the relationship, then that's what you need to do. If your heart isn't fully in it, he will pick up on that, and in turn might make him feel worse instead of better.", "Oh I didn\u2019t see that part.", "We are Highschool sweet hearts, I\u2019ve never been with anybody else. We have 3 kids and I just don\u2019t know anything else. Divorcing him would destroy everything we have worked toward. I put up with it and I put up with his shitty family. I know under all that mental illness he\u2019s a good person, a good husband and a good father.  It is exhausting and maybe one day he will pull his head out and he will get the help. Maybe I\u2019m just dumb, I don\u2019t know, like I said I don\u2019t know anything else. I\u2019m a STAHM and don\u2019t get out much.", "Can I ask you not to make OP responsible for her partner's health? It's really unhealthy that you think shitty behavior is excusable if someone is suffering an illness. OP's partner SAYS he is on medication; he SAYS he is going to therapy. Two options: he's lying, or it isn't working. In both situations, OP is not the asshole. However, I think you're a oretty big AH for saying OP can't leave over abusive behavior, because the partner has a diagnosis. Believe it or not, it is possible to hurt people regardless of illness.", "You\u2019re not being abused. Don\u2019t listen to this idiot. But I think you should look out for you. Ask him to explore other therapists and other types of therapy, does he have trauma? Thinking errors? There are all different types of therapy. If he will not seek out different help and it doesn\u2019t improve you should really look out for you and consider leaving. But he\u2019s not abusive at all. Neither of you are assholes.", "He's \"loyal\" (whatever that means? That he's monogamous? Actually not all that hard to find??) and he \"doesn't lie\"? That's not some kind of achievement. That is very basic human stuff. You might be in love, but this guy is not some kind of catch for doing the bare minimum.\n\nFurthermore, since you two moved in together, he's been like this. Let me make this plain: he will always be like this. He says it's depression... but it sounds like all he does is make you miserable, and put the responsibilty for his health and feelings on YOU. It sounds like he's gives a rat's ass about your health and your feelings. I have suffered with depression. I would sooner check myself into a hospital than make my loved ones feel the way your bf makes you feel. Please visit loveisrespect.org because -- kindly -- you have no idea what a healthy relationship looks like. You a white knuckling it, and my deepest desire is that you let this guy go so you can spend all that mental energy on YOU.", "She\u2019s a selfish asshole. Why be in a relationship with someone you don\u2019t care about? And who said anything about slavery? And what makes it coercive? Just trying to hit the crank bingo are we? Just need abusive, trigger and boundary and it\u2019s house.", "I said they are about you, not that they were selfish in and of themselves. But in the broader context of what you\u2019ve said, your concern is entirely how this relationship works for you and how his depression impacts you. And that\u2019s what you\u2019ve communicated to him as well.", "it's hard to give long-term advice since it's so situational but you should know that it's okay to feel frustration. Maybe talk to you therapist and see if couples counseling might help. that way you can get some advice for communicating with each other.", "As someone who has suffered major depression, I ask you to please stop accepting the diagnosis as justification for your bf's shitty behavior. There's no reason to sacrifice your own well-being and mental health for him. A lot of fellow depression survivors on this subreddit are reading their own lives onto your story. Meanwhile, I am also a DV/IPV survivor. I am desparately trying to warn you about the signs... best of luck to you in the future. It seems like you're looking for people to justify your staying; I'd rather see you live life to the full, single or partnered.", "Have you done any research on depression? You know his inability to  see beyond the hopelessness IS  depression. \n\nHis brain will not give him hope. He's not hoarding it. He's not choosing the bad option. His brain is only giving him bad options. His hope is not available right now. He doesn't think things will be fine... because depression. \n\nI don't think you're the AH for feeling the way you do.
