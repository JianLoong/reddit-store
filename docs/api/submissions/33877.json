Reading some of your post history, I see you have a long history of trying to figure out what's going on with your body, in a health care system that's not being as helpful as it should be (oh the joys of being assumed female while trying to nail down mystery health stuff).\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would be getting my ducks in a row to leave safely.\n\nYour husband has demonstrated a series of terrible behaviors and you should take that seriously.\n\nIf you feel safe enough, maybe have a serious conversation about it (with safe friends present or at least nearby) and if he doesn't sincerely apologize and make any changes, then take that as your final sign.\n\nBecause, honestly, it does not matter why he's ignoring your very serious allergies and health issues. He is actively causing you harm by cooking foods you should not be eating and he's leaving you alone while you're having symptoms. Both are awful to do to a loved one.\n\nIt's possible he doesn't really believe it's that bad. It's possible he's resentful of the fact that he has to adjust his life because of your health. A lot of things are possible as to why he's doing this. But as I said before, the whys aren't that important when the end result is potentially deadly harm.\n\nDon't let him kill you: be it on accident or on purpose.\n\nI wish you well and I hope you're able to amass a health care team that's able to figure out all your triggers so you can live a safe life as free from symptoms as possible. Ideally, with a partner that cares enough to help you in that life.", "Why are you guys all dating men who hate you????", "NTA. He knowingly cooks for you using foods you are allergic to?

When someone shows they don't care about you, believe them.", "NTA\n\nAnd you need to leave him before he kills you.  He's deliberately cooking with things he knows you are allergic to.\n\nI would not be surprised if he's deliberately putting something around that is setting off your reaction and you have no idea because you haven't considered this possibility.\n\nHow long have you been together?  It's time to leave.  This is not a nice person.  He's making this worse for you.  That is not what a good partner does.", "Six cats and you have bad allergies?", "NTA. His behavior is a serious offense. He is intentionally trying to make you sick.Failing to note your allergies and failing to take precautions by not using your known allergens is a crime not a silly slip up.

I have a feeling you might need them if his behavior continues unchanged.", "Allergies get worse. Eventually Benadryl won\u2019t be enough to halt the reaction.", "NTA. As someone with life-threatening allergies: A lack of care is a serious concern. When you're in the throes of an allergic reaction, you're vulnerable, physically AND emotionally. I don't expect everyone to \"get it\" fully, but if they treated me like your partner treats you, I'd be concerned. For me it's an absolute dealbreaker in relationships--but in your case, at minimum, it's time for a serious conversation. He's certainly old enough to be able to grasp the gravity of the situation.

They made me stay for an hour and monitored me til the Benadryl cleared up the few hives that I had. Let him know that food allergies are serious and can be life threatening. And let him know that you don\u2019t want him to leave when you\u2019re sick, even if it looks like you can take care of yourself. Do it in a non-confrontational manner. Being calm, honest, and straightforward is better than ignoring his texts. He might think you want to be alone when you\u2019re sick.

Like those people who try to trick you into eating your allergen so they can go ha see it's not real or think you're being overdramatic and making a big deal of it?

I'm gonna put a list on the fridge with the foods I can't have so we can keep track of the food I react to so hopefully this won't be such a big deal\"\n\nAnyway you should definitely see an allergist.

Unless you are allergic to something unavoidable, he shouldn't even have it to cook with, at least in my opinion. Have you seen an allergist?

When I got home I handed off the baby and ran to the bathroom.
