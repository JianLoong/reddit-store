It's just everyone \"knows\" Benadryl so it's hard to move that target onto the modern medications, even though their side effects tend to be less severe. Benadryl crosses the blood/brain barrier, which is why it causes such severe drowsiness or makes people wired. Long term use is also associated with dementia.", "Yes, I really hope OP also has an EpiPen! I had ONE mild possible anaphylactic reaction, maybe to a peach? maybe to something else?? (could have been oral allergy syndrome, could have been mild anaphylaxis...nothing like it had ever happened to me before so I wasn't sure). I described it to my doctor and she was like \"better safe than sorry\" and prescribed two epipens. I'm very lucky that my insurance covered it, but OP should look into getting an epipen if she hasn't. And stop eating what this man cooks for her."]}
