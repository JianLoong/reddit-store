I (33M) was previously married to Claire (34F). We were together for 4 years and during that time we struggled to get pregnant. We did a lot of trying. Well randomly she got pregnant and I was suspicious about the timing. She then told me it was another guys kid because she had been sleeping around. We divorced and she had the kid. Well in 2020 she showed up at my parents (she didn\u2019t know where I moved) and told them that the kid was mine. Her guy got a test done and he wasn\u2019t the father. So it was my kid. My parents called and told me and I told them I wasn\u2019t on the birth certificate, and it wasn\u2019t my kid. I\u2019m not getting a test done either. She already had a dude sign it and I don\u2019t know the kid at all. It\u2019s not my issue and she\u2019s made her choices. \n\nMy family didn\u2019t like that. My sister especially. My theory is my sister can\u2019t get pregnant and that\u2019s why she became this super aunt. Always taking pics with Claire\u2019s kid. She is always with the kid. I was obviously pissed because how dare she become friends with the woman who did that to me. My sister told me basically to grow up. We cussed each other out and my parents got involved. Over the course of a year it was one thing after another. I\u2019d show up to my parents and Claire would be there. My sister would always invite her around. I threatened to not come around anymore and my parents basically told me that would be my decision. So after one more fight with my sister and my parents backing her. I cut off my entire family in 2021. \n\nI got remarried in 2022 and none of my family was invited. Which caused my mom to have a breakdown. I was getting calls from random numbers and it was my parents. I asked them if they were still in contact with Claire and they said yes. I told them they knew what that meant then. They\u2019ve gone as far as having extended family reach out. My wife knew the situation when she met me. She said she understood and wouldn\u2019t ever ask about them. We just had our first kid this year. My parents found out and lost it. They are apparently in \u201ctherapy\u201d over it. My wife found out about it and now wants to allow them to meet our kid. Which I was adamant about not happening. I said our kid has plenty of family support and she must have lied to me at the beginning if she wants this now. I told her yesterday to stay out of it, they are my parents and I\u2019ll handle the situation. She is giving me the cold shoulder. I feel like I was upfront about this and she signed up for it.

I (33M) was previously married to Claire (34F). We were together for 4 years and during that time we struggled to get pregnant. We did a lot of trying. Well randomly she got pregnant and I was suspicious about the timing. She then told me it was another guys kid because she had been sleeping around. We divorced and she had the kid. Well in 2020 she showed up at my parents (she didn\u2019t know where I moved) and told them that the kid was mine. Her guy got a test done and he wasn\u2019t the father. So it was my kid. My parents called and told me and I told them I wasn\u2019t on the birth certificate, and it wasn\u2019t my kid. I\u2019m not getting a test done either. She already had a dude sign it and I don\u2019t know the kid at all. It\u2019s not my issue and she\u2019s made her choices. \n\nMy family didn\u2019t like that. My sister especially. My theory is my sister can\u2019t get pregnant and that\u2019s why she became this super aunt. Always taking pics with Claire\u2019s kid. She is always with the kid. I was obviously pissed because how dare she become friends with the woman who did that to me. My sister told me basically to grow up. We cussed each other out and my parents got involved. Over the course of a year it was one thing after another. I\u2019d show up to my parents and Claire would be there. My sister would always invite her around. I threatened to not come around anymore and my parents basically told me that would be my decision. So after one more fight with my sister and my parents backing her. I cut off my entire family in 2021. \n\nI got remarried in 2022 and none of my family was invited. Which caused my mom to have a breakdown. I was getting calls from random numbers and it was my parents. I asked them if they were still in contact with Claire and they said yes. I told them they knew what that meant then. They\u2019ve gone as far as having extended family reach out. My wife knew the situation when she met me. She said she understood and wouldn\u2019t ever ask about them. We just had our first kid this year. My parents found out and lost it. They are apparently in \u201ctherapy\u201d over it. My wife found out about it and now wants to allow them to meet our kid. Which I was adamant about not happening. I said our kid has plenty of family support and she must have lied to me at the beginning if she wants this now. I told her yesterday to stay out of it, they are my parents and I\u2019ll handle the situation. She is giving me the cold shoulder. I feel like I was upfront about this and she signed up for it.
