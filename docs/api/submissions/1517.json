I can't imagine being frozen in that stage of grief for nearly 20 years, you've grieved THIS HARD longer than you were together. I use to feel like that too. I urge you to consider working with a grief counceller, there's a whole large part of life you're choosing to not have and you're barely middle age. You're an adult, you can choose that for yourself. But its very Victorian. Literally, that's how Queen Victoria mourned. No one removed her ring, or veil.\nYour sister - she crossed a definite line. She can't force you into moving to a new stage. She got drunk and was a major beech tree. Its not unforgivable but enough to warrant a stern talking to. She SUCKS.\nYou - you suck. You're choosing the memory of your late husband over forgiving your living sister. Her actions warrants a TALK, an adult, heart to heart discussion. Not boycotting a wedding. You sound pretty judgemental in your description but I guess that's because you're still hurt.", "NTA. Your husband clearly meant the world to you. Those rings are a part of you. It\u2019s not remotely the same thing but I loved my nana she was my person I have a ring she gave me for my 13th and I\u2019ve never taken it off I\u2019m 36 now. I wear it every day to remember her to feel closer to her. It\u2019s not that I haven\u2019t grieved I have. But it\u2019s a way to feel closer to her. I imagine it\u2019s something similar for you. So for her to rip that off and try to force you to follow her demands nope that\u2019s not ok it\u2019s so disrespectful.", "NTA, your sister is a capital C though. Keep on living your life.", "I am questioning the veracity of this story, as  rings do not usually slide that easily off of fingers.  Especially wedding bands sized for when the hand and fingers were younger.  I've been married a little over 20 years now and that ring is not coming off my now middle aged finger without a fair amount of wiggling (I still weigh the same now as I did when I was married).\n\nSo, I'm just finding it hard to believe the sister was able to slide a wedding band off the OP's finger without the OP realizing what she was trying to do or resisting it.  Especially if sister was was tipsy on top of it.  \n\nAlso, not that they're necessary, but, no engagement ring?  I wear both together, as I have since we got married, and it also seems odd to me that OP would continue to wear the wedding band but not the engagement ring.\n\n(And I hope it is made up, because the idea of a man who would demand that his soon-to-be-widowed-at-age-28 wife promise him she will stay lonely the rest of her life is pretty terrible.  So if this is true, I hope the OP is reading the other comments recommending a therapist.)", "NTA. Yes, you did overreact a bit, however, she clearly doesn't remotely respect you, or your wishes. She honestly pushed you to that point.", "NTA your sister was BLATANTLY disrespectful, and has been for years it seems, to your desires on the matter. If the wedding will be too painful for you to attend and a reminder of her disrespect, then don't go. You're both grown women who can make grown choices, and she clearly made hers by not respecting your wishes.", "NTA \u2014 no one can force you to attend a wedding against your will. Its important to be there for significant family milestones though, and I think it\u2019d be a good idea to attempt to mediate. At the same time, it does sound like she\u2019s violated your boundaries multiple times over the years. Ultimately up to you whether you want to attend but I\u2019d keep in mind that not attending would likely make it difficult to resolve conflict with your sister because it will conflate the ring incident with the wedding, when previously they might have been unrelated events.", "Not sure how to judge this. Gonna say NTA, but you're bordering on martyring yourself and it probably does pain people around you.\n\nIt's up to you to determine if your sister is a selfish person and if you want to go LC with her. If you don't, then it might be best to have a talk with her and try to patch things up, so you don't have to *not* attend the wedding. As things stand, you have every right to abstain.\n\nYou may have promised to stay faithful, but given how things have played out, it might be time to ask if that was really fair to yourself. And also, if any person could even imagine what they'll leave behind and how it affects those people. Would your late husband really want this, after nearly 20 years?\n\nAnd if this is what your sister thinks, at least be open to the idea that she does this out of a sense of care that got twisted up and caused these problems. If she can recognize that, then the two of you have a good chance of settling things. And maybe you OP have a chance at coping in a different way and making something else of your life.\n\nOh, and don't let anybody outside of this judge you. Screw them for calling you horrible.", "ESH. Even though I think it's probably coming from a place of concern deep down, your sister crossed a boundary. However, not going to her wedding seems like a major overreaction. Respectfully, your husband passed when you were 28. I hope you're getting therapy. You don't ever have to take your ring off, but reacting that drastically feels like there's a much more deep rooted issue there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your choice is your choice, and your sister was the AH for disrespecting it regardless of what her or anyone else\u2019s opinion of it is. You are 100% entitled to continue wearing that ring and keeping your commitment to your late husband, and that choice should be respected. \n\nBut I am concerned about your reaction to the ring being removed for less than a minute. She didn\u2019t drop the ring down the drain, swallow it, put it on her own finger etc.. \n\nI whole heartedly admit I can\u2019t imagine the pain of his loss, and the commitment you have to his memory screams volumes about how much you love and miss him. But I worry that this reaction to a minute of not wearing the ring isn\u2019t healthy. Processing your grief doesn\u2019t mean breaking your promise to him, but what have you done to process your grief? Was the ring being removed an anxiety response or a grief response? Have you spoke to a counselor or therapist about becoming a widow at such a young age? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH per say, but the reaction is concerning. It\u2019s not from a place of malice but pain - and it sounds a bit like you haven\u2019t developed the healthiest coping mechanism for that pain. \n\nLet me be clear - I\u2019m not saying get over your husband. I\u2019m not saying stop feeling pain or get back out there. Processing grief doesn\u2019t mean letting him go or moving on - it means finding peace in holding both the love and the pain in your heart. Talk to a grief therapist and see if this reaction was anxiety (that the ring has become something of a security blanket for you) or grief (betrayal from your sister in her removal of the ring and what it symbolizes), and find healthy coping mechanisms.", "NTA", "NTA. And you still wouldn\u2019t be for skipping out on the wedding.

I don\u2019t know if this story will help you, it just crossed my mind. All this to say: it is worth it, you will always have the bond you created while he was here. Taking off a ring or going on a date doesn\u2019t invalidate that bond. But if you don\u2019t want to, you don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to do.

That is it", "This is what I was thinking. \n\nMy grandma was a widow most of my mother life. She mourned and then had her life.

Yeah. But I think being so easy to rouse to uncontrollable anger or sadness after such a long period of time means OP isn't at peace. They have a right to grieve how they want, but I'd be worried that she is actually hurting herself. Long periods of time with extended levels of stress impacts how our brains rewire. I'm pretty sure there's also studies out there that link it to negative physical health outcomes too, but I'm meant to be working so I won't go down that google rabbithole. \n\nIf she's been at a heightened sense of any kind of stress for that long, it genuinely might be impacting her more than just wearing a ring and not dating.", "And that\u2019s fine, but people post to get opinions.

You got upset for completely understandable reasons. She crossed your boundaries. My advice: 1) Sit her down and talk to her. She needs to understand, and respect, that you will move on IF, and ONLY IF you are ready. It is not her decision and she needs to understand that if she can't respect your decision, even if she doesn't agree with it, she is running the risk of damaging your relationship permanently. 2) Separately sit your parents down and tell them to back off. You are not two teenage girls fighting over petty teenage girl crap. Your sister crossed a boundary and your family needs to understand your decision to take that ring off is your decision alone. No one else's. \n\nBe kind but firm during both conversations. I truly don't think your family are coming from a place of selfishness, rather not understanding.

They only loved once and they aren't obligated to get married again. If they fall in love again and get married again, nothing wrong with that. But no one needs to get married again. If OP wants to live her life that way, as long as she's not hurting herself, sister needs to back down. She's exercising, showering, attending parties, attending a wedding.

As the waters rise, the local preacher kneels in prayer on the church porch, surrounded by water. By and by, one of the townsfolk comes up the street in a canoe.\n\n\"Better get in, Preacher. The waters are rising fast.\"\n\n\"No,\" says the preacher. \"I have faith in the Lord. He will save me.\"\n\nStill the waters rise. Now the preacher is up on the balcony, wringing his hands in supplication, when another guy zips up in a motorboat.\n\n\"Come on, Preacher. We need to get you out of here. The levee's gonna break any minute.\"\n\nOnce again, the preacher is unmoved. \"I shall remain. The Lord will see me through.\"\n\nAfter a while the levee breaks, and the flood rushes over the church until only the steeple remains above water. The preacher is up there, clinging to the cross, when a helicopter descends out of the clouds, and a state trooper calls down to him through a megaphone.\n\n\"Grab the ladder, Preacher. This is your last chance.\"\n\nOnce again, the preacher insists the Lord will deliver him.\n\nAnd, predictably, he drowns.\n\nA pious man, the preacher goes to heaven. After a while he gets an interview with God, and he asks the Almighty, \"Lord, I had unwavering faith in you. Why didn't you deliver me from that flood?\"\n\nGod shakes his head. \"What did you want from me? I sent you two boats and a helicopter.\"\n\n\n\nNeither God nor your late husband want you to be alone all your life and you'll constantly be sent the metaphoric boats and helicopters.

I would agree with several of the comments suggesting you see a grief counsellor.

She's not moved to acceptance yet. The fact that she's still there, and frames her viewpoint as such, is what's wrong. \n\nLike an addict crumbling their own life around themselves, she's sequestered herself away for 20 years to prove her loyalty to a pile of rotted meat and a memory.

But this situation only exists because her sister has watched, from the perspective of a sibling, her sister grieve alone for 20 years. 20. Years. \n\nThat's not normal. Op has probably done many things in those 20 years to prompt sister to still be trying to kick her out of her rutt. \n\nOps story isn't full of 20 years of incidents of this, but drunk sister wasn't just telling her to go find a man. It was a way to try and push her out of bring stuck on her former husband for life.\n\nIf op goes to her grave never seeking therapy and forcing herself to be alone in his honor, she's spent her whole life wrapped around a mental moment of grief and no one is helping her out of it because of a fear of 'invalidating her'.\n\nTldr - her sister is, in a roundabout way, trying to get her to move on from her dead husband.

My husband lost weight and his ring doesn't fit anymore but he doesn't want to ruin the inscription I had engraved inside it so it sits in a box and he wears a very cheap replica.  I don't care if he wears a ring or not (fidelity doesn't come with jewelry) but he likes wearing one.\n\nA necklace is smart.  I do take mine off (with a considerable amount of wiggling) when I'm doing something physical with my hands and don't want to risk the rings or my fingers.  I then put them someplace safe and promptly forget where that is and panic later.  Le sigh. I should start putting them on my necklace, too.", "She didn't say anything about her husband asking her to make this promise.

Her reaction to her sister (who did absolutely pull an asshole move) seemed over the top though.

I don't love them romantically (one is close, but really they where high and I had to admit my deep affection. I'm technically grey acearo.

Due to that, and the sisters constant disrespect over your happiness of being single and disinterest in dating, I fully believe your NTA.", "ESH. Your sister was very disrespectful to you and your wishes, and I feel a lot of sympathy for you having to go through that. Taking the rings off must feel like he's leaving you again. Death is final and permanent, but life is not. YWBTA if you skip her wedding without sitting down to speak with her. Is screaming at her multiple times the way that a woman in her 40s deals with hurt in the usual manner? No. Even if you are very protective of your rings and your late husband's legacy, that was quite an extreme reaction. Sit with her, tell her how it hurt, and see if you can mend your relationship. \n\nThis sub has an attitude of \"I feel sad/hurt/bad/angry so I get to act however I want\". I encourage you all to deal with your boss, mother, stranger, etc, the way you encourage others to deal with theirs. Explosions of anger when we're upset is not healthy, OP I suggest you speak to someone about your grief and loss.

She was drunk and did something stupid but not so bad to never talk to her again over. Also you made a promise to stay faithful to your husband after he died? If your husband agreed that you should do this, then he sounded like he was a little toxic. My boyfriend would never make me promise to be single for the rest of my life at 28. That is so toxic and please seak help. Humans need affection and touch it's literally proven.", "A very gentle YTA. Not for your eternal grief and promise to your long-gone husband, but for allowing that to cause you to miss your very much alive sister\u2019s wedding.", "ESH. Yes your sister crossed a line.

You feel you need to honor this promise to you late husband, I get that. But tbh it was an unfair promise for him to ask for. \u201cRemain faithful\u201d sounds more like controlling your body than honoring the love you two shared. \n\nThere\u2019s a difference between feeling content with yourself and not needing a relationship and whatever this is you\u2019re doing - frozen grief, frozen life. You are hurting yourself. And not going to the wedding is a massive reaction. Talk to your sister. See what reflection she holds up to you. You don\u2019t have to agree with her, but it might help you to hear what she (and likely others) see when they see you.", "ESH - I don't think it was wrong for you to get quote upset. Your sister did disrespect you. She obviously had a brash sense of humor and stepped over the line. I don't think she maliciously meant to hurt you though.

If so it might be worth finding someone you can talk with to work through your feelings so if this happens again you aren\u2019t stewing in anger.\n\nYour sister was out of line and she\u2019s definitely the asshole for that night.  You get to grieve how you want or need to and so on that night you were NTA.\n\nAs for your whole question I\u2019m leaning toward a gentle ESH for you because it feels a bit like you are judging your sister by the standards you hold for yourself and refusing to attend her second wedding because it\u2019s a second wedding.  If that is why you aren\u2019t going then ESH.", " Esh?\n\nYour sister is definitely the bigger Ah, totally disrespectful. I think missing the wedding is probably over reacting.
