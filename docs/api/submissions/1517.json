I can't imagine being frozen in that stage of grief for nearly 20 years, you've grieved THIS HARD longer than you were together. I use to feel like that too. I urge you to consider working with a grief counceller, there's a whole large part of life you're choosing to not have and you're barely middle age. You're an adult, you can choose that for yourself. But its very Victorian. Literally, that's how Queen Victoria mourned. No one removed her ring, or veil.\nYour sister - she crossed a definite line. She can't force you into moving to a new stage. She got drunk and was a major beech tree. Its not unforgivable but enough to warrant a stern talking to. She SUCKS.\nYou - you suck. You're choosing the memory of your late husband over forgiving your living sister. Her actions warrants a TALK, an adult, heart to heart discussion. Not boycotting a wedding. You sound pretty judgemental in your description but I guess that's because you're still hurt.", "NTA. Your husband clearly meant the world to you. Those rings are a part of you. It\u2019s not remotely the same thing but I loved my nana she was my person I have a ring she gave me for my 13th and I\u2019ve never taken it off I\u2019m 36 now. I wear it every day to remember her to feel closer to her. It\u2019s not that I haven\u2019t grieved I have. But it\u2019s a way to feel closer to her. I imagine it\u2019s something similar for you. So for her to rip that off and try to force you to follow her demands nope that\u2019s not ok it\u2019s so disrespectful.", "NTA, your sister is a capital C though. Keep on living your life.", "I am questioning the veracity of this story, as  rings do not usually slide that easily off of fingers.  Especially wedding bands sized for when the hand and fingers were younger.  I've been married a little over 20 years now and that ring is not coming off my now middle aged finger without a fair amount of wiggling (I still weigh the same now as I did when I was married).\n\nSo, I'm just finding it hard to believe the sister was able to slide a wedding band off the OP's finger without the OP realizing what she was trying to do or resisting it.  Especially if sister was was tipsy on top of it.  \n\nAlso, not that they're necessary, but, no engagement ring?  I wear both together, as I have since we got married, and it also seems odd to me that OP would continue to wear the wedding band but not the engagement ring.\n\n(And I hope it is made up, because the idea of a man who would demand that his soon-to-be-widowed-at-age-28 wife promise him she will stay lonely the rest of her life is pretty terrible.  So if this is true, I hope the OP is reading the other comments recommending a therapist.)", "NTA. Yes, you did overreact a bit, however, she clearly doesn't remotely respect you, or your wishes. She honestly pushed you to that point.", "NTA your sister was BLATANTLY disrespectful, and has been for years it seems, to your desires on the matter. If the wedding will be too painful for you to attend and a reminder of her disrespect, then don't go. You're both grown women who can make grown choices, and she clearly made hers by not respecting your wishes.", "NTA \u2014 no one can force you to attend a wedding against your will. Its important to be there for significant family milestones though, and I think it\u2019d be a good idea to attempt to mediate. At the same time, it does sound like she\u2019s violated your boundaries multiple times over the years. Ultimately up to you whether you want to attend but I\u2019d keep in mind that not attending would likely make it difficult to resolve conflict with your sister because it will conflate the ring incident with the wedding, when previously they might have been unrelated events.", "Not sure how to judge this. Gonna say NTA, but you're bordering on martyring yourself and it probably does pain people around you.\n\nIt's up to you to determine if your sister is a selfish person and if you want to go LC with her. If you don't, then it might be best to have a talk with her and try to patch things up, so you don't have to *not* attend the wedding. As things stand, you have every right to abstain.\n\nYou may have promised to stay faithful, but given how things have played out, it might be time to ask if that was really fair to yourself. And also, if any person could even imagine what they'll leave behind and how it affects those people. Would your late husband really want this, after nearly 20 years?\n\nAnd if this is what your sister thinks, at least be open to the idea that she does this out of a sense of care that got twisted up and caused these problems. If she can recognize that, then the two of you have a good chance of settling things. And maybe you OP have a chance at coping in a different way and making something else of your life.\n\nOh, and don't let anybody outside of this judge you. Screw them for calling you horrible.", "ESH. Even though I think it's probably coming from a place of concern deep down, your sister crossed a boundary. However, not going to her wedding seems like a major overreaction. Respectfully, your husband passed when you were 28. I hope you're getting therapy. You don't ever have to take your ring off, but reacting that drastically feels like there's a much more deep rooted issue there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your choice is your choice, and your sister was the AH for disrespecting it regardless of what her or anyone else\u2019s opinion of it is. You are 100% entitled to continue wearing that ring and keeping your commitment to your late husband, and that choice should be respected. \n\nBut I am concerned about your reaction to the ring being removed for less than a minute. She didn\u2019t drop the ring down the drain, swallow it, put it on her own finger etc.. \n\nI whole heartedly admit I can\u2019t imagine the pain of his loss, and the commitment you have to his memory screams volumes about how much you love and miss him. But I worry that this reaction to a minute of not wearing the ring isn\u2019t healthy. Processing your grief doesn\u2019t mean breaking your promise to him, but what have you done to process your grief? Was the ring being removed an anxiety response or a grief response? Have you spoke to a counselor or therapist about becoming a widow at such a young age? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH per say, but the reaction is concerning. It\u2019s not from a place of malice but pain - and it sounds a bit like you haven\u2019t developed the healthiest coping mechanism for that pain. \n\nLet me be clear - I\u2019m not saying get over your husband. I\u2019m not saying stop feeling pain or get back out there. Processing grief doesn\u2019t mean letting him go or moving on - it means finding peace in holding both the love and the pain in your heart. Talk to a grief therapist and see if this reaction was anxiety (that the ring has become something of a security blanket for you) or grief (betrayal from your sister in her removal of the ring and what it symbolizes), and find healthy coping mechanisms.", "NTA", "NTA. And you still wouldn\u2019t be for skipping out on the wedding.

Grief is definitely a process that is different for everyone and I think you should do as you see fit and what is best for you. My grandpa\u2019s wife died when I was young, and he eventually got remarried. However, when he died, he was buried with his first wife. I don\u2019t know if this story will help you, it just crossed my mind. All this to say: it is worth it, you will always have the bond you created while he was here. Taking off a ring or going on a date doesn\u2019t invalidate that bond. But if you don\u2019t want to, you don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to do.

That is it", "This is what I was thinking. \n\nMy grandma was a widow most of my mother life. She mourned and then had her life. She went out with friend, holidays, travelling, enjoyed her golden years. She was happy and didn't need a SO but her side to be happy. You don't need to be in a relationship to have a full life. And she never took off her wedding band either.", "The problem I have with this which you\u2019ve already agreed to in your original comment is that she is still mourning her passed husband after 18 years. Yes there are stages of grief but this idea is that you progress through them and it is not good for anyone mental health to get hung up on any one of them.", "Her description of screaming at her sister and going home to cry doesn't sound like she's at peace with her grief. \n\nWas her sister being an idiot? Yeah. But I think being so easy to rouse to uncontrollable anger or sadness after such a long period of time means OP isn't at peace. They have a right to grieve how they want, but I'd be worried that she is actually hurting herself. Long periods of time with extended levels of stress impacts how our brains rewire. I'm pretty sure there's also studies out there that link it to negative physical health outcomes too, but I'm meant to be working so I won't go down that google rabbithole. \n\nIf she's been at a heightened sense of any kind of stress for that long, it genuinely might be impacting her more than just wearing a ring and not dating.", "And that\u2019s fine, but people post to get opinions.

It's certainly not an excuse to put their hands on her and forcibly take off her wedding ring.", "Grief never leaves people. It's a common misconception that people pass through stages and then come out okay as if it never happened. Grief becomes a part of yourself.

I see a lot of comments here talking about how OP should move on.

It doesn\u2019t mean they are necessarily stuck in a stage of grief, if they are living their lives and being productive. Usually it\u2019s older widows/widowers but everyone is different. Some people who are grieving wouldn\u2019t even be able to handle celebrating the love/marriage of another couple without falling apart.

I think your sister got drunk and crossed a line, but I don't think she did it with malicious intent or as a way to control you and I largely think it comes from a place of not understanding what it is like to have a spouse pass away and wanting to see you happy. You got upset for completely understandable reasons. She crossed your boundaries. My advice: 1) Sit her down and talk to her. She needs to understand, and respect, that you will move on IF, and ONLY IF you are ready. It is not her decision and she needs to understand that if she can't respect your decision, even if she doesn't agree with it, she is running the risk of damaging your relationship permanently. 2) Separately sit your parents down and tell them to back off. You are not two teenage girls fighting over petty teenage girl crap. Your sister crossed a boundary and your family needs to understand your decision to take that ring off is your decision alone. No one else's. \n\nBe kind but firm during both conversations. I truly don't think your family are coming from a place of selfishness, rather not understanding.

If it's a joke to remove your wedding ring, what part of that was funny?\n\n\nNobody needs a partner to make their life complete. Some widows/widowers are fine that way. They only loved once and they aren't obligated to get married again. If they fall in love again and get married again, nothing wrong with that. But no one needs to get married again. If OP wants to live her life that way, as long as she's not hurting herself, sister needs to back down. She's exercising, showering, attending parties, attending a wedding.

I still get down around birthdays and anniversaries but now I know better ways of coping and can deal with it in a healthier way. \n\nPlease speak with a counselor. You will be amazed at how much it helps.", "NTA. She had constantly undermined and disrespected the way you mourn your loss.

Why should you support her?", "NTA but This reminds me of a religious story:\n\nA storm descends on a small town, and the downpour soon turns into a flood. As the waters rise, the local preacher kneels in prayer on the church porch, surrounded by water. By and by, one of the townsfolk comes up the street in a canoe.\n\n\"Better get in, Preacher. The waters are rising fast.\"\n\n\"No,\" says the preacher. \"I have faith in the Lord. He will save me.\"\n\nStill the waters rise. Now the preacher is up on the balcony, wringing his hands in supplication, when another guy zips up in a motorboat.\n\n\"Come on, Preacher. We need to get you out of here. The levee's gonna break any minute.\"\n\nOnce again, the preacher is unmoved. \"I shall remain. The Lord will see me through.\"\n\nAfter a while the levee breaks, and the flood rushes over the church until only the steeple remains above water. The preacher is up there, clinging to the cross, when a helicopter descends out of the clouds, and a state trooper calls down to him through a megaphone.\n\n\"Grab the ladder, Preacher. This is your last chance.\"\n\nOnce again, the preacher insists the Lord will deliver him.\n\nAnd, predictably, he drowns.\n\nA pious man, the preacher goes to heaven. After a while he gets an interview with God, and he asks the Almighty, \"Lord, I had unwavering faith in you. Why didn't you deliver me from that flood?\"\n\nGod shakes his head. \"What did you want from me? I sent you two boats and a helicopter.\"\n\n\n\nNeither God nor your late husband want you to be alone all your life and you'll constantly be sent the metaphoric boats and helicopters.

He used his own death and her grief to manipulate her into placing a forever curse on her.\n\nTbh what i think your sister did is unacceptable. Why didnt you simply yank your hand back? Surely the ring isnt so loose as to just be slipped off like that? Anyway i can totally get her frustration in this situation. It must be very difficult to watch someone lock themselves up their entire life.\n\nBut a gentle YTA for saying you wont go to her wedding. Communicate properly.", "Absolutely NTA. I would agree with several of the comments suggesting you see a grief counsellor. It may help you with any pain you are still suffering, but may also confirm to friends & family that you aren't still grieving, but honouring a commitment you made to your husband that you are happy to do until you die. If they don't respect your choices then maybe they are not worthy if your respect either.\n\nI feel there is often a kind of snobbery from people in relationships where they look down on people who choose to stay single, and they feel the need to play matchmaker. They can't fathom that fulfilment in life is completely subjective. I've been married for 22 years now and my wife is not the healthiest person. If, God forbid, she should pass I can't imagine ever being able to let someone else into my heart. That's not down to the longevity of our marriage; I've loved her that much since the beginning.\n\nGood luck to you.

She has no business dictating your life like that especially when she's on marriage number two.  I don't fault number of marriages but your sister clearly lacks empathy.

If you had purposely chosen to be single because THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED that would be one thing. But it sounds to me like you've made this identity of faithfulness to a dead man your life's goal.

If the sister wants to date after her husband dies, she\u2019s free to do so, but she needs to back off. Pulling the ring off OPs finger didn\u2019t come out of nowhere, and I can completely understand if OP\u2019s tired of her sisters antics and doesn\u2019t want to go to her wedding.

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the grief doesn\u2019t show up in other ways the OP doesn\u2019t even notice. To see someone you love and care about stuck in grief is difficult. Obviously the OP can do whatever, but if I was their sibling I would be pushing grief counseling too.

She\u2019s said she had her great love. She still wears her ring but that doesn\u2019t stop her from living her life.

I feel some people need to justify their choice to move on and put down any guilt they may have.

You don\u2019t get to decide if someone else\u2019s boundaries are worth respecting.

Something comparable would be having a monogamous relationship and having a boundary that you don\u2019t want friends/family members trying to set you up on a date while you are in a relationship. That is perfectly reasonable. If you don\u2019t think so, give me your girlfriend\u2019s number, I\u2019ll start taking her on dates, because you may be dating her, but I think it would be better for you if I was dating her.", "And she\u2019s getting voted the asshole for not doing so.

OP\u2019s sister is selfish in thinking that her desire for OP to date is more important than OP\u2019s disinterest in dating. Telling someone to move on because they don\u2019t want to get back into the dating scene is vile when the person has been telling you that they aren\u2019t interested for YEARS.

Hey sister telling her to move on is a bad thing when she has been told to back off for YEARS.
