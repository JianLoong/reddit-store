I can't imagine being frozen in that stage of grief for nearly 20 years, you've grieved THIS HARD longer than you were together. I use to feel like that too. I urge you to consider working with a grief counceller, there's a whole large part of life you're choosing to not have and you're barely middle age. You're an adult, you can choose that for yourself. But its very Victorian. Literally, that's how Queen Victoria mourned. No one removed her ring, or veil.\nYour sister - she crossed a definite line. She can't force you into moving to a new stage. She got drunk and was a major beech tree. Its not unforgivable but enough to warrant a stern talking to. She SUCKS.\nYou - you suck. You're choosing the memory of your late husband over forgiving your living sister. Her actions warrants a TALK, an adult, heart to heart discussion. Not boycotting a wedding. You sound pretty judgemental in your description but I guess that's because you're still hurt.", "NTA. Your husband clearly meant the world to you. Those rings are a part of you. It\u2019s not remotely the same thing but I loved my nana she was my person I have a ring she gave me for my 13th and I\u2019ve never taken it off I\u2019m 36 now. I wear it every day to remember her to feel closer to her. It\u2019s not that I haven\u2019t grieved I have. But it\u2019s a way to feel closer to her. I imagine it\u2019s something similar for you. So for her to rip that off and try to force you to follow her demands nope that\u2019s not ok it\u2019s so disrespectful.", "NTA, your sister is a capital C though. Keep on living your life.", "I am questioning the veracity of this story, as  rings do not usually slide that easily off of fingers.  Especially wedding bands sized for when the hand and fingers were younger.  I've been married a little over 20 years now and that ring is not coming off my now middle aged finger without a fair amount of wiggling (I still weigh the same now as I did when I was married).\n\nSo, I'm just finding it hard to believe the sister was able to slide a wedding band off the OP's finger without the OP realizing what she was trying to do or resisting it.  Especially if sister was was tipsy on top of it.  \n\nAlso, not that they're necessary, but, no engagement ring?  I wear both together, as I have since we got married, and it also seems odd to me that OP would continue to wear the wedding band but not the engagement ring.\n\n(And I hope it is made up, because the idea of a man who would demand that his soon-to-be-widowed-at-age-28 wife promise him she will stay lonely the rest of her life is pretty terrible.  So if this is true, I hope the OP is reading the other comments recommending a therapist.)", "NTA. Yes, you did overreact a bit, however, she clearly doesn't remotely respect you, or your wishes. She honestly pushed you to that point.", "NTA your sister was BLATANTLY disrespectful, and has been for years it seems, to your desires on the matter. If the wedding will be too painful for you to attend and a reminder of her disrespect, then don't go. You're both grown women who can make grown choices, and she clearly made hers by not respecting your wishes.", "NTA \u2014 no one can force you to attend a wedding against your will. Its important to be there for significant family milestones though, and I think it\u2019d be a good idea to attempt to mediate. At the same time, it does sound like she\u2019s violated your boundaries multiple times over the years. Ultimately up to you whether you want to attend but I\u2019d keep in mind that not attending would likely make it difficult to resolve conflict with your sister because it will conflate the ring incident with the wedding, when previously they might have been unrelated events.", "Not sure how to judge this. Gonna say NTA, but you're bordering on martyring yourself and it probably does pain people around you.\n\nIt's up to you to determine if your sister is a selfish person and if you want to go LC with her. If you don't, then it might be best to have a talk with her and try to patch things up, so you don't have to *not* attend the wedding. As things stand, you have every right to abstain.\n\nYou may have promised to stay faithful, but given how things have played out, it might be time to ask if that was really fair to yourself. And also, if any person could even imagine what they'll leave behind and how it affects those people. Would your late husband really want this, after nearly 20 years?\n\nAnd if this is what your sister thinks, at least be open to the idea that she does this out of a sense of care that got twisted up and caused these problems. If she can recognize that, then the two of you have a good chance of settling things. And maybe you OP have a chance at coping in a different way and making something else of your life.\n\nOh, and don't let anybody outside of this judge you. Screw them for calling you horrible.", "ESH. Even though I think it's probably coming from a place of concern deep down, your sister crossed a boundary. However, not going to her wedding seems like a major overreaction. Respectfully, your husband passed when you were 28. I hope you're getting therapy. You don't ever have to take your ring off, but reacting that drastically feels like there's a much more deep rooted issue there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your choice is your choice, and your sister was the AH for disrespecting it regardless of what her or anyone else\u2019s opinion of it is. You are 100% entitled to continue wearing that ring and keeping your commitment to your late husband, and that choice should be respected. \n\nBut I am concerned about your reaction to the ring being removed for less than a minute. She didn\u2019t drop the ring down the drain, swallow it, put it on her own finger etc.. \n\nI whole heartedly admit I can\u2019t imagine the pain of his loss, and the commitment you have to his memory screams volumes about how much you love and miss him. But I worry that this reaction to a minute of not wearing the ring isn\u2019t healthy. Processing your grief doesn\u2019t mean breaking your promise to him, but what have you done to process your grief? Was the ring being removed an anxiety response or a grief response? Have you spoke to a counselor or therapist about becoming a widow at such a young age? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH per say, but the reaction is concerning. It\u2019s not from a place of malice but pain - and it sounds a bit like you haven\u2019t developed the healthiest coping mechanism for that pain. \n\nLet me be clear - I\u2019m not saying get over your husband. I\u2019m not saying stop feeling pain or get back out there. Processing grief doesn\u2019t mean letting him go or moving on - it means finding peace in holding both the love and the pain in your heart. Talk to a grief therapist and see if this reaction was anxiety (that the ring has become something of a security blanket for you) or grief (betrayal from your sister in her removal of the ring and what it symbolizes), and find healthy coping mechanisms.", "NTA", "NTA. And you still wouldn\u2019t be for skipping out on the wedding.

Good luck, OP.", "It's  your  choice  ,you are an adult and she needs  to respect  it. \n\nShe can have  her opinion  but trying  to force  it on you is a huge AH move. \n\nIt wasn't  a joke,  tell her to get a dictionary  and  check the definition  of a joke,  as making you cry, upsetting  you AND DISRESPECT/DISREGARD  YOUR DECISIONS is NOT  a joke at all.\n \nNta the ah your sister  is a huge AH.  She needs  to get back and then stay in her lane. And appologise.\n\nInform your mom and sister  that if they are OK being  your  sister's  marionettes  great for them,  you refuse  to be one and you have  the right to set and maintain  your  boundaries  which your  sister  treaded  on time and time again  . \n\nSince you can't  trust  her to respect  your  boundaries and decisions  you are making  sure she isn't  in a position ignore  them again  by staying away  from her.", "I give husband a pass for asking, because he was young and wanted to cling to life, or know he would be remembered. But he was wrong to do so.", "Dude are you missing the constant disrespect the sister is showing by not listening to the OPs clear refusals over several years? Why are you assuming there has never been a talk. \u201cI\u2019m committed to my husband I don\u2019t want to date anyone.\u201d Is the boundary. She didn\u2019t ever respect it. And what she wears on her body is no one\u2019s business. I\u2019d you aren\u2019t hurting anyone people need to butt out.", "Not everyone is unhappy living alone. It doesn\u2019t sound like OP is grieving, it sounds like OP really truly isn\u2019t interested in being in another relationship. Just because you wanted to move on doesn\u2019t mean she has to. Also would you tell someone to be okay with a spouse disrespecting them like this or would you tell them to leave them?  It\u2019s not any different for families as it is for spouses.", "Her method of mourning is hurting literally no one.  She has every right to live as she chooses.  Why does she suck because she chooses to, in her mind, honor her lost love in this way?", "Agreed. OP doesn\u2019t need to date, her sis should respect that but OP is going to cause major damage by not attending her sisters wedding because she drunkenly off her ring. It\u2019s not her sisters place to tell her she\u2019s mourned too long or whatever but OP is going to allow this to ruin her relationship with her sister", "I am 45 and if something happened to my husband I would most definitely not date again. Sure, the situation might have been different for OP 20 years ago but she is 46 now. I have plenty of single female friends in their 40s and a very large majority of them are decidedly not interested in dating. Not because of lack of opportunity it just because they don\u2019t need nor want a romantic relationship.", "While that was right for you I don\u2019t agree, she seems very happy her choice. She had her big love, and she\u2019s good. That\u2019s her choice. Honestly, she could have lost it al lot more, I would have respected it.", "YTA. None of your business how she mourns or for how long. What if someone would have came to you the day after you lost your SO and said, Welp that's done let's go get you a new man.", "Agreed. She\u2019s choosing the dead over the living, and over something petty. The sister cleared fucked up and 100% should apologize. But not going to her wedding is too much. She was drunk which didn\u2019t help. OP and the sister need to talk. And OP serious does need grief counseling. It\u2019s not unfaithful to take off a ring, or even date, after a partner is dead.", "If it were one drunken incident, it would be petty to no-show the wedding. The repeated badgering is not a petty thing though; it\u2019s years of disrespect.", "Mine comes off pretty easily if my hands are cold. Warm my fingers up just a little, and it\u2019s nice and comfy. Some weight loss, blood pressure meds, and other factors can shrink your fingers slightly and give rings lots of play.", "I wouldn\u2019t use that as proof. I\u2019ve been married 27 years and someone could take off my rings pretty easily. Maybe not as easily in the summer but still doable.", "Its not unheard of.  My ring actually comes off quite easily, to the point I might need to resize it.", "My ring gets loose or tight depending on temperature or time of day. I also had my engagement ring and wedding ring connected, you get one you get both.", "I lost a lot of weight years ago and I can't wear my ring in my finger because it slips all time! Yes, it happens!", "I also questioned the ring coming off that easily. I wear rings and its hard for other people to remove them unless I cooperate. My ring finger on my right hand I have a ring with both my son's birth stones and their names engraved on it, sometimes they like to take it to look at it or try it on. Its not going anywhere without cooperation", "Agreed. I hope it\u2019s not true because being a widow at 28 and a spouse that age (or any age) making someone vow to stay \u201cfaithful\u201d to them after their death is just messed up.", "Make something else of her life? Seriously? What if she is happy with her life as it is? It sure seems like she is fine with the choices she has made, it\u2019s her sister who has an issue. People don\u2019t have to be married to make something of their life ffs", "I don't think OP is the one in need of  therapy here. I'm a widow too and if anyone unexpectedly ripped my wedding ring off my finger while drunkenly taunting me about my life choices I would be livid. The bride should apologize for her childish behaviour if she expects to see her sister again anytime soon. NTA.", "Read the OP.  This was just the culmination of increasingly AH behavior over many years.  How many times do you poke the tiger before it swats you?", "Think the judgment you're looking for is NAH (No Assholes Here).", "she never apologized.", "Wow no, that's not major overreaction. The sister crosswd the boundaries. She already said she will always wear her wedding ring, her sister has no business forcing her to take off the ring then throw in a \"much better\" in her comment afterwards THEN gaslighted her by saying \"oh it's just a joke jeez\". \nNTA OP, your sister is the however the TA.", "She promised him. Nothing about the husband asking.", "Never says he asked", "Umm we dont know if he asked though. She literally just said that she made a promise to him. We dont know anything about the context of the promise so we shouldnt just assume that we know", "Right. If he truly loved her there is no way he would want her to spend her life alone from age 28 to death. I'll bet if he could come back and tell her that, he would.", "Umm.. it\u2019s hurting herself? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about meeting the next one as much as it is moving on from the previous one. That\u2019s not healthy for anyone to do with anything much less a relationship.", "Obviously she can do what she wants but the comment above is by a person who has actually experienced something similar. They are trying to be helpful and probably have more experience with this specific situation than you.", "She's hurting herself and the people around her. She should move on and stop wallowing in pain and grief", "I think that boat has sailed and the bubble machine has been turned off.", "It\u2019s not OP doing that damage. The sister did that damage with her outrageous behaviour.", "Her sister should have thought of that before badgering the OP and then pulling the stunt she did. These are not the actions of a loving caring sister , so who says the OP cares about that relationship anymore?  The sister crossed many boundaries, knowing the OP\u2019s feelings on the subject, and she just didn\u2019t care. Blood tied don\u2019t excuse horrible and hurtful behavior", "We\u2019re not talking about the day after. We\u2019re talking about 18 years.", "You don\u2019t get to decide for someone else what being faithful means. That\u2019s up to all of us individually. Just because she doesn\u2019t want another partner doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s mentally unhealthy!", "You have no idea whether she has had grief counseling or not.  You also have no idea where or how she has moved on.  She can live a fulfilling and happy life just as she is.  If she needs help, she sounds like she knows enough to seek it.", "Same. Summer time was a hard time getting rings off at the end of the day.\n\nWinter? Slips off pretty easily.", "it doesnt come off that easily uless you twist it which she did. I just didnt realize what she was doing until she took it off", "Yeah, unless OP was soaking her hand in butter immediately prior to the spat, I just don't see how the ring would come off before she could react.  Also- her sister takes her hand and her first assumption is that her sister is going to kiss her hand?  I mean, I only have brothers, so many I don't understand sister-sister relationships, but that would not be anywhere in the top ten things I would expect my sibling to do if they took my hand.", "Who are you to judge someone else's romantic and sexual boundaries?\n\nOP doesn't have to go hook up with other men just to make you guys more comfortable. Ridiculous.", "No, you don't have to be married. And I never said that was what had to happen.\n\nMostly, I think it's just a mentality people get into when they lose someone, that accepting it and just being happy you ever knew them is not enough. OP, or at least people like her, make promises not for the person they've lost, but for themselves, to stay as miserable as they can. But nobody in their right mind would ever want another person to do that.\n\nLosing someone should be about celebrating that person's life, honoring their accomplishments and continuing to live in the spirit you shared. I'd really be creeped the hell out if my partner said they were going to keep my wedding ring at all times and never love anyone again", "Thanks, my brain is so tired right now but unable to sleep, and I knew NTA wasn't quite right but couldn't remember NAH. I appreciate the reminder. :)", "Then don't  go. And tell your  family  .", "Oh I am sorry I misread that guess I saw he saying she won\u2019t do it again as an apology. I would definitely talk to her though", "True, need to learn to read better...", "he never asked, but i could tell my promise meant a lot to him. I know i will see him in heaven one day and it will all be worth it.", "Whether her late husband asked her to make the promise or not, he should never have allowed her to make it. He should have rejected it immediately because by accepting it he is condemning her to a life of grief and never moving on.", "OP never said he asked", "Not being interested in dating for whatever reason isn't hurting the person who made the choice. Not everyone has to date to be happy", "This is ridiculous. I am married to the love of my life. If he were to pass away, I would not be interested in \u201cmeeting the next one\u201d or \u201cmoving on from the previous one\u201d. It\u2019s very disrespectful to her choices to assume that she is, or ever will be, interested in finding another spouse. She may have overreacted a bit, probably because of the alcohol, but she has the right to live in whatever stage of grief or acceptance that she is currently in. NTA", "She is obviously not a complete shut it.  She clearly has an active social life to be spending time with friends and family.  She just chooses not to be in another relationship.  How is this any different from other people who choose to be single?\n\nWhat damage is she doing to herself?", "Would you tell someone who had been married for fifty years to move on and get another partner?  It doesn\u2019t matter at what age you lose them. Not everyone who doesn\u2019t get a new partner is hurting themselves.", "Thats her business, if she isnt hurting someone else, *she* doesnt suck. The situation might, but not HER.", "How is it hurting her? It\u2019s her choice. People can be perfectly happy without a partner.", "How exactly is she hurting herself? She's not Ms Havisham, she exercises which means she cares about her long-term health and well-being. She just choses to remain single. The husband is an excuse, she wants to be single, it's a choice she made. I've made the same choice as her but I'm not a widow.", "Maybe she is at peace with her grief.  She might have already seen a counselor for all we know.  How she chooses to live her life after that is her business.\n\nI haven't experienced the loss of my wife, but I do know that I would also choose not to remarry.  One partner is all I ever needed in this life.", "And that other person is mourning THEIR way. While OP is mourning her way. No one even if they have experienced something similar has the right to tell her what she needs to do.", "That\u2019s not what faithful means. If OP doesn\u2019t want another relationship, that\u2019s one thing. But it sounds like OP could benefit from grief counseling from many of her comments she posted.", "You have no idea either. And it sounds like she never has had grief counseling. Being faithful after someone is gone is not what faithful is.", "The hand kissing thing was very odd to me. But nowhere close to as odd as a 28 yo promising to stay a widow-virgin *for the rest of her life*. It doesn\u2019t say that dead husband asked OP to do this though, so maybe she decided to do a Queen Vic martyrdom as her own decision.", "OP thinks she has to wear a ring and never interact with a man after losing her spouse 20 years ago to stay faithful. OP needs grief counseling, and very badly.", "To start this: I\u2019m not telling you to move on. Grief is definitely a process that is different for everyone and I think you should do as you see fit and what is best for you. My grandpa\u2019s wife died when I was young, and he eventually got remarried. However, when he died, he was buried with his first wife. I don\u2019t know if this story will help you, it just crossed my mind. All this to say: it is worth it, you will always have the bond you created while he was here. Taking off a ring or going on a date doesn\u2019t invalidate that bond. But if you don\u2019t want to, you don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to do. However, he is never going to disappear", "[deleted]", "Dude he was about to die. We have no way of knowing what mental state he was in when she told him about the promise or if he was even alive when she made it. \n\nLet us not blame someone that the only two things we know about him is that he was married to OP and is now dead. That is it", "This is what I was thinking. \n\nMy grandma was a widow most of my mother life. She mourned and then had her life. She went out with friend, holidays, travelling, enjoyed her golden years. She was happy and didn't need a SO but her side to be happy. You don't need to be in a relationship to have a full life. And she never took off her wedding band either.", "The problem I have with this which you\u2019ve already agreed to in your original comment is that she is still mourning her passed husband after 18 years. Yes there are stages of grief but this idea is that you progress through them and it is not good for anyone mental health to get hung up on any one of them.", "Her description of screaming at her sister and going home to cry doesn't sound like she's at peace with her grief. \n\nWas her sister being an idiot? Yeah. But I think being so easy to rouse to uncontrollable anger or sadness after such a long period of time means OP isn't at peace. They have a right to grieve how they want, but I'd be worried that she is actually hurting herself. Long periods of time with extended levels of stress impacts how our brains rewire. I'm pretty sure there's also studies out there that link it to negative physical health outcomes too, but I'm meant to be working so I won't go down that google rabbithole. \n\nIf she's been at a heightened sense of any kind of stress for that long, it genuinely might be impacting her more than just wearing a ring and not dating.", "And that\u2019s fine, but people post to get opinions. Of course someone with a similar experience is going to say what helped them and what they think.", " \u201cI haven't experienced the loss of my wife, but I do know that I would also choose not to remarry.\u201d said almost everyone who\u2019s remarried before losing a spouse.   \n\n\nI know several people who lost their spouses from their mid 20s to their 70s who lost the loves of their lives thinking this exact same thing but are now happily remarried.", "Clearly not given how she reacted.", "That\u2019s why I said she can do what she wants. The person with experience is offering advice- isn\u2019t the point of posting to see what others think?", "Op chooses to, not thinks she has to. She is very comfortable with her choices. Why can\u2019t you and some others respect that ?", "Let\u2019s not go questioning people\u2019s religious beliefs", "Yup. Some people have it once and it\u2019s enough. They don\u2019t need to replace it. They mourn, then they hold onto the joy and love and remain satisfied. Some people find another forever and it works, but it\u2019s still completely okay to not want to do it again", "Someone who is exercising, showering, and getting out to spend time with family sounds like someone who is processing their grief just fine to me.  Beyond that, if she chooses to hang on to the memory of her husband by staying single, that is all none of our business.  It's certainly not an excuse to put their hands on her and forcibly take off her wedding ring.", "Grief never leaves people. It's a common misconception that people pass through stages and then come out okay as if it never happened. Grief becomes a part of yourself. It's not mentally unhealthy at all, on the contrary, OP accepts his death and accepts herself being a widow.\n\nNot everyone needs to be in a relationship and move on. Some are comfortable being alone. You and OP's sister should accept that.", "Why the flying fuck do you feel like your opinion (yes, ***opinion***) should have any bearing whatsoever on OP's way of grieving and/or her relationship status?\n\nHer husband is dead. That's not ever going to leave her.", "Grief never goes away. You just learn to structure your life around it. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to replace the person you\u2019re grieving. What a bizarre mindset.", "I bet you tell moms of dead kids they can just have another one, too.\n\nYour life partner isnt an interchangeable part.\n\nYou can't just freaking replace them.\n\nOPs relationship with her husband was so satisfying, she doesn't feel the need to have another.\n\nI've been with my husband 10 years, a d if something were to happen to him, I doubt I'd remarry.\n\nHe's such a one of a kind person, who gets me like no one else ever has, how could I possibly settle for less?", "But what if OP screaming and crying is actually about the fact that her sister is constantly undermining OP\u2019s decision to remain faithful to her late husband? Why is it immediately \u201cget over your late husband\u201d and not \u201cyour frustrations with your sister poured out and you\u2019re unwilling to accept anymore disrespect\u201d? Just an add-on for perspective.", "I think her crying was directed at her interaction with her sister.", "Yes, people post here to get opinions, but OP posted to get opinions on whether she was an AH for refusing to attend her sister's wedding, *not* for declining to pursue romantic relationships.", ">And that\u2019s fine, but people post to get opinions. \n\nThis is not r/amigrievingright, OP didn't ask for opinions on her decison to remain single/married to her late husband.", "That's fine and all, but she didn't ask our opinion on how she's handling what is a lifetime at this point of dealing with the loss of her husband.\n\nIt's just sticking your nose in somebody else's business when it's nunya.", "And we judge those opinions just like we judge OP. Other commenters are allowed to say that their opinion is crap.", "The other person is saying OP is wrong for not moving on with another relationship. That\u2019s not advice. That\u2019s just plain trying to boss another person around!", "If anything ever happened to my husband, I wouldn\u2019t be interested in trying again. We enjoy so many of the same random things that I doubt I\u2019d be able to find that a second time, and I don\u2019t want the kind of relationship where the dude isn\u2019t also my bestie.", "You\u2019re absolutely right. The stages of grief is working through the pain and learning to live with it, not that it gets rid of it completely!", "OP literally put the question out there to get people\u2019s opinions of her boundary (not going to sis wedding) over her continued grieving. You need to calm down with your rage.", "I agree that people are allowed to grieve the way they want so I am not disagreeing with you on that\n\nBut people post on here to hear other peoples judgements and opinions. They are allowed to share their opinion about her way of grieving just as you are allowed to disagree with them\n\nI dont think its right to shame them for sharing an opinion when they have every right to do so\n\nEdit:  lol did I just get downvoted for saying that you are allowed to share your opinion?", "Children and spouses are apples and oranges, two completely different types of relationships that cannot be compared.\n\nYou can never replace a child or a deceased spouse but people can and do move on from losing their partner and find a new relationship.", "Again personal opinion, a life partner is definitely an interchangeable part, I have been with my life partner 8 years if she died I would have a few years grieving. Can\u2019t imagine spending 40\u201350 years of my life alone because the woman I loved died at 40 as an example.", "Cool and I am allowed to think your opinion is crap too. Look at us expressing our free right to speech!!", "Excuse me? What?", "would have given you an award if i had one"]}
