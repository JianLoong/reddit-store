Cleaning doesn't work like that.  It doesn't take twice as long to clean 2 weeks of mess versus one week.\n\nHonestly not sure why hourly became a problem or what \"tracking\" even in this context.  Tracking her hours?  Pen and paper, calendar, phone, all basic solutions.", "NTA\n\n\"Have a great time. However, I will not need you for 16 hours next week. I will need you for the scheduled 8.\"", "NTA\n\nIf I cancel in my housekeeper with short notice, I pay her for the time she had already reserved to do my home,  if she cancels on me then I do not.  \n\nYour housekeeper is canceling on you.  Just say:  have a great vacation, and we will just need you to do your normal service when you return.", "NTA. This is the type of thing that would have to be agreed upon way beforehand. I'm not sure how she could \"make up hours\" either. Once your house is clean, her work is done. What is she going to do? Clean it twice when she gets back?", "NTA\n\nNo, you pay her $300 per week she works so you don't pay her when she is getting be for the week.", "NTA. Just like any other place of employment, you don't get paid if you don't work or use PTO. Plain and simple. If you let her make up the hours, she gets paid when the work is completed/end of the week, not in advance.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t how housekeeping like this works. She\u2019s not a salaried employee. If YOU had scheduled her and then cancelled last minute I would argue that you should still pay her because she was likely counting on that income and you took it from her without notice, but that is not what has happened here. \n\nI think you need to go back to tracking. At $35/hour 4-8 hours a week at MOST comes to $280 so you\u2019ve already essentially given her a substantial raise while likely getting much less work. You need to rethink this arrangement.", "NTA.\n\nShe'll get paid for the work when it gets done, end of story.  And to be clear, I'd tell her that if she's not there it's just skipping a week, she won't be paid for it and that it's not a \"make up hours\" situation.\n\nEither keep to a specific rate per-day or per-hour, and pay when she's there.", "NTA doesn\u2019t make sense what she is asking.", "NTA. Housekeeping is not a thing that hours can be made up on. She seems to not understand that as a contractor she is only paid for hours worked. I would be concerned on her cutting corners at this point. I would suggest looking at other services for this. If you contract a cleaning agency it may be cheaper and this problem will not happen again, where she goes away no notice. If you can\u2019t do this yourself then this could be dangerous. \n\nCutting corners in cleaning is how people get mould", "NTA - there is no way for her to make up hrs. Your house shouldn't get that out of control in a week that you will need her for double hrs to get it back into shape.\n\nThe only way I would pay her without using services is if you cancel on her last minute which isn't the case. She has chosen t cancel on you and that isn't your fault.\n\nI would let her know that you hope she has a great time away but you won't need her for double the time when she gets back so you will resume payment upon her return to services.", "She\u2019s taking advantage of you \n\nLet me break it down to you: \n\n8*35 is 280$ meaning her not taking track of hours is clearly a lie cause we can\u2019t miss an extra hour if we know we are going to get paid for it, on the opposite we will create the extra the extra hours\u25b6\ufe0f\u25b6\ufe0f\u25b6\ufe0f this means she is doing less hours and doesn\u2019t want her pay to be less that is why she come up with this not keeping track what if we just do 300$ per week\n\nShe will do less hours and get pay well, now she even go far missing a whole week and expect to get paid cause you know you let her get advantage of it.\n\nOp you need your girlfriend to put your housekeeper in her place\u2026 us women knows how to handle situations like this\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 tracking her hour will be the least of her problems if she doesn\u2019t do her job well\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Nta", "NTA.

Thank you for notifying me about your absence for next week.  Just clearing up a misconception you are not a salaried cleaning I employ, but a pay as you go arrangement.

I've noticed I'm getting a bit less out of her since agreeing, but it's not egregious and I'm not a ball buster, so I'm patiently monitoring that. She has a pretty frantic personal life and I've had to chase her for a week or more to get her hours and pay her.", "I did notice a change right away. I need her here twice a week, but I've gotten 3 visits over the course of two weeks more than once since the change.

Only times that's different is if I've worked additional hours (without overtime pay) and take a day in lieu.  That's a linear job though and cleaning isn't linear.", "Please do go back to hours and please do control her cause she may be going back early that expected", "Nta", "Regularly scheduled house cleaners also tend to get faster as they go. For example, one week, she won't wipe down cupboard fronts because she did it last week, but she won't do an extra job either. \nAt some point, she will have all the deep cleaning caught up, and then it's a matter of quick maintenance. \nGo back to hourly, and when she doesn't come, she doesn't get paid. \nSource: I have dealt with over a dozen cleaners over the years."]}
