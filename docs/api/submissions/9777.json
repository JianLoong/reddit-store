We live in a paid off house and we have investments that provide me with an excellent amount of backstop to my salary.  I would would rather be in debt up to my eyes and be in his arms every night.  Trust me.  \n\nThe wedding will cost about $2,200 for a week.  It is a very good resort.  \n\nI RSVP'd no.  Maybe if it was in the summer I would consider it a vacation.  But I would need to take time off school.  My in-laws are retired and they love watching the kids but they are elderly, my husband was a little older than me, and my kids are a lot to take for a week.  \n\nIf I take the kids out of school and bring them to the wedding then it will cost $5,500 since we would be sharing a room. That would put a massive dent in our budget.  \n\nI know that my parents are still working to save for retirement. So this will be expensive for them.  \n\nMy brother called me right away to ask why I wasn't coming.  I said I really wanted to come but I just couldn't justify it.  He said that I have lots of money in the bank.  That's not really any of his business.  And if, god forbid, something happens to me, my kids are going to need that money.  I'm not going to blow a chunk of it on a wedding.  \n\nHe is upset that I won't be coming. He kept pushing until I finally admitted that I just didn't think it was the best use of my money.  Then I said something I probably should not have.  I said if he really wanted me there then he could pay for the trip.   \n\nHe hung up and hasn't called back.  \n\nMy parents did call me though and they said that I didn't need to hoard all my money.  \n\nI'm torn.  Am I being an asshole by not splurging a little and going to my brother's wedding?  Am I an asshole for basically telling him he has to pay me to go?  \n\nI can see his point of view but I have a lot of other things I need to consider.  I thought maybe an outside perspective would tell me if I'm being a bitch.\n\nEdit.\n\nBefore everyone jumps on my brother.  He came to my destination wedding.

Your brother\u2019s kind of thinking is why lottery winners end up broke in a couple of years.", "NTA. The insurance money and investment profits are all the financial support you have for the rest of your life from your husband. That $5k could go a lot farther if you held it for your own retirement or the needs of the kids in the future.

Its so disrespectful to comment on that. \n\nI am sorry for your loss, the grief is unimaginable I am sure. I don't think it would be wrong to go be celebratory and carefree with your kids if you wanted to go, even if they miss school, but its only a choice you can make when you think through all your own plans and scenarios where that money might be necessary.", "NTA.

Guests declining to attend for financial reasons is to be expected when one chooses to have a destination wedding. If we\u2019re being honest, any responsible adult would look at a $5,500 frivolous expense and say it could be spent better elsewhere. That\u2019s getting your car fixed if the engine goes out of time and you have a bent valve. That\u2019s the start of a college fund for your kids.

Destination weddings are supposed to be small. The entire point is to exclude all but a select few guests, and to spend what money is available on the honeymoon instead of on a reception. That is what the bridal couple want so that is what they should have. There are down sides to that as they are finding out.\n\nAs a single parent and sole income earner, you have a duty to be financially conservative. Accusing you of \"hoarding\" money is manipulative name calling. Your duty to your kids comes before any obligation to squander resources on another person's one-day party. This is not an emergency. If your brother needed life saving surgery I doubt you would hesitate but a wedding isn't quite that.\n\nPulling your kids out of school for a wedding would be an AH move, especially late in the term, and the same goes for spending money that ought to be your household emergency fund or your children's college money.

It wouldn't matter if the wedding was being held down the block from your home.", "NTA.\n\nJust because you have enough money right now doesn't mean you're not going to need that money for a legitimate emergency later on. You need to protect your children and yourself. Your husband died and your brother is thinking more of the insurance money than he is of your well being.\n\nA friend of mine wants a destination wedding specifically so people can't attend. That's the danger.", "NTA I agree with others, an invitation doesn't obligate you to accept the invitation. And you're right, you don't have to feel obligated to spend a large amount of money on a luxury item.", "Nta. Although you probably went about it the wrong way. I totally understand why you dont want to spend that kind of money.  You probably would have come across nicer if you just let your brother know that pulling the kids out of school wasn't an option and leaving them w your in laws wasn't a good option either. Takes the pressure off the money aspect and isn't a lie.", "NTA... but... I think a phone call instead of just an RSVP would have been a better approach. As in \"Hey, I need to do some planning to see if I can get enough time off work to travel and see if I can afford to hire someone to take care of the kids while I'm gone. And I may look into flying in the day before and leave the day after the wedding.\" Then when you call back to say you just couldn't get it to work, it's not such a shock. You should call back and let him know the decision to not attend isn't just based on money. I can imagine the personal conflict you are having thinking about attending the event alone as a widow. As much as we'd tell my widow sister that \"it's with family\" and go out of our way to try and make her not feel like a third or fifth wheel, she still had a hard time at events mostly attended by couples.", "NAH.

Your brother should understand and respect your decision.\n\nAs for your comment to your brother about him paying for the trip, it might have been better expressed in a different way, but it's understandable that you were feeling frustrated in the moment.

So if you enjoy your family and your kids would benefit from celebrating a special moment in life with them (following the death of their father) then it may be money well spent. Only you can know that. But, either way, it\u2019s no one else\u2019s responsibility to pay for you and I think you know that. So don\u2019t cause a wedge between your family out of pettiness.

Especially if you are a single parent. \n\nHe has the right to be frustrated because I am sure he cares about you and wants you there, hopefully he understands with time that is a lot of money for anyone.", "NTA\n\nexpensive destination weddings are always optional events", "It\u2019s the risk of any wedding that costs attendees a lot. Destination weddings are a particular risk. My wife and I decided that, if we were to do a destination wedding, then we would pay for our guests. Some locations were less expensive that way than getting a local reception. \n\nWe wound up eloping anyway. \n\nDefinitely NAH. \n\nYour brother is probably disappointed, but nobody gets to tell you how to spend or not spend your money.", "If that was the actual language your parents used my God are they ah.", "NTA. He needs to understand that you have 2 little kids to worry about, whether it's finding someone to take care of them while you're gone, the challenge of traveling with them and the added expense, their future education, or having a safety net in case something happens to you. It's the reality of a single parent. It's really no one's business how much money you have set aside for your family. And you're not wrong to say he could pay if he really wants you there, since your husband paid for him to attend yours.", "You have to decide works best for you.  Costs plus missing school may not what is best for you.", "NTA", "NTA - if you chose a destination wedding, some people won\u2019t go.  An invite is not a a summons.\n\nBut maybe apologize and say it\u2019s a huge hassle for you bc kids.  You\u2019d love to come if you were single again or they have a ceremony (second?) here", "It\u2019s your brother. If you don\u2019t care enough to go to his wedding even though you can afford to, well that says a lot about how much you value him and want to share in his day.  So do whatever you want to.  All these NTA people clearly don\u2019t have many people they love and care for in their lives to extend themselves enough to go to their siblings wedding.", "NTA - you didn\u2019t ask him to pay for it, you made a snarky clap back when you got frustrated, after already clearly indicating you weren\u2019t going. Not letting someone else dictate how you spend your money isn\u2019t \u201choarding.\u201d Yeesh. And after you *did* pay for him to come to yours too. And my condolences to you and your kids, the love is palpable in your words", "That's why I had mine in the USVI. The thought of a wedding gave me too much anxiety, so we just went on vacation and got married on a beautiful beach.  10/10 - would highly recommend.", "Ya it read like she doesn't GAF about her brother.", "Especially having already lost her husband so early, it makes sense that she wants to do what she can to make sure her kids are cared for if something happens to her too.", "I am picturing the dragon over Gringots", "Yup that's what I'm doing as well. My parents would pay for it but I just don't want them spending that much on a wedding. At the same time, I'd never question why anyone declines the invite because it's none of my business how they spend their money/time. \n\nBut OP, it's also okay to spend money on a vacation if it's within your means and you want to but completely understandable if that's not what you want to do.", "It's an excruciating one, OP. NTA.\n\nAlso, I messaged you if you want to look at that. I promise it's something kind. I know a lot of the time when you get messages from posts on this sub it's people being jerks without anyone else seeing it.", "How far away is the wedding distance wise? Can you compromise on 2-3 days so you just attend the actual wedding? What is the whole week thing about, their actual wedding will be a few hours on one day? You can skip extras.", "Not at all. She said money wasn't an issue and I chose to believe her.  She has a right to turn down the invitation (though a person with good manners and a good relationship with her brother would have imparted their regrets more directly and not made him find out from the rsvp card). Good manners often precludes pointless drama IMHO.", "I think weddings are way out of hand these days. It's not appropriate to blow a life savings on a big party. Weddings are really just opportunities to employ caterers, photographers, planners, florists, venue owners etc. It's not about the couple, it's just about keeping businesses in business. \n\nI got married in a park in Vancouver with my husband's landlords for witnesses and no guests. Been married 15 years now. Don't regret it.", "Yes, and her husband paid for everyone important to attend. \n\nHave you lost a spouse or even a very close family member and gotten a large inheritance? If not, you have no idea what that's like and shouldn't be all \"oh well *I* would do this\". You don't know what you would do.", "We grew flowers and raided everyone's gardens. Then we arranged them in dozens of borrowed vases the day before. It was fun."]}
