Trust me.  \n\nThe wedding will cost about $2,200 for a week.  It is a very good resort.  \n\nI RSVP'd no.  Maybe if it was in the summer I would consider it a vacation.  But I would need to take time off school.  My in-laws are retired and they love watching the kids but they are elderly, my husband was a little older than me, and my kids are a lot to take for a week.  \n\nIf I take the kids out of school and bring them to the wedding then it will cost $5,500 since we would be sharing a room. That would put a massive dent in our budget.  \n\nI know that my parents are still working to save for retirement. So this will be expensive for them.  \n\nMy brother called me right away to ask why I wasn't coming.  I said I really wanted to come but I just couldn't justify it.  He said that I have lots of money in the bank.  That's not really any of his business.  And if, god forbid, something happens to me, my kids are going to need that money.  I'm not going to blow a chunk of it on a wedding.  \n\nHe is upset that I won't be coming. He kept pushing until I finally admitted that I just didn't think it was the best use of my money.  Then I said something I probably should not have.  I said if he really wanted me there then he could pay for the trip.   \n\nHe hung up and hasn't called back.  \n\nMy parents did call me though and they said that I didn't need to hoard all my money.  \n\nI'm torn.  Am I being an asshole by not splurging a little and going to my brother's wedding?  Am I an asshole for basically telling him he has to pay me to go?  \n\nI can see his point of view but I have a lot of other things I need to consider.  I thought maybe an outside perspective would tell me if I'm being a bitch.\n\nEdit.\n\nBefore everyone jumps on my brother.  He came to my destination wedding.

That is your children's EMERGENCY fund. that's not 'Splurge on a vacation wedding' money. your obligation is to your children first and foremost, and you seem quite aware of that.

Part of having a destination wedding is accepting the fact that not everyone you want to invite can afford to attend. \nYou're being responsible with your money and realistic about costs. How much money you do or don't have in the bank is, frankly, none of his business.", "NTA. Send a nice gift, fawn over the pictures, let him get over it. Maybe I'm wrong but I thought destination weddings were so people wouldn't show up? \ud83d\ude04 It's your money, you don't need to justify your financial situation to anyone.", "NTA, your financial priority is your family and kids, a destination wedding is not.

Your brother\u2019s kind of thinking is why lottery winners end up broke in a couple of years.", "NTA. The insurance money and investment profits are all the financial support you have for the rest of your life from your husband. That $5k could go a lot farther if you held it for your own retirement or the needs of the kids in the future.

Its so disrespectful to comment on that. \n\nI am sorry for your loss, the grief is unimaginable I am sure. I don't think it would be wrong to go be celebratory and carefree with your kids if you wanted to go, even if they miss school, but its only a choice you can make when you think through all your own plans and scenarios where that money might be necessary.", "NTA.

Guests declining to attend for financial reasons is to be expected when one chooses to have a destination wedding. If we\u2019re being honest, any responsible adult would look at a $5,500 frivolous expense and say it could be spent better elsewhere. That\u2019s getting your car fixed if the engine goes out of time and you have a bent valve. That\u2019s the start of a college fund for your kids.

Destination weddings are supposed to be small. The entire point is to exclude all but a select few guests, and to spend what money is available on the honeymoon instead of on a reception. That is what the bridal couple want so that is what they should have. There are down sides to that as they are finding out.\n\nAs a single parent and sole income earner, you have a duty to be financially conservative. Accusing you of \"hoarding\" money is manipulative name calling. Your duty to your kids comes before any obligation to squander resources on another person's one-day party. This is not an emergency. If your brother needed life saving surgery I doubt you would hesitate but a wedding isn't quite that.\n\nPulling your kids out of school for a wedding would be an AH move, especially late in the term, and the same goes for spending money that ought to be your household emergency fund or your children's college money.

You have every right to decline an invitation.  It wouldn't matter if the wedding was being held down the block from your home.", "NTA.\n\nJust because you have enough money right now doesn't mean you're not going to need that money for a legitimate emergency later on. You need to protect your children and yourself. Your husband died and your brother is thinking more of the insurance money than he is of your well being.\n\nA friend of mine wants a destination wedding specifically so people can't attend. That's the danger.", "NTA I agree with others, an invitation doesn't obligate you to accept the invitation. And you're right, you don't have to feel obligated to spend a large amount of money on a luxury item.", "Nta. Although you probably went about it the wrong way. I totally understand why you dont want to spend that kind of money.  You probably would have come across nicer if you just let your brother know that pulling the kids out of school wasn't an option and leaving them w your in laws wasn't a good option either. Takes the pressure off the money aspect and isn't a lie.", "NTA... but... I think a phone call instead of just an RSVP would have been a better approach. As in \"Hey, I need to do some planning to see if I can get enough time off work to travel and see if I can afford to hire someone to take care of the kids while I'm gone. And I may look into flying in the day before and leave the day after the wedding.\" Then when you call back to say you just couldn't get it to work, it's not such a shock. You should call back and let him know the decision to not attend isn't just based on money. I can imagine the personal conflict you are having thinking about attending the event alone as a widow. As much as we'd tell my widow sister that \"it's with family\" and go out of our way to try and make her not feel like a third or fifth wheel, she still had a hard time at events mostly attended by couples.", "NAH.

Your brother should understand and respect your decision.\n\nAs for your comment to your brother about him paying for the trip, it might have been better expressed in a different way, but it's understandable that you were feeling frustrated in the moment.

Then enjoy the wedding too! \n\nIf the $5,500 will not hurt your budget for actual needs or an emergency fund, spend it on a once on a lifetime opportunity for more memories and bonding with friends and family.\n\nEven if you decide you cannot go, NAH.

So if you enjoy your family and your kids would benefit from celebrating a special moment in life with them (following the death of their father) then it may be money well spent. Only you can know that. But, either way, it\u2019s no one else\u2019s responsibility to pay for you and I think you know that. So don\u2019t cause a wedge between your family out of pettiness.

Plus to address your example,  a couch is much more practical then dropping between $2000 to $5000 for a vacation that her kids may or may not enjoy.  Maybe OP could look into flying in for the wedding and skipping the entire week.", "You paid for his attendance though at your destination wedding, right? So I don\u2019t think this is a rude ask in this particular scenario. \n\nIt\u2019s too bad that you told your family about the life insurance settlement because it would be better that they don\u2019t know your finances in detail. Personally, I would tell them that it\u2019s all gone into educational accounts for your kids. Once it\u2019s \u201callocated\u201d, it\u2019s not yours to spend on frivolous things", "Tell him that you thought that as you were saying it", "Omgosh, that's extreme. Wow. Yeah, I'm leaning more towards your practicality. I'll admit that telling your brother to pay for your presence made me cringe a little. To be fair, no one has a right to tell another how to spend their money. You are the sole parent of two minor children and have more reasons to be a good steward of your finances. I'm sorry for your loss, and I'm sorry your brother only sees the life insurance payout and not the whole picture.", "Because I would be paying over $1,000 to fly stay one night, if the resort allows that, and then fly home.", "Him pushing makes him an AH. A statement said in the heat of the moment is still OP\u2019s responsibility and makes them a soft AH.", "Figured. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a soft YTA. We are still responsible for the things we say and do in the heat of the moment,", "At least he now knows how you really feel about him.", "I agree with you wholeheartedly.  I think everyone should understand that has a destination wedding that anyone and everyone's attendance is optional because of the expensive nature of the venue.  However, I was answering her literal question on whether she was an a-hole for telling her brother she would only attend if he paid.  I think she was one for that reason.", "Is the resort the only place to get a room for a night or 2? I understand that it's pricey, but it's your brother's wedding. Idk how close you are to your brother, but personally, if I were in a similar situation, I suppose I would write down the pros and cons of attending vs. not and go from there. What would be the future impact of the relationship I currently have with my brother if I go or didn't go, the financial impact it would or would not have, etc.", "I disagree, she just informed him of what it would take to get her to attend. He is free to decline.", "It sounds like the flight itself is 1,000, and she said elsewhere it is a 12 hour flight.", "You\u2019re free to disagree. My judgement stands.", "From someone who skipped two destination weddings this year, NTA. \n\nIf I'm spending enough to take my kid somewhere, we will be enjoying a holiday, not draining our savings to deal with wedding drama.", "NTA\n\n  I never understood destination weddings. I mean, why should i pay a buttload of money to go to your wedding?? If you want people at your destination wedding, then you have to pay for airplane and hotel.", ">My parents did call me though and they said that I didn't need to hoard all my money.\n\nYou are a widow with two small children. Hoard it like a dragon. NTA. $2200 for a week long wedding is ridiculous when you also need to figure out childcare.\n\n12 hour flight! Hahaha no. Destination weddings were supposed to be for eloping but now have turned into a game of prove you love me enough to blow thousands and all your vacation time to watch me have a twenty minute ceremony and a reception you might care about and will forget about within a month. I wish people would start saying no to this stuff.", "YTA. You're not obligated to attend the wedding if you don't want to, whether it's  in the local church or a destination affair. But you clearly said that the issue is not money, then said you'd go if he paid? You're not being very honest. If you don't want to go don't go, but don't pretend it's because you can't afford it if you can.", "NTA", "NTA to be honest people who does destination wedding and expect their guests to pay for themselves are selfish. Your brother is double AH here who can't pay for his sister and children.", "NTA and you may want to cease discussions about any reserves that you and your husband have for your family.", "NTA, I thought the whole point of a destination wedding was to make sure you don\u2019t get too many guests lol", "NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are fine.", "NTA", "NTA.   Your family does not get to dictate how you spend your money.  \n\nWhen you have a destination wedding, you assume the risk that people will decide not to go because it's too expensive.  It isn't your call to decide whether it's *really* too expensive.", "NTA. Tell your family you would happily stop \"hoarding money\" if it meant having your husband back.", "NTA  A friend had a similar scenario, she lost her husband when their only child was 3. She had a large life insurance policy on her husband. After things were settled in the immediate aftermath of her loss, she put the bulk in a money market account and went back to work. Being fiscally responsible for almost 20 years enabled her to use that money to pay for her son's college education.", "Nta you know what is great to do at whatever destination he picked?  The *honey moon*.", "NTA.  This is a reality of destination weddings and your brother is choosing a location over people being able to make it.  He also does not get to dictate how you spend your money.", "NTA. The \"pay for me if you want me there\" may not have been a graceful way to approach this, but I think it was because he cornered you instead if just accepting your \"no\", so no big deal. You're definitely allowed to use your money how you see fit and honestly? Your decision does sound quite reasonable, so you're not \"hoarding money\", you're making sure you and your children have some mobey in case of emergencies.", "NTA", "NTA. It makes me feel icky how your family counts your money.", "NTA - you are a single mother - you are. It hoarding cash you are being responsible.  It\u2019s also unreasonable to ask you to leave kids for a week- or to take them out of school for a week.", "NTA - you are managing your budget, this is not in it.", "INFO: whats your approximate yearly salary and investment income, how much is in the bank.\n\nbecause honestly that does make a huge difference in context in this story.", " NTA\n\nYou are absolutely within your rights to opt out of going to your brother's wedding. Just because you have money sat in the bank doesn't mean you have to spend it on his wedding. People who plan expensive destination weddings make me laugh when they get all offended and shocked when people refuse to go, like everyone owes it to them to shell out thousands on top of the cost of gifts and outfits, to attend. \n\nYou do right to think of yours and your children's future and security, just because you have a little money in the bank and don't live paycheck to paycheck doesn't mean you are hording money. It means you aren't being short sighted, you are planning for the future and giving yourself something to fall back on if anything goes wrong in the future, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.", "NTA. He\u2019s having a destination wedding. He must know people can\u2019t go. I really don\u2019t understand why people have destination weddings and are shocked people can\u2019t make it.", "NTA. No one is required to take an invitation. Your brother needs to understand that while you love him, this just isn\u2019t feasible for you. \n\nPerhaps mention that you\u2019ll do something with him and his new spouse after the wedding to celebrate his nuptials. Be involved in a way that works for you. \n\nFamily or not, I tend to decline all destinations weddings because unless I really want too\u2026 I\u2019m not gonna pay extra to go to your party.", "This is the downside of a destination wedding. And just because you have money now doesn't mean you should just spend it.  That money is your financial security.

Did your parents or your brother offer to carry that responsibility? If not, they get even less of a say.", "NTA. Your husband paid for him to attend your wedding. A week out of someone's life is a HUGE ask.", "No one is the asshole here. It's reasonable for a brother to be upset his sister is missing his wedding because of money she does have. Then again it's HER money. She can spend it OR save it for any reason she likes. I hope you guys can communicate and come to a middle ground. Maybe they could set up a live feed and you can watch from back home. A good family relationship is more important than weddings and money, imo.", "NTA.   \nIf you have a destination wedding, you have to be OK with some people not being able to attend... and it isn't just the money. There are tons of other reasons why people can't always travel on YOUR schedule... and \"I don't want to\" is one of them.", "NTA. Some people have whole weddings with 5k. Your home no longer has 2 providers, so you have to be more careful about your money.\n\nA potential compromise would be to go for just part of the time there, and maybe hire a babysitter to supplement the kids' grandparents' workload when watching them?

Your brother\u2019s kind of thinking is why lottery winners end up broke in a couple of years.", "Me too. I thought people had destination wedding so they would not have many guests. It\u2019s absurd to think people want to use their vacation time and money to go to a destination wedding.", "I'm with you. A former HS friend deliberately had a destination wedding cause both families wanted a big wedding and they didn't.  This super reduced the attendance list.", "Exactly. My destination wedding is this year and we understood that going in, we would never try to pressure anyone into an expensive trip.", "Also if I'm spending $5k it will be for the vacation of my dreams!", "I mean if OP takes them out of school it would be because she's taking them with her, hence additional travel/stay costs", ">To be honest, if my sibling, who could easily afford to, chose not to attend my wedding because they thought it \u201cwasn\u2019t the best use of their money\u201d - I would be hurt.\n\nI'm sorry but anyone who holds a destination wedding during the school term a 12 hour flight away from their widowed single-parent-of-two sibling shouldn't be getting hurt about their not attending. It's not just the cost, but the practicalities around school, childcare, taking time off work and so on.", "Having money in the bank does not necessarily mean that she can easily afford it. That money is for her children and their future expenses.

What your brother is hearing is that even though you have the money, you don't feel his wedding is important enough for you to spend it on. Yes, the money could be used for other, valuable things. But what is the point of having it if you don't use it on experiences that will being joy and strengthen relationships. As I have learned from sad experience, money and things can be replaced. Your loved ones can't be. Please think about going to his wedding.\u201d\n\nTBH, I think telling a *widow* (who is raising two young children alone) to spend the money from her *dead* husband\u2019s life insurance on an expensive destination wedding because you \u201clearned from sad experience\u2026your loved ones can\u2019t be replaced\u201d is pretty tone deaf in these circumstances\u2026", "I mean NTA regarding your decision but more than a little YTA to yourself. It sounds like you have the money and are denying yourself a vacation to a nice resort with your family for what will presumably be a good time because you want to hold on to money even you say you have no immediate need for. This feels more like self punishment and fear than it does a rational decision and I honestly need to question why you\u2019re so attached to this money and what it represents to you because your \u2018kids might need it\u2019 excuse feels threadbare. So once again:\n\n  \nNTA exactly because it\u2019s your choice but YTA to yourself for making a choice you dont have to and denying yourself a really good time at a really nice resort you can actually afford.", "That\u2019s nice for you. $5500 is an awful lot to spend on a couch. A single mom is allowed to have different priorities.", "You decided that couch fit into your budget. She gets to decide what \"doesn't actually cost that much money\" according to her budget.

What you said is the exactly correct thing to say.\n\nIf you want me to attend this badly, then pay, otherwise, I will not be coming.", "Yeah I don\u2019t disagree, and I said that the brother should expect people not to be able to attend. But she *told him* that she\u2019s not coming because it\u2019s not the best use of her money. I think that was a hurtful thing to say.", "Correct.  It wasn't her.", "I was alluding to the lesson she knows very well and is choosing to ignore. OP is on here asking for opinions and I'm giving one. Time with our loved ones is limited. If she has the opportunity to participate in her brother's major life event I think she should. Her reasoning is valid, but she will be missing out on a special event with her family and communicating to her brother that he's not important to her. She also may be damaging the relationship for years to come over money that she could spend if she chose to. The downsides outway the benefit of not spending the money in my opinion.", "I was referring to the $2200 figure. Still comparing a one time destination wedding expense to someone blowing lottery winnings is a dumb comparison. And I literally started off my comment saying she can prioritize how she wants to spend her money.", "True. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t the brother either, but your response suggests you don\u2019t think who actually **did** pay is relevant and/or are more interested in splitting hairs - which sort of make your \u201cpoint\u201d come across as unreasonable."]}
