I'm sure it will be very nice.   \n\nI am a widowed, single mom with two young kids.  I'm not destitute or even hard up.  My husband had insurance.  We live in a paid off house and we have investments that provide me with an excellent amount of backstop to my salary.  I would would rather be in debt up to my eyes and be in his arms every night.  Trust me.  \n\nThe wedding will cost about $2,200 for a week.  It is a very good resort.  \n\nI RSVP'd no.  Maybe if it was in the summer I would consider it a vacation.  But I would need to take time off school.  My in-laws are retired and they love watching the kids but they are elderly, my husband was a little older than me, and my kids are a lot to take for a week.  \n\nIf I take the kids out of school and bring them to the wedding then it will cost $5,500 since we would be sharing a room. That would put a massive dent in our budget.  \n\nI know that my parents are still working to save for retirement. So this will be expensive for them.  \n\nMy brother called me right away to ask why I wasn't coming.  I said I really wanted to come but I just couldn't justify it.  He said that I have lots of money in the bank.  That's not really any of his business.  And if, god forbid, something happens to me, my kids are going to need that money.  I'm not going to blow a chunk of it on a wedding.  \n\nHe is upset that I won't be coming. He kept pushing until I finally admitted that I just didn't think it was the best use of my money.  Then I said something I probably should not have.  I said if he really wanted me there then he could pay for the trip.   \n\nHe hung up and hasn't called back.  \n\nMy parents did call me though and they said that I didn't need to hoard all my money.  \n\nI'm torn.  Am I being an asshole by not splurging a little and going to my brother's wedding?  Am I an asshole for basically telling him he has to pay me to go?  \n\nI can see his point of view but I have a lot of other things I need to consider.  I thought maybe an outside perspective would tell me if I'm being a bitch.\n\nEdit.\n\nBefore everyone jumps on my brother.  He came to my destination wedding.

Your brother\u2019s kind of thinking is why lottery winners end up broke in a couple of years.", "NTA. The insurance money and investment profits are all the financial support you have for the rest of your life from your husband. That $5k could go a lot farther if you held it for your own retirement or the needs of the kids in the future.

Its so disrespectful to comment on that. \n\nI am sorry for your loss, the grief is unimaginable I am sure. I don't think it would be wrong to go be celebratory and carefree with your kids if you wanted to go, even if they miss school, but its only a choice you can make when you think through all your own plans and scenarios where that money might be necessary.", "NTA.

Guests declining to attend for financial reasons is to be expected when one chooses to have a destination wedding. If we\u2019re being honest, any responsible adult would look at a $5,500 frivolous expense and say it could be spent better elsewhere. That\u2019s getting your car fixed if the engine goes out of time and you have a bent valve. That\u2019s the start of a college fund for your kids.

Destination weddings are supposed to be small. The entire point is to exclude all but a select few guests, and to spend what money is available on the honeymoon instead of on a reception. That is what the bridal couple want so that is what they should have. There are down sides to that as they are finding out.\n\nAs a single parent and sole income earner, you have a duty to be financially conservative. Accusing you of \"hoarding\" money is manipulative name calling. Your duty to your kids comes before any obligation to squander resources on another person's one-day party. This is not an emergency. If your brother needed life saving surgery I doubt you would hesitate but a wedding isn't quite that.\n\nPulling your kids out of school for a wedding would be an AH move, especially late in the term, and the same goes for spending money that ought to be your household emergency fund or your children's college money.

It wouldn't matter if the wedding was being held down the block from your home.", "NTA.\n\nJust because you have enough money right now doesn't mean you're not going to need that money for a legitimate emergency later on.

Your husband died and your brother is thinking more of the insurance money than he is of your well being.\n\nA friend of mine wants a destination wedding specifically so people can't attend. That's the danger.", "NTA I agree with others, an invitation doesn't obligate you to accept the invitation. And you're right, you don't have to feel obligated to spend a large amount of money on a luxury item.", "Nta. Although you probably went about it the wrong way. I totally understand why you dont want to spend that kind of money.  You probably would have come across nicer if you just let your brother know that pulling the kids out of school wasn't an option and leaving them w your in laws wasn't a good option either. Takes the pressure off the money aspect and isn't a lie.", "NTA... but... I think a phone call instead of just an RSVP would have been a better approach. As in \"Hey, I need to do some planning to see if I can get enough time off work to travel and see if I can afford to hire someone to take care of the kids while I'm gone. And I may look into flying in the day before and leave the day after the wedding.\" Then when you call back to say you just couldn't get it to work, it's not such a shock. You should call back and let him know the decision to not attend isn't just based on money. I can imagine the personal conflict you are having thinking about attending the event alone as a widow. As much as we'd tell my widow sister that \"it's with family\" and go out of our way to try and make her not feel like a third or fifth wheel, she still had a hard time at events mostly attended by couples.", "NAH.

Your brother should understand and respect your decision.\n\nAs for your comment to your brother about him paying for the trip, it might have been better expressed in a different way, but it's understandable that you were feeling frustrated in the moment.

So if you enjoy your family and your kids would benefit from celebrating a special moment in life with them (following the death of their father) then it may be money well spent. Only you can know that. But, either way, it\u2019s no one else\u2019s responsibility to pay for you and I think you know that. So don\u2019t cause a wedge between your family out of pettiness.

Plus to address your example,  a couch is much more practical then dropping between $2000 to $5000 for a vacation that her kids may or may not enjoy.  Maybe OP could look into flying in for the wedding and skipping the entire week.", "You paid for his attendance though at your destination wedding, right? So I don\u2019t think this is a rude ask in this particular scenario. \n\nIt\u2019s too bad that you told your family about the life insurance settlement because it would be better that they don\u2019t know your finances in detail. Personally, I would tell them that it\u2019s all gone into educational accounts for your kids. Once it\u2019s \u201callocated\u201d, it\u2019s not yours to spend on frivolous things", "Tell him that you thought that as you were saying it", "Omgosh, that's extreme. Wow. Yeah, I'm leaning more towards your practicality. I'll admit that telling your brother to pay for your presence made me cringe a little. To be fair, no one has a right to tell another how to spend their money. You are the sole parent of two minor children and have more reasons to be a good steward of your finances. I'm sorry for your loss, and I'm sorry your brother only sees the life insurance payout and not the whole picture.", "Because I would be paying over $1,000 to fly stay one night, if the resort allows that, and then fly home.", "Him pushing makes him an AH. A statement said in the heat of the moment is still OP\u2019s responsibility and makes them a soft AH.", "Figured. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a soft YTA. We are still responsible for the things we say and do in the heat of the moment,", "At least he now knows how you really feel about him.", "I agree with you wholeheartedly.  I think everyone should understand that has a destination wedding that anyone and everyone's attendance is optional because of the expensive nature of the venue.  However, I was answering her literal question on whether she was an a-hole for telling her brother she would only attend if he paid.  I think she was one for that reason.", "Is the resort the only place to get a room for a night or 2? I understand that it's pricey, but it's your brother's wedding. Idk how close you are to your brother, but personally, if I were in a similar situation, I suppose I would write down the pros and cons of attending vs. not and go from there. What would be the future impact of the relationship I currently have with my brother if I go or didn't go, the financial impact it would or would not have, etc.", "I disagree, she just informed him of what it would take to get her to attend. He is free to decline.", "It sounds like the flight itself is 1,000, and she said elsewhere it is a 12 hour flight.", "You\u2019re free to disagree. My judgement stands."]}
