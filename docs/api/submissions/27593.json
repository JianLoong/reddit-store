The boys are typical teenage boys but they are kindhearted and sweet. We have a very good relationship and they\u2019re actually home more often than not. While we aren\u2019t strict parents, we also taught them to be kind, generous and respectful and it actually worked (though we do have some bad days but no one\u2019s perfect). \n\nI have a friend that\u2019s a great mom but her and her daughter cannot stand each other right now. She complains about not being able to connect with her but I don\u2019t say anything because every child is different and I also don\u2019t have any daughters. My parenting style won\u2019t work on every child either. \n\nAnyways, this friend came over for lunch and both my boys were home. One of them had their girlfriend over and we were chatting for a bit before they both went upstairs to my son\u2019s room. My friend looked shocked and was like \u201cyou\u2019re seriously going to let them be alone in his room?\u201d I just said yeah and she was like \u201cI could never do that.\u201d I just laughed along with her.\n\nThen my eldest comes downstairs and is all like \u201chey mom I\u2019m ordering food you want anything?\u201d I said no thanks and turned back to my friend and she looked shocked again and was like \u201cbut you cooked food?\u201d I told her he\u2019s old enough to eat whatever he wants and he\u2019s ordering food with his own money that he earned so why would I stop him. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a special occasion or I specifically cooked food for him (besides what I cooked was literally just fancy looking grilled cheese sandwiches). \n\nMy friend made a face and kept telling me that what I\u2019m doing isn\u2019t right and that I\u2019m acting like their friend, not their parent and even teenage boys need rules to become good people. I was trying to change the subject but she wouldn\u2019t just let it go so I said \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I am NOT taking parenting advice from you.\u201d \n\nShe went quiet before yelling at me and saying that I\u2019m the weird one not her and that I can\u2019t be serious. I told her that she should probably leave and she was like \u201cI should, I didn\u2019t know you were such a mean person. I pray your kids never talk to you again when they realize how much you\u2019ve failed them.\u201d \n\nNow I\u2019m not asking for judgement about my parenting, I know how many will react, but AITA for what I specifically said to my friend about her parenting?

Expected to do the best I could at school, but no pressure to get a certain grade. Etc, etc. If we didn't comply with the simple rules, we lost the privilege of being trusted until we could earn it back. It taught me responsibility and resiliency. It also taught me that if I got in the kind of trouble that kids don't like to tell their parents about, that their would be okay if I told my mum. You've found a method that works for *you and your family*, stick with it. \n\nHonestly, it's really short sighted of your friend to complain that her parenting is going poorly in one breath, then insult yours in the next. She had it coming.", "NTA my parents were very lax with rules when I was a kid too. I was taught young to never lie, the truth will set you free. So even if I did something wrong I never got in trouble for being honest about it. My parents would explain why it was wrong but I wasn\u2019t in trouble for it and I learned. All my grandmother did was complain about how my parents raised my brother and I. She made the mistake of mentioning it to my boyfriend when he went to her house to help her since I had class all day and work right after. I was upset and when I addressed it with my grandmother she flat out said I don\u2019t like how you were raised and I said that\u2019s fine but don\u2019t you like me as a person? Yes of course I love you. Then my parents didn\u2019t do a terrible job because I ended up as a decent person. Just because it wasn\u2019t the way you raised your kids didn\u2019t make it wrong.

Because I gave them space to grow, to learn, to make their own choices and mistakes, I now enjoy a very close and loving relationship with our adult sons.\n\nI was told every nightmare scenario WOULD happen, if I didn't \"take charge and lay down the law\". I was told they'd be addicts by 14, have 15 kids on welfare by 20, I was told they'd basically be garbage people if I didn't \"lay down the law\" and make up 500000 stupid rules. I was supposed to search their rooms and read their diaries and demand their phones to search their messages, I was to make a curfew and beat whoever skipped it (like I never broke curfew, my gods). I was to take away everything they had over a little teenage attitude. I was to be \\*Draconian\\* or I wasn't doing it \"right\".\n\nThey were wrong, and so is your 'friend'. Keep raising your family how you want. This person sounds like a crummy friend.\n\nNTA for simply telling 'friend' you weren't gonna take parenting advice from her. You're under no onus to take advice from anyone. Her response was overblown.", "NTA.\n\nSometimes shock treatment is the only way to get through to rude people who ignore your diversionary cues to aggressively pursue their rudeness. This case is a great example of that principle in action.\n\nDon\u2019t let her get away with calling you mean, though; she was being rude and intrusive in judging your parenting which you did not ask for and in plowing over every effort you made to divert the conversation and she upped the rudeness after you gave her a taste of what she was dishing out. I think you can reframe the convo and move toward salvaging the friendship, if you choose, by telling her this while apologizing for hurting her feelings in the process. She may be untrainable though.", "NTA.\n\nAnd for what it's worth\n\n>Now I\u2019m not asking for judgement about my parenting\n\nYou sound like an awesome mom!", "You didn't say anything negative about her parenting.

They are my pride and joy . They are both adults now my oldest is 30 with a baby of her own and we are all still very close. \n\nI wouldn't take parenting advice from your friend either. Since being strict and what sounds like being a helicopter parent ,has gotten her is a daughter that can barely stand to be in the same house as her let alone room by the sound of it.  \n\nI also wouldn't be worried if I had hurt her precious feelings either, after her unsolicited judgemental advice, then being nasty when she was called on it where you only hinted at her parenting style. She had no qualms telling you what she thought of your parenting choices. Your boys sound great kids, feel no guilt towards your \"friend \" she doesn't deserve it. She owes you an apology NTA OP", "Imagine saying you're someone friend , then saying you pray their children wont talk to them again.

My parents had a closer approach to yours, my aunt more like your friend. \n\nMy sister and I have very close and open relationships with our parents. My cousins have spent their lives hiding things from their parents, keeping secrets, making questionable choices trying to rebel, and have mostly moved away and don\u2019t visit often. \n\nYour kids and you have a wonderful relationship and they\u2019re decent people, the proof is in the pudding that you\u2019re doing something right.", " *\u201chey mom I\u2019m ordering food you want anything?\u201d*\n\nShe's just jealous 'cause with the lack of connection with her child, HER kid would never have thought about asking their mom if they wanted food.\n\nNTA", "Lol NTA, like you said - every child is different and what works for one parent/child dynamic doesn't always work for another. She could have minded her own business, but instead she kept huffing and going on about it. You shut her down because you know you have good kids.", "NTA - you didn't ASK for any parenting advice, yet she decided that she needed to tell you how to raise/treat your children. As for what you said to her - she can dish it, but can't take it, and her last comment about how your kids will \"never talk to you/blame you\" - that was just a low blow on her part.\n\nFWIW, I also did modified \"free range parenting\" on my 2 boys, who are now fully grown adults. My parenting style was pretty much the same as yours. There were ground rules laid down, mostly because of age restrictions for certain things (I'm in Canada, so weed is legal), and both of my boys are relatively well adjusted adults who still speak to me on a regular basis.", "NTA by miles.\n\nYou kids are not your friend\u2019s kids. Her methods may not work for your family and from what you\u2019ve said, you\u2019ve done a great job so far with your kids so if it ain\u2019t broke, why fix it? She had no right telling you how to raise your sons and you tried to change the topic.\n\nSide note, you sound a lot like my mum was when I was a teen. I\u2019m 36 now and mum and I are super close. She lives with my husband and I and our \u201carguments\u201d are about silly things like what pasta shape is better, shells or penne (clearly it\u2019s shells because they scoop the sauce) or which of our cats is cuter.", "OP your friend is projecting. \n\nMy mum was the same way you are with my sister and I, she trusted us enough to make our own decisions and have autonomy. Now at 27 my mother is my best friend, i love spending time with her and I always feel comfortable talking to her for all sorts of things.  \n\nNTA. Your friend should be able to handle the criticism since she herself is criticizing you.", "NTA. Maybe you were a little harsh, but she started it by criticizing your parenting. \n\nYou sound like my parents (except the grades thing; good grades were a must in our house). They believed in talking through issues and helping us become responsible adults. My best friend when I was a young teenager had really strict and unreasonable parents (mostly her mom) and all she ever wanted to do was rebel (by doing some seriously stupid stuff sometimes). I still have a great relationship with my parents as an adult.", "NTA - misery loves company. Lots of control-freak parents who have fucked up their kids and fucked up their relationship with their overbearing rules are supremely jealous of parents who actually like their kids and whose kids actually like them. These parents want everyone else to have as many problems with their kids as they do with their own.", "She was calling you a poor parent then got defensive that you didn't think hers was all that.\n\nNTA", "NTA Sounds like you did a good job raising your boys!

Many parents, including apparently your friend, want their kids to respect their authority.

He used to joke about his grandmother being just like a prison warden.  He knew it was tough growing up in her house but he excused it as her worrying because they lived in a bad neighborhood.  It wasn't until our daughter was born that it really hit him how bad it was.  \n\nHe now struggles with parenting from time to time.  He has to constantly remind himself that he can't be too much of a friend but also not a warden either.", "Nta. I had the same situation growing up. I'm also NC with my parents. Life has been much easier since I cut that cord.", "Oh yes. I had to be sneaky too, and then got yelled at and grounded for being sneaky. Like... what the eff do you expect me to do when I cannot trust to not to get into a heap of trouble just for wanting normal teenage things? (not that I didn't miss out on a ton of things)\n\nGuess who has trust issues and wouldn't trust her parents with anything sensitive?", "Yep it means I stuck my nose where it didn't belong. I guess you can make your assumptions. I'll stick to what she actually said.", "if OP put emphasis on the \"YOU\", then I could see an argument, but they didn't. What they said is just \"I'm not taking parenting advice from anyone. My parenting style is working and I don't need advice.\"", "Yeah I'm SO tha kful that cell phones with location tracking weren't a thing when I was a teenager... my mother was crazy though as it was and I was always having to track down a payphone to let her know where I had gone. She would have airtagged me and had me tracked 24/7 if she could have. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I had a similar experience with mine. I am now 33 and I still have a long list of normal experiences I never got to have when I was younger. Like having posters on my bedroom wall, throw a party, or fly a kite.", "My parents were authoritative too. But they instilled so much fear in me that I didn't dare step out of line when I was teenager. They will tell you that I was good teenager. But inside I was a mess. My mom died when I was 10, and there was so much I kept inside while I was going through my adolescence. My dad wasn't a safe person, my stepmom wasn't a safe person, my big sister wasn't a safe person. It was awful. I journaled a lot and that probably saved my life. My relationship with my dad is pretty nonexistent these days. I can count on 1 hand the number of times he has seen my children (my door has always been open).", "Dang did you have my parents?! Exact same stuff. Went NC with both of them in my mid 30s as well.", "I could never go to my mother with anything when I was growing up, hell, I'm almost 50 and still won't do it. She always said I could but the few times I tried, she blew everything out of proportion or flat out ignored me. It would have made things easier in my life if I had been able to trust and count on her, I wouldn't have some serious scary experiences in my teens. Like a lot of Gen X, it's a wonder I didn't die in a field somewhere of alcohol poisoning.", "Same.\n\nIt's both gratifying...and heartbreaking. I wish I could 'adopt' all those other kids, but can't.", "You just described how I have to deal with my sister.\n\nYeah, I try not to be around her much, either.", "Oof, I get him. My dad was an abusive authoritarian. I thank god for my mum, who modelled gentle parenting when he wasn't around, and my best friend, who had her only child at 23 and just amazed me with her endless patience.\n\nI probably err on the side of being too soft with my kids, but that's partly because I'm scared of my own anger - they are too, which isn't great, but I keep it under control as far as I can, and have never lost it at them or laid a finger on them.", "My parents would have as well. I quit high school sports freshman year because I could get a job and have more freedom. If they were able to track me, that would have been a nightmare. I don't know if I would have made it out of my teenage years.", "I didn't have cell phone when I went away to college (they weren't very common yet) and my mom expected me to be in my room at 9pm every night to have a phone conversation with her or she'd throw an absolute fit. Little did she know, I was going right back out after that call.", "Ok, I can kinda see the thought process behind the first two, but why no kites?", "Actually, sorry, I think you mean authoritarian\u2026authoritative parenting is considered good boundaried middle-ground parenting, as opposed to overbearing and strict authoritarian parenting :-)", "It's sad but dang, you gotta do what you gotta do.", "For real. And the worst part is that I wasn't a bad kid by any stretch - my mother's idea of me doing something wrong was to leave friend A's house to go to friend B's house a block away, and forgetting to call to tell her that we had moved. \ud83d\ude44 She was just obsessively controlling, and I know she would have used it to track whether or not I was going to church and class in college.", "I had an authoritarian mother who surveilled me as much as possible during the 60's - my teenage years.  If there had been cell phones to *really* track me, I don't know if I'd have made to 18, either.", "Haha, I'm glad mine never thought of that! But one time she did call the campus police because I forgot to call when I got to the dorm after I had been home for a visit. Apparently she flipped out because it was right after Princess Di had passed away, so naturally that meant I was going to get into a wreck and die too. \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f In reality I had just bumped into a friend and when I went into their room, there were a bunch of other friends doing shots so I got, uh, distracted. But I sure as shit wasn't going to tell her that when they finally tracked me down! \ud83e\udd23", "I had classes that didn't get out until 10:20pm that were part of my major. Thankfully my parents didn't try to do that kind of shit when I was at school. Only when I was home. I do remember in HS when we would leave the cordless phone outside at our friends house. So we could call our parents on it, then they could call back to make sure we were where we said we were but leave again right after that call."]}
