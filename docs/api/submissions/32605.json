So they didn't start as one and suddenly become another, they always were there gender and had to transition so they could fully inherit the correct gender. Common terminology would be \"assigned (gender) at birth\" so e.g. a trans man might have been assigned female at birth. This recognises that other people thought they were female whilst not saying that they were! \n\nAnd it gets more complex because not everyone transitions into just male or female. Some people are non-binary (something different from both), others are gender fluid (i.e they float between different parts of gender) or a while bunch of other things too! Gender is very complex and beautiful and varied. I am cis (so my gender of female matches what the doctors signed me at birth) so I can't speak for trans people, but this is what I've learnt from listening to them. I'm happy to be corrected by a trans person with lived experience.", "I have a friend with two sons and a daughter.  She started out with two daughters and a son.  The one who transitioned is her son, a man (with a better beard than I can grow), and is referred to as \"he\".\nI figure the best thing to do when you want to know someone's gender is to ask them or otherwise find out what they say.  I don't grok non-binary, but I'm not going to argue with someone about their own identity.", "Getting cut out of wills is very common for people who transition.  It's so disheartening \n\nWhen my sister was transitioning I made a promise that if she was cut out of the will/trust I would make sure it eventually got back to her anyway", "Something tells me OP not the kinda guy that\u2019s interested in righting the wrong\u2026", "Yes, ask your lawyer about this OP. You might want to seriously consider giving her some of the inheritance, if there is a chance she could successfully contest the will. Much much easier and cheaper for you to give her some money.", "To be fair a lot of people do not particularly care about grammar and formal language on social media.", "It\u2019s Reddit, not an annual company review.", "I have had a few managing directors, old and young, that do not require formalization and being perfect. Plus this is Reddit, not their company.", "Really went into depth with that reply thankyou. And I didnt mean to offend anybody with what i said.", "That\u2019s your right of course\u2026but it is disrespecting your father/mother/parents. That might be ok with you and I\u2019m good\u2026but it\u2019s still wrong IMO.", "No big deal, but why assume that?", "I foresee this potentially causing a problem if she feels like he didn't share enough in her mind", "That\u2019s\u2026 not the question and not really relevant.", "Question is how much was joint property?  Was it enough she does not care?  I mean if the money was put in joint accounts or trusts it becomes material property.  In most states the primary house they live in and they contribute to the Houshold it becomes material assets if there is not a prenup.  But not a lawyer.", "If you inherit, it is yours to do with as you please.", "If they cut out their child because they transitioned, then yeah, I disrespect them. Because I don't respect that.", "Why is it wrong? Their wills are written for how their estate is to be disbursed. Legally, that's what is done. But just like any other gift or financial exchange, once property ownership is transferred, what's given to me is mine to do with as I please. Whether that is splitting lottery winnings from the state, swapping gifts/gift cards at Christmas so everybody gets what they want, using a bonus at work to treat my family to something nice, selling a house I've inherited, or splitting funds that I've inherited.\n\nThere's no inherent morality or immorality to obeying the spirit of a will beyond the letter of it. And some people, dead or alive, have neither given nor earned the respect of their beneficiaries, and neither would entitle them to being obeyed from beyond the grave beyond the exact limitations of inheritance law.\n\nAnd what happens if I do something they'd disapprove of? No more visits to the summer home?\n\nI don't let living bigots tell me what to do, dead ones can't boss me around, either.", "Some people, bigots specifically are a good example, get no respect because they deserve no respect.", "People that disrespect others, for their person choices that don't hurt anyone, aren't worthy of respect.", "Oh simply because he avoided the question. I would like to be wrong but seems like the will said what it said so really I\u2019m not judging", "I felt the same way by the fact he made sure to mention sister is excluded because she\u2019s trans, no mention of righting the wrong or that dad is an asshole. Almost like they find it understandable? Weird to mention otherwise imo", "Just has to be careful with financial records and IRS filings regarding \"gifts\" if he gives anyone anything over whatever the maximum value is for that year.", "Everybody is entitled to their opinion\u2026I\u2019m happy you have yours."]}
