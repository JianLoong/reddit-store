You are 100% correct - you should have had to ask him only once to not look through your wallet for him to stop. When he continued, that was him not only disrespecting you, but establishing control over you, showing you that you can\u2019t stop him. And him saying you were \u201cdefensive\u201d is a typical response of a bully when called on their behavior. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that you \u201clet him into your wallet\u201d to put your card back - you didn\u2019t give him permission to snoop.", ">he didn\u2019t like that I talked to him like that \u201cover a license picture\u201d.\n\nSo many red flags here. He doesn't understand the concept of consent. You're asking him to respect your privacy, he's refusing, and then he DARVOs you and tells you that he doesn't like your bad attitude when he intentionally crosses your boundaries.\n\nNTA and I'm guessing this isn't the only problem you've had with this guy.", ">it took me asking him THREE times for him to actually comply.\n\nNTA, your bf is.", "NTA I don\u2019t think that was defensive. I recognize the reaction you are describing. It\u2019s the frustration of being ignored when you are being very clear. I get this feeling when people don\u2019t \u201chear\u201d me decline food or won\u2019t give me back my phone or any number of small things. Then they get upset and call us unreasonable because we stopped asking nicely once we realized it was futile to do it. I\u2019m not really sure who is wrong to be honest. I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m an impatient, disrespectful person for getting frustrated and showing it in these moments. But I always wonder, why didn\u2019t you just listen the first, second or third time when I asked nicely?", "No.  But he is a dick for making fun of you and behaving this way\n  Waving your open wallet around a laundromat is a recipe for disaster. \n\nIs he always this rude to you?", "NTA wallets and bags for some strange reason feel like a sacred space. It feels vulnerable to have your wallet out in the open like that. It creates a panicked response.", "30+ years married, and from time to time I don't have cash to pay for the pizza delivery (as an example). My wife will say she has cash and to take it from her wallet in her purse. Every single time I get her purse and bring it to her. I will not go through her purse. \n\nTo me what is in a woman's purse is as personal as what's in our \"bedside table drawers\", ie a personal space. \n\nYou're NTA", "NTA, and please run! I'm sitting here pushing 70 and looking back at the train wreck of a life I've lived because I didn't run when I should have. Please don't make the same mistake.

Don't waste one second of it on people who don't respect you.\n\nETA\n\"So I said \u201ccome on now, close my wallet please\u201d and he just kept laughing at the license picture and poking fun.

Looking at the license and making fun of the picture wasnt loving and childish but what was in there that you didnt want him to see?", "NTA - but why are you using credit card to get money for laundromat? You should be using debit card for it.", "ESH \nMostly him for making fun of you and refusing to close the wallet as soon as you asked. But why did you ask him to put the card away in your wallet in the first place? He may have felt he had permission from that interaction. Why not set the coins down or dump them on him and put it away yourself since protecting your privacy is very important to you? From your other comments it sounds like he hasn\u2019t earned enough trust to handle your wallet.", "NTA. My purse is off limits because that's just too intimate a space for other people to trespass. (I don't personally really care if my husband asks to go into my purse. I don't actually care if he goes into it when I'm not right there. I trust him completely and I have nothing to hide from him in there. It would be dumb AH to leave something I did not want him to know about in so obvious a place anyway.)\n\nBut, that's not my point. If you have any manners, you already know this is considered rude as heck. I had a BF who would randomly go through my purse when I was out of teh room. So, because I was tired of being treated like a suspect, I put some razor blades in my purse. It was wrong of me and I still don't care about his injured fingers to this day. \n\nI don't go into my husband's wallet or even his phone his wallet and he does not presume that my purse and phone aren't private. Honor an individual's humanity and give them some space.

This relationship needs a bigger conversation about respecting each other's wishes on personal issues whether they agree or not. That's the essence of respect. He needs to hear that you wanting your wallet closed is not a discussion. He shows respect for your request or the relationship starts to suffer minor resentments that grow bigger and bigger. He does not grasp respect, but it may be immaturity and lack of experience. I don't think it makes him an abuser but it's an issue for all relationships  to work on and grow together . He doesn't need parameters as to when or why  he should respect your request. Him closing your wallet has no bearing on him and he shows you respect by simply doing what you ask regarding your personal property.", "NTA. This doesn't necessarily make him an abuser that you should dump ASAP, but it was a violation of boundaries and him not taking you seriously when you expressed being upset. Consider how often it feels like he does things like this, where his perception of what's worth being upset about overrules yours. If it happens somewhat regularly, have a conversation about it.", "I was on the bf's side that you were probably overreacting until you actually voiced your concerns. You did everything \"right\" here and he still didn't respect a pretty simple request. You should consider whether this behavior is a red flag or something he clearly does not understand. If he doesn't make the effort to change, cut him loose.", "YTA what the fuck are you idiots on about? Please,  begging, someone explain the worst possible scenario that could occur keeping your wallet open. Do you have your bank codes and passwords written on the inside of your wallet? Someone can open your wallet and take 1,000 pictures and not have anyone to base anything off of. That concern is absolutely fucking pointless.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, and he literally keeps missing the point. He keeps bringing up potential hypothetical situations now like \u201cok so what if you drop your wallet and it\u2019s wide open, am I supposed to leave it there since you don\u2019t want me touching your wallet?\u201d Like that is not the point!", "This is definitely not the only problem I\u2019ve had with him. A similar situation to this happened not to long ago with a picture that he took of me. It was of me laying in bed on FaceTime with him in a tanktop. I never even show my shoulders in public, let alone be seen in a tanktop. I thought the picture was just for his eyes, but then found that he posted it on his WhatsApp story for everyone to see \u201chow beautiful I am\u201d. I had to ask him 3 times to take it down, and he was like \u201cyou\u2019re right I never should have posted any picture of you\u201d. When I said he could post a more modest picture of me, he said \u201cnah I\u2019m good\u201d.

If someone hacks the debit card at a random laundry mat, it takes significantly longer to dispute and get the funds back.", "Idk, I just took money out of the ATM with any card that I had available at the moment so I can convert it to coins.", "Yeah, he is doing typical abuser, bully behavior. The point is - your wallet didn\u2019t fall on the ground - you asked him to put your card back, and he proceeded to snoop, and continued to snoop after you asked him to stop *three times*.\n\nAnd he is going to keep doing this to wear you down to make you submit to him.", "Hon, it's really important that you hear and fully grasp what I am saying to you right now:\n\nDon't date guys who don't understand consent.\n\nThis is how you end up getting SA'd.\n\nThis is not the relationship for you.", "I work in cyber security.  Flashing wallets is bad for many reasons not just someone standing near.\n\nHe disrespect you and then goes all DARVO.

Look at it this way - you've had an experience where you have come to ask internet strangers if what you were upset about is valid or not. It is 100% valid.   \n\n\nDoes your bf have a habit of making you feel invalidated? Because he's not going to stop any  time soon, judging from the other comments you have written (the photo being shared without your approval, and then his petulant response to shut down your concerns).  \n\n\nLove yourself a little bit more and dont let this guy make you question your responses. You clearly requested three times that he not do what he was doing, he persisted in making fun of and belittling you, and then hypothesised that if you were to do the same to his wallet he'd have no issue with it. Just because he has a different boundary to you doesnt mean he gets to ignore your boundaries.", "Depending on how the transaction was completed, this could be considered a \"cash advance\" on the credit card (which is what I think the other commenter is assuming), which usually comes with a transaction fee and very high interest rate (around 10% flat fee and 25%+ interest ime) that begins on the date of the withdrawal. It's usually treated as an emergency function on a card, like if you're traveling abroad and are stuck in some way without access to cash. Not something you'd expect to see people using to get $10 worth of quarters at the laundromat.\n\nEdit: OP clarified that they used the card to take money out at an ATM, which is almost definitely treated as a cash advance with fees + interest.", "Some unsolicited financial advice from an internet stranger in a different country to yours (I believe all the other NTA commenters have given you sound advice on the relationship already): Never EVER draw cash on your credit card. It is treated as a cash advance and starts attracting the exorbitant credit card interest rate from the day you withdraw until the day you settle your balance. Only use debit cards for cash withdrawals. It's honestly a shockingly bad mistake to make (I've done it twice in my life because my debit and credit cards looked the same and I wasn't paying close attention - and both times it cost me fees, interest and loss of points through my cc rewards program).", "SA isn't the only risk here. This guy doesn't respect boundaries, autonomy or consent. This is the behaviour of an abuser, and it's best to exit this relationship now, as it will become more dangerous and difficult to leave once he's succeeded in having you question your boundaries."]}
