I get this feeling when people don\u2019t \u201chear\u201d me decline food or won\u2019t give me back my phone or any number of small things. Then they get upset and call us unreasonable because we stopped asking nicely once we realized it was futile to do it. I\u2019m not really sure who is wrong to be honest. I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m an impatient, disrespectful person for getting frustrated and showing it in these moments. But I always wonder, why didn\u2019t you just listen the first, second or third time when I asked nicely?", "No.  But he is a dick for making fun of you and behaving this way\n  Waving your open wallet around a laundromat is a recipe for disaster. \n\nIs he always this rude to you?", "NTA wallets and bags for some strange reason feel like a sacred space.

This relationship needs a bigger conversation about respecting each other's wishes on personal issues whether they agree or not. That's the essence of respect. He needs to hear that you wanting your wallet closed is not a discussion. He shows respect for your request or the relationship starts to suffer minor resentments that grow bigger and bigger. He does not grasp respect, but it may be immaturity and lack of experience. I don't think it makes him an abuser but it's an issue for all relationships  to work on and grow together . He doesn't need parameters as to when or why  he should respect your request. Him closing your wallet has no bearing on him and he shows you respect by simply doing what you ask regarding your personal property.", "NTA. This doesn't necessarily make him an abuser that you should dump ASAP, but it was a violation of boundaries and him not taking you seriously when you expressed being upset. Consider how often it feels like he does things like this, where his perception of what's worth being upset about overrules yours. If it happens somewhat regularly, have a conversation about it.", "I was on the bf's side that you were probably overreacting until you actually voiced your concerns.

Please,  begging, someone explain the worst possible scenario that could occur keeping your wallet open. Do you have your bank codes and passwords written on the inside of your wallet?

I never even show my shoulders in public, let alone be seen in a tanktop. I thought the picture was just for his eyes, but then found that he posted it on his WhatsApp story for everyone to see \u201chow beautiful I am\u201d.

Only use debit cards for cash withdrawals.
