I'm going to call her Katie and her husband John. John is from a family of brothers who thrives on making fun of each other and others for entertainment. He enjoys being right and has a pretty big ego, but he values family and has the potential to be a good friend when you need him.\n\nLong story short, over the years of the time I know John and befriended him, he's always been kind of an a-hole to me. I tend to be the butt of his jokes, and he'd make me feel little for just being myself. He treats my best friend well though and she adores him, so I brilliantly thought because I cared so much for her, I decided to put up with his bs...Anyways overtime, I don't know how it happened but his jabs towards me started to become the norm and I learned to just brush it aside.\n\nWell not to go super into details about the latest incident bc Katie is a regular Redditor, but the last straw was when John said something very disrespectful, something I know I do not deserve to be spoken to in such a manner. What hurts more, was Katie staying quiet, standing by his side and not standing up for me, which is something that I finally realize that she has never done. Anywho, I got up and left their place. I decided enough was enough, and ended our friendship with a long text, wishing them two the best of luck. It wasn't the first time that I've had to address John's rude behaviors towards me. Weeks have gone by without talking, until Katie messaged me saying she cares a lot about our friendship and I really hurt the two of them by choosing to wrongly interpret his words and that he never meant what he said. His \"apology\" to me was along the lines of \"yeah I might've crossed the line earlier.\" Katie went on to say that's just how he talks to family and he sees me as one. Started to list out the favors they did for me in the past to show that he cares, but just because they stuck their necks out for me, as I did for them, does that mean I have to stand being treated with disrespect? Our other mutual close friends are pushing me to forgive and to at least talk it out with John and Katie in person, but I am done. I have made peace with ending the decade long friendship with Katie to be far far away from John. I feel so stupid for always putting their needs above my own, spending money and time that I don't have, validating myself that I'm being a good friend. Enough is enough. \n\nAlright, but hear me out, I seriously feel terrible for ending our friendship when she's entering her second trimester. She had a miscarriage before so I don't want to stress her out more than she already is. I'm worried for the baby. Should I have waited until she gave birth to end the friendship? Should I work this out with them and give the friendship another chance? Long term friends are so hard to find.", "created_utc": 1698056656, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17eh3sd/aita_for_choosing_to_end_a_15_years_friendship/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm worried I might have been the asshole for putting her in a stressful situation when she's in a sensitive headspace. Perhaps, it would've been better to end the friendship after birth. But I believe I had a pretty good reason to end the friendship. She and her husband have been terrible friends, and I've just had it with those two.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Things that were funny when I was a teenager would potentially be hurtful now. If neither Katie nor John can recognise where they went wrong either with what happened and their subsequent responses, that is a clear enough sign they won't give you the respect you deserve. \n\nYes, long term friends are hard to find but I'd rather be alone than in bad company.", "Nta treating people badly because \"they're family\" is a stupid excuse he is just an AH. Enough is enough and you've chosen what is best for you, frankly you don't owe them a conversation or anything else.", "NTA\n\nMy husband had a \"friend\" like that. Due to other issues with family, we were already in counseling when I brought up his friends' treatment of him. Long story short, after a few years of counseling, he decided that behavior didn't work for him anymore. I, of course, got the blame when he started to stand up for himself, and the friendship quickly crashed & burned when the good ol punching bag no longer wanted to play its part. People like that need a punching bag, and they don't want the trouble of looking for or creating a new one. Putting you down made BOTH of them feel better. That's why she didn't defend you, and that's why they want you back. You didn't hurt them. That's gaslighting at its finest. You took away their favorite punching bag. They were disrespectful to you. You stood up for yourself. Abusive people always alway get butthurt when their victim doesn't want to play anymore. Don't forget that.", "You're NTA. This must be a trend, because it's the third post in 2 days that I have seen where the OP is fed up with an A-H and his bullying behavior.

It's the target's fault for believing the bully repeatedly said what he said.\n\n>and that he never meant what he said.\n\nOkay, so which is it? He didn't say the clearly A-H thing, or he said it but didn't mean it?\n\nYou're better off without that rude and venomous behavior in yoir life.", "NTA\n\nTheir previous apologies and platitudes clearly meant nothing since they carried on treating you just the same.\n\nYou've texted them. You've ended the friendship. Leave it there and move on with your life with friends who don't bully you.", "Sometimes people need to know there are consequences to their actions. You're NTA and I commend you for sticking up for yourself.  That said, you could potentially give them another chance (even though you've addressed this issue before) but do it at YOUR pace not theirs and make it very clear that the joking at your expense needs to stop or the relationship will end permanantly. Be tough about it or they will continue to mistreat you.", "NTA and there is no right or wrong time to end a friendship except when you know it's right for you. This sounds like it's been a long time coming, and I hate to tell you, but John and Kate were not good friends. Don't worry about Kate's pregnancy. Whatever happens, it has nothing to do with you.", "NTA. Husband sounds like a bully but in a jokey way, which some find funny\u2014 I don\u2019t. Is Katie open to just having a friendship without her husband being involved. Like if you framed it as\u2014 \u201cI wanna stay friends, it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t feel comfortable around your husband because of the things he says to me.\u201d The health of her pregnancy is not on you.", "NTA- I ask my kids, why would you want to be friends with someone who makes you feel bad?  That is not how friends are supposed to make you feel. They should you help feel better, happy, etc. If you constantly, leave them feeling down or bad about yourself, then they are not friend worth having.\n\nI will was you the same thing, why would you want to be friends with someone you constantly makes you feel bad?", "NTA. Very few friendships stand the test of time.", "You're not an AH and they're not friends. Accept that the time and any money is both spent and gone. It's time to block them, move on and find some real friends because they're not.", "NTA it\u2019s an all too-common thing for people to endure their friends\u2019 shitty partners. It gets to the point where it\u2019s ok if they want to tie themselves to assholes but they shouldn\u2019t make excuses for them or get butthurt when other people don\u2019t want to put up with mistreatment.", "I completely understand that you don't want to stick around for John's bullshit and I realise that Katie hasn't been a good friend to you for just standing by and saying nothing whenever he put you down. \n\nHowever, I don't think it's truly fair that you ended your very long friendship via text message and refused to talk this out with Katie one-on-one. I think Katie deserves a proper conversation, but the way you describe the situation it sounds as if you were looking for a reason to get rid off her for a longer time now. \n\nYet, none of this has anything to do with the baby and you're not responsible for carrying on a friendship for the sake of someone else's stress levels, so NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
