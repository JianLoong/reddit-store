One is Black (20f), the other mixed-race (16f, Black, white, Native). We've had our fair share of sexist, racist, homophobic or just plan nosy/ignorant comments over the years though the positive, sweet and kind reactions far far outweigh those bigots just to be clear. But the comments can wear on you. Luckily, as the girls have gotten older, we almost never hear those comments any more (they best not, our daughters are fierce!). \n\nUntil just under 3 weeks ago. I was with our 16yo shopping in Target. She's tall (6'), just under my height (6'1\") and looks much older than 16 (often mistaken as a 20-1 year old). Anyway, we were walking & talking about what we needed and dividing up the shopping. A woman (white, 40something) walking in front of us turned and gave us a nasty look. My daughter and I were a bit taken aback, not sure what we said that resulted in that look. We just went our way and didn't think anything more about it (well, much :) . \n\nThen we were in the grocery section and this woman approached me (my daughter was a couple aisles down) and said \"I think that's disgusting. Shameful\" or something to that effect. I was honestly confused and must have looked it. Then to 'clarify' she said \"It's disgusting that someone your age is with such a young woman. You are old enough to be her father or more!\" Then said something other nasty stuff worth of MTG. I was seriously stunned and just stood there thinking. \n\nI then said very loudly because I was getting angry \"I am her father.. you racist pervert!\"\n\nGot a lot of looks from others including my daughter who had just walked up. She responded with something like \"well, I didn't know, how was I supposed to?\" to which I responded \"Yeah, you didn't know, that's why you keep your f'ing mouth shut and f'ing racist perverted shit to yourself\" (I'm paraphrasing, I was stuttering more than that and I probably said \"f'ing more than twice). She left in a huff and the people around looked quite shocked (I'm not sure they heard her comments).\n\nAnother woman smiled and said \"that was quite harsh\" and when I got home and told my husband (who I'm not exaggerating when I say he would never say a mean word to or about anyone). He said I was the AH (though not using those words of course) and should have just corrected her and walked away. Now I've been feeling I was a bit harsh and overreacted in public. I've seen her once after (downtown... it's a small town) and my husband thinks I should go apologize for my harshness next time I see her.", "created_utc": 1670016663, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zaycwe/aita_for_calling_a_stranger_a_racist_pervert/", "score": 101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am less lovely and suggest that you should continue loudly asking her why she is such a racist pervert every time you see her until you get a satisfactory answer (spoiler alert: you won't). \n\nNTA great job dad", "NTA\n\nI'm a firm believer in loudly shaming people who cross lines and act like this.

Hopefully your quite strong reaction will keep her from harassing other people in the future.", "NTA\n\nMy only thought for why she would do this is she thought she could help a young girl escape a potentially unhealthy relationship, which if that was what she was thinking, she did it in a completely wrong way. Also, if you were with a white 16- to 20-year-old girl, I bet she would not have said a thing. You called her out, it's not your fault she decided to be AH.", "NTA.\n\nSure, you unloaded on her a bit, but she earned it.", "Racists never deserve an apology. NTA", "NTA and brav-ucking-o!!\n\nPeople need to get out of other peoples business.\n\nNow they might think longer next time before butting in on a stranger's shopping trip.", "NTA\n\nYeah there probably were other ways you could\u2019ve handled it, but she f*ed up by being judgemental and rude. She got called out for her behaviour (rightly so) and then tried to fain innocence, like it\u2019s ok to talk to stranger like that in the first place?\n\nYou might\u2019ve been harsh but it wasn\u2019t undeserved, hopefully she learnt a valuable lesson. And as I\u2019m sure you know calmly putting people in their place can be faaaar more satisfying (and is guilt free), but I totally get it being a last straw and I will NOT side with a self-righteous bigot. Don\u2019t beat yourself up over it, but don\u2019t give the bigots the satisfaction of getting a rise out of you either.\n\nEdit to add: the phrase \u201cf*ck around and find out\u201d applies nicely here", "NTA. She should've minded her business and not made assumptions, honestly its more telling about her that that's what her thoughts first jumped to.", "NTA - some people need to learn to mind their own business and quit sticking their long noses into places they are not welcome.\n\nI am sure if she asked a polite inquiring question about your \"beautiful daughter\" you would have responded politely and introduced yourself and your daughter.\n\nShe presumed too much and got called out.

It went down hill afterward, you should have stopped there. \nI\u2019ve had a similar situation with my daughter when she was in Uni. She is very tall , looks older than her age, I\u2019m only 23 yrs older and look younger than I am. I\u2019ve gotten some really dirty looks from women in restaurants and bars when I was with my daughter , so many times. My daughter thought it was hilarious and encouraged their assumptions.

She fucked up big time. Don't apologise to her. \n\nGood on you for calling out her bigoted bullshit.", "NTA. People should think twice before saying things like that unprompted and sometimes this is the only way they will learn to do so. Not because the goodness in their heart but because being called out in public is scary.\n\nYour husband's opinions come from a good place, at the same time not apologising or feel bad is the right move.
