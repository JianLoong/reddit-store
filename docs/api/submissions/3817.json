One is Black (20f), the other mixed-race (16f, Black, white, Native). We've had our fair share of sexist, racist, homophobic or just plan nosy/ignorant comments over the years though the positive, sweet and kind reactions far far outweigh those bigots just to be clear. But the comments can wear on you. Luckily, as the girls have gotten older, we almost never hear those comments any more (they best not, our daughters are fierce!). \n\nUntil just under 3 weeks ago. I was with our 16yo shopping in Target. She's tall (6'), just under my height (6'1\") and looks much older than 16 (often mistaken as a 20-1 year old). Anyway, we were walking & talking about what we needed and dividing up the shopping. A woman (white, 40something) walking in front of us turned and gave us a nasty look. My daughter and I were a bit taken aback, not sure what we said that resulted in that look. We just went our way and didn't think anything more about it (well, much :) . \n\nThen we were in the grocery section and this woman approached me (my daughter was a couple aisles down) and said \"I think that's disgusting. Shameful\" or something to that effect. I was honestly confused and must have looked it. Then to 'clarify' she said \"It's disgusting that someone your age is with such a young woman. You are old enough to be her father or more!\" Then said something other nasty stuff worth of MTG. I was seriously stunned and just stood there thinking. \n\nI then said very loudly because I was getting angry \"I am her father.. you racist pervert!\"\n\nGot a lot of looks from others including my daughter who had just walked up. She responded with something like \"well, I didn't know, how was I supposed to?\" to which I responded \"Yeah, you didn't know, that's why you keep your f'ing mouth shut and f'ing racist perverted shit to yourself\" (I'm paraphrasing, I was stuttering more than that and I probably said \"f'ing more than twice). She left in a huff and the people around looked quite shocked (I'm not sure they heard her comments).\n\nAnother woman smiled and said \"that was quite harsh\" and when I got home and told my husband (who I'm not exaggerating when I say he would never say a mean word to or about anyone). He said I was the AH (though not using those words of course) and should have just corrected her and walked away. Now I've been feeling I was a bit harsh and overreacted in public. I've seen her once after (downtown... it's a small town) and my husband thinks I should go apologize for my harshness next time I see her.", "created_utc": 1670016663, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zaycwe/aita_for_calling_a_stranger_a_racist_pervert/", "score": 194, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And as I\u2019m sure you know calmly putting people in their place can be faaaar more satisfying (and is guilt free), but I totally get it being a last straw and I will NOT side with a self-righteous bigot.
