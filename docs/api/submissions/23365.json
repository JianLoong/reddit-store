{"id": 23365, "submission_id": "15cazd4", "title": "AITA For refusing to pay to repurchase a skateboard for my neighbors son?", "selftext": "I (39M) live next door to a family of 3. Their son (recently 19) CONSTANTLY leaves his skateboard on my side of the drive. I've asked time and time again for him to kindly move it, as it's a hassle for me to have to Pick it up every morning to put it back on their lawn whenever I'm about to drive my car. Yet nothing changed. Its been an ongoing issue since the kid got the skateboard. \n\nI don't mind him skating, I mind his stuff being left in my cars path and me having to move HIS things. \n\nSo this morning, I woke up, and saw him outside just sitting on his front doorstep. I stuck my head out of the window and pointed to the board, kindly asking if he could move it. He nodded.\n\n30 minutes later, I'm ready to set off for the day. So I get out, get in my car. And I reverse out. \n\nI'd hoped that he had moved his board. I deep down knew he hadnt. And i actually ended up reversing right over it.\n\nHis parents are knocking at my door every half hour or so asking me to \"give them money\" for their sons new board. I've told them I asked him to move it several times... for months... and not to leave it in direct path of my vehicle. Am I the Asshole for refusing to rebuy it for him?", "created_utc": 1690582672, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15cazd4/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_to_repurchase_a/", "score": 282, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He needs to buy his own skateboard and learn to take care of his things. You gave him more than enough chances to learn this the easy way.\n\nNTA\n\nEdited to add: Even if he was 9, I'd still say NTA. I took better care of my stuff when I was 9.", "Let me get this straight - a 19 year old man left his skateboard behind your car, and couldn't be bothered to move it when you asked him to? And then his parents - not the 19yo man himself - started to bother you about paying for it? Is that right?\n\nNTA.\n\nThe 19yo man, who has achieved the age of majority and should know better than to leave his toys lying around in random places, is the A H. As are his parents.", "NTA. It was left on *your* property, and you told them to move it. It\u2019s not reasonable for anyone to have to keep checking their own driveway to see if someone has left sports equipment in a place they had been told not to. Choices have consequences.", "NTA, do not give them money. Time for him to learn a valuable lesson.", "NTA, say no one more time and then report them to the police for harassment and trespassing.", ">His parents are knocking at my door every half hour or so asking me to \"give them money\"\n\nNow I know where their son gets his attitude from. No way would I give them a dime. NTA", "Imagine OP arriving home work, tired ah, instead of parking and getting inside, there's the extra step of getting out of the car and moving the 19 yo child skate. Now imagine OP leaving late and stressed for work and... Same crap.\nNTA op, if he can't afford a replacement, he should have taken good care of his toy.", "NTA. They\u2019re delusional lol. He\u2019s 19, not 7 so if he\u2019s too lazy to move it from YOUR driveway that\u2019s a him problem.", "NTA, kid is an adult, if he wants you to pay for board he can come talk to you about it. His parents can beat it. I don\u2019t think you should pay. I wouldn\u2019t. I have a neighbor that constantly has her kids on my property, I\u2019ve asked many many times to knock it off. Nothing worked, until I started keeping any and all toys, balls, hockey pucks, hockey sticks etc. I would deposit them in the trash and make sure they were no longer useful for anything.\nI no longer have neighbor kids in my yard.", "NTA OP!\n\nIf their ADULT son isn't able to take proper care of his own things, even if you have asked him REPEATEDLY to do so, then this isn't your fault.\n\nCall it bad parenting, purposefully leaving it there to get a new skateboard, being obtuse, ... in any case this was his own doing, not yours!", "NTA. Send them a bill for getting your car realignment done. Skateboard damage, you know?", "NTA", "NTA assuming that that section of the driveway is officially yours like you state. That's on the kid for leaving it on your property. It's not like you did it intentionally.", "NTA. Your neighbors suck. It's almost like they wanted you to run over it. Are they requesting a suspicious amount of money?", "Oh, man... this is a tough one. But, I think this is a nta thing.\n\n The kid needed a natural consequence and he got one. \n\nA 19-year-old should have known not to leave his skateboard in a random place. It isn't your problem he didn't pick it up.", "[deleted]", "NTA, you\u2019ve warned him multiple times, this was the last straw.", "NTA but I would have kept or binned the board after the third time. If he keeps leaving it on your property, he clearly is gifting it to you", "Demanding payment for property that has been destroyed is neither harassment nor trespassing.", "19 year old adult\u2019s skateboard.", "Not tough at all. He gave multiple warnings. They're ridiculous asking him to pay. Also, he's 19, not a child. NTA.", "False.  You are not allowed to harass or trespass to collect a legal debt, much less a dubious one.", "It CAN be. The relevant question is HOW you do it.", "And the OPs story doesn't mention either harassment nor trespassing. The OP says \"knock on my door and ask to 'give them money'\". Neither harassment nor trespassing.", "he\u2019s a 19 year old man jesus NTA", "NTA. The skateboard was on your driveway and you had asked him to remove it. \n\nThat being said, you know the kid leaves his board on your driveway. Don't you look when you back up? It could have been a neighbourhood child there. I have to believe you knew it was there. BUT I STILL DON'T BLAME YOU. \n\nYou don't owe them a penny.", "NTA. The lesson for them all here is FAFO. He\u2019s an adult and needs to start acting like one. Sounds like mum and dad have picked up after him his whole life.", "NTA this kid is a jerk, lust like mom and dad.", "LOL.  This is hilarious. \nNTA.  The 19 yo man needs to learn to take care of his shit.  Tell his parents to pound sand.", "NTA. In the teaching world, we call this a \"natural consequence.\"", "Anyone else thinking that this kid actually *wanted* his skateboard run over so he could force his neighbor to get him a new more expensive replacement? It's the only reason I can think of he would keep leaving it where anyone with half a brain could see it was in danger of being destroyed even after being warned multiple times.", "I bet he won't leave his stuff in your driveway again. NTA!", "\u201c I told Nate for the 17th time to move his skateboard and he said he would so I assumed he did\u201d", "NTA", "NTA. Good grief he's 19 not 9!  He needs to grow up and take responsibility of his things. He didn't put it somewhere safe (after you reminding him tons of times) and it's his fault it's broken. Guess he can be more careful in the future. Do NOT rebuy him a skateboard.", "NTA.\n\nYou asked him, multiple times, not to leave it there, he didn't listen.  You asked him to move it the day you reversed over it, even though he knew you'd be using your vehicle soon, he still didn't move it.\n\nYou owe them/him nothing.", "NTA. He continually left it on your property. In the way. FAFO", "NTA. I would have very much enjoyed back the heck over it!!  Play stupid games, win stupid prizes!", "NTA\n\nHe fucked around and found out.", "You told him the morning of to move it.  He said he would but failed to do so.\n\nit was his carelessness.  the som was at fault.  \n\nNTA", "NTA that whole family needs some consequences.", "NTA. You asked him to move it. He said he would. You trusted that he did. The loss is entirely on him.", "First of all, his parents have zero skin in the game because he is an adult. I would tell them this is none of their business.\n\nIf he wants to ask OP he is welcome to do so. But the answer is no.\n\nNTA.", "Definitely NTA. It was on YOUR property and you were nice about it many times.", "I literally cannot believe this is a 19 year old, I am dying that he got his parents to come speak to op NTA", "At that point, I'd have been hard pressed not to yeet that skateboard as hard as I could into their lawn.", "Demanding payment for personal property that has been knowingly, and apparently intentionally, abandoned on someone else's real property is hilarious, and would get them laughed out of court (even small claims). And knocking and making demands every half hour after being told to stop absolutely is harassment, and entering someone else's real property after being told not to absolutely is trespassing.", "Knocking on someone's door repeatedly to hassle them about a claim that they have zero interest in is harassment.", "They're doing it every half-hour. Doing it once is one thing, but at that rate? Definitely harassment. And if OP had told them to go away/leave him alone at any point then it's indeed trespassing as well, since they're not welcome on his property.", "They have zero claim even if (big if) OP is responsible. The claim belongs to the adult skateboard owner. So hassling them for $$ they have zero claim for is harassment.", "NTA. Tell his parents that you will check if his board damaged your car", "NTA", "Of course you\u2019re NTA", "NTA\n\nIf a 19 YEAR OLD ADULT doesn't want to keep his shit off your property and it gets destroyed then he can act like a grown up, get a job(if he doesn't have one) and use his paycheck to buy a new one", "NTA. I wouldn't have been as nice as you are. It would have gone into the trash probably the second time I collected it.", "He is 19 and his parents are asking?", "NTA\n\n\u201cActually the board caused some damage to my cars paint. Let\u2019s exchange insurance info\u201d", "NTA. Tell your neighbors to GFT.", "Yeah, justice for 9 year olds!  My toddler put his little skateboard back in the garage all by himself today.  Not sure why this is a difficulty for a whole grown adult.", "A kid would have to pay face down on the ground the be as low as a skateboard though.", "How is this tough?  He\u2019s 19 not 5.", "This is what I was wondering. Does the 19yo even care about the skateboard? He doesn\u2019t seem to take good care of it, and he can\u2019t be bothered to ask OP if he\u2019d replace it himself. I have a feeling the parents are more worried about replacing the skateboard than the 19yo.", "Because mommy and daddy never made him do anything. You can tell because they\u2019re the ones going to OP instead of the son. \n\nHe still would be 110% right no matter who came over, but it really is telling about their dynamics that it was the parents.", "After running to mommy and daddy to make the mean ol' OP pay for his skateboard, I don't think he's earned the title of adult.", "They don't have to be as low as the skateboard, only lower than the back end of the car so you can't see them when they dart behind your car as you are backing out.", "You are ignoring \"say no one more time.\"  Everyone else understood this to mean ban then from the property and tell them to stop contacting you.  Harassment and trespassing.", "If they feel OP owes for the skateboard they can file in small claims court. \n\nOP is NTA."]}
