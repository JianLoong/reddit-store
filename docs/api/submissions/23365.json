{"id": 23365, "submission_id": "15cazd4", "title": "AITA For refusing to pay to repurchase a skateboard for my neighbors son?", "selftext": "I (39M) live next door to a family of 3. Their son (recently 19) CONSTANTLY leaves his skateboard on my side of the drive. I've asked time and time again for him to kindly move it, as it's a hassle for me to have to Pick it up every morning to put it back on their lawn whenever I'm about to drive my car. Yet nothing changed. Its been an ongoing issue since the kid got the skateboard. \n\nI don't mind him skating, I mind his stuff being left in my cars path and me having to move HIS things. \n\nSo this morning, I woke up, and saw him outside just sitting on his front doorstep. I stuck my head out of the window and pointed to the board, kindly asking if he could move it. He nodded.\n\n30 minutes later, I'm ready to set off for the day. So I get out, get in my car. And I reverse out. \n\nI'd hoped that he had moved his board. I deep down knew he hadnt. And i actually ended up reversing right over it.\n\nHis parents are knocking at my door every half hour or so asking me to \"give them money\" for their sons new board. I've told them I asked him to move it several times... for months... and not to leave it in direct path of my vehicle. Am I the Asshole for refusing to rebuy it for him?", "created_utc": 1690582672, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15cazd4/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_to_repurchase_a/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He needs to buy his own skateboard and learn to take care of his things. You gave him more than enough chances to learn this the easy way.\n\nNTA\n\nEdited to add: Even if he was 9, I'd still say NTA. I took better care of my stuff when I was 9.", "Let me get this straight - a 19 year old man left his skateboard behind your car, and couldn't be bothered to move it when you asked him to? And then his parents - not the 19yo man himself - started to bother you about paying for it? Is that right?\n\nNTA.\n\nThe 19yo man, who has achieved the age of majority and should know better than to leave his toys lying around in random places, is the A H. As are his parents.", "NTA. It was left on *your* property, and you told them to move it. It\u2019s not reasonable for anyone to have to keep checking their own driveway to see if someone has left sports equipment in a place they had been told not to. Choices have consequences.", "NTA, do not give them money. Time for him to learn a valuable lesson.", "NTA, say no one more time and then report them to the police for harassment and trespassing.", ">His parents are knocking at my door every half hour or so asking me to \"give them money\"\n\nNow I know where their son gets his attitude from. No way would I give them a dime. NTA", "Imagine OP arriving home work, tired ah, instead of parking and getting inside, there's the extra step of getting out of the car and moving the 19 yo child skate. Now imagine OP leaving late and stressed for work and... Same crap.\nNTA op, if he can't afford a replacement, he should have taken good care of his toy.", "NTA. They\u2019re delusional lol. He\u2019s 19, not 7 so if he\u2019s too lazy to move it from YOUR driveway that\u2019s a him problem.", "NTA, kid is an adult, if he wants you to pay for board he can come talk to you about it. His parents can beat it. I don\u2019t think you should pay. I wouldn\u2019t. I have a neighbor that constantly has her kids on my property, I\u2019ve asked many many times to knock it off. Nothing worked, until I started keeping any and all toys, balls, hockey pucks, hockey sticks etc. I would deposit them in the trash and make sure they were no longer useful for anything.\nI no longer have neighbor kids in my yard.", "NTA OP!\n\nIf their ADULT son isn't able to take proper care of his own things, even if you have asked him REPEATEDLY to do so, then this isn't your fault.\n\nCall it bad parenting, purposefully leaving it there to get a new skateboard, being obtuse, ... in any case this was his own doing, not yours!", "NTA. Send them a bill for getting your car realignment done. Skateboard damage, you know?", "NTA", "NTA assuming that that section of the driveway is officially yours like you state. That's on the kid for leaving it on your property. It's not like you did it intentionally.", "NTA. Your neighbors suck. It's almost like they wanted you to run over it. Are they requesting a suspicious amount of money?", "Oh, man... this is a tough one. But, I think this is a nta thing.\n\n The kid needed a natural consequence and he got one. \n\nA 19-year-old should have known not to leave his skateboard in a random place. It isn't your problem he didn't pick it up.", "What's a board cost?  You willing to have enemies next door for that price?\n\nTossing the board in their yard or kicking out of the way and pressing the kid seems a lot less assholey.\n\nI'm going with YTA.\n\nI'll give a little ESH because the kid is 19, not 9.  But you're 39, not 19.", "NTA, you\u2019ve warned him multiple times, this was the last straw.", "NTA but I would have kept or binned the board after the third time. If he keeps leaving it on your property, he clearly is gifting it to you", "Demanding payment for property that has been destroyed is neither harassment nor trespassing.", "19 year old adult\u2019s skateboard.", "Not tough at all. He gave multiple warnings. They're ridiculous asking him to pay. Also, he's 19, not a child. NTA.", "False.  You are not allowed to harass or trespass to collect a legal debt, much less a dubious one.", "It CAN be. The relevant question is HOW you do it.", "And the OPs story doesn't mention either harassment nor trespassing. The OP says \"knock on my door and ask to 'give them money'\". Neither harassment nor trespassing."]}
