One year ago my dad started dating his gf, Mary and two months ago she moved in with him.\n\nSome time ago my breasts started growing. I was happy as I was the last one in my class, but it turned out to be a problem because if I don't have a bra, my breasts and what's worse nipples are clearly visible if I have thin t-shirt (like during PE class) or if I'm cold. Some of my classmates even started noticing it and it was embarassing. I don't want everybody to be able to stare at my breasts. Obviously, I asked my mum to buy me a bra but she told me that there's no need as my breasts are still very small and that she'll buy me one in a few months. I was upset but I knew that if I'll continue this topic, mum will get upset. (We don't have money problem or anything by the way, she just gets upset easily.)\n\nSo when I was spending time at dad's, I asked dad for some money and Mary if she will go with me and help me buy a bra. (I didn't want to ask dad to go and help me choose one because I think it would be weird.) Mary agreed and helped me buy not one but three different bras which are great and I'm much more comfortable during PE classes and in general.\n\nBut my mum is angry with me. She told me that she's my mum and not Mary and that I had no right to ask Mary about buying me bras if she didn't agree. She says that I am doing things behind her back.

There is no reason for her to refuse that.", "NTA. \n\nsome adults get weird about their kids needing new clothing items like bras cuz it reminds them their kid is growing up. And your mom probably barely notices your developing body (what she describes as small breasts) - but kids in your class (and you) definitely do- hormones and puberty is a weird time. \n\nAll in all you deserve to be comfortable and I\u2019m glad you have other adults who will take you to get items for you to feel and be comfy. \n\nYou also asked your mom before going to Mary and she refused. So it\u2019s on your mom to be more receptive to your needs going forward.", "NTA. Your dad's girlfriend sounds more sensible and caring than your own mother. Your mom is jealous of gf.

Telling my mother I needed a bra and her telling me I didn't. We went back and forth over this for a few days until I decided, fine, you don't think I need a bra, you don't want to take me to buy a bra, I'll make a bra.\n\nAt this point, my mother thought I was being overlydramatic and finally relented. We went to the store and what do you know, I had to start off in a B because an A was too small. She was shocked.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. You know your body and what you need. Sometimes it's hard for parents to see their children growing. They still see them as children. \n\nYou asked an adult you trusted to help you with something you needed after your mother refused. She's probably thinking you won't listen to her but she needs to remember she needs to listen to you as well. Especially when it comes to your body.\n\nNTA", "NTA\nYou asked your mom and she refused. She doesn\u2019t get to control what you do when you are with your dad. There is nothing wrong with what you did beyond your mom being jealous for no reason. You asked her first and she didn\u2019t want to.", "Nta.", "NTA. You did go to her first. She ignored your feelings. She caused this not you.", "NTA. Your mom is out of line for not agreeing to take you to get bras when YOU asked. What were you to do?  I'm glad you have a the kind of relationship with Mary where you felt you could ask for help.", "NTA", "NTA you asked your mom to help with a need which was also a problem she ignored you so you asked someone else who you knew would help. Tell mom if she doesn't want you to go to others for help then she needs to listen and act on your needs/problems immediately especially if its a problem such as this or you will undoubtedly ask Mary for help again.", "NTA  I\u2019m a stepmother and when my stepdaughter wanted to get a bra I texted her mom to give her the opportunity to take her. Had she refused, I would have taken her. You gave your mom first shot. She didn\u2019t take it.", "NTA - your mom dropped the ball on a parenting moment when you needed her. That\u2019s on her, not your fault. You\u2019re taking care of yourself plain and simple. \n\nI\u2019d would tell your mom: \u201cI asked you for help that I needed, and you said no. So I asked Mary for help instead. If you want to be my mother, help me\u201d", "NTA. You have to be comfortable with your body, and your mum wasn't understanding that. Good for you advocating for yourself!", "Nta. I asked my sisters to take me. When my daughter gets to that point she can ask whoever she wants", "NTA. You asked your mum and she refused.", "NTA and it makes me wonder what else your mum does like this. My mother was... not good, and one of the more minor things was refusing to buy me bras to the point a friend ended up giving me a wired bikini top to use instead. This was like a small chip of ice on top of a very big iceberg.\n\nI'm glad you have your dad and Mary.", "NTA. Your mom was given the opportunity and chose not to take it. I would even argue that your mom had an obligation to help you with this and didn't. Good for your dad and stepmom for stepping up.", "Two conclusions here:  NTA and MTA. Both. The M is for mum and not Mary", "NTA. The comments from boys at school are annoying enough. I dont want to even imagine what it would be like without a bra and in a thin shirt \ud83d\ude2c", "NTA. \n\nWhen teens start going through puberty, it can be absolutely horrendous. You asked your mum first, because you were feeling uncomfortable with what was happening at school (which is totally understandable). Your mum ignored your feelings.", "NTA!\n\nYou're a teen and your body is changing according to *its* schedule, not your mom's. Dad's GF was awesome and I'm glad she's treating you like her own kid.", "NTA, you did go to your Mom first and she decided she wasn't doing it.  Not sure if you communicated why you needed a bra, but it doesn't matter.  Mom did this not you, your certainly NTA here.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like your mom isn't ready to recognize or accept the fact that you are growing up.   You can't force her to do so, but you don't have to be prevented from getting what you need because of it.   If she doesn't like your father's GF having that role in your life, then she needs to be willing to step up and take it, even if she doesn't love it.", "Yeah, this is really sad. NTA. Your mum should make you feel comfortable and talk with you about puberty and the changes that come with it. My mum bought a really expensive bra for me when I barely had boobs because, just like you, I felt really uncomfortable and I felt they were noticeable (and the only shop close by only had expensive bras in such small sizes). Mary is awesome and if your mum complains about what Mary does, maybe she should try to be a bit more like Mary.", "NTA.\n\nYour mum had the chance to help and she chose not to. The natural result is that you'll find help elsewhere. You had every right and reason to ask Mary, and it's good that she was able and willing to help.\n\nIf your mum is angry, the only person she has to be angry with is herself.", "NTA   \n\n\nI'm in my 60s, but I recall that when I was 12 my mum bought me what was termed a 'training  bra' - it gave enough coverage to avoid embarrassment when wearing my school uniform shirt.", "NTA my girl!!  A girl needs a woman to guide them just as a boy needs a man.  As a former boy who never had a man, I deeply sympathize with your plight.", "NTA\n\nOmg this is too sad, and my heart goes out to you. This is a perfect example of a parenting failure on your mothers part and in no way your fault. You did everything correctly  and in no way is her reaction to do with you or what you needed to do to seek out your own comfort and peice of mind. Step mom for the win, and also a win for your dad because it sounds like it's a no brainer why he upgraded. Your mother needs to educate herself a bit more and also seek help or therapy for her insecurities and dealing with her past. I hope things get better and brighter for you in the future.", ">She told me that she's my mum and not Mary and that I had no right to ask Mary about buying me bras if she didn't agree.\n\nYou have every right to ask your father for money for clothing. If his girlfriend helped you purchase those items of clothing, that was very nice of her. If your mom doesn't like it, that's too bad. That's how custody splitting works. Your mom gets upset really easily huh? NTA. Good luck with your mom.", "NTA. Your body, your choice. If you want to wear a bra, wear one. If your mother is weird enough to reject your wish to go shopping with you, she has no right to be upset. You're lucky that your Dad's gf was understanding and helped out where your mother failed.", "NTA. You expressed your discomfort and asked for a reasonable solution to help you feel more secure so you can focus on what is important at school. Your mom was dismissive of your concerns and Mary was not. Obviously she is jealous that you seem to trust Mary but that is her own fault because she ignored your concerns and expected you to continue being self-conscious in order to abide by her timeline.", "Nta. Your mom wasn\u2019t taking your real concerns into account. I\u2019m glad your dad and his girlfriend were able to help.", "NTA.\n\nYou asked your mum first and she shot you down and wouldn't take you to get what you need.\n\nMary and your dad seem reasonable and Mary took you to get what you needed when you asked.\n\nYou're now at an age where you can voice what you want and who you feel comfortable confiding in.", "NTA your mother was negligent and that is on her. I\u2019m so sorry that you were denied the support (literally) that you deserve and need.", "Your ok. Your mom is being a AH. She isn't ready for you to grow up but that's her issue not yours", "NTA -  I would have a talk with your mum about how uncomfortable you have been in school if you haven\u2019t already and remind her that you went to her first for support with this and she said no. I\u2019d use this experience to emphasise to your mum that if she wants you to approach her first for these kinds of issues in future then you need to know that she will take you seriously and respect your views and opinions. \n\nIn an ideal world, breasts would not be sexualised in any way and seeing nipples through a shirt would be no different if it was a boy or a girl but we don\u2019t live in an ideal world and teens can be brutal about changing bodies and there needs to be a level of realism and your comfort and self esteem needs to be prioritised. The irony is, most teens who try to make others feel uncomfortable about their body are doing so because they themselves feel uncomfortable in their body and they think pointing out other people\u2019s bodies distracts from their own! \n\nAlso If your step mum didn\u2019t know that you had already asked your mum and been told no, I\u2019d apologise to her in case she is now getting a row from your mum about it. However if she knew and supported you to get a bra anyway then no need to apologise to her.", "NTA! I know a lot of girls whose parents took some time to realize their kids needed bras or razors, for example. Maybe grownups don't realize how dramatic those body changes are for kids/young teens. In any case, you absolutely deserve to be comfortable and not have others staring at your breasts. I hope your mum realizes she was in the wrong here!", "NTA NTA NTA. I'm so sorry your mum let you down like this, and glad you have Mary to help you.", "NTA. It also sounds like your dad was on board with all of this, so her argument that you\u2019re in the wrong because she\u2019s your mom and she didn\u2019t agree, doesn\u2019t hold weight. Your dad has just as much say as she does. Your mom chose to disregard your discomfort, but I think it\u2019s wonderful that you have another adult woman in your life that you can go to with these kinds of things. You sound like a good kid, with a good head on your shoulders. Everything will turn out okay in the end.", "NTA I had the same struggle at your age. My mum didn't want me to have a bra, didn't want to let me shave my legs, didn't want me to use tampons. She had no real reasoning", "NTA.  Your father had custody at the time and you and Mary had his permission.", "NTA  When your adolescent kids asks for a bra, that's the time they need a bra, regardless of whether or not mom thinks there's anything to put in it.  Working up the courage to ask for a bra is an indication that not having one is more bothersome/embarrassing than asking and shopping for one. Your mom screwed up.", "NTA.", "Your mother ignored your feelings, and you decided to take matters into your own hands, which I totally agree with if you feel uncomfortable, your mother should respect that don\u2019t feel bad about it, hon", "NTA: You needed something, you were refused. So you went to some who would oblige. If your mom is so offended then tell her that she should have been the one to do it, but didn't take you seriously enough.", "NTA. It was your mother\u2019s (or father\u2019s, but I get why you chose his GF \ud83d\ude42) place to buy you a bra, but she failed to do that. Once your breasts start to grow, you need support & coverage. I don\u2019t understand why your mother didn\u2019t take care of that. I had training bras when I was still flat chested. Kudos to Mary for recognizing & rectifying the situation.", "NTA. Your mom doesn't get to decide when you're ready to wear a bra. That's so out of line for her to do wtf?? My niece started wearing little sports bras WAY before she even started developing because everyone in her class had already started. It just made her more comfortable and more in line with the social norms at her school.", "NTA. Any loving (and smart) mom would buy them if their daughter asked. Heck even a training bra is better than nothing! She needs to control her anger and listen to your needs. If not, she shouldn\u2019t get upset when you turn to Mary instead.", "NTA.\nYou need bra now not in a few months your mun is been ridiculous.", "Nta.", "Your mother is toxic and dumb. NTA.", "NTA It\u2019s your body, and you get to decide what makes you comfortable. There was nothing wrong with getting help from Mary in buying a bra. It\u2019s just your mom\u2019s insecurities that made her say that. \n\nAs an important side note, there\u2019s nothing wrong or bad about nipples, even when they show a bit through your clothes. I get that other kids might tease or even bully you if they notice, but nipples are just a totally normal part of the body, no big deal.", "For real.  OP\u2019s situation is pretty much what \u201ctraining bras\u201d are meant for.  More to keep the nips private than to provide support.  Also to get used to putting the dang things on and taking them off before there is added weight.", "This is a perfect example of how things should always work, even in an imperfect world. It's sad to see how mixed priorities become when feeling are hurt in the past and how some can't learn to move forward to help themselves and those they love in the present. Way to go, stepmom FTW! Lol", "If OP hasn\u2019t started having periods, I hope she\u2019s at Dad\u2019s when it kicks off.  If Mom is that weird about bras, I wouldn\u2019t want to find out how she handles OP drawing first blood.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019ll follow up with a similar bra story. My mother bought me two sports bras when I was 10, and never again purchased another bra for me. By the time I was 13, you bet those bras were in tatters, but they were all I had. \n\nOP, you did a good thing by advocating for yourself! Keep it up.", "Well said", "Absolutely \ud83d\udcaf", "Yea, but I\u2019d honestly kind of hate to see her mom stepping up just to win in some perceived competition with Mary, because I can just imagine how that would go.", "Lol I\u2019ve never seen a first period described as \u201cdrawing first blood\u201d before. Love that. Will be stealing it, tyty."]}
