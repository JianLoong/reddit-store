I spend one week with mum and then one week with dad, as for holidays and summer break, it's 50-50, too. One year ago my dad started dating his gf, Mary and two months ago she moved in with him.\n\nSome time ago my breasts started growing. I was happy as I was the last one in my class, but it turned out to be a problem because if I don't have a bra, my breasts and what's worse nipples are clearly visible if I have thin t-shirt (like during PE class) or if I'm cold. Some of my classmates even started noticing it and it was embarassing. I don't want everybody to be able to stare at my breasts. Obviously, I asked my mum to buy me a bra but she told me that there's no need as my breasts are still very small and that she'll buy me one in a few months. I was upset but I knew that if I'll continue this topic, mum will get upset. (We don't have money problem or anything by the way, she just gets upset easily.)\n\nSo when I was spending time at dad's, I asked dad for some money and Mary if she will go with me and help me buy a bra. (I didn't want to ask dad to go and help me choose one because I think it would be weird.) Mary agreed and helped me buy not one but three different bras which are great and I'm much more comfortable during PE classes and in general.\n\nBut my mum is angry with me. She told me that she's my mum and not Mary and that I had no right to ask Mary about buying me bras if she didn't agree. She says that I am doing things behind her back. I didn't want to, but I didn't want to wait few months because I needed a bra now, because I had problem with going to school.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679487272, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11yh7tc/aita_for_asking_my_dads_girlfriend_to_help_me_buy/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your stepmother helped you solve a problem.  \n\nIf you discuss this further with mom,  point out that your peers AND OTHERS are sexualizing your body as it's developing and you want to be proactive and stay safe. Maybe mom will grasp that her daughter is trying to stay safe in an unsafe world.", "NTA - If your mom didn\u2019t want someone else buying you bras, she should\u2019ve bought you bras. There is no reason for her to refuse that.", "NTA. \n\nsome adults get weird about their kids needing new clothing items like bras cuz it reminds them their kid is growing up. And your mom probably barely notices your developing body (what she describes as small breasts) - but kids in your class (and you) definitely do- hormones and puberty is a weird time. \n\nAll in all you deserve to be comfortable and I\u2019m glad you have other adults who will take you to get items for you to feel and be comfy. \n\nYou also asked your mom before going to Mary and she refused. So it\u2019s on your mom to be more receptive to your needs going forward.", "NTA. Your dad's girlfriend sounds more sensible and caring than your own mother. Your mom is jealous of gf. Now you know who you can go to if you need someone. Too bad it can't be your mother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Telling my mother I needed a bra and her telling me I didn't. We went back and forth over this for a few days until I decided, fine, you don't think I need a bra, you don't want to take me to buy a bra, I'll make a bra.\n\nAt this point, my mother thought I was being overlydramatic and finally relented. We went to the store and what do you know, I had to start off in a B because an A was too small. She was shocked.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. You know your body and what you need. Sometimes it's hard for parents to see their children growing. They still see them as children. \n\nYou asked an adult you trusted to help you with something you needed after your mother refused. She's probably thinking you won't listen to her but she needs to remember she needs to listen to you as well. Especially when it comes to your body.\n\nNTA", "NTA\nYou asked your mom and she refused. She doesn\u2019t get to control what you do when you are with your dad. There is nothing wrong with what you did beyond your mom being jealous for no reason. You asked her first and she didn\u2019t want to.", "Nta.", "NTA. You did go to her first. She ignored your feelings. She caused this not you.", "NTA. Your mom is out of line for not agreeing to take you to get bras when YOU asked. What were you to do?  I'm glad you have a the kind of relationship with Mary where you felt you could ask for help.", "NTA", "NTA you asked your mom to help with a need which was also a problem she ignored you so you asked someone else who you knew would help. Tell mom if she doesn't want you to go to others for help then she needs to listen and act on your needs/problems immediately especially if its a problem such as this or you will undoubtedly ask Mary for help again.", "NTA  I\u2019m a stepmother and when my stepdaughter wanted to get a bra I texted her mom to give her the opportunity to take her. Had she refused, I would have taken her. You gave your mom first shot. She didn\u2019t take it.", "NTA - your mom dropped the ball on a parenting moment when you needed her. That\u2019s on her, not your fault. You\u2019re taking care of yourself plain and simple. \n\nI\u2019d would tell your mom: \u201cI asked you for help that I needed, and you said no. So I asked Mary for help instead. If you want to be my mother, help me\u201d", "NTA. You have to be comfortable with your body, and your mum wasn't understanding that. Good for you advocating for yourself!", "Nta. I asked my sisters to take me. When my daughter gets to that point she can ask whoever she wants", "NTA. You asked your mum and she refused.", "NTA and it makes me wonder what else your mum does like this. My mother was... not good, and one of the more minor things was refusing to buy me bras to the point a friend ended up giving me a wired bikini top to use instead. This was like a small chip of ice on top of a very big iceberg.\n\nI'm glad you have your dad and Mary.", "NTA. Your mom was given the opportunity and chose not to take it. I would even argue that your mom had an obligation to help you with this and didn't. Good for your dad and stepmom for stepping up.", "Two conclusions here:  NTA and MTA. Both. The M is for mum and not Mary", "NTA. The comments from boys at school are annoying enough. I dont want to even imagine what it would be like without a bra and in a thin shirt \ud83d\ude2c", "NTA. \n\nWhen teens start going through puberty, it can be absolutely horrendous. You asked your mum first, because you were feeling uncomfortable with what was happening at school (which is totally understandable). Your mum ignored your feelings.", "NTA!\n\nYou're a teen and your body is changing according to *its* schedule, not your mom's. Dad's GF was awesome and I'm glad she's treating you like her own kid.", "NTA, you did go to your Mom first and she decided she wasn't doing it.  Not sure if you communicated why you needed a bra, but it doesn't matter.  Mom did this not you, your certainly NTA here.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like your mom isn't ready to recognize or accept the fact that you are growing up.   You can't force her to do so, but you don't have to be prevented from getting what you need because of it.   If she doesn't like your father's GF having that role in your life, then she needs to be willing to step up and take it, even if she doesn't love it.", "Yeah, this is really sad. NTA. Your mum should make you feel comfortable and talk with you about puberty and the changes that come with it. My mum bought a really expensive bra for me when I barely had boobs because, just like you, I felt really uncomfortable and I felt they were noticeable (and the only shop close by only had expensive bras in such small sizes). Mary is awesome and if your mum complains about what Mary does, maybe she should try to be a bit more like Mary."]}
