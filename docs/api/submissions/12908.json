One year ago my dad started dating his gf, Mary and two months ago she moved in with him.\n\nSome time ago my breasts started growing. I was happy as I was the last one in my class, but it turned out to be a problem because if I don't have a bra, my breasts and what's worse nipples are clearly visible if I have thin t-shirt (like during PE class) or if I'm cold. Some of my classmates even started noticing it and it was embarassing. I don't want everybody to be able to stare at my breasts. Obviously, I asked my mum to buy me a bra but she told me that there's no need as my breasts are still very small and that she'll buy me one in a few months. I was upset but I knew that if I'll continue this topic, mum will get upset. (We don't have money problem or anything by the way, she just gets upset easily.)\n\nSo when I was spending time at dad's, I asked dad for some money and Mary if she will go with me and help me buy a bra. (I didn't want to ask dad to go and help me choose one because I think it would be weird.) Mary agreed and helped me buy not one but three different bras which are great and I'm much more comfortable during PE classes and in general.\n\nBut my mum is angry with me. She told me that she's my mum and not Mary and that I had no right to ask Mary about buying me bras if she didn't agree. She says that I am doing things behind her back.

Telling my mother I needed a bra and her telling me I didn't.

We went to the store and what do you know, I had to start off in a B because an A was too small. She was shocked.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. You know your body and what you need. Sometimes it's hard for parents to see their children growing. They still see them as children. \n\nYou asked an adult you trusted to help you with something you needed after your mother refused.

She doesn\u2019t get to control what you do when you are with your dad. There is nothing wrong with what you did beyond your mom being jealous for no reason.

Your mom is out of line for not agreeing to take you to get bras when YOU asked. What were you to do?  I'm glad you have a the kind of relationship with Mary where you felt you could ask for help.", "NTA", "NTA you asked your mom to help with a need which was also a problem she ignored you so you asked someone else who you knew would help. Tell mom if she doesn't want you to go to others for help then she needs to listen and act on your needs/problems immediately especially if its a problem such as this or you will undoubtedly ask Mary for help again.", "NTA  I\u2019m a stepmother and when my stepdaughter wanted to get a bra I texted her mom to give her the opportunity to take her.

That\u2019s on her, not your fault. You\u2019re taking care of yourself plain and simple. \n\nI\u2019d would tell your mom: \u201cI asked you for help that I needed, and you said no. So I asked Mary for help instead. If you want to be my mother, help me\u201d", "NTA. You have to be comfortable with your body, and your mum wasn't understanding that. Good for you advocating for yourself!", "Nta. I asked my sisters to take me. When my daughter gets to that point she can ask whoever she wants", "NTA. You asked your mum and she refused.", "NTA and it makes me wonder what else your mum does like this. My mother was... not good, and one of the more minor things was refusing to buy me bras to the point a friend ended up giving me a wired bikini top to use instead. This was like a small chip of ice on top of a very big iceberg.\n\nI'm glad you have your dad and Mary.", "NTA. Your mom was given the opportunity and chose not to take it. I would even argue that your mom had an obligation to help you with this and didn't. Good for your dad and stepmom for stepping up.", "Two conclusions here:  NTA and MTA. Both. The M is for mum and not Mary", "NTA. The comments from boys at school are annoying enough. I dont want to even imagine what it would be like without a bra and in a thin shirt \ud83d\ude2c", "NTA. \n\nWhen teens start going through puberty, it can be absolutely horrendous. You asked your mum first, because you were feeling uncomfortable with what was happening at school (which is totally understandable). Your mum ignored your feelings.", "NTA!\n\nYou're a teen and your body is changing according to *its* schedule, not your mom's. Dad's GF was awesome and I'm glad she's treating you like her own kid.", "NTA, you did go to your Mom first and she decided she wasn't doing it.  Not sure if you communicated why you needed a bra, but it doesn't matter.  Mom did this not you, your certainly NTA here.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like your mom isn't ready to recognize or accept the fact that you are growing up.   You can't force her to do so, but you don't have to be prevented from getting what you need because of it.   If she doesn't like your father's GF having that role in your life, then she needs to be willing to step up and take it, even if she doesn't love it.", "Yeah, this is really sad. NTA. Your mum should make you feel comfortable and talk with you about puberty and the changes that come with it. My mum bought a really expensive bra for me when I barely had boobs because, just like you, I felt really uncomfortable and I felt they were noticeable (and the only shop close by only had expensive bras in such small sizes). Mary is awesome and if your mum complains about what Mary does, maybe she should try to be a bit more like Mary.", "NTA.\n\nYour mum had the chance to help and she chose not to. The natural result is that you'll find help elsewhere. You had every right and reason to ask Mary, and it's good that she was able and willing to help.\n\nIf your mum is angry, the only person she has to be angry with is herself.", "NTA   \n\n\nI'm in my 60s, but I recall that when I was 12 my mum bought me what was termed a 'training  bra' - it gave enough coverage to avoid embarrassment when wearing my school uniform shirt.", "NTA my girl!!  A girl needs a woman to guide them just as a boy needs a man.  As a former boy who never had a man, I deeply sympathize with your plight.", "NTA\n\nOmg this is too sad, and my heart goes out to you. This is a perfect example of a parenting failure on your mothers part and in no way your fault. You did everything correctly  and in no way is her reaction to do with you or what you needed to do to seek out your own comfort and peice of mind. Step mom for the win, and also a win for your dad because it sounds like it's a no brainer why he upgraded. Your mother needs to educate herself a bit more and also seek help or therapy for her insecurities and dealing with her past. I hope things get better and brighter for you in the future.", ">She told me that she's my mum and not Mary and that I had no right to ask Mary about buying me bras if she didn't agree.\n\nYou have every right to ask your father for money for clothing. If his girlfriend helped you purchase those items of clothing, that was very nice of her. If your mom doesn't like it, that's too bad. That's how custody splitting works. Your mom gets upset really easily huh? NTA. Good luck with your mom.", "NTA. Your body, your choice. If you want to wear a bra, wear one. If your mother is weird enough to reject your wish to go shopping with you, she has no right to be upset. You're lucky that your Dad's gf was understanding and helped out where your mother failed.", "NTA. You expressed your discomfort and asked for a reasonable solution to help you feel more secure so you can focus on what is important at school. Your mom was dismissive of your concerns and Mary was not. Obviously she is jealous that you seem to trust Mary but that is her own fault because she ignored your concerns and expected you to continue being self-conscious in order to abide by her timeline.", "Nta. Your mom wasn\u2019t taking your real concerns into account. I\u2019m glad your dad and his girlfriend were able to help.", "NTA.\n\nYou asked your mum first and she shot you down and wouldn't take you to get what you need.\n\nMary and your dad seem reasonable and Mary took you to get what you needed when you asked.\n\nYou're now at an age where you can voice what you want and who you feel comfortable confiding in.", "NTA your mother was negligent and that is on her. I\u2019m so sorry that you were denied the support (literally) that you deserve and need.", "Your ok. Your mom is being a AH. She isn't ready for you to grow up but that's her issue not yours", "NTA -  I would have a talk with your mum about how uncomfortable you have been in school if you haven\u2019t already and remind her that you went to her first for support with this and she said no. I\u2019d use this experience to emphasise to your mum that if she wants you to approach her first for these kinds of issues in future then you need to know that she will take you seriously and respect your views and opinions. \n\nIn an ideal world, breasts would not be sexualised in any way and seeing nipples through a shirt would be no different if it was a boy or a girl but we don\u2019t live in an ideal world and teens can be brutal about changing bodies and there needs to be a level of realism and your comfort and self esteem needs to be prioritised. The irony is, most teens who try to make others feel uncomfortable about their body are doing so because they themselves feel uncomfortable in their body and they think pointing out other people\u2019s bodies distracts from their own! \n\nAlso If your step mum didn\u2019t know that you had already asked your mum and been told no, I\u2019d apologise to her in case she is now getting a row from your mum about it. However if she knew and supported you to get a bra anyway then no need to apologise to her.", "NTA! I know a lot of girls whose parents took some time to realize their kids needed bras or razors, for example. Maybe grownups don't realize how dramatic those body changes are for kids/young teens. In any case, you absolutely deserve to be comfortable and not have others staring at your breasts. I hope your mum realizes she was in the wrong here!", "NTA NTA NTA. I'm so sorry your mum let you down like this, and glad you have Mary to help you.", "NTA. It also sounds like your dad was on board with all of this, so her argument that you\u2019re in the wrong because she\u2019s your mom and she didn\u2019t agree, doesn\u2019t hold weight. Your dad has just as much say as she does. Your mom chose to disregard your discomfort, but I think it\u2019s wonderful that you have another adult woman in your life that you can go to with these kinds of things. You sound like a good kid, with a good head on your shoulders. Everything will turn out okay in the end.", "NTA I had the same struggle at your age. My mum didn't want me to have a bra, didn't want to let me shave my legs, didn't want me to use tampons. She had no real reasoning", "NTA.  Your father had custody at the time and you and Mary had his permission.", "NTA  When your adolescent kids asks for a bra, that's the time they need a bra, regardless of whether or not mom thinks there's anything to put in it.  Working up the courage to ask for a bra is an indication that not having one is more bothersome/embarrassing than asking and shopping for one. Your mom screwed up.", "NTA.", "Your mother ignored your feelings, and you decided to take matters into your own hands, which I totally agree with if you feel uncomfortable, your mother should respect that don\u2019t feel bad about it, hon", "NTA: You needed something, you were refused. So you went to some who would oblige. If your mom is so offended then tell her that she should have been the one to do it, but didn't take you seriously enough.", "NTA. It was your mother\u2019s (or father\u2019s, but I get why you chose his GF \ud83d\ude42) place to buy you a bra, but she failed to do that. Once your breasts start to grow, you need support & coverage. I don\u2019t understand why your mother didn\u2019t take care of that. I had training bras when I was still flat chested. Kudos to Mary for recognizing & rectifying the situation.", "NTA. Your mom doesn't get to decide when you're ready to wear a bra. That's so out of line for her to do wtf?? My niece started wearing little sports bras WAY before she even started developing because everyone in her class had already started. It just made her more comfortable and more in line with the social norms at her school.", "NTA. Any loving (and smart) mom would buy them if their daughter asked. Heck even a training bra is better than nothing! She needs to control her anger and listen to your needs. If not, she shouldn\u2019t get upset when you turn to Mary instead.", "NTA.\nYou need bra now not in a few months your mun is been ridiculous.", "Nta.", "Your mother is toxic and dumb. NTA.", "NTA It\u2019s your body, and you get to decide what makes you comfortable. There was nothing wrong with getting help from Mary in buying a bra. It\u2019s just your mom\u2019s insecurities that made her say that. \n\nAs an important side note, there\u2019s nothing wrong or bad about nipples, even when they show a bit through your clothes. I get that other kids might tease or even bully you if they notice, but nipples are just a totally normal part of the body, no big deal.", "For real.  OP\u2019s situation is pretty much what \u201ctraining bras\u201d are meant for.  More to keep the nips private than to provide support.  Also to get used to putting the dang things on and taking them off before there is added weight.", "This is a perfect example of how things should always work, even in an imperfect world. It's sad to see how mixed priorities become when feeling are hurt in the past and how some can't learn to move forward to help themselves and those they love in the present. Way to go, stepmom FTW! Lol", "If OP hasn\u2019t started having periods, I hope she\u2019s at Dad\u2019s when it kicks off.  If Mom is that weird about bras, I wouldn\u2019t want to find out how she handles OP drawing first blood.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019ll follow up with a similar bra story. My mother bought me two sports bras when I was 10, and never again purchased another bra for me. By the time I was 13, you bet those bras were in tatters, but they were all I had. \n\nOP, you did a good thing by advocating for yourself! Keep it up.", "Well said", "Absolutely \ud83d\udcaf", "Yea, but I\u2019d honestly kind of hate to see her mom stepping up just to win in some perceived competition with Mary, because I can just imagine how that would go.", "Lol I\u2019ve never seen a first period described as \u201cdrawing first blood\u201d before. Love that. Will be stealing it, tyty.", "NTA \n\nIf bra shopping meant that much to your mom, she should have taken you. It was nice of your dad's girlfriend to help you out.", "NTA. I'm a teacher and I teach students around your age, and I've seen girls in your situation. If I had the money to spare, I'd get them training bras to help because that's just a rough part of puberty. You want to be comfortable, and I know I would be embarrassed at school in your situation. Your mom said no, and honestly you have a right to bond with your dad's girlfriend who may be a step-mother figure in your life! Your mom is likely feeling insecure and has conflicted feelings about it - don't be too hard on her, but don't feel bad about going to Mary!", "NTA, and good on you for reaching out to an adult who was responsible enough to understand your need for it. Glad your dad and yours dads gf could support you and what you needed.\nYour mum missed her opportunity to do this with you. That\u2019s not your fault OP. That\u2019s on her.\n\nSport bras are also super comfy OP if you haven\u2019t gotten any yet!", "NTA, of course, and I\u2019m glad you had other options.

She needs to focus on the issues at hand, even if she doesn\u2019t feel like she needs to.  \n  \nDon\u2019t let any creepers send you PMs about this OP.  I always worry about the younger folks when these subjects come up.  Even though so far everyone is being good.  Good job, Redditors.", "NTA, your mom's response should have been along the lines of \"while I don't think you need a bra yet, you have a valid concern. Let's go get bras.\"", "NTA - Maybe your mother is old and her memory not so great so she doesn't remember how very uncomfortable it is to go braless in early phases of breast development. You did nothing wrong though and your chest will thank you for this and you'll be so much more comfortable. I hope your mother gets over her weirdness soon.", "Nta. My mom also dismissed me and said I didn\u2019t need them. I did. I had friends with less than me who wore training bras. glad you are able to feel comfortable now. I wonder if this is some strange stint to try to prolong growing up. Either way\u2026.

I\u2019m glad Mary came through for you. \n\nRefusing to buy bras for a child who needs it should be considered the same as not getting them underpants.", "NTA.  It was time with your dad and Mary was very nice to assist.   Mom refused to buy one and you were uncomfortable with the changes in your body and how others were reacting.

And you shut me down, you didn't listen to my concerns so I went to someone who did listen to me and was willing to help. I didn't do anything wrong, I'm 13, I'm a teenager now and my body is changing and I wanted a bra. This has nothing to do with you, it was about me and my body.

For most women, bras are a necessity we don't really like (it's the first thing I take off when I get home and I don't have massive breasts). Being older (over 30-40 years old and especially after having kids), our breast are not as \"nice\" and \"perky\" as they used to be and a lot of us might be very happy to go braless if we had small, \"fresh\" boobs. So it's \"possible\" that to your mom, she just couldn't get what the issue is because she's had all her adult life to deal with her breasts, how they've felt, how bras have felt and how her boobs have changed over the years and maybe, she just didn't want you to worry about such things yet. Doesn't mean she's right. Even if you're young, you know your body, and you listened to yourself.\n\nYou advocated for yourself and I for one, am proud of you!\n\nEdit: BTW, I was 13 when I got my first bra.

She may not like that you're growing up but she needs to get over herself and let go of being so damn controlling.\n\nPro tip: as a teenager I loved wearing t-shirt bras because they were thick enough my nipples could never show through no matter what I was wearing.", "NTA. You asked your mom first and she turned they down despite you clearly needing a basic necessity. She can't then complain you asked someone else for help.", "NTA. It sounds like your mom gets mad no matter what you do.", "NTA. Your mum really let you down there", "You asked your mom first.  She said no.  \n\nSo you asked Mary... and she agreed, which is awsome of her.  \n\nYour mom... is in no position to get angry about this.  You did the right thing, and you're NTA.  Neither is Mary.", "NTA.. you asked your mom and she declined.. her problem..", "NTA - the \"its a mothers job\" for bra's/periods/etc just continue to stigmatize nature human functions and changes, and whomever the child is comfortable with should be able to assist.", "NTA - you gave your mother every opportunity to help with a situation that was causing you distress and putting you at risk of being embarassed at school. I am glad Mary could help you.  \n\nI am also sad for you that you don't feel comfortable pushing your mother about things that matter to you and matter less to her.", "Your mom had the opportunity and passed. You know your body and what it needs. You took the initiative and asked another trusted adult for help. NTA", "Dad approved apparently and he\u2019s as much of a parent as your mom. Obviously NTA.", "Haha you know you\u2019re not. Your mom has issues and it\u2019s one of the hardest lessons for us in life to realize not only are our parents flawed, but we can\u2019t fix them or hold out hope they\u2019ll change. It\u2019s great you reached out for a resource to help you when you needed it and you should be proud of yourself for knowing what you needed and providing it for yourself. Your mom is probably feeling jilted by the dynamic you may have with a new parent. That\u2019s really normal and common, but it\u2019s not great how she went about communicating that with you. Unfortunately your mom\u2019s reaction was crappy towards you, but just realize that she\u2019s hurting and it\u2019s not from anything that is your fault. It\u2019s her job as an adult to take care of herself and a lot of adults don\u2019t. Keep your boundaries where you can with your mom and keep doing what you\u2019re doing!", "NTA. Your mom was very insensitive in this situation. If you felt the need for a bra... who would know better?", "NTA \n\nYour mom is just jealous cause she\u2019s your dad gf. Does your mom get mad that your school teacher is teaching you math and not her? Does she get mad that your barber cuts your hair and not her? No she don\u2019t cause she gets the context. She\u2019s only mad cause Mary is your dad gf, I bet if Mary was just a friend mom or someone less significant she wouldn\u2019t care. OP you\u2019re allowed to find guidance and mentorship from other people outside of your family and if your mom can\u2019t understand that. Then she doesn\u2019t have your best interest at heart", "NTA\n\nMary is awesome.  Mom...not so much.", "I remember my own moms reluctance to buy me a proper bra when I was in middle school, her uncomfortably taking me to a Deals and Discounts to get me a few. \n\nI don't think you're the AH, she's having a hard time with you growing", "NTA, your mom was not meeting your needs, and you\u2019re at a time in your life where kids can be especially mean and cruel, you needed help to feel safe and she didn\u2019t do that. She\u2019s likely upset because she wanted to be the one to help you buy your first bra but it\u2019s about what you and your body need. Training bras are not expensive and are made to stretch so they grow with you a bit, I don\u2019t know what the issue was.", "NTA, and stay kind to Mary. She may not be your mother, but she sounds like someone you trust, who is worthy of your trust.", "NTA. You asked your mom and basically refused, so you asked your dad's girlfriend and she agreed to help you. I'm happy that you had her to go to since your mom refused.", "Sometimes mothers have a real issue with their daughters growing up as it can make them realize they are getting older. I had this issue with my mom and bras also. I had a year of constant issues with how I was developing and a mother who flat refused to acknowledge it and the problems it caused me and the body issues I took a few years to get over.\n\nNTA - you did right. The person who said you gave your mom first refusal is right. The \"you cannot\" is her trying to control your body and not allow you the autonomy to feel comfortable with / in yourself.\n\nIf she does something like confiscate the bras, double up on tops, get tanks and layer (if you can). This is what I had to do. Middle of a Texas summer and I'm out there in two tanks and a shirt just to not have issues.", "Definitely NTA. Your mom may be reeling from the situation and mishandling her feelings. Be compassionate where you can but don't accept fault for surviving.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou asked your mum.  She said no.  You went to the next trusted woman and she took care of you.  You're good.  \n\nYour mum sucks here because she should remember how it was like.  A lot of adults tend to forget what being a young teenager is like.  We get caught up in our day to day of running our homes and raising you kids that we just forget that we went through the same things you went through.  Most adults aren't malicious about this, we simply don't think about it in the same terms you will.  To us it isn't that big of a deal compared to what we have to deal with and keep track of.  But it is to you, and your feelings are valid.  Your mum, and the rest of us parents of teenagers do need to take a step back, and remember what it was like.  I know I try with my girls, but ultimately fail a lot since I am a dad and didn't go through what they go through.  I hope your mum learns that this was important to you and she missed the opportunity to be there for you.  Hopefully she's learned this lesson and will do better next time you need her.", "My dad absolutely refused to buy me bras and had custody of me most of the time. I know what it's like to be developing and not have the proper undergarments. The first thing I did was go to my mom when she finally had me for the summer and ask for a bra. She took me to a really nice lingerie store and got me some practical bras and it was totally against my dad's wishes but I had to do what I had to do. Also it's really uncomfortable to go from no bra to wearing one everyday after you are fully developed. You're NTA op.", "Your mom is TAH, she's just jealous of your dad's gf who seems to be more of a mom than your biological mom.", "You did not go behind your moms back. You asked your dad. You had a need and asked your parents and one of them was able to meet that need. Mary being the one actually taking you shopping doesn't matter, as I am betting your dad knew what was going on. \n\nGood on Mary for being there for you and good on you for asking for her help. \n\nYour mom is most likely upset that your dads GF did something for you. You asked your mom for something you ***needed***, she said no, so you had your dad solve the issue. The AH here is your mom. \n\nNTA", "Nta. You're mom sounds borderline abusive.", "NTA. My mom wouldn\u2019t buy me a bra either and it SUCKED. It got to the point where I only felt comfortable wearing big sweatshirts. I have two little girls now and will happily buy them training bras/regular bras before they need them so they never have to feel the way I did. I\u2019m glad you have another woman in your life who can help you out! Good job asking her.", "NTA. Your mother doesn't understand that she no longer controls your feelings or your body. It is sometimes hard for parents to accept that, but that's her issue. She doesn't have to agree on WHY you feel uncomfortable or embarrassed. She doesn't need to agree that your problem is *important enough to her to be solved.* She just needs to help you through it or not. She chose not to.\n\nIf you have a problem, you will go to her for help. If she decides to ignore your issue, you'll take it to your other parents. Because you still need help, even if she doesn'twant to give it. That is completely appropriate. You didn't go behind your mother's back. If anything SHE turned her back on you you! You simply don't want to have your nipples commented on by your classmates. And that is completely reasonable. Your body image is not your Mother's, to control.\n\nSadly, mothers like this rarely change. So be ready for her to continue to try to take ownership of you until you're 18. I'm glad you have a good relationship with your Dad and his GF.", "NTA is your mother a narcissist? I\u2019d want my daughter to be comfortable in her skin.", "I'm a dad, I'm proud to have been there for my daughter when this came up. Her mum fortunately doesn't have a problem.\n\nIf you ever need help, it sounds like your dad AND Mary are good for it. I suggest you include your dad as well. It might help lessen the internal conflict your mother experiences about being able to be happy for you.", "NTA", "NTA as a stepmom I would absolutely do this if my stepdaughter needed me to. It is likely your mom feels her decision was overturned by someone who didn't raise you but it is unreasonable for her to expect you to not want a bra at your age and Mary acted as a proxy for your Dad she didn't suggest the idea herself.", "This. Your mom dropped the ball and is now embarrassed that another mom jumped in-line to fill her place.", "I agree.  NTA.\n\nBut, I wonder if OP can tell Mom, \"I am asking for your help with this.  This is your opportunity.  If you refuse, I will ask Dad and Mary.\"  Will Mom just freak and yell at OP *or* actually step up and help OP?", "Mom got her chance and failed badly.", "My SIL bought my niece her first \u201ebra\u201c (more like a sports bra type) when she was 10 because she was curious about it. Did she need it? No. Did it hurt? Also no. No need to make a big deal out of this imo. \nAlso OP NTA of course", "While it's not a bra story, it's so similar: I told my mom when I was 12, that I can't see properly and need glasses. She said I didn't need them, only wanted them bc I once said having glasses looks cool. She only took me to get my eyes checked after I couldn't read the board from the first desk, and my teachers kept calling her about it. Lo and behold, my eyes were -1.25 and -1.5. Still annoyed about this after 20 years.", "My (normally awesome) mom pulled the same thing when I pointed out I needed a bra. I hit puberty really young (got my period at 8), so by 11 I needed an actual bra (I was a C by 12, and maybe 100 lbs, so they were very obvious). I think she just didn't want to see me growing up that fast, and was freaked out by the implications of having an 11 year old with an adult's body. She hit puberty late and barely needed a bra as an adult, so having a preteen with very noticable boobs was not something she was prepared for.", "?", "Definitly not.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

It won't be received for what it is and will likely be perceived and taken in a more threatening manner. If her \"mother\" is still harboring such ill feelings about the situation she is in currently at this stage of her life, then it will only be taken as an opertunity for another unhealthy outlet to release her anger and insecurity. She would be better suited to talk with her father alone about what happened and request his help in making sure it doesn't happen again in the future, and also avoid the chance of things becoming abusive or even violent. Next would be an open line of communication between her mother and stepmother if, for nothing else, the happiness, health, and safety of their daughter. This would do wonders for all involved.

Reactions like this create lasting memories that will influence behaviors and tendencies in the future, especially as she is heading into a very emotional and stressful point in her life. This is the part of a young girls life as she starts to become a woman when she needs a stronger woman to show her how, support and coach her, and be emotionally available to her. To be able to feel free and able to approach a parent is important for a child, and her mother just damaged her perception about the ability to be able to do so from this point on. She might as well just push her daughter twords her father and stepmother from now on.", "My mom has small breasts.
