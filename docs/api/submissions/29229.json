You don't have to 'be respectful'.

So the girlfriend dates your cousin and then leaves him for your cousin's dad? That is absolutely deplorable. And a 42 year old dating a 19 year old is fucking yuck.", "NTA your uncle and grandparents are disturbing. I suggest you show this thread to your cousin and dad and go into a deeper discussion about why your uncle is not ok. \nBetraying your sono like that is sick. Supporting it is sick. Going out with someone your son\u2019s age is sick. Going out with someone barely legal at 42 is also kinda sick and very telling. Berating family for their boundaries to defend your golden child is also sick. \nYou have a good dad, hope he keeps you away from your uncle.", "NTA Uncle is a sick man.", "NTA.  What they want isn't respect, it's covering up the skeletons in their closet.  They can go pound sand.\n\nYou and your dad have the right of it.", "NTA\n\nYour grandparents suck so much. Ask them why is you not attending his party a betrayal of family but him stealing his son's teenage gf is not a betrayal of family?", "NTA \n\nAsk your grandparents what their thoughts are on their son sleeping with a teenager. \nA teenager who was their grandchild's girlfriend. \nAsk them where that behaviour is placed on their scale of respectability.", "NTA\n\nThe thing with grandparents is their generation were taught things and made to accept things that just are horrible.  You don't respect people because of their age, you respect people because they have earned your respect.  What people seem to always forget is that respect is hard to earn, but very easy to lose.", "NTA I wouldn't go to your weirdo uncle's party either. Childhood sweethearts? So I'm guessing he met/knew her when she was a child, and now that he's legal he's dating her? Cute.", "NTA You don\u2019t have to take sides but you also don\u2019t have to pretend to respect people whom have let you down.", "Am I reading this right? Did this 42 year old man steal a 19 year old girl from his own son? Are they still together? This is all sorts of fucked up, I would stay so far away from this whole situation. NTA.", "NTA. Uncle is a bad person, you shouldn't be expected to \"respect\" him.", "Oh wow, was that his son's g/f??? That's despicable, absolutely NTA a big fat NTA", "NTA tell grandma and grandpa it shows allot about their character as people to defend cheaters and those who harm their kid.", "i\u2019m sorry, maybe you would be more respectful of your adult relatives if they didn\u2019t date their children\u2019s barely not a child anymore romantic partners? maybe ask your grandparents if they\u2019re also looking to hook up with some barely legal tail and if that\u2019s why they\u2019re cool with it (note: do not do this) or if it\u2019s only okay and cool if it\u2019s a teenager their own child is dating (seriously do not).\n\ngross, i guess, is what i\u2019m saying. sometimes, with some people, when they\u2019re mad at you, that means you did the right thing. it sounds like your grandparents are that type of person, and you and your dad did good. nta.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
