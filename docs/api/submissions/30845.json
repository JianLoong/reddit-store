I told her that it doesn't really happen anymore other than for a punishment because I'm older so I'm trusted to be at home alone.\n\n\nYesterday, my therapist rang my mom because I apprently what i said was a safety issue and my parents could get in trouble for it. I didn't know what I said was concerning i just answered her questions honestly I didn't mean for anything bad by it.\n\nMy mom told my dad and they both got really angry and said I shouldn't be telling other people about things like that. I just don't understand because they always said that most parents do it so their kid doesn't get hurt while they're away I didn't know I wasn't supposed to tell anyone. I feel really bad about it. \n\nMy parents have grounded me until I \"learn my lesson\", they said I could've got them in a lot of trouble.

Also tell your therapist that you have been grounded for telling them the truth. If your parents don't want you to tell a therapist that they have abused their child, I guess they shouldn't abuse their child.", "NTA. Holy hell. That\u2019s not good. Where I live, that\u2019s illegal. I\u2019m pretty sure your parents would be charged with neglect.\n\nYou are not wrong for talking about something that your parents used to do that traumatized you. Never. I think your parents are only angry because they know that what they did was wrong and they\u2019re trying to get you to cover it up so they\u2019re not discovered.\n\nI do think that you need to continue therapy, but I\u2019d be a little concerned about your therapist continually talking to your parents if you know it\u2019s gonna affect you negatively. If you think your therapist can be trusted, talk to them about what happened and ask them for suggestions that do not involve speaking to your parents. If you think you need a new therapist, get one.\n\nProtect yourself and process everything you need to. You got this, OP.", "NTA. As someone suggested I would recommend telling your therapist your parents grounded you with no end in sight, how your dad talks to you etc. Nothing about how your parents are treating you is okay. Good parents don\u2019t lock their kids in their room for hours at a time because they can\u2019t afford childcare or whatever reason they\u2019re giving you. I beg you not to turn against your therapist because they told your parents what you\u2019ve said. Yes it sucks that you\u2019re now in trouble at home because of it, but all you did was tell the truth. And if things get bad at home, your therapist may be the only person who can and will help you. Good luck OP, and I\u2019m sorry your parents are treating you like this, you deserve better.", "NTA.\n\nHoly moly. Your parents are gthe reason you go to therapy. Of course you need to talk talk about the therapist about then. Dont let them discourage you, they just felt like they got caught stealing, and now they try to manipulate you. \n\nGetting imprisoned is btw. Not a punishment befitting a child. I wonder if that rabbit hole goes deeper. \n\nHowever, tell your therapist she needs to be more carefull in contacting your parents. They might undermine the process when they feel their ego is threatened.", "At least here where I live therapists are not allowed and will not tell your parents about things you have said to them without your explicit permission. Sure, if you were a danger to yourself or others, but even then it wouldn't be a call to your parents, and your post gave no indication of such condition. Keep in touch with the outside world. Your therapist, if you can still trust them, any friends or relatives. I don't want to scare you, but it's good that someone you know and can trust knows where and how you are, especially if your parents behave like this. You have every right to your feelings and your parents cannot deny your experiences from you. What you have been through is not \"normal\" in the sense that everyone would have experienced that. If your parents don't want you to tell / actively try to stop you from telling something about their parenting, you probably should say it out loud to a trustworthy adult. Do you have any relatives or family friends you could contact? Stay safe!", "NTA. If they don't want you telling people about the way they are parenting, maybe they should rethink the they parent you.", "NTA. your parents were embarrassed about their punishment for you.  \nNO it is not normal for any parent to lock their child in a room.\n\nYour therapist has not done the right thing. it is a safeguarding issue and the appropriate persons should have been contacted.", "NTA, a lot of us grow up thinking things at home are normal things that everyone does.\n\nThen you mention them to other people and see your parents squirm uncomfortably in the moment, and then you get yelled at and punished in private for discussing \"private family matters.\"\n\nMy daughter is in therapy for ADHD. Does she ever talk about me? Probably. I think everyone talks about their parents in therapy at some point. I also think any therapist would want to establish if a minor is in a healthy home environment. Am I a perfect parent? Of course not. But I try my best, and I'm not worried about what my daughter is telling her.\n\nDo what you can to survive until you're old enough to get out and be independent.", "Go talk to teacher when you get to school.

What your parents did is abuse and that is why they are rightly concerned about someone else finding out.  They are damn lucky the therapist did not call CPS.  But maybe you should consider it.

They should have gotten in trouble for locking you alone in a room with no adult. What if there was a fire or another disaster, you would have died?\n\nYour therapist needs to be told that there was retribution as a result of her call and you won't be allowed to see her again if it happens again given your parents reactions. Maybe you can reach some understanding about when she can reach out and that she will tell you in advance so you can be prepared for the possible fallout.", "NTA but keep speaking the truth.

GL, I hope you are well", "I'm so sorry that's happening to you.  If you can, tell a teacher and counselor at school.  Your parent's doing that is 100% not okay.\n\nOn another note, I can sympathize with getting in trouble for what was said in therapy.  My mum used to try to ground me for what she assumed I was telling my therapist, but at least my dad would counter her punishments.  Her emotional and psychological manipulation and abuse was less easy to deal with as she was great sometimes, and others...well, after she died I spent a lot of time in therapy and was honest for the first time.  I was in my 30's by then and still know I have some issues.
