As someone suggested I would recommend telling your therapist your parents grounded you with no end in sight, how your dad talks to you etc. Nothing about how your parents are treating you is okay.

I beg you not to turn against your therapist because they told your parents what you\u2019ve said. Yes it sucks that you\u2019re now in trouble at home because of it, but all you did was tell the truth. And if things get bad at home, your therapist may be the only person who can and will help you. Good luck OP, and I\u2019m sorry your parents are treating you like this, you deserve better.", "NTA.\n\nHoly moly. Your parents are gthe reason you go to therapy. Of course you need to talk talk about the therapist about then. Dont let them discourage you, they just felt like they got caught stealing, and now they try to manipulate you. \n\nGetting imprisoned is btw. Not a punishment befitting a child. I wonder if that rabbit hole goes deeper. \n\nHowever, tell your therapist she needs to be more carefull in contacting your parents. They might undermine the process when they feel their ego is threatened.", "At least here where I live therapists are not allowed and will not tell your parents about things you have said to them without your explicit permission.

Your therapist, if you can still trust them, any friends or relatives. I don't want to scare you, but it's good that someone you know and can trust knows where and how you are, especially if your parents behave like this. You have every right to your feelings and your parents cannot deny your experiences from you. What you have been through is not \"normal\" in the sense that everyone would have experienced that. If your parents don't want you to tell / actively try to stop you from telling something about their parenting, you probably should say it out loud to a trustworthy adult.

My mum used to try to ground me for what she assumed I was telling my therapist, but at least my dad would counter her punishments.  Her emotional and psychological manipulation and abuse was less easy to deal with as she was great sometimes, and others...well, after she died I spent a lot of time in therapy and was honest for the first time.
