I'm sorry you're in this situation but if his name is on your title, tread extremely carefully. You've now entered the territory where there could be legal issues.

He is contributing nothing to your relationship and is putting you in a financial burden. If you stay with him, the rest of your life will likely be a miserable struggle. You are young - don\u2019t allow him to become a permanent burden/fixture in your life. Kick him out of your apartment - you won\u2019t save money on rent, but utilities, food, etc. costs will all go down and that can help you save up for a new car. You\u2019ve allowed him to behave this way for too long - he is not going to change his actions since you have shown him that you will support his ass.

I was a single parent with 3 kids and I paid for EVERYTHING. They paid for some nights out when we went to dinner. I mentioned one time how they didn't pay rent and their exact response was \"But I pay for dinner. That should be enough.\" So yea, they were quickly kicked to the curb but it took me 2 years to realize this asshole was playing me and mooching off me. Don't be me. Kick this guy out. You are not his mom, you are not responsible for taking care of him.

Go find someone better, this guy stinks and is worth less than you're totaled car.", "Wait - so the car is in his name? And it got totalled?\n\nIf this happens to be in the USA, he probably has an insurance check coming.
