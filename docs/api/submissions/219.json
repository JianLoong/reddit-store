I asked her before bridesmaid dress shopping if we needed to consider them being covered due to some members of the Groom\u2019s family being fairly conservative people. Tina said that it wasn\u2019t an issue and we decided on a dress that covered my upper arms but had my chest and lower arm tattoos visible.\n\nCut to the morning of the wedding and as we are getting ready, a lady with a makeup kit walked in. We hadn\u2019t booked an MUA but it turns out that Tina\u2019s MIL had - specifically one that catered to body makeup. She had booked an MUA to cover my tattoos.\n\nA few weeks before the wedding, Tina showed her a photo of me in the bridesmaid dress and she booked the MUA later that evening. Her reasoning was that I would ruin the photos and also upset the Groom\u2019s Grandmother. \n\nI declined the offer and Tina stood by my decision\n\nTina was upset and was apologising to the MUA for wasting her time whilst her mother-in-law tore me to shreds about being disrespectful to her wishes. She left and we decided to move on and try and enjoy the rest of the morning before the wedding.\n\nAn hour later, the groom showed up at the hotel room. He screamed at me for not caring enough about his Mom and called me an asshole for letting his Mom waste $400 on the MUA. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1667168103, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhrooo/aita_for_refusing_to_cover_my_tattoos_at_a_wedding/", "score": 688, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can hear when the baby two or three houses down starts to have a meltdown. It's a little unusual that a grown adult actually screaming wouldn't be heard by someone in the next room. Yelling/shouting I can usually hear too but not always. Someone just raising their voice and being more empathetic when speaking I can't hear.\n\nAnd yeah raising your voice at someone or yelling isn't the best way to handle a situation but doesn't automatically mean you're an asshole."]}
