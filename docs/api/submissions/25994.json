{"id": 25994, "submission_id": "16729u3", "title": "AITA for possibly ruining my brother\u2019s future?", "selftext": "I (f17) have an older brother Jack (m20). We never really got along. We simply both have different interests and different opinions about the world.\n\nJack found his first girlfriend Samantha. He never had one before because of his autism (he is high functioning, but has trouble socializing with others). Our parents were happy for him and so was I.\n\nFew days ago I was watching a movie late in the night. Our parents were asleep. My brother bursted through the front door which is located around a cornered from where I was. I caught a glimpse of him. He was vissibly drunk (legal drinking age in our country is 18). He didn\u2019t notice me and continued to his room. When he was leaving his phone fell out of his pocket. I was curious so I took it. I knew his password and got in.\n\nI wanted to know more about Sam so I looked through his texts with her. I found out Sam was 15 and overall the messages were disturbing. He would tell her he would break up with her If she wouldn\u2019t send him nud\u20acs. And If she wanted to break up he would manipulate or straight up bu11y her to stay. I also learned that he would get her drunk and then had s\u20acx with her. She called him out on that but he argued that she liked it. I took pictures of the screen on my phone.\n\nI was horrified. Mostly because I once was in a situation like she is in and Jack knows very well about it. For context when I was 14 I came out as a lesbian. One girl messaged me on Instagram and asked me to be her girlfriend. She was 18 but I was so glad somebody wanted to be with me so I agreed. She would force me into s\u20acx, make me start i11egal substances and more messed up sh!t I will make a seperate post about but you get the idea. I had to go to rehab (for an addiction) and I am still going to therapy sessions. \n\nI had to put a stop to whatever was going on. I firstly messaged Sam (I took a picture of her contact) and confirmed everything. I promised her that I will get her away from Jack.\n\nI wanted to contact authorities to get Sam away from him but I found her parents on Facebook and messaged them about the relationship (we spoke about telling it to her parents with Sam but she didn\u2019t want to do it alone because she kept it a secret). I told her parents that If they want to take it to the police I would send them proof.\n\nYesterday I got a message from Sam\u2019s parents asking for the evidence. I gave it to them. Now Jack will face legal actions against him which will leave a catastrophic impact on his future. Also they don\u2019t want me to get in trouble and will tell the police a different story about how they found out. I know I did the right thing but a part of me thinks I should\u2019ve stand with my brother and keep quiet.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693560284, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16729u3/aita_for_possibly_ruining_my_brothers_future/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This has nothing to do with autism.\n\nI think this needs to be stressed, so here you go:\n\n#**Being a sexual predator has nothing to do with autism.**\n\nDo not allow anyone to use that excuse, because someone down the line probably will. But blackmailing people into sex and sexual acts and targeting 15-year-old girls AS A 20-YEAR-OLD has absolutely zero to do with \"not interpreting social cues well\".", "\ud83d\ude44", "but she didn't ask if she was an a-hole for disrespecting his privacy. She asked if she was an a-hole for doing what she did once she had fucked up. Like... if I broke into a house to rob it, but found a guy trying to kill another person, am I the a-hole for calling the police even though I had no business being in that house to begin with?\n\nBecause that is basically what OP is doing. She's preventing her brother to further abuse a (potentially depending on country) minor mentally and physically. What he's doing is criminal, not even minor crime, it's a serious crime that could put him away for a looooong time. And let's say he breaks up with Sam and she gets away from him. He is just gonna find another victim (which he probably refers to as a girlfriend).", "Personally feel like sexual predators don't really deserve a right to privacy", "It doesn't justify it but I think the major issue in this case is not the privacy violation.", "I don't disagree that they don't deserve it but everyone needs to be afforded the same basic human rights afforded to them by the constitution. You can't just give licence to the scrutiny of people's private information on the off chance that you may find something incriminating. Certain protocols must be maintained.", "Sure, but I feel like the ruling of Y T A (implying, based on subreddit protocol, that OP is the asshole and no other parties are) is *seriously* picking the wrong hill to stand on. One person snooped, the other is a sex offender. The math ain't mathing", "It's not a case of there being one possible asshole. There can be two potential assholes of varying degrees. Maybe I should have gone for ESH. Fair enough if OP had a particular suspicion and was seeking to investigate, but they started searching through the phone without any clue what they were looking for. It would be just like a cop searching through your shit for no reason, just hoping they could find something to bust you for.", "Yeah you're definitely looking for an E S H ruling then, leaning heavily one way. People tend to get VERY touchy with sexual crimes, and for good reason - don't ever expect to be very popular when you're the guy in the room persecuting a crime that uncovered a MUCH bigger, worse crime", "I get what you are saying and I hope he gets what he deserves. OP was lucky. They weren't suspicious, by their own account they were just curious. Curiosity does not give you the right to hack into someone's phone. But yeah, the sexual predator shit is far worse."]}
