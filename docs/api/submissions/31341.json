How does it improve a relationship? Fighting over the blanket? Having different body temperatures or circadian rhythms. And the snoring, sleep talking, and restless legs? No, thank you. \n\nIt's wild to me. Like, I have no idea where my partner is when I'm asleep.

You dont try to wake him up, you dont force some kind of solutions on him. His snoring is so bad you prefer to sleep on a bad couch! And yet this person cant understand you? He is a huge asshole! Any normal person would feel kinda of guilty because of this. But he wants you to be there to listen to him snoring all night long! Seems like he doesnt really cares for you.\n\nAgain: He is an asshole. Buy some kind of mastress or similar for the other bedroom. Your sleep is important too.

He's disappointed that we can't cuddle in bed, but he understands. I do use earplugs if I'm sleeping in the bed with him, provided that I don't have to get up for work or something. One earplug usually falls out for some reason I'm not sure of, but if it doesn't, I sleep really well because of the earplugs despite his earth-shattering snoring.", "It\u2019s hard for me to answer this because snoring doesn\u2019t bother me. I grew up with dogs, including english bulldogs, and my father is an extreme snorer, he can be heard through the entire house. My boyfriend also snores, but i find it easier to sleep when he does because im so used to it. And he sleeps easier when we are in the same bed. \n\nMy father\u2019s wife of many, many years sleeps in the same bed with him and with foam earplugs. You said you weren\u2019t willing to do so because its uncomfortable, have you tried it or is that just an assumption? \n\nPart of me wants to say you should be more willing to adapt because you said he works much more than you do, but maybe Im just old school. I cant blame you for not going to a doctor because i am the last one to ever go myself and healthcare is an extreme expense.
