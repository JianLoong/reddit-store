I'm living away from home at the moment at university, and my sister recently got accepted onto her dream course at the same university as me. Currently she lives on campus in a house designed for first years, while I'm in a small flatshare. \n\nAbby seems to be loving the independent life and I'm happy to see her going to bars with friends and enjoying life as an adult so much. But recently a guy \"John\" came into her life, and she initially promised me not to tell our parents she had a bf already. Not knowing much and assuming he was a normal teenager I promised. However a couple of nights ago she came over and told me all about him.\n\nJohn isn't a member of the uni - she and her friends met him in a nearby bar one night and they kept in touch. John is 28, which she hadnt mentioned when she had first told me about meeting him, which makes me incredibly uneasy. Apparently he's a heavy drinker and he smokes, all of which Abby is certainly not experienced in.\n\nI wanted to meet him, because I was really worried about the age gap and what he could want with such an inexperienced person, not that I couldn't guess. She said John didn't want to meet me or indeed our mum and dad, because he's \"nervous\". I saw a photo of him and he looks so much older than 28, which makes me wonder if that's actually a possibility. But I have no proof of that. \n\nBasically I really started regretting my promise, but then this was before all the information came out about him.\n\nIve started noticing she doesn't want to hang out with me anymore because she \"prefers to be with John\" and \"we had our whole childhoods to hang out and now it was time to meet new people\". Those sounded super manipulative and fed to her by him, and it set off all sorts of red flags in my brain.\n\nThat was the final, final straw for me. As soon as she'd left I rang my mum and told her about John. She was horrified and actually came up to our university the next day, where a huge fight took place. John was in her dorm with her and apparently took off in a hurry.\n\nOur parents are talking to the uni and my dad (who only wishes he couldve been there when John was) is thinking of involving law enforcement.\n\nMeanwhile, Abby blames me for betraying her trust, and she says I ruined everything.

You gave her enough trust, but involved your parents once it started to look like she was in danger.  What kind of grown adult hangs out in an 18 year old's dorm?  A total loser, that who.  He is dangerous to your sister.", "NTA  Better her anger than her being abused. She can't see the problems for the trees and until she grows up a little she probably won't. Good on you for being a proper protective sister!", "She may resent you for a while, but when she gets to Johns age she\u2019ll see how incredibly predatory his behavior was.

Especially since I'm sure John was trying to turn her against you already. \n\nYou were right not to turn a blind eye to this behavior. In the future, to preserve your relationship with your sister, a better approach might have been to tell her that you're concerned about John and why, and that if she doesn't tell your parents, you will. That basically gets the same thing done, but allows her to feel slightly more trust in you that she'll know before you share her secrets, and that you're giving her the dignity of deciding how to share it. \n\nIf you're comfortable with it, you could apologize to her for the way you did it. Not because I think you did anything wrong, but because I can imagine John will want to sneak into her life again, and it's important for her not to be isolated from her family when she doesn't come back. If she's not talking to you or her friends, then who will keep an eye on her relationship with John?", "Google John, please", "NTA\nHowever, I believe it's super important to look for professionals that know how to handle grooming victims. As of right now, their relationship has gone to the \"forbidden\" side, which might give him more power over her.\nShe doesn't have to agree with you or your parents, but please make sure that she doesn't see you as an enemy.\n\nAt universities there may be groups that talk about that. I believe that hearing from other people may have a greater effect on her.\n\nYou did the right thing.", "NTA.\nwhat 28 year old man wants to hang out with teenagers? A creepy one.", "NTA.

You are worried about your sister and with good reason, 10 year age gap with her being 18 is weird and creepy to me. You did what you thought was best to protect her and good. I hope you chase off evert weirdo until the right one comes along", "NTA - way to take care of your little sister!\n\nShe's gonna be angry with you for a bit...that will suck, but she'll get over it eventually.  You keep doing you.", "NTA John sounds like a walking red flag", "The fact that he left immediately after mom showed up is a red flag for me.  If his intentions were of a normal healthy dating relationship then he would have attempted to reassure mom.\n\nHe refused to meet with her sister who is at the same school and readily available.  \n\n18 year old is hiding her much older boyfriend from her friends and family.  If this was a healthy relationship then she would be excited to build relationships with her amazing boyfriend and her loved ones. \n\nThis probably could have been handled better by everyone but there are too many red flags to let this continue without some transparency from sister and boyfriend.  \n\nNTA as everyone in this story could have behaved better.", "NTA.

Abby felt grown up because she's got her first taste of adulthood, and then had John to pour poison in her ear.\n\nPeople like John identify their victim, build a rapport, often with rapid decisions to help create an Us vs Them mentality, then attempts to isolate them begin, through this they begin to exert more and more control over their victim.

And her desire to shift her social focus away from you is normal for her age.  You didn't have a local older sibling breathing down your neck when you started college.\n\nYou acted on fears, and assumptions about his age based on looks.  Not known and verified facts.  And who knows what further conclusions your parents jumped to, given your shaky facts.\n\nWhy are the police getting involved?  Your sister is 18, as long as he's not giving her alcohol, he's not breaking the law.

So on that, you're an AH.\n\nThat said, yeah, alarms all over the place!  I'd have demanded to meet him or else tell your parents, and probably even then.  You did what you thought was right with her best interest at heart, you didn't harm her, and technically she could keep seeing him if she wants (she's and adult, your parents can force her not to).  This will still have repercussions on your relationship with her for some time, even if it was the right thing to do.  No good deed goes unpunished seems to apply here.", "YTA you broke a promise.  I don\u2019t really think your controlling behavior toward an another adult is the issue.  Perhaps if you see the boyfriend as a threat then you should go talk to him!  You broke a promise though and that\u2019s unforgivable.", "NTA for sure. In the short term, she's going to see you that way and it's sort of understandable even though you aren't. Let her say her peace and don't hold it against her. As you said, she's young and inexperienced. Don't give up on her even if she says hurtful things. In the long run, she will be truly grateful for you but will need time for her to realize it. \n\nIf you cut off from her or yell at her, you both will regret it one day.

What OP did was 100% correct. That guy is a walking red flag. In fact it doesn't matter if OP's sister is 18 or 28. If she sees that her sister is in some kind of relationship that seems bad OP is gonna step in.
