You\u2019re wife is already doing 24/7 taking care of a newborn.", "YTA. I'm just going to point out that kids get sick all. the. time. So now that you have a kid in the house, it's time you start putting together a first aid box. It would be sensible to have a few common medicines in there too. \n\nYou don't have to go out and buy everything right now because it'll probably expire before your kid needs it, but unless you're really struggling, a bottle of cough syrup isn't going to bankrupt you if it sits in the box unused and ends up expiring. Better to have it and not need it, and all that. \n\nHaving stuff like that on hand would have avoided this whole mess. But since you didn't: your mother was out of line volunteering your wife to do an errand you're perfectly capable of doing yourself, and she has something more important to do anyway.

I think many of us are failing to consider the meaning of the word \"suggestion.\"", "Nope. MIL suggested wife go get OP, her son, meds... Choosing not to sleep in the same room is just that, a choice, and a kind one at that, that OP is making. Regardless of this choice, there's no indication that the wife must take the baby with her. \n\nI don't think NIL was right to suggest it, but she did and OP's wife can be angry or recognize it for what it was and move on. OP didn't order his wife to go get the meds. He simply acknowledged it and moved on....", "They are more rational and logical! They won't be really seated by feelings or bodily issues! They're **tough**! \ud83d\ude44", "Right? Endlessly grateful to be born in the 80s and not the 30s. Marriages back then were straight up cage matches \ud83d\ude33", "I think people are tryint to suggest it\u2019s exhausting - which would normally mean you\u2019d definitely be able to sleep when they sleep.", "Yup.", "You'd be wrong.", "You're not.  Go be a CNA or DSP.  Work in an Alzheimer's home providing daily living support.  Sign up to provide care at an adult residence for individuals with intellectual disability and autism.\n\nJobs are grueling in different ways.", "How is women's fault that some dude decides to apply for the grueling, shitty job while she doesn't?", "Where does it say that? You\u2019re literally making things up. It just says that after the call ended the wife was mad.", "Pure stupidity \ud83d\ude02", "I did.", "Exactly", "Or maybe it isn't worth arguing about it with his mom", "This is the title he used, bolding my me:\n\n>AITA for **thinking my wife has no right to feel concerned** about my mom's suggestion?\n\nIt's one thing to think it's an over reaction, but to think she has no right to to feel concerned is problematic, IMO", "Everyone stay hydrated!  I don't care how many legs you have!  Get into it!  Mlem mlem mlem!", "Well, that's not OP's wife's problem. It's up to OP to set boundaries with his mother. He is being a baby because he has a \"man cold.\"", "I have a hard time believing you have a baby or a partner.", "So you had to ask your partner how she took care of the kid?\n\nWay to out yourself as an absent parent my dude.", "No exhausting doesn't mean yiu can sleep when they do.\n\nYiu still have cleaning , washing , food prep etc to do.\n\nI did it fir 2 years, and it's crippling", "Oh, my. An insecure man said I\u2019m WRONG! How will I ever sleep tonight knowing that you, in all your masculine greatness, don\u2019t approve of me.", "Look at all the most dangerous and filthy jobs on the planet, and you will overwhelmingly find men doing them.", "For everyone saying I do not want to get out of home: I am, I was going to my workplace everyday and I would have gone to the drugstore if I needed something. I just don't understand why my wife is angry with my mom's suggestion and says that she is always overprotective with me. For example last week my wife went with the baby to her mom's place to celebrate her little brother's birthday and while I was home alone my mom came to help me and cooked the meals for me. My wife says she's always helping me and treating me like a child but when she went there there was also help for her...\n\n\nThis is his comment. In it, he states he has gone to work and would have gone to the drugstore if he needed anything. So he could\u2019ve picked up medicine on his way to or from work but he hasn\u2019t. He knows he needs medicine but only now that his mom suggested his wife get it for him, he agrees.", "How so? You\u2019re kind of just being a sad, whining little man right now.", "The one where she says as soon as a woman marries a man she becomes a mother? Implying men are incompetent children?", "The title oddly doesn\u2019t really fit the situation he describes in the post. The wife isn\u2019t \u201cconcerned\u201d.", "I have a harder time giving a fuck what you think, internet stranger.", "No, but good skills at jumping the gun! Its very easy to ask your partner \u201cwould you say the new baby part was easier than where we are now?\u201d and get an answer. \n\nYou people love a little mental gymnastics. \ud83d\ude0a", "\ud83d\ude02 toddler stage is much harder.", "You just make up some easily disproven shit about endurance and then make this silly, dramatic comment.\n\nYou know what moving weight for long periods looks like as a job?  Blue collar construction and repair.  Guess who does those jobs almost entirely?\n\nLmao", "Childbirth.  Check out the mortality rate on that one.\n\nThe jobs you are thinking of likely require feats physical strength that many women wouldn't be able to do.  But women do get stuck with a lot of gross tasks.", "In that comment he literally says he\u2019s willing and has in fact been going to work. He just doesn\u2019t get why his wife is mad at the SUGGESTION. He never in any way asked or told his wife to go.", "And he also doesn\u2019t even say he needs medicine. Just that he was sick. So it\u2019s all really hypothetical anyways.", "Of course she shouldn\u2019t have to, but if you want to change how men are viewed once a baby is born, maybe your attention shouldn\u2019t be on making women look worse.it makes it seem like maybe you personally have different priorities.", "Aw, can't use your words, except to curse? Nice!", "Maybe for you since now you have to pitch in!\n\nBut definitely not for a breastfeeding mother who has regained bodily autonomy and the ability to sleep more than a couple of hours in a row.", "You know what blue collar workers use to move weight around? Machines.", "Because why is his mother suggesting his wife go get medicine for him when she could just tell her son to get medicine? His mother and wife shouldn\u2019t have to do the thinking for him. His wife is busy with their child", "No, sorry, are you unable to read or do you just need some crayons to go along with it? I asked my partner (a human female, it that wasn\u2019t obvious) who reckons that toddler stage is significantly more tiring. \nEvery new parent thinks it\u2019s hard, and I wouldn\u2019t say it was easy, but it\u2019s the easiest part so far. You just, sleep when they sleep.", "Lmao guess how I know you've never done any blue collar work\n\nWhich machine swings the hammer, lifts the tires for rotation, and carries the shingles up the ladder?", "He can\u2019t prehear his mother\u2019s thoughts and change them. What is he supposed to do here? He\u2019s willing to get the meds if he even needed them. He didn\u2019t ask his wife to go. He has done nothing wrong."]}
