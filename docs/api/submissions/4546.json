Since you are neither qualified nor comfortable with performing such a task, you made the right choice.", "NTA.

Don't I find out the day before that her kid is diabetic. Hard nope. She goes over how he can do everything himself (he was 7 or 8 at the time) and I basically won't have to touch a thing. I said \"what if something goes wrong?\" \"It won't.\" \"But what if it does?\" \"You worry too much.\"  \nSorry lady. This is WAY above my paygrade. I walked right out of there and told her no, I don't feel comfortable with that amount of pressure, she called me names and spit at me and screamed so I ran home as fast as I could. I'll tell you what my mom told me:  \n\n\nYou are NOT obligated to care for a child with health concerns that could lead to severe situations. You have the right to say no. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. I\u2019m a nurse and wouldn\u2019t be comfortable caring for a 5 year old diabetic over night that I don\u2019t know.", "NTA.. insulin injects, blood sugars and all diabetic care can be super confusing and overwhelming when you have no experience.. the mom should not have ever put you in that position.", "NTA.\n\nShe blindsided you and was hoping for the best.  Even if the kid just needed to take a pill at bedtime, that sort of thing should have been disclosed when you took the gig.", "NTA. It\u2019s pretty obvious the mom tried to ambush you, and was hoping she could run out of there before you could refuse. Good job standing up for yourself, OP! At 18 years old this is an incredibly useful and important skill to have.", "NTA easy would have been \"mu kid is allergic to peanuts there is no peanuts in the house if you vae some please let them in your car\" not \"here is a list of things to do and if you fail to do them on time my chilmd could die\".", "NTA\n\nSpecial medical needs are something you absolutely deserve to know in advance before agreeing to look after children, and surprising you with that at the last minute is unacceptable.", "NTA.  It\u2019s easy for her because she\u2019s likely used to the routine.  That doesn\u2019t make it a good idea to dump her diabetic child off on a babysitter with no knowledge of diabetes management.", "NTA.

That's important info to just spring on a babysitter.  You did not feel up to it, refusing is well within your rights", "NTA\n\nI am a retired Medical Technologist now called Medical Laboratory Scientist, and sticking needles into small children does not always go well.  I cannot believe the mother wanted to dump her child's care on an inexperienced teenager.  You did the right thing.", "NTA. You did the right thing. This is medical neglect.", "NTA. Any specialized needs for babysitting should be disclosed beforehand. She did not do that.", "NTA - She absolutely should have had you do a trial run before have you babysit for nearly 24 hours with her being hours away. It was irresponsible her to assume that you are willing, never mind responsible enough, to manage her son's diabetes for him. It would be a bit different if he was older, but at 5 he still needs significant supervision.", "NTA! Both my kids have nut allergies and one has asthma, I always stated that up front before arranging care. Springing diabetes and injections on you if insane and mom probably knows it.", "NTA looking after a child with diabetes can be challenging. I\u2019m a teacher and if we get a diabetic child in our class the staff receive special training. \nEven if the child were older and would be able to take point on monitoring would be challenging but a 5 year old needs someone who knows what they are doing, overnight care shouldn\u2019t be left to someone with no experience at all.", "How in the world did the mother think it was a good idea to get a babysitter with no diabetic experience? Sure, it\u2019s easy for her because she knows how to do it, but you cant say the same about others. \n\nNTA", "NTA at all this is above and beyond the realms of standard babysitting and she really should have been upfront about it.\n\nNot to doubt you OP but objectively speaking she was putting her child at risk leaving her with a stranger who had told her they didn't have experience administering that kind of medication.\n\nAllergies are one thing, or a tablet with dinner may be reasonable but this was a lot to expect without warning.", "NTA. NTA in the slightest. You did the right and responsible thing. To look after a child with type 1 diabetes, you need to know what it is, how it happens, what insulin is and how it works, symptoms of DKA and hypoglycaemic episodes, how to carb count, how to give corrections, emergency protocols, when to go to the hospital and when something can be safely treated at home\u2026 I\u2019m a paediatrician from the UK and it\u2019s normal for children and their families to stay in hospital for a few days after their first episode so the specialist nurses can teach them all of the above. If I\u2019m managing them, I\u2019ll reach for the protocol to make sure I\u2019ve not missed anything. \n\nDo not, under any circumstances, agree to babysit this kid if you don\u2019t feel comfortable.", "NTA- also the fact that the kid is 5\u2026 the chances of that kid still being at the phase where they kick and scream is high either resulting in your injury or you fucking up the injection.", "NTA. That's a completely acceptable boundary to have.\n\n I would *also* recommend contacting the family who recommended her to you. Don't blame them for it, just explain the situation that you weren't comfortable with what needed to happen, and say you wanted to give them a heads up in case *she* complains about you to them.", "NTA and honestly the mother should be grateful to you for being upfront and honest about your limitations.", "NTA. Don't expect to hear from here again, but yeah she absolutely should have told you beforehand. Injections are not a normal, expected part of babysitting and usually that \"come over early to go over stuff\" is just about bedtime and where the snacks are, not *medical processes*. Insulin is no big deal when you do it everyday, but it's wild to just assume a teenage babysitter you never met would be fine with it without any prior discussion.", "NTA She didn't tell you deliberately and it's irresponsible on her part not to disclose this information so you could make an informed decision. Leaving a diabetic child with someone who has no experience caring for a diabetic and what to do if the child's blood sugar drops or spikes is the height of irresponsibility.", "Medical needs need to be communicated over the phone before the day of babysitting. NTA", "NTA \n\nThat is something that should have been made aware of prior. You can\u2019t teach someone to do that stuff in 5 minutes and expect child to remain safe and healthy.", "NTA\n\nIt was unreasonable of her to just drop that on you.", "Good grief, you're NTA! It wouldn't even be safe for you to care for a diabetic child when you don't know how and the child really isn't old enough to understand her own medical needs. \n\nI don't know what this mom was thinking! I'm sure she's stressed and tired and needs a break but her child's safety needs to come first.", "NTA. If she has a child with special needs, it's on her to find a babysitter comfortable with these special needs, not spring it at the very last minute.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't feel comfortable doing important medical things that you were completely unprepared for. She's a bit of an AH for blind siding you.", "NTA-A serious medical condition is something the parent should have absolutely been up front about before you agreed to take the job.", "NTA - I (30M) would feel comfortable watching a diabetic baby (5yo is baby), and 18yo me might have been up to the task, but I have been around diabetes my whole life, so it's different.", "NTA\n\nShe wasn't up front with you about the medical condition and continually tried to downplay your concerns.  Only do what you're comfortable doing, especially for an over-night job.", "NTA. My kid is diabetic, it's not as easy to manage as she tried to make it out to be. Too many things could have gone wrong, and I'm sure she'd probably try to blame you if anything happened.", "NTA, diabetes varies based on each person, some have it a lot worse than others, which adds a whole other list of variables. Insulin type, knowledge of safe blood sugar levels, the person's normal blood sugar, amount of insulin to inject if needed and how to determine that, and how much sugar to give them in the event their blood sugar plummets. My dad and most of his family has diabetes, and I work with a lot of people that have it. One of my coworkers has an insulin pump, which that really makes it more complex to deal with cause then you have to keep the blood sugar up to keep up with the pump. Its way too easy to fuck up diabetic care so I dont blame you one bit.", "Yup! NTA, with anything that serious. She should have told you before hand. People struggle with epi pens, let alone insulin injections.", "NTA. You were bring responsible and mature.", "**NTA** \n\n**YOU DID THE RIGHT THING OP!!!** My cousin was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 4 and it was a few years of intense medical training and practice before we were allowed to babysit her and she is *family.* Kids that young cannot recognize or notify you of the symptoms of different problems with their sugars, not to mention struggle with needles and you have no experience calculating or administering proper doses of insulin. \n\nThe child could have slipped into a coma, gone blind, or even died thanks to this mom's recklessness. I understand parents need a break, lord knows my aunt deserved one, but a normal babysitter is not equipped to properly care for a diabetic. There are a million babysitting services that have certified carers and it is completely inappropriate of her to expect you to go in blind. \n\nAll that to say OP, this is not your responsibility and not your fault.", "NTA. Requiring you to test blood sugar and give injections is way outside the normal babysitting expectations, and should have been disclosed beforehand. You wouldn't have walk out \"last minute\" if she had been honest up front; you could have declined when she said it had medical requirements outside your expertise.", "NTA Having to give injections should have been discussed beforehand. Even a quick, \"Oh and are you comfortable giving insulin injections?\" when they were asking you to babysit would have been enough. Its unfortunate that she may have missed her night out, but this happens to parents all the time lol, its not your fault she didn't ensure you were prepared BEFORE the night of.", " NTA for setting clear boundaries. It's important that you don't step into anything you're uncomfortable with, especially when you're babysitting! However, did you as her if she had any special needs/requests beforehand? She 100% should've told you, but I do feel that you also had a little responsibility to ask before signing up for it.", "I'm sure the mother was bummed you didn't feel comfortable giving an injection, etc. But she should have mentioned it prior to being halfway out the door! It's a big deal, and her kid's health depends on someone doing it properly. I like your suggestion to her, to work up to a longer stay w/ her 5yo. Assuming she isn't blaming you, NAH.", "NAH. She should have disclosed this and given you basic training beforehand. I understand how since she is so used to this she wouldn't even think about it. You said you were uncomfortable, but followed that with a willingness to learn.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I always suggest asking if kids have allergies and if so what precautions should I take prior to my arrival, do they take medications, require certain diets, require transportation, have specific routines that need to be stuck to, and are car seats available in the event of an emergency or do I call 911. My won\u2019t do list is non negotiable and I make sure they understand that (for example I won\u2019t drive kids unless it\u2019s an emergency because I don\u2019t trust other drivers in the large city we live in, I don\u2019t do sick kids because I\u2019m a sympathetic barfer, and there are certain medically based things I won\u2019t do). These kinds of things minimize surprises on the job and help set boundaries for everyone. Additionally, I would look into nannying services in your area. Working for a service means families have to be vetted before taken on as a client, you can still do at will jobs, and they can help negotiate things you aren\u2019t comfortable with doing yourself or need back up on, assure you\u2019re being paid and treated fairly, and in some cases provide you with legal coverage in the event you\u2019re accused of something untoward.", "You acted properly.", "NTA.

When my youngest was diagnosed at 14, we all went to classes with his endocrinologist. I learned that nursing school in the 1990s spent very little time on T1D, but focused several lectures on T2D. Also there have been huge strides in understanding and treating T1D in the previous 20 years. \n\nYou are definitely NTA for refusing this assignment with only 5 min of training, the mom should have told you immediately when booking you that her child was diabetic, and were you comfortable with that. If they are still on fingerstick/injection, they are probably also fairly early into his diagnosis. When she calms down from her disappointment, perhaps she will be open to spending a Saturday( with pay) to teach you about caring for her child. \n\n As she progresses through, her child will eventually -soon probably, be put on a continuous glucose monitor/insulin pump. Having a device that alerts you to him having a low blood sugar would be the only way you should babysit overnight. High blood sugar does damage slowly over time ( and the CGM lets you know those too), Low blood sugars can cause seizures and death. The risk of that is very small. The FDA just approved a loop system that has the CGM and insulin pump communicate.

Poor kid could end up dead from an untrained caregiver.", "Yep, like, giving 1 extra unit of insulin in 5 year old, can literally kill them.... there's  no way in hell I would be okay with leaving my T1D kid with someone who had no idea what they were doing", "Absolutely this...and for an overnight, I'm wondering if she has any family/ex spouse, etc to help watch the child instead?\n\nI get it being new to an area, but if you have friends you are comfortable enough going to an overnight trip, then that means you have a circle of friends nearby that can babysit.\n\nIt seems extremely carless and irresponsible how she handled this!\n\nAnd yes, if you have a child with medical needs, you hire qualified sitters that know what they are doing!!", "Hahaha omg the totally unrelated to diabetes pain messing with your sugar is TOO REAL. Like when the weather changes and my insulin needs immediate adjusting. \n\nSolidarity with you, fellow T1D \ud83d\ude05", "Oh s* this one can honestly win everything.", "For T2?  Two days learning injections?  \n\nI get it that type 1 is different, especially when a child is involved.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed, I started on pills and they teach you how to test, but once on injections, it was a simple Dr visit to show you how to do it, and do a practice test once/twice.\n\nIt does not take 2 days of training for a T2 diabetic to learn how to inject.\n\nIt also took me one vet visit to learn how to test/inject my cat.\n\nThat said, NTA for the OP here at all.  She should have been made aware at first contact and had plenty of time to discuss/educated herself then a 5 min brush down before heaving for an overnight trip, leaving your 5 year old T1 diabetic with a virtual stranger!\n\nThe mom is  TA here.", "I\u2019m a pet sitter/house sitter who previously owned and gave injections to a diabetic cat, and helped diagnose a long-term client with diabetes by discussing my concerns about symptoms with the owner which confirmed her own suspicions and sent her to the vet, and I STILL went to her vet for classes before the next time I sat for them!  And that\u2019s a cat!", "My cousin has a diabetic toddler and this whole scenario just blows my mind.", "u/Sukdx is a bot.", "You know adults do develop type 1 diabetes, and mocking someone that takes two days to learn is not nice either."]}
