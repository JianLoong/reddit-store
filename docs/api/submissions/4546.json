I also told her that I am squeamish around needles, and she kind of laughed it off and continued trying to teach me. I finally had to cut her off and basically told her that unfortunately I wasn\u2019t comfortable caring for her diabetic child on such short notice, especially since she will be hours away (and probably drunk lets be honest). She started freaking out and begging me to stay, as she didn\u2019t want to miss her trip. It seemed like she was about to cry as I was leaving, which made me feel bad. I texted her when I got home and basically said that in the future I would be willing to try, but I\u2019d like to have some kind of \u201ctrial run\u201d and we could build up to overnight once I actually knew what I was doing.

That mom should know better, good for you for walking away from that risky situation.", "NTA. Since you are neither qualified nor comfortable with performing such a task, you made the right choice.", "NTA. I had that same experience when I was 16.  \nA friend of a woman I sat for wanted to hire me for a few nights, and I was totally ok with it (what with her price range, 200 a night! ok!).\n\nWell. Don't I find out the day before that her kid is diabetic. Hard nope. She goes over how he can do everything himself (he was 7 or 8 at the time) and I basically won't have to touch a thing. I said \"what if something goes wrong?\" \"It won't.\" \"But what if it does?\" \"You worry too much.\"  \nSorry lady. This is WAY above my paygrade. I walked right out of there and told her no, I don't feel comfortable with that amount of pressure, she called me names and spit at me and screamed so I ran home as fast as I could. I'll tell you what my mom told me:  \n\n\nYou are NOT obligated to care for a child with health concerns that could lead to severe situations. You have the right to say no. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. I\u2019m a nurse and wouldn\u2019t be comfortable caring for a 5 year old diabetic over night that I don\u2019t know.", "NTA.. insulin injects, blood sugars and all diabetic care can be super confusing and overwhelming when you have no experience.. the mom should not have ever put you in that position.", "NTA.\n\nShe blindsided you and was hoping for the best.  Even if the kid just needed to take a pill at bedtime, that sort of thing should have been disclosed when you took the gig.", "NTA. It\u2019s pretty obvious the mom tried to ambush you, and was hoping she could run out of there before you could refuse. Good job standing up for yourself, OP! At 18 years old this is an incredibly useful and important skill to have.", "NTA easy would have been \"mu kid is allergic to peanuts there is no peanuts in the house if you vae some please let them in your car\" not \"here is a list of things to do and if you fail to do them on time my chilmd could die\".", "NTA\n\nSpecial medical needs are something you absolutely deserve to know in advance before agreeing to look after children, and surprising you with that at the last minute is unacceptable.", "NTA.  It\u2019s easy for her because she\u2019s likely used to the routine.  That doesn\u2019t make it a good idea to dump her diabetic child off on a babysitter with no knowledge of diabetes management.", "NTA. If you\u2019re not comfortable and have no prior knowledge, it\u2019s honestly in everyone\u2019s best interest that you aren\u2019t solely responsible for the diabetic 5 year old.", "NTA.  That's important info to just spring on a babysitter.  You did not feel up to it, refusing is well within your rights", "NTA\n\nI am a retired Medical Technologist now called Medical Laboratory Scientist, and sticking needles into small children does not always go well.  I cannot believe the mother wanted to dump her child's care on an inexperienced teenager.  You did the right thing.", "NTA. You did the right thing. This is medical neglect.", "NTA. Any specialized needs for babysitting should be disclosed beforehand. She did not do that.", "NTA - She absolutely should have had you do a trial run before have you babysit for nearly 24 hours with her being hours away. It was irresponsible her to assume that you are willing, never mind responsible enough, to manage her son's diabetes for him. It would be a bit different if he was older, but at 5 he still needs significant supervision.", "NTA! Both my kids have nut allergies and one has asthma, I always stated that up front before arranging care. Springing diabetes and injections on you if insane and mom probably knows it.", "NTA looking after a child with diabetes can be challenging. I\u2019m a teacher and if we get a diabetic child in our class the staff receive special training. \nEven if the child were older and would be able to take point on monitoring would be challenging but a 5 year old needs someone who knows what they are doing, overnight care shouldn\u2019t be left to someone with no experience at all.", "How in the world did the mother think it was a good idea to get a babysitter with no diabetic experience? Sure, it\u2019s easy for her because she knows how to do it, but you cant say the same about others. \n\nNTA", "NTA at all this is above and beyond the realms of standard babysitting and she really should have been upfront about it.\n\nNot to doubt you OP but objectively speaking she was putting her child at risk leaving her with a stranger who had told her they didn't have experience administering that kind of medication.\n\nAllergies are one thing, or a tablet with dinner may be reasonable but this was a lot to expect without warning.", "NTA. NTA in the slightest. You did the right and responsible thing. To look after a child with type 1 diabetes, you need to know what it is, how it happens, what insulin is and how it works, symptoms of DKA and hypoglycaemic episodes, how to carb count, how to give corrections, emergency protocols, when to go to the hospital and when something can be safely treated at home\u2026 I\u2019m a paediatrician from the UK and it\u2019s normal for children and their families to stay in hospital for a few days after their first episode so the specialist nurses can teach them all of the above. If I\u2019m managing them, I\u2019ll reach for the protocol to make sure I\u2019ve not missed anything. \n\nDo not, under any circumstances, agree to babysit this kid if you don\u2019t feel comfortable.", "NTA- also the fact that the kid is 5\u2026 the chances of that kid still being at the phase where they kick and scream is high either resulting in your injury or you fucking up the injection.", "NTA. That's a completely acceptable boundary to have.\n\n I would *also* recommend contacting the family who recommended her to you. Don't blame them for it, just explain the situation that you weren't comfortable with what needed to happen, and say you wanted to give them a heads up in case *she* complains about you to them.", "NTA and honestly the mother should be grateful to you for being upfront and honest about your limitations.", "NTA. Don't expect to hear from here again, but yeah she absolutely should have told you beforehand. Injections are not a normal, expected part of babysitting and usually that \"come over early to go over stuff\" is just about bedtime and where the snacks are, not *medical processes*. Insulin is no big deal when you do it everyday, but it's wild to just assume a teenage babysitter you never met would be fine with it without any prior discussion.", "NTA She didn't tell you deliberately and it's irresponsible on her part not to disclose this information so you could make an informed decision. Leaving a diabetic child with someone who has no experience caring for a diabetic and what to do if the child's blood sugar drops or spikes is the height of irresponsibility.", "Medical needs need to be communicated over the phone before the day of babysitting. NTA", "NTA \n\nThat is something that should have been made aware of prior. You can\u2019t teach someone to do that stuff in 5 minutes and expect child to remain safe and healthy.", "NTA\n\nIt was unreasonable of her to just drop that on you.", "Good grief, you're NTA! It wouldn't even be safe for you to care for a diabetic child when you don't know how and the child really isn't old enough to understand her own medical needs. \n\nI don't know what this mom was thinking! I'm sure she's stressed and tired and needs a break but her child's safety needs to come first.", "NTA. If she has a child with special needs, it's on her to find a babysitter comfortable with these special needs, not spring it at the very last minute.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't feel comfortable doing important medical things that you were completely unprepared for. She's a bit of an AH for blind siding you.", "NTA-A serious medical condition is something the parent should have absolutely been up front about before you agreed to take the job.", "NTA - I (30M) would feel comfortable watching a diabetic baby (5yo is baby), and 18yo me might have been up to the task, but I have been around diabetes my whole life, so it's different.", "NTA\n\nShe wasn't up front with you about the medical condition and continually tried to downplay your concerns.  Only do what you're comfortable doing, especially for an over-night job.", "NTA. My kid is diabetic, it's not as easy to manage as she tried to make it out to be. Too many things could have gone wrong, and I'm sure she'd probably try to blame you if anything happened.", "NTA, diabetes varies based on each person, some have it a lot worse than others, which adds a whole other list of variables. Insulin type, knowledge of safe blood sugar levels, the person's normal blood sugar, amount of insulin to inject if needed and how to determine that, and how much sugar to give them in the event their blood sugar plummets. My dad and most of his family has diabetes, and I work with a lot of people that have it. One of my coworkers has an insulin pump, which that really makes it more complex to deal with cause then you have to keep the blood sugar up to keep up with the pump. Its way too easy to fuck up diabetic care so I dont blame you one bit.", "Yup! NTA, with anything that serious. She should have told you before hand. People struggle with epi pens, let alone insulin injections.", "NTA. You were bring responsible and mature.", "**NTA** \n\n**YOU DID THE RIGHT THING OP!!!** My cousin was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 4 and it was a few years of intense medical training and practice before we were allowed to babysit her and she is *family.* Kids that young cannot recognize or notify you of the symptoms of different problems with their sugars, not to mention struggle with needles and you have no experience calculating or administering proper doses of insulin. \n\nThe child could have slipped into a coma, gone blind, or even died thanks to this mom's recklessness. I understand parents need a break, lord knows my aunt deserved one, but a normal babysitter is not equipped to properly care for a diabetic. There are a million babysitting services that have certified carers and it is completely inappropriate of her to expect you to go in blind. \n\nAll that to say OP, this is not your responsibility and not your fault.", "NTA. Requiring you to test blood sugar and give injections is way outside the normal babysitting expectations, and should have been disclosed beforehand. You wouldn't have walk out \"last minute\" if she had been honest up front; you could have declined when she said it had medical requirements outside your expertise.", "NTA Having to give injections should have been discussed beforehand. Even a quick, \"Oh and are you comfortable giving insulin injections?\" when they were asking you to babysit would have been enough. Its unfortunate that she may have missed her night out, but this happens to parents all the time lol, its not your fault she didn't ensure you were prepared BEFORE the night of.", " NTA for setting clear boundaries. It's important that you don't step into anything you're uncomfortable with, especially when you're babysitting! However, did you as her if she had any special needs/requests beforehand? She 100% should've told you, but I do feel that you also had a little responsibility to ask before signing up for it.", "I'm sure the mother was bummed you didn't feel comfortable giving an injection, etc. But she should have mentioned it prior to being halfway out the door! It's a big deal, and her kid's health depends on someone doing it properly. I like your suggestion to her, to work up to a longer stay w/ her 5yo. Assuming she isn't blaming you, NAH.", "NAH. She should have disclosed this and given you basic training beforehand. I understand how since she is so used to this she wouldn't even think about it. You said you were uncomfortable, but followed that with a willingness to learn.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was a bit messy at first.\n\nIt\u2019s ritual now and I do it quickly. I can even get the minimum blood needed for a test much to the amazement of our company doctor and nurse. However, you can fumble and a child might be moving when you need to inject or prick them. It can get messy. \n\nYou were not informed here, and that would put undue risk to the child and liability to you. NTA", "NTA. I'm a mom of four with zero squeamishness about needles and the past experience of giving insulin injections to my mother's friend's cat when he was out of town and I was twelve and walking to his apartment on schedule to feed and medicate her. I wouldn't watch this child with such short notice on the condition.   \n\n\nAt a very minimum I would want to do a play date with them, and walk through the steps several times with the mother first- so a day at the beach or fair or amusement park where there would be multiple checks and doses of insulin, given by me, under the parent's supervision.   \n\n\nHell, even if he had continuous glucose monitoring and a pump, she should have informed you ahead of time and had a meet and greet with you.\n\nAnd all of that is with my experience of parenting and sticking cats with needles. \n\nAlso, as a parent, I could not fathom leaving my kids overnight with a sitter neither my children nor I have ever met before the day. I know that is standard in some situations, but it's way beyond my comfort level. Knowing parents with diabetic kids, I am extra shocked by this situation. None of them would leave their young diabetic children with a new sitter without thorough training of the sitter. Hell, they'd probably seek out another parent of a diabetic child or a diabetic friend, only.", "OP \n\nNTA - I'm guessing that the family has had difficulty finding babysitters and figured that they could \"trick\" you into staying but not telling you until you showed up. You 100% did the right thing by not staying and caring for an child with such a serious medical condition. The fact that she didn't care that you were uncomfortable makes her a new level of AH. I would strongly reconsider ever babysitting for them, even with a trial period.", "NTA. The suggestions to ask about any special needs before agreeing to accept a referral to babysit a kid you've never met & to reach out to the family who referred you to explain your side, are excellent advice.", "NTA    she should have talked to you about it the moment she asked you to babysit, and expected the possibility that you wouldn't be comfortable doing it.\n\nThis is the kind of situation that, if you were okay learning about it, should have been approached with multiple interactions starting slowly, where you could learn about the child's special needs. Not starting with no information, and being expected to care for them overnight. \n\nMy brother is type 1, and I would not be comfortable taking care of the child. The fact that you are willing to learn is commendable. \n\nDon't feel bad, she blindsided you.", "I'm a vet, I deal with diabetic animals and am fine giving injections. I STILL would not look after this kid for anything more than a couple of hours and definitely wouldnt be giving insulin. I'd be terrified. NTA", "NTA. My daughter is t1 and a teen. She went away with her dance group for the first time this weekend. My 16 year old daughter had to stay up all night two nights in a row keeping her alive because her pancreas was trying to kill her. This was not in the realm of normal for her, but at least it also wasn't her sister's first time having to deal with this stuff. She got into dangerously low, seizure or coma type levels and it was terrifying for me to watch on the dexcom as I was texting back and forth with her sister, who again---knows EVERYTHING about her care at this point. \n\nThe reality is that t1 can be completely unpredictable and is not easy for people who don't handle it day in and day out. I'd have not been stressed if she had been having these levels at home. It was stressful because someone who is not her full time caregiver was having to do it.", "NTA\n\nThis was negligent on her part. It could have endangered her child and made you liable if anything happened to him", "Big NTA. My kid has had t1d since she was 2. I never left her with anybody until I found a babysitter who was a nurse.", "NTA\n\nThis was negligent on her part. It could have endangered her child and made you liable if anything happened to him", "NTA I am an adult with Type 1 diabetes and my blood sugar always drops at night, which can be fatal. I have a monitor attached to my stomach that alerts me when I get too high or too low, but it doesn\u2019t always work. Some young children have a service dog that is trained to recognize lows and highs, but a responsible adult is still needed to give insulin or glucose tablets. I am very careful watching my levels but I have still been admitted to the ICU several times. The mother was irresponsible thinking a stranger could take care of her child overnight.", "I am SO glad you commented!

I used to babysit and I remember one job where the mother did inform me beforehand that her son is autistic and has ADHD.  I thought I would be able to handle him for the couple of hours between when she and her husband left and bedtime.  What she failed to mention was the fact her son was never going to go to sleep without her there.  That little shit was up until midnight when the parents finally got home.  The only saving grace that night was the fact that his little sister was an easy child and went down at bedtime."]}
