Since you are neither qualified nor comfortable with performing such a task, you made the right choice.", "NTA.

Don't I find out the day before that her kid is diabetic. Hard nope. She goes over how he can do everything himself (he was 7 or 8 at the time) and I basically won't have to touch a thing. I said \"what if something goes wrong?\" \"It won't.\" \"But what if it does?\" \"You worry too much.\"  \nSorry lady. This is WAY above my paygrade. I walked right out of there and told her no, I don't feel comfortable with that amount of pressure, she called me names and spit at me and screamed so I ran home as fast as I could. I'll tell you what my mom told me:  \n\n\nYou are NOT obligated to care for a child with health concerns that could lead to severe situations. You have the right to say no. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. I\u2019m a nurse and wouldn\u2019t be comfortable caring for a 5 year old diabetic over night that I don\u2019t know.", "NTA.. insulin injects, blood sugars and all diabetic care can be super confusing and overwhelming when you have no experience.. the mom should not have ever put you in that position.", "NTA.\n\nShe blindsided you and was hoping for the best.  Even if the kid just needed to take a pill at bedtime, that sort of thing should have been disclosed when you took the gig.", "NTA. It\u2019s pretty obvious the mom tried to ambush you, and was hoping she could run out of there before you could refuse. Good job standing up for yourself, OP! At 18 years old this is an incredibly useful and important skill to have.", "NTA easy would have been \"mu kid is allergic to peanuts there is no peanuts in the house if you vae some please let them in your car\" not \"here is a list of things to do and if you fail to do them on time my chilmd could die\".", "NTA\n\nSpecial medical needs are something you absolutely deserve to know in advance before agreeing to look after children, and surprising you with that at the last minute is unacceptable.", "NTA.  It\u2019s easy for her because she\u2019s likely used to the routine.  That doesn\u2019t make it a good idea to dump her diabetic child off on a babysitter with no knowledge of diabetes management.", "NTA.

That's important info to just spring on a babysitter.  You did not feel up to it, refusing is well within your rights", "NTA\n\nI am a retired Medical Technologist now called Medical Laboratory Scientist, and sticking needles into small children does not always go well.  I cannot believe the mother wanted to dump her child's care on an inexperienced teenager.  You did the right thing.", "NTA. You did the right thing. This is medical neglect.", "NTA. Any specialized needs for babysitting should be disclosed beforehand. She did not do that.", "NTA - She absolutely should have had you do a trial run before have you babysit for nearly 24 hours with her being hours away. It was irresponsible her to assume that you are willing, never mind responsible enough, to manage her son's diabetes for him. It would be a bit different if he was older, but at 5 he still needs significant supervision.", "NTA! Both my kids have nut allergies and one has asthma, I always stated that up front before arranging care. Springing diabetes and injections on you if insane and mom probably knows it.", "NTA looking after a child with diabetes can be challenging. I\u2019m a teacher and if we get a diabetic child in our class the staff receive special training. \nEven if the child were older and would be able to take point on monitoring would be challenging but a 5 year old needs someone who knows what they are doing, overnight care shouldn\u2019t be left to someone with no experience at all.", "How in the world did the mother think it was a good idea to get a babysitter with no diabetic experience? Sure, it\u2019s easy for her because she knows how to do it, but you cant say the same about others. \n\nNTA", "NTA at all this is above and beyond the realms of standard babysitting and she really should have been upfront about it.\n\nNot to doubt you OP but objectively speaking she was putting her child at risk leaving her with a stranger who had told her they didn't have experience administering that kind of medication.\n\nAllergies are one thing, or a tablet with dinner may be reasonable but this was a lot to expect without warning.", "NTA. NTA in the slightest. You did the right and responsible thing. To look after a child with type 1 diabetes, you need to know what it is, how it happens, what insulin is and how it works, symptoms of DKA and hypoglycaemic episodes, how to carb count, how to give corrections, emergency protocols, when to go to the hospital and when something can be safely treated at home\u2026 I\u2019m a paediatrician from the UK and it\u2019s normal for children and their families to stay in hospital for a few days after their first episode so the specialist nurses can teach them all of the above. If I\u2019m managing them, I\u2019ll reach for the protocol to make sure I\u2019ve not missed anything. \n\nDo not, under any circumstances, agree to babysit this kid if you don\u2019t feel comfortable.", "NTA- also the fact that the kid is 5\u2026 the chances of that kid still being at the phase where they kick and scream is high either resulting in your injury or you fucking up the injection.", "NTA. That's a completely acceptable boundary to have.\n\n I would *also* recommend contacting the family who recommended her to you. Don't blame them for it, just explain the situation that you weren't comfortable with what needed to happen, and say you wanted to give them a heads up in case *she* complains about you to them.", "NTA and honestly the mother should be grateful to you for being upfront and honest about your limitations.", "NTA. Don't expect to hear from here again, but yeah she absolutely should have told you beforehand. Injections are not a normal, expected part of babysitting and usually that \"come over early to go over stuff\" is just about bedtime and where the snacks are, not *medical processes*. Insulin is no big deal when you do it everyday, but it's wild to just assume a teenage babysitter you never met would be fine with it without any prior discussion.", "NTA She didn't tell you deliberately and it's irresponsible on her part not to disclose this information so you could make an informed decision. Leaving a diabetic child with someone who has no experience caring for a diabetic and what to do if the child's blood sugar drops or spikes is the height of irresponsibility.", "Medical needs need to be communicated over the phone before the day of babysitting. NTA", "NTA \n\nThat is something that should have been made aware of prior. You can\u2019t teach someone to do that stuff in 5 minutes and expect child to remain safe and healthy.", "NTA\n\nIt was unreasonable of her to just drop that on you.", "Good grief, you're NTA! It wouldn't even be safe for you to care for a diabetic child when you don't know how and the child really isn't old enough to understand her own medical needs. \n\nI don't know what this mom was thinking! I'm sure she's stressed and tired and needs a break but her child's safety needs to come first.", "NTA. If she has a child with special needs, it's on her to find a babysitter comfortable with these special needs, not spring it at the very last minute.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't feel comfortable doing important medical things that you were completely unprepared for. She's a bit of an AH for blind siding you.", "NTA-A serious medical condition is something the parent should have absolutely been up front about before you agreed to take the job.", "NTA - I (30M) would feel comfortable watching a diabetic baby (5yo is baby), and 18yo me might have been up to the task, but I have been around diabetes my whole life, so it's different.", "NTA\n\nShe wasn't up front with you about the medical condition and continually tried to downplay your concerns.  Only do what you're comfortable doing, especially for an over-night job.", "NTA. My kid is diabetic, it's not as easy to manage as she tried to make it out to be. Too many things could have gone wrong, and I'm sure she'd probably try to blame you if anything happened.", "NTA, diabetes varies based on each person, some have it a lot worse than others, which adds a whole other list of variables. Insulin type, knowledge of safe blood sugar levels, the person's normal blood sugar, amount of insulin to inject if needed and how to determine that, and how much sugar to give them in the event their blood sugar plummets. My dad and most of his family has diabetes, and I work with a lot of people that have it. One of my coworkers has an insulin pump, which that really makes it more complex to deal with cause then you have to keep the blood sugar up to keep up with the pump. Its way too easy to fuck up diabetic care so I dont blame you one bit.", "Yup! NTA, with anything that serious. She should have told you before hand. People struggle with epi pens, let alone insulin injections.", "NTA. You were bring responsible and mature.", "**NTA** \n\n**YOU DID THE RIGHT THING OP!!!** My cousin was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 4 and it was a few years of intense medical training and practice before we were allowed to babysit her and she is *family.* Kids that young cannot recognize or notify you of the symptoms of different problems with their sugars, not to mention struggle with needles and you have no experience calculating or administering proper doses of insulin. \n\nThe child could have slipped into a coma, gone blind, or even died thanks to this mom's recklessness. I understand parents need a break, lord knows my aunt deserved one, but a normal babysitter is not equipped to properly care for a diabetic. There are a million babysitting services that have certified carers and it is completely inappropriate of her to expect you to go in blind. \n\nAll that to say OP, this is not your responsibility and not your fault.", "NTA. Requiring you to test blood sugar and give injections is way outside the normal babysitting expectations, and should have been disclosed beforehand. You wouldn't have walk out \"last minute\" if she had been honest up front; you could have declined when she said it had medical requirements outside your expertise.", "NTA Having to give injections should have been discussed beforehand. Even a quick, \"Oh and are you comfortable giving insulin injections?\" when they were asking you to babysit would have been enough. Its unfortunate that she may have missed her night out, but this happens to parents all the time lol, its not your fault she didn't ensure you were prepared BEFORE the night of.", " NTA for setting clear boundaries. It's important that you don't step into anything you're uncomfortable with, especially when you're babysitting! However, did you as her if she had any special needs/requests beforehand? She 100% should've told you, but I do feel that you also had a little responsibility to ask before signing up for it.", "I'm sure the mother was bummed you didn't feel comfortable giving an injection, etc. But she should have mentioned it prior to being halfway out the door! It's a big deal, and her kid's health depends on someone doing it properly. I like your suggestion to her, to work up to a longer stay w/ her 5yo. Assuming she isn't blaming you, NAH.", "NAH. She should have disclosed this and given you basic training beforehand. I understand how since she is so used to this she wouldn't even think about it. You said you were uncomfortable, but followed that with a willingness to learn.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I always suggest asking if kids have allergies and if so what precautions should I take prior to my arrival, do they take medications, require certain diets, require transportation, have specific routines that need to be stuck to, and are car seats available in the event of an emergency or do I call 911. My won\u2019t do list is non negotiable and I make sure they understand that (for example I won\u2019t drive kids unless it\u2019s an emergency because I don\u2019t trust other drivers in the large city we live in, I don\u2019t do sick kids because I\u2019m a sympathetic barfer, and there are certain medically based things I won\u2019t do). These kinds of things minimize surprises on the job and help set boundaries for everyone. Additionally, I would look into nannying services in your area. Working for a service means families have to be vetted before taken on as a client, you can still do at will jobs, and they can help negotiate things you aren\u2019t comfortable with doing yourself or need back up on, assure you\u2019re being paid and treated fairly, and in some cases provide you with legal coverage in the event you\u2019re accused of something untoward.", "You acted properly.", "NTA.

When my youngest was diagnosed at 14, we all went to classes with his endocrinologist. I learned that nursing school in the 1990s spent very little time on T1D, but focused several lectures on T2D.

If they are still on fingerstick/injection, they are probably also fairly early into his diagnosis. When she calms down from her disappointment, perhaps she will be open to spending a Saturday( with pay) to teach you about caring for her child. \n\n As she progresses through, her child will eventually -soon probably, be put on a continuous glucose monitor/insulin pump. Having a device that alerts you to him having a low blood sugar would be the only way you should babysit overnight. High blood sugar does damage slowly over time ( and the CGM lets you know those too), Low blood sugars can cause seizures and death. The risk of that is very small. The FDA just approved a loop system that has the CGM and insulin pump communicate.

That being said, even I wouldn't have been comfortable watching my neighbor's kid over night b/c I have zero training with it.", "If someone is bothering to hire a babysitter, it implies, \"I care about my kid enough to make sure they survive during my brief absence tonight.\"\n\nThat implication comes with the assumption that you will divulge *crucial* health information beforehand, and make sure the babysitter is adequately prepared to deal with it.\n\nNo one would ever even think to ask, unless they're a worrier type who is going to compulsively ask anyway (for their own peace of mind).", "Ruining two lives", "I replied already, it is possible, it is rare. I had assumed T2- nobody is mocking them.  As a T2 myself, I already know how misunderstood and the disinformation that is out there for diabetes. It's VAST.   \n\nI also don't like people to assume that if you develop T2 it will take two days to learn how to give yourself shots/monitor, because that is far from the norm.   Exceptions, low IQ, etc aside, I just want to ensure readers know, this is unusual and not the norm.  \n\nI've seen people use diabetes also to manipulate others/loved ones as well.  For example, my MIL also diagnosed with T2 in her mid 40's (like me) - used it in some very effed up ways to manipulate her husband/children to take care of her for things she was using her disease as a crutch.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed with it (also strong family history on both sides)- also in my 40's, he was aghast, worried, and also stressed about what care would be required of him.  When he saw how I managed/learned and realized most his childhood involved giving shots, how to fill the syringe, driving for her,  no longer any cooked meals as a young teen, etc...was all a bunch of bs.", "T1 is rarely diagnosed in adulthood, I say rarely because never impossible, it is very rare however.  I was responding to the  poster (labground) that mentioned her mom was a nurse and her dad had to be in hospital several days learning to take injections-I'm imagining this was way into adulthood, assumed it was for her parents around mid life, so T2, and two days in a hospital learning how to give shots seems odd. Unless it was a two day class/outpatient thing? Going over food, understanding the disease, nutrition,  injections, etc...yeah I think that makes more sense. \n\nT2 also is rarely diagnosed overnight to need this level of care with a first time diagnosis (requiring insulin drip, etc).    Unless they NEVER go to the Dr.....people with T2 typically show as pre-diabetes before and get quite a bit of information/familiar with diabetes gradually.  They would also be having regular check-ups to keep up with their A1C, or home testing.  Based on A1c when it's diagnosed, not all start straight with insulin.  Fact is T2 is much easier for patients to control with their eating/lifestlye habits then T1, then again complications can always arrive.\n\nT2 and T1 are very different animals.  Hypos are less likely with T2 then T1 for example, though they occur.  In this case, the mom is insane and OP is NTA, the kid is T1.", "Also, are you in the US? I think this may be the entire reason this seems odd.\n\n  I don't know an insurance/hospital in the US that would approve the care you describe for an adult with T2.  Shoot they spit you out w/in a couple hours out of major surgeries here. \n\nA child/young person with T1, yeah, I can see this happen.  Here if by fat chance a original diagnosis is given for an older patient of T2 that was high enough to require insulin drip for several hours, they'd likely  have you out right after your 2nd test with a follow-up to your pcp or referal to Endo and some pamphlets.", "I have known a few people that were diagnosed T1 diabetics as adults.", "Parent of a T1D, absolutely NOT the asshole and that parent was irresponsible. Hell, my kid didn't even have sleepovers outside the house til she got her pump, with the exception of the one friend who lives a few doors down and their parent is a nurse. Diabetes is no damn joke, and never something I would spring on a sitter.", "It does not seem like you are the asshole in this situation. The woman who hired you as a babysitter did not provide important information about one of the children's medical condition, and then tried to teach you how to give an insulin injection on short notice. This is not only unprofessional, but it also puts the child's health at risk. You were right to decline the job and to express your concerns to the woman. It is also considerate of you to offer to try again in the future, but to request a trial run in order to gain more experience and knowledge about caring for a child with diabetes. It is the responsibility of the parents or caregivers to provide appropriate information and training to anyone who is caring for their child, and the woman in this situation did not do that.", "Who TF tells a teenager they\u2019re entrusting their kid with \u201cyou worry too much\u201d?!?", "OP is very mature to know her limits and also not letting people guilt trip her. Also to be serious about taking care of kids and being responsible for an actual humans life - most adults don't even realize that. \n\nOP, you did the absolute right thing in a very mature and professional way. Well done, don't feel bad. The mom is probably tired and exhausted, and that's sad, but not your responsibility. The health of this kid would be, however.", "As a mom of a T1D you absolutely did the right thing. I could not imagine expecting someone who is not familiar with and comfortable looking after my T1D kid let alone administer insulin!!  Well done for walking away. Doesn\u2019t matter if it is easy for mom, that ask was totally out of line. Especially w out any warning. NTA", "I can\u2019t get past the fact that this woman hired someone she\u2019d never even met, who has never met her children, for an overnight babysit?! Nevermind the diabetes (which makes it 10x crazier).", "That didn\u2019t even occur to me, but OP is expected to not only inject a kid, but inject a 5 year old who doesn\u2019t know her and probably only loosely understands why people keep stabbing him with needles. No chance of that going wrong, no sir. Even if the injections go fine, that kid is going to be a misery to try to keep control of once she starts stabbing him.", "And who withholds important medical information?", "I was thinking this. Even if it wasn't that complex, why do you want to leave your severely chronically ill child overnight with an 18yo who doesn't want to care for him?", "Even when you've been doing it for years it's still so easy to make a mistake. I have to self- inject medicine for my autoimmune disease. It's done via auto injector, so no filling the syringe or need to measure. A couple of weeks ago I still FUBAR'D my injection because the auto injector is different from all the other ones I've ever used and I'm not used to it yet. I was SUPER embarrassed having to call my doctor and let them know I screwed up with the hope they would be willing to give me an office sample so I wouldn't have to wait 2 months until my next injection. And my medicine is NOT life or death. I can't even wrap my head around what this mother could possibly be thinking.", "Not to go casting aspersions, but something in my gut tells me mom wasn't going to be home by Saturday afternoon.", "An adult w car would be best tho.", "Same. It's more common than people think.", "The last minute \"By the way, my child is diabetic\" part aside, what really got me was that, too!  That's not meant in a derogatory way towards OP, although the judgment of the parent is highly questionable.", "The mother likely knows. Doesn't seem to care. This is the type of person who, if the child had ended up having an ER-level crisis on Op's watch, would have no hesitation blaming op for the crisis and ruined weekend.  \n\nBest to stay out of the orbit of people like this, no matter how cute the kids are.", "In which case OP is unnecessary and kid should be with that adult.", "You were taught to do this by a responsible person.  As soon as my kids knew how to read I taught them the word nut then peanut and all the other nuts. Their allergic to nuts. By the time my kids were 3 they wouldn\u2019t take a piece of candy from anyone without asking me first bc they remember how sick (vicious vomit until it was all out of their system for 3-5 hours- not throat swelling)", "It's not just the shot tho, it's whether the kid is trusting, monitoring their food, making sure there are appropriate snacks, checking glucose, figuring out how much insulin to inject based on glucose reading, multiple times/day. \n\nSeparate from mom hours away in the mountains possible sketchy cell phone service and she's partying.\n\nI'd want an adult knowledgeable about diabetes and give them a medical power of attorney to be sure there are no questions about why I'm with this kid if for some reason kid needs ER.", "She wanted to leave you with her diabetic child for a weekend after a five-minute crash course?! And a five-year-old at that.\n\nShe could have avoided this by simply saying this up front. It's not extraordinarily difficult, but like you said, you could've done a trial run or set up time to learn about it earlier. NTA.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nMy younger sister (15) was diagnosed with Type-1 diabetes a little over 6 months ago, and let me tell you it takes much more than an hour or so to learn about diabetes care, and it is absolutely NOT easy starting off. A fuck up like using too much insulin could cost that child\u2019s life.\n\nYou were right to walk out of that situation.", "NTA.\n\nwhat kind of mother leaves her 5 year old, diabetic child overnight with someone who 1) is uncomfortable around needles, 2) had NO experience with injections, and 3) has NO experience with a diabetic child?!!  \n\nan absolutely selfish one, that what. \ud83d\ude21", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was the only reasonable course of action. Think about liability.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: the mom was a MAJOR AH and did that on purpose to guilt you into accepting. A REASONABLE parent would have told you long before ... This is a huge red flag that should have made you run anyway.", "NTA - while I feel sorry for that mom not wanting to miss out, she was very irresponsible towards her child's care. It's never a good idea to leave a child with special needs alone with a stranger without at least 1 meeting to go over vital info. \n\nAnd for a small child that will be needing insulin shots?? WTF is all I can think! \n\nI'm an adult that messed up with eating and my insulin shots a few times and still missed the signs of my bgls going off - and I knew what I was doing! How the hell does that mom think an untrained and inexperienced person will handle a child with diabetes OVERNIGHT???", "NTA. If it was only for a couple of hours my ruling would be different but for an overnight she should have said something WAY sooner than right before she left that it was a special needs child (yes diabetes counts as special needs).", "Not even just out of moral obligation to tell them (although there is that), but because you want your kid to, like, survive the night...", "Yeah, especially because people who are squeamish around needles can actually faint while attempting to give injections, and she didn't think to determine in advance if OP can even physically give an injection? I'm not even scared of needles when it comes to them being used on me or seeing them used on others, but my stomach *dropped* and I started sweating when I tried to give an injection to my dog. I literally froze in place and couldn't make my body do it. It's very different to give someone else an injection than to give yourself one, and often terrifying for people who have never done it before, especially when the stakes are high. And I'm not even squeamish generally. It takes time to build up the confidence to do it. Imagine if OP had been convinced into reluctantly staying and then had passed out while trying to give an injection while alone in the house with small children. Or even just had a panic attack. This is definitely something you need to make sure people can do in advance!", "That reminds me of when my old man was nearing the end of his life - he had cancer and the vet gave him a few weeks but he held on for close to a year and a half, and during that time I got my medical card and started dabbing. \n\nI do not generally approve of giving pets weed, but he did have cancer, and he was so, so, so smart; I\u2019m honestly not sure how he figured out that it made him feel better, but any time he heard a torch, he\u2019d get up and mosey on over, then sit next to the person operating it and look up at them expectantly. If you didn\u2019t blow your vapor over his face, he would look so *hurt,* and cry piteously. Once he got what he wanted, he\u2019d give a little stretch and go take a nap.

Such a good boy.)\n\nI really hope it made his last days easier; rest in peace, sweet Elmo.", "I that hate your friend, a child, was sick and is still dealing with it. But I absolutely adore that she gave a presentation to the class and helped everyone understand what was happening.

So it wasn't so much teaching him as monitoring that he handled it well.", "I learned very early on to check things for citric acid, and to decline things if I didn't know what was in them.

That is seriously dangerous for the child, and makes me wonder how well his diabetes is actually being managed by the mother even when she's there.", "My aunt did the same thing with my niece, even though she was too young to ever remember having a reaction, by 3 it was normal to her to take any offered food to her parent and they would check the ingredients together.", "Wow. TIL adults can develop type I. Amazing \ud83d\ude2e The more you know I guess", "Yep. Things go wrong. The only person who babysits my 10-year old son with Type 1 diabetes is my mother.
