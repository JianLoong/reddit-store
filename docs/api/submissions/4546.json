Since you are neither qualified nor comfortable with performing such a task, you made the right choice.", "NTA. I had that same experience when I was 16.  \nA friend of a woman I sat for wanted to hire me for a few nights, and I was totally ok with it (what with her price range, 200 a night! ok!).\n\nWell. Don't I find out the day before that her kid is diabetic. Hard nope. She goes over how he can do everything himself (he was 7 or 8 at the time) and I basically won't have to touch a thing. I said \"what if something goes wrong?\" \"It won't.\" \"But what if it does?\" \"You worry too much.\"  \nSorry lady. This is WAY above my paygrade. I walked right out of there and told her no, I don't feel comfortable with that amount of pressure, she called me names and spit at me and screamed so I ran home as fast as I could. I'll tell you what my mom told me:  \n\n\nYou are NOT obligated to care for a child with health concerns that could lead to severe situations. You have the right to say no. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. I\u2019m a nurse and wouldn\u2019t be comfortable caring for a 5 year old diabetic over night that I don\u2019t know.", "NTA.. insulin injects, blood sugars and all diabetic care can be super confusing and overwhelming when you have no experience.. the mom should not have ever put you in that position.", "NTA.\n\nShe blindsided you and was hoping for the best.  Even if the kid just needed to take a pill at bedtime, that sort of thing should have been disclosed when you took the gig.", "NTA. It\u2019s pretty obvious the mom tried to ambush you, and was hoping she could run out of there before you could refuse. Good job standing up for yourself, OP! At 18 years old this is an incredibly useful and important skill to have.", "NTA easy would have been \"mu kid is allergic to peanuts there is no peanuts in the house if you vae some please let them in your car\" not \"here is a list of things to do and if you fail to do them on time my chilmd could die\".", "NTA\n\nSpecial medical needs are something you absolutely deserve to know in advance before agreeing to look after children, and surprising you with that at the last minute is unacceptable.", "NTA.  It\u2019s easy for her because she\u2019s likely used to the routine.  That doesn\u2019t make it a good idea to dump her diabetic child off on a babysitter with no knowledge of diabetes management.", "NTA. If you\u2019re not comfortable and have no prior knowledge, it\u2019s honestly in everyone\u2019s best interest that you aren\u2019t solely responsible for the diabetic 5 year old.", "NTA.  That's important info to just spring on a babysitter.  You did not feel up to it, refusing is well within your rights", "NTA\n\nI am a retired Medical Technologist now called Medical Laboratory Scientist, and sticking needles into small children does not always go well.  I cannot believe the mother wanted to dump her child's care on an inexperienced teenager.  You did the right thing.", "NTA. You did the right thing. This is medical neglect.", "NTA. Any specialized needs for babysitting should be disclosed beforehand. She did not do that.", "NTA - She absolutely should have had you do a trial run before have you babysit for nearly 24 hours with her being hours away. It was irresponsible her to assume that you are willing, never mind responsible enough, to manage her son's diabetes for him. It would be a bit different if he was older, but at 5 he still needs significant supervision.", "NTA! Both my kids have nut allergies and one has asthma, I always stated that up front before arranging care. Springing diabetes and injections on you if insane and mom probably knows it.", "NTA looking after a child with diabetes can be challenging. I\u2019m a teacher and if we get a diabetic child in our class the staff receive special training. \nEven if the child were older and would be able to take point on monitoring would be challenging but a 5 year old needs someone who knows what they are doing, overnight care shouldn\u2019t be left to someone with no experience at all.", "How in the world did the mother think it was a good idea to get a babysitter with no diabetic experience? Sure, it\u2019s easy for her because she knows how to do it, but you cant say the same about others. \n\nNTA", "NTA at all this is above and beyond the realms of standard babysitting and she really should have been upfront about it.\n\nNot to doubt you OP but objectively speaking she was putting her child at risk leaving her with a stranger who had told her they didn't have experience administering that kind of medication.\n\nAllergies are one thing, or a tablet with dinner may be reasonable but this was a lot to expect without warning.", "NTA. NTA in the slightest. You did the right and responsible thing. To look after a child with type 1 diabetes, you need to know what it is, how it happens, what insulin is and how it works, symptoms of DKA and hypoglycaemic episodes, how to carb count, how to give corrections, emergency protocols, when to go to the hospital and when something can be safely treated at home\u2026 I\u2019m a paediatrician from the UK and it\u2019s normal for children and their families to stay in hospital for a few days after their first episode so the specialist nurses can teach them all of the above. If I\u2019m managing them, I\u2019ll reach for the protocol to make sure I\u2019ve not missed anything. \n\nDo not, under any circumstances, agree to babysit this kid if you don\u2019t feel comfortable.", "NTA- also the fact that the kid is 5\u2026 the chances of that kid still being at the phase where they kick and scream is high either resulting in your injury or you fucking up the injection.", "NTA. That's a completely acceptable boundary to have.\n\n I would *also* recommend contacting the family who recommended her to you. Don't blame them for it, just explain the situation that you weren't comfortable with what needed to happen, and say you wanted to give them a heads up in case *she* complains about you to them.", "NTA and honestly the mother should be grateful to you for being upfront and honest about your limitations.", "NTA. Don't expect to hear from here again, but yeah she absolutely should have told you beforehand. Injections are not a normal, expected part of babysitting and usually that \"come over early to go over stuff\" is just about bedtime and where the snacks are, not *medical processes*. Insulin is no big deal when you do it everyday, but it's wild to just assume a teenage babysitter you never met would be fine with it without any prior discussion.", "NTA She didn't tell you deliberately and it's irresponsible on her part not to disclose this information so you could make an informed decision. Leaving a diabetic child with someone who has no experience caring for a diabetic and what to do if the child's blood sugar drops or spikes is the height of irresponsibility.", "Medical needs need to be communicated over the phone before the day of babysitting. NTA", "NTA \n\nThat is something that should have been made aware of prior. You can\u2019t teach someone to do that stuff in 5 minutes and expect child to remain safe and healthy.", "NTA\n\nIt was unreasonable of her to just drop that on you.", "Good grief, you're NTA! It wouldn't even be safe for you to care for a diabetic child when you don't know how and the child really isn't old enough to understand her own medical needs. \n\nI don't know what this mom was thinking! I'm sure she's stressed and tired and needs a break but her child's safety needs to come first.", "NTA. If she has a child with special needs, it's on her to find a babysitter comfortable with these special needs, not spring it at the very last minute.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't feel comfortable doing important medical things that you were completely unprepared for. She's a bit of an AH for blind siding you.", "NTA-A serious medical condition is something the parent should have absolutely been up front about before you agreed to take the job.", "NTA - I (30M) would feel comfortable watching a diabetic baby (5yo is baby), and 18yo me might have been up to the task, but I have been around diabetes my whole life, so it's different.", "NTA\n\nShe wasn't up front with you about the medical condition and continually tried to downplay your concerns.  Only do what you're comfortable doing, especially for an over-night job.", "NTA. My kid is diabetic, it's not as easy to manage as she tried to make it out to be. Too many things could have gone wrong, and I'm sure she'd probably try to blame you if anything happened.", "NTA, diabetes varies based on each person, some have it a lot worse than others, which adds a whole other list of variables. Insulin type, knowledge of safe blood sugar levels, the person's normal blood sugar, amount of insulin to inject if needed and how to determine that, and how much sugar to give them in the event their blood sugar plummets. My dad and most of his family has diabetes, and I work with a lot of people that have it. One of my coworkers has an insulin pump, which that really makes it more complex to deal with cause then you have to keep the blood sugar up to keep up with the pump. Its way too easy to fuck up diabetic care so I dont blame you one bit.", "Yup! NTA, with anything that serious. She should have told you before hand. People struggle with epi pens, let alone insulin injections.", "NTA. You were bring responsible and mature.", "**NTA** \n\n**YOU DID THE RIGHT THING OP!!!** My cousin was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 4 and it was a few years of intense medical training and practice before we were allowed to babysit her and she is *family.* Kids that young cannot recognize or notify you of the symptoms of different problems with their sugars, not to mention struggle with needles and you have no experience calculating or administering proper doses of insulin. \n\nThe child could have slipped into a coma, gone blind, or even died thanks to this mom's recklessness. I understand parents need a break, lord knows my aunt deserved one, but a normal babysitter is not equipped to properly care for a diabetic. There are a million babysitting services that have certified carers and it is completely inappropriate of her to expect you to go in blind. \n\nAll that to say OP, this is not your responsibility and not your fault.", "NTA. Requiring you to test blood sugar and give injections is way outside the normal babysitting expectations, and should have been disclosed beforehand. You wouldn't have walk out \"last minute\" if she had been honest up front; you could have declined when she said it had medical requirements outside your expertise.", "NTA Having to give injections should have been discussed beforehand. Even a quick, \"Oh and are you comfortable giving insulin injections?\" when they were asking you to babysit would have been enough. Its unfortunate that she may have missed her night out, but this happens to parents all the time lol, its not your fault she didn't ensure you were prepared BEFORE the night of.", " NTA for setting clear boundaries. It's important that you don't step into anything you're uncomfortable with, especially when you're babysitting! However, did you as her if she had any special needs/requests beforehand? She 100% should've told you, but I do feel that you also had a little responsibility to ask before signing up for it.", "I'm sure the mother was bummed you didn't feel comfortable giving an injection, etc. But she should have mentioned it prior to being halfway out the door! It's a big deal, and her kid's health depends on someone doing it properly. I like your suggestion to her, to work up to a longer stay w/ her 5yo. Assuming she isn't blaming you, NAH.", "NAH. She should have disclosed this and given you basic training beforehand. I understand how since she is so used to this she wouldn't even think about it. You said you were uncomfortable, but followed that with a willingness to learn.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Diabetics especially those who is insulin dependent (Type 1 and 2) can take a turn for worse very fast and need immediate action from trained persons. You did the best and responsible thing to do. NTA all the way", "NTA.  She's definitely not a caring mother either.  Who can leave their children with someone that they have never met before?  Let alone a life affecting disease that requires injections and not think that is critical information with whom you've asked to care for your children.   Her poor child.", "NTA, you\u2019re completely right, I imagine the mum has just got so used to it she forgot how serious and scary it is to learn this stuff in the beginning. I\u2019m a lot older than you and I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable caring for a young child with T1 without a lot of training- it\u2019s a really serious thing.", "NTA\n\nI found it a challenge to manage my own gestational diabetes.  I had to be trained to understand it and monitor and manage it.  How on earth can you be expected to be quickly shown how to handle type 1?  That\u2019s serious stuff.  That mom was lucky you\u2019re responsible enough to know your limitations.", "NTA", "NTA!!   Holy crap - I can't believe she expected you to do this with zero notice!  I'm an adult with Type 2 diabetes and I would not trust my husband to figure anything out except \"Call 911 if I pass out or act really weird.\"  And this was a 5-year old kid.  OMG....  just NO!  Now, if he was a responsible teenager who could help you with the numbers and give his own injections, and you had watched him before and you both felt comfortable with it, then maybe.  But a 5-year old can't tell you correctly how he feels and by the time you figured it out it might be too late.  People die from diabetes every day.  Those parents had zero right to drop this on anyone!", "NTA\n\n1) You have absolutely no experience with caring for a diabetic child. It's not something that can be taught in a five-minute rundown.\n\n2) Without the parent providing some sort of medical proxy that would allow you to make medical decisions in the event of an emergency, you've got a potential nightmare situation on your hands.\n\n3) And without some sort of agreement that protects you from liability should something unexpected happen, you're opening yourself up to a lawsuit. (It's one thing if a kid gets a broken arm because they fell off their bike; it's a whole other if they go into a diabetic coma.)", "NTA \n\nAs a parent she should've been more concerned with the fact you weren't comfortable and understood. The fact that she kept pushing you to watch her kid, something you were not qualified for or comfortable with is extremely irresponsible of her", "NTA, once she took out a needle it's not on you. \nI don't expect her to hire you again tho.", "NTA.  my husband became diabetic as a side effect of chemotherapy.   We did two days of classes.  \n\nI would never expect a sitter that I didn't know, and had 0 experience with a diabetic child and 0 experience giving injections to a child.  To babysit period.  \n\nIt's insane not to inform anyone of that, in a caregiving situation.", "NTA. Diabetes can be deadly if mismanaged. You might have saved that child a hospital trip or their life by walking out.", "NTA. She should have discussed the care you needed to provide to the 5yo. I suspect she didn't tell you because she thought you would say no right away if she told you. You made the right choice. You have no experience with kids with diabetes. It was irresponsible for her to even ask without informing you first.", "NTA. She should have disclosed this information right from the start. She is so recless to leave a child overnight in a care of a person who doesn't know a thing about how to deal with diabetes.", "NTA, one of my kids has type 1 and I wouldn't let anyone administer their meds if they weren't comfortable. Also that's something you disclose to a sitter before the day of.", "NTA she should have given you all the information up front and you could have had time to learn and/or practice with her watching! I would not feel comfortable either. Way too dangerous if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing", "NTA. She should have told you sooner, checked how comfortable you were with the needle situation, and given you the opportunity to learn all the stuff you would need to know BEFORE the weekend of her outing. It was unfair of her to spring that on you right before she was planning to leave and I'm glad you didn't stay in a situation that could have been harmful to you and to her child.", "NTA I\u2019m a nanny and something like that should never be a surprise. You did the right thing to take care of that child", "NTA it was wildly irresponsible of her to try and leave her diabetic 5 year old with someone they had never met and had never done an insulin injection overnight.", "NTA\n\nYou did the responsible thing. \n\nWhat's easy and familiar to her is not to you and it's a dangerous situation to throw you into. \n\nIt's very likely that if the child's condition is well managed and you stick to their routine, all would be fine .... But even all fine needs training for you. \n\nDon't feel bad at all, she absolutely created the situation herself. You stepped up and did the responsible thing.", "NTA.  You made the right decision here.  Dealing with a type 1 diabetic 5yr old child with no experience - on an overnight stay - just isn't a good idea.  The mom shouldn't have sprung that on you at the last minute.  The fact that she would be good with giving you 5 minutes of 'training' and then leave for overnight is a red flag with this person.  \n\nGood for you for recognizing that this wasn't a good situation - for you or the child - and deciding to decline staying.", "NTA\n\nA T1 is not something you sprung on an 18year old you have never met who is going to have your kids for an overnight.  This mom was the AH who didn\u2019t plan ahead.", "NTA ALL THE WAY UP TO THE MOUNTAINS!\n\nWTAF is she thinking?!?  She can't impose you to handle her diabetic child without your knowledge.  That's bad idea.  You're not even trained to do that.  You did the right thing by backing out of the babysitting job.  If she had explained that over the phone to discuss the babysitting, it would give you time to refuse it but no she didn't.  She should have asked all the babysitters if they know how to use or whatever.  So that mom is TA for springing it on you.", "NTA at all. Former special ed teacher and current special needs nanny, this is such an uncomfortable and stressful thing to have dropped on you and WILDLY irresponsible of the parent to not tell you in advance. I have a very hard time believing that she didn\u2019t know that would be a turn off for most people so left it out until it was \u201ctoo late\u201d. \n\nI grew up with a diabetic friend who didn\u2019t take good care of her diabetes and I remember how stressful sleepovers were with her pump going off, her blood sugar monitor just saying \u201cHigh\u201d or \u201cLow\u201d because the numbers were so bad, and me panic calling my mom (a nurse) on what to do (her parents weren\u2019t helpful people). You were being set up for failure and I\u2019m so glad you didn\u2019t stay because it could have gone sideways so easily. \n\n\nMy biggest recommendation for you, or anyone who babysits/nannies, is have a list of questions and a \u201cwill do/won\u2019t do\u201d list so it\u2019s all out there before anyone agrees to anything. I always suggest asking if kids have allergies and if so what precautions should I take prior to my arrival, do they take medications, require certain diets, require transportation, have specific routines that need to be stuck to, and are car seats available in the event of an emergency or do I call 911. My won\u2019t do list is non negotiable and I make sure they understand that (for example I won\u2019t drive kids unless it\u2019s an emergency because I don\u2019t trust other drivers in the large city we live in, I don\u2019t do sick kids because I\u2019m a sympathetic barfer, and there are certain medically based things I won\u2019t do). These kinds of things minimize surprises on the job and help set boundaries for everyone. Additionally, I would look into nannying services in your area. Working for a service means families have to be vetted before taken on as a client, you can still do at will jobs, and they can help negotiate things you aren\u2019t comfortable with doing yourself or need back up on, assure you\u2019re being paid and treated fairly, and in some cases provide you with legal coverage in the event you\u2019re accused of something untoward.", "You acted properly.", "NTA.  Dealt with childhood onset diabetes.  Any parent that is that casual about it, puts their child at risk.  You were right to walk away.  I would also talk to the person that Refered her and say she made you incredibly uncomfortable because that child has a serious medical condition that can result in coma and death if not managed properly.", "NTA, this is a disaster waiting to happen, and maybe even grave bodily harm.", "Nta. She should have had you come over beforehand a few times to learn and make sure you feel comfortable with finger sticks, monitoring, and injections.\n\nI wouldn't even feel comfortable leaving my child with someone who didn't know these things. Having worked with young diabetic children, their blood sugar can plummet without warning and suddenly youre frantically trying to keep a kid out of the hospital and out of a coma. You need to feel prepared to handle those situations.", "You made a very wise decision! You are nta. The mother on the other hand is.", "NTA \n\nI'm baffled that she was ready to leave her 5YO kid overnight with an absolute stranger, diabetes or not. No trial run or meeting each other first? I wouldn't even let someone watch my dogs (overnight) who hasn't met them first.", "NTA. I'm the mother of a Type1 Diabetic, and would never leave someone to give injections without fully vetting and training them first. That's insane.\n\nWhile yes, it isn't that hard, (ONCE YOU ARE TRAINED!) there is a lot that can go wrong (too much insulin will KILL) and there's a lot of training that ought to go into that. Not a 15 minute spiel, a good multiple HOURS of training and injection practice.\n\nThis woman didn't care about the well-being of her child. That's insane.", "NTA.  That mother is absolutely not thinking straight.  You did the right thing.  She should not be dropping a child with specialized medical needs on you for an overnight without proper preparation.", "NTA. How can the mom be comfortable leaving her special needs kid to someone who does not have enough knowledge about her kids condition and expects them to administer injections? I know those injections are mostly pre-dosed, but still! There's always room for error.", "NTA.   The mom is crazy.  No one should want a babysitter who is uncomfortable with job requirements.", "NTA", "NTA. I am astounded that a parent would try to leave their 5-year-old overnight with a new sitter that they just met, let alone the kid having diabetes and they thought a 5 minute chat would suffice. oof. This is CPS level.", "NTA. That is terrifying that she would just leave her child with someone who has no experience or knowledge in diabetes. Literally, you could have accidentally killed her child. I (diabetic) am continually going over all the things with my husband in case I fall out and he needs to handle me, and we\u2019ve been married over a decade.", "NTA. That mother is a huge AH though. As a mom I could not imagine leaving my children over night with a teen that I had just met. Add health issues into the equation and that\u2019s a huge no", "NTA, you aren't qualified, you told her, she didn't want to hear it.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s a lot to be responsible for on short notice and with limited training even if Mom was just going to be a short distance away.", ">Apparently, one of the kids (5yo) has type one diabetes, and she didn\u2019t think that it would be important to let me know beforehand\n\nNTA\n\nThe above is a MAJOR red flag. Diabetes is a huge deal, especially in such a young child. It quite literally is life and death. You definitely made the right decision.", "my own dad refused to give me insulin injections lmao, you are perfectly within your right not to want to deal with a young child w diabetes", "NTA. You sound rational and responsible, with a good sense of your boundaries and limitations. It will royally piss off people who like to steamroll over other people's boundaries, and you will see it throughout your life, but stick to being you. Well done!", "I had to learn to do insulin injections when I worked as a resident assistant at a assisted living facility and I trained for two days to do it not five minutes", "No chance a Type 1 parent tried to hire a babysitter without telling them in advance, and making damn sure they knew how to handle it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource? My kid is type 1, and I talk with a lot of other parents in same situation.  Doing a wrong injection can kill your kid.  No way are you letting some 18 year old with no other training or experience take your type 1 kid for an overnight.   \n\n\nYTA for trolling.", "NTA, as a teacher my wife has 2 kids in her class with diabetes and she and other staff had to have special training, not just for administering insulin but also to understand blood sugar levels, the effect of foods etc. \n\nThis is not the kind of stuff you learn in a 5 minute chat before someone walks out the door and entrusts their kid to you", "I'd honestly not want to babysit for this woman in the future regardless. \n\nWho leaves their kids with someone THEY'VE NEVER MET BEFORE for the first time for an overnight babysitting gig?! wtf.", "> I told her that I wasn\u2019t comfortable, and she just said \u201coh don\u2019t worry it\u2019s easy\u201d and then tried to show me how to give an insulin injection.\n\n\\-aaaaaand I stopped reading right there.  NTA.", "T1 here. \n\nCan you imagine if the kid has a low blood sugar in the night? OP might not have even woken up to catch it. (And given the kid is getting injections and not on a pump, there\u2019s probably no CGM).", "Brother of a type 1 Diabetic here - so much NTA OP. \n\nAll it takes is mistaking the slow release vs rapid one time, and you\u2019re in a diabetic coma. You prepare the dose, inject before bed, the child will not wake up in the morning. This is not a hyperbole, it\u2019s a reality I\u2019ve witnessed firsthand. \n\nDiabetes is manageable, but putting that pressure on someone and going so far as to diminish the perception of the consequences?! \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy\u201d ok sure, but this totally disregards probability vs severity. The probability you do something wrong may be low, but the severity of consequences for that child could be huge and life changing.", "Right. NTA. You showed excellent judgment OP.", "As a type 1 of over 30 years, I can assure you that things do, in fact, go wrong on occasion. That mum was delusional to try to convince you otherwise.", "Or her child!", "Agreed. It can be taught to somebody without a medical background, but to spring it on somebody like that is not the way to teach a person. NTA.", "Yeah... I feel for the mom. Being new in the area, and I'm sure she could use a break. But this wasn't the way to go about it...", "Desperate, selfishly hopeful and stupid.", "Lmao @ the mom saying \u201cit\u2019s easy\u201d ma\u2019am it\u2019s not easy for us type one diabetics OURSELVES what makes you think a teenager with zero experience could handle a 5 year old with it?? \n\nNTA OP, that mom is wild lol.", "Unfortunately you would be shocked about how much people can be strange. \n\nSource? I was 16y volunteering with kids and someone sent a 7y with old type 1 and insuline without telling anybody. Luck was one of the older volunteers where in her last years of medicine.", "Both my parents had to work with my endo nurse to learn how to give injections and they still don't like doing it. I would never ask someone I barely know to understand the care that a Type One needs. Even nurses at some schools I've gone to had to get retrained when I started there because I was their first Type One in years and was using equipment that they had never used. \n\nEven when I was diagnosed, I was in the hospital for \"Type One Training\" for three days to learn what I needed to do to not die. Asking someone to learn all that in five minutes seems impossible to me.", "Entrusts the kid overnight at that!  Yeesh", "That's right.  It takes time to learn all that, not five minutes before the AH mom leaves the house.  OP is not even trained to give the shots and check the glucose level before and after the meals.  Yes I had dealt with my late husband with type 2 diabetes.  No insulin.....only meds but do glucose level daily.", "Especially for a 5 year old! At 5, there's no way the kid is reading their own stats, calculating how much insulin they need, preparing the dosage, and injecting it themselves. Even if the kid was 11 and mostly doing that themselves, you would still want an informed, trained babysitter and probably a trial run with mom still fairly close by.", "Especially if you are an 18yo with no medical training whatsoever. What kind of mother expects a teen she's never met to both monitor symptoms they're not familiar with and administer medication to a 5yo for an overnight trip. Does she not know how wrong diabetes could get in a 24hr period without proper skills and knowledge to treat it or does she not care?\n\nOP, you were the responsible one in this situation.", "Yeah seriously. Like holy shit. Leaving your kids overnight with a stranger would be bad enough even without the medical complication. Plus that kid is only 5 so it\u2019s not like he can manage his condition by himself yet.", "Seriously. T1 also and  horrified at this mother's thoughtlessness. If it was a teenager who could mostly handle their own care, maybe it would be ok to give a five minute rundown, but a 5yo?", "Yep, my friend of 40+ years is T1D and has been for the past 43 years.\n\nThings are fine, until they're not... :-(", "That's what the worst part is - the callous disregard of her child's safety!", "YUP. The kid is 5 years old.  Absolutely not.  I have plenty of adult relatives with diabetes and its not an easy feet with some of them getting sugar lows and having to have some emergency candy etc.  They're adults and can ask. But a young child? That's dangerous.", "Absolutely! I should have included the child too!", "It can absolutely be taught!! My grandma is a diabetic and I learned all of the necessary steps of blood sugars and insulin shots, but it was gradual learning.", "I think the mom was just trying to manipulate OP in to sitting rather than paying extra for a sitter who is qualified to watch a child with T1D (and probably costs a LOT more than OP).", "LOL totally this.

I offer it a blood sacrifice and sometimes that makes it stop.\" Reason my numbers were going up? I hit my knee on the counter and was in a heap of pain.

Nahhhhh.", "Right?\n\nJust because someone is a parent to a child with a condition doesn\u2019t mean they automatically are an advocate for them, act in their best interest, or are on top of things.\n\nI too have seen it happen a few times where a parent didn\u2019t disclose important medical information.", "My mother is a nurse and my dad was still in hospital for 2 days to be trained when he started on injections", "NTA and honestly the mother should be grateful to you for being upfront and honest", "Of course it can be taught how else would anyone know how to do it. But it can't reasonably be taught in 5 minutes as the mom is halfway out the door.", "And I didn\u2019t say it could be taught in 5 minutes. i was taught gradually when it came to my grandmother.
