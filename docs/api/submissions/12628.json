Our parents own a vacation home. When I moved out they decided to move there permanently. \n\nThey\u2019ve only been back once so I recently decided to visit them. \n\nMom and Rae were talking and my plans came up. She called and asked why I didn\u2019t tell her I was planning to go to Cali. I said it had nothing to do with her so why would I have to tell her anything. \n\nShe said it made no sense for us to do separate trips when we could just go together. I said she\u2019s acting extremely entitled to something she had no parts in and I\u2019m not obligated to include her in every plan I make. She said she just wants our parents to meet her son. I said he\u2019s like 5 months you had plenty of time to take him if it was important.\n\nThen she cried to mom. Ma said it was a good idea. I said if Rae cared so much she would\u2019ve planned to see them on her own. She told me she really needs this. \n\nI told Rae if she comes she can\u2019t ask me for shit I\u2019m not helping with her kid act like I\u2019m not even there. She agreed. \n\nThe day came and our connecting flight was delayed so we had to stay the night. I was trying to fall asleep. She asked me if I was really going to sleep. I was annoyed. I said \u201cIf you leave me tf alone.\u201d \n\nLater she asked me to watch the baby. I said just hold him and go to sleep. She was scared someone would snatch him while she slept. I said she sounds fkn crazy and no one wants her kid. She said she was exhausted and had been drinking energy drinks all night but she was crashing and tried to put him in my arms again. I said \u201cThis is exactly why you should\u2019ve just stayed tf at home. I told you from jump I\u2019m not doing shit. You already forced your way here now you\u2019re just gonna have to figure it out.\u201d She said \u201cSeriously? I\u2019m fkn exhausted I can barely even keep my eyes open\u201c I said \u201cThen go to sleep\u201c and closed my eyes. She knew what the terms were.\n\nWe made it there but later mom asked if she really raised me to be so cold towards my sister. She told me she had broken down and had a mental meltdown. I said I love my sister but she should grow up and stop being so dramatic about a situation she put herself in. She said it wouldn\u2019t have hurt to help her even just a little. I told her I didn\u2019t help her make the baby and she should\u2019ve known something could go wrong when traveling. \n\nWe got back a week ago and haven\u2019t spoken to each other at all but she texted me today how hurt she was and she feels like I don\u2019t care about her or my nephew at all. I told her she knew what she was getting into when she begged to come and imposed on my trip. She said she thought I would\u2019ve changed my mind when I realized we would have to sleep in the airport and that she would\u2019ve done it for me. I said \u201cYour kid. You\u2019re responsibility.\u201d I might be willing to just apologize to shut her up if people say I\u2019m the AH.", "created_utc": 1679177297, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11v2eud/aita_for_not_helping_my_sister_watch_my_nephew/", "score": 4624, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or of you two not getting on for other reasons?\n\nOn the one hand, you did set your boundaries and your sister pushed past them (or tried to, anyway).  She does suck for that.\n\nOn the other hand, the circumstances were such that I'd expect a loving family member to put previous conversations aside and help out for the sake of the innocent infant they should surely love.  You do come across as cold in that regard.\n\nBut, if this is just the last straw after years of your sister trampling all over your clearly defined boundaries then I can understand that and could see why you were reluctant to travel with her in the first place.\n\nWith the current information available, I'm going with ESH (except the baby).", "You can be technically correct and still be morally wrong. ESH. Your sister for latching on to your trip and forcing you into the situation in the first place. And you for the absolute callousness with which you regard your sister and nephew. In extenuating circumstances like a flight delay, all it needs is a LITTLE give and take to make everyone's experience a LOT easier.\n\nI would never wish for anyone to have you as a relative. You seem to treat relationships as purely rules-based zero sum games. What an awful awful way to live, let's hope you never find yourself in a situation where you need someone else's help.", "ESH. Your sister did sound a bit entitled but fucking hell you sound like an absolute peach. There are several ways to handle the shit life throws at you, you chose poorly.", "You are not obligated to include your sister in your travel plans although I do think that, in theory, it sounds like a nice idea to visit your parents together. Nothing wrong with a little family get together. \n\nIn reality though, you sound terribly cold like your mother said. Do you hate your sister? Do you hate your nephew? You sound like you do. It wouldn't kill you to be a tiny bit helpful, especially in extenuating circumstances. What's your problem? \n\nIf that's how you were going to act, your answer should have been a hard no when your sister asked to tag along. Had she known that's how you were going to act, I'm certain she wouldn't have asked. You took a great opportunity to spend quality time with your sister and her sweet baby and shat all over it.\n\nYTA", "A technical NTA, but you do appear to be a rather unpleasant type.", "This whole story makes no sense.  Why haven\u2019t the grandparents come to visit?  They could afford two homes but not one trip back to the place they used to live to see their new grand baby?\n\nYour flight was delayed overnight in an airport but they didn\u2019t send you to a hotel.\n\nAnd sister is traveling with a 5 month old but has no stroller to let baby sleep in and also doesn\u2019t just spread out a blanket on the floor.\n\nOP sounds weirdly cold and completely detached, but sister and mom sound lazy and whiny.  They all sound horrible.", "NTA. She wormed her way into your trip with the agreement that you would not be babysitting. Then she proceeded to forget that agreement and try to get you to babysit. You are not obligated to watch a kid that is not yours. \n\nI will give the benefit of the doubt and say that it does sound like you resent your sister for having a baby, or maybe the circumstances she had the baby in.", "NTA you said right from start you didn't want to take care of the baby. She tried to guilt you into it. As the youngest of 4 kids I was always stuck taking care of my nieces. I had no choice. I'd get in shit if I didn't. Good on you for sticking to your guns!", "NTA. OP said she wanted to visit on her own. Sis wants to bring the baby, who her mom has not met.  Now OP\u2019s trip is going to be about the new baby and sis being an overwhelmed mom. OP was on the same trip - why is sis more entitled to sleep than OP is?  I think sis and mom were both the AH on this one.", "YTA. Your entire post reeks of being a mean-spirited and terrible sister & aunt.", "NTA\nSis already knew where you stood. She hitched onto your trip and then expected you to take care of her child, that\u2019s a no.\nYes you can love people dearly and still not have to do anything you aren\u2019t comfortable with. I\u2019m so tired of, \u201cbut they are family.\u201d\nNo one is responsible for your child but you.", "NTA.  OP had made her plans, and her biggest mistake was not sticking to her \u201cnope.\u201d  If you\u2019re not into babies, it\u2019s best to stay away from them.  The whole trip will revolve around the baby.  And let\u2019s not pretend delays are a surprise in cross country flights.  Sister presumably has a partner of some sort and that\u2019s who should be accompanying her to her parents\u2019 home.", "NTA, you didn\u2019t want her to come on the trip, and you told her you wouldn\u2019t babysit. You wanted a solo trip to visit your parents, her expectations are unreasonable since you guys are obviously not that close, and that\u2019s okay. Yes you could have been nicer, but it\u2019s on her to put herself in a situation where she wasn\u2019t wanted, also with significant delays you guys could have required for a hotel room if she was too exhausted.", "Technically NTA because you set your conditions and stuck to them but damn if I was your sister I would really be questioning whether I wanted you in my life or not. They way you talk to her and about her is really awful. it doesn\u2019t seem like you want her in your life either. \n\nAlso, baby snatching is a very real and dangerous possibility. So you were technically in your right to say no, this was a situation where a fraction of kindness and empathy would have went a long way.", "YTA. You don't sound like a very nice person. You obviously hate your sister and her child. You hate them so much you were willing to put a baby in an unsafe situation. Your sister could have fallen asleep with him and dropped him. You said no one wants her child but kidnappings happen all of the time. Trafficking is an issue and its especially easy with babies. \n\nIdk why you hate her so much but maybe just stay away from them.", "ESH. \nYour sister for hijacking your trip.\nYou way more so for being cold AF. \n\nYour sister has a new baby and her husband is gone a lot on an oil rig. Her baby is 5 months old and your parents haven\u2019t met him, which means your mom hasn\u2019t been there to help her adjust to new motherhood. You *obviously* haven\u2019t been a support to her during this time by the tone of this post. She probably heard you were going to see your parents, realized she had an opportunity to travel with another adult in case of emergency, and desperately needed some kind of human contact and support. Reading this makes me feel so bad for your sister. Becoming a mom alters your entire reality. Doing it with an incredible support system was hard as fuck, and your sister sounds like she has a really shitty one. \n\nOf course she said she wouldn\u2019t make you help with her son, because I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t plan to. Flying from NYC to CA, I\u2019m sure she figured she\u2019d be fine. Extenuating circumstances created a situation in which any rational adult would assist their loved one, if only for the well-being of the child and not because of..idk, empathy? Which you clearly have none of. \n\nCaring for an infant with no sleep is *dangerous for the infant.* Sleeping while holding an infant is *dangerous for the infant.* Both adults sleeping in the middle of an airport with no one watching the infant is *obviously dangerous for the infant*, have you ever heard of human trafficking? Kidnapping? Even if you do not care about your sister at all, your spitefulness put your nephew in a dangerous position. \n\nIf you ever have a baby, I hope in your hardest, lowest moment in those first few months, you remember how cold you were to your sister. You may not feel sorry now, but you might then.", "Is there missing info here? Because your attitude comes off like your sister pulls this kind of thing all the time and you're deeply sick of her but it could be you just don't like her. NTA because she definitely included herself on your trip to co-opt your time and you made it clear multiple times you weren't going to help her. \n\n>We made it there but later mom asked if she really raised me to be so cold towards my sister.\n\nAdults involving their parents in personal conflicts with siblings piss me off as does parents trying the I didn't raise you to whatever tact. So that probably effects my judgement here.", "ESH - yes, she could have waited for another time to take a trip if you really didn't want to be around her that badly, but who acts the way you do? You are the one acting like a child and a major ah", "NTA but definitely an ass. I get it your boundaries were crossed but sheeesh. A little empathy goes a long way. I\u2019d watch a complete strangers kid at the airport for an hour if it meant the poor exhausted mother can catch some shut eye. Not sure what your relationship is like with your sister but your little nephew didnt do anything to deserve such callousness from his aunt just for existing.", "NTA \n\nYou planned to travel alone. It doesn't matter why. You don't have to like your sister or her child.\n\nYou made it clear in advance that you didn't want baby duty. I don't think you could have made it any more clear. She probably didn't travel alone with the baby for the past 5 months because she was afraid to. \n\nShe planned on you being her backup and thought she could make you take care of the baby. Idk why she was so surprised when you said no. \n\nI wouldn't have behaved like you, but this isn't about me. I don't see where you did anything wrong.", "YTA. I can\u2019t imagine having this level of hate and vindictiveness for anyone let alone my sister. Delayed flights and sleep deprivation are exceptional circumstances. She didn\u2019t ask you to hold the baby while she got a latte. She was literally awake for 24+ hours and worried about her medical health/ the baby\u2019s safety. You can\u2019t just sleep with the baby on the floor in the airport. If I was your sister I would never talk to you again. I get some people hate kids, but like damn", "NTA. \n\nTo recap Rae: \n\n- purposefully waited until you planned a trip to take hers so she could use you for a babysitter \n\n- wanted you to stay awake and watch her child so she could sleep \n\n- went back on her word not to force you to babysit \n\n- cried to mommy when you didn\u2019t let yourself be manipulated \n\nRae sounds more childish and exhausting to deal with than her toddler. You\u2019re the one who deserved an apology.", "You might not be THE AH but you definitely seem like AN AH.", "Your whole post is dripping with hostility. YTA. You claim to love your sister, but we don\u2019t treat people we love this way. Obviously you have no idea how it works to have kids since you say \u201che\u2019s like 5 months old she had plenty of time for her to take him if it was that important\u201d. 5 months isn\u2019t that old and seems to be an appropriate age for him to have him his 1st flight to see family.", "INFO: Why are you so nasty to your sister?\n\nIt sounds like you hate her.", "NTA, like you said, she put herself in this situation and agreed to leave you alone.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nCould you have shown compassion by taking care of your nephew for an hour or two so your sister could sleep? Obviously, yes. Should you have shown such compassion, if you weren't making a point, sure.\n\nYou were making a point, though. You made it clear you did not want your sister tagging along on this particular trip, and if she insisted you would accept no responsibility for the care of her infant. She agreed to these terms. She reneged on that agreement by asking you to hold the baby while she slept. Running to mommy to validate her failure to abide by the rules shows a lack of maturity.", "NTA She imposed on your trip and you set boundaries with her before starting out. It sounds like there\u2019s so much more to this story including the sister expecting to get her way. It doesn\u2019t matter how much care for family, if you let them violate your boundaries you\u2019re asking for long term trouble.", "Technically NTA, but it seems like there are deeper issues here than just the trip.", "NTA piss poor planning on her part is her own fault. She should have planned for all worst case scenarios when traveling with a kid. Just bc she didn't does not mean you have to pick up the slack for her.", "I'm going with nta.\n\n The way it sounded to me was that Rae wanted them to meet her son. Meaning it hasn't happened yet. If any of them care,  the meeting would've already happened. I would be pissed if my parents didn't take the time to meet their grandchild. It's easier for older people to travel but lap children fly free. They are using you for a free babysitter and sisters keeper. I would call them out on their bs, too.", "NTA", "Nta op wanted to go alone. The sister invited themselves along. When op refused they got their mom to apply pressure. Op said from the beginning she wasn't babysitting or helping. It's hard to travel with a baby something op didn't want to do. The sister is responsible for herself and her kiddo. I love all my sisters but sometimes just no. It's ok to not include everyone in your plans.", "YTA, and I know others have asked, but to get ot off my chest- what the fuck is your problem? You sound so hateful and uncaring, it's hard to imagine someone so unpleasant! If you don't like kids or whatever, fine! But holy shit! Telling ur sister to just pretend you're not there? Refusing to just hold your nephew? Just your language in general! Do you need to get laid? Do you need to scream at the sky? Rae sounds like she just wanted a nice trip to see your parents with her sister, but of my sister talked to me like you did, Idk what I would even do. Go pet a puppy. Or do you hate those too?", "NTA. You told your sister up front that you weren\u2019t going to help her with her kid. She decided to interject herself into your trip anyway.", "NTA, I believe you should NEVER invite yourself even if it's with your own family. She invited herself because she didn't want to deal with her baby alone. Where dad? Why didn't he go and help her? Not your responsibility.", "YTA. You seem like a horrible human being on many levels!", "That\u2019s a whole lot of words to just say you hate your sister.\n\nESH because your sister insisted on making your trip a family trip when you obviously didn\u2019t want that and she expected you to help with her baby when you said you wouldn\u2019t, but you come off as just generally hateful and miserable.", "Normally when I read a post about somebody forcing their way into somebody else's plans I'd say NTA However this whole post reeks of \"Already mad and just wants to take it out on somebody'\n\n\"I might be willing to just apologize to shut her up if people say I\u2019m the AH.\"\n\nYou're not even making this post because you genuinely want to understand if you were being an AH or not you just want to find a way to 'Shut her up'\n\nWell here's your answer YOUR THE A\\*\\*HOLE!", "wow nta \ud83d\udc40 i really don\u2019t like how people bring this whole you\u2019re not nice to her/ you don\u2019t love her or her kid into this, who cares. if you obviously feel some type of way about her, then that\u2019s the all the more reason for her NOT to even try it. she needed to figure out what to do on her own. she knew you didn\u2019t want to be involved and she should\u2019ve worked something out. if someone says no, that means no. she was trying to push her luck.", "NTA.

Your whole posts screams of anger towards your sister. It's so glaring to see in your post. Think the issues are way beyond just watching out for your nephew. It really wouldn't hurt you to just help her watch your nephew. It was an emergency because no one can foresee a flight delay and there's no one she can call or ask for help from.

Neither of you could\u2019ve known the flight would be delayed. I\u2019m sure if she had another option other than asking you to watch the baby while she slept she would\u2019ve taken it.

Our parents own a vacation home. When I moved out they decided to move there permanently. \n\nThey\u2019ve only been back once so I recently decided to visit them. \n\nMom and Rae were talking and my plans came up. She called and asked why I didn\u2019t tell her I was planning to go to Cali. I said it had nothing to do with her so why would I have to tell her anything. \n\nShe said it made no sense for us to do separate trips when we could just go together. I said she\u2019s acting extremely entitled to something she had no parts in and I\u2019m not obligated to include her in every plan I make. She said she just wants our parents to meet her son. I said he\u2019s like 5 months you had plenty of time to take him if it was important.\n\nThen she cried to mom. Ma said it was a good idea. I said if Rae cared so much she would\u2019ve planned to see them on her own. She told me she really needs this. \n\nI told Rae if she comes she can\u2019t ask me for shit I\u2019m not helping with her kid act like I\u2019m not even there. She agreed. \n\nThe day came and our connecting flight was delayed so we had to stay the night. I was trying to fall asleep. She asked me if I was really going to sleep. I was annoyed. I said \u201cIf you leave me tf alone.\u201d \n\nLater she asked me to watch the baby. I said just hold him and go to sleep. She was scared someone would snatch him while she slept. I said she sounds fkn crazy and no one wants her kid. She said she was exhausted and had been drinking energy drinks all night but she was crashing and tried to put him in my arms again. I said \u201cThis is exactly why you should\u2019ve just stayed tf at home. I told you from jump I\u2019m not doing shit. You already forced your way here now you\u2019re just gonna have to figure it out.\u201d She said \u201cSeriously? I\u2019m fkn exhausted I can barely even keep my eyes open\u201c I said \u201cThen go to sleep\u201c and closed my eyes. She knew what the terms were.\n\nWe made it there but later mom asked if she really raised me to be so cold towards my sister. She told me she had broken down and had a mental meltdown. I said I love my sister but she should grow up and stop being so dramatic about a situation she put herself in. She said it wouldn\u2019t have hurt to help her even just a little. I told her I didn\u2019t help her make the baby and she should\u2019ve known something could go wrong when traveling. \n\nWe got back a week ago and haven\u2019t spoken to each other at all but she texted me today how hurt she was and she feels like I don\u2019t care about her or my nephew at all. I told her she knew what she was getting into when she begged to come and imposed on my trip. She said she thought I would\u2019ve changed my mind when I realized we would have to sleep in the airport and that she would\u2019ve done it for me. I said \u201cYour kid. You\u2019re responsibility.\u201d I might be willing to just apologize to shut her up if people say I\u2019m the AH.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Just based on that, people would see OP as the AH. But add in something like, for example, maybe the sister was a GC growing up and OP was a SG, then a kernal of sympathy starts to grow. General experiences that usual occur in this type of dynamic happen as they grow, leading OP having to be very firm in expressing and keeping to boundaries, or risk being walked all over by family members.\n\nI don't really have a judgement to give here, I'd prefer to know more of how OP and her sister grew up together to see if her actions were understandable given the circumstances or not.", "I\u2019d treat any random stranger better than OP does her sister.

In fact, I wouldn\u2019t even want to have a relationship with someone I felt that way about.

And I've traveled with her and her kids on planes and in cars. She never forced me to help, but of course i offered to make it easier for her.\n\nYour sister had a baby mere months ago. And that flight from NY to CA is LONG, and it would have been very scary and difficult for her to travel alone with the infant, especially before 5 months.

Thanks for helping me realize what an amazing sibling I have.\n\nIt's not even about saying no to helping. It's literally about how awful your responses are. No one is obligated to helping out with someone else's child but there are so many different ways you could have said no.", "YTA. \n\nI never babysit for anyone ever. I find kids overbearing. That being said no matter how entitled or spoiled you think your sister is the situation of your travel changed.  I have 4 siblings and in general we are all quite cold and distant. We still find the time to visit our parents and to let each other know. From the way your post is written I doubt you like your sister enough to ever let her know. Sometimes we also visit alone because we want quality time. I think feeling frustrated is justified but does that excuse you being so inflexible in high stress changing situation. In so far as you stated she only ask for your help after you both were put in a stressful situation. If you\u2019re tired imagine how your sister with the newborn felt. You completely disregarded her justified anxieties about sleeping with her newborn in the airport. Furthermore I highly doubt your sister arranged for you to miss your connecting flight this whole thing reads like you hate your sister and are just plain inconsiderate. No. I also find it strange that you automatically assumed she wanted a babysitter. Has she forced you to babysit at any other time.? She\u2019s going to visit the grandparents and there goes two babysitters guaranteed. Why would she need you there as well. Maybe she actually wanted to visit as a family because you can\u2019t actually know. You\u2019re just making assumptions. The other thing I find really weird is you insisting she could have gone earlier. She has a 5 month old and most likely she couldn\u2019t be on plane for several weeks and then she had a newborn. Most people don\u2019t take literally fresh out the oven babies on planes. Lastly I want to add that I saw that your sister may have been irresponsible in the past and irresponsible siblings are a thing I\u2019ve dealt with in my own life. But I wouldn\u2019t risk my niece or nephew\u2019s safety over a grudge against my sibling. At 23 and 25 you\u2019re both still really young.

And I\u2019m a stranger, not a supposedly loving sister. I can understand that you felt corralled into her company but you weren\u2019t very kind when something unforeseen happened. And because it was unforeseen and all she had originally wanted was your company and probably morale support, YTA.", "YTA.  Based on how you described all of this going on, you really are very cold.  You didn\u2019t provide a reasonable explanation for why you were immediately so harsh towards your sister.", "Even though you very adamantly told her you would NOT HELP I kind of feel you were just rubbing that fact into her. Sometimes you just have to suck it up and be a decent human being. YTA!  And I have a feeling that you hate your sister, so there\u2019s more to this story.", "In technicality were you obligated? No. But morally or whatever you\u2019re absolutely TA. Serious question, do you hate your sister? Because that\u2019s the vibe I was getting from the very first paragraph about her. I\u2019m not close with my siblings, but if I was going to visit my parents I would definitely let them know in case they wanted to go too. It\u2019s nice to all be together when we can, so why not at least let them know my plans? \n\nAnd as far as the airport delays, she\u2019s absolutely right about not falling asleep with a child in an airport. I would not feel comfortable at all doing that. You hear these awful stories about sex trafficking all the time. And in an airport?? That baby could end up with absolutely anyone from anywhere. I would legitimately die for my nephews. Without a second thought (and this is as someone who is child free and plans to stay that way). The fact that you weren\u2019t willing to just keep an eye on him at let your sister sleep for an hour or two after it sounds like she had already done anything she could to try to stay awake is so selfish. \n\nWere you obligated to do anything? No. But the way you acted and speak of your sister makes you sound heartless and like an awful sibling to have. \n\nDon\u2019t apologize to her if you don\u2019t mean it.

I can't believe people like you exist", "YTA - You might have been right about everything you said, but that does not mean you aren't an asshole in this situation. You are obviously clueless about child safety. Your sister should NOT sleep with the baby in her arms, that is a recipe for disaster.

Instead, you chose to be an asshole, and tried to explain it off.", "I don't have kids, so I was prepared to be sympathetic.

If I planned a trip to see my parents and he begged to tag along and agreed to my stipulations, then proceeded to break those boundaries, I'd be pissed, too. \n\nWith that said, you are being an asshole. You could have watched the baby for an hour or two. There's not much else to do in an airport. ESH.", "SHE should grow up? Babe, YOU need to grow up. You sound like an angry, spoiled teenager.", "You don't sound like you love or even like your sister.

Not wanting anything to do with your sister or nephew is your choice, but then stick by them. Don't do the trip with her no matter what. Don't give her the flight info, don't car pool... if she wants to crash the trip then she can look for all the information and find it herself, get there herself. Be like strangers running into eachother on the bus.

If you are truly not willing to do do ANYTHING (a flight delay is NOT your sister's fault by the way and qualifies as extenuating circumstances) then honestly don't talk to her, don't be near her, move on with your life. The amount of hate and callousness you have is appalling. \n\nEven if this is a scenario where your sister is an entitled jerk and this was your last straw and she deserved it on some level.... don't let yourself become that bitter, angry and hurtful of a person.

They don't want to give themselves an excuse or make someone automatically hate their sibling.", "When do people get to say they don\u2019t want to do something\u2026.. and not be forced to do that exact thing they stated so clearly they did not want to do?\n\nNO MEANS NO\u2026..\n\nAnd when are people going to stop using emotional expectations to stomp on very clear, very reasonable boundaries?\n\nShe should \u201cfeel\u201d responsible for her sister and the nephew because if not she\u2019s a \u201ccold\u201d person? \n\nCold being a negative connotation\u2026.\n\nConnotations are the emotional attachment to a word, you\u2019re quite literally seeking to emotionally manipulate this person into \u201cfeeling\u201d responsible for outcomes she had no part in\u2026.. a kid is an outcome of a choice and she certainly didn\u2019t choose it.\n\nI don\u2019t like enablers\u2026 they\u2019re so righteously outraged", "Uhm... If none of this screams \"no\" to you, I wonder what will in this situation? What the sister got was a reaction. She was not told of the trip to begin with, and when she created drama, she was told off again. What in \"NOT helping with your kid\" not a hard \"no\"? As an adult when someone does not inform you of their plans, it means they didn't want you involved. If she cannot get a clue at 25, good luck to the kid.", "She literally said \"I'm not helping with your kid\". How is that not a hard no???", "I'm diagnosed with ASD and I'd still be able to tell clear as day that thats a hard no", "You do realize that pretty much every airport has a hotel attached to it, right? If that one was full, I've never flown to a single location where there aren't a number of hotels within a five minute drive. The sister could have easily booked a hotel room for herself and the baby, but she chose not to do so. That isn't the OP's fault. The sister's lack of planning is not the OP's emergency.", "That\u2019s a really good point about OP being able to do different things with her parents if her sister wasn\u2019t there with a new baby.  There are a lot of places and things you cannot do with a five month old.  Perhaps this is why OP is so hostile and angry.", "Yeah it\u2019s not your obligation for sure but it does make you an asshole. I straight up don\u2019t like children but in an emergency I would never deny my family help.", "Yeah but then you\u2019re an asshole. Unless they regularly take advantage of you.", "The way OP reacted, I'm suspecting that it's not the first time sister has pushed to get her way and it's fallen on OP to carry the can", "What if Rae had been traveling alone? She would have had to figure something out for herself and her baby. She would have had to either stay awake all night or find a safe way to sleep with the baby.\n\nWhich is why she didn't want to travel there on her own, she didn't want to be responsible 100% of the time, she wanted someone else to be around so she could dump the responsibility of the baby on them if she wanted to do something else.\n\nWhich is why OP never wanted her to join in, because OP wanted 0 responsibility for a baby at all times. And OP obviously knew that Rae was going to try and dump the responsibility on her, which is why she warned her ahead of time that it wasn't happening.", "I love my sister; but I  spent 4 days at home over winter break and was absolutely spent being in the same house as her 1 year old and I wasn't even asked to perform tasks for him. I would be hard pressed to call any trip with him a vacation.", "Yeah If someone talked to me the way OP talked to sister I would assume that they didn't like me, didn't want to be around me, and would not spit on me if I was on fire.", "But the sister could have just stayed home, instead of last minute hijacking OP's trip. It's not like OP agreed to have her come, or was anything but against the idea from start to finish. OP didn't want or need to deal with sister or baby on this trip in any way, shape, or form. Ok was extremely clear that if sister horned her way into this trip where she wasn't wanted, then OP was not going to provide any services and sister could treat it as traveling alone. \n\nOk just wanted a nice relaxing trip. Sister is a giant pathetic AH.", "Right? I can't relate to any of this at all. My sisters and I would never.", "Why should Rae get to sleep if OP can\u2019t? It\u2019s Rae\u2019s kid, so why should OP be the one sacrificing?", "The woman had a baby with her, she had no business sleeping in an airport.  I wouldn't do that with my dog, I sure as fuck wouldn't do it with a 5 month old baby.  The sister needs to stop acting like she can through caution to the wind, OP is not responsible for her sister's lack of responsibility.", "So you\u2019re the one who GETS favors, not asks for them, got it", "It's sad, but it has to be done when one family member ignores boundaries and tries to manipulate the others into getting their way.", "i read \u201clater\u201d and assumed OP had already taken a nap/gotten sleep. if that wasn\u2019t the case, then yeah i get it.", "The sister can\u2019t take a hint, it would seem.", "Her sister had many choices. She could have tried many options to make sure she got to sleep while her baby was safe. \n\nThe choice she MADE, was to ask OP to do the one thing OP made clear wasn\u2019t on the table. \nI can\u2019t imagine traveling with my 5-month old and just \u201cwinging it\u201d and expecting to guilt-rely on the one other adult that made it clear I wasn\u2019t to rely on them.", "Yeah it is when you don't have a direct flight . And a delay is always possible in the public transportation which flying is", "Also in an emergency, you can just skip one night of sleep.\n\nSure, it isn't fun but if you need to, you can do it.\n\nI've done it before, I will probably need to do it again, many of us have skipped at least one night in their life.\n\nThe boundaries where set and agreed up on, sure you can ask, but no still means no.", "No travel before vaccinations, saving money to afford trip, wanting to have a companion while traveling(not meaning babysitter) ALL are  legitimate reasons why a mother of a 5 month old might not have flown across the country yet.", "Don't you think those are based on a lifetime's experiences with her sister manipulating her and her parents?", "Yep you\u2019re not wrong", "Ah but OP already made it clear and the sister accepted that OP was not going to be involved with the travel then the sister admitted that she was lying. She tried to gaslight OP and blew up in her face. Not everyone is good at looking after children but yet people with kids expect them to step in because they need a break no just no it\u2019s hard and we all know it\u2019s hard but just expecting her to do it because they\u2019re sisters is just unfair and I am not sorry is unacceptable.", "According to OP's wording it wasn't actually a lie. She didn't expect help until an extenuating circumstance that was going to add multiple hours on the trip cropped up. That's not going back on your word. Thats thinking that a big change in circumstances might lead to a little more compassion."]}
