Our parents own a vacation home. When I moved out they decided to move there permanently. \n\nThey\u2019ve only been back once so I recently decided to visit them. \n\nMom and Rae were talking and my plans came up. She called and asked why I didn\u2019t tell her I was planning to go to Cali. I said it had nothing to do with her so why would I have to tell her anything. \n\nShe said it made no sense for us to do separate trips when we could just go together. I said she\u2019s acting extremely entitled to something she had no parts in and I\u2019m not obligated to include her in every plan I make. She said she just wants our parents to meet her son. I said he\u2019s like 5 months you had plenty of time to take him if it was important.\n\nThen she cried to mom. Ma said it was a good idea. I said if Rae cared so much she would\u2019ve planned to see them on her own. She told me she really needs this. \n\nI told Rae if she comes she can\u2019t ask me for shit I\u2019m not helping with her kid act like I\u2019m not even there. She agreed. \n\nThe day came and our connecting flight was delayed so we had to stay the night. I was trying to fall asleep. She asked me if I was really going to sleep. I was annoyed. I said \u201cIf you leave me tf alone.\u201d \n\nLater she asked me to watch the baby. I said just hold him and go to sleep. She was scared someone would snatch him while she slept. I said she sounds fkn crazy and no one wants her kid. She said she was exhausted and had been drinking energy drinks all night but she was crashing and tried to put him in my arms again. I said \u201cThis is exactly why you should\u2019ve just stayed tf at home. I told you from jump I\u2019m not doing shit. You already forced your way here now you\u2019re just gonna have to figure it out.\u201d She said \u201cSeriously? I\u2019m fkn exhausted I can barely even keep my eyes open\u201c I said \u201cThen go to sleep\u201c and closed my eyes. She knew what the terms were.\n\nWe made it there but later mom asked if she really raised me to be so cold towards my sister. She told me she had broken down and had a mental meltdown. I said I love my sister but she should grow up and stop being so dramatic about a situation she put herself in. She said it wouldn\u2019t have hurt to help her even just a little. I told her I didn\u2019t help her make the baby and she should\u2019ve known something could go wrong when traveling. \n\nWe got back a week ago and haven\u2019t spoken to each other at all but she texted me today how hurt she was and she feels like I don\u2019t care about her or my nephew at all. I told her she knew what she was getting into when she begged to come and imposed on my trip. She said she thought I would\u2019ve changed my mind when I realized we would have to sleep in the airport and that she would\u2019ve done it for me. I said \u201cYour kid. You\u2019re responsibility.\u201d I might be willing to just apologize to shut her up if people say I\u2019m the AH.", "created_utc": 1679177297, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11v2eud/aita_for_not_helping_my_sister_watch_my_nephew/", "score": 594, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or of you two not getting on for other reasons?\n\nOn the one hand, you did set your boundaries and your sister pushed past them (or tried to, anyway).  She does suck for that.\n\nOn the other hand, the circumstances were such that I'd expect a loving family member to put previous conversations aside and help out for the sake of the innocent infant they should surely love.  You do come across as cold in that regard.\n\nBut, if this is just the last straw after years of your sister trampling all over your clearly defined boundaries then I can understand that and could see why you were reluctant to travel with her in the first place.\n\nWith the current information available, I'm going with ESH (except the baby).", "You can be technically correct and still be morally wrong. ESH. Your sister for latching on to your trip and forcing you into the situation in the first place. And you for the absolute callousness with which you regard your sister and nephew. In extenuating circumstances like a flight delay, all it needs is a LITTLE give and take to make everyone's experience a LOT easier.\n\nI would never wish for anyone to have you as a relative. You seem to treat relationships as purely rules-based zero sum games. What an awful awful way to live, let's hope you never find yourself in a situation where you need someone else's help.", "ESH. Your sister did sound a bit entitled but fucking hell you sound like an absolute peach. There are several ways to handle the shit life throws at you, you chose poorly.", "You are not obligated to include your sister in your travel plans although I do think that, in theory, it sounds like a nice idea to visit your parents together. Nothing wrong with a little family get together. \n\nIn reality though, you sound terribly cold like your mother said. Do you hate your sister? Do you hate your nephew? You sound like you do. It wouldn't kill you to be a tiny bit helpful, especially in extenuating circumstances. What's your problem? \n\nIf that's how you were going to act, your answer should have been a hard no when your sister asked to tag along. Had she known that's how you were going to act, I'm certain she wouldn't have asked. You took a great opportunity to spend quality time with your sister and her sweet baby and shat all over it.\n\nYTA", "A technical NTA, but you do appear to be a rather unpleasant type.", "This whole story makes no sense.  Why haven\u2019t the grandparents come to visit?  They could afford two homes but not one trip back to the place they used to live to see their new grand baby?\n\nYour flight was delayed overnight in an airport but they didn\u2019t send you to a hotel.\n\nAnd sister is traveling with a 5 month old but has no stroller to let baby sleep in and also doesn\u2019t just spread out a blanket on the floor.\n\nOP sounds weirdly cold and completely detached, but sister and mom sound lazy and whiny.  They all sound horrible.", "NTA. She wormed her way into your trip with the agreement that you would not be babysitting. Then she proceeded to forget that agreement and try to get you to babysit. You are not obligated to watch a kid that is not yours. \n\nI will give the benefit of the doubt and say that it does sound like you resent your sister for having a baby, or maybe the circumstances she had the baby in.", "NTA you said right from start you didn't want to take care of the baby. She tried to guilt you into it. As the youngest of 4 kids I was always stuck taking care of my nieces. I had no choice. I'd get in shit if I didn't. Good on you for sticking to your guns!", "NTA. OP said she wanted to visit on her own. Sis wants to bring the baby, who her mom has not met.  Now OP\u2019s trip is going to be about the new baby and sis being an overwhelmed mom. OP was on the same trip - why is sis more entitled to sleep than OP is?  I think sis and mom were both the AH on this one.", "YTA. Your entire post reeks of being a mean-spirited and terrible sister & aunt.", "NTA\nSis already knew where you stood. She hitched onto your trip and then expected you to take care of her child, that\u2019s a no.\nYes you can love people dearly and still not have to do anything you aren\u2019t comfortable with. I\u2019m so tired of, \u201cbut they are family.\u201d\nNo one is responsible for your child but you.", "NTA.  OP had made her plans, and her biggest mistake was not sticking to her \u201cnope.\u201d  If you\u2019re not into babies, it\u2019s best to stay away from them.  The whole trip will revolve around the baby.  And let\u2019s not pretend delays are a surprise in cross country flights.  Sister presumably has a partner of some sort and that\u2019s who should be accompanying her to her parents\u2019 home.", "NTA, you didn\u2019t want her to come on the trip, and you told her you wouldn\u2019t babysit. You wanted a solo trip to visit your parents, her expectations are unreasonable since you guys are obviously not that close, and that\u2019s okay. Yes you could have been nicer, but it\u2019s on her to put herself in a situation where she wasn\u2019t wanted, also with significant delays you guys could have required for a hotel room if she was too exhausted.", "Technically NTA because you set your conditions and stuck to them but damn if I was your sister I would really be questioning whether I wanted you in my life or not. They way you talk to her and about her is really awful. it doesn\u2019t seem like you want her in your life either. \n\nAlso, baby snatching is a very real and dangerous possibility. So you were technically in your right to say no, this was a situation where a fraction of kindness and empathy would have went a long way.", "YTA. You don't sound like a very nice person. You obviously hate your sister and her child. You hate them so much you were willing to put a baby in an unsafe situation. Your sister could have fallen asleep with him and dropped him. You said no one wants her child but kidnappings happen all of the time. Trafficking is an issue and its especially easy with babies. \n\nIdk why you hate her so much but maybe just stay away from them.", "ESH. \nYour sister for hijacking your trip.\nYou way more so for being cold AF. \n\nYour sister has a new baby and her husband is gone a lot on an oil rig. Her baby is 5 months old and your parents haven\u2019t met him, which means your mom hasn\u2019t been there to help her adjust to new motherhood. You *obviously* haven\u2019t been a support to her during this time by the tone of this post. She probably heard you were going to see your parents, realized she had an opportunity to travel with another adult in case of emergency, and desperately needed some kind of human contact and support. Reading this makes me feel so bad for your sister. Becoming a mom alters your entire reality. Doing it with an incredible support system was hard as fuck, and your sister sounds like she has a really shitty one. \n\nOf course she said she wouldn\u2019t make you help with her son, because I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t plan to. Flying from NYC to CA, I\u2019m sure she figured she\u2019d be fine. Extenuating circumstances created a situation in which any rational adult would assist their loved one, if only for the well-being of the child and not because of..idk, empathy? Which you clearly have none of. \n\nCaring for an infant with no sleep is *dangerous for the infant.* Sleeping while holding an infant is *dangerous for the infant.* Both adults sleeping in the middle of an airport with no one watching the infant is *obviously dangerous for the infant*, have you ever heard of human trafficking? Kidnapping? Even if you do not care about your sister at all, your spitefulness put your nephew in a dangerous position. \n\nIf you ever have a baby, I hope in your hardest, lowest moment in those first few months, you remember how cold you were to your sister. You may not feel sorry now, but you might then.", "Is there missing info here? Because your attitude comes off like your sister pulls this kind of thing all the time and you're deeply sick of her but it could be you just don't like her. NTA because she definitely included herself on your trip to co-opt your time and you made it clear multiple times you weren't going to help her. \n\n>We made it there but later mom asked if she really raised me to be so cold towards my sister.\n\nAdults involving their parents in personal conflicts with siblings piss me off as does parents trying the I didn't raise you to whatever tact. So that probably effects my judgement here.", "ESH - yes, she could have waited for another time to take a trip if you really didn't want to be around her that badly, but who acts the way you do? You are the one acting like a child and a major ah", "NTA but definitely an ass. I get it your boundaries were crossed but sheeesh. A little empathy goes a long way. I\u2019d watch a complete strangers kid at the airport for an hour if it meant the poor exhausted mother can catch some shut eye. Not sure what your relationship is like with your sister but your little nephew didnt do anything to deserve such callousness from his aunt just for existing.", "NTA \n\nYou planned to travel alone. It doesn't matter why. You don't have to like your sister or her child.\n\nYou made it clear in advance that you didn't want baby duty. I don't think you could have made it any more clear. She probably didn't travel alone with the baby for the past 5 months because she was afraid to. \n\nShe planned on you being her backup and thought she could make you take care of the baby. Idk why she was so surprised when you said no. \n\nI wouldn't have behaved like you, but this isn't about me. I don't see where you did anything wrong.", "YTA. I can\u2019t imagine having this level of hate and vindictiveness for anyone let alone my sister. Delayed flights and sleep deprivation are exceptional circumstances. She didn\u2019t ask you to hold the baby while she got a latte. She was literally awake for 24+ hours and worried about her medical health/ the baby\u2019s safety. You can\u2019t just sleep with the baby on the floor in the airport. If I was your sister I would never talk to you again. I get some people hate kids, but like damn", "NTA. \n\nTo recap Rae: \n\n- purposefully waited until you planned a trip to take hers so she could use you for a babysitter \n\n- wanted you to stay awake and watch her child so she could sleep \n\n- went back on her word not to force you to babysit \n\n- cried to mommy when you didn\u2019t let yourself be manipulated \n\nRae sounds more childish and exhausting to deal with than her toddler. You\u2019re the one who deserved an apology.", "You might not be THE AH but you definitely seem like AN AH.", "Your whole post is dripping with hostility. YTA. You claim to love your sister, but we don\u2019t treat people we love this way. Obviously you have no idea how it works to have kids since you say \u201che\u2019s like 5 months old she had plenty of time for her to take him if it was that important\u201d. 5 months isn\u2019t that old and seems to be an appropriate age for him to have him his 1st flight to see family.", "INFO: Why are you so nasty to your sister?\n\nIt sounds like you hate her.", "NTA, like you said, she put herself in this situation and agreed to leave you alone.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nCould you have shown compassion by taking care of your nephew for an hour or two so your sister could sleep? Obviously, yes. Should you have shown such compassion, if you weren't making a point, sure.\n\nYou were making a point, though. You made it clear you did not want your sister tagging along on this particular trip, and if she insisted you would accept no responsibility for the care of her infant. She agreed to these terms. She reneged on that agreement by asking you to hold the baby while she slept. Running to mommy to validate her failure to abide by the rules shows a lack of maturity.", "NTA She imposed on your trip and you set boundaries with her before starting out. It sounds like there\u2019s so much more to this story including the sister expecting to get her way. It doesn\u2019t matter how much care for family, if you let them violate your boundaries you\u2019re asking for long term trouble.", "Technically NTA, but it seems like there are deeper issues here than just the trip.", "NTA piss poor planning on her part is her own fault. She should have planned for all worst case scenarios when traveling with a kid. Just bc she didn't does not mean you have to pick up the slack for her.", "I'm going with nta.\n\n The way it sounded to me was that Rae wanted them to meet her son. Meaning it hasn't happened yet. If any of them care,  the meeting would've already happened. I would be pissed if my parents didn't take the time to meet their grandchild. It's easier for older people to travel but lap children fly free. They are using you for a free babysitter and sisters keeper. I would call them out on their bs, too.", "NTA", "Nta op wanted to go alone. The sister invited themselves along. When op refused they got their mom to apply pressure. Op said from the beginning she wasn't babysitting or helping. It's hard to travel with a baby something op didn't want to do. The sister is responsible for herself and her kiddo. I love all my sisters but sometimes just no. It's ok to not include everyone in your plans.", "YTA, and I know others have asked, but to get ot off my chest- what the fuck is your problem? You sound so hateful and uncaring, it's hard to imagine someone so unpleasant! If you don't like kids or whatever, fine! But holy shit! Telling ur sister to just pretend you're not there? Refusing to just hold your nephew? Just your language in general! Do you need to get laid? Do you need to scream at the sky? Rae sounds like she just wanted a nice trip to see your parents with her sister, but of my sister talked to me like you did, Idk what I would even do. Go pet a puppy. Or do you hate those too?", "NTA. You told your sister up front that you weren\u2019t going to help her with her kid. She decided to interject herself into your trip anyway.", "NTA, I believe you should NEVER invite yourself even if it's with your own family. She invited herself because she didn't want to deal with her baby alone. Where dad? Why didn't he go and help her? Not your responsibility.", "YTA. You seem like a horrible human being on many levels!", "That\u2019s a whole lot of words to just say you hate your sister.\n\nESH because your sister insisted on making your trip a family trip when you obviously didn\u2019t want that and she expected you to help with her baby when you said you wouldn\u2019t, but you come off as just generally hateful and miserable.", "Normally when I read a post about somebody forcing their way into somebody else's plans I'd say NTA However this whole post reeks of \"Already mad and just wants to take it out on somebody'\n\n\"I might be willing to just apologize to shut her up if people say I\u2019m the AH.\"\n\nYou're not even making this post because you genuinely want to understand if you were being an AH or not you just want to find a way to 'Shut her up'\n\nWell here's your answer YOUR THE A\\*\\*HOLE!", "wow nta \ud83d\udc40 i really don\u2019t like how people bring this whole you\u2019re not nice to her/ you don\u2019t love her or her kid into this, who cares. if you obviously feel some type of way about her, then that\u2019s the all the more reason for her NOT to even try it. she needed to figure out what to do on her own. she knew you didn\u2019t want to be involved and she should\u2019ve worked something out. if someone says no, that means no. she was trying to push her luck.", "NTA.

Your whole posts screams of anger towards your sister. It's so glaring to see in your post. Think the issues are way beyond just watching out for your nephew. It really wouldn't hurt you to just help her watch your nephew. It was an emergency because no one can foresee a flight delay and there's no one she can call or ask for help from.

Neither of you could\u2019ve known the flight would be delayed. I\u2019m sure if she had another option other than asking you to watch the baby while she slept she would\u2019ve taken it.

Our parents own a vacation home. When I moved out they decided to move there permanently. \n\nThey\u2019ve only been back once so I recently decided to visit them. \n\nMom and Rae were talking and my plans came up. She called and asked why I didn\u2019t tell her I was planning to go to Cali. I said it had nothing to do with her so why would I have to tell her anything. \n\nShe said it made no sense for us to do separate trips when we could just go together. I said she\u2019s acting extremely entitled to something she had no parts in and I\u2019m not obligated to include her in every plan I make. She said she just wants our parents to meet her son. I said he\u2019s like 5 months you had plenty of time to take him if it was important.\n\nThen she cried to mom. Ma said it was a good idea. I said if Rae cared so much she would\u2019ve planned to see them on her own. She told me she really needs this. \n\nI told Rae if she comes she can\u2019t ask me for shit I\u2019m not helping with her kid act like I\u2019m not even there. She agreed. \n\nThe day came and our connecting flight was delayed so we had to stay the night. I was trying to fall asleep. She asked me if I was really going to sleep. I was annoyed. I said \u201cIf you leave me tf alone.\u201d \n\nLater she asked me to watch the baby. I said just hold him and go to sleep. She was scared someone would snatch him while she slept. I said she sounds fkn crazy and no one wants her kid. She said she was exhausted and had been drinking energy drinks all night but she was crashing and tried to put him in my arms again. I said \u201cThis is exactly why you should\u2019ve just stayed tf at home. I told you from jump I\u2019m not doing shit. You already forced your way here now you\u2019re just gonna have to figure it out.\u201d She said \u201cSeriously? I\u2019m fkn exhausted I can barely even keep my eyes open\u201c I said \u201cThen go to sleep\u201c and closed my eyes. She knew what the terms were.\n\nWe made it there but later mom asked if she really raised me to be so cold towards my sister. She told me she had broken down and had a mental meltdown. I said I love my sister but she should grow up and stop being so dramatic about a situation she put herself in. She said it wouldn\u2019t have hurt to help her even just a little. I told her I didn\u2019t help her make the baby and she should\u2019ve known something could go wrong when traveling. \n\nWe got back a week ago and haven\u2019t spoken to each other at all but she texted me today how hurt she was and she feels like I don\u2019t care about her or my nephew at all. I told her she knew what she was getting into when she begged to come and imposed on my trip. She said she thought I would\u2019ve changed my mind when I realized we would have to sleep in the airport and that she would\u2019ve done it for me. I said \u201cYour kid. You\u2019re responsibility.\u201d I might be willing to just apologize to shut her up if people say I\u2019m the AH.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It definitely sounds like there's more behind it (maybe repeated pressure from the sister to help with the kid? Or, whatever, really there's so many possibilities) or just not really liking her sister? I mean, you can love someone without liking them.", "Alternatively, OP sounds like she's at the end of her rope having had her trip hijacked and knowing that she's staring down the barrel of a baby-fest instead of a lovely quiet break. She sets *one* boundary in place, and entitled sister tries to stomp all over it instead of having an actual plan for what to do with baby in the reasonably foreseeable event of a delay at the airport, and then sulks when OP doesn't crumble.  Rae is obviously the golden child. I feel sorry for OP.", "If it was that big a deal to her she would have planned a trip herself.

OP is NTA", "All travel comes with risk of delay, not sure anyone expects it", "There is this new invention called hotel room.", "She was mainly asked to keep an eye on the baby. Mom was nervous about potential dangers if she fell asleep. It\u2019s her nephew.

There's obviously history here.", "You are NTA. Your sister forced her way in your trip and tried to get you to do things you clearly told her you wouldn\u2019t. She chose to go on the trip. You didn\u2019t even invite her.

Your parents live in CA. It's actually LOGICAL that both visiting your parents would be nice idea.\n\nNo, you don't have to inform your sister of all your plans - or however you phrased it.  She didn't force her way into your trip to the beach or Vegas or some random vacay - you're visiting your parents ffs.   If you REALLY had a healthy relationship with your sister. And loved her like you said, you'd see the difference.\n\nAnd your absolute refusal to help in any way while on layover. Again, those are not the actions of someone who loves their sister and nephew.  It's not like she's said, hey I want to visit my friends while I'm here will you babysit?  THAT would be enforcing your boundary that you set out to her.

I don't want to watch your kid during my vacay, but I i recognize that i can help you for 30 min bc we've got this crazy layover and you're clearly overwhelmed.  \n\nAll my comments are based on you saying you do love them.

A point or two of critical information that haven't been included could be the only difference between one judgement or the other.\n\nOn the surface OP does appear to be harsh and unsympatetic toward her sister's troubles and the safety of the baby. Just based on that, people would see OP as the AH. But add in something like, for example, maybe the sister was a GC growing up and OP was a SG, then a kernal of sympathy starts to grow. General experiences that usual occur in this type of dynamic happen as they grow, leading OP having to be very firm in expressing and keeping to boundaries, or risk being walked all over by family members.\n\nI don't really have a judgement to give here, I'd prefer to know more of how OP and her sister grew up together to see if her actions were understandable given the circumstances or not.", "I\u2019d treat any random stranger better than OP does her sister.

It\u2019s not rude for sister to ask, she shouldn\u2019t have pressed but OP did say yes. If she seriously didn\u2019t want the intrusion just decline FFS.", "Travel is fraught with issues and potential delays. Sister should have known this and factored it into her plans. She didnt and she just assumed that OP would change her mind because of the circumstance.  \n\n\nThere was perhaps a more diplomatic manner in handling it however OP is NTA.", "Lmaoooo the fact that you think that\u2019s even a possibility is hilarious. I should be written out of a will for not taking care of someone else\u2019s kid when I told them I wouldn\u2019t??", "Lol. Okay.", "Lol", "No neither would I, but equally I would never go on a trip with a kid that I wasnt prepared to assist with because I know that at some point im going to be asked.\n\nHowever given the scenario presented. OP said \"I will under no circumstances help with this kid\". When travelling long delays are to be expected, the sister should have anticipated that this might occur and had a plan in place knowing full well that OP had already said she would not assist at all.\n\nIn the overall situation I think ESH. But in the specific airport delay part, OP is NTA.  \n\n\nETA: Not following someone elses boundaries is being an AH. Its a separate debate as to if the OPs boundaries were unreasonable to start with, but the sister went with her knowing this", "The nonsense that is OP\u2019s sister. Despite agreeing, OP\u2019s sister completely disregarded the clear boundary that OP set prior to traveling.", "I think your beginning point gets to the core of why I find OPs actions so offensive. OP should have never relented on including her in the trip if they were willing to enforce that boundary to this extent. I would never put myself in a travel situation with someone I was capable of watching struggle and would withhold assistance from. In fact, I wouldn\u2019t even want to have a relationship with someone I felt that way about. I would have respected OP if they had just stuck to their initial boundary regarding the trip, but I feel like relenting and making these conditions is really unreasonable and goes into AH territory for me."]}
