Not for some punishment. Making her clean the room was an excellent one. But three weeks grounding in addition is probably over doing it.\n\nGabrielle was clearly very hurt by Isabelle's attack on her gender identity and is convinced that you are letting Isabelle get away something Gabrielle feels she should be punished (note: I think you handled Isabelle very well, but I can understand Gabrielle not seeing it that way.)\n\nShe is not going to spend the next three weeks learning her lesson. Instead she will most likely be stewing in her sense of the injustice of the situation. All of which will feed a growing resentment of Isabelle and probably you as well.  You showed great understanding with Isabelle and handled that part of the equation with wisdom and restraint. It may be a good idea to show a little of that understanding and restraint to Gabrielle as well.", "I know this is not an advice sub, but as someone who was raised right wing and came out as trans later:\nThis is above Reddit's pay grade. This is probably above your pay grade as parents. You need to get professional help, ASAP, because both these kids are at high risk and are only going to keep hurting each other.", "YTA because of the severity of Gabrielle's punishment.\n\nYou're very willing to forgive the fact that Isabelle is damaged by her experiences, but appear not to have considered that Gabrielle is *also* damaged by her experiences as a trans girl. \n\nWhile Gabrielle was obviously the one best positioned to handle the situation without doing something frankly psychotic, the punishment you gave has only reinforced to her that her changed gender identity made her lesser in your eyes. The emotional turmoil of being a teenager and trans is not to be underestimated, as is having a foster sibling in general, much less one who's got a cognitive disability and spouts alt-right nonsense.\n\nYou should have sat down with Gabrielle and explained all the ways that what she did was significantly worse than what Isabelle did, and reiterate again why you haven't engaged in direct punitive action for Isabelle repeating what she's been taught by others. You should have given her the opportunity to learn, grow, and apologize. \n\nShe put Isabelle in real danger as well as further traumatizing her, and Gabrielle absolutely deserves to be punished for that. I'd be horrified that my child acted in such a despicable, petty, vengeful manner if I were you. But you're still managing to send the message that Isabelle is more important than Gabrielle. \n\nYou should have given her a punishment that fit the crime, like writing an essay on media about foster children or indoctrination or something, or made her take on all the dog responsibilities for a few weeks. Cleaning up another child's urine is not an okay punishment in my books, and the grounding won't teach her anything.", "YTA.\n\n3 weeks grounding is overkill, and no child should be expected to clean up another child's urine or feces.", "YTA and failing all of these children. \n\nYou did not do a good job at all explaining why this was a teaching moment for Isabelle and not a time for punishment. You didn't do a good job of showing Isabelle the gravity of her accusations and how hurtful her words were. A single talk and then a rote apology would have been good for if she'd called her sibling a loser or a buttface. It's not cutting it for preparing her for the reality of living with a trans sibling. \n\n\nThis was a huge missed learning opportunity for everyone. One child is left with conflicting explanations about what her worldview should be (and probably leaning towards the one that says she should hate the person who terrorized her), one child feeling vulnerable, ostracized, and like her own family won't stand up for her. \n\nMaking a child clean up another child's pee is awful and you should be ashamed of your lazy parenting.  Where the fuck is your compassion? Kids don't learn it from you saying \"be nice\" they learn it from you showing them *how* to have compassion. The consequences here should have revolved around education and learning to respect and tolerate each other's differences. It shod not have been a \"that's not a nice thing to say \" and then making your other child do your dirty work. That **is** favoring your foster daughter. You're doing her a disservice by coddling her instead of teaching her.", "You handled this very badly. I get that Isabelle is a product of her environment, but Gabrielle needs to feel safe and supported in her home as well. You decided to meet one child's needs at the expense of the other's instead of making sure to meet both.

Yta soon as she spouted that hateful stuff you did right sure explaining why she's wrong. But your neglecting your own child for the foster kid. I saw it several times the foster parent with the \"hero complex\" your kid needed you. Your child probably feels like the only attention she gets is if she acts out or does something big.  She's still only 14 and doesn't have the support from her own family because all your attention is on the foster kid. You failed her by not sitting her down and being there for her one on one. Explaining it to her may not have helped if she already feels your never there for her. Your punishment was wrong. She was wrong too. But she probably feels like you won't stand up for her so she has to do it herself. Making her clean another child's pee and grounding her for 3 weeks when you won't even give her the time of day. She needs her feelings validated, she knows that apology was forced and your made she just won't put up with it. She shouldn't have too your failing your own child and you don't see it.

I just don\u2019t see how you couldn\u2019t have had one big conversation when you found out what she\u2019d been taught. It would\u2019ve saved everyone a lot of heartache.", "YTA. Not for punishing Gabrielle, but making her clean up after what I understand was Isabelle urinating or defecating in the room. Gabrielle was way out of line, but that punishment is not appropriate. Also, Isabelle should be allowed to change, but if comments like these happen again it must come with consequences.", "INFO\n\nIs this the first time Isabelle has expressed anti-trans ideas? Did you have warning about Isabelle's likely reaction?\n\nDid Gabrielle come out to the entire family at once? Both the parents and siblings?", "This is not an appropriate placement. Your children should not suffer because of a foster placement. Gabrielle is not responsible for teaching other kids IN HER OWN HOME to treat her well. You have enough going on, how do you think taking Isabelle is helping anyone?", "YTA but it's not for punishing Gabrielle.\n\n> Isabelle didn\u2019t mean any harm but Gabrielle wouldn\u2019t hear it. She asked if Isabelle was going to be punished and I said no because she didn\u2019t know better and I talked to her about it.\n\nYou really need to not coddle this behavior. Isabelle did mean harm, and 10 is old enough to know better. Telling her sister that she's going to hell is an awful thing to say, and 10 is old enough to know that that's an awful thing to say, and old enough to be punished for saying it.\n\nHopefully this conversation is all that has to happen, but do not get in the habit of making excuses for Isabelle's behavior and letting it go unpunished. She is old enough to be responsible for her actions, she is old enough to know better, you setting the standard that she gets to hurt others with impunity because she \"doesn't know better\" is *not* going to lead to her shedding these bigoted beliefs.", "NAH\n\nyour daughter doesn't believe you have her back. Right now everyone from children to legislatures are attacking your daughter for who she is.\n\nShe may think what she needs is for her step sister to be punished. But if you look deeper I think she fears that you won't do enough to help her when she inevitably faces discrimination.\n\nYou don't have to prove that by retroactively punishing your other daughter. But you should work to get her trust because as a trans person, it is incredibly hard to believe anyone is on our side.", "Parent to a trans kid here. Have one on one time with your daughter. Talk to her. Listen. More than anything just be there and advocate for her. this is a tough situation. I\u2019m going with NTA because the 10 year old didn\u2019t know better. For your 14 year old\u2026 she is going to feel like it is the world against her.  Make sure she understands you have her back. That you love her unconditionally. If you think they don\u2019t understand why you are doing something, over explain your actions to your child. You are not asking them for permission or letting them dictate anything but allowing them to see into your brain and also show you are thinking of them, and the nuances of other things. \n\nThat said, if the 10 year old does something like that again she needs a more severe punishment. Also\u2026 3 weeks of grounding is a long time, remember\u2026 your 14 year old just did a huge thing and is hurt. She is still a child too and sometimes loses sight of right and wrong.

She is right. She got you there.", "Big YTA. yes both your daughters did wrong. One bc she was not taught better [but that doesn't make she didn't mean it, bc she is not dumb if she was taught to fear hell as punishment she knew it was a bad thing, so imo she was intentionally hurtful bc her upbringing] and instead of actually trying to teach her that what she did was wrong and she can't just get away with saying hurtful thing to other you chose was basically \"hug it over\" and press your other daughter so accept her apologies bc she didn't knew better [that making it like the verbal attack she received was not big thing bc she \"didn't know better\ud83e\udd7a\". So G seems it as you just let it slide [bc you did] and takes \"justice\" in her hands an terrorize your foster daughter[intentional hurtful bc she was trying to hurt her back] and know suddenly you can't hug it over and she has to clean OTHER KIDS PEE (bc you couldn't do it at the moment so who is better than your older kid to \"teach a lesson\" right? Fuck no) and over a absolutely disgusting punishment is another one that is 3 weeks long. You are showing preference so much that you didn't care how you daughter feels after being attacked in her own home. Just bc someone doesn't know better means it hurt less, you taught her that you don't have her back when she js being attacked.\n\nYou did both girls dirty, a simple talk won't undo 2 years of hateful rhetoric, and cleaning her sisters pee won't teach her that what she did was overtop and wrong.", "Gabrielle was condemned in her own home. You did nothing to reassure her that this is a safe space for her. She is at a higher risk for mistreatment out in the world, I'm sure you know this. You failed her here. She got revenge, she got punished. But the punishment (to her eyes) is a transgender girl having to clean the bodily mess of a cisgender girl. One who wasn't punished for spouting off hateful things to her. \n\nHow is your daughter supposed to trust you?  The punishment sounds like it will solidify the idea that you prefer the foster daughter over your daughter based on your transphobia.\n\nAre both girls in therapy? Because it sounds like you're going to cause issues for your kid mentally  if you don't get Isabella in check. Is Isabella getting help to address her problematic beliefs?", "I was honestly leaning towards NAH until I got to the part about a 14-year-old girl terrorizing a 10-year-old girl for not knowing any better.

That is inexcusable. You shouldn't set a dog on a person for being a transphobic jerk, so you definitely don't do it to a child who doesn't know any better. \n\nNTA. Gabrielle did something very bad and needs to understand what she did was wrong. She also needs to understand that a 10-year-old is like a sponge and the situation just wrung her out. She needs to be taught that the things she heard from grown-ups before weren't true, not scared out of her mind in a way that teachers her absolutely nothing.", "Have you had a conversation with Isabelle to determine why she said that? \n\nBecause it seems more to me that she wasn\u2019t saying it as a threat or to be cruel, but more out of fear that someone she cares for may be going to Hell.", "YTA both deserve to be punished in a manner that fits the bad thing they did", "NTA everyone in these comments are forgetting the child who \"was homophobic\" was 10 YEARS OLD! What she said was learned behavior that, as long as you work towards correcting it and not letting it happen again, you are definitely NTA. The older daughter tried to exact revenge on a child who knows no better. That was a horrible thing to do, especially since it was a first offense and the kid is so young. She should not have put your daughter in physical danger over words", "Idk if you\u2019re the AH or not; there are a lot of good arguments for both sides on here but what I do know is that if the foster child stays living in your home, your daughter will most likely come to resent you for it. Sometimes you have to put one child\u2019s vulnerabilities above another\u2019s & it may be that you have to choose which child you prioritise. Finding good foster homes for children is hard & I imagine you don\u2019t wish to uproot the child again, especially if her previous foster experiences have been toxic, but from what I know most people would choose to put the well-being of their biological child before a foster child & if you don\u2019t do that, you could do some serious damage to your daughter\u2019s mental health & your relationship with her, plus her relationships with her biological siblings. It may just be a \u201cone-off\u201d incident to you but what that child said to your daughter will likely haunt her & she will be reminded of it every time someone else is transphobic toward her, or even just every time she sees you showing affection toward the foster child. If you keep the child in your home, your daughter will suffer because of it, even if another transphobic comment is never uttered again.", "I feel like the majority of people passing judgement here have no experience of children who have been in a children\u2019s home or foster care. These children are generally there for pretty horrific reasons. Most of the children I\u2019ve worked with who have been in or are in foster care or group homes have pretty traumatic early starts in life alongside neurodivergence. You cannot make a teachable moment in the heat of the moment. It needs to be deescalated and re-addressed at a calmer time.\nHowever, what Gabriella did was malicious. It was intentional and spiteful. Yes she was incredibly hurt, but she acted out against a 10 year old who genuinely didn\u2019t know better as that was WHAT SHE WAS TAUGHT by the previous adults who were her carers. A young child believes what adults in a position of authority over them tell them.\nOP did the best in a very difficult situation, though perhaps could have done more to comfort Gabrielle. \nNTA, but Gabrielle clearly needs more support to not feel she has been ignored. Grounding may not be the right move as other have said about stewing on her feelings, but her actions against Isabelle need consequences.", "NTA, the difference is your oldest knew what she was doing was wrong. Correcting the younger was appropriate as a first step. An extra chore or two, perhaps helping the eldest with something wouldn't have hurt.\n\nThankfully your dog isn't aggressive. That situation could have escalated so easily through no fault of the dog or the child. Bio daughter may have jealousy issues with foster daughter that will make any interaction between them intensify.", "NTA. There is a big difference between unknowingly offending someone and purposely putting person in danger. In addition there is a difference between 10 years old and 14 year old. You have handled the situation with grace and wisdom", "I\u2019m going with Yta on this one. \n\nAdoptee here for reference. \n\nI get the hardships Isabelle has endured, the need for assessment. I also get how this was the first time and it takes years to undo years of piss poor fostering.\n\nI see that you made her apologize for her ignorance, but what makes you the asshole is when you failed to realize just how painful,intense and hurtful her actions where. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine coming out, then being yelled that you are \u201cgoing to hell\u201d . In front of all the family, think of the level of shame, hurt,disgust etc Gabrielle would have felt in that moment. Being trans is not easy, nor is coming out. I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like to be humiliated in front of the family and not see their sibling get any repercussions, ignorance or not. Im not surprised she made a calculated decision to terrorize Isabelle. I\u2019m not saying it was right, but I too would channel everything I was feeling and lash out at 14. \n\nYou miss the mark terribly here, even a minor punishment would have worked but a talking too?

I bet you are coddling her given your comments \u201c I won\u2019t be able to leave without her\u201d stop babying her, yes you can and she needs to learn. One of the biggest mistakes adopted/foster parents make is coddling and enabling the very behaviors that need to be broken.  \n\n3 weeks on top of clean up is cruel. \n\nMy best piece of advice is to make sure you don\u2019t loose a daughter trying to play savior to another.

To me it sounds like Isabelle was panicked by the idea of someone she liked doing something that could lead them to go to hell. It's not like she yelled trans people are *hateful slurs*. She said you can't be trans because trans people go to hell, implying she does not want Gabrielle to go to hell. \n\nGiven she's only 10 and her background, does she even understand what trans means other than her previous foster parents told her it was bad. She needs this to be explained to her clearly and calmly and probably not by Gabrielle in the first instance.\n\nI dont believe Isabelle was intentionally malicious. Gabrielle was clearly and intentionally malicious to a child 4 years younger than her. I'm not sure about appropriate punishments. What you need is for Isabelle to recognize she was wrong (which it sounds like she does) and Gabrielle to recognize she was wrong (which it sounds like she doesn't). \n\nDoes Gabrielle like the fact you have a foster child? How did Gabrielle expect you to punish Isabelle? Could Isabelle perhaps be tasked with writing an essay about trans people and the predjudice they face. You could expand this to several essays to cover other groups she has been taught to hate. You could help her with the research and ensure it is more of a learning oippertunity than a straight up punishment. Could Gabrielle perhaps write an essay on foster children and some of the issues they face. You need to encourage understanding not division", "YTA", "NTA.  I sympathise with Your daughter as it must be a difficult time for her, but she is 14 years old and more than old enough to understand that Isabelle is only 10 and coming from homes where she was taught to parrot vile stuff.

That is a parental/guardian duty)Nor do I think Isabelle ought to be punished [edit: on that occasion]- explaining to her was the right course of action. \n\nWhat Gabrielle did was malicious.

I understand why she didn't give her and why she got upset so you know... You are sort of TAH for punishing Gabrielle though. It needs to be equal in delicate situations like this with a previously outside child. You cannot show even the slightest favoritism or it will have terrible emotional affects on all of them. Tread lightly mama. It's a difficult situation you're in and I don't fault you for being conflicted.", "NTA. Isabelle is young, was taught this by another family, and is unlearning all of that WITH a potential delay that could make processing things hard. She accepted your explanation and apologized, just like any child learning should do. If she kept doing it, that would be different.\n\nIt sounds like Gabrielle has a bit of a persecution complex-- something I see pretty frequently in young trans and LGBT spaces, unfortunately. Her sister might have said something hurtful, but she apologized and there's an expectation (I'm assuming) that she WOULD have a consequence if it was repeated. Gabrielle was hurt and wanted you to hurt a younger sibling in retaliation-- understandable but not something to act on. When you didn't comply with her demand, she intentionally did something she knew would be traumatizing. That's incredibly cruel, especially to a kid who already has an inherently traumatic past from separation alone if nothing else. \n\nI'd take some time with Gabrielle to take her out and go clothes shopping or get coffee or something that makes her feel invested in and supported and then also talk to her about maturity levels and how trauma disrupts the brain and how it learns. Isabelle changing her behavior IS a victory and an improvement, and being trans doesn't give G the right to treat others badly because she's mad or hurt. She's making a big transition right now (no pun intended) and might feel very sensitive and on edge-- Isabelle is ALSO going through one intense transition after another and didn't choose any of it. She didn't pick why she was in foster care to begin with, she didn't choose to be with a family that taught her that, she didn't choose to have delays. It doesn't mean she never has consequences but it does mean she needs grace and time and that correction might look different for her than for another kid, but the goal is changed and appropriate behavior, NOT making someone feel awful just to make them feel bad.", "Time for som major family counciling.

You're doing your best in a difficult situation.", "I disagree, but because I'm coming from a different perspective; I work with dogs professionally at a training kennel. There is no excuse at any time to lock a large, powerful dog with a small child that is terrified of it; I don't care if you have the most docile dog in the universe, that is a recipe for getting someone hurt, even extremely hurt. Dogs are animals so they're unpredictable, and then so are terrified kids - if Isabelle had reacted by throwing things at the dog, or striking the dog (which I wouldn't blame her for, given that she is 10 amd scared), even a very docile and very well-trained animal can be pushed to their limit. There is no such thing as \"my dog would never do that.\" Every animal has a threshold. I have seen service dogs that have been raised to be trained as service dogs since they were young, given all the exposure training imaginable, all the socialization imaginable, never had a single behavioral issue, hit that threshold where they're not thinking, they're reacting. These are dogs with thousands and thousands of hours of dedicated training, not just a family pet. \n\nThis isn't a prank, this could have killed that girl. The \"sweet pupper\" culture of the internet has convinced people that dogs are always sweet, safe, and reliable, and they're not. I love dogs, I spend my whole life with dogs, that does not make them less dangerous. I've been bitten by dogs people swore were their gentle family pets. It would be fine not to ground Gabriella if, say, she had eaten Isabelle's last fruit cup, or hidden her book, or anything that is actually harmless. But this isn't that. Dogs are incredibly sensitive to our moods, and children don't come equipped with innate knowledge about how dogs work, or that obsessive barking is a sign of hyperarousal and stress that inevitably leads to dogs in a state of mind that leads to their worst decisionmaking, even in animals that have never hurt anyone and are usually entirely harmless. You don't leave young kids unattended with large dogs, period, much less terrified kids, who have no idea how to manage their emotions and that of the dog's. \n\nI understand that Gabrielle was very hurt but I think the grounding is absolutely completely necessary given that everyone is genuinely lucky no one got injured. Putting someone at risk of getting bit, and then putting the dog at risk of being on the hook if something horrible had happened, is not a \"restraint\" situation, that is a \"you could have killed someone, find a way to vent your emotions that doesn't involve throwing a pair of canines at a ten year old, chew on that while you're grounded\" situation.

Nice name calling a 10 year old as well.", "How about down to zero and then ground Isabella for hurting Gabrielle?", "There's medical transitioning, which is hormones and surgery, and there's social transitioning, which is using your right name, wearing clothes you want, being addressed as your gender, etc. Kids socially transition, and recieve puberty blockers if they're lucky, so if they later realize they're not trans, no harm done", "Not offended, just annoyed lol. There\u2019s social transitioning and then physical transitioning. For all we know this kid could be testing out socially transitioning, hate it, and decide they do not know what they identify with yet. Transitioning from mtf doesn\u2019t automatically mean hormone blockers and surgery.", "One said something she was taught and when OP explained why it was wrong she was ready to apologize. No mention of it happening again.\n\n\nThe other knowingly took a big dog into the room of a person with a dog phobia and closed the door. Not ready to apologize \n\n\nI think it is clear who I would punish in this situation. Just because bio daughter is trans she is not suddenly free of consequences. That was a disgusting thing to do IMO. Don't accept the apology if you're not ready. But revenge (especially with such overkill) is never ok.", "Foster kid is an indoctrinated 10 year old. I don't really think she can be held responsible for this incident.\n\nPoor thing probably has a lot of unlearning to do.", "The younger child was just repeating what she was taught.  The OLDER child was malicious.  They are not nearly the same.", "She's a new kid in the house and the dog might not treat her the same, especially in a stressful environment where she's screaming her head off. Pretending a child who was taught the wrong thing from birth a transphobe at 10 is ridiculous.", "Oooh so you are one of those \u201cenlightened centrists\u201d who thinks that not welcoming bigots is the same as being a bigot? \ud83e\udd23", "I didn't say it was, I said you're trying to cancel the first child with your horrible name calling and remarks over a mistake", "Wrong. The invited the child into their home and the child chose to be hurtful to one of their kids in a very vulnerable moment. The bigot being made to apologize doesn\u2019t fix that.", "Yes, she did. She chose to yell something hurtful. Her being made to say \u201csorry\u201d after doesn\u2019t change that. She deserved punishment. You making excuses for transphobia just makes you look like a bully.", "If they had acted like responsible parents and grounded the 10 year old for the horrid thing she yelled that would have helped. But instead they chose to not stand up for their child and let her endure that in her own home, followed by trying to push her into accepting the 10 year old saying \u201csorry\u201d as if that did anything. The harm of having that yelled at her was just as real as the harm of being in the room with the family pet.", "It\u2019s weird that you keep commenting about how you think kicking her out is what everyone is advocating for. Have you never heard of the punishment called \u201cgrounding?\u201d It\u2019s where kids have to put up with no screen time for awhile.", "She chose to yell hurtful things to another kid in a vulnerable moment. She should be grounded for it. Stop coddling bigots, weirdo.", "How was she in physical danger? If the dog is safe enough for a 14 year old to care for by herself the dog should be safe enough to be in a room with a 10 year old. \n\nAnd if you think that having someone yell transphobic things at you when you come out isn\u2019t going to cause someone PTSD you\u2019re fucked up. What she said was faaaaaar worse than just being \u201crude.\u201d", "Drama Queen.\n\nI sincerely doubt that the OP would keep a dangerous dog.\n\nIt's big and loud.\n\nAt 10 Isabella knew exactly how to manipulate the situation and so she did.", "Bullshit. There\u2019s no way even a 10 year old thinks that yelling that someone is going to hell isn\u2019t hurtful.", "10 year olds know that yelling something hurtful is going to hurt someone. Even a bigoted one.", "Hey thank you for the response. I appreciate the gained knowledge.", "I appreciate the responses and gained knowledge. Now if you'll excuse me I'll take my downvotes into oblivion in peace lol", "Then it\u2019s time to break that bad behaviour weeks ago, op failed to parent the first situation and it got out of control. Shocking\u2026 not", "Sure, they\u2019re not the same. One had something evil yelled at her to hurt her in a vulnerable moment. The other was in a room with the family pet.", "If the dog isn\u2019t safe to be around then they shouldn\u2019t be the dog in the home. Pretending a child who tells transphobic shit at a trans person isn\u2019t transphobic is ridiculous.", "I'm a gay person who thinks getting the pitchforks out for a learning-disabled 10 year old is a bit much.", "You make it sound like they purposefully had an asshole guest visit their home. They adopted an abused kid who unsurprisingly has a messed up world view. They weren\u2019t born a bigot. OP has already said that if there were to be any future anti-trans talk from the child, they would be punished. She stood up for her new daughter - the 14 year old. Who does not get to abuse an animal and a severely traumatized 10 year old, under any circumstances.", "You\u2019re dead set on hating an abused 10 year old child. Maybe you need to sit with that and figure out what\u2019s going on in your life that you lack empathy to this extraordinary degree.", "Jesus fucking Christ on a stick. You are talking about a 10 year old here. In addition, she came from an abusive background and was taught hate. She was just taken on by a what seems like a much better foster family. Give them a chance to learn and do better.", "You punish kids when they do something they know is  wrong. If a kid does something wrong because they weren't taught otherwise, punishment won't teach them anything. And for a foster kid, it will alienate them from the family even more. It's the fault of the parent, not the kid. \n\nYou truly seem to think she wasn't actually sorry. Why? Do you really think kids are incapable of learning and growing?", "She literally didn't understand what it meant lmao.\n\nBut stay strong on your war against children. Keep fighting that good fight, soldier", "If it was malicious then yes it was rude but the child didn't know any better, saying \"you're going to hell\" is no where near as damaging as being terrorized by your own family", "The child woke the house screaming and wet herself out of fear but she definitely knew what she was doing, crafty bastard /s", "Bullshit, I have a 10 year old and his age group can very easily not know something is hurtful instead of facts. She thought it was facts, she was corrected and apologized. The older sibling didn't want a \"sorry\" they wanted the other child to hurt and that's not ok.", "If a child who grows up in a strongly religiously family, and hasn't been told any different makes them ignorant, not a bigot... shouting you'll go to hell sounds like a scared child worried about her sister. Try stepping off your pedestal and making a 10 year old out as even knowing how to intentionally attack someone's gender identity. That's outrageous.", "The child spent two years getting fed the usual alt right propaganda, it takes time to unlearn shit like that when it\u2019s been drilled into you repeatedly. You don\u2019t just come out of a situation like that at 10 years old and immediately unlearn all the hate you\u2019ve been fed. You don\u2019t just wake up in your new foster home and go \u201cwell I\u2019ve forgotten all the nazi ideals that I\u2019ve been taught for the last two years :)\u201d \n\nI do think she should have faced more of a punishment than just getting talked to, she should have been grounded or given Gabrielle\u2019s choirs for the week, but she didn\u2019t deserve to have her extreme phobia used against her in her sleep. That\u2019s not how you teach a child recovering from alt right indoctrination to empathize with queer people.", "Had they shown their trans child an iota of the empathy they show the foster child, perhaps, their trans child would not have felt the need to get hit back.\n\nI blame the way the parents handled this situation.", "You\u2019re dead set on coddling a child who chose to cause harm to another child who was in a very vulnerable moment. Maybe you should sit with that and figure out why you lack any empathy towards the girl who had to endure someone yelling transphobic shit at her when she came out.", "Jesus fucking Christ on a stick. You are talking about a child who chose to cause harm to another child who was in a very vulnerable moment. The harm she chose to cause isn\u2019t negated by her past.", "You punish kids when they do something to hurt someone else. Not punishing her will alienate Gabrielle from her own parents.", "She literally knew what she meant LMAO. But stay strong on your war of defending bigots.", "Having someone scream at you that you are going to hell when you come out is way more damaging than being around the family pet.", "You are, obviously, sympathetic to the issues a trans child faces.\n\nIsabella knew she was being hurtful.", "Um, being told you\u2019re going to hell IS being terrorized by your own family.", "I\u2019ve seen someone start screaming at the sight of a Maltese because she was scared or dogs. Her screaming doesn\u2019t mean the dog was dangerous or that she was in the slightest bit to danger.", "She knew she was being hurtful when she told Gabrielle she was going to hell for being trans.", "Gabrielle didn\u2019t deserve to have someone her parents invited into her home yell horrible things at her in a vulnerable moment with no repercussions.", "Ah yes, this learning-disabled 10 year old had it coming to her.  /s", ">You punish kids when they do something to hurt someone else.\n\nWhen they knowingly and intentionally hurt someone else. The kid wasn't trying to be hurtful. She was parroting someone else's hurtful words without understanding the meaning. Which is something all kids do.\n\nThe kid understands it's wrong now. She apologized, she won't do it again. What is punishment going to achieve here?\n\n>Not punishing her will alienate Gabrielle from her own parents\n\nThe purpose of punishment should never be to satiate the other child. The purpose of punishment is to teach, not get revenge.", "Where's your mother? Haven't you reached your screen time maximum for the day? Grounded. Tisk tisk.", ">She literally knew what she meant LMAO\n\nAnd you know this how?", "It most certainly is not when you have a phobia of this pet, don't have children. You'll end up abusing them for being simply wrong", "As someone with many trans friends and who also identifies as non-binary, I wouldn't try to seek revenge on a 10 year old special needs kid for something their racist family taught them", "[removed]", "You don't know many children, do you?", "Someone else screaming at a different dog that happens to be the same breed has absolutely NOTHING to do with this situation, you just want to damn a child for a mistake", "Because her birth parents taught her this. She was told that's how homosexuality works, she was repeating what she learned."]}
