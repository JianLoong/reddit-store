Older people have this respect expectation thinking they can say whatever the fuck they want to you, no matter how degrading, passive aggressive or hurtful it is and then turn around and start crying about something like this.

From what you said, I'd definitely think the stepmom is putting you down and making you feel worthless for no reason except to be mean (or because she simply values you so little, which is hurtful for her to think, and even crueler for her to say out loud). \n\nHave you had a one-on-one talk with your dad or sister about the specific comments she's made over time, and how the things she's said and her behaviors have made you feel? I'm assuming she's said mean things before the breakup as well - if so, I'd mention those things too.\n\nYou can apologize for the words you chose if you want to mend bridges, but make it clear you don't apologize for the true intent of what you meant - which was \"stop telling me how little you value me, and stop trying to put me down\".", "NTA, she can be rude and it's perfect but if you retaliate you are suddenly the bad guy, I call BS, at least your father is on your side (some bro energy there XD), tell her to apaologize and if she does it then work things out, if not, she doesn't sound like a person you would want in your life.", "NTA.\n\nMake sure your dad knows what she has been saying.

I accept that telling someone to eff off isn't the most diplomatic way of getting to stop, but allowances can be made for a teenager who is suffering and being tormented about his suffering by the person he told to do one.\n\nYou expect more maturity from an adult. Even if she was a complete stranger, there would be no excuse for her tormenting him. She's actually his stepmother which means she should be setting an example for and nurturing him.\n\nThat the dad, the only other adult in the equation, agrees with his son says it all.", "> Things like 'Well, you obviously weren't worth her time', or 'What did you really expect would happen when you started dating her?'\n\nLook, you lose the privilege of civility when you start saying shit like this.
