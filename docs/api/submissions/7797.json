Two good reasons to not give them POA and executorship.  I agree, you are the best suited for this responsibility.\n\nOf course, the decision lies with your parents.\n\nBut others should keep in mind that sometimes parents have dumbass reasons for picking a person to be POA /executor and make a really crappy decision that negatively impacts their family.\n\nMy parents \"Chris\" and \"Pat\" picked sibling A, because \"she lived close by in the same town\".  Us other sibs lived more than a couple hours away.  I spoke to my parents about this and they were adamant that the closest sib would be available the quickest in an emergency, regardless of the reasons I gave to pick any other sib instead of A.\n\nThe papers were signed, then A ghosted the family.  Parents kept saying that A would \"come around\".\n\nWell.  Less than two years later, Pat died, and A was nowhere to be found.  Me and other sibs took care of Pat's funeral, and A showed up at the funeral.  A then invoked POA to take Chris (who had alzheimers) with them,  and immediately put Chris into a home. We had to call APS to find out where Chris was. A pays the monthly bill using Chris's medicare, pension, SS and savings.  That should pay for the facility for 5 years.  A pays for nothing else.  Does not take care of Chris'  toiletries, clothing, adult diapers, or medical appointments. Does not visit, does not send cards. Did not shoe up when Chris had a medical emergency.  A has ghosted again.  I don't know what will happen if Chris is still living when the money runs out.\n\nSo yeah.  Parents make their own decisions. Sometimes they make really shitty decisions that impact the rest of the family.  I wish we had argued with them when they made this decision.  Sometimes I wish that I could shut off my love and emotions so I didn't have to care for my parent every week, and sometimes listen to my parent asking \"where is A?\".\n\nEdit - me and other sibs visit at least weekly, recommend to staff when Chris should have doctor appointments and med updates, and take care of everything that we can, legally (which is not much).", "If you are an inheritor, being the executor is not such a good idea.
