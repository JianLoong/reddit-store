{"id": 30525, "submission_id": "17q5frn", "title": "AITA for refusing to participate in religious activities with my boyfriend\u2019s family?", "selftext": "I (22F) grew up in a cult. It was one of the really, really bad ones. I ran when I was 15 and I haven\u2019t spoken to anyone in my family or that community since then. Due to my experiences, organized religion makes me uncomfortable and I try to avoid situations that involve it. Other people are welcome to their beliefs, I just don\u2019t want to hear about it or participate. I also do not react well to having my boundaries and pushed. So it\u2019s possible I\u2019m behaving badly out of being overcautious and triggered.\n\nMy boyfriend (24) and I have been dating for almost 2 years and have gone very slow at my request, but we agree there\u2019s a future ahead and I met his family earlier this year. He did warn me that his family are practicing Catholics but he made it sound like it\u2019s more of a cultural and family tradition thing. He\u2019s openly agnostic himself, but will go to church with his parents and siblings when he\u2019s home sometimes because it\u2019s family time.\n\nIt\u2019s way more involved than advertised. His family is doing something at church or his siblings\u2019 religious school all the time. His parents are nice enough, but they creep me out because I can see a lot of similar shades and attitudes to what I grew up with even if it\u2019s not as extreme. We have an open invitation to Sunday lunch and my boyfriend wants me to get to know his siblings and parents more so he wants us to go every other week. His parents want us to go to church with them all before lunch as a family and I just can\u2019t. I also can\u2019t with the prayers and everything. The whole thing opens up the subject for his parents to ask about my family and spiritual background, which I won\u2019t talk about and it\u2019s awkward. I\u2019ve been ditching church and joining them at lunch, but it\u2019s an elephant in the room \n\nIt turned into a big deal this weekend because one of his cousins was being baptized, which is a big deal apparently. I said I didn\u2019t want to go to the ceremony, but I would bring a gift for the baby to the party afterward and my boyfriend got really annoyed and said that it\u2019s rude and I can suck it up long enough to sit through Mass now and then for family stuff like he does. It\u2019s a cheap way to make his parents happy and what am I going to do, skip every single wedding and christening in the family after we get married? I told him maybe this wasn\u2019t going to work if church was such a big part of everything and now he\u2019s mad that I don\u2019t care enough to get past this.", "created_utc": 1699393534, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17q5frn/aita_for_refusing_to_participate_in_religious/", "score": 239, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you \u201csuck it up\u201d now you\u2019re going to be expected to do so in the future. Wedding- suck it up and have it at a church; kids- suck it up and get them baptized. You need to really think about whether this is something you\u2019re willing to live with because at this point it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re compatible at all", "NTA. But it sounds like this is a dealbreaker. Your aversion to religion is completely understandable and valid. For your boyfriend, though, these bits of religiosity are also closely tied to his family culture. It probably doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d very religious to him\u2014but a baptism is definitely, undeniably religious. He shouldn\u2019t be dismissing your feelings here, and he needs to come to terms with the entirely fair reality that if you were married, you _would_ be skipping every single christening. If he\u2019s not willing to accept that, then the two of you are, sadly, simply incompatible.", "NTA, and you\u2019re right. There\u2019s a good chance this won\u2019t work. \n\nHe\u2019s right to a degree: where do you draw the line? Will you skip weddings and funerals, because I can tell you as someone raised Catholic and very much an atheist, that I sit through those masses because it\u2019s for family. He very much wants a partner that can be there for those, and you\u2019re not wrong for not being able to get through them, but if you can\u2019t it\u2019s a major incompatibility. He\u2019s an AH for trying to guilt trip you past your trauma\u2026but Catholics and people raised Catholic are taught guilt tripping to an almost subconscious level. It\u2019s something he needs to unlearn. \n\nIf you see a future with him, I think you HAVE to discuss your past with his family. Otherwise what you\u2019re doing just seems rude. A lot of people would hear your story and fully understand. A lot of others would hear it and think \u201cthat sucks but WE\u2019RE not a cult!\u201d As they continue on with their ingrained ritualistic chanting. I think understanding what kind of people his family are would be critical to understanding if there is a future. That\u2019s if you can even get past the immediate issue of whether you can attend bigger events with him at all though, if you can\u2019t do that, any discussion with his family is a moot point.", "NTA.  Not going to church in general with them is a no-brainer, but if you're not even able to attend family ceremonies that are in church, I think you need to offer some sort of explanation, even something like \"I grew up with some religious trauma and I don't really want to talk about it, but I am not comfortable in churches.\"", "what will happend if you two will have kid and his side of the family and my guess him as well will want to baptize that kid , will you let them ?", "I think it may be important for you to disclose that you have some religious trauma. You don\u2019t have to go into details but have you hinted at it with any of his family? If you are still considering being with him, then giving a reason - and yours is a VERY good reason - may help them frame your reactions and understand it better why you don\u2019t want to participate \n\nNTA because your boyfriend knows your history and is completely disregarding your comfort. But it\u2019s not clear if his family would feel the same way if they knew the truth, maybe they would even be more supportive of you than your bf is", "\"It\u2019s a cheap way to make his parents happy\"\n\nAnd what he is doing to make you happy and safe? (I suppose he knows your past)\n\n\"and what am I going to do, skip every single wedding and christening in the family after we get married?\"\n\nYes. Forcing a non-believer to assist or take part to a religious ceremony is bad.\nIt looks like he doesn't care about your boundaries, or he's trying to drag you toward his religion. I wouldn't be surprised.\n\nETA: NTA", "*dating for almost 2 years and have gone very slow at my request, but we agree there\u2019s a future ahead* \n\nSorry to inform you but there is not a future ahead for the 2 of you. Having a future with him would mean 1) you'd have to disclose a certain amount of info to his family about your upbringing 2) you'd have to 'suck it up' for the 'sake' of the family 3) your bf will continue to push this boundary as well as any other boundary you may have in service to his parents' demands 4) most likely they will try to demonstrate (through force) how much better their religion is than the cult and why you must follow their ~~cult~~ path\n\nNope. Through absolutely no fault of your own, this relationship is over.\n\nNTA", "NTA and if he can't respect your boundaries, you may have to reconsider this relationship. No religious activities means absolutely none. He can either accept that, or lose you.", "NTA, and frankly, your boyfriend's underplaying of what a practicing Catholic family engages in religiously and trying to force you to just 'go along with it' is a flag. He doesn't want to see similarities, but you also shouldn't have to sit there in front of his family and bare your wounds to them to get them to leave you alone. And tbh, it kind of sounds like he's the one getting upset more than his parents/family are.\n\nYou do not have to 'get past this'. You have a trauma and he's being very cold and inconsiderate about it. The fact he can't see it's a trauma or that there's comparisons is concerning. I think you have the right of it that you might not be compatible. 'Compromising' on this is going to lead to you 'just doing this' for the rest of your relationship. \"You did it for xyz's baptism. Just do it for xyz's mass.\"", "Girl, run. He's trying to push your boundaries. He knows damn well what they are, and he thinks he can steamroll you into acceptance. \n\nYou think he wouldn't pressure you into a Catholic church wedding to \"make his family happy?\" Think again.", "NTA\n\nYour boundaries are clear.\n\nBut he likely will never understand if he doesn\u2019t now or asap, and this will be on going argument\n\nI\u2019d have a conversation that if he can\u2019t respect it now, then you have no future", "NTA\n\nYou have a good reason for having the boundaries that you do, and your BF is pushing hard against them. If you marry him, it'll be expected to be a church wedding, if you have kids, baptisms. You can't just \"suck it up\" for those things. \n\nIt may be that you've reached a point in your relationship where you're just not compatible anymore. Can you really imagine your life with this man and skipping all the big family events, or just having to \"suck it up\" for the sake of keeping the peace with his family?", "NTA and if after two years your agnostic boyfriend doesn't understand how traumatising it would be foor you then he sucks", "NTA. It's not a matter of getting over this. It's an issue of boundaries and them trying to break yours. Only you will know if or when you will be comfortable in a non-secular setting. You really need to address your issues of being raised in a cult. Seek out a professional that works in this realm. You can only be happy in life when you are happy with who you are.", "Nta-I grew up catholic, and I just say no. The only time I\u2019ve participated as an adult was my brothers funeral. I show up for baptism/receptions and often skip the ceremony. One of the best lessons I picked up from church/catholic school was you be the best you, you can be (and of course-do unto others as you would have them do unto you), so they should respect this. Personally they shouldn\u2019t be pressuring either (like wtf!-who wants someone to play lip service to God?)- I get the invite, but participation, really?!", "NTA.  Lapsed Catholic here.  They are converting you.  It would mean so much to his parents to see you married in a church.  How about just a blessing then?  Of course, you have to go to a few classes first, but that's just a little more time.  Don't you love him?  Well of course, you have to promise to baptize your kids.\n\nRemember, in their eyes, they are saving you.  This treatment is only going to get more intense.  It already has.  Rather than getting used to just meeting you at lunch, they are increasing the pressure.", "NTA and I\u2019m still scarred to this day over my religious upbringing. I don\u2019t have any good advice I just feel for you Op. good luck.", "NTA and i disagree with the people who think you should disclose your trauma (in any capacity). \nTrauma or no trauma - setting the boundary of 'no church and church-related activities' should be completely enough. At the very least for your boyfriend, who should be able to respect it and just discuss with his family of completely secular ways to spend time together that includes you. If that is not possible, or he doesn't think it's acceptable to ask of that, but is acceptable to ask you to participate in activities that are church-adjacent, then i think you've reached a deal breaker.", "NTA. I've been atheist or agnotic-leaning-strongly-toward atheism since high school. My husband, who I adore and am very glad I married, was agnostic when I met him and was raised Catholic. He's since become a devout Episcopalian, as are our children. Catholicism plays a big part in virtually everything that has to do with our visits to his family of origin.\n\nReligion was *not* a large or traumatic part of my upbringing (my family was very casually religious), and my husband and children's church is a wonderful and supportive church to my kids, who are both LGBTQ+. That said, the amount of time church requires of them and the fact that they are inflexible about it has always been extremely tough for me.\n\nI do think it's important that you fully understand that religion will certainly continue to be an important part of your boyfriend's extended family's celebrations. If they're anything like my husband's family of origin, it might also occupy a large percentage of their conversations when you visit them. In addition, I think you need to consider the likelihood that your boyfriend will become more religious as he gets older and especially if you have children, as that is often the case.\n\nI don't have a problem sitting through the occasional religious service, but I think your case is very, very different. I don't think it's remotely ok that your boyfriend is pressuring you to do so given your background. I think you're both going to have to have some serious and probably difficult conversations about religion, the extent to which you'll be expected to be exposed to religious conversations and practices around his family, and especially issues around your future children if you're thinking of having any.", "You and he/his family may just not be a good fit together.\n\nAnd you should get counciling, because you youth was so awful. It really can help you feel better, know what to say to people, know how the react with others and society in general.", "This is not the right relationship or family to be involved with as someone with religious trauma. I\u2019m sorry.", "NTA and the reality is that this very well might not work. His family would likely push hard for a church wedding, and he is clearly close enough with his family that he would much rather you tolerate church like he does. If doing any church activities is that big of a deal for you and you don't want to work on getting comfortable with it then you likely are not compatible with someone who has a churchy family and is family oriented, even if the person you are actually dating isn't religious.", "NTA. You have zero reason to give in to their cult activities. You don't want to do it. So you don't do it. Don't let them pressure you into it. No means no.", "It's not a cheap way to make his parents happy - it comes at the expense of your comfort and well-being. That's very expensive for you. Why doesn't that matter to him? NTA.", "Nta- you might want to look for a new boyfriend, if you don\u2019t like his family it can be a dealbreaker as far as getting married. You don\u2019t have any reason to participate in any religious activities that YOU don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s a free country, don\u2019t accept your boyfriend forcing you to participate in activities you don\u2019t want to", "Probably best to make it a preference to not be with someone who's religious.", "You're not compatible.", "NTA having religious trauma is a far cry from \"church is boring and I don't want to go\". Your boyfriend needs to be much more understanding about the trauma you have experienced.", "NTA but you aren\u2019t compatible. I grew up in a cult and have serious church trauma too. It\u2019s the worst and you have every right to not be forced into religious activities. Be kind to yourself and do what\u2019s best for your mental health. Therapy is a good thing to help you deal as well.", "NAH. It might be a case of the two of you not being compatible. His family are unlikely to stop being as religious so if you stay with him this is something that you will have to deal with your whole life. If/when the two of you get married it's likely his family will want a church wedding and that he will likely agree to it so when you don't it's going to cause huge issues. If/when you have children his family/he are likely going to want the children to be baptised. Is this really what you want to/are ready to deal with your whole life?", "NAH\n\nReligion is a major part of people's lives and when two people have strong, incompatible views that can often be a dealbreaker.", "Assuming your partner is aware of your history and you had the conversation about not wanting to go to family events in church such as baptisms, then you aren't the AH.  Knowing his family are religious, you definitely should have had these conversations before getting 2 years into a relationship.  I am not religious in any way, but I will still attend if its a family event, so I can definitely see his point.  But again, it this was discussed beforehand, then it seems a little shitty for him to suddenly be arsey about it.", "NTA. Doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re dating the right person for you though based on values and your triggers.", "NTA I would be very suspicious over him saying he is agnostic because he\u2019s going to church a lot for someone who is not a believer! Take care of yourself and don\u2019t let him guilt you into anything that you don\u2019t want \ud83d\ude1e", "NTA. \n\nHe is showing you who he is. Be thankful he showed you before you were already engaged or be damm sure there would be a meeting with the Priest scheduled while you were there too.", "NTA I grew up in the Worldwide Church of God, which is now considered a cult. I have never celebrated holidays and still don\u2019t to this day. I used to be married to a guy who\u2019s family is obsessed with Christmas and it became a big deal because I didn\u2019t want to tell my kids the whole Santa thing and his nieces and nephews definitely believed in him. I refused to put up a tree or decorate and I\u2019d never been trick or treating so I had no clue what to even expect there. He resented me because in his heart he wanted that Christmas magic that he thought he had growing up. \n\nI understand where you\u2019re coming from. I can\u2019t go to church now. No desire at all to sit through it.", "Op is it possible boyfriend doesn\u2019t really have a good sense of how traumatic this was for you? I\u2019m going with NTA. I was baptized and grew up Mormon for several years while I was in a foster home. Since about 16/17 years old I decided it wasn\u2019t for me at all and have nothing to do with organized religion at all. Much like you I don\u2019t want people pushing their religion on me at all. Btw so glad you were able to get away from that cult. Many people can\u2019t do more power to you to live the life you want and one that makes you happy.", "NTA. It\u2019s only cheap because it doesn\u2019t cost him anything. But it costs you so much.", "Even without your abusive experience with religion, nta.  You shouldn't feel compelled to attend a service.  \n\nThat said, if your bf is unable to understand your position and run interference, you have no future with him.\n\nThis will not get better with time.\n\n/Progressive Christian", "Being part of a cult leave you fucked up, you're NTA. Your boyfriend is not paying attention to your boundaries and is not treating your traumas with respect. If something triggers you, girl, don't do it, don't get back to those places on your mind, take care and stand up for yourself.", "NAH - Sounds like you two are just not compatible.", "NAH, but maybe you should consider therapy. You will miss many important events in any partners or friends lives by refusing to never set foot in a church. Expecting to go to special events like christenings and weddings are not unreasonable from your partner. If he wanted to force the Sundays that would obviously be out of line, but he isn\u2019t.", "NTA and your bf should not be pushing for it. \n\nHowever, while you don't owe anyone information about your trauma, at some point I think you would need to make some sort of statement about it (or have your bf relay it to the rest of the family) if it's at the point where you can't attend baptisms, weddings, funerals etc if they are in a church. \n\nNot going to a \"regular\" religious service like Mass is one thing, I think nobody should expect that of anyone else. But many of your bf's future family events are likely to be held in churches. I think it's reasonable that people will want some sort of explanation - even a vague, brief one - as to why you won't be attending.", "Ahem. You don't care enough to get past this. This being an enormous trauma that has terrible effects on you. I hope that you are getting therapy to help you deal with that trauma, first off, but the fact is that you may never feel comfortable around religious activities and that's okay. I think if you want to salvage the relationship, then you have to share some of the hard truths about your experience and then explicitly say to him that if he cannot accept you as you are, if he cannot accept that you have been deeply traumatized and abused and may never be able to tolerate anything associated with religion, then yes, you may skip every single wedding and christening and religious holiday. Tell him he needs to know what he's getting into and if that's not going to work for him, then it's better to stop now. NTA", "Come to an agreement that you\u2019ll attend 3-4 times annually or whatever you think is a comfortable limit - perhaps zero - and then stick to it. BF should be able to say to his parents we aren\u2019t churchgoers. Weddings you can decide case by case. Missing the christening of a cousin\u2019s baby doesn\u2019t seem like any real loss. You and BF are going to have to talk thru this when the heat is not on. Personally I don\u2019t blame you after what you\u2019ve been through. NTA.", "NTA - raised Catholic, and will only go into a church for weddings and funerals.  And my uncle is a priest.  I'll drop my mother at the door for mass, pick her up, but I will NOT participate in any way shape or form. If the US church had a way of formally disassociating with the church, I would do it. \n\nI can almost assure you that his family will want a church wedding, and your boyfriend will be ok with that, because to him it's cultural.  You are not Catholic, have no intention of becoming Catholic and will not want to raise your children in the church.  If he's even thinking of this, walk now my friend.", "NAH:  But i don't see a future in this relationship.  Because obviously he would love for you to spend time with his family but due to them being religious you are refusing. Which is your right but you should just rip the bandaid off", "NTA - Run\n\nThis dude is willing to set you on fire to keep his parents warm.", "The more I think about it, I kinda have to go with a soft and gentle YTA, though may be not for the reason you think. \n\nYou obviously love him and he loves you. He has been willing to go at your pace. from what you provided he hasn\u2019t pushed your boundaries, hasn\u2019t tried to do anything but he is right that after 2 years, for someone who sees a future with him, he would want you to try and do something that means a lot to his family, especially his parents. \n\nYes it\u2019s religious. But let\u2019s put it in another context. His mom and dad really enjoy going to the park every Sunday. You don\u2019t, you hate it because something happened that traumatized you to the extent you refuse to be even around it. Your boyfriend doesn\u2019t really care for it but likes to spend time with his parents and this makes them happy so he goes sometimes. You still refuse after 2 years. You don\u2019t even bother to try and explain why you refuse to go. Your boyfriend knows but you don\u2019t want him to tell his parents. So now any time they want to go to the park as a family, you will always be excluded. You\u2019re going to get upset and resentful because why can\u2019t he just stay with you? Why does he have to go the park? \n\nAt the end of the day you either need to be honest with them or walk away. And if you haven\u2019t, get help. Actual therapy to work through. Whether you stay or not, whether it\u2019s this guy or not, religion will pop up. Even if it\u2019s just attending a wedding at a church, or a funeral, or anything else. You\u2019re going to need to learn how to see beyond your trauma to be able to be a part of events. And yes yes, people say \u201cno you don\u2019t, you don\u2019t have to go\u201d and you don\u2019t. But do you want to miss out on your friend getting married if they pick a church? Or miss out on a charity event you really believe in because it\u2019s on church grounds? It comes down to what you are willing to give up to keep avoid anything religious.", "NTA \n\nYour bf needs to prioritize making you safe and happy.\n\nIf he can't or won't, he isn't right for you.", "You don't have to go to anything that makes you uncomfortable.  However,  you're not giving people an opportunity to understand why you aren't attending anything.  If you want a future with anyone who has a family,  you're going to eventually need to let them know what triggers you and why. If you're not already in therapy, I'd suggest you find a good therapist who can help you work through some of these issues.  Soft YTA because you won't go but also won't let people know why you won't go.", "NAH.\n\nI think you simply need to communicate about this a little bit, but without history. A simple 'I care about all of you, but I'm not catholic and won't attend a mass' statement should work on the church front. Prayers at home, if you are at a meal in their home, is something you just need to live with. It's their house. Special ceremonies like baptisms are likely things you can skip now but would need to be able to suck it up if you are married, but those shouldn't be more than one a year. Everything you've done to this point is reasonable. However, most of what they've done is also reasonable, given that you really haven't broken this subject with them. No one here is an AH, but you will have to communicate, at least a little bit, in order for this to  not be something that kills your relationship.", "NAH.  The two of you have figured out that you're incompatible.", "NAH - It is trauma based, your boyfriend knows that and either you or he should explain it to his family.  If you are not willing to talk about it then don't expect them to understand.  If you are not willing to talk about it perhaps your boyfriend does not truly understand what is going on with you and you need to let him into what actually happened.  If you are never going to be able to trust any religious people, and not transfer your past experience on to all religious people, then that is a YOU problem.  I do understand your boyfriend feeling like you think his parents are abusive or trauma inducing which is not fair to all religious people.  Basically you are judging his parents for being religious and I can see why that bothers him.  Focus on the experience of Church for yourself and let them know you love them but church is an emotional trigger for you and is likely to cause you stress from PTSD.  Be clear that is not them, it is church that you have to avoid for you own mental health.", "ESH.. You both need to walk away.", "NTA You clearly have a lot of religion-related trauma and forcing yourself to participate to such activities is clearly too much for you. Your bf is an asshole when he guilt-tripped you like he did. \n\nIf you were at a stage you could tell your bf's family why anything religious makes you uncomfortable, it is possible the situation would be better (maybe they are good enough people to understand trauma. And if they aren't, then you know for sure).\n\nBut christenings, weddings, funerals, (and other ceremonies depending on culture/faith) are an integral part of family life, and they often tend to happen in a religious context, even among people who aren't especially religious. So if you have the chance, it might be wise to work on yourself to be able to face certain circumstances without panicking. \n\nNot wanting to go to church every Sunday is perfectly reasonable, since you don't want to be in an organized religion. But refusing to participate to every important  family occasion because you can't stand to be in a church is going to create problems, sooner or later. What would have you done if one of your bf's parents had died? Would you refuse to be there for him during the funeral and wait for him after?", "NAH but this will be the rest of your life so you have to figure out what you're going to do. Whether or not he's religious and has beliefs aren't the issue, he puts aside his lack of beliefs for his family, and when you're related to catholics everything is about their religion. Church and their community is their social network, kids have religion based schooling, they will have religious based plays.

It was one of the really, really bad ones. I ran when I was 15 and I haven\u2019t spoken to anyone in my family or that community since then. Due to my experiences, organized religion makes me uncomfortable and I try to avoid situations that involve it. Other people are welcome to their beliefs, I just don\u2019t want to hear about it or participate. I also do not react well to having my boundaries and pushed. So it\u2019s possible I\u2019m behaving badly out of being overcautious and triggered.\n\nMy boyfriend (24) and I have been dating for almost 2 years and have gone very slow at my request, but we agree there\u2019s a future ahead and I met his family earlier this year. He did warn me that his family are practicing Catholics but he made it sound like it\u2019s more of a cultural and family tradition thing. He\u2019s openly agnostic himself, but will go to church with his parents and siblings when he\u2019s home sometimes because it\u2019s family time.\n\nIt\u2019s way more involved than advertised. His family is doing something at church or his siblings\u2019 religious school all the time. His parents are nice enough, but they creep me out because I can see a lot of similar shades and attitudes to what I grew up with even if it\u2019s not as extreme. We have an open invitation to Sunday lunch and my boyfriend wants me to get to know his siblings and parents more so he wants us to go every other week. His parents want us to go to church with them all before lunch as a family and I just can\u2019t. I also can\u2019t with the prayers and everything. The whole thing opens up the subject for his parents to ask about my family and spiritual background, which I won\u2019t talk about and it\u2019s awkward. I\u2019ve been ditching church and joining them at lunch, but it\u2019s an elephant in the room \n\nIt turned into a big deal this weekend because one of his cousins was being baptized, which is a big deal apparently. I said I didn\u2019t want to go to the ceremony, but I would bring a gift for the baby to the party afterward and my boyfriend got really annoyed and said that it\u2019s rude and I can suck it up long enough to sit through Mass now and then for family stuff like he does. It\u2019s a cheap way to make his parents happy and what am I going to do, skip every single wedding and christening in the family after we get married? I told him maybe this wasn\u2019t going to work if church was such a big part of everything and now he\u2019s mad that I don\u2019t care enough to get past this.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He came to the door to talk to me about a chapter in the bible. I told him that we don't have one or a quoran or any hindu, jewish or buddhist scriptures. I don't share his faith so I don't worship the way that he does.\n\nI was polite but firm. I have no interest in hearing his beliefs or attending his church. I didn' t dismiss or belittle them; I just made it clear that they were his beliefs, not mine.\n\nI attend life ceremonies like weddings and funerals because I have to. But not baptisms or other religious inductions.  Even the weddings annoy me, listening to the priest dragging his deity into a couple's decision to marry. \n\nThis is OP's dilemma though. If you marry, this family will, probably with your boyfriend's support, continually pressure you to submit to their culture and their faith. They may even mean well in doing so.

He doesn't understand what attending religious ceremonies entails for you. I don't know why, but it's definitely something he needs to understand if your relationship is going to work out.

Those were my non-negotiable boundaries - the ultimatum was that if they're introduced into our relationship, I would end the relationship.  We both laid out our boundaries the first time we met, though to be fair, we talked for 14 hours straight the first time we met.  It sounds cold, but good, clear communication makes for a strong, healthy relationship.  I'm not interested in leading someone on regarding things I do not want in my relationship.

You not going to church are very valid as well!", "I think your bf was an asshole anyway for guilt-tripping like he did, but if he doesn't really know about the extent of the trauma you went through, he probably doesn't understand how underhanded he has been.\n\nDo you really have a future with him, or with anyone else if you can't be honest about how bad your upbringing was?", "The issue that I see that tips me into actual NTA territory (because there *is* an AH in this story) is that the BF *knows* that churches and the goings on therein are a place of trauma for her. She likely has C-PTSD and you don't just \"suck\" that up.", "No, we do not require conversion for non-Catholics who marry Catholics.", "Correction: Maybe it's best not to get involved with someone whose parents are religious.  Either way, he expects you to get over your past issues and appease his parents.", "No, but he is comfortable with his family\u2019s religion in a way you are not. And he doesn\u2019t seem to respect the affect your upbringing had on you", "wait till you hear what catholics think about the bread and wine. \n\nOP, i too was raised in a cult. i say you've been shown very clearly how important catholicism is to your bf and his larger family; you are perfectly within your rights to choose not to tie yourself to someone who still participates. i know i wouldn't be able to do it forever.", "Thank you.  This will prove helpful for me as well.", "That's reasonable. Or just stating flat out that church activities are off limits. A person may not owe an explanation, but they owe themselves firm boundaries.", "That does make them sound a bit like a vampire though...", ">Any kids you would have would be baptized Catholic whether you wanted to or not with this guy.\n\nAnd it wouldn't mean a thing.", "That post was wild.", "oh hey im pretty sure i have that from being raised in a cult i still hardly function as a human", "She also know she is dating a man who admitted his family is very religious and he is close to them and see them every other week.  \n\nThey both are doing the same thing.  Knowing this probably won't work and hoping the other bend", "I don't think the worry is that she would be in any way in the wrong, but that it will potentially screw up her relationship since his family will very probably not understand. Not that she should necessarily trust that they'd understand with the real explanation, but just assuming that they will comprehend the seriousness is somewhat hopeful. She's already found out that her agnostic boyfriend thinks a bunch of religious ceremonies and going to church regularly are no big deal for her, even though she presumably made it very clear that that is a huge problem.", "Yes, but not necessarily to someone with religious trauma. I am an atheist and it would 100% affect me if my kid's parent had baptized them. I know it means nothing. Doesn't matter. cPTSD from a cult is not something you can just ignore or play around with.", "Thank God someone else remembers I, I wasn't entirely positive it wasn't just a fever dream", "You're still here. That counts for something, right?\n\n\\*hugs or whatever is comforting to you\\* to you. <3", "Nope. She said that he mentioned they are practicing catholics, but made it sound like a casual cultural thing. I don't know where you got that he set the \"very religious\" expectation. He probably doesn't think they're \"very\" religious by comparison to others he grew up with.", "I absolutely agree in that respect.", "Oh yeah, that wasn't my point at all. \n\nI mean bf would be willing to traumatize her over something that doesn't mean a thing.", "Exactly. If someone I'm dating tells me their family is practicing catholic but not very religious, I'd understand a casual relationship with religion, much like the common case where I'm from:\n\nIf you ask an average family they'll say they are catholic... and that's very much it. The ones that actually practice might do sunday school up to communion or confirmation, maybe a mass now an then and celebrate weddings, funerals and baptisms in a church.\n\nMost of it is more cultural than actual worshiping.", "Because she knows this now, right?  She met them earlier this year which is almost over. \n\nSo currently she know's they are very religious"]}
