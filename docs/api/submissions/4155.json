However you really should have mentioned this and your reasoning to your friend before finalizing that decision, and you definitely need to go and discuss it with her **before** they figure out via invitations that she wasn't invited.

Well you can but you put too much value on what others think rather than being your own person who stands by her convictions.\n\nAnd in reality unless your friend and her girlfriend are engaged in overtly sexual PDA's at the wedding, your relatives may have no idea they are partners.  It's not uncommon for girls to walk with their arms around each other or hold hands.  They aren't romantically linked but just a bit more touchy feely than others.  Not my scene but I see it a lot, especially teenage girls and young adults up through to their mid 20's and even beyond.\n\nAre your family particularly judgemental, do they punish you for what others do?  If they are going to comment and makes others feel uncomfortable by their demeanor then they are not worth spending too much time with.  Their values don't align with yours, and they aren't respectful of other people and polite even if they don't agree. So why put yourself in that position to have their judgement focussed on you when it's nothing to do with you.  They will have skeletons in the closet so don't waste your time thinking about it.\n\nHave who you want at the wedding and enjoy yourself.  Don't worry about what others are thinking about anything ie food, weather, who is there.  Live in the moment as it's your wedding day.

I value my friendship with my best friend and I don't want to hurt her, but I also have to consider the feelings and opinions of my family.
