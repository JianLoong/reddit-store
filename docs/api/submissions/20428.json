I have an ESA. ESA status gives you the right to have an animal in your own home not the ability to take it anywhere you want.", "YWNBTA. Personally, I think the ESA needing to go everywhere with her is extreme. Emotional support animals don\u2019t have the same training that a service animal would, you don\u2019t know how the animal will react in your space and you\u2019ve only just reconnected with this person. When there\u2019s a new animal you don\u2019t know, you should always be cautious! Not necessarily suggesting the ESA would be dangerous. It could just be that you don\u2019t know if they have certain behaviors that could cause damage to your home/belongings. In my experience, nervous owners can create nervous animal behavior. Find a different place to meet. Advocate for your own animals being nervous around dogs if there\u2019s pushback. No reason to start issues that could lead to ANY of these animals being put in a bad position where they may act out.", "NAH.  But instead of her coming to yours, why not go to a cafe for coffee or something then she can bring her dog no problem.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She\u2019s proven before that her pets are untrained and misbehave.

Her dog helps her, but it\u2019s just not gonna work in your home. She may just want to bring her dog as a precaution or she may feel genuinely unsafe, so this would be a great compromise.

True service animals aren't just trained for the service they provide to their owners. They are trained to exist in the world without disturbing it when their vest is on. It's why they are so expensive. ESA'S are normal pets that's are well behaved enough and provide their owners necessary comfort. Or more commonly, they are just owners pets that are nice but not necessary, or even more commonly owners bought the vests off amazon in order to justify taking their ill behaved pets where they arent allowed. Which they can't if it's an ESA. If you don't want her at your place meet at a coffee shop. If she insists on your place say that your cats won't take kindly to a dog so if she can't leave her dog you'll have to meet somewhere else.", "NTA.

Don't make it sound like you're trying to separate her from the dog, take your place out of the equation", "NTA.  You should also check your lease.  An ESA for you in your apartment is a legal accommodation.  A friend's is not. It is considered a pet. You may not be allowed to have a visitor's ESA in your home because the animal is not YOUR ESA. I've heard of people having problems with the management because they allowed someone with an ESA into their apartmeCafe.\n\nShe probably knows this already.  \n\nThis is a perfectly valid reason to tell her why her dog is not allowed.  Offer to meet at her house or a dog friendly cafe."]}
