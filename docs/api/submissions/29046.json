{"id": 29046, "submission_id": "1795wxb", "title": "AITA for wanting my brother to give me away at my wedding instead of my father?", "selftext": "This is dumb, but here we are.  \nI (26F) have a\u2026 strained relationship with my parents to say the least. They weren\u2019t necessarily abusive, but they were neglectful and overly critical of me when I was a kid. They kept me dry and fed and made sure I got treatment when I was sick or injured, but for the most part, that was it. Mom and Dad kind of ignored me for the most part unless I did something they disapproved of.  \nThe one looking out for me was my older brother, who I\u2019ll call Dave (36M). Dave was always there when I needed anything. He read bedtime stories to me, helped me with my homework, drove me to my first date, etc. Just about any basic human abilities you can think of, I probably learned from him. I even went to live with him when I was 14. Dave never had custody of me, but Mom and Dad never tried to get me to come home, so on all accounts, that hardly matters.  \nI officially went No Contact when I was 19 and they tried to make me change my College Major, but during the pandemic, my Mom sent me an email. My Dad had COVID and it seemed like we might lose him for a bit, though he managed to pull through. It put things into perspective for them and she asked to speak with me. I agreed, and the two apologized to me and acknowledged they treated me badly. I didn\u2019t trust it then, but they respected my boundaries, all four of us went to family therapy together and we\u2019ve slowly built a better relationship over the last three years.  \nWhich brings us to now. My fianc\u00e9 Max (27M) and I are getting married in spring. For probably obvious reasons, I want Dave to walk me down the aisle and give me away. Our parents have some opinions on that. My Dad somehow just expected to be the one to do it and when I told him that that\u2019s not what\u2019s gonna happen, he thought I was kidding. I told him I wasn\u2019t and he got sad, but I think accepted it.  \nThen my Mom learned about it. And she kind of went off on me. She told me that having my brother give me away is inappropriate and that she thought we were over me \u201cholding a grudge\u201d over their mistakes. I told her that I\u2019m not holding a grudge at all, but that I\u2019m also certainly not going to forget how they treated me. Besides, Dave was more of a parent to me when he was barely a teenager than either her or my Dad, which I also pointed out is majorly fucked up. My Mom again accused me of holding it against them and then I told them that Dave is going to give me away, end of story, and if they have a problem with that they can just stay home that day.  \nMax is entirely on my side, probably because he was around before and during my family\u2019s reconciliation, so he\u2019s more than aware of how important Dave is to me. Dave on the other hand has told me to just let Dad do it because he doesn\u2019t want to cause drama. I told him he isn\u2019t. They are. He still thinks I should let our father do it just so the wedding day can go off without a hitch.  \nSo, am I the asshole for wanting my brother to walk me down the aisle?", "created_utc": 1697462710, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1795wxb/aita_for_wanting_my_brother_to_give_me_away_at_my/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It makes perfect sense to have your brother walk you down the aisle! But your special day is likely to be overshadowed to some degree by the buzz among your guests.

A concession because you want to, and it reflects your feelings and healings are beautiful - but doing it just to shut them up sets a terrible precedent. \nAnd make no mistake: embarassment about how ithers will perceive them when they don't do these things is a part. Will your mom be joining for traditional mother of the bride activites?\n\nYour parents are allowed to have feelings about not having the traditional parent of the bride moments, they are allowed to respectfully talk to you about it (that could be healing, too), but your mom was way out of line to make a fuss.

You were basically raised by your brother and are finally trying to work through the issues of how you were raised these past years as an adult.   Its sad to be sure that your parents chose not to be parents to you and you simply do not have that bond.   Your mother needs to stop creating drama and accept that you simply do not see your parents as true parents and your brother is the parent that they never were.  \n\nQuestion: How was your brother raised?
