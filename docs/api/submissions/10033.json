A few people have also mentioned \u201calternative\u201d childcare options - please do state what you mean by that, in case it\u2019s something I didn\u2019t consider or wasn\u2019t at all aware of. If you mean siblings, none of them are able to provide childcare for longer than a weekend and they\u2019re all child-less, so we don\u2019t feel comfortable leaving our son in their care.\n\nTL;DR Her parents are retired and in good health, but won\u2019t take our kid for longer than a weekend. My parents are willing to take him for a week, but my mum has a slipped disc and my Dad has chest issues. I don\u2019t want to leave our child with my parents.\n\nMy wife and I went to Las Vegas for our honeymoon in 2016 and always agreed that we\u2019d go back for our 5th anniversary. We ended up not going in 2021 due to Covid restrictions and didn\u2019t last year due to money. This year, we are financially able to go but there\u2019s childcare to consider.\n\nHer parents are retired and in decent health, but aren\u2019t willing to take our son for longer than a weekend. That\u2019s fine, it\u2019s not their child and they\u2019re allowed to enjoy their retirement, I have no argument against their wishes.\n\nMy parents both work, but are very willing to take him for a week. My mum is a college teacher, so it\u2019d be off-term and my dad is self-employed so he normally moves his hours around whenever we visit or if our son stays with them for a few days.\n\nProblem is, my mum has recently been diagnosed with a slipped disc in her back. The dr is going to give her an injection and everything might be ok, but it\u2019s also possible that she might need surgery to fuse vertebrae. My dad has also been having chest issues and had x-rays the other day. I\u2019ve been telling him for over a year to go to the dr and ask about getting an inhaler (my mum and I got out about a year ago), so it could be as simple as that for him.\n\nThey\u2019re NHS patients in the UK, so it\u2019ll take a while for my mum to get her injection (and even longer if she needs something after that) and for my dad to get the results from his x-ray (and even longer if he needs something after that). So odds are that they\u2019ll still be struggling with their health come holiday time (nothing booked, but our anniversary is in May).\n\nI feel a great need to protect my parents and not add to their already-existing back/chest pains by dumping a child at their home for a week. Personally, I want to cancel our holiday plans and wait indefinitely (no idea how long it\u2019d take for my parents to recover, or even if they will in the first place).\n\nWife wasn\u2019t thrilled when I said I wanted to put the holiday on hold and wanted me to ask my parents more about whether they\u2019d be willing to have him and if they thought they\u2019d have all their injections and tests done in time. I\u2019d rather leave them alone and not put pressure on them with all this.\n\nAm I overreacting? Am I overthinking? Am I a bad husband?

You could even ask a trustworthy friend to do it. You could even ask a trusted neighbor to just be available in case of emergency.

Plan A can be your parents, *(edited: my original plan B involved splitting up time between parents but you\u2019ve explained that would be incredibly difficult) Plan B could be her parents or sibling(s) each taking him for a few days. You can even offer to hire a nanny for them so they don\u2019t have to be fully responsible, but he\u2019s not spending a week with a stranger.

You could offer to pay. That way they aren\u2019t falling behind on studies. I worked pretty much full time during  college so I would think this would be doable and take some pressure off your parents. Also, maybe asking a friend to take child to nursery and picking up a few days? I\u2019ve watched my 2 nephews for a week a few times and didn\u2019t mind. It was exhausting but I did it for my niece. If you go to Vegas, i recommend the full day tour to Hoover dam, the Grand Canyon and Route 66. It is absolutely amazing!! Good luck and I do hope you get to go.", "I was about to give the same advice: take your kid with you and arrange for child care in Vegas.

I'm still limber and functional until I get this shooting pain on the lower left side towards the end of my golf swing follow-through. Anyway, there's a procedure now where, depending on the pain causing nerves function, the doctors can go in and cauterize said nerve in a way that stops it from sending the pain signal to the brain. I actually learned about this from Michael Bisping, speaking of the UFC. My understanding about the fusion procedure is that once you get one vertebrae fused, the ones above and below will be soon to follow. They also have artificial disks they can insert, too. Backs suck once they decline.", "For a slipped disc, yeah - I got the injection and it didn't work for more than a week or two, so I ended up getting a laminectomy, where they clip off the bit of the disc that's obstructing the nerve.

Your wife is selfishly thinking about her vacation. \n\nIt's best not to leave an energetic 5 year old with someone who has back issues, depending on where and how severe the disk is constricted, chasing around/picking up/physically assisting a child could exaggerate her pain.

Is there somewhere closer to home you'd enjoy to shorten the trip and be closer to home in case of emergency?\n\nOtherwise, you can travel as a family and hire a sitter as needed in Las Vegas.
