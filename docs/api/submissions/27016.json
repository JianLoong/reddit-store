I think a proposal should be tailored to both people, like your favorite place, where you met, or something like that, but that's me.  If my partner proposed on a jumbo tron or did some elaborate flash mob (I know those aren't a thing now but SuperStore is on in the background), that would be clear to me that this person had never actually met me before.  LOL", "NTA. Just because you\u2019d like for it to be a memorable/meaningful occasion, doesn\u2019t make you shallow.  While I think lots of people go totally over the top nowadays, a nice dinner isn\u2019t too much to ask.", "A nice dinner and actual ring aren\u2019t too much to ask. NTA", "I don\u2019t really understand the whole notion of a proposal.  Shouldn\u2019t getting married be something the couple discusses and agrees upon and once they do agree they are then engaged?  That\u2019s what my wife and I did.  After that I went and got her a nice ring.", "NTA. There's nothing wrong with wanting a nice proposal. I can't stress enough that this doesn't always mean it has to be extravagant, it really just depends on what your preferences are as a couple. There's nothing wrong with wanting a nice dinner or evening as part of your proposal, and there's nothing wrong with wanting a more low key proposal either.", "NTA. There is nothing wrong with wanting him to put in a little effort to propose. Based on your post and comments, you're not asking for a $30K ring given to you at the Eiffel Tower on New Years Eve or anything. Dinner and a ring = a low bar. Seems like a good bare minimum.", "NTA. Your expectations are very reasonable. It's weird and a bit alarming that he's making such a big deal out of a very basic request. \n\nYeah yeah yeah, proposals don't matter much in the grand scheme of things but your partner's ability to care about what makes you feel good very much *does*.", "NTA - you\u2019re setting your standards and expectations. I\u2019ve never heard of a no-ring proposal\u2026The meal I get too but is your bf shy?

This is important to you so it should be important to him. OTOH, you either love him and want to spend your life with him, or you don't. From his point of view, maybe he was just seeing if you love him enough not to care about such things.\n\nI see both sides.", "At least he didn't propose while you were taking a dump like in the other post lol", "NTA. But I had to laugh.  My son proposed at the end of a day he and his now wife had spent the day together.  Sitting on their sofa.  She said \u201cthis has pretty much been a perfect day.\u201d  He pulled the ring out and asked her if that would make it more perfect.  Totally spontaneous.  He had a plan to ask her a month later while they were on vacation in Colorado.  Had the perfect spot picked out.  That all went out the window when she said what she said.", "God I wish it were possible to give people the perspective of just how unimportant proposals and weddings are.

And what if you went through with it and he said no because it wasn't good enough? I get that people watch too many disney princess movies and sappy love stories and it's a big deal to them, which is whatever, but to me if my partner laid out expectations for a proposal I would probably second guess my decision to propose. This question probably wasn't him trying to get your permission to do this at home lol he was probably just seeing what your answer would be and might  have been a little disappointed. NTA for wanting that because I know it's important to some people, but I'm still curious if you would ever consider proposing or buying him a ring.", "Actually I think he\u2019s shallow.  There is certain amount of tradition and ceremony involved with marrying, and for good reason \u2014 it connects us to the past and future, and symbolizes commitment.

And what if it's spontaneous? \n\nAnother question is what if he wants a proposal? Would you do it? Would you be hurt if he told you no for any reason?", "I'm going to say NTA, because you're entitled to your preferences. I think your preferences are a bit silly, but you're free to have them.\n\nSo here's my opinion: if you propose to someone, and it's a surprise, then you're an asshole. Marriage is something that requires mature reflection and commitment - nobody should be surprised or put on the spot by a proposal.\n\nSo given my preference that an official engagement flows naturally from an ongoing series of discussions between the couple, making a big deal about asking the question is silly, because both of you should know what the answer will be.\n\nHaving a special celebration of your engagement, on the other hand, seems eminently reasonable. I'd say the majority of women I know preferred to shop for their engagement ring, rather than being presented with something that their partner chose. So for me, a no-ring proposal is better. But you're entitled to other preferences.\n\nBut the fact that your bf thinks you're shallow for your preferences does raise questions about whether you two are compatible.", "NTA but he might be testing you. It sounds like you are making the effort to change country and live with him, you might want to ask yourself how much level of effort he's going to invest in your relationship.", "In my opinion, if you love and care for each other, getting married shouldn't have anything to do with having a ring when proposing or not. I think what is important is to demonstrate that he loves you, cares for you and want to be with you, just that. He can demonstrate that through other ways than a nice dinner or buying a ring. If you don't want to marry him because of just a ring or a dinner, then it looks somehow shallow.\n\nI'm between YTA or NAH, not sure.\n\nEdit: I think NAH. Even if you only wanted to marry him if he bought a ring, that's the type of relationship you want to have. It is shallow, but it doesn't make you an AH.", "I think that it's shallow. What does your love and devotion to each other have to do with a ring and fancy dinner? If you won't accept him without the trappings, maybe you should question whether or not you love him. He hopefully is asking himself the same thing right now. That would be a huge red flag for me.", ">I\u2019m not asking for anything crazy, just don\u2019t propose to me at home in your sweatpants. AITA\n\nYou have a right to your opinion. I would be running for the hills. You sound high maintenence", "ESH, but not in a huge way. On him, if he\u2019s going to marry you, he should know you well enough to know that you wouldn\u2019t want something so simple. On you, do you want to marry him, or do you just want the perfect experience?", "No. A proposal can be a huge deal to people. Some people prefer a more low-key one due to preferences, but you're allowed to also want the opposite.\n\nIt should please whoever is being proposed to, so their partner really has to know them. If the proposal isn't what they wanted, it can show lack of communication and understanding and the marriage wouldn't hold up.\n\nIt's not shallow, being proposed to is one of the biggest questions to ask people. If someone wants to be proposed to in a certain way, it's just their preference.\n\nI personally prefer it if the engagement was special, so I understand you. You just want a little more effort and that's totally fine. Idk why his mind jumps to \"shallow\" when being engaged is a massive step up from dating.\n\nI'd like something special for mine that has lots of consideration. I technically wouldn't say no, but I'd want the engagement night to be associated with the happy memories of that night", "NTA for stating what you want, but you do seem a bit materialistic, especially if you'll refuse a proposal to someone you want to spend the rest of your life with just because they don't have a physical token of their intent at hand.", "You are not an AH, just shallow.", "NTA. If my husband had proposed me without a ring just out of the blue, I would have said no. To me, an engagement ring is a lot more than just a pretty piece of jewelry. Marriage is a life time commitment! It\u2019s a promise between the two of you that you\u2019ll be there for each other, as partners,  through good and bad, no matter what. It is a huge decision that should never be taken lightly or done on a whim. To me, a man going out to purchase a ring tells me that he understands *exactly* what marriage is and is taking that commitment seriously. People don\u2019t put that sort of effort or money into something they\u2019ve only taken two seconds to think about before making a decision. A proposal should be tailored to the couple, but effort should still be made there, it shows again that he\u2019s taking it seriously. And it is serious, he\u2019s asking you to spend the rest of your life with him! There should be some effort made there.", "NAH. I don't think either of you are. You just have different opinions on something, which is perfectly fine.", "I have an idea. In an age of gender equality, how about you propose to him?", "If your love and willingness to be with someone for decades hinges on your impression of a proposal, maybe you should propose?

Your bf asks you to marry him and you\u2019d say no if you didn\u2019t think he put in enough effort?  How much effort is enough?  It seems to me you\u2019re more concerned with the proposal than the marriage.  If you really loved your bf, you\u2019d say yes no matter where he proposed and no matter what he was wearing.", "How much are you expecting him to pay for a ring?", "YTA. You're ultra shallow.", "YTA Why don't you set up the proposal?  You can write the script, so he says exactly what you want to hear?

Obviously, you would not be happy with anything he picked out.\n\nYour BF is right, you are shallow.\n\nAdvice to BF:  Run.", "Nta if you do the proposing.\n\nYta if you expect him to..  \n\nHow about this?

IF he is smart man this is what his answer will be... proposal 15k, wedding 150", "YTA.\n\nWhat kind of big, spectacular event are you going to create to ask him to marry you? \n\nNothing, right?

Because you are owed this thing?\n\nYou both make good money, no reason you can't buy him  ring, right? (Sound familiar?)\n\nI've heard women say that they're not agreeing to marry him until \"I get \\*my\\*ring\", as though an expensive ring is some kind of inalienable right.\n\nYou're being the asshole.

He just asked and then we went back inside. I said yes because I love him and wanted to marry him, but honestly as time passed I got more and more resentful of his low effort proposal. His mom's ring wasn't anywhere close to what I liked (we had even looked at rings together and he asked me what I wanted). Everyone asked me how he proposed and I didn't have a story to tell, and everyone acted like that was so sad. Plus I felt cheated because I'd daydreamed about him proposing for months and I thought he'd at least put a little thought into it. \nAll this to say, keep your standards.

Some conversations need to be had regarding this and future milestones events, communicate that having a special something prepared makes you feel appreciated and see if he can accommodate to the best of his ability.\n\nIf he makes effort but still not up to your standard, I say appreciate the thought nonetheless. You know him better. You know whether he's romantic or keen on organizing special things or a great gifter, etc. Can you still communicate your standard? Of course. I suggest over time like in passing show him what a nice birthday dinner looks like, mention your favorite restaurant, things like that.", "NTA\n\nThere should be some effort put into it, especially if you communicated that", "I think that's a mild ESH situation. I'm more of the \"hey, what do you think, I guess it's time we got married\" person. It has dignity and seriousness. But when one of a couple expressed the wish to wish to celebrate the occasion with a meal and a conventional token, and the other doubles down with \"nah, not me!\" then it's a bad sign. On the other hand, expecting a male partner to stage a whole surprise rigamarole is really tacky. \n\nThe couple agreeing they want to get married and then have a private proposal celebration at a restaurant, with ring, should work for both sensibilities in a couple that communicates well.", "You want what you want. If he doesn't propose to your liking tell him No, not with a proposal like that.

Is he not supposed to have his own expectations?\n\nBut honestly, it might be a cultural thing. There are so many things much more important.

It gives you a new insight into their character and it is valid to not want to get married anymore.", "It's not shallow. Bc it's not about the spectacle. A proposal at home with no ring is so low effort. Do you even want to marry me? Or marry at all? This is the person you want to be your life partner and you can't be bothered to make it a little special? Nah.", "No. The person is asking you to spend the rest of your Life with them. It should be a special, thought out occassion demonstrating how much they love you and why.  It is not a transaction. If it is low effort or just no effort, that is not proving to the other person how much you love and care for them. Unless that is what the other person wants. Sweatpants in the home.

It's like someone's birthday. Some people like to pick our their own present for others to buy, some want it a thoughtful surprise. And one could argue that it shouldn't matter either way and expecting anything is shallow. But this is important to OP, and it doesn't sound like she's asking for anything outlandish.

He didn\u2019t say anything about marrying though, so I played dumb for a bit to mess with him. \n\nMarrying the person you supposedly love is WAY more important than \u201cwell how/when/where you asked wasn\u2019t what I wanted!\u201d  It\u2019s like people who care more about the wedding than the marriage. This isn\u2019t the important part. We\u2019ve been together for almost 10 years, and married for 7 (were engaged for a couple years before actually getting married). Is the perfect proposal seriously more important to you than marrying your partner? So much so that you would say no? That just seems ridiculous.", "Ours was at the kitchen table. Kind of an \u201cok, let\u2019s do this\u201d moment. 25 years and don\u2019t see that changing.", "NYE in Times Square is no one\u2019s dream. It\u2019s gross and crowded and everyone has to pee.", "Why not? Some weird gender roles?", "Also, that's a lot you gave up for him, so I see where you're coming from", "Wait, you\u2019re moving countries and taking this huge pay cut and you\u2019re not sure whether you want to commit to him? That seems backwards. What if he does get the proposal wrong and you have to undo all those huge changes you\u2019re making for him?", "Are you sure you really want to do this?", "You are giving up a lot by moving there. If I were you, I\u2019d want to be more certain about my future with him rather than waiting for a special proposal. \n\nI got married a long time ago, and I\u2019m not sure if any of my friends received a proposal. It was more about decisions we made as couples. It\u2019s been more than 30 years, and we\u2019re all still married. My husband and I were talking about our future and decided to get married. We picked out a ring, set a date, and moved forward. He did put the ring on my finger and asked me to marry him.\n\nMy husband can be very romantic, and through the years he\u2019s made grand gestures as well as small ones. But I\u2019m also a feminist, so the implications of waiting for a man to propose concern me. It sends the message that men are in control of the relationship and the direction it takes, rather than it being a mutual decision. However, if you want this proclamation of your boyfriend\u2019s love, I hope he proposes to you in a way that makes you happy. \n\nI wish you the best.", "What in the 1950\u2019s?  Why would you never propose?", "Okay, that does buy you some points lol but say you lived in the same city to begin with, would you ever propose to a guy and buy a ring? \n\nAlso, I'm not trying to trick you here or argue for no reason lol I'm just generally curious. I know some people want this perfect proposal and some don't. This answer from a partner would send me  packing, but for some guys I know they couldn't wait to plan a big elaborate proposal. Then again, I have a friend who proposed at the top of his wife's favourite mountain and she still found things wrong with it and has never been happy with a single thing he's done lol not saying that's you, just saying some people need more and some people are never happy and some people are perfectly happy with a tv dinner proposal haha", "Right, this strikes me as a lot of game playing. If you want to marry someone, you say yes when they ask you, then iron out any aesthetic details later. If you\u2019re not sure whether you want to marry someone, you shouldn\u2019t say yes because they got the aesthetics of the proposal right.", "His job is much better than mine in every way. So I quit my fairly decent job, and moved 2,000 miles away from my family and friends, and the state that I was born in and had lived my entire life. I up rooted my life and moved to the other side of the country just to be with him. Five months before I met my husband, I told my mother that I would never leave my home state, that I would live and die there and that nothing in the world would ever be important enough to make me leave. I think that was proof enough about how serious i was.", "Hmm well I\u2019m not sure I believe you when you say you don\u2019t know about ring cost. I\u2019m sure if he proposed with a simple and pretty $500 ring, you might get upset. \n\nAlso for the record, my husband never proposed and I got a mountain bike as an engagement \u201cring\u201d. We\u2019ve been married for 7 years and happily. No one ever remembers or cares about the proposal.", "Let's not act like tradition is not a thing", "Haha she did! They've been married for 9 years this October.", "Im sorry but there is no greater laugh then when you laugh so loud that your dog is like WTF just happened!", "It\u2019s gross that the treatment leading up to the proposal can mean less than the proposal itself. Might be one reason why so many marriages fail.", "Right, but discussion isn\u2019t the same as picking out something you have to wear every day.", "When He proposed me with that $20 Amazon ring, we were laying in bed watching movies at 3am and I had food poisoning. I still said yes.", "So if he\u2019d moved, you wouldn\u2019t have required him to buy you a ring?", "Idk, I'm with OP on this one, I'd be offended by a whatever proposal but I don't give a shit about ring cost as long as it's pretty and doesn't turn my finger green. I'd be stressed about losing an expensive ring, but the memory of a romantic proposal is something I never have to worry about misplacing. \n\nEveryone has their own preferences. OP isn't asking for anything huge here.", "This just isn\u2019t true. I mean I\u2019m glad you are happy with your bike but most people remember and care about their proposal. My ex husband was very blas\u00e9 about it and that should have been a warning sign for me. I want a man who is thoughtful of what I want, not one who tries to convince me I\u2019m a dumb little brainwashed princess.", "\ud83d\ude01", "If the treatment leading up to the proposal does not match the proposal then what exactly is going on?? If someone treats you well and then at the proposal it is low or no effort, then there is a disconnect and is a redflag. However if you have always accepted low or no effort in the relationship and receive a low or no effort proposal, then you get what you have always accepted. \nHaving standards on how you are treated is not a bad thing. You do not have to accept low or no effort people.", "I forgot to mention, the first ring my husband proposed to me with was a plain band he got off Amazon for $20. I still said yes. It wasn\u2019t about the money, it was the thought and the symbolism of what that ring represented. And, no, I wouldn\u2019t have required him to buy me anything.", "Nah, OP has to set their expectations low. Anything else is shallow. In fact, they should have no expectations ever. Birthday? Nah, expecting things is shallow. Christmas, Valentine's? Nope. Shallow. /s", "If low or no effort is now someone is consistently treated, then the conditions of the proposal are moot anyway. \n\nWhat about spontaneous expressions of love?  The moment catches him and he tells her he wants to marry her. If you truly love the person and say no because you view that as low effort, do him a favor and say no.", "That\u2019s\u2026 not the same as what you said in your first comment in this sub thread.", "OP needs to cater to HIS expectation to not do anything nice for her ever.  /s", "Right? It\u2019s pretty crazy that people call women shallow for wanting a man who shows he cares about her and then turn around and call women stupid for being with men who treat them like garbage. I am proudly high maintenance, I\u2019m not going to lower my standards just because someone can\u2019t or doesn\u2019t want to meet them lol.", "Spontaneously says wants to marry her? She would be a fool to say yeas. He needs to think about it really well not just blurt it out the first time it popped into his head."]}
