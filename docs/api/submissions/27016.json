He is uncomfortable with moving to the US because he doesn\u2019t want to leave his family behind, so I am moving to him. I will be leaving my friends and family behind, and also taking a 40k pay cut to be with him. I am a nurse in the US and nursing doesn\u2019t pay as well in Canada. I\u2019m not proposing to him. It\u2019s not a competition over who does more for the relationship, but I need to see some effort on his part. \n\nHe also wouldn\u2019t like that I\u2019m proposing because he would think it\u2019s weird that the woman is doing it and not the man", "created_utc": 1694898477, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ki3uw/aita_for_saying_i_dont_want_a_low_effort_proposal/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think a proposal should be tailored to both people, like your favorite place, where you met, or something like that, but that's me.

LOL", "NTA. Just because you\u2019d like for it to be a memorable/meaningful occasion, doesn\u2019t make you shallow.  While I think lots of people go totally over the top nowadays, a nice dinner isn\u2019t too much to ask.", "A nice dinner and actual ring aren\u2019t too much to ask. NTA", "I don\u2019t really understand the whole notion of a proposal.  Shouldn\u2019t getting married be something the couple discusses and agrees upon and once they do agree they are then engaged?  That\u2019s what my wife and I did.  After that I went and got her a nice ring.", "NTA. There's nothing wrong with wanting a nice proposal. I can't stress enough that this doesn't always mean it has to be extravagant, it really just depends on what your preferences are as a couple. There's nothing wrong with wanting a nice dinner or evening as part of your proposal, and there's nothing wrong with wanting a more low key proposal either.", "NTA. There is nothing wrong with wanting him to put in a little effort to propose. Based on your post and comments, you're not asking for a $30K ring given to you at the Eiffel Tower on New Years Eve or anything. Dinner and a ring = a low bar. Seems like a good bare minimum.", "NTA. Your expectations are very reasonable. It's weird and a bit alarming that he's making such a big deal out of a very basic request. \n\nYeah yeah yeah, proposals don't matter much in the grand scheme of things but your partner's ability to care about what makes you feel good very much *does*.", "NTA - you\u2019re setting your standards and expectations.

This is important to you so it should be important to him. OTOH, you either love him and want to spend your life with him, or you don't. From his point of view, maybe he was just seeing if you love him enough not to care about such things.\n\nI see both sides.", "At least he didn't propose while you were taking a dump like in the other post lol", "NTA. But I had to laugh.  My son proposed at the end of a day he and his now wife had spent the day together.  Sitting on their sofa.  She said \u201cthis has pretty much been a perfect day.\u201d  He pulled the ring out and asked her if that would make it more perfect.  Totally spontaneous.  He had a plan to ask her a month later while they were on vacation in Colorado.  Had the perfect spot picked out.  That all went out the window when she said what she said.", "God I wish it were possible to give people the perspective of just how unimportant proposals and weddings are.

And what if you went through with it and he said no because it wasn't good enough? I get that people watch too many disney princess movies and sappy love stories and it's a big deal to them, which is whatever, but to me if my partner laid out expectations for a proposal I would probably second guess my decision to propose. This question probably wasn't him trying to get your permission to do this at home lol he was probably just seeing what your answer would be and might  have been a little disappointed. NTA for wanting that because I know it's important to some people, but I'm still curious if you would ever consider proposing or buying him a ring.", "Actually I think he\u2019s shallow.  There is certain amount of tradition and ceremony involved with marrying, and for good reason \u2014 it connects us to the past and future, and symbolizes commitment.

Would you be hurt if he told you no for any reason?", "I'm going to say NTA, because you're entitled to your preferences. I think your preferences are a bit silly, but you're free to have them.\n\nSo here's my opinion: if you propose to someone, and it's a surprise, then you're an asshole. Marriage is something that requires mature reflection and commitment - nobody should be surprised or put on the spot by a proposal.\n\nSo given my preference that an official engagement flows naturally from an ongoing series of discussions between the couple, making a big deal about asking the question is silly, because both of you should know what the answer will be.\n\nHaving a special celebration of your engagement, on the other hand, seems eminently reasonable. I'd say the majority of women I know preferred to shop for their engagement ring, rather than being presented with something that their partner chose. So for me, a no-ring proposal is better. But you're entitled to other preferences.\n\nBut the fact that your bf thinks you're shallow for your preferences does raise questions about whether you two are compatible.", "NTA but he might be testing you. It sounds like you are making the effort to change country and live with him, you might want to ask yourself how much level of effort he's going to invest in your relationship.", "In my opinion, if you love and care for each other, getting married shouldn't have anything to do with having a ring when proposing or not. I think what is important is to demonstrate that he loves you, cares for you and want to be with you, just that. He can demonstrate that through other ways than a nice dinner or buying a ring. If you don't want to marry him because of just a ring or a dinner, then it looks somehow shallow.\n\nI'm between YTA or NAH, not sure.\n\nEdit: I think NAH. Even if you only wanted to marry him if he bought a ring, that's the type of relationship you want to have. It is shallow, but it doesn't make you an AH.\n\nEdit 2: I don't understand why I get negative karma.", "I think that it's shallow. What does your love and devotion to each other have to do with a ring and fancy dinner? If you won't accept him without the trappings, maybe you should question whether or not you love him. He hopefully is asking himself the same thing right now. That would be a huge red flag for me.", ">I\u2019m not asking for anything crazy, just don\u2019t propose to me at home in your sweatpants. AITA\n\nYou have a right to your opinion. I would be running for the hills. You sound high maintenence", "ESH, but not in a huge way. On him, if he\u2019s going to marry you, he should know you well enough to know that you wouldn\u2019t want something so simple. On you, do you want to marry him, or do you just want the perfect experience?", "No. A proposal can be a huge deal to people. Some people prefer a more low-key one due to preferences, but you're allowed to also want the opposite.\n\nIt should please whoever is being proposed to, so their partner really has to know them. If the proposal isn't what they wanted, it can show lack of communication and understanding and the marriage wouldn't hold up.\n\nIt's not shallow, being proposed to is one of the biggest questions to ask people. If someone wants to be proposed to in a certain way, it's just their preference.\n\nI personally prefer it if the engagement was special, so I understand you. You just want a little more effort and that's totally fine. Idk why his mind jumps to \"shallow\" when being engaged is a massive step up from dating.\n\nI'd like something special for mine that has lots of consideration. I technically wouldn't say no, but I'd want the engagement night to be associated with the happy memories of that night", "NTA for stating what you want, but you do seem a bit materialistic, especially if you'll refuse a proposal to someone you want to spend the rest of your life with just because they don't have a physical token of their intent at hand.", "You are not an AH, just shallow.", "[deleted]", "NAH. I don't think either of you are. You just have different opinions on something, which is perfectly fine.", "I have an idea. In an age of gender equality, how about you propose to him?", "If your love and willingness to be with someone for decades hinges on your impression of a proposal, maybe you should propose?

Your bf asks you to marry him and you\u2019d say no if you didn\u2019t think he put in enough effort?  How much effort is enough?  It seems to me you\u2019re more concerned with the proposal than the marriage.

You're ultra shallow.", "YTA Why don't you set up the proposal?  You can write the script, so he says exactly what you want to hear?

He just asked and then we went back inside. I said yes because I love him and wanted to marry him, but honestly as time passed I got more and more resentful of his low effort proposal. His mom's ring wasn't anywhere close to what I liked (we had even looked at rings together and he asked me what I wanted). Everyone asked me how he proposed and I didn't have a story to tell, and everyone acted like that was so sad.

I'm more of the \"hey, what do you think, I guess it's time we got married\" person. It has dignity and seriousness. But when one of a couple expressed the wish to wish to celebrate the occasion with a meal and a conventional token, and the other doubles down with \"nah, not me!\" then it's a bad sign.

It should be a special, thought out occassion demonstrating how much they love you and why.  It is not a transaction.

It's like someone's birthday. Some people like to pick our their own present for others to buy, some want it a thoughtful surprise. And one could argue that it shouldn't matter either way and expecting anything is shallow. But this is important to OP, and it doesn't sound like she's asking for anything outlandish.
