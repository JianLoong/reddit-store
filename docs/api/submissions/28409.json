He is married to Cathy (F) for 6 years, they have a 4 year old. About a week ago, Cathy came to my house tell me John had been acting distant and was coming home late. She didn't saying he was cheating on her with me but she implied it. I was surprised because the whole girl BSF has never been an issue to her and I've stated many times we are basically siblings. I said I hadn't talked to him in a few days and she said to let her know if I contacted him.\n\nA few days later John came over unannounced with a worried look. He said he was a terrible person. I invited him in, prepared for him to tell mer he was a cheater. But no, he said he was gay. I was shocked to say the least. I gave him the generic \"I support you\" because didn't know what to say. He said he had been \"experimenting\" at gay bars because he has had this feeling for awhile now.\n\nHe continued to say he wasn't telling Cathy and I said it wasn't a good idea. He had he didn't want his daughter to grow up with divorced parents like he did. I said it was wrong, but he made me promise not to tell her he just needed to tell someone.\n\nTwo days ago, Cathy invited me to coffee. I felt horrible as I lied to her saying I didn't contact John. She then called me a liar and I thought she somehow knew he was gay. But no, she called me a homewrecker because she saw John's car. I denied. I knew I just had to tell her because she was bawling and I couldn't do it anymore. I told her that John was gay and told me to keep it a secret. She didn't believe me at first, but then I told exactly what he told me and I guess it lined up to to the excuses he had been telling her. I let her cry as we took a walk outside. I felt like I did the right thing and she thanked me for telling her.\n\nJohn found out that evening and screamed at me asking how could I. I said it was wrong to keep this from her. He said that I ruined his life. I haven't talked to John or Cathy since. I told another friend of mine and she called me an asshole for outing him, so AITA?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1696667628, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1721b1p/aita_for_outing_my_best_friend/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because now it's not his secret that he's struggling with, it's a secret you BOTH have to keep. F that!\n\nHe's exposing his wife to all kinds of risks and diseases due to his selfish actions. You did the right thing. \n\nNtA.. not even a little bit.\n\nHe doesn't get a pass for cheating just because he's doing it with a man.", "NTA. Gay man here, generally it's not ok to out someone. However it's also not ok to cheat on someone and then stay with them while knowing your gay. John never should have put you in that position and you did the right thing here. If John wants to pretend to be straight and play happy married straight families for the rest of his life that's fine, but he has to actually commit to pretending. He ruined his own life here. If your in a monogamous relationship you aren't allowed side chicks no matter what your sexuality is.", "NTA - She needed to know, it was unfair for John to tell you that and expect you not to tell his wife and just bottle it all up. She has every right to know, if he isn't going to tell her so she can stop living a lie, you can", "NTA - you were caught in the middle of a crappy situation that had been caused by other people. You tried to navigate it and it all blew up because people tend to shoot the messenger.  Whether you decided to keep John\u2019s secret or not, it is *John* at fault here for deceiving his wife, not yours.  If he is gay then he shouldn\u2019t have got married, if he has \u2018only just realised\u2019 then he shouldn\u2019t have been cheating on his wife with other men. And now that he has realised, he has to admit it to his wife or he is cruelly keeping her in the dark when she actually needs to be free to move on and live her life.  Commentators passing judgement on you about whether or not you should say something are being unrealistic about how life is full of shades of grey - you had only just found out and you were put on the spot by Cathy. Honestly I cannot see any way you could have navigated that whole bin fire of a situation. Best thing to do is to give them time and space to sort it out between them - it is their problem after all. NTA", "Nta\n\nAt the point you told her, you were literally being accused of being a homewrecker and so directly dragged into the whole saga. You did the right thing.", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't out him to the public, you just spared his poor wife many years of lying and suffering.\n\nNothing wrong in being gay, totally wrong keeping up a fake marriage while cheating just because you don't want your kid to have divorced parents.\n\nThat's the ultimate bullshit btw cause if my dad had done something like that to my mom I'd definitely hate his guts now.", "I mean... NTA for spilling the beans... dude told you a giant secret that he should have kept to himself... you did your best not to reveal it, but you were basically ( figuratively) attacked by his wife into revealing it...\n\nThis is all on him... he's blaming the messenger here... he put you in an unfair position...\n\nThat being said:\n\n*\"He continued to say he wasn't telling Cathy and I said it wasn't a good idea. He had he didn't want his daughter to grow up with divorced parents like he did. I said it was wrong...\"*\n\nYou going along with this was super shitty and makes you an AH... hopefully, this was just the short term idea, because it was NOT a long term solution... hell, it wasn't even a **1 WEEK** solution, given you spilled the beans two days later...\n\nSo, NTA for revealing the truth, **under the circumstances**... but YTA for planning to help keep this a secret...\n\nEDIT: Think I misunderstood, that you were planning to help keep the secret... if you weren't, then NTA...", "NTA What else were you supposed to do after she saw his car at your house? Admit to an affair you weren't really having? He's mad at you for getting caught but he got himself caught cheating so, I mean, divorce was inevitable. She had already noticed he wasn't at home when he was supposed to be home. You didn't cause it.", "NTA: those of you saying YTA are ridiculous. The man is CHEATING it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s with men or women, his wife doesn\u2019t deserve to be with a husband who doesn\u2019t love her. Outing someone is not acceptable other than in the situation, because of the party member being effected\u2026 His wife. You did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nHe is a cheater. He wouldn't be able to keep up what he was doing for 16 more years anyway. Having divorced parents is better than living in a house built on lies and resentment.", "NTA, if he's experimenting with other people, he's putting her health at risk.

He\u2019s an asshole for lying to his wife and sneaking around behind her back. Whether he\u2019s gay or straight, he\u2019s a crappy husband!", "NTA at all wtf. John is", "So he cheated with men. Great he figured out his sexuality but you still did the right thing here. He could have given her a STD. She could have wasted years with a man who may or may not leave once the kids grew up. So much was not ok here and she even thought maybe he was cheating with you. He needed to come clean and he wasn't going to. Good on you for making it right.", "ESH\n\nCathy shouldn't have involved you and appearently stalked you or her husband just sketchy.\n\nJohn shouldn't have cheated and then involved you. He was having a crisis and feelt obliged to share with whom you yourself said have a sibling bond. \n\nYou for breaking that bond and promise to John instead of just telling Cathy to talk to her husband and stepping out of this mess.\n\nYou have now lost your friendship with John. Cathy is likely not going to look at you kindly being the bearer of the bad news and that is likely gone as well. You fucked up. You should have just pushed both of them back from involving you in this mess.", "YTA\n\nYou could\u2019ve admitted that he was there but nothing happened between you two which is the truth. Even if she didn\u2019t believe you she would have to go home back to John where he would have to do the explaining and decide whether he wants to come out or not.", "YTA. You promised you wouldn't tell and you did. The fact that it was such a huge secret makes it only worse. \nAfter she said that she saw his car, you could have told her that yes, he was there but it's not what she thinks and she needs to talk to him.  \n\nYou threw him under the bus because you didn't want to seem like the bad guy. I understand that it's heartbreaking to see her cry and that you want to come clean, but it was not your call to make. \n\nHe didn't have enough time to sort through his own feelings and thoughts, and now he will have to sort that out while dealing with her grief, worries and questions about the future.", "I mean yeah, you are the asshole. You at least could have explained it better to him because you just wrote you told her because she deserved to know. When before you made it sound it happened more by accident.\n  \nI even agree she deserved to know but this is none of your business.", "YTA. A huge one, actually.\n\nThe golden rule is the following: you don't meddle between two spouses, never. \n\nBy telling your friend's wife that your friend is cheating on her (it does not matter whether he's having sex with a man, a woman or a unicorn), you obtained two results:\n\n1) You destroyed your friendship.\n\n2) You destroyed his marriage.\n\nIn cases like this, you simply meet your friend again, and tell him \"look, your wife is pressing me, don't put me in an awkward spot\", CERTAINLY you don't confess IMMEDIATELY everything. Not only everyone will now look at you as someone unreliable, you will also be remembered as the one that told his wife about his sexual tastes when he made huge offert to confess this to someone. You are really the worst friend I can possible think of.\n\nMind your own business, always.", "YTA. You shouldn't have said anything. That was for him to tell, given the circumstances you should have told her to ask him.\n\nIf there was any chance of him making things right is some way, you destroyed them.", "ESH - Outing people is potentially very dangerous. Never do it.\n\nYou could have said that he said he was cheating without disclosing that part of it.\n\nJohn is an AH for stringing his wife along, obviously.", "Eeek. This is difficult. \n\nESH. Coming out is a big deal and should be at the will and timing of the individual. You took that from your friend. Yes, he was dishonest in his relationship with his wife, but it was not your news to deliver.", "YTA. Coming to grips with his sexuality is a hugely difficult thing, and now not only is he struggling to accept himself, hes struggling with his family falling apart and losing his 'best friend.' Which you are not, btw. You were more concerned with how you appeared to cathy in the moment than what john has been going thru.", "NTA this was not your battle it was his. It's not fair to Cathy to be with a man who has no interest in her. She should be allowed to heal and find her husband. John dig his own grave.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your place to tell your bf\u2019s wife anything. You should have told her that she needs to work out this issue with him. That you love them both, but you can\u2019t be in the middle of their relationship. It was not your place to out your bf to anybody.", "I feel for John, I really do. But he cheated on his wife. He exposed her to who knows what STIs without her knowledge or consent. And as for his plan to just not tell his wife his feelings and a fundamental aspect of their marriage had changed, any hurt he's trying to avoid now will only grow worse the longer it takes for his secret to come out. And it will.   \nCathy needed to know.  \nNTA", "Diseases? Where do you come from? The middle age?", "Where does it say he cheated or fucked it said he experimented going to a gay bar bc u know the atmosphere is going be different from a regular bar", "Sorry but it\u2019s really morally wrong to be in a straight relationship when you know you\u2019re gay pretending or not (unless your wife knows and you have an agreement). They could be with someone who actually loves them instead of wasting years of their life with someone who can\u2019t. It\u2019s a cruel cruel thing to do, it\u2019s not women\u2019s jobs to provide kids or be beards for men. If you do it knowingly that\u2019s awful", "Exactly! Stay away from other peoples problems", "What, and let john lie? You sound like the type of person who'd turn a blind eye if your friend was cheating on someone because it's \"not my business\"", "How is it not? She knows, now it's her business", "OP was literally thrown into the middle of this. Was being called a home wrecker over it. I think both OP and the best friend are both AHs here but it kinda became OP\u2019s business when both parties dragged OP into it. The wifes life was a lie and the best friend expected OP to allow him to keep his wife in a fake marriage for possibly ever? Until the kid grew up? Until he found someone else? And OP outed their best friend. All around terrible situation", "He ruined their friendship and the minute he started screwing around with other people, he destroyed his marriage. Your response is such a weird take on the matter and oddly specific. He should\u2019ve been honest with his wife rather than dragging others into it.", "This. Why does everyone want to get involved in other people's marriages?  How horrible for Cathy to know that he trusted this very private part of himself with OP but not her.", "Gay man here, disagree. You never out someone because it's never their business what someone elses sexuality is. But the second your in a relationship and you decide to cheat you lose the right to remain closeted.", "I\u2019m sorry, but if a married friend confronts me in hysterics while screaming at me for being a home wrecker and cheating with her husband and I know that he\u2019s actually been gallivanting around gay bars behind her back (and won\u2019t tell her the truth), what he\u2019s been up to becomes my news to deliver. \n\nIf that makes me a bad person, so be it, but I\u2019m not going to fall on the sword to cover up someone else\u2019s lies and bad behavior. I\u2019m also not willing to jeopardize someone else\u2019s sexual health because her husband is a cheating cad.", "When other people's lives hinge on your sexuality, you've lost the right to choose when and if you come out.", "John shouldn\u2019t have cheated on his wife then. He could have came to terms with his sexuality without hurting the person he married, but he threw that all out the window the moment he decided to cheat on her.", "STDs do exist in this modern age believe it or not", "Oof\n\n If you think stds aren't a real concern, then you need to go have a talk with your health provider...\n\n Married couples very often don't use protection during sex. if one partner is going outside the marriage (with any sex), they can get a disease and bring it home to the non-cheating partner. \n\nThis is a very big deal for the wife, and she deserves to know. \n\nOP, if you see this you're NTA.", "STDs aren't only for straight people sex. Gay sex can give you a STD too.....", "The wording was that \"he has been \"experimenting\" at gay bars\", which strongly implies physically cheating, not \"experimented going to a gay bar\".", "How do you know if he would lie after he was confronted after the wifes visit to OPs home? At least you agree that it\u2019s not OPs business.", "He?", "She became involved when Cathy accused her of cheating with John - this jeopardizes OP\u2019s reputation when they did nothing wrong. Cathy deserves to know that her husband is cheating on her - gay or not. John should\u2019ve been upfront about what\u2019s going on, he is simply experiencing the consequences of his actions. Even if you take the sexuality aspect out of the equation, you still have a married man unsatisfied in his marriage, going to bars that make him feel less tied down, to scope out potential affair partners and even possibly future spouses. If you are having trouble with your identity and your marriage, go to therapy.", "The cheating husband decided to include OP in his business, and the wife should have been told she was potentially at risk of getting STDs", "Because he said he would never tell his wife.", "No I don't agree. I'm saying your that type of person to think that. A cheater is everyone's business. Every person who knows and doesn't say something is an enabler.", "Sorry, misread, corrected it", "Well if your best friend is having an identify crisis you should be supportive not go behind his back and tell his wife lol", "Can't both be true? You can support your friend while also acknowledging his wife has a right to know", "I mean just because you think she deserves to know, does this mean you have to go behind your guys back? I dont think so. If anything you could encourage him to come out.", "The idea you would tell a friend before the woman who thinks you love her and who you are married to is just wrong, OP was right to tell her rather than wait to encourage him or see if he would, she deserves to know as soon as possible", "That would again be a thing between you and your partner. \n  \nNow the whole situation is messed up for all 3 and nobody trusts each other anymore."]}
