Sometimes people don't like each other. At least you were honest. I'd give him a pass for social anxiety or something akin to that, but \"I don't care\" is a horrific response to someone trying to befriend you.", "NTA- he is TA if anyone is. sure perhaps you didn\u2019t need to go at him like that; i myself would have said something more like \u201cyou\u2019re not much of a talker are you? i\u2019m just trying to get to know you and make you feel welcomed. i won\u2019t be offended but please do let me know if i am asking more questions than you want to answer.\u201d or something similar to that. he sounds like an absolute weirdo though. feminist? eh maybe. probably more like he just wants to tell women what he thinks they want to hear. the way i have always seen it is that for me to be with you, my friends need to like you and you need to respect them. and when i say my friends need to like you, they would need actual valid reasons to not like you. they can kick rocks if they have dumb reasons, but if they are legitimate and valid reasons, it would be a no for me.", "NTA. Someone else can explain it to you for me.", "NTA. Sometimes you just have to call a spade an f-ing spade. S is just blind because she likes him (God knows why). You are more objective. You tried to be nice and engaged him into conversation, but he acted like a giant d bag. Might as well say the truth than being forced to spend time with him again.", "NTA. He was being rude. You pointed that out. He didn\u2019t like it but that\u2019s not your concern. You weren\u2019t mean, you were matter-of-fact.", "NTA. \n\nThat feminist line actually made me chuckle.", "NTA he was rude and dismissive, to the people saying \u201cbe kind\u201d for what!?! He was a prick and you told him so. He didn\u2019t deserve any kindness, you get what you give.", "Nta, idk if he's on the spectrum, sheltered, or just plain rude, but he just had a valuable life experience. No one's probably ever told him that he's unlikable, so that might prompt him to work on his social skills and not say out loud that he \"doesn't care\". Try not to beat yourself up, I'm sure you're a decent person. Not every interaction with people has to be fake and overly polite, no one learns or grows that way. It's like letting someone walk around stinking, and no one ever telling them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Clearly the boyfriend was being rude, I'll give you that, but it was also rude of you to say what you said so bluntly. At anytime you could have just excused yourself and that would have been it.\n\nTo be honest I am a very blunt person, and I would have said the same thing or something similar along the lines to what you said but even sooner into the conversation. The day I learned not to care about what others feel about me is the day I really came out of my shell.
