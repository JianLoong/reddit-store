Sometimes people don't like each other. At least you were honest. I'd give him a pass for social anxiety or something akin to that, but \"I don't care\" is a horrific response to someone trying to befriend you.", "NTA- he is TA if anyone is. sure perhaps you didn\u2019t need to go at him like that; i myself would have said something more like \u201cyou\u2019re not much of a talker are you? i\u2019m just trying to get to know you and make you feel welcomed. i won\u2019t be offended but please do let me know if i am asking more questions than you want to answer.\u201d or something similar to that. he sounds like an absolute weirdo though. feminist? eh maybe. probably more like he just wants to tell women what he thinks they want to hear. the way i have always seen it is that for me to be with you, my friends need to like you and you need to respect them. and when i say my friends need to like you, they would need actual valid reasons to not like you. they can kick rocks if they have dumb reasons, but if they are legitimate and valid reasons, it would be a no for me.", "NTA. Someone else can explain it to you for me.", "NTA. Sometimes you just have to call a spade an f-ing spade. S is just blind because she likes him (God knows why). You are more objective. You tried to be nice and engaged him into conversation, but he acted like a giant d bag. Might as well say the truth than being forced to spend time with him again.", "NTA. He was being rude. You pointed that out. He didn\u2019t like it but that\u2019s not your concern. You weren\u2019t mean, you were matter-of-fact.", "NTA. \n\nThat feminist line actually made me chuckle.", "NTA he was rude and dismissive, to the people saying \u201cbe kind\u201d for what!?! He was a prick and you told him so. He didn\u2019t deserve any kindness, you get what you give.", "Nta, idk if he's on the spectrum, sheltered, or just plain rude, but he just had a valuable life experience. No one's probably ever told him that he's unlikable, so that might prompt him to work on his social skills and not say out loud that he \"doesn't care\". Try not to beat yourself up, I'm sure you're a decent person. Not every interaction with people has to be fake and overly polite, no one learns or grows that way. It's like letting someone walk around stinking, and no one ever telling them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Clearly the boyfriend was being rude, I'll give you that, but it was also rude of you to say what you said so bluntly. At anytime you could have just excused yourself and that would have been it.\n\nTo be honest I am a very blunt person, and I would have said the same thing or something similar along the lines to what you said but even sooner into the conversation. The day I learned not to care about what others feel about me is the day I really came out of my shell. If your friend S cant understand why you said what you said given the circumstances I'd personally feel that's a friendship not worth saving. \n\nSo again, I'd say both of you are the \"asshole\" in this situation but I don't blame you at all lmao.", "honestly ESH\n\nyou really didn't have to say anything to a person you've just met, you could've just ended the conversation and moved on.\n\nhe didn't have to act as a prick, but it kinda seems to me that he didn't want to talk to you from the beginning. like the two of them were likely on a date, he was intending to have some personal time with his gf and was super not excited when there were suddenly other people involved.\n\nand if my assumptions are correct, then S also sucks for inviting you to join them in the first place.", "[deleted]", "ESH you don't know if there is a reason why he is like that, he might be socially anxious for example, and he might be fine when you on own him better.  \n\nYou both were rude.", "YTA. Not much nuance to this one.", "Why bother commenting then lol", "Same on all of the above.", "I agree this is probably what was going on\u2026 he didn\u2019t sign up to spend half an hour being interrogated by gf\u2019s friends, but was just trying to enjoy a date", "But was he not being rude at first by being dismissive of them and acting like they weren\u2019t there? Op could have been nicer and just left but didn\u2019t give him the right to act that way and op didn\u2019t have to be nice to someone who wasn\u2019t nice to them", "I\u2019m not even COMMENTING on the comments, I\u2019m going to get that person over THERE to explain it to the *mumble grumble ooh, I am so above all this mumble stare into middle distance, scratch arse*", "Woosh", "Nta and I particularly find it rude and obnoxious when people say I don't care to a topic of conversation that doesn't interest them. It's something a child would do.\n\nI've had people talk to me about things I've no interest in like sport or their job but I be polite and sociable and feign interest. It's called being an adult. \n\nI wouldn't have said \" I don't like you though\", I might have just called him out on his manners and said \" sorry you are being pretty rude and I find your manner pretty inappropriate , is there a problem?\"", "NTA. I know some girls think it's cute when you're with a guy who's an asshole to everyone but you, but when you're with a guy like that, he's just an asshole and the mask will come off soon enough. Usually not soon enough to keep your friends and family from being pushed away, though.\n\nIf by some chance Sam is not an asshole, he's got the personality of a bucket and can't even be bothered to try for his girlfriend. I'm sure she deserves better! I'm saying this as someone who has social anxiety and can still manage to be polite.", "Nta. He was being unlikable", "NTA. When you guys were taking about stuff he literally said \"I Don't Care\" that's so f***ing rude.", "NTA...you just said what you thought. Some people just don't have the skills to deal with directness.", "NTS. Why can he be rude but you can\u2019t? Equal opportunity!", "He was clearly not interested in talking to you, for whatever reason. Personally I don't think the reason matters, and all that matters to you is he didn't want you there or want to talk to you to the point of being antagonistic. He was being a massive AH about it and wasn't even trying to hide it. You and your friend should have made an excuse and got out of there, not to appease his AH attitude but to stop wasting your own time. You could have later talked to S about it and figure out what was going on if you wanted to clear it up. Why would you stick around and try to force him to engage in conversation for 30 minutes when the situation is like that?", "Here\u2019s a weird one, maybe your friend told her BF about some times when the friend group had falling outs or maybe she told him about the not so pretty side of the friend group and he\u2019s judging based off that? Not sure but if all he\u2019s ever heard we\u2019re bad things, he\u2019s going to make a bad impression.", "With out a doubt he was a jerk. He was the one most at fault.\n\nAnd to your credit you did the best you could. But you should not have said you don\u2019t like him. You need filters. You can\u2019t say what you want all the time.", "I mostly stuck around because of S. She really obviously wanted the 3 of us to interact and I didn't think that her bf would be so against it, though I see now I should have probably just left", "It confused me too but I realised its a joking reference to how the boyfriend made S answer questions addressed to him (fave video game etc) for him. Reading tone through text is hard for me too sometimes", "It did come off as a little rude which I'm sure you didn't mean. This is what I hate about social media I have to just read the words, I can't hear the intended tone or infer from body language \ud83d\ude2b", "\"agree this is probably what was going on\u2026 he didn\u2019t sign up to spend half an hour being interrogated by gf\u2019s friends, but was just trying to enjoy a date\"\n\nEh that's life, people might join in a social setting or group you are part of who you  don't know or knew would join. Unless they are being obnoxious, you be polite and converse with them. Don't be so obtuse to think it's socially acceptable to sit and huff and be blatantly rude towards them because you don't want them there or you don't know them.\n\nI used to have tea with a colleague who was a close friend, another eccentric colleague who annoyed us both would sometimes sit beside us but we'd be polite and include her because we are adults and not 12 year old bullies. Again it's called being an adult. Likewise I used to go visit a friend and sometimes the parents would join us, I'd be there to see the friend and not them but I'd still be courteous and polite to them and involve them in the conversation. \n\nAlso they hardly interrogated him, they simply reached out to him and made him part of the conversation. Asking people about their interests/ hobbies is not interrogation, it's standard social etiquette and perfectly acceptable to do in a conversation. Asking him about his sex life or something else inappropriate like his dating history would be interrogation.", "Thanks for explaining it, I really was confused lol idk why I got so many downvotes", "That\u2019s why I added the \u2018lol\u2019 but I think that might\u2019ve made it worse.. yeah I struggle with tone too \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
