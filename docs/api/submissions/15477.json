It's called being an adult and having some integrity and respect towards others. I worked with a colleague who'd often show me pics of her children and grandchildren, I'd no interest but she loved telling me about them so why would I be a dick and tell her I didn't care? She meant no harm so I'd smile and nod along and engage with her.\n\nI wouldn't have said \" I don't like you\"  though.  I might have just called him out on his manners and said \" sorry you are being pretty rude and I find your manner pretty inappropriate , is there a problem?\" \n\nKill them with kindness like that and assertiveness rather than become inflammatory yourself because then they are the ones who look stupid and unjust whilst you look mature and on moral high ground.

Equal opportunity!", "He was clearly not interested in talking to you, for whatever reason. Personally I don't think the reason matters, and all that matters to you is he didn't want you there or want to talk to you to the point of being antagonistic. He was being a massive AH about it and wasn't even trying to hide it. You and your friend should have made an excuse and got out of there, not to appease his AH attitude but to stop wasting your own time. You could have later talked to S about it and figure out what was going on if you wanted to clear it up. Why would you stick around and try to force him to engage in conversation for 30 minutes when the situation is like that?", "Here\u2019s a weird one, maybe your friend told her BF about some times when the friend group had falling outs or maybe she told him about the not so pretty side of the friend group and he\u2019s judging based off that?

Reading tone through text is hard for me too sometimes", "It did come off as a little rude which I'm sure you didn't mean.

Unless they are being obnoxious, you be polite and converse with them. Don't be so obtuse to think it's socially acceptable to sit and huff and be blatantly rude towards them because you don't want them there or you don't know them.\n\nI used to have tea with a colleague who was a close friend, another eccentric colleague who annoyed us both would sometimes sit beside us but we'd be polite and include her because we are adults and not 12 year old bullies. Again it's called being an adult. Likewise I used to go visit a friend and sometimes the parents would join us, I'd be there to see the friend and not them but I'd still be courteous and polite to them and involve them in the conversation. \n\nAlso they hardly interrogated him, they simply reached out to him and made him part of the conversation. Asking people about their interests/ hobbies is not interrogation, it's standard social etiquette and perfectly acceptable to do in a conversation. Asking him about his sex life or something else inappropriate like his dating history would be interrogation.", "Thanks for explaining it, I really was confused lol idk why I got so many downvotes", "That\u2019s why I added the \u2018lol\u2019 but I think that might\u2019ve made it worse.. yeah I struggle with tone too \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "ESH.

Either way, I think there's another side to it that I want to hear.", "Sounds like a introvert met extroverts and it didn't go well. When I met my husband's friends they all said I was stuck up or a b***ch.

Our family is not wealthy. Try to have a normal, friendly conversation with him about anything and he gets a pained look on his face so we've learned just to politely say hello when we see him and good-bye when we part company and he's happiest with as limited interaction as possible.\n\nI have a really good friend who is a doctor. Her sister married into a wealthy family. The friend says when she meets extended members of the family of her sister's inlaws, they first check out your jewelry and shoes/clothing. If you're not wearing expensive stuff, they greet you politely then have no further interaction with you. Don't care who you are, what you do or what you have to say.\n\nMaybe the fruend's bf is wealthy and extremely class conscious.", "NTA. \n\nI think either your friend S is an AH or that rude ass BF is the AH. I see 2 scenarios here, 1. The BF is shy/introverted/has social anxiety or something like that and your friend S put him in a spot where the whole situation went horribly wrong, 2. He's just plain rude and actually doesn't care about his GFs friends.\n\nEither way, you tried to have a conversation, and ended up not liking him and didn't hide the fact. Maybe next time he meets you he'll be better prepared (if it's reason 1, if its reason 2 I think you're better off not meeting him again imo)", "Sounds like u were just rude back in response to him being beyond rude... I dont think u were an a-hole, but 'technically' rude back. Not that it wasn't TOTALY justified. I personally think u showed restraint lol. And ur friend needs to grow the hell up and realise what they're getting in to here.\n\n I'm guessing this due is either rich? Very good looking? Or ur mate has very low self esteem? Or something along these lines??

I feel bad for your friend. When they break up she\u2019ll come back, try not to be too mean to her. A lot of girls make this mistake, hopefully your still young and she can learn from this relationship", "Yta because you (and your friends) kept bothering someone who clearly wasn't into it.

Hopefully your friend sees this too but he might think again before behaving like that because of you, OP. It was needed", "This dude sounds like he's in low-key crisis", "NTA but is it possible that he didn't speak the language?

Brutally blunt, but given how he was acting, that\u2019s incredibly fair!", "ESH - not sure who more so, because I would need a few details first.\n\nIs he on the spectrum? My bf is on the spectrum and gets *SUPER* shy around new people and can come off like an ass. (I\u2019ve been told this by one of my brothers.) In order for him to feel comfortable enough to really converse, he needs time to warm up to people (more than a few min or an hour). In the mean time, his answers are super short or noncommittal and I end up doing most of the talking for him. Like it took him *years* to initiate or even participate in long conversations with my mom, and she has always been super nice and really likes him.  It took him years to be comfortable around my friends, and now they\u2019re also his and he talks quite a bit when he\u2019s with them.\n\nYou went straight for the jugular instead of confronting the problem like an adult and seeing if the issue was just miscommunication/misinterpretation or if he really was an asshole.

It seems like there\u2019s pretty strong \u2018I don\u2019t like you\u2019 vibes, dude.\u201d That way you can make a more reasonable judgement on his mindset instead of just **assuming**.) Judgmental people like you are the reason my bf (and perhaps people like him) are so damn shy. Also, notice how he **never** confronted you? Even though you were super rude to him, he didn\u2019t say anything and it was his partner that confronted you later? Maybe he\u2019s not as awful as you think.\n\nNow he may be on the spectrum/super shy or he may just have been an uppity ass, I really don\u2019t know.

Did the BF have some obligation to give long-form answers to satisfy OP?  Did the BF give any indication that he was interested in being friends?\n\nI'm not saying the BF was a paragon of social grace, friendliness or maturity, but generally speaking in life, when someone pretty clearly wants to be left alone, it's a decent idea to just leave them alone.\n\nI'm leaning towards **YTA** for badgering and judging the BF, OP.  Nobody said y'all have to make friends with each other at first sight.", "Depends on the topic.

What if he developed more healthy coping strategies? The world would be a better place. I admire OP for not sitting on the fence.", "Yeah, exactly. It seems that 95% of people commenting so far are teenagers who think that their opinion is the most important thing in the world.

If he still can't find words then move on. It's no one's loss. The GF can better help bridge the gap. And while I don't see the point in saying \"wow, I don't like you\" I can understand the frustration.", "Is there any chance that he was purposely trying to get you guys to dislike him so he could push her away from you?", "I'm on the spectrum. I'm either masking in conversations or not talking much because masking is exhausting. Spectrum or not, there is zero excuse for saying \"I don't care\" in response to your partner's friends trying to get to know you or making your partner talk for you because you don't give a damn.", "Zero idea, never even crossed my mind that it'd be a possibility that he was being like that on purpose to be manipulative or something", "You got downvoted for not understanding the joke, plain and simple.", "Well if you read the whole post, it was a pretty obvious jab at the AH bf.", "It\u2019s easy when you know someone.
