It's called being an adult and having some integrity and respect towards others. I worked with a colleague who'd often show me pics of her children and grandchildren, I'd no interest but she loved telling me about them so why would I be a dick and tell her I didn't care? She meant no harm so I'd smile and nod along and engage with her.\n\nI wouldn't have said \" I don't like you\"  though.  I might have just called him out on his manners and said \" sorry you are being pretty rude and I find your manner pretty inappropriate , is there a problem?\" \n\nKill them with kindness like that and assertiveness rather than become inflammatory yourself because then they are the ones who look stupid and unjust whilst you look mature and on moral high ground.

Personally I don't think the reason matters, and all that matters to you is he didn't want you there or want to talk to you to the point of being antagonistic. He was being a massive AH about it and wasn't even trying to hide it. You and your friend should have made an excuse and got out of there, not to appease his AH attitude but to stop wasting your own time. You could have later talked to S about it and figure out what was going on if you wanted to clear it up. Why would you stick around and try to force him to engage in conversation for 30 minutes when the situation is like that?", "Here\u2019s a weird one, maybe your friend told her BF about some times when the friend group had falling outs or maybe she told him about the not so pretty side of the friend group and he\u2019s judging based off that?

Reading tone through text is hard for me too sometimes", "It did come off as a little rude which I'm sure you didn't mean.

Unless they are being obnoxious, you be polite and converse with them. Don't be so obtuse to think it's socially acceptable to sit and huff and be blatantly rude towards them because you don't want them there or you don't know them.\n\nI used to have tea with a colleague who was a close friend, another eccentric colleague who annoyed us both would sometimes sit beside us but we'd be polite and include her because we are adults and not 12 year old bullies. Again it's called being an adult. Likewise I used to go visit a friend and sometimes the parents would join us, I'd be there to see the friend and not them but I'd still be courteous and polite to them and involve them in the conversation. \n\nAlso they hardly interrogated him, they simply reached out to him and made him part of the conversation. Asking people about their interests/ hobbies is not interrogation, it's standard social etiquette and perfectly acceptable to do in a conversation. Asking him about his sex life or something else inappropriate like his dating history would be interrogation.", "Thanks for explaining it, I really was confused lol idk why I got so many downvotes", "That\u2019s why I added the \u2018lol\u2019 but I think that might\u2019ve made it worse.. yeah I struggle with tone too \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "ESH.

Our family is not wealthy. Try to have a normal, friendly conversation with him about anything and he gets a pained look on his face so we've learned just to politely say hello when we see him and good-bye when we part company and he's happiest with as limited interaction as possible.\n\nI have a really good friend who is a doctor. Her sister married into a wealthy family. The friend says when she meets extended members of the family of her sister's inlaws, they first check out your jewelry and shoes/clothing. If you're not wearing expensive stuff, they greet you politely then have no further interaction with you. Don't care who you are, what you do or what you have to say.\n\nMaybe the fruend's bf is wealthy and extremely class conscious.", "NTA. \n\nI think either your friend S is an AH or that rude ass BF is the AH. I see 2 scenarios here, 1. The BF is shy/introverted/has social anxiety or something like that and your friend S put him in a spot where the whole situation went horribly wrong, 2. He's just plain rude and actually doesn't care about his GFs friends.\n\nEither way, you tried to have a conversation, and ended up not liking him and didn't hide the fact. Maybe next time he meets you he'll be better prepared (if it's reason 1, if its reason 2 I think you're better off not meeting him again imo)", "Sounds like u were just rude back in response to him being beyond rude... I dont think u were an a-hole, but 'technically' rude back. Not that it wasn't TOTALY justified. I personally think u showed restraint lol. And ur friend needs to grow the hell up and realise what they're getting in to here.\n\n I'm guessing this due is either rich? Very good looking? Or ur mate has very low self esteem? Or something along these lines??

It was needed", "This dude sounds like he's in low-key crisis", "NTA but is it possible that he didn't speak the language?

Brutally blunt, but given how he was acting, that\u2019s incredibly fair!", "ESH - not sure who more so, because I would need a few details first.\n\nIs he on the spectrum? My bf is on the spectrum and gets *SUPER* shy around new people and can come off like an ass. (I\u2019ve been told this by one of my brothers.) In order for him to feel comfortable enough to really converse, he needs time to warm up to people (more than a few min or an hour). In the mean time, his answers are super short or noncommittal and I end up doing most of the talking for him. Like it took him *years* to initiate or even participate in long conversations with my mom, and she has always been super nice and really likes him.  It took him years to be comfortable around my friends, and now they\u2019re also his and he talks quite a bit when he\u2019s with them.\n\nYou went straight for the jugular instead of confronting the problem like an adult and seeing if the issue was just miscommunication/misinterpretation or if he really was an asshole.

It seems like there\u2019s pretty strong \u2018I don\u2019t like you\u2019 vibes, dude.\u201d That way you can make a more reasonable judgement on his mindset instead of just **assuming**.) Judgmental people like you are the reason my bf (and perhaps people like him) are so damn shy. Also, notice how he **never** confronted you? Even though you were super rude to him, he didn\u2019t say anything and it was his partner that confronted you later? Maybe he\u2019s not as awful as you think.\n\nNow he may be on the spectrum/super shy or he may just have been an uppity ass, I really don\u2019t know.

Did the BF have some obligation to give long-form answers to satisfy OP?  Did the BF give any indication that he was interested in being friends?\n\nI'm not saying the BF was a paragon of social grace, friendliness or maturity, but generally speaking in life, when someone pretty clearly wants to be left alone, it's a decent idea to just leave them alone.\n\nI'm leaning towards **YTA** for badgering and judging the BF, OP.  Nobody said y'all have to make friends with each other at first sight.\n\n**EDIT**:\n\n> Politely excusing yourself from a social situation isn\u2019t a Herculean task.\n\nDon't you get it?  For some people, it \\*IS* an Herculean task.  Some people have bad social phobia.  Some people are having a physically or emotionally crappy day.  Some people are spaced out.  Some people simply don't have the modest social skills to meet strangers, be polite, and beg off further interaction.  Some people are very cagey about opening up right away.  Some people are torn up about something or other, and just not in a place to chat & meet.  The point is-- **you don't know if you just met them**.\n\nThe adult thing to do would be to back off, file it away, maybe talk to the GF about it later, see what happens next time, etc.  By badgering and judging the person on the spot, I maintain that **YTA**.\n\n**EDIT2**: Folks, in future, may I suggest the following question early in the conversation-- ***Oh, are we bothering you?***\n\nYou know why that's such a gem?  Because it recognises that the person is being apart, and it gives them their space to either open up, explain if there's an issue, or distance in a healthy way.  EITHER WAY, it's an improvement upon you wasting your time asking them questions and them wasting their time deflecting.  Cheers, mateys.", "Depends on the topic.

O.O", "I'm a introvert and would be miserable in the situation you described. I am hella awkward when put into social situations. People have said that going on dates with me is like going on a business interview, I'm that awkward.

But no he\u2019s not a jerk", "I'm not sure what you don't understand about the idea that being apathetic and dismissive when someone you care about is trying to introduce you to someone is in fact rude. OP didn't walk up to a stranger and hold him down.\n\nEverything about his behavior, even as you describe it says \"this isn't worth my time\". It is rude to treat others that way. Especially when they're actively trying to be kind to you. Do you really think OP organically gave a crap about talking to this guy? That he was just inherently with her time? No, she gave a crap because her friend wanted her to.\n\nHow you respond to other's bids for social connection is a reflection on your character. Dude showed he didn't want to bother with OP, so OP didn't like him. There are polite ways to get out of conversations you don't want to be in without radiating disdain for others.", "YTA. You were rude.", "NTA. I don't like him either.", "INFO: Why does he have to have some GD disease?

Since it was the first time meeting him, a text/convo w her after would\u2019ve been the best move. They could\u2019ve just gotten into an argument/fight which put him in a very bad mood or he could be very antisocial to the point he seems rude/like he\u2019s better. IMO he sounds like he\u2019s just an AH & I also wouldn\u2019t like him but just for your friends sake - a private convo about this would\u2019ve been best!

Of course, 99% of the time that isn\u2019t the case, and people just suck. But 1% of the time, it\u2019s something else. \nBased on what you\u2019ve written here, it sounds like there wasn\u2019t something else going on. But on the off chance that he just got scary medical news, or he just discovered a sibling was going to prison, or he has some traumatic memory associated with whatever show or thing you guys were talking about, I don\u2019t think you should have said what you did. \nHe\u2019s your friend\u2019s boyfriend, but he\u2019s also a stranger. Sure, seems like he was kind of a dick, and maybe you avoid him in the future, or mention it to your friend later. But there\u2019s no benefit to making him feel worse if he does happen to be in a bad place.", "NTA. Her boyfriend is.", "Hmmmm\u2026.ESH..no, NTA. Usually best to not come right out with the statement you did. He is a major major AH, don\u2019t let him bring you down to his level. Also, I suspect he was going for a reaction and he got it. Being ignored would have really gotten to him.\ud83d\ude01\n\nIf you had not said it to his face but just told your gf what you thought of him, she\u2019d still call you TA.", "ESH- what would it have cost you to just be nice?  Or to politely excuse yourself from the conversation and leave?\n\nYou don't ever have to spend time with this guy again.  Of course you don't like the guy, and for good reason.  But no reasonable non-AH just volunteers how much you don't like someone in a conversation.  You can't just vocalize every thought you have.", "So he's what exactly, a non misogynistic asshole?\n\nNTA but very close to being one to yourself. I'd have left far sooner than a half an hour of that sort of torture.", "Exactly. I've had a lot of social struggles esp when I was younger, and I could very much see someone get really thrown off by being thrown into a social situation where they had no warning or prep time and they were the lone outsider to the group. I could see them freezing up, only giving one word answers, and leaning on their partner to carry the conversation. I could maybe see them deflecting some questions away from them out of being scared to be the center of attention.\n\nThe \"I don't care\" statement is just unnecessary, hurtful, and arrogant", "\"good afternoon.

I may not have said it but I sure would have thought it.", "NTA - if that's the worst thing you said to him you have more restraint than I do. I wouldn't be able to pretend to converse with him for more than a couple minutes before I told him to stuff his attitude where the sun don't shine.

Imo, it sounds like he wanted to be as unpleasant as possible because he wanted S alone. May wanna check in with her if he has a pattern of trying to isolate her.", "Honestly, I would say ESH.\n(and sorry for my english)\n\nYes, from what you described, he sounds like an AH.\n\nThe problem is that pretty much no one act like that without a reason.\nMaybe one of you said something that hurted him and he tried to withdraw from the conversation because of that ? Maybe it really wasn't a good timing because they had a conflict and S invited you anyway, breaking the conversation they had ? Maybe he was on the verge of panicking and could only let out some short answer without realizing the impact of his speech on you ? Etc.\n\nEither way, when someone seems angry at you and/or totally close to the conversation, you don't just try to force the conversation for 30 mins straight, wtf. You could have ask if you said something wrong, or if he was feeling ok, or let them in peace and ask later to your friend what happened exactly, etc. But not only did you try to force on him something that he obviously didn't want, but you attacked him right after because he didn't want to.\n\nLet's make things clear, that doesn't save him from being an AH in that situation, but clearly, you acted with a lack of maturity and you were an AH too. From what I can see, you are both very young and have a lack of communication.\n\nThe other thing that I have a problem with is that you obviously tried to manipulate us into agreeing with you. \n- You didn't write what he said, you wrote an interpretation of what he could have think to make him look even more bad : ''he made S talk FOR him and not in a \"I don't know what to say so please take the reigns\" way, but in an almost \"they are beneath me\" way.''. \n- On the other hand, you try to make us think that you're a good person with comment like '' I try my best generally to include everyone in a conversation''.\n\nI mean... stick to the facts. It's normal to not be perfectly neutral, but here, it really makes me think that there's something even more fishy and I think that the reality should be a lot different than what you described.\n\nAnyway, ESH.(and YTA if you made him looks more bad than what he really did)", ">After around 30 minutes of trying \n\nYou gave about 20 minutes too many when someone clearly, clearly, did not wish to engage with you.

In fact my guess is the boyfriend was extremely not happy with this.  Maybe he hates getting new people sprung on him.  Maybe he was expecting him and his girlfriend to have alone time.  Truthfully in the post it sounds like the boyfriend shut down and disengaged.  He sounded mad.  I would be to if my partner who I was supposed to be having a date with suddenly pulled in two others with out checking in with me, and then proceeded to spend all our time with them.  My answers would probably get shorter and shorter.  I would have even left.\n\nI do vote the friend S TA.

I get S really wanted the three of you to interact, but was this okay with the boyfriend?  It sounds unplanned.  And that he probably had objections to it and was put in a uncomfortable position and was angry and trying to deal with it.  Even though he didn\u2019t do it great.  At least he did not blow up at her.  Also wondering why he did not leave? Maybe he was her ride or she was his.\n\nPut yourself in his position.  You\u2019re on a date with your SO and they all the sudden spring friends on you that you haven\u2019t planned on meeting, and invite them to join you for your date.  And ignore your feelings about the situation.  It didn\u2019t sound like he wanted to be with you three.  Maybe he wanted to be with S, but not you.  I\u2019d be mad and upset and wouldn\u2019t want to talk.  I would however leave and go home, and it wouldn\u2019t matter to me if I was there ride or not.

She can\u2019t see that he may have a legit reason for being short with them other then being an A H.  And a lot of people posting think he\u2019s trying to separate S from her friends and not that S can be the A H here.  Hopefully all parties see the thread and see how they all come off.", "Did you really just type that out acting as if your question wasn\u2019t just as condescending, based on the assumptions *you* made about the user because you didn\u2019t understand their joke?"]}
