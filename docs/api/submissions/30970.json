Everything just feels so fucking stupid. So my fianc\u00e9 and I have been together for 7 years. I already had kids prior to getting with him and he's always been kick ass with them. We were in our last apartment for 5 years when we found out we were expecting a baby and a couple months later he started building us our first home. Due to permits, a lot has been postponed or extended so there's still about 2 months before the home is ready.\n\nWell, our lease went up 2 months ago and we asked if we could do a month to month until our home is ready but the landlord said no, as they wanted to renovate. So we had to leave but like.. we didn't have anywhere to go outside of an extended stay hotel. So we have been here for 2 months. I had the baby right before we moved in. Well, my fianc\u00e9 made a point to say he didn't want to bring anything to the hotel that we didn't have to because it would be less to move. So all we had here for like 3 weeks was clothes and the kids tablets. But then my fianc\u00e9 started bringing more and more of his stuff here. Like his music equipment (keyboard, guitars, recording stuff), his gaming PC, his Xbox, etc. It's taking up so much space (it's a 2 bedroom). But he still doesn't want us having stuff here. So my kids are bored and getting behaviors. I'm touched out. I finally convinced him to grab the kids Xbox and the VR for storage, after asking and pleading multiple times. He wasn't happy about it. But within 2 days he was finding any reason possible why the kids couldn't play them (ie: \"I'm tired of hearing you guys fight over it\") and ended up taking the VR and Xbox with him to work one day and stuck it back in storage without telling me. So anyways, I ended up leaving. I told him he was selfish and hypocritical, considering all of his \"fun\" stuff was here while me and the kids have nothing. He said it was different because he \"doesn't fight over his shit like the kids do\". I'm at my mom's and he's been trying to make me feel guilty. \"What the fuck ever, I will go grab their shit so we can just move it again in 2 months and create more work for us\".

Very smart and NTA", "NTA\n\nSo, moving plenty of his entertainment stuff is no extra hassle to him, but god forbid he do the same for the kids so they can also occupy themselves, like he does, because the kids' fighting bothers him? This situation is difficult for everyone, not just him, but he's supposed to be an adult, and as such, should understand that kids get restless when bored for a longer period.\n\nAlso, don't let him guilt trip you with his passive agressive comments. You and your children deserve a place where you can have entertainment and peace of mind. Hopefully things will get better for all of you once you have your place ready, but your fianc\u00e9's behaviour is still very AH-ish.", "Definitely NTA.

I hope better times are ahead.", "It sounds like everyone is under a LOT of pressure right now.  Wishing you the best.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHopefully you can stay with your mother for a couple months until the house is ready. If the kids don't get to have toys BF shouldn't get to have his either.", "NTA -\n\n>He said it was different because he \"doesn't fight over his shit like the kids do\"\n\nRight, he just keeps his toys to himself and doesn't HAVE to share like the kids do.", "NTA, he\u2019s being a jerk.\n\nBut you say he\u2019s always been kick-ass with the kids, so consider whether it\u2019s just stress making him a temporarily an asshole.  Moving is up there with divorce as a stressor and you\u2019ve got moving, unexpected delays, sudden cramped space and a new baby.   It\u2019s a LOT.  Frayed tempers and stupid fights aren\u2019t great, but they\u2019d be normal.\n\nIf this is his only case of acting out in 7 years, (and if he\u2019s supported you at other times if/when you\u2019ve been a mess), then I\u2019d just accept he\u2019s not coping right now (everyone has their unique issues) and try to be the supportive one.\n\nBut if it\u2019s more of a persistent pattern, then it\u2019s a big problem.", "NTA\n\nYou guys are cooped up in too small of a space, on top of each other, with a newborn baby. You're both exhausted, you're healing and touched out (100% get that as I'm a mom), and it feels like it's endless right now. That is A LOT. \n\nHe probably thought he was more disciplining the kids, but it's leaving you stuck trying to keep your head above water while he's at work. I'm actually glad you went to your moms, hopefully she can help out with the kids and you all get a bit of breathing room. Best of luck that this blows over.", "Girl, there is absolutely no way that you are the A-hole,\n\nYour fiance is being extremely controlling about YOUR KIDS, I understand that he is your fiance but that doesn't give him the right to stomp over your and your kid's lives like that at all.\n\nIf anything, he is acting like a child himself, any child would be moody or bored if they were stuck in the same place with nothing fun to do, and it doesn't help that he believes that he himself is entitled to these things while your children should suffer.\n\nAlso, it sounds a little like is trying to establish dominance in your children or in his eyes a \"father figure\". He is being extra problematic towards both you and your kids. Try taking the high road first and talk to him on one without the kids and if he is still being extra, then and only then take the low road, tell him your boundaries and establish a set of rules towards your kids and him regarding his behaviour, if he can't comply simply do go. \n\nAlso, the fact that he is trying to guilt-trip you is unacceptable at all. he is being inconsiderate of your feelings and making the problem all about himself, if he can't realise that then he is not worth it. NTA", "dude \n\nWHAT? \n\nNTA at all. You sure you wanna marry this dude?", "NTA. You're right - he is a selfish, hypocrite. He's fine to move his own stuff but no one else is allowed more than the bare minimum. Also, hopefully it's just the stress of the new baby and the move, but it's concerning that he's changed his tune with your kids now that his baby is here. You need to keep an eye on that if you stay with him.", "NTA, but bringing a newborn home is tough even without the super high-stress situation you described. You\u2019re probably both on edge and sleep deprived. Give each other some patience. Statistically relationships tend to dip within the first year of a new child and bounce back after that.", "So the kids cant take some of their play stuff to the hotel, but the big boy can have all he wants without discussion? \n\nNTA. Your fiance is tho. The rule should apply to everyone. They are in a small hotel, and dont have anything to entertain themselfs with, so what fiance wants and expect? Fiance should be an adult and entertain the kids while you recover and take care of he baby.", "NTA. Stay right where you are and make sure he stays at the hotel.", "NTA living in a hotel is annoying enough. But not being allowed to take enough to entertain everyone is just awful. Even if he\u2019s annoyed about the kids arguing when he\u2019s there, he could still have left it so you could make the decision on how to deal with it when you\u2019re by yourself.", "NTA  He's being a problem child and you deserve better, demand it!", "This.\nYou deserve better"]}
