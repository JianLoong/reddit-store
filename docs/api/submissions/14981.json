I\u2019ve been with my girlfriend for five years now, and we\u2019ve been living together for two. The in-laws like me well enough, but they weren\u2019t crazy about us living together out of wedlock. We explained that living together was far easier on our finances, which was true, but more than anything we just wanted to take our relationship to the next level. They reluctantly agreed, they knew we were sleeping together already, they\u2019re not dumb, they just like to pretend that we weren\u2019t.\n\nAnytime we visit her parents I\u2019m forced to either sleep on the couch or in the guest room depending on availability. I\u2019m not happy about it, but hey it\u2019s their house, their rules. They\u2019re not malicious about it, it\u2019s just how they were raised.\n\nSo now we get to why I\u2019m here. The in-laws are planning a big trip late in the summer to the Bahamas for their family, which includes their other two kids and their spouses and me and my gf. They announced that they\u2019d take care of accommodations if we\u2019d take care of our airfare. Yesterday we were talking over Zoom about rooms, and my MIL mentioned off-hand that I\u2019d be in my own room. I was surprised, I said \u201cwhy spend the extra money?\u201d. To make a long story short, it\u2019s because me and my gf are not married, while the other two are. I said that\u2019s ridiculous, you\u2019re just spending extra money for no reason, especially when you know that we sleep together(as in literally sleeping) already at our apartment. We argued back and forth some more and FIL said that was what was going to happen and that if we didn\u2019t like it then we\u2019d have to pay our own way. I\u2019m a petty bastard so I said, \u201csure, as a matter of fact I want to upgrade to a suite with a jacuzzi!\u201d. My gf had to step in at this point, she said we all needed to calm down and that we\u2019d get back to them. We hung up after that.\n\nGf then had to argue with her parents over the phone for about 30 minutes while she glared at me. She mostly told them off but agreed with them on other aspects. After she was done she told me that I was in the wrong. Yes her parents\u2019 request was stupid, that they had their heads in the sand, they were wasting money, and that she was on my side in that regard. But, I was still rude and petty to her parents and that what I said didn\u2019t make the situation any better. I said that maybe I was petty, but I was sick and tired of being treated like we were doing something demonic by sleeping in the same bed together, and that I had to stand up to them. And furthermore the suite upgrade was a legitimate offer, I\u2019d pay for it myself if need be.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve had some time to reflect, maybe I was in the wrong, maybe I was being too petty and confrontational. For what it\u2019s worth, her siblings think I\u2019m a hero for standing up to them that way.\n\nSo reddit AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: For anyone curious about our ages, she is 28, and I'm 27", "created_utc": 1681671974, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ol6dy/aita_for_wanting_to_sleep_in_the_same_bed_as_my/", "score": 546, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

GF's parents for being controlling about things that are none of their business, and you for escalating instead of de-escalating.\n\n\"I understand you're not comfortable paying for a room that [GF] and I will share. Would you feel better if she and I covered the cost of our room?\"\n\nThis presents you as the reasonable one and makes it clear that you and your GF are a unit and her parents are causing a problem for *both* of you, not just you.", "NTA - However you attract more bees with honey than vinegar. Right message, wrong approach.", "INFO: how old are you both", "NTA\n\nThey need accept that this is the way things are and stop trying to force their personal beliefs onto others. I could understand if maybe this was their house, but it isn't. I'd say \"we've paying our own way if you can't accept that we're staying together\". Either that, or tell them that they either accept it or you're not going.", "NTA You're an adult and she needs to realize that. But you need to stop giving them a chance to hold this over your head. When you go visit, stay in a hotel. On the trip, pay your own way. That's the only way they're going to respect your relationship. I think your girlfriend is forgetting that she's an adult.", "NTA.  This is coming from someone who had a similar experience, except it was my parents with me.   I was living with my boyfriend at the time and we had been together many years.  However, when visiting my parents house and also on vacation, I was not allowed to sleep with my then boyfriend (now ex husband).  We were also in our 20\u2019s supporting ourselves!\n\nEvery time we\u2019d go to visit, we had to sleep separate, and honestly, it was hurtful to me.   I was used to sleeping next to my partner every night and I always felt sad and lonely.  Vacation was especially a bummer, as the whole point was to have time together and it always felt like I was being controlled (because I was)!  \n\nThey are forcing their religious beliefs on you.  And make no mistake it\u2019s a form of control and coercion.  You are adults in an adult relationship and if her parents are going to force their religion in you when around them - I would opt to not be around them.  \n\nImagine if rolls were reversed? This isn\u2019t an exact comparison- but imagine if every time you two went to visit your parents she had to cover her whole body head to toe the entire time you were there.  Would \u201ctheir house their rules\u201d still apply?  Or would she expect you to stick up to your parents and say \u201cHell no!\u201d and expect that you wouldn\u2019t be going over there?", "Nta my house my rules...it's a hotel.  Its literally not their house..\n\nThey book one room or else you take care of your airfare and your hotel and they take care of their airfare and their hotel.", "The repliers are probably unaware of these types of parents. Are they really \"nice\" and would be hurt by any confrontation? The good religious type that is passively aggressively judgmental? That's my in-laws, and it doesn't go away after marriage. Pay and go on your own vacation. They'll never get the hint, but vacation time is precious and shouldn't be used to be miserable.", "NTA. The parents lack common sense. The two of you live together and there is no reason to separate you and pretend otherwise. They said you could pay for yourselves and you called their bluff. \n\nThat said, you could have just slept in the room with your gf anyways without saying anything. I do hope you both enjoy the suite upgrade though.", "NTA. This is just ridiculous behaviour from the in laws. I'm absolutely with you on this one. Spending extra money to placate this silly notion that you aren't a real couple until you've got a pice of paper is too old fashioned. Let them spend the extra money and stay in the room with the gf.", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStop staying at their house, and **stop wasting your life on vacations with these AHs.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Simply tell them they will see you next when they stop that assholery.** You are adults, and they should not get a vote.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour gf is an AH for expecting you to cater to their unreasonable demands.", "I\u2019d consider letting them pay for two rooms and just using one. Or calling the hotel and asking for two rooms with a connecting door.\n\nAlso like the idea of saying: We can pay for our own single room if you prefer not to pay for it.\n\nAccommodating their wishes is a way of staying in the children\u2019s role. At ages 27 and 28, it\u2019s time to stand up for yourselves as adults. Is your girlfriend comfortable getting back into the little-girl role and letting her parents call the shots?", "NTA this is ridiculous of them. Maybe your girlfriend should go alone and you use your money to have a holiday where you won\u2019t feel pissed off with half the people there. I mean, is your girlfriend really planning on sleeping apart for the whole holiday? I\u2019d worry that if they\u2019re so unreasonable about this, then they\u2019ll make problems in your marriage too, if you decide to marry.", "NTA.", "NTA \n\nLet them spend the extra money and then just sleep in the same room anyways. Are they going to ground you?", "NTA Her parents need to live in the real world. You both are close to 30, certainly old enough to make your own decisions. And I agree with her siblings but they should have also stood up to the parents as well...", "NTA - stand up for yourself and don\u2018t support this bullshit - you are 28 and not 14 and this is 2023 and not 1850. pay the room for you and your girlfriend and have a nice vacation", "YTA, not for wanting to share a room with your gf but for being so argumentative about it.\n\nYou should have had a calm conversation with your gf where you offered to pay (or for you 2 to pay) to be in your own room.\n\nYou damaged the relationship with your in laws in an avoidable way.", "NTA maybe you could\u2019ve gone about it in a better way, but that\u2019s stupid.", "NTA.  They are being ridiculous, why would they pay for a room to remain empty for the vacation because sure as shit you will be sleeping with your gf while on vacation.", "My parents did this to us as well. When my sister was 48 and her significant other was 68, they still had to sleep in separate rooms while staying at their house despite living together and having a 5 year old son together before they got married.\n\nETA: NTA.", "NTA. I simply just wouldn't go", "You can be *right*, and pay for your own accommodations, or you can be *quiet* and accept free accommodations. Or you can stay home. Nobody is making you go. \n\nYTA", "No, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole. Do I think you could of approached the situation differently? Yes. I see your points 100%. You live together, been together for five years, etc.. I will say though you do know how her parents are. You knew from the beginning that they did not agree with you guys moving in together and are the classic old school folks. Do I think you\u2019re an asshole for bringing it up and wanting to share a room with your girlfriend? No. I think you should try to approach the situation differently and have an adult conversation instead of petty sarcasm. Either way they have Lee way with them paying for everything besides air fair. If you want to go and you insist on sharing a room I would pay for your trip out of your own pockets to shut them up.", "And what are they gonna do, stand guard outside your room?

That's just how it is with some parents and you're doing none of you any favors by being argumentative.\n\nWhen I was dating my wife her parents didn't care if we shared a room when we visited but mine did when we would visit them. We played by their respective rules and maintained a great relationship.

As long as they are overall respectful you should be the same.", "YTA\n\nYou and your girlfriend could pay for your own room.", "I'm going to lean towards yta.   \n\nThey are paying for this trip. If you don't like their rules.  Pay for your own place to stay.  \n\nHow old are you two?", "NTA. I\u2019d do everything I could to afford my own great room (short of selling an organ) and then act all loving over breakfast and make comments about how you hardly got any sleep (in a way that makes it obvious why). But then I\u2019m immature that way. And 44....", "NTA.  Her parents need to get over themselves.  Your gf needs to learn to stand up for themselves.  Three options:\n\n1. You agree to have your own room.  Every night, you sneak down the hallway to her room.  If you're lucky, gf's parents will catch you and that will really blow their skirts over their heads.\n2. You pay for the upgrade and have your own suite.  Tell your gf she can room with you or with her parents, but if she chooses to room with them in the Bahamas, she can room with them when you get home, too, because you're tired of this garbage.\n3. Gf tells her parents that you've decided not to join them in the Bahamas because neither of you feel like spending time with people who don't respect your relationship.\n\nThey only behave this way because the two of you have been humoring them so long.  Stop doing it.", "I'll go ESH.\n\nThey're paying for the accommodation, so they set the rules, however silly those rules may be.\n\nBut at your age, you really should just be saying \"no\" at the this point, pay for your own vacations, don't keep giving in to her parents.", "YTA. You aren\u2019t being forced. You aren\u2019t a victim here. Silly man. Get over yourself", "YTA. They are paying for the vacation, so their rules. You don't have to go.", "op=YTA\n\nif they are paying then you shut the Feck up about their arrangements(unless you have a reasonable objection--such as don't put me in bed with a stranger to save money).\n\nWhat you should have said is we are delighted to join you on this vacation, we will be arranging our own accommodations along with our ticket.\n\nThere is no reason for you to attack them.  Rather you are being a mature adult in how you deal with the situation.  \n\nSame goes when you visit them near their home, you get a hotel/motel room and visit them during the day.

Your objections are completely justified and reasonable but should have been discussed with your gf before engaging her parents like that.", "soft yta\n\nthey\u2019re paying for rooming. yes, the rule may be ridiculous to you but its not that big of a deal (if they have the money for it) and you weren\u2019t being asked to pay for the extra room. you\u2019re in your right to be upset but lashing out at her parents is what makes you ta.", "Yta.  Those are her parents rules. How does it harm you to respect them while you are with them? They're right,  if you so stuck on sleeping in the same bed, you pay for it. If not, leave it alone. They're not going to change their values and belief system for you.", "YTA.  Their beliefs dictate that you have to be provided a room of your own.  Why make a fuss over it?   Do you think that they are going to do bed checks to be sure that you're not in your girlfriend's room overnight?  You likely have guaranteed that they won't be including you in any future trips that they are going to finance so, congratulations on THAT accomplishment.", "YTA, your in laws are paying for your holidays and that would be on their terms. You put your girlfriend in a very uncomfortable situation like this by being rude and petty, because she understands why they think and act this way (they feel like don't want to participate in providing room for any possible sin in their opinions, even though she disagrees with them as much as you do). \n\nPay your own part of the holiday in full, like not only flight, but also hotel room AND food and activities if you don't appreciate their invitation this way. Or just stay home.\n\nMy parents are exactly like your in laws. They didn't like when my now husband and I went living together before marriage, but hey, their rules under their roof / when they are paying, so we abided by that (they eased up at some point though).", "Basic rule of marital peacekeeping: if it's about your girlfriend's parents, your girlfriend is right.

But I get your frustrations.\n\nMy sister fought the good fight with my mom about SOs and won and the siblings all benefited from her willpower. The difference is that it was my sister and my mom.

However, if you are not planning on getting married ever than that is a discussion that you need to have with them so they can adjust their expectations. Or their daughter does.

And and even easier win, what is keep you from just going to your gf room each night or her coming to yours? If you are getting your own rooms then just sneak in and don\u2019t tell them, lol. . . I assume they aren\u2019t doing bed checks and even if they are that\u2019s a whole other set of crazy.", "NTA. Upgrade to the suite and then let them know. That way it\u2019s irreversible. The next time you visit them, stay at a hotel. Do not play into their hand. If your gf doesn\u2019t want to stay in a hotel then let her visit alone or stay by yourself in the hotel. It\u2019s better than indulging her parents any longer. They may be old school but that doesn\u2019t entitle them to force others to live in the past with them. \n\nIf they decide to visit you and your gf by staying in your be petty and make them sleep separately. Your house, your rules. If they don\u2019t like it just tell them you\u2019re showing them the same amount of respect for you, your relationship with their daughter and the home you and she have made as they show you. \n\nYour gf needs for be more supportive of your joint stance. I get that it may be difficult to stand up to her parents but she\u2019s not a child. She needs to realize she may be their daughter but she is no longer their \u201cchild.\u201d She is an adult and needs to heavily reinforce that. Their way of thinking and doing things is obviously not her way (or your way). \n\nWhat were to happen if you had a child out of wedlock? Stranger things have happened in the world. Would they consider that child a b*st*rd? Would they treat it as less than? If the pair of you marry, would they actually change how they treat you and your relationship? (I doubt it)", "NTA, but you did take it too far on the call. I would have said \"oh no, gf will sleep in the room with me, of course.\" Then when they mentioned about paying for your own room, just agree. \"Sure no worries. Onto the next item of business.\" Just down play it all the way... like if it's not an issue for you to get your self a room for both, then don't make it one.\n\nIts a bit silly to ask someone who's already sleeping together, to just suddenly not. In their house, whatever. It's their house. But I feel like they don't own the hotel... \n\n100% they are TA. Literally just being controlling at that point. In their house, they want things their way. Who doesn't? But when it's on neutral ground, I feel they have little say.", "NTA but you could've kept it to yourself. It's annoying but can be worked around. Just go be with your GF in her room once they go to sleep. No one has to know. Problem solved.", "Why aren't you married yet? \ud83e\udd14", "NTA do you even want to go with these people on a trip? I wouldn't want to go at all now, just go on your own holiday either there or elsewhere without them", "NTA  I do give them credit for at least being consistent and offering to pay for the room.  It's still just stupid since you're already living together. All the efforts to maintain some illusion are sketchy. It has more to do with them being concerned about being judged by others than anything else. Which probably means they are lying actively or by omission to others already regarding your living conditions. \nYou probably could have been more diplomatic about it. I would have agreed and then just bunked together and left the room empty. It would have been funny", "NTA\n\nIf she isn't going to have your back, why bother wiving her? Y'all have been together 5 years, it's time to be a damn couple instead of having her parents all up in your bedroom.   This is so weird in today's age and time.", "Why does he have to be reasonable when the parents arent? Why cant they rethink their backwarded approach? We arent living in the 50s anymore.", "Yeah I wouldnt go either!  I'm together for 15 years with my so, not married. I don't get that in the US relationships don't count if your not married. People in my country don't get married that often anymore. And no parent I know would insist on sleeping in seperate rooms. Sometimes I feel like the time stood still for many decades, when I read this kinds of posts", "Why did I have to scroll so far down to find this, lol? This was immediately where my head went, just say \u201cok\u201d then go there anyway, now you guys have 2 rooms to yourselves, lol", "I'd start putting them in separate bedrooms if they ever came to visit, since I'm uncomfortable with old people fucking in my home.", "That is exactly what it is doing... Using money to force compliance.  They aren't even paying airfare.  You can dress up your words and talk in circles all day long, it doesn't make it anything less than forcing compliance.", "Exactly.  Or they can go and stay at a separate resort.  \ud83e\udd23 Or go the week before and/or after the parents.  There are so many fun ways to stand up to dusty dinosaurs.", "Same. For being petty and rude I\u2019m surprised they\u2019d still have OP at all. They sound\u2026unpleasant.   YTA.", "They could have paid for the plane tickets in that case. They for sure chose to pay for the hotel to be able to control their adult daughters relationship.", "YTA- I am 50 and if I take a partner anywhere with family I still sleep separately because of their beliefs.  The flip side is my mom doesn't day a word about visiting me and my partner in my home.  If you are travelling with them,  you should honour their wishes.", "YTA\n\nIt's annoying, but how it is. You can do like the rest of us all did and go to her bedroom or have her come to yours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey are paying for a vacation... if you don't like the terms then don't go.", "YTA - yes they are old school, yes they are being ridiculous about it but YOU knew all that about them and still decided to go on holiday with them on their dime. What did you think was going to happen. \n\nNo point arguing about it just get on with life. \n\nIf you wanna get really petty and also end the issue forever, elope before the holiday and then produce your marriage license and share a room. \n\nDepending on your culture they may genuinely think less of their daughter for sleeping with you and just be putting up with it through denial. While we are at it 5 years is a long while, long enough to know if your in it or not for the long haul imo. Maybe they are pushing for you to propose or get off their daughter so she\u2019s not wasting her time.", "Nope, NTA. FFS you two are pushing 30 and already living together. Her parents are being ridiculous, it\u2019s about time she discusses this with them.", "I would of said sure, no worries. \nEach night I'd be in her room, or she in mine.\nSimple.", "YTA.\n\nI get that you're frustrated by their ridiculous views, but what exactly did you think was going to happen with them sorting out accomodation? If they're not comfortable with the idea of you both sharing a room when you stay with them, why on earth would you expect them to pay for a hotel room for both of you?\n\nThey're wasting their own money, but that's their call, they can clearly afford it if they can spring for hotel accomodation for themselves, 3 kids and spouses/partners in the Bahamas.\n\nYou've handled the situation horribly. A little bit of grace wouldn't have gone amiss.", "If you want to sleep in the same bed, I would just pay for myself.", "Thats really controlling of them. This whole \"we pay so you play with our rules.\" Its shitty that your Gf is in this though Spot right now so if you want apologize but get your own room with your GF don't let them have this control over you two.", "NTA. But is there any reason you can't have your own room and she come stay in there with you?", "YTA.  This is your gf's family and her issue.  You should have had this conversation with your gf a long time ago and not directly with your gf's parents.  NEVER argue with your SO family unless they are being mean/cruel/upsetting to your SO.  It never works out well and causes your SO to take sides when it isn't necessary.  Apologize to the parents for being petty and confrontational, but also have a discussion with your gf that this nonsense has to stop and that you no longer want to visit her parents and sleep separately.  If you have to, book a hotel nearby.", "Just because you have separate rooms doesn't mean you need to use both.", "NTA. Thanks for the offer but we will pay for our own room.", "Yes, YATA.", "ESH\n\nParents for being controlling, and in some ways hyproctitical.\n\nYou know  taking their money  will have strings attached. So really you should have told them if there is an issue, you wouldn't go or pay for the accommodation yourself.", "Let em buy 2 rooms and bang their daughter silly in both of them", "YTA. If I were her parents, I would cancel your trip.", "Holy crap that is so bizarre.", "It might be weird, but that's the idiom. I'm guessing it stems from people trying to catch flies that were bothering them. While most people aren't trying to catch bees \n\nhttps://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/You+can+catch+more+flies+with+honey+than+with+vinegar", "Oh yeah nothing controlling about religion whatsoever.", "A misremembered idiom is not a malapropism (sorry just being pedantic)", "\"We'll give you a free trip to the Bahamas if you kow tow to our asinine beliefs\" is, indisputable financial manipulation.\n\nPretending it's not is delusional."]}
