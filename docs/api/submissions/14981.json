I\u2019ve been with my girlfriend for five years now, and we\u2019ve been living together for two. The in-laws like me well enough, but they weren\u2019t crazy about us living together out of wedlock. We explained that living together was far easier on our finances, which was true, but more than anything we just wanted to take our relationship to the next level. They reluctantly agreed, they knew we were sleeping together already, they\u2019re not dumb, they just like to pretend that we weren\u2019t.\n\nAnytime we visit her parents I\u2019m forced to either sleep on the couch or in the guest room depending on availability. I\u2019m not happy about it, but hey it\u2019s their house, their rules. They\u2019re not malicious about it, it\u2019s just how they were raised.\n\nSo now we get to why I\u2019m here. The in-laws are planning a big trip late in the summer to the Bahamas for their family, which includes their other two kids and their spouses and me and my gf. They announced that they\u2019d take care of accommodations if we\u2019d take care of our airfare. Yesterday we were talking over Zoom about rooms, and my MIL mentioned off-hand that I\u2019d be in my own room. I was surprised, I said \u201cwhy spend the extra money?\u201d. To make a long story short, it\u2019s because me and my gf are not married, while the other two are. I said that\u2019s ridiculous, you\u2019re just spending extra money for no reason, especially when you know that we sleep together(as in literally sleeping) already at our apartment. We argued back and forth some more and FIL said that was what was going to happen and that if we didn\u2019t like it then we\u2019d have to pay our own way. I\u2019m a petty bastard so I said, \u201csure, as a matter of fact I want to upgrade to a suite with a jacuzzi!\u201d. My gf had to step in at this point, she said we all needed to calm down and that we\u2019d get back to them. We hung up after that.\n\nGf then had to argue with her parents over the phone for about 30 minutes while she glared at me. She mostly told them off but agreed with them on other aspects. After she was done she told me that I was in the wrong. Yes her parents\u2019 request was stupid, that they had their heads in the sand, they were wasting money, and that she was on my side in that regard. But, I was still rude and petty to her parents and that what I said didn\u2019t make the situation any better. I said that maybe I was petty, but I was sick and tired of being treated like we were doing something demonic by sleeping in the same bed together, and that I had to stand up to them. And furthermore the suite upgrade was a legitimate offer, I\u2019d pay for it myself if need be.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve had some time to reflect, maybe I was in the wrong, maybe I was being too petty and confrontational. For what it\u2019s worth, her siblings think I\u2019m a hero for standing up to them that way.\n\nSo reddit AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: For anyone curious about our ages, she is 28, and I'm 27", "created_utc": 1681671974, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ol6dy/aita_for_wanting_to_sleep_in_the_same_bed_as_my/", "score": 139, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

GF's parents for being controlling about things that are none of their business, and you for escalating instead of de-escalating.\n\n\"I understand you're not comfortable paying for a room that [GF] and I will share. Would you feel better if she and I covered the cost of our room?\"\n\nThis presents you as the reasonable one and makes it clear that you and your GF are a unit and her parents are causing a problem for *both* of you, not just you.", "NTA - However you attract more bees with honey than vinegar. Right message, wrong approach.", "INFO: how old are you both", "NTA\n\nThey need accept that this is the way things are and stop trying to force their personal beliefs onto others. I could understand if maybe this was their house, but it isn't. I'd say \"we've paying our own way if you can't accept that we're staying together\". Either that, or tell them that they either accept it or you're not going.", "NTA You're an adult and she needs to realize that. But you need to stop giving them a chance to hold this over your head. When you go visit, stay in a hotel. On the trip, pay your own way. That's the only way they're going to respect your relationship. I think your girlfriend is forgetting that she's an adult.", "NTA.  This is coming from someone who had a similar experience, except it was my parents with me.   I was living with my boyfriend at the time and we had been together many years.  However, when visiting my parents house and also on vacation, I was not allowed to sleep with my then boyfriend (now ex husband).  We were also in our 20\u2019s supporting ourselves!\n\nEvery time we\u2019d go to visit, we had to sleep separate, and honestly, it was hurtful to me.   I was used to sleeping next to my partner every night and I always felt sad and lonely.  Vacation was especially a bummer, as the whole point was to have time together and it always felt like I was being controlled (because I was)!  \n\nThey are forcing their religious beliefs on you.  And make no mistake it\u2019s a form of control and coercion.  You are adults in an adult relationship and if her parents are going to force their religion in you when around them - I would opt to not be around them.  \n\nImagine if rolls were reversed? This isn\u2019t an exact comparison- but imagine if every time you two went to visit your parents she had to cover her whole body head to toe the entire time you were there.  Would \u201ctheir house their rules\u201d still apply?  Or would she expect you to stick up to your parents and say \u201cHell no!\u201d and expect that you wouldn\u2019t be going over there?", "Nta my house my rules...it's a hotel.  Its literally not their house..\n\nThey book one room or else you take care of your airfare and your hotel and they take care of their airfare and their hotel.", "The repliers are probably unaware of these types of parents. Are they really \"nice\" and would be hurt by any confrontation? The good religious type that is passively aggressively judgmental? That's my in-laws, and it doesn't go away after marriage. Pay and go on your own vacation. They'll never get the hint, but vacation time is precious and shouldn't be used to be miserable.", "NTA. The parents lack common sense. The two of you live together and there is no reason to separate you and pretend otherwise. They said you could pay for yourselves and you called their bluff. \n\nThat said, you could have just slept in the room with your gf anyways without saying anything. I do hope you both enjoy the suite upgrade though.", "NTA. This is just ridiculous behaviour from the in laws. I'm absolutely with you on this one. Spending extra money to placate this silly notion that you aren't a real couple until you've got a pice of paper is too old fashioned. Let them spend the extra money and stay in the room with the gf.", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStop staying at their house, and **stop wasting your life on vacations with these AHs.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Simply tell them they will see you next when they stop that assholery.** You are adults, and they should not get a vote.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour gf is an AH for expecting you to cater to their unreasonable demands.", "I\u2019d consider letting them pay for two rooms and just using one. Or calling the hotel and asking for two rooms with a connecting door.\n\nAlso like the idea of saying: We can pay for our own single room if you prefer not to pay for it.\n\nAccommodating their wishes is a way of staying in the children\u2019s role. At ages 27 and 28, it\u2019s time to stand up for yourselves as adults. Is your girlfriend comfortable getting back into the little-girl role and letting her parents call the shots?", "NTA this is ridiculous of them. Maybe your girlfriend should go alone and you use your money to have a holiday where you won\u2019t feel pissed off with half the people there. I mean, is your girlfriend really planning on sleeping apart for the whole holiday? I\u2019d worry that if they\u2019re so unreasonable about this, then they\u2019ll make problems in your marriage too, if you decide to marry.", "NTA.", "NTA \n\nLet them spend the extra money and then just sleep in the same room anyways. Are they going to ground you?", "NTA Her parents need to live in the real world. You both are close to 30, certainly old enough to make your own decisions. And I agree with her siblings but they should have also stood up to the parents as well...", "NTA - stand up for yourself and don\u2018t support this bullshit - you are 28 and not 14 and this is 2023 and not 1850. pay the room for you and your girlfriend and have a nice vacation", "YTA, not for wanting to share a room with your gf but for being so argumentative about it.\n\nYou should have had a calm conversation with your gf where you offered to pay (or for you 2 to pay) to be in your own room.\n\nYou damaged the relationship with your in laws in an avoidable way.", "NTA maybe you could\u2019ve gone about it in a better way, but that\u2019s stupid.", "NTA.  They are being ridiculous, why would they pay for a room to remain empty for the vacation because sure as shit you will be sleeping with your gf while on vacation.", "My parents did this to us as well. When my sister was 48 and her significant other was 68, they still had to sleep in separate rooms while staying at their house despite living together and having a 5 year old son together before they got married.\n\nETA: NTA.", "NTA. I simply just wouldn't go", "You can be *right*, and pay for your own accommodations, or you can be *quiet* and accept free accommodations. Or you can stay home. Nobody is making you go. \n\nYTA", "No, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole. Do I think you could of approached the situation differently? Yes. I see your points 100%. You live together, been together for five years, etc.. I will say though you do know how her parents are. You knew from the beginning that they did not agree with you guys moving in together and are the classic old school folks. Do I think you\u2019re an asshole for bringing it up and wanting to share a room with your girlfriend? No. I think you should try to approach the situation differently and have an adult conversation instead of petty sarcasm. Either way they have Lee way with them paying for everything besides air fair. If you want to go and you insist on sharing a room I would pay for your trip out of your own pockets to shut them up.", "And what are they gonna do, stand guard outside your room?

That's just how it is with some parents and you're doing none of you any favors by being argumentative.\n\nWhen I was dating my wife her parents didn't care if we shared a room when we visited but mine did when we would visit them. We played by their respective rules and maintained a great relationship.

As long as they are overall respectful you should be the same.", "YTA\n\nYou and your girlfriend could pay for your own room.", "I'm going to lean towards yta.   \n\nThey are paying for this trip. If you don't like their rules.  Pay for your own place to stay.  \n\nHow old are you two?", "NTA. I\u2019d do everything I could to afford my own great room (short of selling an organ) and then act all loving over breakfast and make comments about how you hardly got any sleep (in a way that makes it obvious why). But then I\u2019m immature that way. And 44....", "NTA.  Her parents need to get over themselves.  Your gf needs to learn to stand up for themselves.  Three options:\n\n1. You agree to have your own room.  Every night, you sneak down the hallway to her room.  If you're lucky, gf's parents will catch you and that will really blow their skirts over their heads.\n2. You pay for the upgrade and have your own suite.  Tell your gf she can room with you or with her parents, but if she chooses to room with them in the Bahamas, she can room with them when you get home, too, because you're tired of this garbage.\n3. Gf tells her parents that you've decided not to join them in the Bahamas because neither of you feel like spending time with people who don't respect your relationship.\n\nThey only behave this way because the two of you have been humoring them so long.  Stop doing it.", "I'll go ESH.\n\nThey're paying for the accommodation, so they set the rules, however silly those rules may be.\n\nBut at your age, you really should just be saying \"no\" at the this point, pay for your own vacations, don't keep giving in to her parents.", "YTA. You aren\u2019t being forced. You aren\u2019t a victim here. Silly man. Get over yourself", "YTA. They are paying for the vacation, so their rules. You don't have to go.", "op=YTA\n\nif they are paying then you shut the Feck up about their arrangements(unless you have a reasonable objection--such as don't put me in bed with a stranger to save money).\n\nWhat you should have said is we are delighted to join you on this vacation, we will be arranging our own accommodations along with our ticket.\n\nThere is no reason for you to attack them.  Rather you are being a mature adult in how you deal with the situation.  \n\nSame goes when you visit them near their home, you get a hotel/motel room and visit them during the day.

Your objections are completely justified and reasonable but should have been discussed with your gf before engaging her parents like that.", "soft yta\n\nthey\u2019re paying for rooming. yes, the rule may be ridiculous to you but its not that big of a deal (if they have the money for it) and you weren\u2019t being asked to pay for the extra room. you\u2019re in your right to be upset but lashing out at her parents is what makes you ta.", "Yta.  Those are her parents rules. How does it harm you to respect them while you are with them? They're right,  if you so stuck on sleeping in the same bed, you pay for it. If not, leave it alone. They're not going to change their values and belief system for you.", "YTA.  Their beliefs dictate that you have to be provided a room of your own.  Why make a fuss over it?   Do you think that they are going to do bed checks to be sure that you're not in your girlfriend's room overnight?  You likely have guaranteed that they won't be including you in any future trips that they are going to finance so, congratulations on THAT accomplishment.", "YTA, your in laws are paying for your holidays and that would be on their terms. You put your girlfriend in a very uncomfortable situation like this by being rude and petty, because she understands why they think and act this way (they feel like don't want to participate in providing room for any possible sin in their opinions, even though she disagrees with them as much as you do). \n\nPay your own part of the holiday in full, like not only flight, but also hotel room AND food and activities if you don't appreciate their invitation this way. Or just stay home.\n\nMy parents are exactly like your in laws. They didn't like when my now husband and I went living together before marriage, but hey, their rules under their roof / when they are paying, so we abided by that (they eased up at some point though).", "Basic rule of marital peacekeeping: if it's about your girlfriend's parents, your girlfriend is right.

But I get your frustrations.\n\nMy sister fought the good fight with my mom about SOs and won and the siblings all benefited from her willpower. The difference is that it was my sister and my mom.

However, if you are not planning on getting married ever than that is a discussion that you need to have with them so they can adjust their expectations. Or their daughter does.

Bees aren't drawn to honey, they make it \ud83d\ude02", "They probably prefer if OP doesn\u2019t go. He should let his GF deal with her own parents. If they plan for a future together he shouldn\u2019t be the one stirring the pot and being the \u201cbad guy\u201d.", "This. The trip already sounds like a nightmare, and I\u2019d opt right out of it altogether. Until they treat you like adults, they can get used to not seeing you.", "I see your bias is showing.  NTA.", "Why is everyone missing the part where he said he\u2019d do just that?", "He literally said they would pay their own way, including an upgrade...", "Thing is, they aren\u2019t his in laws yet. They are his girlfriend\u2019s parents until the two are married. I\u2019m curious as to why they haven\u2019t gotten married after being together for 5 years and living together for 2 years. One would think at that point you know if you want to spend your life with someone. Obviously it would remove some of the difficulties they\u2019re having with the girlfriend\u2019s parents.", "No one asked for advice on a possible marriage.", "Paying for a trip, helping with rent, paying bills, giving groceries, etc... All of these financial things are often (but not always) ways parents maintain control of situations. True independence can only be achieved through financial independence.\n\nBut the fact the parents are willing to pay for his separate room is good of them. Still controlling though. I'm sure they can't bring themselves to contribute to a situation they are uncomfortable with. Up to the OP to accept, pay for self, or not go.", "The phrase \"unlimited sex\" really highlights the mindset here...", "If we\u2019re gonna throw around the word sin, let\u2019s get that book out and actually weigh their sins instead of picking and choosing based on puritanical nonsense.", "Yep, the parents are controlling.  Religion is control.\n\nEdit: ahh I see from your other comment that you can't say their controlling because that would force you to face that your parents are controlling.", "If you're staying in the same room with your gf and your parents are in the next room over you're probably not having much sex at all, and neither are they, fwiw.", "Found the parents.", "Bees are actually drawn to honey, spill some near a hive and watch them scavenge it!", "I see you've never harvested honey.", "Flies are attracted to shit. It's bees. And bees will definitely go after honey and gather it back to the hive. Ever seen an apiary?", "Lol, are you kidding?  This has to be sarcasm.  Because flies are actually attracted to vinegar as well as bees to honey. \ud83e\udd23 \ud83e\udd23", "Then why go with them? Pay for everything to go on vacation and then hang out w/ them? Doesn't sound worth a vacation to me. My in-laws would have been the same way, minus being willing to pay for a vacation. We barely talk to them b/c even if you get to be in the same bedroom after marriage, the oppressive religious judgments and attitudes don't go away.", "I would have added, \"and not be a jerk to her owners,\" but I assumed that would have been understood.", "He also said that they are paying for the accommodation.   \n\nHim and the daughter can refuse that and pay their own hotel.   Then it's their rules.  \n\nAge also matters here.", "I have been with my boyfriend for decades and we have 4 children, not married though. We just dont find it important, not everyone does. My parents arent married either, nor are most of my friends.", "My parents are like OP's and they eased up after a few months  when my now husband and I lived together out of wedlock. They realised it was a bit silly to keep us separated if every night at home in our studio we would be in the same bed anyway. \n\nHowever, it is not controlling but it is their conscious coming from their religion. They don't want to actively 'provide situations in which people would sin' by their money spent or under their roof.\n\nThis has nothing to do with trying to control their daughter, rather a 'I am not partaking in someone else's sin' kind of thing. Just like people shouldn't actively make others break the laws of the country they live in. Except it is more of a ideologist thing with this.", "All religions are a way of controlling large groups of people and especially women. This is an extension of that control. So in fact the parents are indeed being controlling, even if by proxy. It won't help this couple in their argument with these parents. But it's true nonetheless. \n\nI would get a room in a nearby hotel.", "Right?  There's nothing that turns me on more than my inlaws in the next room possibly hearing me!\n\nIt's one reqson we always get a hotel room when we visit my inlaws.  Would do it when we visit my dad too, except it's an hours drive to the nearest hotel.", "No. I'm allergic to bees. But I take your point.", "What an excellent freudian slip", "Her \u201cowners\u201d?", "They're almost 30.", "Using religion an an excuse to be controlling does not make it any less controlling.", "Almost agreed til you said it's not controlling because \"religion\" lol.", "My parents were the same way. They were aware my boyfriend and I lived together, but did not allow it in their home. Nor did any of my other family. My now husband and I , never cared about the rule. It didn't bother us. It didn't make anything difficult for us. It never bothered us to respect their household, and they never disrespected our home. I think it never affected us, because we were both raised that people have the right to establish whatever rule they want, in their home/space.", "Watch 'how to gather your bee honey' and see all the at home apiarists do it one way or another. They always count on the bees to clean up any spills they make because they're attracted to the honey as it's their food source.", "Parents, sorry. My phone hates Reddit.", "That makes sense. Thanks for the tip.", "LOL phew, I was wondering how this convo had taken such a weird turn\u2026"]}
