Not for risk of violence, but because of general hazards on the kitchen. \n\nShe is lightly one because she is forcing extra, completely unnecessary, movement in the kitchen, same risks as why you are one. Her right to do things like that end when they inconvenience someone that doesn't share the same belief, pretty much a much *much* lighter version of forcing a religion on someone.", "YTA. I have weird superstitions that i sometimes put on others too. but no one has ever snapped at me for asking them to walk on the same side of the pole as me. Especially not after i explain the superstition ties to my family.", "YTA you\u2019re intentionally doing something that makes your girlfriend uncomfortable. Not being behind someone with a knife in hand is a pretty reasonable thing to ask. Your gf is superstitious, she\u2019s not doing anything to harm anyone, she is telling you that she does not like you being behind her with a knife and to be aware that she does not like this. Your response is \u201cI am aware but I don\u2019t care\u201d and then you decide to yell to try and force your point that you don\u2019t care enough to not do something that makes her uncomfortable. Do you even like your girlfriend?\n\nEasy solution if you really want to avoid putting effort into making your partner comfortable while cooking together = don\u2019t cook together therefore chances of being around each other with knives drastically reduce. I just don\u2019t understand how \u201cplease don\u2019t walk behind me with a knife\u201d is that big of an ask for someone you love.\n\nETA: rereading through this and I may be reading it slightly wrong that it wasn\u2019t just for safety(which avoiding being behind someone with a knife is kinda standard safety) she did it more of a playful sharing of her childhood. She even told you it was culturally relevant as she follows these superstitions as it reminds her of her mum and home. It brings your gf comfort and happiness. I\u2019d honestly break up with you for yelling at me for something like that. You would have shown her by that outburst that you would have no respect for her or her culture, if you deemed it silly enough in your eyes you\u2019d scream and insult her beliefs.", "YTA  \nI hope eithe ryou get your crap together and stop being the way you are OR she wakes up and realizes how little you care about her.", "YTA you actually SCREAMED at her for that??? i\u2019ve never in my life screamed at ANYONE i care about, no matter how angry i got (borderline personality disorder and everything!), because i know how horrible it feels to be screamed at by someone you love. ESPECIALLY over something as small as a superstition that absolutely does not warrant that kind of anger. your love for that person should always outweigh your anger. \n\nsnapping at someone with a harsh/annoyed tone is one thing, but you actually screamed at her. is this a usual response to you \u201csnapping\u201d? if i were you i\u2019d be concerned that something that small gave me such a huge overreaction", "YTA.
