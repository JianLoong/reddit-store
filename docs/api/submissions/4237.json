Considering the wife feels the need to lie about where she is to escape him for a week this relationship is doomed already. \n\nThe wife goes without judgement because she is in abuse situation from the sounds of things and clearly has many issues. She feels the need to run and hide from her much older husband. She is having a borderline emotional affair with her husband's daughter, yet it sounds like this is the only \"friend\" she's been able to have. I doubt she knows anyone else that she can go to as her mother is a flight away. When trying to escape such a toxic relationship it's important to have an escape plan where it sounds like OP was the best option.\n\nOP you're an AH too. You lied to your father rather than say you won't talk about his relationship. You then let him into your home knowing that it will cause a fight between them and could put her in danger. You are preying on an emotionally vulnerable woman with the intention of cornering her into a relationship with you, while she is married to your father. She doesn't need another person trying to get into her pants. Calm down and ignore any romantic feelings and thoughts of marrying her, focus on being the friend she needs right now. You know she's in a likely abusive relationship and needs therapy to heal and grow healthy boundaries before another relationship is ever a possibility. Please if you care about her put her needs before your wants. If something happens after she gets away and heals then good for you, but let those things happen first.", "ESH.

One, your father and stepmother are having issues that they need to figure out. Whatever's going on, it seems like she's not happy in their relationship, and it might mean that they shouldn't be together. Okay, fine, but that's not your issue.\n\nTwo: you inserted yourself into their conflict, not by letting her stay with you, but by actively lying about where she was. Again, whatever is going on between them is their business. You do not owe your father any answers about his wife's whereabouts, and you are certainly at liberty to keep her confidences, but *actively* lying to him is over the line. You could have ignored his calls; or when he said he was worried about her you could have deflected and said something like \"Hey, you should call her directly.
