I was young and dumb, but one good thing that came out of it was my wife Alanna(44F). Fortunately, I come from a well off family, and when Alanna was kicked out my parents took her in. Two years later we had our son. We wanted both kids to grow up together. My parents helped out a lot and years later I became a successful lawyer and Alanna became an architect.\n\nMy family doesn't do Christmas and for birthdays we always got what our children wanted. So, unequal gifts or favoritism never really came up. As for education, we agreed to pay for everything. Because of our income they were not eligible for most scholarships, and frankly even if they were I would've still paid because some one else could really use it.\n\nWhen my daughter, Sam(now 28), turned 18, she took a break. I got her a job in my firm's mailroom where she worked for two years. As she still lived with us, she saved most of it. Even after she got into a good law school she worked part time. I didn't spend much on her even though we just wanted her to enjoy college without worrying about anything else. She paid for most of it herself.\n\nMy son, Bill(now 26), got into a prestigious Medical school. We paid for everything, including pre-med. Sam was never jealous, and we never had problems with Bill, but problems began with their partners.\n\nSam's partner is a good man. He's a total geek, and a computer engineer. He's kind, polite, and get along with us. He didn't come from money and very responsible. A good fit for Sam.\n\nMy son's partner, Jill, on the other hand is handful. I wouldn't call her a gold digger, but I can say she's very materialistic. When Bill started his residency a year and half ago, I stopped paying for his expenses, but as soon they moved in together, he started asking for money sometimes. A few months ago I gave him 50k, to put a deposit on house.\n\nSam got engaged a month ago, and we decide to gift them a house I got for a bargain. Why? Because I never really spent much on Sam. On new years eve, Sam couldn't stop thanking us for the gift. Bill was all smiles. Jill on the other hand was confused. Bill knew beforehand, but Jill didn't.\n\nI noticed them whispering to each other and Bill grew upset. After a while Jill started making snide remarks. Things escalated and Bill accused us of favoritism. He though it was unfair that Sam got a whole house while he only got 50k. Things got loud, and I finally had enough.\n\nI finally said it was unfair, and I'll remedy it right now. I wrote a cheque for 50k and gave it to my daughter. Bill was confused, and Jill started shouting.\n\nMy wife intervened and said now they were even, we're done and spent enough on him. She kicked him out, and asked to not come back home or expect any help from us until he thought long and hard about everything and apologized to us.\n\nBill was silent but Jill called us ahs as they left.

Only 50K? You paid for his entire education and medical school - while Sam worked and saved. Seems Jill is a gold digger who is winding him up. Hopefully he'll have a good think and come to his senses.", "NTA  \n\n\nYour money, you can decide how to spend it.  \nPretty sure you should have some documentation on how much was spent on each of them till now.  \nJust send it over to Bill and let him understand that the was the one who got the better deal till now.  \n\n\nOh, and ensure that Jill understands that it is not cool to instigate problem on how you can spend your money (or declare her as a persona non grata in your house) before letting Bill out of the dog house, else your family is going to have a lot of drama in the future.  \n\n\nJust saying that as the instigator was Jill and she unless she understands that it is not okay to poke her nose in the in-laws business and how they spend things, it might cause many future conflicts.", "NTA. Nice move on the 50k.", "NTA, Bill obviously doesn't understand just how much having med school *fully paid for* really set him up for life. A lot of doctors who self fund are still in debt up to your age or beyond in some cases because of predatory loan practices.\n\nIf he deigns to talk to you again, sit down with him and explain just how much medical school cost and why you feel hurt that he is now trying to ask for more when you technically gave a lesser gift to his sister.", "NTA for the money part of it, at least. I personally would've handled it differently. Maybe if you could've quietly reminded Bill about how you funded medical school while Sam worked (before things got heated) it could've defused the situation before things escalated. Sounds like he was happy for her at first till Jill whispered to him, so maybe he could've come around without making a huge deal of it. But if he still wasn't willing to see the logic, NTA at all for how things ended up.", "NTA.\n\nThe writing the second check to Sam was a bit over the top. That didn't help an escalating situation.\n\nHowever, your justification - that you spent a lot on your son early on and now you're compensating for Sam - that addresses the so-called unfairness. \n\nBut the other thing is... your kids are adults. You get to decide how to spend money on your adult children, and if they feel it's unfair, they can have a non-crappy convo with you about it. The way Jill and Bill chose to handle it - snide remarks, accusations, calling you names... they're adults and they're not hurting.  This is like siblings complaining that mom only left the sapphires to Annie when everyone knows the sapphires mean more to Leslie. Get over yourselves, kids.", "NTA  your son's entitled wife seems to be turning him into one though & wifey is definitely a major AH.  I'm sure if you actually did the books on the exact dollar figure that went to each, he would come out ahead even after the check.  Too bad your son has lost perspective.\n\nEdit to add even if your daughter had been given more, it's none of DIL business what you do with your money.", "NTA.\n\nYou've been extraordinarily generous toward both your children. One of them has been appreciative. The other has been selfish and acted entitled. You specifically mentioned Jill making snide remarks and Bill accusing you of favoritism.\n\nEven if their negative reaction was warranted, them complaining that you haven't been generous enough toward them is ludicrous. And it clearly wasn't warranted. Bill and Jill are the AHs here.", "NTA - my parents have never gifted me a house or 50k that's highly generous. Your son's wife is very ungrateful to kick off that 50k wasn't enough especially if you're giving it for a house payment it's basically the same as giving them a house and also YOU'RE GIVING THEM 50K, that's not pocket change that's a huge sum. It sounds like your poor son is caught in the middle and being pushed by his wife.", "Jill will continue to manipulate him. If you can, lay everything out black and white and show him there was never any favoritism", "Nta \nIt\u2019s your money not his, and if I may give my opinion: I would stop giving/ gifting away such valuable things because in the end it will only lead to jealousy.\n\nBut your son really should change his attitude and think about his manners and actions, you are his father not his wallet", "NTA - A dramatic gesture to be sure. But I am curious whether Sam cashed that check or thought it best just to let you have your dramatic moment and refuse the money after Bill had left.", "NTA - Your money. You gift it as you please.  Those gifted can say thank you, or they can whine about someone else getting more.", "NTA - Jill is.", "There's a lot to unpack here.\n\nOn the one hand I wanna say E S H, because it seems money has made *everyone* terrible. I mean, except maybe Sam. Keep in mind the sums you're talking about are well beyond the grasp of most people to comprehend as \"gifts\", and this alone may cause people to think Y T A.\n\nHowever, as it pertains particularly to you handling Bill and Jill, NTA. You've footed a lot of Bill's expenses \u2014 education, med schools, money, etc. \u2014 whereas Jill was a baller and paid her own way. As you noted you even outright gave him $50K.\n\nNow, the value of Bill's education may approximate the value of Sam's house, so that might make them even-steven. But \"to make it fair\", the cheque of $50K to Sam \u2014 to equal Bill's prior $50K \u2014 is a pretty visible object lesson.\n\nAt the end of the day, you are the arbiter of your family's finances, and Jill can go eat a bag of dicks. While Bill may be \"entitled\" to a share of your estate \u2014 just as Sam is \u2014 neither of their spouses are owed anything. Sam's husband gets this, but Jill certainly doesn't.", "NTA. She\u2019s the devil in his ear.", "NTA, by the way, I'm up for adoption.", "NTA, my parents helped me more with my education and paid for my brother to have a car in HS and college and a little beyond and helped with his house down payment.  We are probably equal or possibly I'm still a little ahead.  We had different needs, I didn't start driving till my 30s and bought a house later and my husband and I didn't need the help, my brother didn't get an advanced degree.  Jill is obviously stirring the pot because she sounds a bit greedy, seems like Bill was fine and understood till she got involved.  There's probably going to be drama for a while though, sounds like Bill needs to get worked up to keep the peace at home.", "ESH (except Sam and her partner I guess). You established from the beginning the principle that you would give both children what they wanted. Turning it around into a \"you both get exactly the same amount of money your entire lives\" thing without warning is a dick move. But so is feeling entitled to money just because your parents (or parents in law) are wealthy.\n\nTo be honest this also all sounds like rich people problems to me, so I guess you should do whatever you want, who cares.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
