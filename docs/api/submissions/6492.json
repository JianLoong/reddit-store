I was young and dumb, but one good thing that came out of it was my wife Alanna(44F). Fortunately, I come from a well off family, and when Alanna was kicked out my parents took her in. Two years later we had our son. We wanted both kids to grow up together. My parents helped out a lot and years later I became a successful lawyer and Alanna became an architect.\n\nMy family doesn't do Christmas and for birthdays we always got what our children wanted. So, unequal gifts or favoritism never really came up. As for education, we agreed to pay for everything. Because of our income they were not eligible for most scholarships, and frankly even if they were I would've still paid because some one else could really use it.\n\nWhen my daughter, Sam(now 28), turned 18, she took a break. I got her a job in my firm's mailroom where she worked for two years. As she still lived with us, she saved most of it. Even after she got into a good law school she worked part time. I didn't spend much on her even though we just wanted her to enjoy college without worrying about anything else. She paid for most of it herself.\n\nMy son, Bill(now 26), got into a prestigious Medical school. We paid for everything, including pre-med. Sam was never jealous, and we never had problems with Bill, but problems began with their partners.\n\nSam's partner is a good man. He's a total geek, and a computer engineer. He's kind, polite, and get along with us. He didn't come from money and very responsible. A good fit for Sam.\n\nMy son's partner, Jill, on the other hand is handful. I wouldn't call her a gold digger, but I can say she's very materialistic. When Bill started his residency a year and half ago, I stopped paying for his expenses, but as soon they moved in together, he started asking for money sometimes. A few months ago I gave him 50k, to put a deposit on house.\n\nSam got engaged a month ago, and we decide to gift them a house I got for a bargain. Why? Because I never really spent much on Sam. On new years eve, Sam couldn't stop thanking us for the gift. Bill was all smiles. Jill on the other hand was confused. Bill knew beforehand, but Jill didn't.\n\nI noticed them whispering to each other and Bill grew upset. After a while Jill started making snide remarks. Things escalated and Bill accused us of favoritism. He though it was unfair that Sam got a whole house while he only got 50k. Things got loud, and I finally had enough.\n\nI finally said it was unfair, and I'll remedy it right now. I wrote a cheque for 50k and gave it to my daughter. Bill was confused, and Jill started shouting.\n\nMy wife intervened and said now they were even, we're done and spent enough on him. She kicked him out, and asked to not come back home or expect any help from us until he thought long and hard about everything and apologized to us.\n\nBill was silent but Jill called us ahs as they left.

Nice move on the 50k.", "NTA, Bill obviously doesn't understand just how much having med school *fully paid for* really set him up for life.

I personally would've handled it differently. Maybe if you could've quietly reminded Bill about how you funded medical school while Sam worked (before things got heated) it could've defused the situation before things escalated.

That didn't help an escalating situation.\n\nHowever, your justification - that you spent a lot on your son early on and now you're compensating for Sam - that addresses the so-called unfairness. \n\nBut the other thing is... your kids are adults. You get to decide how to spend money on your adult children, and if they feel it's unfair, they can have a non-crappy convo with you about it. The way Jill and Bill chose to handle it - snide remarks, accusations, calling you names... they're adults and they're not hurting.  This is like siblings complaining that mom only left the sapphires to Annie when everyone knows the sapphires mean more to Leslie. Get over yourselves, kids.", "NTA  your son's entitled wife seems to be turning him into one though & wifey is definitely a major AH.  I'm sure if you actually did the books on the exact dollar figure that went to each, he would come out ahead even after the check.

Your son's wife is very ungrateful to kick off that 50k wasn't enough especially if you're giving it for a house payment it's basically the same as giving them a house and also YOU'RE GIVING THEM 50K, that's not pocket change that's a huge sum.

But I am curious whether Sam cashed that check or thought it best just to let you have your dramatic moment and refuse the money after Bill had left.", "NTA - Your money. You gift it as you please.

Keep in mind the sums you're talking about are well beyond the grasp of most people to comprehend as \"gifts\", and this alone may cause people to think Y T A.\n\nHowever, as it pertains particularly to you handling Bill and Jill, NTA. You've footed a lot of Bill's expenses \u2014 education, med schools, money, etc. \u2014 whereas Sam was a baller and paid her own way. As you noted you even outright gave him $50K.\n\nNow, the value of Bill's education may approximate the value of Sam's house, so that might make them even-steven. But \"to make it fair\", the cheque of $50K to Sam \u2014 to equal Bill's prior $50K \u2014 is a pretty visible object lesson.\n\nAt the end of the day, you are the arbiter of your family's finances, and Jill can go eat a bag of dicks.

We are probably equal or possibly I'm still a little ahead.  We had different needs, I didn't start driving till my 30s and bought a house later and my husband and I didn't need the help, my brother didn't get an advanced degree.

You established from the beginning the principle that you would give both children what they wanted.

She's a major AH and Bill is an AH too if he doesn't apologize to you guys.", "+undergrad so double it", "Refuse to give Bill anymore money. That might help, I don\u2019t know how much he currently makes as a doctor or whatever.", "How did they overreact to their son being an entitled ungrateful asswhipe.", "I'm  not saying she's a gold digger but if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck.", "From the sounds of it, OP paid for ALL of Bill's education and living expenses up until 1.5 ago when he started his residency.", "I agree what Bill got was very generous. My parents helped with what they could, but I was mostly my responsible for my college/university tuition that grants/scholarships didn\u2019t cover. They let me live at home rent free, which helped a lot. My mom also gave me her old car for free when I finally got my license. But I was responsible for all of my other expenses like my cellphone, car insurance, gas, etc.  I had a part time job throughout the year and would often pick up extra work in the summer.\n\nI still am thankful for the living at home for free thing though as it wasn\u2019t until my third year I actually had to even take out a small loan. Because I had taken a couple years off, less a couple of courses, to work and travel (fully funded by me), I was also old enough where my parents income no longer counted for financial aid purposes and I received a lot more grants vs. loans.  My tuition also became 50% higher in my third year as I had transferred to the university after graduating from a community college with an AA degree.  My mom was initially bent out of shape about me choosing community college instead of the university because of the latter\u2019s prestige factor,  but at the end of the day I saved a lot of money and my degree ultimately comes from the same university she wanted me to go to anyways!\n\nAnd OP is NTA. I would\u2019ve done the same thing tbh!", "i\u2019m sorry but if he is smart enough to\nmake it through med school he\u2019s smart enough to understand how much it costs. let him figure it out on his own", "Nta op tell your son to break up with jill shes there for money and is basically tricking your son to give her money from you thats a bad relationship if i ever saw one.", "NTA, Bill's wife is a massive asshole and he is as well, for allowing her materialistic crap to rule how he interacts with you!", "Nta it seems to me \nLike bill has an abusive/controlling girlfriend", "Nta. I think that you, wife, and Bill should have a conversation (without Jill) and talk about why he was so happy before and what changed so quickly to make him upset.", "NTA, you paid Bill\u2019s FULL EDUCATION including medical school, where Sam paid her own way even though you were willing to pay. Bill was happy for Sam and appreciated the 50k for the down payment as well until Jill decided to start trouble.", "NTA", "NTA but your sons partner is. I've never understood how people such as your son cannot see how blessed they are.  Family always comes before $$$ for us.  \n\n  I'm the oldest of 3 and my siblings/their spouses have good jobs and have made far more $$$ than us.  But, on occasion they have had help from my parents and their respective inlaws.  My wife and I have never asked for any financial help but were fortunate that all grandparents were able to watch our children.  Recently my wife and I decided to do some home renovations and were discussing it with my siblings/parents about the projects and costs associated.  My parents offered us an interest free loan and a cash gift to cover most of the expenses and my inlaws did the same.  I asked my siblings if this would cause any friction between us and both my siblings told me to go F myself and that our parents could pay for everything without any issue.  They know how hard we work and never ask for help.  I actually had tears in my eyes because I was so blessed that they felt that way.", "NTA, well done, I hope your son learns his lesson and leaves Jill", "NTA. You can give/spend your money however you see fit! Talk about looking a gift horse in the mouth\u2026smh", "NTA, Jill is a gold digger, and she is winding up her tinker toy husband to send after your money.", "NTA--Your son is obviously being heavily manipulated and it sucks. Please pull him aside and talk to him without her and talk some sense into that boy. Women like his have an ability to tear families apart for years. Wish you and yours the best in figuring this mess out.", "NTA but im sick to my stomach sitting here hungry and sick on disability while people toss around 50 thousand dollar spite checks lol. getting brakes on my car tomorrow is going to sink me for the entire month ahha. mmm life.", "I can't stop laughing at this post. I love what you did. If it makes us assholes, so be it. Your son got medical school paid for while your daughter worked part time while attending law school. Your son needs to rethink Jill.", "NTA. Note for any readers: make sure your children's and partner's names don't rhyme", "NTA at all. Jill and Bill suck though.\n\nI come from a poor background. Paid my way through everything until I met my husband. He has a more privileged background (no where as privileged as OP), but his parents helped pay part of his education, bought him a car, etc. \n\nI'm thankful for any financial support his parents or grandparents give. I don't ever expect it though. It's their money. My husband is an only child, so he doesn't have a sibling that the money would go to, but if his parents wanted to help his cousin (or anyone else) it's their money! It's none of my business. \n\nBill's cries of favoritism with all you've given him are ridiculous and screams of entitlement. Sounds like they've never had a real problem in their lives.", "Nta she a gold digger. Don\u2019t let them bully and disrespect you.", "If you ever want a middle-aged daughter and some grandchildren, I volunteer to be the best gold-digging, adoptive daughter you could ever choose... Dad.\n\n\ud83e\udd23\n\nNTA", "I hope he can fix his relationship with his family once it inevitably falls apart with this greedy, selfish woman. \nMeanwhile if my parents could have paid for any school at all, much less give me house down-payment money, I would never crack my face to be anything but thankful. Shit, $5k would change my life right now at my big age lol. \n\nNTA. That Jill is terrible.", "When someone shows you who they are believe them I wonder what would happen if your son lost his job how long before Jill is out. I make sure you have an ironclad trust for your money. \n\nThe problem isn't  your son as much as Jill. She has confused boundaries and isn't entitled to what's yours. I have a funny feeling if your daughter's husband or your daughter become very financially successful they would discuss paying you back whereas Jill would tell Bill not to..\n\nI just hope that he doesn't have kids with her otherwise she will use that as collateral", "If she weighs the same as a duck, she's made of wood.\n\nAnd, therefore . . . A WITCH!", "\ud83e\udd86", "Let's get an island we can send them all to.", "She turned me into a Newt!", "\u201cA newt?\u201d", "NTA but you can go ahead and not tip toe around it. She is a gold digger. Facts don\u2019t lie.", "NTA - Bill needs to find a new GF before he marrires Jill.", "NTA. You weren't the most calm and clear, but like... that's some EXTREME gold digging from Jill, I don't blame you", "sorry about your son. clearly picked up by a golddigger and completely ensnared\n\nNTA", "Just throwing it out there  the problem seems to be with Jill being manipulative. Maybe try talking with Bill first but I suspect you won't get through to him now. Probably hear back in a couple of years.", "NTA\n\nSend that boy an itemized bill of all his educational expenses", "NTA... jill should have minded her buisness.  Now that things are even, baring accidents, they should be self sufficient dont you think?", "NTA right up to the very bitter end. Jill is intentionally trying to drive a wedge between him and his family and she has succeeded. It sounds like she probably expected you to dish out more money in the process but Surprise! you didn\u2019t!", "NTA. Sometimes you need a bit of drama to make a point. Hopefully he reflects on this once he calms down.", "Please update", "Maybe if Bill was a child, or maybe even a teenager it would need explaining.  \nBill is an adult and a doctor. This shouldn't have to be spelled out for him.", "That\u2019s what I got out of it, which was probably quite a bit more than the house they bought for Sam by the sounds of it!", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23. Good ole Monty Python!", "Who are you, who are so wise in the ways of science?", "For funsies, I texted my friends who went to medical school and asked what cost more, their houses or the cost of their undergrad education and medical school with books and room and board. ALL of them said education was more expensive. One of them replied, \"Girl, I graduated in 2004 from med school and I still haven't paid that shit off. I still got 80K left. My house at least gets equity.\"", "I mean, there is a floating trash island floating around the Pacific.", "I got better!", "I got better.", "NTA. Jill is the problem here.", "NTA. Your son married poorly.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nit seems quite fair given that Sam actually worked hard for the things she wanted. She never expected anything from you even though you're more than willing to provide. I don't think Bill is an asshole either but Jill is quite frankly, yucky.", "Honestly, tell him that you want to talk about making his future financially stable, but he has to come alone. Write down in advance the money you paid for his premedical and medical school. Plus interest. Plus expected payback time. Then show him the divorce settlement agreements without a prenup. \nTell him you will do his prenup for him for free. \nIf he doesn\u2019t realise what is happening, then you didn\u2019t raise a very bright kid. And it\u2019s ok. But no more handouts, because essentially you are giving money to Jill. NTA", "Right???! I\u2019m in medschool in TX which is the CHEAPEST state to get a degree. I\u2019m coming out with 170k in student loan debt.\n\nThis guy has the audacity to complain? What an imbecile.", "Yea, he\u2019s the one who\u2019s listening.\nHe\u2019d the AH", "Interesting how everyone blames Jill.\nBill is the son, and the totally entitled AH.", "Again, Bill is their son. He\u2019s the total AH.\nYea, he has no taste , but he\u2019s the one buying her bs.", "And after mom and dad paid for his undergrad and everything that goes with it. That is easily the cost of a house if not more.", "Bill didn't get to be the way he is on his own.  His parents raised him to be this way.", "\"She ain't messing w no broke n@ggas...\"", "I know. The sheer audacity to complain after your parents pay off 300k+ in student fees for you. It makes me so mad. How ungrateful! \n\n300k bc anything outside TX this is average medstudent loan debt. And probably atleast 100k in college!", "Law school was the same!"]}
