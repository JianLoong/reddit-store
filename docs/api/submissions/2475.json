And that he still owes me $9,400.  \n\nFinally he gets my parents to call me and ask for the money.  LoL.  I'm already LC with them.  They owe me money too.  They start trying to guilt me. That I'm his little sister and I should love him enough to help. Blah blah blah.  \n\nAfter about a week of this crap I lost it.  I told them fine.  I will meet him at their house and help him out financially for the last time.  \n\nI showed up and we sat down at the kitchen table.
