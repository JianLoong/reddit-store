Curious does the fiance know you're funding the man she's marrying?  Tell the fiance her husband's life line has run out and she might want to find a new one.  Everyone is ganging up on you because no one else wants to become your brothers life line.", "I don't really understand why you're asking if you don't care tbh", "Welp.

Woooooo.", "NTA get your money back and never give out another dime", "NTA.  They have no intention of paying you back.  Let them all know, the money lending is over because nobody seems to understand what loan means.  You are not responsible for subsidizing you family's lives.

Don't give people money like that and then they won't owe you money", "NTA.  Smart girl for getting signed contracts.", "NTA just go zero contact with them all and if necessary, file in court to get him to repay what he owes you. Nobody's doing him any favors by pandering to his financial irresponsibility, and your parents are just horrible for favoring him so much over you, not only in paying for his college and forcing you to take on debt for yours, but now insisting you hand over your hard earned money so he can go play on vacation. You don't owe any of them anything. Feel free to block them all and move on with your life.", "Nta!

That is an insane amount of money! That your family has the balls to demand more from you says a lot about how amiable you've been.\n\nI'm glad you've stopped letting them walk all over you. If there's anyway you can get a case together and take them to court, absolutely do it, don't let that 30k go.\n\nYour family, extended and all, are absolutely atrocious.

Your bro is a greedy monster but both your parents AND YOU have enabled him.", "NTA, clearly...\n1. How is he even getting married, and you should tell his fiancee too.\n\n2. Is this a wierd cultural-issue? I understand helping siblings out, but not what they're spending the money on some random shit. Honeymoon is not needed if you don't have money.", "NTA\n\nLove that you called your extended family on it. \u201cIf family helps family, and you\u2019re family. Hop to it.

Reddit is notorious for making suggestions that people cut off contact with relatives for the moat minor disagreements. While I think most of those suggestions are unrealistic and not at all how the real world works, I think this is one instance where OP would be justified for going NC with her family. \n\nThey sound like a burden and financial/emotional/mental drain on OP. If most interactions revolve around financial demands and guilt trips, I would say ditch these people.

They are negative source of energy.", "Money talk with family never goes well especially when people are living outside of their means.

Leave all of your money to charities or some other member of your family that you actually like and treat you decent.", "As the saying goes: \u201cNo\u201d is a complete sentence. \n\nIf his fianc\u00e9 deserves more than what he can give her, maybe she should find someone better or he should step up and be what she deserves. \n\nDraw your boundaries and decline to discuss them further, and NEVER bend.

The estate must pay the costs of the funeral service and burial or cremation. States may cap these costs, though, so consider a possible cap before planning an expensive service. \n\n>Administrative costs. The estate is responsible for the costs associated with administering the estate \u2014 like court fees, legal fees, and payments to the executor.\n\n>Family allowance. In states where family allowances are authorized, they are generally given high priority. \n\n>Taxes. The estate must file the deceased\u2019s final tax return and pay any owed income tax. The estate is also responsible for paying any property taxes and estate taxes required. \n\n>Medical bills. The costs of the deceased\u2019s medical care are categorized separately from any other unsecured debts (like credit card loans) and are generally given a higher priority for payment. \n\n>All other debts. The executor is responsible for notifying creditors of the deceased\u2019s death, and they generally have between three and six months to make a claim. The executor is not responsible to personally pay any of the estate\u2019s debts unless they were a co-signer or joint owner.\n\n>Note that one common type of debt is treated differently \u2014 mortgage debt (and other liens on real property).  \n\n>Because of the contractual nature of a mortgage, the mortgage company has the right to foreclose on the property and essentially bypass probate to recover assets.", "Honestly, I could kiss you for this!

There will not be an estate, and if there\u2019s a house, the mortgage gets paid off first, then any creditors, there\u2019s an order to how debts are paid and you WONT be first. For all you know, there\u2019s a line of credit or a second mortgage on the house to fund their lifestyle. If they\u2019ve already needed to borrow 30k from their daughter, they are not going to have anything left for you when they die. It was foolish to dip that significantly into your savings for people who will never give you the money back, in life or death. You cannot get blood from a stone, and that\u2019s about all that contract is worth."]}
