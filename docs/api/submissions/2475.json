But my parents love him. He mooches off everyone.  My dad retired a few years ago and can no longer afford to support my brother and his stupidity.  \n\nSo ever the last five years I have lent my brother about $10,000.  And he has paid back roughly $600.  \n\nWell he is getting married and he needs money for a honeymoon. Like $2,000. Which I can afford. But I don't really feel like lending him money I know I won't get back.  \n\nI said \"No\". He kept calling me and texting me saying that his fiancee deserves a good honeymoon and that I should help him out.  I point out that my parents paid for his degree and I had to go into debt to get mine because they had nothing left for me after he took six years to graduate.  And that he still owes me $9,400.  \n\nFinally he gets my parents to call me and ask for the money.  LoL.  I'm already LC with them.  They owe me money too.  They start trying to guilt me. That I'm his little sister and I should love him enough to help. Blah blah blah.  \n\nAfter about a week of this crap I lost it.  I told them fine.  I will meet him at their house and help him out financially for the last time.  \n\nI showed up and we sat down at the kitchen table. I pulled out all the contracts that I made him sign when I lent him money.  I also pulled out a printed copy of the check he paid me the $600 with.  \n\nI said he had a choice I could lend him the $2,000 but they had to pay me back what he owed me first or I could tear up all of his debt to me.  \n\nHuge fight. I'm an asshole for being so mercenary.  How dare I treat family in such a transactional manner. I am a terrible person for letting him think I was going to help.  Did I want to make them homeless by asking them for the $30,000 that they owed me too.  Blah blah blah.  \n\nI said to call me when they decide\n\nNow I'm getting crap from family because they are telling everyone that I won't help out family.  I'm a terrible daughter and sister. So I started asking everyone how much they were going to pay for his honeymoon.  \"No, no we don't mean that WE should help.  Just you. You're his sister\".   \n\nOkay. Which of you guys is paying off what he owes me already.  Radio silence.  \n\nBut I found out from my cousin that they ar all talking about me behind my back.  LoL. I don't care\n\nI feel kind of shitty for getting his hopes up though.  \n\nAm I the Asshole here?\n\n#EDIT.\n\nHe didn't pick so he still owes me money.   I have signed loan agreements with all of them. So, god forbid, my parents die, I get paid before he gets anything from the estate.", "created_utc": 1668619385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ywztyc/aita_for_agreeing_to_help_my_brother_out/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

DO NOT LEND ANY MORE MONEY OUT! I could care less if your brother's fiancee deserves a nice honeymoon. That's his problem and if she doesn't like it, well that's too damn bad.

Your mother and father were hoping to dump your brother off on you.  Your brother is a useless bum enabled by his family. They want to get him married and make it even harder for you to say no. You are the only sane individual in your family. Its outrageous how they practice predatory manipulation on you and accuse you of being coldly transactional with them. Your brothers idiocy, and the complete lack of improvidence he shares with your parents is not your problem. They're gonna put you out in the street hoping you keep their standard of living up. I would give them all the finger and tell them it was nice knowing you. This is  patriarchal entitlement and a sexist based financial abuse scheme.", "NTA.

It showed you are not an ATM.  Let them talk to whomever they'd like.  If you want to put a stop to it - tell them that while it is their right to feel however they want about things - talk about you to other people is not ok.  If you hear from one more person/family member about how awful you are - you'll live up to your reputation and start collections on ALL the money you've lent family.", "NTA. I lent my brother money a few weeks ago and he just paid me back. I\u2019m lucky because I know a lot of people who\u2019ve lent family money and never see it again.
