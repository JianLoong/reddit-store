Perhaps they can install something to block access to adult websites to have peace of mind, without having to go through your messages every week. Or perhaps there are certain things you can do to show that you're mature enough to have some privacy - ask them *why* they think you haven't earned it yet and work out a plan.\n\nIf you think your parents are absolutely not open to that, maybe aks a more open-minded aunt/uncle/family member to advocate for you.", "I don't think you're an AH but I do think you need to talk to your parents about feeling suffocated and needing privacy.

Hell really kids shouldn't have social media anyway and I really do think it's going to be one of those things we look at in 20 years and ask \"why the hell did we ever let kids do this?\"\n\nSo yea, YTA and if they find out expect to lose their trust in whatever device privileges you have now.", "INFO: how are you going to keep up with normal activities on the official one...

Checking to make sure you aren't accessing anything inappropriate or talking to strangers I understand but they are not entitled to read everything you and your friends talk about. \n\nand I disagree that what you did proves that they shouldn't trust you.

Long term is worse.", "ESH but only a little. it is their job to make sure you are safe, and if they do find this phone, they will lose all trust in you. maybe talk to them about cutting it down to once a month if they don't find suspicious stuff going on.

You say in your comments your parents even look at your google searches, WTF!

You think you know it all, but not even most adults understand how much tracking, analytics and other technology is used online to influence them. You\u2019ll get your privacy soon enough - the fact that you want secrecy (via incognito mode for a start) suggests they are right to be worried enough to look at your phone.

My mom won't even let her have a phone, not even a flip phone. So this is a tough situation for you. I know I'll get crap for this, but dear god, do everything you can to hide that new phone, let nobody see it, hear of it, nothing. And don't dare use it, even if you're in your room and they're in the living room, use it when they're at work. Some parents, not all, cause there are crappy parents like my mom, have good intentions. They may not want you to be saying bad things, talking to the wrong people, etc. So that's understandable. If you have something to hide, that's probably a reason for their concerns. But if not, it makes no sense to look through the child's phone every week multiple times a week, or you will start to do things like this.", "YTA you are just giving them more reasons to not trust you.", "YTA. But calling you an asshole is probably a bit much. From what I read your parents are acting overzealous and I understand your need for privacy.

You\u2019re not fully mature until 25 and you are a long way off from that.

I know you\u2019re not malicious in thinking that, it\u2019s part of being 14, but you\u2019re just misguided and not correct. Dump the phone and be happy that you have parents who care enough to look out for you, even if you lose a little in the process.

At 14 you're growing up and beginning to realize things about yourself that you may not want your parents to know, that it might not be safe for you if your parents learned.

Looking through your kids stuff on several occasions is a good way to go about it, doing it weekly is bizarre.", "So what age is watching porn acceptable? 16? 18? Everyone here who grew up with the internet was watching porn well before the age of 18. Sorry, it\u2019s normal.
