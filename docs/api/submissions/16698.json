Even if it wasn\u2019t your intention to manipulate, I absolutely see how they could be under that impression.\n\nI don\u2019t really think you\u2019re an actual asshole, i don\u2019t know why you had to back out, and I know you didn\u2019t intend to manipulate, but I can understand why they\u2019re a bit upset.

You're an asshole acting like they should just give you a place to crash in a hotel room they're paying for. \n\nYou had no place to stay. You had no way of getting back until the public transport started up. You say needed somewhere to crash for safety. You should have looked up transport times ahead of time and made plans for accommodation that you would need. \n\nIt's like that friend who doesn't order food but then eats bites of food that other people ordered and claims they shouldn't kick in for the bill cos they didn't have a full meal's worth.\n\nThree reasons that might lead reasonable people to demand the entire night's room value from OP:\n\n1. If they're sick of your mooching (have you ever tried anything like this before?) and they're deciding to go overboard as punishment for taking advantage?\n\n2. If you were originally supposed to stay all three nights and pulled out at short notice (depending on cancellation policies, ease of booking alternative place at short notice etc)\n\n\nOr\n\n3. If you crashing in their room ruined their enjoyment of the accommodation they'd pay for. Eg a third person in a double bed can ruin everyone's sleep. A person getting up at 3.45am to leave at 4am can spoil people's sleep. Or a person not leaving your hotel room and trying to extend the hangout past its natural end point when it's obvious they're only doing it cos they have nowhere to go.\n\nMaybe reflect on whether any of these fit your actions. Could possibly be why they'd demand so much of the bill from you (which on the face of it seems unfair).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You know you are wrong.", "I'm gonna say a soft YTA, but I get everyone's perspective. You didn't stay for the trip, so I see why you think you shouldn't have to pay. \n\nBut,.... a shared hotel room is not the same as your own. If you booked your own room, with 2 weeks notice you could just cancel, get all your money back, and there's no problem. In this case, you agreed to share a room 3 ways. You cancelling, even with lots of notice, means you're shafting the others who now have to split the same room 2 ways. Honestly, they would be within their rights to hold you to the original plan and say you owe for the booking since it's un cancellable when they are still staying there. But, they didn't hold you to that. They obviously accepted your cancellation, which means paying a lot more than they originally planned..... but then you go and stay for one night anyways. I can see why they would be upset by that. \n\nThis isn't just some cost they were going to pay anyways, so you staying for a while has no cost to them. This is a cost you agreed to share, but then made them pay for entirely, and then you go and use some of the service anyways. The fact that you didn't use much of that service doesn't make it any less of a slap in the face. \n\nImagine it was a pizza. You and one other person agree to pay for a large pizza to share, to eat for a night of video games at his house. You tell them you can't come for games anymore and now he has to pay for the whole large pizza himself. It's already on its way to his place so he can't really cancel. Then, you show up for games anyways, eat one slice, and say you don't owe anything for the pizza. That other person would have a pretty good case that you're an AH.", "This is insane. I am glad they are your ex friends.", "NTA I\u2019m not really following what happened with this event, but you were only in a hotel room for four hours, you do not need to pay 1/3 of the three day hotel stay costs.", "Your ex-friends are stingy AF. If we are being fair, it is an okay ask if they want you to pay  1/3 of a ONE DAY stay. Even that is kinda stingy IMO. \n\nNTA, ask too much.. Get nothing.", "Yiiiiikes! Get new friends asap. Anyone who posts voice recordings of you or shames you online is psychotic. Even if they rightly deserved the money (which i do not believe they do) this would be insane red flag behaviour.", "If they were your friends I would offer to take them to dinner as a thank you for letting you stay.", "So the original plan was for you to be in that room when they booked it, but then you backed out. Then, because of course they were right that they needed to get a room to begin with, you ended up using the room", "You conveniently left out the part where you agreed to split the hotel for the three days and then flaked on them.  And then asked them to let you use it when you needed it.  \n\nYTA", "**INFO**\n\nThere's information that's missing and I'm not able to gather it from all the comments below.\n\n1. You told your 2 friends that you were \"no longer \\[...\\] able to stay at the hotel\". Was the hotel stay fully refundable to them if they canceled the reservation?\n2. Even so, if you had made plans for 3 people to stay at the hotel, it sounds like you all had made plans to go to a concert also, and you backed out of that as well. Could your 2 friends cancel their concert tickets and also get a full refund on those? Your original decision to go with them to the concert and have a hotel could have caused them to make these plans in the first place, and you backing out of one piece of it doesn't mean it's easy for them to back out of all parts of the trip.", "ESH. Them for asking for 3 nights when you only stayed one. You for not planning your time better and crashing with them when you cancelled 2 weeks earlier. I\u2019d continue to offer 1/3 of 1 night and if they don\u2019t accept just ignore them.", "I don\u2019t think you had to pay 1/3 but you did still stay there and didn\u2019t properly plan and still used their room.  So I would think you could\u2019ve offered to get them breakfast or some money", "NTA, if they expected you to chip in, they should have said that when you asked if it was okay. You\u2019re totally not obligated to this. \n\nBlock everything, ignore this petty shit and move on with life.", "NTA. They could have changed the booking after you backed out to a lower cost room. I would Venmo the organizer 1/3 of 1 nights stay. I wouldn\u2019t pay more as you didn\u2019t control the booking and already told them you couldn\u2019t afford it. These people are not your friends.", "NTA but let's do some math here ...Total was 456 for 3 days... there is 72 hours in three days... so 456 divided by the 72 hours would give an hourly rate of ABOUT $6.34 an hour (rounding up)... so $6.34 divided between three people would come to $2.12 per hour per person (again rounding up). You stayed a total of four hours. This means if we are using $2.12 as the hourly rate that individually all three of you would have to pay that means you owe them $8.50... Google says there is a 1 cent euro coin. Make sure when you deliver them their $8.50  in 1 cent coins you empty the bags on their front lawn or coffee table which ever is accessible <3 also forgive me I don't know or care to learn the shortcut for the euro sign on my keyboard lol", "ESH: you backed out of not paying for the hotel ahead of time, then poorly and irresponsibly planned your night so that they were forced to let you stay anyway. \n\nYour friends are assholes for asking for that much, but they\u2019re not entirely wrong for asking for some sort of compensation because you did stay overnight after saying you were not going to be. \n\nDid someone else\u2019s sleeping arrangement get changed because you stayed? Ie. Was someone forced to share a bed/sleep on the floor? They planned for accommodations for 3 people, so If you forced someone else to change their sleeping situation when you explicitly said you weren\u2019t staying, you\u2019re being unfair here. \n\nThis all sounds like a mix of lazy planning on your part and overreaction on theirs.\n\nINFO: have you had monetary issues with them in the past?", "OP was there for maybe 4 hours. Do you expect guests who drop by a room for a few hours top pay as well?  This is insane. NTA.", "Also important to note that OP keeps saying \u201cthree DAYS\u201d. Have you ever heard of a hotel that charges by the day? Lol. It would have been two nights, not three days. \n\nYTA OP, and you know it. You didn\u2019t want to chip in for the hotel so you just had a snooze in it. I have a feeling this is a pattern for you, as evidenced by your friends claiming you\u2019re manipulator. Why didn\u2019t you arrange transport home?", "No, some people are just stupid assholes.", "They\u2019re no longer my friends.", "I didn\u2019t conveniently \u201cflake\u201d on them, I tried everything in my power to go home but it was impossible. They were an absolute last resort. And they know that.", "I went to the concert for a singular day and they went for two days as planned, I did not help with booking the room and did not know they did actually book anything- everything was extremely last minute and I told them I\u2019m not 100% sure if I\u2019ll stay to begin with. I went to the hotel to hang out- time flew quickly and I tried rushing out but unfortunately missed the last transport that I needed- called my mum, and she told me to stay with my friends until it was okay for me to get transport as she couldn\u2019t pick me up. My friends were insisting on me staying and I declined many times until I had to accept.", "They didn\u2019t accept and I proceeded to just block them on all social media.", "I'd love to have you as a customer if I had a hotel. You stay for a couple hours and I charge you for 3 days, just say \"accommodation is accommodation\" and you pay it.", "I have read your post and understood it. \n\n152 is steep (and too much IMO)\n\n Which is why I'm wondering whether your friends justify it as 1, 2 or 3 on my list. Did any of them ring a bell as matching their perspective? \n\nBut as for the \"I tried to go home\" thing - being responsible involves knowing how late it's getting, leaving on time for public transport (running times are on the internet) or having appropriate accommodation arranged for if that isn't going to happen. You should probably apologise for having withdrawn from a hotel stay that you actually (evidently) needed. I'd say a third of the night's cost PLUS a sincere apology for messing them around on the hotel booking, crashing and disturbing them at 4am would be sufficient. But right now you seem very self righteous about something that was clearly your error.", "They were in the room for maybe 4 hours. Out of a three day stay...", "It was three nights. They said in the comments they were at a concert.\n\nPeople who don\u2019t stay at hotels often aren\u2019t used to hotel lingo and so saying \u201cthree days\u201d isn\u2019t unusual. I worked in hotels for 5 years, it isn\u2019t uncommon.\n\nThey had transportation home, they missed their bus and were waiting until 4am for the next one.\n\nTry reading before you comment, it might answer your questions.", "As a hotel manager I'm surprised you're not comprehending the VALUE of the stay. She'd be right to pay that amount if it was only her in that room but it wasn't. There were three other people. \u00a3152/3=\u00a351. The value of that single night going by your should have been split but three people. They rejected her offer of \u00a351 even though that was the value of her stay.", "INFO So you didn't go to the first two days of the concert?", "I'd probably have to go with **NTA** if you offered to pay for your share of a single night. I'm not sure I really understand how they are coming up that you owe them a 1/3 of three days, unless there's other information missing.", "What do they expect you to help pay their rent or mortgage when you hang out at their place, too? That's crap and you deserve better friends.", "You seem to be commenting a lot on this post.", "Why the fuck are you being an asshole? Are you the ex friend with the other guy that's spamming this post? This wasn't personal to you, gtfo.", "I only planned to go to one day of the concert only, they planned for more than one day so I had no reason to stay with them.", "All info is within the comments, they\u2019re trying to get me to pay a 1/3 of the three nights because we had all PLANNED to stay in the hotel together although this was planned it was not booked. It was simply discussed and I backed out before they properly booked it.", "So as long as you pay them for the night you stayed (you really need to do that, sorry) you'd not be the AH but since you keep insisting you don't owe them for that night YTA", "I\u2019d say go farther then that and 4hr/72hrs and then pay them like $20 bucks or whatever it turns out to be. Then the two friends get to split $10. NTA of course but this might make them realize how cheap they are being.", "Fair enough", "Maybe 4hr/68hrs. Remember the difference between the hotel latest checkout and the earliest check-in is normally about 4 hours, reducing 72 to 68\n\nSo 456/3/68x4= \u00a38.9411, so let's round up to \u00a38.95 to split between the 2"]}
