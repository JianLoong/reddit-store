Even if it wasn\u2019t your intention to manipulate, I absolutely see how they could be under that impression.\n\nI don\u2019t really think you\u2019re an actual asshole, i don\u2019t know why you had to back out, and I know you didn\u2019t intend to manipulate, but I can understand why they\u2019re a bit upset.

You're an asshole acting like they should just give you a place to crash in a hotel room they're paying for. \n\nYou had no place to stay. You had no way of getting back until the public transport started up. You say needed somewhere to crash for safety. You should have looked up transport times ahead of time and made plans for accommodation that you would need. \n\nIt's like that friend who doesn't order food but then eats bites of food that other people ordered and claims they shouldn't kick in for the bill cos they didn't have a full meal's worth.\n\nThree reasons that might lead reasonable people to demand the entire night's room value from OP:\n\n1. If they're sick of your mooching (have you ever tried anything like this before?) and they're deciding to go overboard as punishment for taking advantage?\n\n2. If you were originally supposed to stay all three nights and pulled out at short notice (depending on cancellation policies, ease of booking alternative place at short notice etc)\n\n\nOr\n\n3. If you crashing in their room ruined their enjoyment of the accommodation they'd pay for. Eg a third person in a double bed can ruin everyone's sleep. A person getting up at 3.45am to leave at 4am can spoil people's sleep. Or a person not leaving your hotel room and trying to extend the hangout past its natural end point when it's obvious they're only doing it cos they have nowhere to go.\n\nMaybe reflect on whether any of these fit your actions. Could possibly be why they'd demand so much of the bill from you (which on the face of it seems unfair).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
