My father is a gun nut and although I love him I have made it very clear that if he wants to carry a firearm on his person or in his car he can\u2019t do it around me. If you want to come to my house, leave it at home or if you must, leave it in your car and park a couple of blocks away and walk over. My partner agrees.\n\nI was supposed to have him, my step mom and my sister over for Father\u2019s Day, along with my partner\u2019s mother and step dad. He knows the rules, we have gone over this many times and it\u2019s part of why\nI don\u2019t see him very often despite the fact that we live less than an hour apart. I cooked a whole meal and got ready and when he showed up at my house I happened to be out front smoking and I could see he had an IWB holster on because he had his shirt tucked in. I told him that I\u2019m very happy to see him but he can take that off, put it in the car and drive the car out of my sight, or he can do the right thing and throw it in the trash. He asked me if I was really going to do this on today of all days, I said that I didn\u2019t do anything but he chose to bring a gun around me when I don\u2019t want it in my house, he said some homophobic things about how I am a p\u2014-sy and not a real man and my partner said that this is a great example of why we don\u2019t want him to have a firearm around us or around anyone, then my father mocked him by doing the limp wrist, called him the f slur and accused him of \u201cruining\u201d me, and then his step dad told my dad to go f\u2014- himself, and my dad said \u201cmake me\u201d and he said that he would if he wasn\u2019t walking around like a cowboy with a gun and it was just a whole nightmare of toxic masculinity.\n\nNeedless to say, my family left and it wound up being the 4 of us for dinner. My step mother called me sobbing about how I make everything political and I couldn\u2019t just shut up and let my dad be who he is on Father\u2019s Day. I do feel very bad and like I started something, like I said I do love my dad, but on the other hand I do feel justified.", "created_utc": 1687133335, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14czaex/aita_for_not_allowing_my_father_who_is_a_firearms/", "score": 1091, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your dad for pushing your house rules/boundaries and you for demanding someone park blocks away because they have a gun. \n\nHow the hell do you think the right thing to do is throw a gun away, where someone else could get their hands on it. It\u2019s much more dangerous to just throw the gun away than to carry it safely.

Just be prepared for him to never see you again. Also to cut you out of any wills or inheritances and other assets. Again absolutely you don't have to allow it but please never advise tbeowing in the trash or leaving in the car like that.

My father is a gun nut and although I love him I have made it very clear that if he wants to carry a firearm on his person or in his car he can\u2019t do it around me. If you want to come to my house, leave it at home or if you must, leave it in your car and park a couple of blocks away and walk over. My partner agrees.\n\nI was supposed to have him, my step mom and my sister over for Father\u2019s Day, along with my partner\u2019s mother and step dad. He knows the rules, we have gone over this many times and it\u2019s part of why\nI don\u2019t see him very often despite the fact that we live less than an hour apart. I cooked a whole meal and got ready and when he showed up at my house I happened to be out front smoking and I could see he had an IWB holster on because he had his shirt tucked in. I told him that I\u2019m very happy to see him but he can take that off, put it in the car and drive the car out of my sight, or he can do the right thing and throw it in the trash. He asked me if I was really going to do this on today of all days, I said that I didn\u2019t do anything but he chose to bring a gun around me when I don\u2019t want it in my house, he said some homophobic things about how I am a p\u2014-sy and not a real man and my partner said that this is a great example of why we don\u2019t want him to have a firearm around us or around anyone, then my father mocked him by doing the limp wrist, called him the f slur and accused him of \u201cruining\u201d me, and then his step dad told my dad to go f\u2014- himself, and my dad said \u201cmake me\u201d and he said that he would if he wasn\u2019t walking around like a cowboy with a gun and it was just a whole nightmare of toxic masculinity.\n\nNeedless to say, my family left and it wound up being the 4 of us for dinner. My mother called me sobbing about how I make everything political and I couldn\u2019t just shut up and let my dad be who he is on Father\u2019s Day. I do feel very bad and like I started something, like I said I do love my dad, but on the other hand I do feel justified.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I am extremely left leaning and LGBT, believe states like Texas and Florida are downright fascist states, but this is such a chronically online way of speaking. People do not respond or respect this take it or leave it attitude you seem to have.

Leaving the firearm in the car is perfectly reasonable request, but I'd want to ensure the car was in sight, as the last thing I'd want is the gun being stolen, either because the car was stolen or broken in to.
