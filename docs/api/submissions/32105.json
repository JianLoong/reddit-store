Sounds like that's more your speed?", "He'd just end up writing passive aggressive notes about the squirrels fucking too loudly.", "You sound like a fucking weirdo. You aren\u2019t funny just cringy and off", "Invest in a better bed without the box springs might be an option.  Or find a different venue if sound is an issue. I'm so glad I live in my own home where close neighbors are not an issue!", "Nah everyone else should just have to listen to them get plowed.", "You're the one who used the word \"little\" here.    \nThe text wasn't that bad. Who cares? Staying quiet about it doesn't make the bed quieter.", "Very telling that you're getting downvoted to oblivion for this, and by \"telling\" I mean all the downvoters are telling on themselves that they too aren't having sex and are also jealous of OP's housemate", "Oh ffs, it was one time. And you're the one calling it \"loud fucking\", not OP", "Or you know.. they could just be respectful of other people that pay to live in the same situation, by not having annoyingly loud sex.", "If you can hear it from several walls away,  it's loud. And again, the text wasn't that bad. I thought it was dumb to reverse the vote over op's reply. It wasn't bad.", "Sex is certainly a part of normal use and everyone has the right to have sex in a dwelling which they pay for. Let\u2019s not act like hearing sex and hearing footsteps are the same thing though. \n\nIt\u2019d be unreasonable to say \u201cPlease don\u2019t walk around your unit after 9:00 PM because the footsteps are loud.\u201d It\u2019s not unreasonable to ask a neighbor to turn their music or TV down and have an open dialogue about each other\u2019s discretionary activities in a living situation with shared walls.", "I didn't say the text was or wasn't bad. Op is in a basement, their bedroom is most likely directly below the sexers bedroom. That is not \"several walls away\". You're just adding stuff for no reason.", "No omg I wasn\u2019t criticizing you at all, I was just curious bc I read it from a male POV. Just wanted to see if there were any hints I missed", "I mean, he heard a mattress.... if she was a big screamer, totally reasonable to say something. But with mattress squeaking one single time? Overbearing.", "Ok how about \"if it's loud enough to be distracting to the rooms around you.\"", "Ohh good, was worried I was on the hot seat\u2026 I could not find anything that hints at the gender of OP though. I agree it\u2019s important information I simply read it from a female POV."]}
