Broadcasting house-wide noises detailing your personal rhythm. If someone told me they heard that, I'd be *mortified*.

Come on, OP just wanted to be petty.", "Agreed, you can't say that if you live in a shared house or apartment you are never allowed to have sex, and adding to the shame around it is not helpful either. Some countries are more puritanical about sex than others, and attach a latent cultural shame to sex which in my view is unhelpful and unnecessary.\n\nFor me it should no more be commented on than if you hear them exercising, walking around or cooking food.

Sex is normal in life, even when you share a house. A little squeaking is also not anything above and beyond. It's the type of problems that bother when you don't have much else to be bothered with.\n\nEdit: btw, the squeaking doesn't infringe on your privacy or freedom. Unless noise laws are being violated, your freedom is being respected. Your freedom and desire for silence doesn't trump other people needs and wants for sex, intimacy, and normal activities.

I don't know anyone personally that still has an innerspring and a box anymore, so it may not be an easy fix.
