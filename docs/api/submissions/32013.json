It's caused loads of fights. I have always felt like financial burdens fell off on me and that I could never depend on him. With that said, otherwise he is fantastic. We compliment each other well. He's my best friend. For the first 5 years I had a full time job and built up my medical career. During that time he would work for a few months and then quit after a small inconvenience (ie: \"they treat me like I'm stupid\"). Truth is, he has ADHD that he refuses to get medicated for so he goes balls to the wall, burns himself out quick, then gets bored of it and when he becomes bored of it, EVERYTHING pisses him off and everything becomes an issue and everyone is out to get him (victim complex). And I've always just stood right by him. It has caused fights but like.. at some point I just stopped trying to get him to work. It no longer pegged me as being worth the fight and that's when I knew I had a huge problem.\n\nBut he thoroughly surprised me. Back last year he got a job and he stayed there for 8 months. Worked his way up to manager. But the company liquidated and was shut down. And surprisingly he had a new job in a week and again, worked his way right up the ranks. He became operation manager. He really appeared to be doing great! But then, a month ago, he quit out of the blue. Started in with the \"everyone treats me like I'm fucking stupid\" talks again. Has been staying up until 4am playing video games and eating everything in sight and sleeping all day. So this morning I flipped out. He ate all of the leftovers (enough for 5 people) and all of the snacks. There was no food and I just shopped 4 days ago. I told him to get off his ass and get a job and he screamed \"I'm so tired of fucking working and you treating me like a child\". So I calmly said \"you're going to be the reason I have nothing\". He immediately looked gutted, because he often expresses feeling like he's going to fuck up my life and I know deep down he doesn't want that. But instead of apologizing like I normally would, I left. My friend is saying I'm a stupid cunt for saying that because I know it hurt him really fucking bad and he is otherwise a great guy.", "created_utc": 1701288223, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/186ymvg/aita_for_saying_youre_going_to_be_the_reason_i/", "score": 427, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're seeing first hand that he's irresponsible and erratic.  Time to separate until he can show that he can hold down a job for at least a year.  Time for him to get on meds and deal with his mental shit.  Just because you've dated for 6 years doesn't mean you owe him 6 more.  Don't fall for the sunken cost fallacy.  Arguing over finances is just as likely to kill a relationship as infidelity or incompatibility in bed.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Please.  Do not marry or have children with this man until he gets treated or gets counseling for his ADHD.  I am speaking from experience.  Unless he gets treatment, you will always be the responsible one, doing all the mental management and picking up where he drops the ball.  This will be in remembering birthdays, buying presents and as you've seen, buying food.\n\nDo you want to spend your life like this?  He has to grow up and be responsible otherwise you will wonder 10-20 years down the road why you are STILL the adult in the relationship.", "INFO: is this the last person on earth or something?", "\u201cI\u2019m so tired of working\u2026\u201d\n\nYeah, everyone is tired of working. And he *is* a child. \n\nRun. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  What you said was true.  And this situation looks like it needed a harsh dose of reality.    \n\n\nPerhaps if he doesn't want to be treated like a child, he should stop acting like one.  That includes getting himself to get treatment for his ADHD.", "NTA. He is not \"otherwise a great guy\" if he can't be bothered to be a partner in the relationship. Stop making excuses and face the reality.", "NTA\n\nIt's true. He needed to hear it. \n\n>he often expresses feeling like he's going to fuck up my life and I know deep down he doesn't want that.\n\nBut it's not enough for him to get his shit together, just something to wallow in and feel sorry for himself about.\n\nHe may have qualities you really like, but a \"great guy\" is responsible, tries to do better when he's not doing good enough and can keep a job.", "Nta most people are tired of \"fucking working\" but they do it because they have to. Not only is he financially irresponsible, he really needs to address his ADHD to alleviate some of the impact.", "NTA he needs to grow up...\n\nAnd if your friends really said those horrible things I think that you should also look the friendship you have with them. That is no way of speaking between friends.", "Yta if you stay with this irresponsible jerk.  You will have nothing. You are his mommy not his fianc\u00e9. You are kidding yourself if you believe he will ever be a responsible partner.  Do you plan to have kids? Is this the role model you would want for your kids? \nHow long will you put up with being the responsible adult while this immature male takes advantage of you.  No wonder every place he works thinks he is stupid.  He is stupid.  You have been enabling him for 6 years. Why after all these years do you expect him to change.  He has shown you who he is.  Believe him.  He will never grow up and be a responsible man.  He will be this immature boy forever. Why would you want this kind of life forever.", "NTA. \n\nDon\u2019t marry this man. Run.", "NTA.  I think you both needed to hear it.  Maybe you finally saying it, and hearing yourself say it will help you evaluate your relationship.  \n\n\nThere are ways to help those with ADD/ADHD manage without medication, but it doesn't sound like he's developed those techniques or using the myriad of techniques out there to help manage it.  If he's not working on strategies to self manage and/or not taking meds to help him manage then he's only using it an excuse.  What would he be doing if he didn't have you there when he just up and decides he wants to quit?  If nothing changes your just enabling this cycle of behavior to continue.  I say all of this as adult with ADD who didn't find out that was what I had going on until well into adulthood.  It's great for our loved ones to be understanding of us, but we have the responsibility to do what we need to in order to regulate ourselves and adult!", "NTA - it was something he needed to hear.\n\n\"he is otherwise a great guy\"  He also needs to be able to be a full partner and pull his weight financially in the relationship, currently he is not because before every time he quit, you took up the slack.  He needs to grow up and either learn to deal with his ADHD, or get medicated, or accept that his actions really are holding you back.", "He can be a great guy without being a minimally acceptable life partner. He might yet grow up and get his shit together, but he\u2019s got no incentive to do so long term while he\u2019s got OP to provide a soft landing every time.", "NTA. You need to leave him now. What if you have children? What about buying a house, a car, bills, ect? If you get married you will be tied to him financially.  It doesn't matter what his mental health problems are cause he won't do anything about it. He will ruin your life and your finances. Go find someone who's an actual adult and takes responsibility for their actions.", "You're NTA.\n\nThis man is bad for your financial wellbeing and he's threatening your future. \n\nIf he was genuinely concerned about \"fucking up your life,\" he'd handle his ADHD like a responsible adult. Instead, he's happy to freeload off you, then he has the nerve to look hurt when he's reminded that he brings nothing to the table.", "You aren't married yet.\n\nYou have 6 years experience to know how this is gonna turn out.  \n\nThe right decisions are always the hardest\n\nNTA\n\nDump him and your friend.\n\nOnly you are going to take care of you.  He is responsible for himself.\n\nYou're going to have a great life when you get past this.\n\nKeep us posted", "NTA. You say he is great and you are compatible, but honestly I would really recommend couples therapy before marrying this guy. He can't hold down a job and he'd prefer to sleep all day and play video games all night? Is that really who you're prepared to marry? I'm not saying to leave him but he needs to know that yes this does affect you and yes this will be a strain on your marriage.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m going to preface by saying that this is my opinion.\n\nYou need financial compatibility in a relationship, just as you need compatibility in other areas. For example, Would you be with someone who had drastically different views on how to raise children from yourself? Probably not. \nIt\u2019s the same concept here, you don\u2019t see money the same way and that makes for a difficult life. \n\nThat imbalance leads to resentment, on both sides & makes for a bitter relationship long term.\n\nHe sounds immature. I feel like perhaps you already have a gut feeling but might be trying to justify it. I\u2019m not saying leave him, but if you think this is a sign for you to think about your relationship, then don\u2019t ignore it. It will never go away.", "He is going to be the reason you end up with nothing. \n\nWhy do you apologise to him? You are the one holding down a job while he plays video games. \n\nWhat you are prepared to sacrifice for someone like this is the question. Because he doesn't sound worth the effort to me. Your definition of a great guy seems to be skewed. \n\nNTA", "**ESH.**\n\nI am going to be blunt -He is not the reason you're going to have nothing. ***You are.***\n\nI think that most losers would hear a huge KA-CHING if all they had to provide a woman was a little bit of dick here and there and some conversation and that would be enough for her to fund his entire life as an adult. And make absolutely no mistake about this, he is a whole loser.\n\n>\"I'm so tired of fucking working and you treating me like a child\"\n\nHe's gotten away with not working for 6 years.....I don't agree with what he said, but he's letting you know that him working? That's not part of the unspoken deal between you two. And there is an unspoken deal because had you pushed him to be more serious about work and obtaining a career in the past, you know that he probably wouldn't be with you right now. *He's telling you very clearly that he does not expect or want to work.* And he hasn't had to for the first 5 years of your relationship together. These have been the conditions and the dynamic of your relationship with him for 90% of your relationship, and you're effectively demanding that it change complete.y\n\n**So, how is this your fault?** Well, financially supporting an adult to this degree isn't something that happens accidentally. You knowingly took this financial burden on. You bankrolled a man because you probably figured that doing so was the only way that you'd keep him around, or worse, you had lied to yourself and convinced yourself that financially supporting a man was some sort of boss babe girl power female empowerment move.\n\nAnd truthfully? It can be. Plenty of men in high powered positions act as a provider to a woman who doesn't work, and its understood that this is the deal. There's no reason why you can't be a provider too. But for the love god? Learn a thing or two from the men who engage in this and hold him to some kind of expectations and standards to improve the quality of your life. Absolutely every woman that I know with a provider husband has to do so much to effectively justify the exchange, and her role in his life is that she basically makes his life easier my managing all domestic obligations, holidays, birthdays, planning of vacations, etc. **Outside of giving you dick, does your boyfriend do anything whatsoever to improve your life?**\n\nWho proposed?\n\nWho purchased your rings?\n\nWho put the downpayment of your place together?\n\nWho bought every piece of furniture you own?\n\nWho pays for your vacations?\n\nWho has paid both of your bills for the majority of this time?\n\nWho purchases food in your household?\n\nBut let's take it back further - when you met, who paid for your dates? It doesn't sound like he did, I bet it has been you who paid the majority of your dinner tabs with this man.\n\nOP, I am going to be curt. I think that women in lucrative positions such as yourself misunderstood a lot of feminist messaging and are now finding themselves bankrolling a loser and not knowing what to do about this, because unlike men in your same positions at work, you were not prepared for how to spot or deal with a gold digger. And make no mistake, male gold diggers exist - you are with one.\n\nNow, you suddenly want to act like this is a problem. This is a problem that you bankrolled. This is a problem that you paid for up until now. I think YTA because you want to make yourself out to be the victim here when...I mean where is your sense of personal accountability?\n\nI think that this relationship has ran its course, he is never going to be the career oriented man you want him to be. And as long as he's fit, good looking and young? He'll find another empowered woman with a good job that will take care of him. \n\n**The problem here is that if you do not own up to your role in being some loser's sugar momma, you will simply exchange this loser for another one who will also seek to live off you.** \n\nI think you need to either break up with this man or lean into the role that you've been playing this whole time and be his provider, but start holding him to clear standards and expectations on what he needs to be doing in order to improve your quality of life and be supportive.", "NTA HES USING YOU!! He doesn\u2019t love you", "NTA\n\nNobody fucking likes working. So he can suck that up. \n\n\"Hes a great guy otherwise\"\n\nOther than the very, very important part about being a contributing member of society?", "NTA. Truth hurts, and you've hit your breaking point. If he's smart he'll take this as the come-to-jesus moment it is and get to work fixing his issues before you cut your losses and find someone who can consistently pull their weight.", "NTA.  This is a huge issue and will not just go away magically once you get married.   I'm sure you don't want to live like this, so he needs to get himself some help, some meds maybe, and get his crap together.", "NTA but honestly you need to have a long ass think about your relationship. He\u2019s great, yeah yada yada but is this what you want to sign up for, for the rest of your life? The fights? Not being able to rely on him-what will happen if something happens to you? If you guys have kids, or some shit? Can you trust that he\u2019ll step up because honestly it seems he just wants to use his ADHD as a crutch to not work and wants you to take care of him. Which, I could excuse wanting some extra care from you as some disabilities require extra care, but it\u2019s the refusal to get medicated which makes it inexcusable and makes me believe that he just wants to mooch.\n\nHe\u2019s tired of you treating him like a child?
