If you do attend, be a team and support each other.\n\nUnless she lacks self-awareness, she must know that this is not a joyful event for either of you.

You don't even have to bring up her behaviour. Just make it a thing that YOU don't want to do. That way you can make an excuse for both of you. OR, if you have to be there, you can just go do the meet and greet for an hour and head home.\n\nIt just seems like there were multiple ways to handle this and you chose the shittiest one, which was to lie.

You tried to tell her and she wouldn\u2019t listen.  You were put in a tough spot and tried to walk a tight rope.", "I can't bring myself to call you an AH, so NTA. \n\nYou have talked to her about her behavior and she won't change or even talk it through with you by just getting defensive. So, if she won't change, you can't take her. \n\nFor the event itself, if she can't pick up on social cues about who wants to talk to her and who doesn't, that's not great. Add to that she then calls a woman a bitch for days after and that's not an attractive quality and yes, you do have to worry about that getting back to people at your work. \n\nAnd then she spends too much money and is miserable leading up to it, which is no fun. \n\nI think you just tell her- I am sorry I lied to you, I won't lie to you again and that was very wrong. If you need space or something else from me because of the lie, I appreciate that and hope we can rebuilt that trust. \n\nAnd then you also be very clear, that regarding the party, you aren't sorry about not wanting her to come, because you talked to her multiple times, she makes the event miserable, the days leading up to it awful, and the days after stressful. You will not be taking her this year or going forward. You went about approaching this the wrong way but you fully stand by your decision of not wanting her there.", "YTA for lying and hurt your wife\u2019s feelings when all she was doing was trying her hardest for you. Maybe your boss and his wife are the stuck up AHs and to me it seems their opinion of you matters more than how your wife feels. She was clearly just trying her best to impress them FOR YOU. Why are you even attending an Xmas party with people that look down on you and your wife?", "YTA. Talk to your wife and agree on what\u2019s acceptable behaviour from her and intervene when you find her behaviour inappropriate and if at this point it doesn\u2019t work, tell her honestly you don\u2019t want her there anymore and you\u2019ll go alone. Just trying to hide it from her in hopes she never founds out was not a smart move already. You had married her for a reason, so she can\u2019t be that bad 24/7. At least try to get the normal her at the party before deciding to ban her completely and if you do so in the end, it should be upfront.", "YTA. I know you want to focus on the 'did it to save her stress' part over 'did it to save you embarrassment', but here is an insight on that. I am literally that woman. I will panic and stress and overdo it because I don't want to go but feel I have to, no matter how much I'm told I can opt out. And if my partner told me it was cancelled I'd be relieved. But if I found out he'd lied, even if it was purely to spare me, I'd still be hurt and angry. Because then, instead of it being us against this annoying ritual together, it's just me holding him back, it's him not trusting me, it's him giving up on me and pushing through alone. That's hurtful and isolating, and very much against the spirit of any partnership of equals. I'd much rather be harmed by feeling forced into something I don't want to do with him, than by feeling that he sees me as an obstacle to get around.\n\nHowever, the impact on your career - real or perceived - by her behaviour is obviously a consideration. That doesn't mean lying to her, but it does mean sitting down and setting reasonable expectations about any problematic behaviour. Do you have a 'code' you can use to subtly pull her away if you feel she's annoying someone? Do you tell her to stop gossiping when you hear it and does she know why? Has there been any fall-out because of this or is it all in your head? Her getting defensive when you try to talk is...vague and possibly telling. Maybe you need to rephrase it so she doesn't feel like you're attacking her personality - you do seem stuck on how embarrassed *you feel* rather than any actual issues her behaviour has caused, which is fair to consider but not quite the same as having an actual impact on your job - and give concrete feedback on what you expect/need to change and why. You can say \"if you can't adhere to XYZ then it's better to not go\" once she knows *why* it's important, but don't just lie to her.", ">At this point she is hurting my career and hurting herself mentally.\n\nInfo: How do you know she's hurting your career, and also, are you *sure* your boss is laughing at you?", "Esh. Both of you need to grow up. Your wife sounds incredibly insecure & you sound unable to communicate. Neither of you are going to grow as a couple if you can't get over these issues.", "ESH. You tried talking to her about her behavior at the party and she wasn't receptive. That's not okay. This is a work event, and that means it can have lasting effects on your career. I understand your motivation, but lying is not okay either. \n\nIf her main disappointment is that she's missing a big to-do, maybe try to find something else that you o u could both attend that would be more fun, less pressure, and not work-related. Getting all dressed up for a big event can be fun. If that's what she's most upset about, maybe a fancy night out would meet both of your needs.", "No good came from lying either, because she found out anyway (because she's not stupid and knows there is a big cocktail party every year, not a lunch for just employees) and now she's mad at him for lying anyway, and won't trust what he says anymore. He screwed himself by lying. Sometimes the right thing to do in relationships is difficult, but trying to get around discomfort by lying will only ever make it worse when the truth comes out.", "I still think he would have the final say on if she came since it was his works do, and his job he's concerned about due to her behaviour, but overall I agree.", ">I have tried to talk to her about her behavior, but she gets defensive and nothing changes.", "Im sorry but did he have another option she clearly doesn t want to change and he said it always takes a toll on her mental healt I dont really see another way", "That is fair comment.
