If you do attend, be a team and support each other.\n\nUnless she lacks self-awareness, she must know that this is not a joyful event for either of you.

OR, if you have to be there, you can just go do the meet and greet for an hour and head home.\n\nIt just seems like there were multiple ways to handle this and you chose the shittiest one, which was to lie.

So, if she won't change, you can't take her. \n\nFor the event itself, if she can't pick up on social cues about who wants to talk to her and who doesn't, that's not great.

Maybe your boss and his wife are the stuck up AHs and to me it seems their opinion of you matters more than how your wife feels. She was clearly just trying her best to impress them FOR YOU. Why are you even attending an Xmas party with people that look down on you and your wife?", "YTA. Talk to your wife and agree on what\u2019s acceptable behaviour from her and intervene when you find her behaviour inappropriate and if at this point it doesn\u2019t work, tell her honestly you don\u2019t want her there anymore and you\u2019ll go alone. Just trying to hide it from her in hopes she never founds out was not a smart move already. You had married her for a reason, so she can\u2019t be that bad 24/7. At least try to get the normal her at the party before deciding to ban her completely and if you do so in the end, it should be upfront.", "YTA. I know you want to focus on the 'did it to save her stress' part over 'did it to save you embarrassment', but here is an insight on that. I am literally that woman. I will panic and stress and overdo it because I don't want to go but feel I have to, no matter how much I'm told I can opt out. And if my partner told me it was cancelled I'd be relieved. But if I found out he'd lied, even if it was purely to spare me, I'd still be hurt and angry. Because then, instead of it being us against this annoying ritual together, it's just me holding him back, it's him not trusting me, it's him giving up on me and pushing through alone. That's hurtful and isolating, and very much against the spirit of any partnership of equals. I'd much rather be harmed by feeling forced into something I don't want to do with him, than by feeling that he sees me as an obstacle to get around.\n\nHowever, the impact on your career - real or perceived - by her behaviour is obviously a consideration. That doesn't mean lying to her, but it does mean sitting down and setting reasonable expectations about any problematic behaviour. Do you have a 'code' you can use to subtly pull her away if you feel she's annoying someone? Do you tell her to stop gossiping when you hear it and does she know why? Has there been any fall-out because of this or is it all in your head? Her getting defensive when you try to talk is...vague and possibly telling. Maybe you need to rephrase it so she doesn't feel like you're attacking her personality - you do seem stuck on how embarrassed *you feel* rather than any actual issues her behaviour has caused, which is fair to consider but not quite the same as having an actual impact on your job - and give concrete feedback on what you expect/need to change and why. You can say \"if you can't adhere to XYZ then it's better to not go\" once she knows *why* it's important, but don't just lie to her.", ">At this point she is hurting my career and hurting herself mentally.\n\nInfo: How do you know she's hurting your career, and also, are you *sure* your boss is laughing at you?", "Esh.

You tried talking to her about her behavior at the party and she wasn't receptive. That's not okay. This is a work event, and that means it can have lasting effects on your career. I understand your motivation, but lying is not okay either. \n\nIf her main disappointment is that she's missing a big to-do, maybe try to find something else that you o u could both attend that would be more fun, less pressure, and not work-related. Getting all dressed up for a big event can be fun.

Trust is all you got in a relationship and very hard to get back when trust is gone. I\u2019d apologize and either try to make things right or don\u2019t attend event at all. May hurt your career more to go than to stay. If a job though is coming between you and your marriage, you will have to choose eventually", "NTA. Work parties are horrible, and your wife's behaviour around it sounds exhausting. I'm not sure why you are even going to be honest, even if there is the expectation it's not difficult to get out of these things. Food poisoning can be very convenient.", "NTA; it ain't great that you lied, but I get it. How often do you take your wife out to something nice? Is she a house wife, and if so, do yall have kids?  Because if she's got one party to get extra dolled up for every year to go talk to adukts, you bet your sweet ass she's gonna try to make it the party to end all parties. Apologize for lying, explain your points, and make it up to her by taking her somewhere nice.", "NTA", "YTA - What a shitty lie to tell your wife. Do you even like her?", "NTA. You told her, she didn't listen. Actions have consequences", "I'm seeing everyone say NTA ... But I feel like ESH. \n\nYou're working for a boss who only cares about appearances and making himself look good. \n\nNow, I know you said you've spoken to your wife about what she's doing and the effects it has, which is probably the only positive thing I can say to you about this whole post. \n\nYour wife clearly has some issues that needs to be addressed by a counselor if she's getting really stressed weeks before the event and going over the budget for your work's Christmas event. Especially since she hasn't taken what you've said on board and tried to change her behaviour or be more self-aware. \n\nHowever, you lied to your WIFE and insist on working for a place that doesn't give a rat's a**  about you or your wife unless you're bending to their every whim. \n\nYour wife should come before a damn job.

Your love of your career has poisoned your relationship with your wife, who you don't have a single nice thing to say about in your post. Your wife is trying to help you with this thing that means so much to you, and in the end you're lying to her face to keep her out of it. Is she handling it well? Is her behavior at the event really as bad as you claim? Probably not, but I've only got your word to go on. You'll have a lot more time to brown-nose your boss when she serves you those papers, OP. Think very hard about whether your career or your family means more to you, because it isn't unlikely that you'll be making a decision to sacrifice one for the other real soon.\n\nEdit: thought on it awhile - have left original judgment above. You know OP, I don't know anything about you or your wife outside of this isolated event. You're clearly frustrated by this one thing - actually it seems like you both are. Could you just not go? Is it so important for you to attend this event? If it's causing this much stress to you, your wife, and your marriage, then is attending actually worth it? I'm changing my evaluation of this to a really wobbly ESH. Your wife is at risk of screwing up your career, but this wasn't the way to go about fixing that problem. I think letting a work party derail your private life to this extent is really missing the forest for all the trees. \n\nYes, you should be able to attend an event on your own if you want to. Hundred percent. You felt backed into a corner on this one because previous talks with your wife have gone nowhere. Was it right to lie? No. But shit happens, we make bad choices when we're pressured.

I can't explain exactly why but this hit something in me and I think this is one of the most amazing sentences I've ever read. u/toebeantuesday thank you for saying that, again idy why but your whole comment and especially this sentence made my day better. Your amazing and I hope all your days are full of hugs, warmth, laughter and love!!!!", "In this scenario I'm going with NTA, for the sole reason that your wife had a history of grabbing people without their consent and even if the boss's wife was not a nice person, nothing gives your wife the right to put her hands on other people. \n\nBut reading your other comments you have some way bigger problems. Your wife doesn't sound anxious or jealous, she sounds resentful and trying to assert dominance around women she views to be in a position of power. She went out of her way to embarrasse her mother with a stripper, went over and grabbed your mother when when you asked her not to and your mother told her to stop touching her, and she backed your bosses wife into a corner and grabbed her so hard she almost left scratch marks? On top of this your wife thinks all the executives wives and your bosses wife are bitches but she still pushes you to climb the social ladder so that all these other women have to spend time with her accept her behavior? She may have a complicated history with her mother but that does not excuse her what she's doing.

My married sister worries herself sick for any event that is coming, planned or not. She worries months in advance then ends up crying desperately for us to help her get ready. WHY, cause my sister has this thing about wanting to be praised for her physical appearance in every event, wants to be told \"wow you look gorgeous\" and sometimes that is not even enough for her. She feels less than everybody and tries 10x harder to be the best. Love her but the day of any event is a nightmare. It does not help that i can finish getting ready for a major wedding in less than an hour (hair makeup and dress/jewelry) because i can handle multitasking and don't give a fu\\*\\* about people's opinions. She tries to also help the hostess as much as she can to the point that either she is told to please have a seat and enjoy and not worry about the arrangements or they see her as an extra help and pile things for her to do while the rest of the guests are enjoying. She puts herself in this position and gets defensive if we discuss this with her. As her eldest sister, i will drag her back to her seat and sternly tell her to sit and shut up about helping if not needed or asked but she will pout and then jump the minute she sees the hostess leaving her seat (oh, she needs help, she needs me). Recently after a major event (niece's engagement) i stopped her at the middle of the venue and told her to look around, everybody was enjoying while she was running around, even my SIL, the mother of the bride was sitting down chatting with her friends and leaving the work to my sister. I even pointed about my SIL's sisters who did not left a finger to help and were actually smirking at her and looking relaxed. I was very proud of her on the wedding day though, when she spend the day dancing and looking gorgeous because she was not giving herself an ulcer. she did not help and did not worry and ended up enjoying her time. Her smile was the biggest i've seen in a long time. she still relapses but is doing better and getting aware of her self worth more.\n\nSometimes people create problems for themselves and then bitch and moan about not getting the recognition they think they deserve and worse making themselves the laughing stock of the party.", ">who you don't have a single nice thing to say about in your post. \n\nIt's a post about her embarrassing behaviour, why would there be?", "Now I am just picturing Lucille 2 as OP\u2019s wife networking ineptly at the parties, and Lucille 1 in the bitchy moments.", "3 hours later\u2026", "NTA- if you keep him your your bra with his little head sticking out.", "You are not wrong above but you took a cowards way out and betrayed your wife\u2019s trust making you a huge asshole.

Some people are just socially awkward, don't understand social cues, and make others feel uncomfortable. It sounds like OPs wife is like this.
