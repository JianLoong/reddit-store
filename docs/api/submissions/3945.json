So, if she won't change, you can't take her. \n\nFor the event itself, if she can't pick up on social cues about who wants to talk to her and who doesn't, that's not great.

Maybe your boss and his wife are the stuck up AHs and to me it seems their opinion of you matters more than how your wife feels. She was clearly just trying her best to impress them FOR YOU. Why are you even attending an Xmas party with people that look down on you and your wife?", "YTA. Talk to your wife and agree on what\u2019s acceptable behaviour from her and intervene when you find her behaviour inappropriate and if at this point it doesn\u2019t work, tell her honestly you don\u2019t want her there anymore and you\u2019ll go alone. Just trying to hide it from her in hopes she never founds out was not a smart move already. You had married her for a reason, so she can\u2019t be that bad 24/7. At least try to get the normal her at the party before deciding to ban her completely and if you do so in the end, it should be upfront.", "YTA. I know you want to focus on the 'did it to save her stress' part over 'did it to save you embarrassment', but here is an insight on that. I am literally that woman. I will panic and stress and overdo it because I don't want to go but feel I have to, no matter how much I'm told I can opt out. And if my partner told me it was cancelled I'd be relieved. But if I found out he'd lied, even if it was purely to spare me, I'd still be hurt and angry. Because then, instead of it being us against this annoying ritual together, it's just me holding him back, it's him not trusting me, it's him giving up on me and pushing through alone. That's hurtful and isolating, and very much against the spirit of any partnership of equals. I'd much rather be harmed by feeling forced into something I don't want to do with him, than by feeling that he sees me as an obstacle to get around.\n\nHowever, the impact on your career - real or perceived - by her behaviour is obviously a consideration. That doesn't mean lying to her, but it does mean sitting down and setting reasonable expectations about any problematic behaviour. Do you have a 'code' you can use to subtly pull her away if you feel she's annoying someone? Do you tell her to stop gossiping when you hear it and does she know why? Has there been any fall-out because of this or is it all in your head? Her getting defensive when you try to talk is...vague and possibly telling. Maybe you need to rephrase it so she doesn't feel like you're attacking her personality - you do seem stuck on how embarrassed *you feel* rather than any actual issues her behaviour has caused, which is fair to consider but not quite the same as having an actual impact on your job - and give concrete feedback on what you expect/need to change and why. You can say \"if you can't adhere to XYZ then it's better to not go\" once she knows *why* it's important, but don't just lie to her.", ">At this point she is hurting my career and hurting herself mentally.\n\nInfo: How do you know she's hurting your career, and also, are you *sure* your boss is laughing at you?", "Esh.

You tried talking to her about her behavior at the party and she wasn't receptive. That's not okay. This is a work event, and that means it can have lasting effects on your career. I understand your motivation, but lying is not okay either. \n\nIf her main disappointment is that she's missing a big to-do, maybe try to find something else that you o u could both attend that would be more fun, less pressure, and not work-related. Getting all dressed up for a big event can be fun.

It's not to belittle him, it's to protect him because I know my work environment and the people in it. He doesn't. The ONE time I didn't do this, he went up to the CEO and asked why the CEO wasn't at another company function, and actually said the words \"did someone die?\" While he was trying to be funny, the CEO's son had passed.

The best thing about them was usually going to a very nice restaurant and someone else paying. The rest was mostly very boring. I would happily speak to the boss\u2019s wife if she wanted to talk, but never try to monopolize her time. You go, try to look nice and smile and make your husband or wife look good and that you have a happy, stable home life, no big drama to distract from work.\n\nIt\u2019s a play for your team kind of night. The OP\u2019s wife is obviously not good at that and missing some social cues.\n\nOP, you could have just told her the truth.

Your wife chooses to be the rock! She could step out of the way and have listened to your feelings and if not that, logic, of putting your employment at risk.

Small YTA for that, but on the whole it's a small one, or should be when you look at the big picture here. \n\nNo doubt it hurts to be thought of as embarrassing and further how she reflects on her behaviours with your colleagues and whether she now thinks she's gossip. NTA for that coz you already raised it with her several times, she refused to take it on board after you presented it, that's not a you issue, that's her issue! \n\nAs for her own anxiety and mental anguish that's on her to manage, you can't protect her from herself, she needs therapy or to work on herself for that, you can't live her life for her. \n\nThe only thing you could do better or have done, was to simply tell her you didn't want her there and we're going alone rather than lying.
