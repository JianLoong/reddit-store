Maybe your boss and his wife are the stuck up AHs and to me it seems their opinion of you matters more than how your wife feels. She was clearly just trying her best to impress them FOR YOU. Why are you even attending an Xmas party with people that look down on you and your wife?", "YTA.

Just trying to hide it from her in hopes she never founds out was not a smart move already. You had married her for a reason, so she can\u2019t be that bad 24/7. At least try to get the normal her at the party before deciding to ban her completely and if you do so in the end, it should be upfront.", "YTA. I know you want to focus on the 'did it to save her stress' part over 'did it to save you embarrassment', but here is an insight on that. I am literally that woman. I will panic and stress and overdo it because I don't want to go but feel I have to, no matter how much I'm told I can opt out. And if my partner told me it was cancelled I'd be relieved. But if I found out he'd lied, even if it was purely to spare me, I'd still be hurt and angry. Because then, instead of it being us against this annoying ritual together, it's just me holding him back, it's him not trusting me, it's him giving up on me and pushing through alone. That's hurtful and isolating, and very much against the spirit of any partnership of equals. I'd much rather be harmed by feeling forced into something I don't want to do with him, than by feeling that he sees me as an obstacle to get around.\n\nHowever, the impact on your career - real or perceived - by her behaviour is obviously a consideration. That doesn't mean lying to her, but it does mean sitting down and setting reasonable expectations about any problematic behaviour. Do you have a 'code' you can use to subtly pull her away if you feel she's annoying someone? Do you tell her to stop gossiping when you hear it and does she know why? Has there been any fall-out because of this or is it all in your head? Her getting defensive when you try to talk is...vague and possibly telling. Maybe you need to rephrase it so she doesn't feel like you're attacking her personality - you do seem stuck on how embarrassed *you feel* rather than any actual issues her behaviour has caused, which is fair to consider but not quite the same as having an actual impact on your job - and give concrete feedback on what you expect/need to change and why. You can say \"if you can't adhere to XYZ then it's better to not go\" once she knows *why* it's important, but don't just lie to her.", ">At this point she is hurting my career and hurting herself mentally.\n\nInfo: How do you know she's hurting your career, and also, are you *sure* your boss is laughing at you?", "Esh.

You tried talking to her about her behavior at the party and she wasn't receptive. That's not okay. This is a work event, and that means it can have lasting effects on your career. I understand your motivation, but lying is not okay either. \n\nIf her main disappointment is that she's missing a big to-do, maybe try to find something else that you o u could both attend that would be more fun, less pressure, and not work-related.

It's a professional event that can affect your career, and her behavior and lack of openness to feedback don't show that she understands that.", "YTA surprised if you are still married come valentine's", "YTA - you should have spoken to her about it more effectively.", "Agreed. He shouldn\u2019t have lied but just told the truth and refused to take her, \n\u201cThere is a party but I\u2019m going to go alone this year.\u201d\n\nAnd don\u2019t take any discussion about it. \n\u201cI\u2019m going alone. It\u2019s not open for discussion.\u201d\n\nThe fact is he knows she\u2019ll react badly so lied to avoid her reaction, that\u2019s not a good sign. Lying to avoid uncomfortable situations or conversations isn\u2019t good for a marriage. HOWEVER, the wife is a huge AH for pretty much everything. \n\nAs always, I suggest therapy to learn to work through discussing difficult topics", "No boss is going to fire a good employee because their wife is too nice to his wife.", "No boss is going to fire a good employee because their wife is too nice to his wife. It is a once a year slightly awkward experience.", "Totally agree.  What alternate universe have I stumbled into here with these cursed comments.  No wonder narcs find it so easy to do what they do.  \u201cMy wife is so embarrassing.  She tried to make chitchat at an event and spent time on her makeup.  Everyone hates her because this woman I married, have I mentioned how gross she is?  Worst personality ever.  Anywho, I lied to her face.\u201d  Reddit:  \u201cwow dude that\u2019s rough.  Nothing worse than having an embarrassing loser for a wife.  NTA.\u201d\n\nYTA OP.  Hope this helps.", "lmao i mean it's reddit so of course someone had to try and diagnose but no I don't put any pressure on her. It all comes from the way she grew up. She sees herself in competition with other women because she has a mother who sees the world like that. Watching her try to befriend someone who is clearly saying no is heartbreaking to watch, and beyond that it is harming my career potential because those two now hate us", "Everyone always says my boss's only soft spot, one human quality, is his wife. His wife now hates us, so I feel that will effect his opinion of me. I just get the vibe that he thinks it is all funny. I've seen him smirking while his wife was making faces. His wife once complained to him that she is surprised she doesn't have scratch marks from my wife grabbing her arm.", "His wife is a human being who is allowed to have feelings about someone coming on way too strong, following her around, touching her arm when she is clearly uncomfortable. i'd probably be chuckling too if I was in their position. Do you think I'm just going to quit my job which pays for my family to live? Do you have adult responsibilities?", "The same reason most people work a crappy job, it takes money to live. You must be under 18 still.", "Lmao \"learn to communicate\" and \"healthy boundaries\"... Do you need a counselor to tell you it might not be appropriate to be two-faced about your partner's boss' wife and then talk shit about her while your partner is asking you not to?", "I did multiple times as I said in the post. She got defensive and nothing changed", "I don't see how she was doing it for me when I was asking her to stop. If they are such stuck up assholes (which to be fair they are) why cling to her the entire party, follow her around, and harass her?", "Maybe he should\u2019ve told her about the party but also that they would not be going because her behavior was inappropriate and hurting his career", "It's not just a fired/not fired binary though. In a lot of industries and organizations, business decisions and advancement are partially influenced by interpersonal factors. Especially at the higher levels of the company. If OP's wife's behavior at these kinds of events is very socially off-putting, then he may find himself passed over for projects or promotions that are being discussed away from the office because he's not being invited into the inner circle due to people not wanting to invite his wife. Or because his wife is giving them a bad impression that taints their impression of him.", "\u201cHeartbreaking to watch.\u201d  Nice attempt at psychoanalyzing your wife, OP.  Your contempt for her shines through loud and clear.   I don\u2019t believe you\u2019re \u201cheartbroken\u201d in the least.", "How do you know his wife said that?  If everyone at work kisses your bosses ass then what would stop them from talking shit to and about coworkers?", "Perhaps you\u2019re overthinking how much the boss\u2019s wife hates it? I feel bad for your wife", "Because you yourself told her how important it is to curry their favor.", "In her head it maybe isn\u2019t embarrassing to her? Because she\u2019s trying to impress them as you said people try and kiss the bosses ass? I\u2019m assuming your wife is trying to do the same even though she doesn\u2019t see that what she\u2019s doing is harassment she sees it as trying to help your cause. Which is why she\u2019s hurt you called her embarrassing.", "I heard her say that", "And I also told her she is making this woman angry and doing the exact opposite", "She has good intentions but sounds like she should be left home if she can't stop herself with her good intentions.", "Your boss\u2019s wife sounds like a b***h. Your wife seems anxious and pressured by the way she behaves around this time.", "Oh yea definitely but there\u2019s a nicer way to say it I guess:\u2019)"]}
