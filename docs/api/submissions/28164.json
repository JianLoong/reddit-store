Your accommodations are not a preference but a requirement to level the playing field, given your documented conditions. It\u2019s critical that all educators comply with accommodations as they are part of ensuring that you have equal access to education, as per your rights. While it\u2019s understandable that you might feel apprehensive about reporting a teacher, your educational success and adherence to established accommodations should be prioritized", "NTA - the registrar approves the accommodation and he needs to comply. They should make the arrangements for the room, it shouldn\u2019t be on you. Every time you have an exam, they should tell you where to go and have it set up for you with a proctor.", "NTA. Your teachers are required by law to give you these accommodations. Your school can lose funding if this is not followed, so they should take this seriously. You have accommodations for a reason!", "NTA. Those services are there for people who need them. Report him.", "NTA - you should absolutely report him.\n\nAre you making your requests in writing? You should copy someone in administration every time you make the request.", "NTA - \n\nHowever, one important thing to ask is: Are you putting these requests to him in writing as well as talking to him about it directly.  \n\nI would either set up a meeting with him 1:1 or visit him during office hours and explain how you weren't happy with your performance on your first test because you weren't able to have your legally required accommodations and what would be the best approach to ensure you are able to have those going forward.  Depending on the size of the school and the class, your instructor probably has a lot of chaos going on, that isn't an excuse but it does mean that unfortunately you need to be more assertive.  However, working with him once more to try and get your needs met will likely have a much better outcome for you than if you jump to reporting.  Going in and meeting with him while knowing your rights will help strengthen your conversation. \n\nHOWEVER, if you sit to meet with him and he either rejects a plan entirely or doesn't follow through, then absolutely report him, but start with your office of disability services first because they can cite the specific law and regulations he needs to be following.  Document, Document, Document...", "NTA. One college student to another, definitely bring it up with the administration. It's not a matter of convenience or comfort, you require it.", "NTA, asking him three times and still not getting it is enough. The only question is how much of a problem it could be for you if doing this makes an enemy out of him. Bearing that in mind, you might want to talk to him directly and say you really do need these accommodations because it's impacting your score and that if he can't help you, then you have to ask the administration, just to exhaust all available avenues before the nuclear option", "Info:\n\nWas your request in writing or just verbal?", "YWNBTA - you have these accommodations for a reason. If you don;t speak up to someone, then your professor will continue to ignore your requests. He needs to either organize things better, or have his TA (if he has one) take on some of the administrative tasks.\n\nDefinitely report to the administration.", "You are never the asshole for advocating for your needs. Go to the proffesor, if he even remotely ignores your requests, go straight to guidance and the Dean. Demand a retake on the first test, and demand an extension on the semester since he's put you behind. Remember, this isn't high school. You're an adult, and you're paying for a service. Expect them to provide that service or take your business elsewhere.", "Nta and you should do exactly that.", "NTA\n\nYou need those accommodations - if he is refusing to follow them, your best option is to go over his head *so you can get them*.", "I feel you, i worked for years as a note taker for hearing impaired students, some teachers wouldn\u2019t even have a desk or table for me. Report it to whatever office of special needs your school has, this teacher needs a come to Jesus moment, my supervisor would have gone ballistic on them.", "NTA. He needs to comply with ADA state and local laws.  I know it is annoying and shouldn't be your job, but pushing it might make things easier for students that come after you that are in a similar situation.  Good luck, OP!", "NTA: Report him it is a violation of your rights that he is not complying and you have grounds to sue if it is not corrected.", "NTA-what if you had a visible disability, like you were blind, and they refused to provide you with some way to get lecture notes that had been passed out to everyone else in print? What if you were a wheelchair user and they had no way for you to physically get into the classroom? As an adult with ADHD and autism, I understand the pressure to try to fit in, but there's nothing wrong with standing up for yourself. They are in the wrong here, not you, and they need to be held accountable for that.", "NTA but I hate all these \u2018report report\u2019 mobs.  Similar with a lot of HR (not egregious).   \n\nI\u2019d give one final sit down.  State the ask very clearly, explain how not accomodating the first test negatively impacted you.  Say in a direct but not rude way that it needs to be solved for the next test so you don\u2019t have to involve your campuses disability office (or whatever group).  State you want to learn, you value his teaching and you want to make it work.  \n\nIf you get blown off, any retaliation etc then you report.  \n\nBut there is a collaborative vs all out war way to approach this.", "NTA destroy his career i'm so fucking serious, he's an ableist asshole and if he can't accommodate you i hope he crumbles. just be aware that if the school doesn't handle it properly he may just crack down on you harder, since he sounds like a complete dick", "NTA. You definitely need to raise this as an issue.", "NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m also dysgraphic and you have your accommodations for a reason. Good for you for advocating for yourself.", "NTA. If you have accommodations from the school, the teacher needs to honor that.", "If you don\u2019t advocate for yourself you won\u2019t get the accommodations you need. Advocacy does not equal being an asshole. Your professor refusing to follow the guidelines = asshole.", "NTA\n\nProfessor is legally required to provide you accommodation so long it has been filed with your universities disability/accommodation office. \n\nI suggest that you gather and Make copies (print or pdf) of anything that you have in writing like emails showing that you have communicated your accommodations and tried to arrange how you will use your accommodations in that course. So when you go to your universities disability/accommodation office and tell them your situation. They will go to your Professor about this issue and he will try to deny and say that he did accommodation you but you refused to use it but they will not believe that because you have provided emails/writing with time/date stamps proving that he has not communicated, organize, or implement any of your accommodations.", "nta, others might not report and they might end up suffering even more than you are, congratulations on holding it together so far!", "If he\u2019s not dying his due diligence to accommodate you, then he\u2019s an ADA compliance liability. You should absolutely complain. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I recommend that instead you try setting up a meeting with yourself, the teacher, and someone with disability services (ideally your case manager/accommodations person or academic coach). This will allow you to air your grievances with the professor with support from disability resources and creates a paper trail that you tried to resolve things before having to resort to reporting. As someone with autism, ADHD, and dyscalculia I know it absolutely sucks when teachers fall flat due to lack of organization and/or support. I\u2019ve had my fair share of professors that had zero classroom management or proper curriculum.", "NTA and, echoing other comments on here, this is what I would do in your situation:\n\nIf your requests have been over email thus far, include in an email the specific times you\u2019ve requested your accommodations and been denied or ignored:\n\nie. \u201cOn [date], I emailed you regarding [accommodation]. Unfortunately, you [didn\u2019t respond to my request / denied my accommodation]. As a result of my ADA accommodations not being accessible to me, my score on our first test was not an accurate reflection of the work I\u2019ve consistently put into this course.\u201d\n\nIf you want to temper the tone of the email, you could include an acknowledgment that you understand that your professor has many students and a heavy workload, but, as a disabled student, your accommodations are reasonable, necessary, and legally protected. \n\nCC your university\u2019s Disability Services director and/or accommodation coordinator in the email. Disability Services may be able to speak to him on your behalf and sort it out and, if nothing works, you have a paper trail in case you need to take it higher up. \n\nBest of luck and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. University is stressful enough without unnecessary roadblocks like this and it seems like your academic performance is something you\u2019re putting a lot of work into, so I hope it\u2019s resolved quickly.", "How are you going to cope outside of school when businesses may not want to bother with accommodations and just not hire you? ESH", "NTA report him", "NTA.  Report him.", "NTA - report them every time they don\u2019t do their job properly, eventually it might sink in that they should be arsed to do what they\u2019re paid for.\n\nYour accommodations are very reasonable and should be being met.", "NTA.

It's their job to make sure that students get what they need, and can put some pressure on the professor to make sure he's living up to his end of that.

All I needed was to be allowed to have a water bottle and cough drops lol.", "Typically if this is a larger university it is the office that handles Student Disability Services that approve accommodation requests.  Many registrars are not equipped with the knowledge of individual disabilities and what services are needed with them as well as laws to accurately make those decisions.  Sometimes this does fall under the registrar's oversight(smaller schools), but that really depends on the institution, typically however, the registrar oversees the compliance of enrollment, transcripts, and classes.

I am so sick of the ables telling us to do more work to get to the starting line.

They will probably have a quiet word with him and he'll pull his finger out. \n\nIf he doesn't, you're in a much stronger position to be escalating from, because Administration will know it's an issue and they'll be pissed off that he's ignoring them.", "I agree with your response here!  OP doesn't indicate if their requests were spoken, written (with follow-up) or both.  Ideally, they will have been doing both.  If they are all spoken, then given the age of OP, there is a good chance this could be a large and hectic Gen Ed course, in which case asking before or after class could be a piece of information that is hard for a professor to keep track of, hence why there should be written documentation as well of the request.
