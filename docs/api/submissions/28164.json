Your accommodations are not a preference but a requirement to level the playing field, given your documented conditions. It\u2019s critical that all educators comply with accommodations as they are part of ensuring that you have equal access to education, as per your rights. While it\u2019s understandable that you might feel apprehensive about reporting a teacher, your educational success and adherence to established accommodations should be prioritized", "NTA - the registrar approves the accommodation and he needs to comply. They should make the arrangements for the room, it shouldn\u2019t be on you. Every time you have an exam, they should tell you where to go and have it set up for you with a proctor.", "NTA. Your teachers are required by law to give you these accommodations. Your school can lose funding if this is not followed, so they should take this seriously. You have accommodations for a reason!", "NTA. Those services are there for people who need them. Report him.", "NTA - you should absolutely report him.\n\nAre you making your requests in writing? You should copy someone in administration every time you make the request.", "NTA - \n\nHowever, one important thing to ask is: Are you putting these requests to him in writing as well as talking to him about it directly.  \n\nI would either set up a meeting with him 1:1 or visit him during office hours and explain how you weren't happy with your performance on your first test because you weren't able to have your legally required accommodations and what would be the best approach to ensure you are able to have those going forward.  Depending on the size of the school and the class, your instructor probably has a lot of chaos going on, that isn't an excuse but it does mean that unfortunately you need to be more assertive.  However, working with him once more to try and get your needs met will likely have a much better outcome for you than if you jump to reporting.  Going in and meeting with him while knowing your rights will help strengthen your conversation. \n\nHOWEVER, if you sit to meet with him and he either rejects a plan entirely or doesn't follow through, then absolutely report him, but start with your office of disability services first because they can cite the specific law and regulations he needs to be following.

Report it to whatever office of special needs your school has, this teacher needs a come to Jesus moment, my supervisor would have gone ballistic on them.", "NTA. He needs to comply with ADA state and local laws.  I know it is annoying and shouldn't be your job, but pushing it might make things easier for students that come after you that are in a similar situation.  Good luck, OP!", "NTA: Report him it is a violation of your rights that he is not complying and you have grounds to sue if it is not corrected.", "NTA-what if you had a visible disability, like you were blind, and they refused to provide you with some way to get lecture notes that had been passed out to everyone else in print? What if you were a wheelchair user and they had no way for you to physically get into the classroom? As an adult with ADHD and autism, I understand the pressure to try to fit in, but there's nothing wrong with standing up for yourself.

You definitely need to raise this as an issue.", "NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m also dysgraphic and you have your accommodations for a reason. Good for you for advocating for yourself.", "NTA.

Advocacy does not equal being an asshole. Your professor refusing to follow the guidelines = asshole.", "NTA\n\nProfessor is legally required to provide you accommodation so long it has been filed with your universities disability/accommodation office. \n\nI suggest that you gather and Make copies (print or pdf) of anything that you have in writing like emails showing that you have communicated your accommodations and tried to arrange how you will use your accommodations in that course. So when you go to your universities disability/accommodation office and tell them your situation. They will go to your Professor about this issue and he will try to deny and say that he did accommodation you but you refused to use it but they will not believe that because you have provided emails/writing with time/date stamps proving that he has not communicated, organize, or implement any of your accommodations.", "nta, others might not report and they might end up suffering even more than you are, congratulations on holding it together so far!", "If he\u2019s not dying his due diligence to accommodate you, then he\u2019s an ADA compliance liability. You should absolutely complain. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I recommend that instead you try setting up a meeting with yourself, the teacher, and someone with disability services (ideally your case manager/accommodations person or academic coach). This will allow you to air your grievances with the professor with support from disability resources and creates a paper trail that you tried to resolve things before having to resort to reporting. As someone with autism, ADHD, and dyscalculia I know it absolutely sucks when teachers fall flat due to lack of organization and/or support. I\u2019ve had my fair share of professors that had zero classroom management or proper curriculum.", "NTA and, echoing other comments on here, this is what I would do in your situation:\n\nIf your requests have been over email thus far, include in an email the specific times you\u2019ve requested your accommodations and been denied or ignored:\n\nie. \u201cOn [date], I emailed you regarding [accommodation]. Unfortunately, you [didn\u2019t respond to my request / denied my accommodation]. As a result of my ADA accommodations not being accessible to me, my score on our first test was not an accurate reflection of the work I\u2019ve consistently put into this course.\u201d\n\nIf you want to temper the tone of the email, you could include an acknowledgment that you understand that your professor has many students and a heavy workload, but, as a disabled student, your accommodations are reasonable, necessary, and legally protected. \n\nCC your university\u2019s Disability Services director and/or accommodation coordinator in the email. Disability Services may be able to speak to him on your behalf and sort it out and, if nothing works, you have a paper trail in case you need to take it higher up. \n\nBest of luck and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. University is stressful enough without unnecessary roadblocks like this and it seems like your academic performance is something you\u2019re putting a lot of work into, so I hope it\u2019s resolved quickly.", "How are you going to cope outside of school when businesses may not want to bother with accommodations and just not hire you?

I meant it as shorthand because OP stated that they take tests in a designated area. Is it \u201croom 104\u201d or \u201cconference space\u201d or similar? I have no idea. Does she just tell the professor \u201cI need my accommodation\u201d and walk away? Depending on the school / class size, does the professor even know her name?? \n\nI\u2019m not the only one that had brought up if OP had placed the request in writing or not. I\u2019m not the only one that had the thought that the OP should put the request in writing at least once prior to reporting the professor. \n\nI can use google, but how is that helpful in this Specific situation? Will google explain how every single college handles every single accommodation?\n\nEeesh. I\u2019m leaving this particular convo with the experience that people who need accommodations are likely to react with rage and condescension if an unknowing person hasn\u2019t memorized every law about disabilities.", "Honestly, that says a lot about you and your prejudice, if you have one experience with a specific individual shape your opinion on a whole demographic. I think *starfish* was quite insufferable in their last two responses, however, I do understand their frustration. With your latest comment, they sort of proved their point, tbh. As a disabled person, we smell condescension from a mile away. We are confronted with these microaggressions on a daily basis. It is tiring. So again, try to not have one experience with one individual from a certain demographic shape your opinion on that demographic as a whole. That's just ignorant.", "no I dont need the same accomidaitons as OP. wow another really fucked up thing to say. JFC  making assumptions two disabled people with e same dx needing  the same  accommodations. I am disabled clearly you are just stupid. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou and aaaoye can dish it out but you cant take it."]}
