{"id": 14360, "submission_id": "12gdvvj", "title": "AITA for not apologizing to my half siblings for the tattoo I got?", "selftext": "I (20m) got a tattoo a year ago that represents those in my family who mean the most to me. The main focus is my late mom and stillborn sister who died when I was 6. It also has my dad, my maternal grandpa and my paternal grandma. They are the people who mean everything to me and I love so much and wanted to have represented in this. I didn't flaunt the tattoo or anything. It's not something I got to show off to the world. But a few weeks ago I was at my grandma's house and my dad and stepfamily were there along with my aunts and uncles. My 8 year old half sister was tugging on me a lot and tearing at my shirt and actually did tear it when she got it caught in a toy she was playing with and everyone there saw my tattoo. \n\nMy half siblings who saw it who are 8, 11 and 12 and they were very upset. My stepmom also saw it and she was upset to see none of my half siblings or my stepsister (her daughter from a previous relationship) on it. Dad was really touched when he saw it. Didn't seem to sense that the others were upset about it. After I got a new shirt (grandma had clothes there that fit me) I was confronted by my stepmom who asked what the hell that was about and how did I think it wouldn't hurt when they inevitably saw it. I said it was a tattoo on my body and I should be entitled to get what I wanted on it, not to mention the fact I was not flaunting it.\n\nShe told me after being my stepmom for 14 years she thought she would have earned a place on it, would have been given a space as my second mom. But for me to add a sibling who was stillborn, who died when I was so young, while leaving off the siblings I get to watch grow up is cruel and shows that my mom and sister's deaths left me deeply damaged.\n\nSome general added bg info: My dad remarried when I was 8 and my stepsister was 3. She lived mostly with my stepmom when she married my dad but when she was 5 she went to primarily live with her dad who moved out of state and brought it to court to take her with him. I never saw my stepmom as a second mom. She's more like my dad's wife than my mom/maternal figure. I know she wanted to be a lot more to me than that but I never felt that way about her. I am close to my half siblings and love them but it's not VERY close. It's hard to describe but they weren't who I wanted on my tattoo.\n\nSo with all of that, my stepmom wanted me to apologize to my half siblings. She wanted me to make up for hurting their feelings. My dad when he heard about it said it shouldn't require an apology. She asked him what they were going to say to their kids, since they clearly saw living people represented on the tattoo, living family members, and they were not included, which shows them they don't matter to me. Dad told her I was a good big brother to them and that matters more. Some of my aunts and uncles thought apologizing would be a good idea too because my half siblings now have to face a reality that I see them as lesser than a sister I never knew.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681030592, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gdvvj/aita_for_not_apologizing_to_my_half_siblings_for/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is your parents responsibility to help them with their feelings. It\u2019s clear this tattoo is about who you loved when you where a young child, they they where just not in that part of your life.\nAlso, I wouldn\u2019t apologise because it will make out like you regret it and they may then ask to be added to it.", "NTA your stepmom is the only one making this a problem.

Your body, your choice. \n\nYour stepmom has the right to feel hurt. being a stepparent can be hard, and im sure theres a lot of complicated feelings involved when you try to love a child for years and it is seemingly unreciprocated. but she does NOT have the right to make her hurt feelings your problem. she also does not have the right to demand that you make permanent changes to your body and/or apologize for your tattoo which you keep discreet.\n\nyou dont have to apologize to your siblings. just reassure them that you love them and will always be their big brother (if you mean it).", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s your body, your choice. \n\nI would have understood if she was hurt to not be on there if she considered you as her own child and had always tried to make everyone feel part of the family. \n\nBut then you don\u2019t go about and talk that way to your stepson and try to force him to do anything. \n\nYou behave like a grown up which would be being sad about it, having a little cry and maybe venting to your husband.

I have exactly one tattoo, it\u2019s for my eldest, no one, and I mean NO ONE (not even my second born who knows what the tattoo is for) has ever accused me of not loving my second born. Why? Because a picture on my skin means jack all in regards to who I love. Your step mum sounds ridiculous, and I\u2019d be feigning more concerned about why HER children aren\u2019t tattoo on HER. Also the people you listed, some are passed, and others are grandparents who have been with you (I assume) your whole life, there is NO comparison, these are people who you had, and unfortunately likely will have only a limited amount of time with. As for your half siblings being \u201clesser\u201d, sorry but apart from MAYBE the eight year old, everyone else should be able to at least TRY to understand the fact that you lost a sibling, you will never have the moments you\u2019ve had with the other three, with her.

You're the one who has to live with that ink on your body for years, it's your right to decide what stays on your skin.

You cannot expect an 8, 11, and 12yo to not see this as being left out, and to them, you\u2019re probably not their \u201chalf sibling\u201d but just their sibling so they cannot understand why they wouldn\u2019t be held in the same regard as the rest of your immediate family.", "NTA\n\nYou have nothing to apologize for.

The best outcomes come when parents don\u2019t force everyone to fit their vision, but allow them to find their place. But that\u2019s hard, and a lot of parents try to force the issue.
