I mean, first of all, you're married. With kids. What is going on here.\n\nMy spidy senses are tingling, but that's a different conversation. Regardless, your marriage, finances and responsiblies are out of whack. If some good and thorough communication doesn't yeild you some satisfactory results (like, uh, *he* pays for some childcare instead of a gym, since, uh, he already has one in his, uh, own home?) then remember, you are just as powerful and important as he is. Your needs matter just as much as his do. You can make decisions with the same authority as he does.", "NTA. He is taking you for granted and you are rightly upset about that.", "NTA. Omg. If I didn\u2019t get breaks from my child I\u2019d go insane. Is it possible for you to get up at 5:30 and leave the house to get some me time? What is happening now is so unfair", "NTA.\n\nHe found a gym, joined it, and snuck off to it without even telling you, leaving you with the kids. There was clearly some planning involved in that, and he did not include you in any discussion. That is not appropriate.\n\nIs it normal if him to behave this way?", "NTA. Wanting him to be there to spend time with his child and to let you do something for yourself isn\u2019t an outrageous request. If he can workout at home, there\u2019s no use in spending money on a gym membership and if there\u2019s something he needs, spend the membership money on more equipment. I\u2019m also a SAHM. Showering uninterrupted is my only time to relax and not have to worry about my little for 30 minutes.

Tell him the marriage cannot survive if you are drowning this much and that you love him but this is putting a strain on your marriage. Additionally, from a divorced gal who went through the same- just so you know you get way more breaks when you're divorced. It's great. Kid free weekends to do whatever you want is so relaxing. So definitely evaluate whether this stress is really worth it. If I was choosing a marriage like that vs. divorce, I can tell you from the other side definitely divorce. That marriage sounds exhausting.", "NTA, I'm sorry your husband thinks that is acceptable. I'm really worried about you though, you need time for self care and your husband is being really selfish.\nYou would almost be better off divorcing the guy so he has to have the children and you get time to decompress and keep being an amazing mum. That's not what I'm recommending though but a stern talk about his responsibility as A father is, as one day a week for family day is not enough. He doesn't get to be a father only one day a week.\nMaybe even suggest a compromise as if gym is so important to him timewise then an equal opportunity for you to enjoy something of your own so you can both function better.\nDon't let this fester into resentment.

A lot of the workload is on you and that's exhausting. You sound a bit overwhelmed to me?\n\nYes, he works a lot. But he does get breaks and now an additional hour for himself.

What you've described is financial abuse and there are signs of other kinds of abuse here too. Reach out to a local dv support service and talk to them about the way your relationship works. They can give you objective perspective on whether abuse is present and help you plan a path forward. You don't have to leave, but they can help you to access the support you need to move things in a positive direction one way or another. \n\nIf you leave, you'll probably end up with much more money, time and peace tbh. It's seriously worth reflecting on whether this is the life you want, the life you want to teach your children to have when they're grown. Your husband has less than zero respect for you and does not value your contributions to the family. You deserve better and so do your kids. \n\nNTA", "This is unacceptable. He's doing less than a court would ORDER him to do as a father, and they tend to go for bare minimum. He's not \"forgetting\", he just doesn't care.", "Your husband honestly thinks this is fair? The moment you became a SAHM there should have been a change to at minimum account for child expenses, household expenses and medical expenses. Does his family know he pulls this immature BS? \nHe\u2019s only caring about himself here, how embarrassing."]}
