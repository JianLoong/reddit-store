I mean, first of all, you're married. With kids. What is going on here.\n\nMy spidy senses are tingling, but that's a different conversation. Regardless, your marriage, finances and responsiblies are out of whack. If some good and thorough communication doesn't yeild you some satisfactory results (like, uh, *he* pays for some childcare instead of a gym, since, uh, he already has one in his, uh, own home?) then remember, you are just as powerful and important as he is.

If I didn\u2019t get breaks from my child I\u2019d go insane. Is it possible for you to get up at 5:30 and leave the house to get some me time? What is happening now is so unfair", "NTA.\n\nHe found a gym, joined it, and snuck off to it without even telling you, leaving you with the kids. There was clearly some planning involved in that, and he did not include you in any discussion. That is not appropriate.\n\nIs it normal if him to behave this way?", "NTA. Wanting him to be there to spend time with his child and to let you do something for yourself isn\u2019t an outrageous request. If he can workout at home, there\u2019s no use in spending money on a gym membership and if there\u2019s something he needs, spend the membership money on more equipment. I\u2019m also a SAHM. Showering uninterrupted is my only time to relax and not have to worry about my little for 30 minutes.

Tell him the marriage cannot survive if you are drowning this much and that you love him but this is putting a strain on your marriage. Additionally, from a divorced gal who went through the same- just so you know you get way more breaks when you're divorced. It's great. Kid free weekends to do whatever you want is so relaxing. So definitely evaluate whether this stress is really worth it. If I was choosing a marriage like that vs. divorce, I can tell you from the other side definitely divorce. That marriage sounds exhausting.", "NTA, I'm sorry your husband thinks that is acceptable. I'm really worried about you though, you need time for self care and your husband is being really selfish.\nYou would almost be better off divorcing the guy so he has to have the children and you get time to decompress and keep being an amazing mum. That's not what I'm recommending though but a stern talk about his responsibility as A father is, as one day a week for family day is not enough. He doesn't get to be a father only one day a week.\nMaybe even suggest a compromise as if gym is so important to him timewise then an equal opportunity for you to enjoy something of your own so you can both function better.\nDon't let this fester into resentment.

A lot of the workload is on you and that's exhausting. You sound a bit overwhelmed to me?\n\nYes, he works a lot. But he does get breaks and now an additional hour for himself.

Both my next door neighbor and I are SAHMs and both of our husbands consider us equal contributors to the household. The money is our money not their money, do their part around the house and with the kids, etc. \n\nI always feel horrible for the women (and occasionally men) who are not in a good stay at home situation.", "That's a pretty poor generalization honestly, you just think that because you only hear the bad stories. My wife is stay at home and I appreciate the hell out of it, I'm also well aware that I couldn't do it as well as her.  I work in an extremely high paying industry that leaves me away from home (fly in fly out job) exactly half the time and many of my direct reports and superiors have sah spouses. I don't know a single one who doesn't appreciate what they do.  I've had to check myself a few times because I was giving off non appreciation vibes but I do my best to go out of my way to assure her that I massively appreciate the sacrifice she made to stay with the kids.  And I truly mean sacrifice as my wonderful wife cancelled her career (university degree in a very employable stem field) to raise our kids because she wanted a parent figure at home since that's what she had(I was a latchkey kid so was going to support her either way)", "NTA This is financial abuse and you should divorce him. Your job will be much easier because you won\u2019t be taking care of the big baby.", "As of right now it\u2019s not an option unfortunately. The school program im in only selects a certain number of students each year and I really don\u2019t want to mess it up. I wouldn\u2019t be able to work full time and clean the house and do everything I do while also still ensuring I have 12 credit hours. Pile that on top of breastfeeding I would literally never sleep.", "Let\u2019s not shame OP here", "The pill worked for me my whole adult life up until this, we stopped so we could try for number one then I got back on it. Clearly if I didn\u2019t have faith that it would work then I would have used a back up method.", "I missed that comment, that does change things.   He still not bringing \u00ab\u00a0nothing\u00a0\u00bb, but he\u2019s indeed not bringing anywhere close to enough (money, attention, time, basically anything).", "Same! I feel for them. I just see soooo many reddit post with miserable stay at home parents. I'm glad you and your neighbor are exceptions! :)", "Yes, that's why I clarified that I see soooo many reddit posts with miserable stay at home parents with partners that don't see their work as a job and don't see the money as *their* money. I literally only know 1 SAHM in real-life and let's just say, it's not great for her (according to her). Clearly there are others that it works well for! I think it takes 2 people having the mindset that you described. Appreciating each other and both partners contributing to raising the kids, household duties, etc.", "Hopefully they can come to some sort of agreement before the big D comes up.", "Agreed!", "This is so many things\u2026financial abuse, control, him checking out and refusing to do any of the actual work as a parent. You are doing the work of a single parent. I have been a SAHM for many years and my husband has NEVER done any of these things to me. I have always had my own debit card for our shared account. Always had a credit card in case of emergency, and he has ALWAYS stepped up and helped out when needed. We took shifts so both of us got some sleep when our kids came along. He helped with baths, laundry, dishes, meals, whatever was needed to keep things running smoothly. I\u2019m reading this to him and he said \u201cred flags flying here!!! He\u2019s financially abusing her and keeping her under his thumb. He wants to have his cake and eat it too. He\u2019s using work as an escape to keep from having to be a parent, and I would be questioning whether or not he\u2019s being a faithful partner as well. This isn\u2019t a good husband or father. This is someone who has decided they want the \u201cperfect family\u201d persona but doesn\u2019t want to put in any of the work.\u201d", "This is so, so abusive. \n\nSeparate finances makes no sense when one person is a SAHP. You are providing a huge amount of unpaid labor for your household, which enables your husband to work these insane hours. He wouldn't be able to do that without you, so you deserve to be compensated. \n\nHow much would it cost for your kids to be in daycare? He should be *paying you* to watch his children if he insists on separate finances, not making you work part time to pay bills. \n\nIf he can't see that, go back to work full time as soon as you can, so he at least had to split the cost of childcare, and get a divorce.", "This sounds like borderline financial abuse. \u2639\ufe0f", "This is absolutely appalling. \n\nDivorce. You\u2019d get the time you needed and more financial support than you do now.", "I don't think he is contributing enough. It is fair enough for you two to separate finances, if that is what you both want (although since you take on the majority of childcare, I think you are getting screwed), but he should not have separate finances from his children.", "You know that you're not supposed to be alone in cleaning the house and doing everything you do, right?", "Why is your default that all the housework falls on you? This entire relationship sounds horribly one sided and abusive.", "It's not about shaming OP, it's about how this fits the pattern of a shitty husband.\n\nIf he truly cared about OPs wish, he could have worn a rubber.", "I guess you were in the unlucky 1%. I'm sorry about that.", "If he\u2019s going this far out of the way to avoid the kids or his wife, it might be on the table already anyway.", "Separate finances are fine, as long a the sahp gets an allowance equal to the other parent's fun money, and there's a joint account for bills and expenses.", "Nothing borderline about it!"]}
