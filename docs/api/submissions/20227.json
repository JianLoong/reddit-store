I mean, first of all, you're married. With kids. What is going on here.\n\nMy spidy senses are tingling, but that's a different conversation. Regardless, your marriage, finances and responsiblies are out of whack. If some good and thorough communication doesn't yeild you some satisfactory results (like, uh, *he* pays for some childcare instead of a gym, since, uh, he already has one in his, uh, own home?) then remember, you are just as powerful and important as he is. Your needs matter just as much as his do. You can make decisions with the same authority as he does.", "NTA. He is taking you for granted and you are rightly upset about that.", "NTA. Omg. If I didn\u2019t get breaks from my child I\u2019d go insane. Is it possible for you to get up at 5:30 and leave the house to get some me time? What is happening now is so unfair", "NTA.\n\nHe found a gym, joined it, and snuck off to it without even telling you, leaving you with the kids. There was clearly some planning involved in that, and he did not include you in any discussion. That is not appropriate.\n\nIs it normal if him to behave this way?", "NTA. Wanting him to be there to spend time with his child and to let you do something for yourself isn\u2019t an outrageous request. If he can workout at home, there\u2019s no use in spending money on a gym membership and if there\u2019s something he needs, spend the membership money on more equipment. I\u2019m also a SAHM. Showering uninterrupted is my only time to relax and not have to worry about my little for 30 minutes. You deserve an uninterrupted shower and if someone tells you that you don\u2019t, they\u2019re wrong. Mamas need time to themselves to be their best self.

Tell him the marriage cannot survive if you are drowning this much and that you love him but this is putting a strain on your marriage. Additionally, from a divorced gal who went through the same- just so you know you get way more breaks when you're divorced. It's great. Kid free weekends to do whatever you want is so relaxing. So definitely evaluate whether this stress is really worth it. If I was choosing a marriage like that vs. divorce, I can tell you from the other side definitely divorce. That marriage sounds exhausting.", "NTA, I'm sorry your husband thinks that is acceptable. I'm really worried about you though, you need time for self care and your husband is being really selfish.\nYou would almost be better off divorcing the guy so he has to have the children and you get time to decompress and keep being an amazing mum. That's not what I'm recommending though but a stern talk about his responsibility as A father is, as one day a week for family day is not enough. He doesn't get to be a father only one day a week.\nMaybe even suggest a compromise as if gym is so important to him timewise then an equal opportunity for you to enjoy something of your own so you can both function better.\nDon't let this fester into resentment. I wish you the best of luck this can be sorted amicably.", "He\u2019s incredibly selfish and is either not thinking about you at all, or is actively choosing to avoid having to be a dad to the children.

A lot of the workload is on you and that's exhausting. You sound a bit overwhelmed to me?\n\nYes, he works a lot. But he does get breaks and now an additional hour for himself.

I get maybe he works out better at the gym, but maybe not now?", "Everyone needs to look at a compromise. He could go to the gym 3-4 days per week and stay home the other mornings to be available.

That way you can get a part time job (to improve your individual finances and skills), attend appts as needed, practice self care, improve your education etc. Additionally, gyms with childcare (supervised play zones) are the cheapest childcare in the universe!

She herself mentioned that he works 6 days a week all day with a schedule that became much an hour longer.\n\nOP needs time for a break and the husband also needs time as well. Working 6 days a week is crazy and it also affects duties you have at home. Just because the situation sucks doesn't mean the partner that is working is lazy or abusive. Comments like this annoy me because they would talk like this if the genders were reversed. I hate bringing stuff like this up because what I'm seeing are parents that are so overwhelmed with work that one only has an hour of free time and the other has no time at all. Not a partner that is taking advantage of the other that people here are trying to push. While it is important to acknowledge that child care is work, you don't have to ignore that the other party is also working all day.\n\nIf the finances are separate, you can make a joint account that is for the household and childcare that is needed. Also you guys should try and see if there is a solution to his work ours because this is not sustainable on either end and can obviously lead to burnout.
