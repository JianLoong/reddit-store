She nearly lost her life everytime, unfortunately her youngest was a stillborn. \n\nWhen I was three my mother was diagnosed with a medical condition after some close examination from her blood tests and we were all tested and I too have the medical condition. The doctors believe that's why she had rough pregnancies (baring in mind this is all 20+ years ago).\n\nI'm in a long term same sex relationship with my girlfriend and we decided to try for a baby through IVF which was successful. Whilst trying for IVF I talked to healthcare professionals about my mums birthing experience and the fact they think that's why my mother had rough pregnancies and I asked my health care professionals what do they think is the best option. \n\nAfter a long talk with them they think I'll be fine with any option when it comes to giving birth but I need to plan it carefully and have back up plans in case. \n\nI know pregnancies don't always go to plan but I want a home birth plan and I'm not going to take any sort of medication during the birth and my girlfriend is happy with my plan. \n\nWe had a family dinner last night and my sister asked me about my birthing plans and I said I've opted for a natural birth at home and won't use medication during it like gas and air. I know she's scared because of what happened to mum but she kept voicing her opinion and kept asking me to do a c-section or be at least at the hospital. I've told her I made my decision but she kept continuing. Again I know she's scared but it's my birth and my plan and it's also 2023 but she kept going on about it so I told her to back of about my birthing plans then left. \n\nShe hasn't talked to me since last night and usually texts me everyday and now I wonder if I've been an asshole.", "created_utc": 1699172658, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17o7gr5/aita_for_telling_my_sister_to_back_of_about_my/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA. Giving birth is dangerous, both for mother and even more for the baby. Birth is not about \"experience\", is about the end game: a healthy mother and baby. Shit can happen anyway, but in hospital setting the chances of survival for both are much higher. First birth, IVF pregnancy, familial history of health problems leading to stillbirth, what could go wrong?", "YtA. You say that it's 2023 yet you're deciding to not use any of the advantages and advances that 2023 provides when birthing a human. It's not just about you, it's also about the baby. What if they need medical attention after birth?  \n\nYtA", "YTA. You are taking a HUGE risk, and I think you're the asshole for putting your babies health at risk. Your sister is trying to talk some sense into you because she doesn't want you or your baby to die. If something goes wrong, you're at home. There is no medical intervention available, you would have to wait for help to arrive and HOPEFULLY it would make it in time. It doesn't matter if it's 2023, people still die during childbirth. You know why childbirth death rates have reduced? Because we have appropriate places to birth and have medical intervention available to save lives.", "Given your family history why are you the one carrying and not your partner? I\u2019m just curious why your partner would want to put you at risk given the circumstances?", "YTA \nYour sister loves you and has every right to be concerned about your birth plan. Your mother nearly died and one of her babies did die because of complications of the same illness you have.  Why are you risking your own death or the death of your baby birthing at home????? Your baby could be intellectually and physically disabled for life by a birth injury. I'm pregnant too and am at increased risk because of a medical condition- I would never take the risk of a homebirth\n\nWhat makes you think an ambulance will get there in time to save either of you if the worst case scenario happens?", ">The doctors believe that's why she had rough pregnancies (baring in mind this is all 20+ years ago).\n\n>it's my birth and my plan and it's also 2023\n\nWhat makes 2023 so different from the early 2000s? Which scientific leaps have changed the medical condition you have, or the medication you take to combat it? What technological advances connected to 2023 mean that your house is now almost a hospital?\n\nA natural home birth is the same in 2003 and 2023. And if your mum was always in a hospital for her births, then your argument has even less oomph. It's your body, and your child, if you want to have the right to kill you both, you have it. But it's not a great plan.", "Given the issues your mum had, I personally think YTA for putting your own life/ baby\u2019s life at risk for opting for a home birth. If anything goes wrong, it\u2019s going to take a lot longer to help than it would if you were in the hospital where they can just whisk you off to surgery or whatever.", "YTA. You saying \"It's my birth and it's my plan\" doesn't make your sisters concerns any less valid.\n\nBirths go wrong all the time and you have a family history of difficult ones. Speaking as a healthcare proffessional, I do struggle to understand why anyone would choose not to give birth in an environment where immediate, emergency assistance can be given.\n\nEven with a supposed \"back up plan\" there is no guarantee, you could get the right help you need in time if you're not already at the hospital. Carry on by all means, but dismissing your sisters very real concerns is an asshole move.", "I'm voting YTA. Not because you want your sister to butt out of your plans, but because you are being needlessly reckless with the plan you chose. You're putting your life and your baby's life in danger by doing a home birth when you are at a high risk of birthing complications. It's stupid and selfish. What's the point of having a nice home birth if you and/or the baby end up dead? No one is going to have any nice memories if that happens.\n\nAnd you should be aware, your sister is likely withdrawing from you because she is preparing herself for your death. It's very hard to maintain a relationship with someone when they are making choices that are dangerous to their own well-being. It's like being friends with an addict. How can you continue to care for someone who is actively choosing to do dangerous things that put their life at risk? By being close to you, your sister is already anticipating heartache. She's distancing herself because she's very worried and doesn't think she can change your mind. The best thing for your sister at this point is to not see you at all until you've safely given birth, if that's even the result of this.\n\nI don't think anyone here is being abusive to you (OP) by telling you what a batshit stupid plan you've chosen. You and your baby are at risk of dying. 5 minutes is a long time when you're bleeding out or your baby can't breath. Fucking think about it. Is it seriously worth the risk? You have better options here. It isn't all or nothing.", "Oh, this is not an asshole issue. Your body, your life, your choice. Personally, I think you are an idiot.\n\nMedicine progressed so much that the death of a mother or/and child at birth is significantly lower than in the past. Because, health care.\n\nWhy is the act of giving birth that much more important to some women than giving birth to a healthy child and not needing weeks or months to recover and enjoy the said child and motherhood? Baffling. Is this a bragging right thing? Like a female version of \"mine is bigger than yours.\"\n\nYour sister loves you and doesn't want to lose you.", "Exactly! We are in 2023! Go to a fucking hospital and give birth to your baby there!", "YTA. No way is a reputable doctor okay with this plan if you have medical issues making you high risk. They would not be on board with you having a home birth. \n\nYou are literally putting your life and your child\u2019s life at risk, and it\u2019s completely unnecessary. \n\nYour sister has the common sense to see these for the insanity that it is.", "Well, if you want to put your life and your baby's life at risk for bragging rights, go for it, I guess.\n\nYTA but hey, you do you.", "YTA \nGiving birth at home with no medication isn\u2019t a badge of honour. In some circumstances, like  yours, it\u2019s taking an unnecessary risk with your babies life. Giving birth hurts and can be dangerous. Even today, women and babies die. Why would you risk this? You\u2019re not only responsible for your life, but also for your child\u2019s life and that means doing what is best for then, even if it\u2019s not what you want.", "Yeah it is 2023 and medicine has definitely advanced in the past 20 + years\u2026but you\u2019re opting out of all that advancement by choosing to have a natural birth at home. \n\nThat\u2019s fine for low risk pregnancies but yours is confirmed to not be one. It\u2019s highly likely you will need treatment you cannot have at home and if that happens it may be too late to get you to where you need to be. \n\nYou\u2019re not an AH for wanting your ideal birth plan but it\u2019s not worth risking you or your babies life for it.", "It may be 2023 but _your body_ is the same type as humans have had for millennia. You are just as much at risk now as any other woman 1000 years ago. Problems can occur and escalate so quickly that you and/or your child can be dead before an ambulance gets to you, even if the ambulance station is 500m down the road from you. \n\nYou're a high-risk pregnancy. You're risking yourself and your child. It doesn't matter how healthy you are, the amount of things that could go wrong are innumerable in the healthiest, youngest, most robust of women, and by your own report, you may not be one of them. \n\nPlease re-examine _why_ you want to be at home and not in a hospital. Analyze your reasons and then dissect them. Are you scared? Do you think you'll be more 'comfortable' at home? Do you have an aversion to hospitals and drugs because you see them as 'unnatural' and 'unhealthy'? Is it a cost factor? Or, do you just think you'll somehow be a 'better' woman/mother if you have your child 'naturally at home' instead of 'artificially in a hospital'? Is it bragging rights? Are you going to be one of those mothers who smugly proclaims they breastfed their children and who shames any woman that chooses or has to formula feed? \n\nSpend some time considering your motives, and apologise to your sister. YTA.", "YTA, anecdote time. I have an acquaintance, a midwife. She insisted on home birth. As experienced and educated as she was, the baby didn't survive. \n\nHospital was nearby, she just misjudged the situation and then it was too late.\n\nYour sister is worried for a bloody good reason.\n\nI'm so sick of people putting their comfort above the health of babies \n\nPS: I hate hospitals, they're noisy and uncomfortable. But the day or two is definitely worth the decreased risk.", "YTA\n\nThis is not just about you any more.\n\nWhy are you not doing everything possible to ensure your baby's safety?\n\nYou are far too caught up in the whole \"natural\" birth thing. While a natural birth is great when mother has no known complications, especially for a second or subsequent birth, it is not suitable in your case. Stay away from reruns of \"Call the Midwife\" and step up as a mother. \n\nYour fantasy of a \"natural birth\" is trumped by your child's needs.", "YTA. You\u2019re being deliberately obtuse. Your sisters concerns are valid and you were cruel to her. Apologise.\n\nAnd make smarter choices.", "YTA I am always shocked by how giving birth has been tranformed in some sort pf mythical spiritual experience that gives you \"points\" for suffrring the most.\n\nTo me it reads the same as \"I really want to have the full  experience of getting my teeth pulled put, the natural way at home, no doctors of painkillers for me\"\n\nWhyyy", "YTA. You are not the AH for telling her to back off because your decision is final. But omg you are taking a MASSIVE RISK, your sister is concerned for your life and you\u2019re just ignoring her. She is trying to make sure you don\u2019t die, consider that. Home births are risky enough, but for a first time mother with this illness it could potentially be a death sentence. What happens if something goes wrong and there\u2019s no medical professionals?? YTA majorly for treating her concerns as an inconvenience and potentially leaving your gf without a partner and your sister without hers because your too caught up in your fantasy of an \u201cideal birth\u201d.", "Would you do any other medical procedure at home with no professionals or medicine? Why are you willing to risk injury to yourself or your child just to be at home? Why is this worth it? \n\nYeah it\u2019s your birth plan, but with all the risk factors that doesn\u2019t absolve you of any criticism. Listen to your sister, YTA", "YTA  Your child should be your first concern. You seem to be putting your wants above your baby's possible needs. Not a good start to parenthood.", "YTA.     If you have the same condition as your mother, I'm surprised  a midwife would agree to take you as a high risk patient", "I\u2019m sorry but YTA. Both myself and my baby would have died during childbirth if we weren\u2019t at the hospital, and we had no reason for it to be a complicated birth or have any risks.\n\nYour birth plan should prioritize the safe delivery of your baby, and the survival of the birthing mother. Everything else is a bonus, but should not take priority over maximizing the safety of the baby and the birthing mother", "ESH\n\n\nWhile I am a firm believer in birthing in a manner comfortable to the mother, and that your sister should respect your wishes, but... JFC, you already have a family history of this particular issue causing serious problems. Of course, she's terrified, you weren't the only one to witness your mother practically dieing or the loss of a sibling. This is your first birth, you don't know how your body will react. Is your child's life really worth the risk? Because I've lost a child, and there is no loss in this world like it. Gods, I wouldn't wish that on anyone. Is it worth it?

I'm assuming you're in a country(non -US) where home birth is integrated into the medical system?  It sounds like your doctor doesn't actually think what you have is of concern.

When I was pregnant with our first son, I also thought that I wanted a home birth and that I could go on without pain relief. Perfectly fine pregnancy. In the end, my son decided that he liked it to be in  mommy's tummy, and I needed to be induced 2 weeks after the original birth date. I could bear the pain, but not the uncontrollable shaking. I needed a PDA for it to stop (my son's heart rate dropped at one point). \n\nEvery birth is different, but everyone needs a plan b and c in case plan a doesn't work. I am not telling you to get a c-section \"just in case\" because contrary to the common belief, a c-section isn't \"the safe and easy way out\". Normally,  if you want to home birth I would say \"OK, look about a plan b and how long it would take you to get to the nearest hospital and you should be fine if your home is suitable for it\" but given your families history, I highly recommend you to change that idea.\n\nDo your surrounding hospitals offer days to see the labour and delivery ward before giving birth? Or do you have any birthing houses in your area? Even if you still plan to home-birth: Please check them out so that you have an alternative you feel comfortable with.", "YTA. I genuinely don't understand why on earth you would choose not to give birth in a hospital with professionals, knowing your mother's history. And your sister isn't unnecessarily nagging you over some bs. She's genuinely worried.", "YTA\n\nBirth can turn deadly *extremely* quickly. Too quickly for there to ever be a \u201cbackup plan\u201d outside of a hospital with a dedicated OR. At term your placenta can be moving up to 700ml per minute of blood per minute. If you start hemorrhaging from that you could be bleeding at a rate of over a pint of blood a minute. You can generally lose about 5-6 pints of blood before you die. Do the math on if you think an ambulance would even arrive before you died if that happened.\n\nAnd you know what\u2019s a relatively common emergency during birth? Shoulder dystocia. It\u2019s when a baby\u2019s shoulder gets stuck on either the pelvic bone or the tailbone and won\u2019t come out. During this the umbilical cord is often stuck between the baby and the side of the vagina meaning the baby isn\u2019t getting enough blood through it, meaning the baby isn\u2019t breathing. You\u2019re generally considered to have 10 minutes from the time a shoulder dystocia starts till the baby is likely dead. What\u2019s your backup plan for if you need to have an emergency c-section because your baby is suffocating inside you?\n\nEven a normal low risk pregnancy and birth can go wrong in an instant and kill both mother and baby, and you are high risk.

Even if you have a doctor on hand at your house they'd be lacking so many things that they need treat you that that was the unlikely they could save you.

You can\u2019t take it back once it\u2019s done.", "YTA\u2026 not for having a birth plan and asking your sister to butt out.

Giving birth comes with a risk for the mother and the baby at any given time, so be wise and use the technology available to ensure your safety and the baby\u2019s.", "YTA. Home births are for people who have already had an easy first delivery in the hospital. Things can literally go wrong in minutes, and you are risking both your and your kid's lives. Especially considering that you KNOW you have a risk of bad delivery. \n\nWith my first, it went from \"all is going according to plan\" to \"his oxygen is dropping rapidly, we have to cut him out\" in the span of 15 minutes. Shit happens.", "YTA - in the grand scheme of your life with your child, birth is such a small part of it. I know it doesn't feel that way when we are pregnant but honestly, it's not about you, it's about creating a family and caring for your child, birth is one day to get you to what you want for the rest of your life. Be flexible with what you want to get you that life.\n\nPregnancy and birth are one of those things that we put SO much focus and energy on and then in the grand scheme of things, they are such a very small part of our life with our family. My first birth plan was all natural in a birthing center with a midwife and funny enough that was my birth with the most medical intervention and a transfer to the hospital. My next two births I had to have an OB and be in a hospital because of a condition that I found out that I had (which I didn't even know that I had with my first and could result in still birth) but because we knew about it I was able to have  my last two births completely natural with no medication. There are ways to have medication free, natural hospital births. Find a hospital and doctor that you are comfortable with, share your wishes for a birth plan with them, understand your rights and do what is safest for you all.\n\nEdit to add: I say this all without knowledge of your condition and just based on my own experience with birth trauma and what I wish I would have known the first time around. I experienced birth trauma because of my medical transfer and I worked with a counselor afterwards because the birth just absolutely did not meet my expectations. I was just so upset about the whole thing. With my second two my goal shifted from having my birth experience to safely birthing babies. I of course know my rights and said no to an epidural and no to pitocin etc. So even though I was in hospital, I didn't completely compromise on my wishes. Medical advice, absolutely I'll listen but things like pain relief, those are my choices.", "YTA, but so am I. I had a home birth for my first pregnancy and there were no indications of problems during pregnancy or labor, but my baby still died. I wish I\u2019d had her in the hospital.", "YTA\nAt least be at the hospital.\nWhy would you go through all of this and IVF just to risk your child\u2019s life? And your own.\nTo me it seems reckless.", "Where did this insipid idea of home birthing come from? History? (When the infant mortality rate was 50 percent?). Because it's natural? Nature screws us over all the time... we're just in the privileged position of seeing that less and less thanks to medical science.\n\nYou have no history of giving birth, you have no idea how your body will react, you have a family history which seems to put you at elevated risk...and you want to give birth in a space that's not designed for a medical event with a midwife who is not equipped to save your life or the baby's life should it be required. I had a low risk pregnancy - all was fine until the 4th hour. A code blue was sent and my room flooded with doctors within 30 seconds. Can you say the same will happen in a home setting? \n\nWhat's more important than choosing the safest possible setting? The ambiance? Do you think you'll give a damn about the ambiance if something goes wrong?", "You are not unreasonable for making plans for your birth your own way, that make you feel more comfortable. However I'm assuming you do have a contingency plan in case complications arise. Also have your healthcare providers counselled you on when they would need to bring you in to hospital, why, and basically just the circumstances that may lead to you being asked to have procedures that are not currently part of your birth plan? A lot of people get misled to believe that because they have their birthing plan that it's going to work out that way and then are incredibly horrified when it doesn't. I know you probably already know that because of your mum, so that's mostly just a question out of concern. Your sister is also clearly just concerned and that's valid too, especially given your mums history, but you're not an asshole for wanting her to back off. But maybe try and have a calmer chat about it. She doesn't get to dictate your birthing plans but it's also wise to make sure you've got a system in place so emergency services can get to you quickly. Honestly even 10 minutes can be a nightmare in an emergency. I hope everything goes well for you though OP.\n\nEdit: For some reason I thought that you didn't know if you had the same condition as your mum. But if you do, you're making a very risky decision. I mean I'm assuming your docs did their due diligence when they were advising you so I'd hope they are indeed correct that you could at least plan and hope for a home birth without risking your life. Idk I'm reluctant to categorically say you're an asshole without knowing the full details of the medical situation and that is frankly none of my business, and I also have a lot of bias that makes me more inclined towards a hospital birth because I would never want to be further than a short corridor away from the neonatal specialists if anything went wrong. But I feel like there is a lot that is situation and location dependent and also there is sadly far too much variation in the quality of care given by different medical professionals, so while where I live I would absolutely never agree to a home birth, I do get that other people might have trauma and trust issues around their hospital and not feel safe there. \n\nUltimately I don't think I have enough info to judge. I don't blame you for asking your sister to back off but I don't blame her for her concern either. This is between you and your obstetric team.", "There are more and more hospitals that offer outpatient/ambulatory births. You can have the \"home birth\" experience with the security of being already in the hospital in case of complications. They offer water births if the pools are available and you only have your midwife to assist you, all natural unless you ask for pain relieve, you can have a doula too if that's your wish. If everything goes smoothly you go home after a few hours (about 4-6h).

She nearly lost her life everytime, unfortunately her youngest was a stillborn. \n\nWhen I was three my mother was diagnosed with a medical condition after some close examination from her blood tests and we were all tested and I too have the medical condition.

Whilst trying for IVF I talked to healthcare professionals about my mums birthing experience and the fact they think that's why my mother had rough pregnancies and I asked my health care professionals what do they think is the best option. \n\nAfter a long talk with them they think I'll be fine with any option when it comes to giving birth but I need to plan it carefully and have back up plans in case. \n\nI know pregnancies don't always go to plan but I want a home birth plan and I'm not going to take any sort of medication during the birth and my girlfriend is happy with my plan. \n\nWe had a family dinner last night and my sister asked me about my birthing plans and I said I've opted for a natural birth at home and won't use medication during it like gas and air. I know she's scared because of what happened to mum but she kept voicing her opinion and kept asking me to do a c-section or be at least at the hospital. I've told her I made my decision but she kept continuing. Again I know she's scared but it's my birth and my plan and it's also 2023 but she kept going on about it so I told her to back of about my birthing plans then left. \n\nShe hasn't talked to me since last night and usually texts me everyday and now I wonder if I've been an asshole.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I was in a rural area and had planned to deliver in the 20 bed hospital nearby as bigger hospitals were in cities 50 miles away.\n\nThen 1/2 way through my pregnancy, my new OB (previous left area) had a lovely discussion with me. There were a few risks. Did I want to risk being in an ambulance or helicopter (without my partner) while in hard labor, or play it safe and drive earlier in labor to a city hospital just in case?  After a couple early miscarriages, this was perhaps my only chance, so I played it safe.\n\nI contacted several city hospitals and chose one that offered a labor/delivery room option, and infant in-room option after. Well, things did not go as planned. I was able to avoid the pain meds, but needed an IV for fluids. After 36 hours labor my heart started kicking up and a monitor showed baby's oxygen had dropped. I was moved very quickly to the operating/delivery room, and had forceps delivery.  My baby was born blue but thankfully pinked up quickly. They did not let baby room-in with me so that was not as planned either.  \n\nI was disappointed not to have the birth experience I wanted for a very brief time. Then I was just thankful both of us were healthy by the time we went home 3 days later.  \n\nAnd you know what?
