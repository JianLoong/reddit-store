I was there a few months back when he was first born to help with some household things and just to hang out with her, but I hadn't seen her for a couple months because she was so busy.\n\nThe last time we hung out, she asked me if I wanted to hold her son. I said no thank you. It's not that I don't like kids or anything like that, it's just holding a baby makes me incredibly uncomfortable. On top of having a phobia of vomit, it's a huge responsibility that I just don't want.\n\nHer son is about 8 months old now. I was visiting for her husband's birthday party and was glad to be able to catch up. We were having a conversation and she was holding her son when there was a loud bang from the kitchen. Someone had knocked over a pot full of food, but no one was hurt.\n\nMy friend went to go help. She started to hand me her baby and I reminded her that I'm not comfortable with that. It all happened so fast. I started saying \"Oh, no, I'm not...\" and she essentially shoved her son against my chest. Instinctively (like when being handed something you don't want) my arms shot up. My friend let go. The baby fell.\n\nHe was fine, thank god. He was wrapped in a heavy blanket since it's cold outside. But he cried. My friend absolutely lost it, and blamed me for dropping her baby. I didn't say anything at the time because I was just so shocked at what just happened. I just stood there and stuttered while she screamed and rocked him, and a crowd of other party guests formed. All I could keep saying was \"I didn't drop him!\" \"I wasn't ready!\". I ran out of the party and went home.\n\nI feel absolutely awful for the situation, but in hindsight, I don't think I should blame myself. My friend let go of her baby before making sure he was secure. She's the one who dropped him. She's messaged me since, screaming about how her son is going to be brain damaged because of me, and I haven't responded yet.

She was. Then she was no longer holding it. *She* dropped the baby, and is super embarrassed about it. The rage expressed is projection.\n\nJust handing off something, whatever it might be, to someone you know is uncomfortable with the idea of holding it, is irresponsible. How irresponsible scales with the value of the thing. I assume she places infinite value on her child, making it infinitely irresponsible to just sort of hand the baby off like it's a relay stick.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It sounds like there were plenty of other people around who could have either helped with the emergency or held the baby. People need to stop assuming women will happily take care of children.", "NTA.\n\nEven if someone is willing to hold a baby, the person handing it over needs to be sure it is secure. There were other people in the kitchen, your friend didn't need to rush in there like it was an emergency.\n\nI get that she's shook up because baby fell, that's scary. But unless a doctor has told her the child is brain damaged, she is very wrong to say that, and especially to tell others it's your fault. \n\nShe feels guilty because she knows she was wrong. That's no excuse for what she's now saying about you.", "NTA, what happened here is essentially your friend launched a baby at you, and you merely failed to catch it. That's on them.", "Tell her she overstepped your boundaries. You informed her before that you are not comfortable with holding babies. Thank God little man is ok but this is not your fault. \n\nAs a mother I wouldn't push my child off on someone without asking. It's not like the house was on fire or something. She could have carried him with her. \n\nPlease don't blame yourself. It was a miscommunication that resulted in the baby falling. He is ok which is a good thing. Your friend is in shock that her child was harmed in the process of her just dropping her kid on someone that she knows is uncomfortable holding babies.

Not even \u201cjust for a few minutes\u201d. It\u2019s ridiculous that people are trying to say youre TA, not for the baby being dropped, but because you have a personal preference of not being comfortable holding babies. What?? \n\nEven if you didn\u2019t have a vomit phobia or didn\u2019t mind the responsibility, you\u2019re allowed to just not want to hold someone\u2019s child. \n\nRegardless, someone needs to ASK YOU before handing the baby off.

This is all on her.", "NTA, what kind of dunce basically tosses their baby at someone (who it seems has never even held a baby before?) to go check on a spill?? Either she's actually a complete idiot, or she's masking her own feelings of guilt and shame for acting like a complete idiot. \n\nBut yeah, I wouldn't expect the friendship to survive this. If for no other reason than, she will probably never let it go. \n\nAny neurological issue this kid develops in the future, she'll probably blame you for. Parents always try to find a reason or explanation for health issues that are beyond their control because they need to make sense of the world - which is fine, that's a very human thing to do. But based on how this person reacted to this, don't be shocked if you're blamed for little Timmy struggling in Math class in 10 years, or you get an angry call when little Jessica is diagnosed with a seizure disorder.", "NTA. It is the job of the person handing the baby off to ensure the baby is secure before removing their hands. And spilled food isn't an emergency.

It's a paradigm assault for her to recognize that she dropped her own baby and she might never see that. You might need to accept that this friendship will never recover. I would only ever say to her- I'm sorry, I didn't drop him, I wasn't ready. As you have already and leave it at that.  If she tries to paint you as evil to the world, then you will have to defend yourself. I would only say to those people. I understand why she would say that and it's all very awful, but I didn't drop him, I wasn't ready. She suddenly and unexpectedly pressed him to me and stepped off before I had him secured. I understand perfectly how traumatizing this was for her and the child- and for me too, I was there- but it is wrong and unfair to hang this on me and call me out for it. I hope she can find peace.", "ESH. She shouldn't have given the baby to someone who has obviously never held him before, but, damn, you dropped that baby.", "NAH. Revised to NTA.

It's fine to feel guilty, you were a part of the situation. But as you said she dropped him, because she didn't make sure he was secured. I would reply with when you hand someone important, you make sure they have a hold of it before you fork off. Don't contact me again unless it's an apology. But maybe you are nicer than me.", "NTA \n\nI feel like there are a few core tenets that every parent needs to live by. Feed your baby, make sure they're clean and dry, and don't drop them on the ground. \n\nYou're not responsible for that baby's safety in any way unless you previously offer to be. If you'd asked to hold the baby I'd say everyone sucks but you had no interest in doing so. \n\nI tell every friend I have that I don't want to hold their babies. They all respect that even if they have questions why. Your friend should have asked and not basically thrown the baby at you.", "ESH sorry but if you\u2019re an adult with a friend that has a baby you NEED to get over your aversion to holding a child. The kid is 8 months old, not two weeks old, apart from dropping them there isn\u2019t much you can do to accidentally hurt the kid. I would be so sad if I had a child and my close friend refused to even hold them for a second while I need to run out of the room. \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have pushed the kid on you, and she should have reacted better, but come on bro. You can\u2019t hold your friends baby for long enough to set them down? The kid would be in your hands for like a few seconds just find a place to put them. What happens when there\u2019s an emergency and now she knows she can\u2019t count on you? You can\u2019t be surprised if she doesn\u2019t want to be friends with someone she can\u2019t trust around her kid. You\u2019re entitled to never hold a baby, but expecting your friends that are parents to be chill with that is unreasonable in my opinion.", "Light Y.T.A because it seems like your actions were mostly out of instinct, but you don't seem to acknowledge that what you did was wrong.\n\nNormally I'd say your friend was in the wrong for giving you the baby when she knows you don't like to hold them, but she was likely panicking and worried that this was an emergency situation. Was she even aware that \"nobody was hurt\" at that point? She jumped in to help and made sure her hands were free by handing her baby to an adult she trusted, which is reasonable. Most people instinctually grab things that they're handed. She was trying to make sure everyone was safe and okay. What were you trying to do?\n\nEven if you \"don't like\" holding babies, it was more important for you to make sure the baby WASN\u2019T DROPPED. It would have taken you about 5 seconds to either gently put the baby down or to hand them to someone else. This was a moment of panic, and the baby's safety was more important than your general distaste for holding them. It's unclear to me how intentional your actions were, or if you would have taken the baby if you'd had a moment more to think about it.\n\nEDIT: Amending to NAH since at that point it was clear it wasn't an emergency situation, and OP acted on instinct rather than principle.", "ESH.\n\nCan't hold a baby for a few minutes? Really? Or take him and, I don't know, hand him to another guest literally 10 seconds later?\n\nMom is also to blame for not making sure you were actually holding the baby before letting go.", "I have such a different instinct than you that I'm not sure how to answer this one.  If someone shoves a baby at me - crying, vomiting, snotting, drooling - no matter what they're doing, unless I'm wearing a silk dress and scheduled to appear publicly in 10 minutes, I take the baby and hold them securely.  If I'm wearing silk, I just face the sticky parts outward while holding securely and find better arms than mine to hold them.  But generally, clothing washes or dry cleans and baby drool isn't toxic.\n\nI mean these questions kindly, and ask in a spirit of finding information and not trying to poke fun/be mean: are you autistic?  Do you have zero experience with infants?  Is your vomit phobia so strong that even infants/people who haven't/aren't vomiting freak you out?\n\nSoft ESH.  You don't hand over a baby unless you know someone is ready to take it.  On the other hand, babies aren't radioactive dirty bombs.  They're just babies.  You will no doubt be confronted with other babies as your friends have more; might as well get used to them.\n\nHere's a hint or two:  unless a baby has recently eaten and you are burping it, the chances of a baby spitting up (they don't really vomit) are pretty slim.  Also, don't jump up and down, and the baby's stomach will stay where it should.  You can hold a baby by putting its back against your chest, one arm underneath its legs/butt, and the other arm around its chest.  This is best with an older child because they can hold their heads up in this position.  Newborns really have to be either supported on your shoulder or cradled.  You can always ask for a cloth diaper or burp cloth to put over your shoulder if you're really worried about spit up.\n\nThe baby is probably not brain-damaged.  You'll probably not get asked to hold many more babies.  But if you are, just grab it and hold it securely.  It won't hurt you.  You won't hurt it.  They're pretty sturdy, and most of them think new people are interesting.", "ESH. You for not stepping up and sucking it up and her for forcing it on you. You dropped a baby dude. You could have caught him and passed him to someone else. She was in a rush and probably stressed, she was not thinking straight. If she was, she would have given him to someone else.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I rushed her to the Er where I had a breakdown about how I was gonna lose my baby to death or dss. The doctor just kinda chucked, told me my daughter was fine that baby's are actually very durable because of how their skull plates form and fuse, and that he was glad I brought her in cause 90% of parents don't when kids fall out of shopping carts or get dropped.

Like, very, extremely autistic. I am not a parent. I am also (and you might find this surprising, but this is actually VERY COMMON in MANY autistic people) so extremely, naturally maternal in my instincts that many of my mom friends literally come to me for advice because their babies and young children gravitate to me. This is been a lifelong thing for me. I'm like a Disney princess with small animals, but with little kids and babies. Many autistic people actually form strong bonds with small kids because we tend not to put up facades and little children find our natural openness appealing and comforting. Many of us also have a strong \"protective instinct\" because of having been bullied and tend to want to protect other vulnerable people...like babies. \n\nBut also, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, autistic people vary as much as non-autistic people in what we like and don't like, what our strengths and weaknesses are. While some of us may be uncomfortable with babies, it is no more likely than amongst the rest of the population. \"Maternal/paternal instinct\" or the ability to care for or connect with an infant has LITERALLY NOTHING TO DO with the diagnostic criteria for autism or anything related to how our brains work.\n\nPlease stop perpetuating harmful stereotypes about autistic people by asking anyone who seems cold/nervous/anxious around other people, or children, or whatever \"are you autistic\"? There are a million reasons for these things, and autism is rarely the likely one.", "I'm not autistic. \n\nI don't care about drool, stickiness, etc. I do have an actual phobia of vomit, but even that isn't the reason I don't want to hold babies. It's really the responsibility. I don't know how to properly hold a baby, I don't know what to do if they cry. I don't want to be responsible should someone knock into me and the baby is hurt, or should I fumble and drop them (ironic, I know). \n\nI don't think they're radioactive dirty bombs nor did I ever say that, I just really am not comfortable holding a baby. I like babies, I just don't want to hold babies. If I'm asked to hold more babies I will still politely decline. I don't think that part makes me TA.", "So you think OP is also TA because they don\u2019t like to hold babies?\n\nThat\u2019s a weird take. It\u2019s personal preference.", "You jump to autism because someone doesn\u2019t want to hold a baby? Evel Kneivel would be impressed by that leap.", "Baby was never in op arms when it fell, the mother dropped it completely on her.", "What is your reasoning here?", ">Did you even try to hold the baby?\n\nPlease reread the post because you're missing the important info that's already there. Short answer: It happened too fast for me to try. My arms went up out of instinct, and before I could get half a sentence out, baby was on the floor.\n\n>How did you know at the time of the sound that it was just a pot of food that fell?\n\nWe can see into the kitchen from where we were standing. Open floor plan.\n\nI don't understand why your comment is so aggressive. You're making a lot of assumptions and I'm not really sure why. If you wanted more info, like about seeing into the kitchen, you could have just asked.", "If that bad mouthing comes out you can explain your side in a very simple and concise way, and close it out with \"I'm sure it's a very traumatic experience to drop your own baby like that - I know it was traumatic on my end to be involved. And I have no way of truly understanding what she is going through after that, so if putting the blame on me makes her feel better able to cope with it, then I'm not going to begrudge her that.\"", "If you're mutual friends reach out or of you reach out to them, explain what happened open and honestly. You're not responsible for the well-being of her child, she is. If she's worried about damage she should take him to the hospital. She's bears responsibility in this since she failed to make sure he was secure. She's likely feeling guilt about it but it's literally not your fault. As for what anyone outside the party thinks, that's out of your control. Honestly, what anyone thinks is out your control and you should try (easy to say, I know) not to worry about it. Your real friends will hear you out.\n\nEdited for typo", "She is totally projecting and offloading her guilt onto you. There will be no convincing that you can do. She mentally can't right now. I've encountered many people who have blinders like this when they have done something wrong it's too damaging to their identity (New mom) to have even possibly caused harm to something they care about so much. Maybe she will in time recognize this but let her walk that journey on her own. \n\nNTA", "I wouldn't voluntarily reach out just to explain. I wouldn't even talk about it unless they brought it up. Then I would explain.", "Yeah I figured she was just being dramatic. And if she is seriously worried, she absolutely would take him in to be checked. She's embarrassed that she was seen being irresponsible and is trying to blame it on you to save face. I'm so sorry you're being treated this way.", "If OP isn't comfortable they shouldn't be forced to hold a baby. I always decline hold a baby for this very reason.", "I agree that she's an AH. Hence the rating. But just throwing your arms up and letting the kid drop? How is that not also an AH move?", "There is a difference between \u201cI don\u2019t like holding babies\u201d and \u201cI refuse to hold your kid to the point where I\u2019d let the baby fall to the floor.\u201d If your natural instinct when someone hands you a baby is to throw your hands up and say no, you can\u2019t be shocked when a parent doesn\u2019t want to be around you anymore.", "Then I think this is closer to a NAH situation actually. Since she was just helping to clean, there was no need for her to be so rushed in handing off the baby. But I think you both acted instinctually.\n\nAlthough even if it wasn't a \"true emergency\", I think once she started to let go of the baby then it *became* a true emergency. Did you have time to try to catch the baby? Or did you stay hands up as it was falling?\n\nI think if you want to salvage the friendship, when you talk to her about it you should focus on the lack of time and instinctual actions rather than the fact that you don't enjoy holding babies. If you do, she'll probably think you did it on purpose.", "I apologize for offending you.  I should have explained what I was talking about.  I didn't mean to imply that people who are autistic are weird; I don't think people who are autistic are any more weird than people who are not autistic.\n\nHere is the explanation I should have given:  I have a friend who is autistic.  One of the things she associates with her autism is a dislike for fluids like drool.  They're sticky and thick and she can't stand touching them.  Babies extrude weird substances on a regular basis.  If a baby is in the teething stage, when they're most likely to drool, she doesn't want anything to do with them.  That's what was on my mind when I asked that.\n\nIn any event, I deserved your correction.  Thank you for reminding me to watch my language and assumptions.  I've taken your words to heart.", "You\u2019re not required to hold babies but \u2026 the proper way to hold a baby? Really? If you aren\u2019t suffocating it or dangling it by a limb, however you\u2019re holding it is just fine for a few minutes.", "Well, I take phobias seriously, so a vomit phobia ranks as a reason to not want to hold a baby in my book, especially if you aren't familiar enough with babies to know that what seems like vomit is really just the baby spitting up, which isn't really vomit.  The radioactive dirty bomb phrasing was mild hyperbole.\n\nPolitely declining to hold a baby doesn't make you TA.  Having a baby thrust at you when you weren't ready or willing to hold the baby and you reacting as though someone was handing you something dangerous that would hurt you (is that better than radioactive dirty bomb?) is what makes me say the situation is a soft everyone sucks here.  A pot falling wasn't such an emergency that she had to dump the baby on the nearest person with arms.  A baby isn't such a delicate or dangerous thing that you had to react by jumping back so it didn't touch you.  You might want to ask someone to show you how to hold a baby (though there's really no wrong way as long as you support the head of a newborn) so you know in case there's a real emergency, like a pot of boiling water fell and there were serious burns and she really DID need to hand off the baby and help deal with things.\n\nYou can politely decline to hold every single baby offered to you; I agree that part doesn't make you TA.", "Not what I said.  I said it's a soft everyone sucks (so no one reaches TA level) because the mom didn't really need to hand off the baby on an emergency basis; it doesn't sound like anyone was hurt.  The OP threw up his hands and leapt away from the baby rather than just grabbing it and then finding someone else to take it.", "No.  I thought mild autism might be a possibility because babies secrete all kinds of bodily fluids (even ignoring products of digestion) and I have a mildly autistic friend who really hates things with those textures.  She hates to hold babies because drool freaks her out.  That is a legitimate reason not to want to hold a baby.  OP has a vomit phobia.  That's also a legitimate reason not to want to hold a baby.", "I agree with this wording for an explanation.", "I can just imagine it from their perspective. They didn't see the failed handoff, only the baby on the ground, mother screaming, and me with my hands up in the air, stuttering. \n\nI feel like I should reach out and explain, but I don't know if that would just make me look bad, like I'm trying to blame the mother. \n\nAt least one reached out during the party, but only to let me know the baby stopped crying and looks fine... I may lose many friends over this.", "Thank you. \n\nIt seems like the majority of the E.S.H or Y.T.A comments are from people that think I need to be willing to hold the baby. \n\nThat's not what I'm asking about here, and I also think it's super weird.", "I didn't do that *on purpose.* If I had been more prepared, I would have held them.", "I think it was an instinct rather than a thought. Like the instinct of something shoved at you. Not a conscious understanding of a baby being put into op\u2019s care/arms", "I didn't intentionally let him fall to the floor. \n\nIf there was a true emergency and I had been more prepared past her shoving him onto me, I would hold him,\n\nArms went up out of instinct for being handed something I didn't want. I don't really mind at this point if she doesn't want to be around me though.", "I'm told you need to support the head, neck, make sure they don't wiggle, etc.. ?\n\nLook, I just don't want to do it, I don't want the responsibility. I think it's weird that people are so insistent on me holding their babies when I say I'm not comfortable with it, even for a few minutes.", "I dont think they \u201cleapt away\u201d from the baby as much as didnt have time to react.", "You might very well lose people you know  and that sucks but if they stop being your friends over this without getting a full story, they weren't really good friends to begin with.", "You don't need to be willing to hold the baby.\n\nMom of four here. When people say they don't want to hold the kid, *you automatically shouldn't want them to hold your child*. People take it like a personal insult instead of a fact they need to deal with.\n\n8 mos and wrapped in a blanket? Stick that kid on the floor! Ask someone to give a shout if the baby fusses or gets mobile. Way safer than handing the child to someone who isn't comfortable handling the situation.\n\nAbsolutely NTA.", "How is that an instinct? It's a baby, not a hot pan.", "No one said you have to do it, in fact I and many other people explicitly said that you don\u2019t have to hold to babies. Why are you arguing with a point that isn\u2019t being made?", "OP said \"Instinctively (like when being handed something you don't want) my arms shot up\". Elsewhere he said it was a \"failed handoff\", and that's probably a better description.", "[deleted]", "A lot of people are trying to argue I need to, or that I should just suck it up because, like you said, \"it is just fine for a few minutes.\"\n\nThe point is being made.\n\n(deleted my last comment because I got confused and thought you were the other commenter. The sentiment stands though)", "That\u2019s not my comment, bud.", "Again, I didn\u2019t say that you should hold the baby. I responded solely to your claim that there\u2019s a \u201cproper way to hold a baby\u201d that you don\u2019t \u201cknow.\u201d Have you used reddit before? More than one user can and typically does participate in a thread. \n\nYTA based on your attitude here. If you\u2019re arguing that you don\u2019t need to hold a baby with people who explicitly agree that you don\u2019t need to hold a baby, you\u2019re probably just a jerk about it.", "\"I don't like your reasoning for not wanting to hold a baby so I'm going to write a passive-aggressive comment about it and then call you TA when you respond in kind\"\n\nOkay. Thanks for the judgment.", "You literally said it should be \u201cfine for a few minutes\u201d. \n\nEither you think OP should hold the baby or not, which is it? You\u2019re not being very clear.", "I do not think OP needs to hold any baby. \n\nThere isn\u2019t a \u201cproper way to hold a baby\u201d in the context of a few minutes - if you\u2019re not suffocating it or dangling it from a limb, literally however you hold a baby for a few minutes is fine (as in, entirely acceptable). \n\nPerhaps the same statements in another context will help clarify. You do not need to stretch before you go for a walk. It is fine if you stretch before going for a walk. Hopefully you understand that I\u2019m not telling you, in the two previous sentences, that you *need* to stretch before going for a walk. \n\nOP does not need to hold a baby. It is fine to hold a baby in most physical positions for a few minutes. These are not in any way contradictory statements."]}
