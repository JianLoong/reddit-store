{"id": 2388, "submission_id": "yw04zu", "title": "AITA for dropping/ making a friend drop her baby?", "selftext": "Throwaway because this is kind of a big deal.\n\nA friend of mine who I've known for a few years somewhat recently had a baby. I was there a few months back when he was first born to help with some household things and just to hang out with her, but I hadn't seen her for a couple months because she was so busy.\n\nThe last time we hung out, she asked me if I wanted to hold her son. I said no thank you. It's not that I don't like kids or anything like that, it's just holding a baby makes me incredibly uncomfortable. On top of having a phobia of vomit, it's a huge responsibility that I just don't want.\n\nHer son is about 8 months old now. I was visiting for her husband's birthday party and was glad to be able to catch up. We were having a conversation and she was holding her son when there was a loud bang from the kitchen. Someone had knocked over a pot full of food, but no one was hurt.\n\nMy friend went to go help. She started to hand me her baby and I reminded her that I'm not comfortable with that. It all happened so fast. I started saying \"Oh, no, I'm not...\" and she essentially shoved her son against my chest. Instinctively (like when being handed something you don't want) my arms shot up. My friend let go. The baby fell.\n\nHe was fine, thank god. He was wrapped in a heavy blanket since it's cold outside. But he cried. My friend absolutely lost it, and blamed me for dropping her baby. I didn't say anything at the time because I was just so shocked at what just happened. I just stood there and stuttered while she screamed and rocked him, and a crowd of other party guests formed. All I could keep saying was \"I didn't drop him!\" \"I wasn't ready!\". I ran out of the party and went home.\n\nI feel absolutely awful for the situation, but in hindsight, I don't think I should blame myself. My friend let go of her baby before making sure he was secure. She's the one who dropped him. She's messaged me since, screaming about how her son is going to be brain damaged because of me, and I haven't responded yet. I don't know how to respond, since I don't really know if I'm at fault here.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n\\-----------\n\nETA: I'm doing my best to respond to comments, but I have to get back to work. I'll put a couple of answers to common questions I've gotten here:\n\n\\- Letting the baby drop wasn't intentional. It happened too fast for me to react from arms up to be able to catch him after she let go.\n\n\\- There was no emergency with the food being spilled, we knew no one was hurt. We could see into the kitchen so we knew it was just some spaghetti in a pot that had gotten knocked over.\n\n\\- Arms up was instinctive. Kind of like saying \"no thanks\" with my hands.\n\n\\- As far as I know they haven't taken him to a doctor. A mutual friend told me he stopped crying after they stopped screaming.\n\n\\- I'm not asking if I'm TA for not wanting to hold the baby. I don't think I should be required to hold someone's baby if it makes me uncomfortable; though I would do it in a true emergency.", "created_utc": 1668525671, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yw04zu/aita_for_dropping_making_a_friend_drop_her_baby/", "score": 607, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was. Then she was no longer holding it. *She* dropped the baby, and is super embarrassed about it. The rage expressed is projection.\n\nJust handing off something, whatever it might be, to someone you know is uncomfortable with the idea of holding it, is irresponsible. How irresponsible scales with the value of the thing. I assume she places infinite value on her child, making it infinitely irresponsible to just sort of hand the baby off like it's a relay stick.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It sounds like there were plenty of other people around who could have either helped with the emergency or held the baby. People need to stop assuming women will happily take care of children.", "NTA.\n\nEven if someone is willing to hold a baby, the person handing it over needs to be sure it is secure. There were other people in the kitchen, your friend didn't need to rush in there like it was an emergency.\n\nI get that she's shook up because baby fell, that's scary. But unless a doctor has told her the child is brain damaged, she is very wrong to say that, and especially to tell others it's your fault. \n\nShe feels guilty because she knows she was wrong. That's no excuse for what she's now saying about you.", "NTA, what happened here is essentially your friend launched a baby at you, and you merely failed to catch it. That's on them.", "Tell her she overstepped your boundaries. You informed her before that you are not comfortable with holding babies. Thank God little man is ok but this is not your fault. \n\nAs a mother I wouldn't push my child off on someone without asking. It's not like the house was on fire or something. She could have carried him with her. \n\nPlease don't blame yourself. It was a miscommunication that resulted in the baby falling. He is ok which is a good thing. Your friend is in shock that her child was harmed in the process of her just dropping her kid on someone that she knows is uncomfortable holding babies.

Not even \u201cjust for a few minutes\u201d. It\u2019s ridiculous that people are trying to say youre TA, not for the baby being dropped, but because you have a personal preference of not being comfortable holding babies. What?? \n\nEven if you didn\u2019t have a vomit phobia or didn\u2019t mind the responsibility, you\u2019re allowed to just not want to hold someone\u2019s child. \n\nRegardless, someone needs to ASK YOU before handing the baby off.

This is all on her.", "NTA, what kind of dunce basically tosses their baby at someone (who it seems has never even held a baby before?) to go check on a spill?? Either she's actually a complete idiot, or she's masking her own feelings of guilt and shame for acting like a complete idiot. \n\nBut yeah, I wouldn't expect the friendship to survive this. If for no other reason than, she will probably never let it go. \n\nAny neurological issue this kid develops in the future, she'll probably blame you for. Parents always try to find a reason or explanation for health issues that are beyond their control because they need to make sense of the world - which is fine, that's a very human thing to do. But based on how this person reacted to this, don't be shocked if you're blamed for little Timmy struggling in Math class in 10 years, or you get an angry call when little Jessica is diagnosed with a seizure disorder.", "NTA. It is the job of the person handing the baby off to ensure the baby is secure before removing their hands. And spilled food isn't an emergency.

It's a paradigm assault for her to recognize that she dropped her own baby and she might never see that. You might need to accept that this friendship will never recover. I would only ever say to her- I'm sorry, I didn't drop him, I wasn't ready. As you have already and leave it at that.  If she tries to paint you as evil to the world, then you will have to defend yourself. I would only say to those people. I understand why she would say that and it's all very awful, but I didn't drop him, I wasn't ready. She suddenly and unexpectedly pressed him to me and stepped off before I had him secured. I understand perfectly how traumatizing this was for her and the child- and for me too, I was there- but it is wrong and unfair to hang this on me and call me out for it. I hope she can find peace.", "ESH. She shouldn't have given the baby to someone who has obviously never held him before, but, damn, you dropped that baby.", "NAH. Revised to NTA.

It's fine to feel guilty, you were a part of the situation. But as you said she dropped him, because she didn't make sure he was secured. I would reply with when you hand someone important, you make sure they have a hold of it before you fork off. Don't contact me again unless it's an apology. But maybe you are nicer than me.", "NTA \n\nI feel like there are a few core tenets that every parent needs to live by. Feed your baby, make sure they're clean and dry, and don't drop them on the ground. \n\nYou're not responsible for that baby's safety in any way unless you previously offer to be. If you'd asked to hold the baby I'd say everyone sucks but you had no interest in doing so. \n\nI tell every friend I have that I don't want to hold their babies. They all respect that even if they have questions why. Your friend should have asked and not basically thrown the baby at you.", "ESH sorry but if you\u2019re an adult with a friend that has a baby you NEED to get over your aversion to holding a child. The kid is 8 months old, not two weeks old, apart from dropping them there isn\u2019t much you can do to accidentally hurt the kid. I would be so sad if I had a child and my close friend refused to even hold them for a second while I need to run out of the room. \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have pushed the kid on you, and she should have reacted better, but come on bro. You can\u2019t hold your friends baby for long enough to set them down? The kid would be in your hands for like a few seconds just find a place to put them. What happens when there\u2019s an emergency and now she knows she can\u2019t count on you? You can\u2019t be surprised if she doesn\u2019t want to be friends with someone she can\u2019t trust around her kid. You\u2019re entitled to never hold a baby, but expecting your friends that are parents to be chill with that is unreasonable in my opinion.", "Light Y.T.A because it seems like your actions were mostly out of instinct, but you don't seem to acknowledge that what you did was wrong.\n\nNormally I'd say your friend was in the wrong for giving you the baby when she knows you don't like to hold them, but she was likely panicking and worried that this was an emergency situation. Was she even aware that \"nobody was hurt\" at that point? She jumped in to help and made sure her hands were free by handing her baby to an adult she trusted, which is reasonable. Most people instinctually grab things that they're handed. She was trying to make sure everyone was safe and okay. What were you trying to do?\n\nEven if you \"don't like\" holding babies, it was more important for you to make sure the baby WASN\u2019T DROPPED. It would have taken you about 5 seconds to either gently put the baby down or to hand them to someone else. This was a moment of panic, and the baby's safety was more important than your general distaste for holding them. It's unclear to me how intentional your actions were, or if you would have taken the baby if you'd had a moment more to think about it.\n\nEDIT: Amending to NAH since at that point it was clear it wasn't an emergency situation, and OP acted on instinct rather than principle.", "ESH.\n\nCan't hold a baby for a few minutes? Really? Or take him and, I don't know, hand him to another guest literally 10 seconds later?\n\nMom is also to blame for not making sure you were actually holding the baby before letting go.", "I have such a different instinct than you that I'm not sure how to answer this one.  If someone shoves a baby at me - crying, vomiting, snotting, drooling - no matter what they're doing, unless I'm wearing a silk dress and scheduled to appear publicly in 10 minutes, I take the baby and hold them securely.  If I'm wearing silk, I just face the sticky parts outward while holding securely and find better arms than mine to hold them.  But generally, clothing washes or dry cleans and baby drool isn't toxic.\n\nI mean these questions kindly, and ask in a spirit of finding information and not trying to poke fun/be mean: are you autistic?  Do you have zero experience with infants?  Is your vomit phobia so strong that even infants/people who haven't/aren't vomiting freak you out?\n\nSoft ESH.  You don't hand over a baby unless you know someone is ready to take it.  On the other hand, babies aren't radioactive dirty bombs.  They're just babies.  You will no doubt be confronted with other babies as your friends have more; might as well get used to them.\n\nHere's a hint or two:  unless a baby has recently eaten and you are burping it, the chances of a baby spitting up (they don't really vomit) are pretty slim.  Also, don't jump up and down, and the baby's stomach will stay where it should.  You can hold a baby by putting its back against your chest, one arm underneath its legs/butt, and the other arm around its chest.  This is best with an older child because they can hold their heads up in this position.  Newborns really have to be either supported on your shoulder or cradled.  You can always ask for a cloth diaper or burp cloth to put over your shoulder if you're really worried about spit up.\n\nThe baby is probably not brain-damaged.  You'll probably not get asked to hold many more babies.  But if you are, just grab it and hold it securely.  It won't hurt you.  You won't hurt it.  They're pretty sturdy, and most of them think new people are interesting.", "ESH. You for not stepping up and sucking it up and her for forcing it on you. You dropped a baby dude. You could have caught him and passed him to someone else. She was in a rush and probably stressed, she was not thinking straight. If she was, she would have given him to someone else.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I am also (and you might find this surprising, but this is actually VERY COMMON in MANY autistic people) so extremely, naturally maternal in my instincts that many of my mom friends literally come to me for advice because their babies and young children gravitate to me. This is been a lifelong thing for me. I'm like a Disney princess with small animals, but with little kids and babies. Many autistic people actually form strong bonds with small kids because we tend not to put up facades and little children find our natural openness appealing and comforting. Many of us also have a strong \"protective instinct\" because of having been bullied and tend to want to protect other vulnerable people...like babies. \n\nBut also, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, autistic people vary as much as non-autistic people in what we like and don't like, what our strengths and weaknesses are. While some of us may be uncomfortable with babies, it is no more likely than amongst the rest of the population. \"Maternal/paternal instinct\" or the ability to care for or connect with an infant has LITERALLY NOTHING TO DO with the diagnostic criteria for autism or anything related to how our brains work.\n\nPlease stop perpetuating harmful stereotypes about autistic people by asking anyone who seems cold/nervous/anxious around other people, or children, or whatever \"are you autistic\"? There are a million reasons for these things, and autism is rarely the likely one.", "I'm not autistic. \n\nI don't care about drool, stickiness, etc. I do have an actual phobia of vomit, but even that isn't the reason I don't want to hold babies.

I don't want to be responsible should someone knock into me and the baby is hurt, or should I fumble and drop them (ironic, I know). \n\nI don't think they're radioactive dirty bombs nor did I ever say that, I just really am not comfortable holding a baby.

I didn't mean to imply that people who are autistic are weird; I don't think people who are autistic are any more weird than people who are not autistic.  People in general are weird, and I don't exclude myself.\n\nHere is the explanation I should have given:  I have a friend who is autistic.  One of the things she associates with her autism is a dislike for fluids like drool.  They're sticky and thick and she can't stand touching them.  Babies extrude weird substances on a regular basis.  If a baby is in the teething stage, when they're most likely to drool, she doesn't want anything to do with them.

Having a baby thrust at you when you weren't ready or willing to hold the baby and you reacting as though someone was handing you something dangerous that would hurt you (is that better than radioactive dirty bomb?) is what makes me say the situation is a soft everyone sucks here.  A pot falling wasn't such an emergency that she had to dump the baby on the nearest person with arms.  A baby isn't such a delicate or dangerous thing that you had to react by jumping back so it didn't touch you.  You might want to ask someone to show you how to hold a baby (though there's really no wrong way as long as you support the head of a newborn) so you know in case there's a real emergency, like a pot of boiling water fell and there were serious burns and she really DID need to hand off the baby and help deal with things.\n\nYou can politely decline to hold every single baby offered to you; I agree that part doesn't make you TA.", "Not what I said.  I said it's a soft everyone sucks (so no one reaches TA level) because the mom didn't really need to hand off the baby on an emergency basis; it doesn't sound like anyone was hurt.  The OP threw up his hands and leapt away from the baby rather than just grabbing it and then finding someone else to take it.", "No.  I thought mild autism might be a possibility because babies secrete all kinds of bodily fluids (even ignoring products of digestion) and I have a mildly autistic friend who really hates things with those textures.

OP lifting their arms as a \"natural reaction\" defies the thought here that in the suddenness of a real emergency, she would have grabbed the baby. Either OP is miscalculating their capacity in such a situation, or the arm raising wasn't as natural as they've said here. I think the situation is misrepresented and OP purposefully didn't grab the baby, but wasn't expecting Mom to drop the baby without being sure it was securely held. \n\nBecause OP purposefully didn't grab the baby when Mom was in a rush, I do think there's a little responsibility on her side.\n\nI completely think Mom shoulders far more responsibility and irresponsibly let go of their baby.

I'm sorry I didn't take your baby, and I really hope they're fine. But please understand, I didn't *drop* your baby because I never *held* your baby.\" Apologies cost little and I'm always appalled by Redditors who freak out at the notion of apologizing to people we care about.\n\nThat all said, from Mom's continued responses, watch your back OP.

I do think it's dramatic when people don't just suck up what should be mild discomfort in order to be part of a team. Like I prefer people who let logic win.   And, you have the right to be very dramatic. Being dramatic or illogical doesn't make you an asshole. It's up to you to determine whether you want to be those things, but you're not an asshole. No one should ever force you to hold a baby. But I do think that choosing to learn how to hold one is a responsible thing to do as an adult who is choosing to be around babies.

I have been lucky and have not used any on mine.", "Dad of one checking in with complete agreement.", "I don't think people know what an \"instinct\" is. Like, if anything, I would think the human instinct would be to protect young from obvious immediate harm. Not sure how watching an offspring of your species plummet to the ground is evolutionarily advantageous.", "You instinctually react like that whenever someone hands you something ? I don't believe you.", "You are reading too much into my statement. \n\n- whether OP has to hold a baby\n\n- whether there is a proper (as in, all other ways are wrong) way to hold a baby for a few minutes \n\nI addressed the latter, after clearly stating OP need not hold the baby. \n\nBy the way, no one needs to provide a reason to decline to hold a baby - and simply not wanting to is a sufficient reason on its own.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Mom of two and you are both right.", "That\u2019s exactly how people reacts when they\u2019re handed something they always say NO to. \n\nShe had made clear she wasn\u2019t comfortable handling something or (in this case) babies, so mom should have never pass the baby to her and just let go, that was incredible irresponsible of her.", "When someone hands me something *I don't want.*\n\nBut okay, then don't believe me.", "Yeah people generally calmly pass a baby to some willing person, fully supporting their head and neck through the transition.\n\nLike, the mother was letting the baby get air-time. That's not ok.", "When someone just finished explaining that they will not hold your baby, them raising their arms to avoid said baby as you attempt to foist it upon them is probably your own fault", "Ummm... You seem to have misread what I originally wrote (either due to reading comprehension or intent), because it was not geared towards talking to the mother. It was geared towards mutuals and explaining OPs side of what happened. \n\nSo.... I'm not gonna waste time reading all of that. I can safely assume it's irrelevant or just stupid.", ">The way you do that is accept your share of the blame, acknowledge where your fault lies and do better\n\nOP said he didn't want the baby, then she pushed it against his chest and let go before waiting for him to grab it...", "I don't, and neither will your (former) friend group. If you actually care about saving any of those relationships, think up a better excuse.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Hard to think up a better excuse than the truth."]}
