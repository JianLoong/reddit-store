He was just always down to earth and didn\u2019t act like a rich asshole, and he did also put some effort into keeping his finances low key because he\u2019d had trouble with gold diggers in the past. Anyways, when I told my family about the money I\u2019d be marrying into, they were a little weirded out, but by that point they already loved Doug and treated him like their own child (which was also really good for Doug, since both his parents died when he was young). Most importantly, they wanted me to be happy and secure in life, so they accepted it all. \n\nMy sister (39f), Renee flipped out though, ranting about how I was just a gold digger and how I was ashamed of our family for having to actually work for a living. She made a nuisance of herself at the wedding, getting drunk and then telling everyone that Doug must not actually like me that much because he \u2018cheaped out\u2019, when in reality me and Doug both agreed on having a small ceremony with mostly just close friends and family, and it was still really beautiful and admittedly costly. She said our marriage would never last because Doug would dump me as soon as he got bored of \u2018charity work\u2019. \n\nCut to eleven years later, I\u2019m still happily married and have two beautiful daughters. Doug is SAHD while I work by choice because I enjoy my job. Recently, Renee\u2019s husband, who is in the same field as me, lost his job and has essentially gotten himself blacklisted everywhere in our field. Renee came by uninvited to basically beg me to get my BIL a job at my company. I told her I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with that, since it would be putting the company, as well as my own professional reputation, on the line. I offered to give them enough money to keep them afloat until they figured out something else, but Renee said she doesn\u2019t need my \u2018blood money\u2019, and that I have no idea how hard it is to be in their position, which is ridiculous considering I started working when I was like fourteen or fifteen just to help my parents with their bills. \n\nSo I got a little petty and told my sister that it sounded like she was just trying to take the easy way and not putting in the work and just wanted to benefit from family connections and a lot of other similar stuff like what she\u2019s said to me in the past. She called me a selfish a-hole and said that if her family ends up losing their house then it\u2019s my fault for not just giving her BIL a chance when I\u2019d still be okay even if I lost my job or the entire company went under.

It\u2019s a rare find on Reddit.", "NTA not by a longshot. For a person to be blacklisted in an industry they have to have done something pretty egregious like embezzlement, sharing privileged information, violating client privacy, etc. If your BIL was blacklisted it would do your career and family no favors by recommending him for a job. Your sister has a problem tinged in jealousy that you're in a better position financially yet wants to be able to use that position to her benefit. It doesn't work that way. You offered her other solutions and she chose not to take them.", "You're definitely not the asshole. Your sister, if the other hand, sounds like an angry, entitled AH. Why did she call your money \"blood money\"? Does she know what blood money is?", "NTA There is a reason why BIL is blacklisted, you do not want to put your professional reputation on the line. On top of that, the things your sister has said about you and your marriage to your husband are not forgivable in my opinion. She wants to talk trash about your family and then ask for help? The audacity. I wouldn\u2019t even give them money to keep them afloat, because you will be met with contempt for doing so still.\n\nEdit: misnamed BIL", "NTA\n\nIf she was willing to straight out call your money offer \"blood money\" as if suggesting that your money was earned through criminal ways and after straight out say that you still would be okay after you lose your job and the entire company goes under, because you still would have your \"blood money\".\n\nIt's obvious that since your marriage are still going true despite your sister \"predicting\" that you would have failed to keep it together, that she hoped that you would be fired from your job after you \"recruited\" your BIL a job in your place.\n\nIf your BIL have been black-listed from most of the the area of your work field then it must have happened for a reason and even if you \"tried\" the company would have looked him up first if they are a big serious company and realized that he was black-list marked from most of your field of work and denied him anyway even with your \"recommendation\".\n\nso once again NTA, but your sister is surely an AH for most likely try to ruin your work career!\n\nEdit: if your sister started straight away to call you a gold digger, makes me wonder if she was jealous that you got a rich husband and there for she was the \"real\" gold digger in the end.", "NTA\nIf you do not think he would be good for the job do not recommend him.\nHe may be in the wrong field.", "NTA - If BIL has been blacklisted everywhere, he's screwed up something fierce.  Not worth the risk, and it's not like you didn't offer to help.  A shame that your sister has become blinded by your Mother's attitudes though.", "INFO: What did he do to get blacklisted in the industry?  That usually takes some pretty serious bad conduct\u2026", "NTA - Your sister has decided you are evil incarnate - and made her opinions known time and again. \nWhen she needs help she comes to you - and demands you help her only in the way she wants - which would put your job at risk - because you'd be vetting a guy who admittedly is likely problematic (Why is he blacklisted? Probably there's a good reason).\nYou offered a perfectly good alternative - helping them out financially until he could find other employment and she refused that?  \nYour sister is a piece of work.\nShe also attempted to ruin your wedding which I'm not sure I'd have found forgivable unless she was a teenager at the time. (She could have just not attended if she was that offended).\nShe sounds a bit narcissistic - or something? lol  Sorry it's probably just she's a bit of work huh?  \nHang in there - offer the money again if there's a suitable time - maybe thru another family member if you can.  Maybe with an agreement to pay it back if that makes it more palatable to her? Or as a one-time gift or investment in her future? But do not feel you did anything wrong by not finding that dude a job.  Sounds like he created problems for himself and needs to recognize that.", "NTA her husband is mediocre if not worse and she deeply envies you.", "NTA\n\nHe is a grown man and is capable of getting his own job. Maybe if he hadn't gotten himself blacklisted everywhere and your sister wasn't so nasty at your wedding, then I could possibly see helping.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is probably regretting marrying the bloke she did because he's getting nowhere and she's an entitled brat.\n\nHow in the world can she justify even asking you for help knowing that he's been blacklisted everywhere?  No way would I recommend him for anywhere.", "NTA. Sorry OP but your sister sounds like she has reverse snobbery. She thinks that only decent people suffer and toil hard and everyone else is unworthy. She acted like an asshole at your wedding and now she\u2019s being a hypocrite.", "NTA  \nKeep your sister away from your kids. She is toxic and bitter. To get fired/blacklisted like your BIL did he must have really messed up, don't risk your career for him. \n\nYou made your sister a generous offer to help, if she says another spiteful thing it's time to think about going LC.", "NTA. If he has been blacklisted that says a lot! Also your sister sounds like she has a massive chip on her shoulder and needs to get over the money issue.", "NTA, she is just jealous, and wants you to lose something for her own satisfaction.", "He was blacklisted in his field due to his own actions. There's nothing you can do to help either of them. \n\nPeople in need can also be entitled. \n\nNtA", "Nope. NTA.\n\nLook I have no idea what BIL did, but he got himself blacklisted from an ENTIRE INDUSTRY. That rarely happens without good reason. You're right not to back him up. This is their mess to sort out and you are not responsible for their financial welfare. You have also offered them interim financial assistance so you can't even be accused of indifference.", "NTA. Nepotism is not a good thing and the fact he's blacklisted says a lot. If he was anything else than amazing at whatever job you managed to get him, all your colleagues would be talking behind your back about how he's a sympathy hire or that he only got the job because of you, which would build up resentment in the team.\n\nOut of interest, why did you start off by telling your \"family about the money I\u2019d be marrying into\"? Saying he's financially comfortable/secure is fine. The way you've written this sounds more like you were bragging...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're right to believe your reputation was on the line and to not get involved. \n\nThere is also the nepotism aspect of things such that people would resent you for getting him in when other candidates in the field may have been more qualified, yet overlooked.

You're not responsible for your BIL and you did offer financial assistance until things were sorted out. \n\nIf he was blacklisted to the point that he couldn't get a job in his field, he could have gone back to school and picked up a different trade.
