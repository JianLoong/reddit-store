My sister has never been shy about using it/asking for it as far as I know. Her wedding cost around $80k, she got a nose job costing $10k, a new car costing around $60k. Bridal shower $8k. Down payment for house, idk how much that was. She tried to take over the family business (where I was excluded completely) but it didn\u2019t work out. She also doesn\u2019t work at all and hasn\u2019t for a couple years. She is a hard worker when she does work Also my parents gave her a $300k empty property.\n\nI never ask my parents for literally anything, although of course I have never gone without - school paid for, car for myself , etc. they give me money sometimes to \u201ceven it out.\u201d I work two jobs. I have been given a lot tbh but not nearly the amount she has, although they are working on it.\n\nBrings me to the issue. My sister is pregnant and holding a baby shower. I found a nice way to do it how I would personally want it (less expensive, homey, cozy) etc. someone got involved with planning and somehow the event ended up at an expensive steakhouse for 60 people and I\u2019m splitting the cost with someone else. My parents are not paying for it for a couple different reasons.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s not costing as much as I thought, im fed up at my sisters attitude and blew up at her. Of course im paying for something she will benefit from and it will be the most expensive thing possible. We got into a fight and I brought up all of this stuff. She pointed out all the ways I benefit like living rent free at my parents for now, which she always had the option to. I feel like TA for blowing up at my pregnant little sister and viewing money this way when I should be celebrating this milestone. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr- got into a fight with my sister about her spending and her idea for an event.", "created_utc": 1686751056, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1498l3e/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_pregnant_sister/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
