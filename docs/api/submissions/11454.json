Why does he need control of the remote? And why was he so upset you looked in his drawer? D this the only thing he likes to control?", "NTA. He's being ridiculous and his behaviour suggests he's being dishonest.\n\n It's okay to want and expect privacy...But if he had nothing to hide..and the only reason you opened his drawer was to retrieve a tv remote - normal people understand this and would  be like ...'my bad for putting  the remote there' - they wouldnt blame you. \n\n'But my privacy' , nah that was void the second he put the tv remote in the drawer. \n\nMakes me wonder what he's trying to hide from you OP.", "NTA.\nBut your partner is. Dollars to donuts he knew it was in there.  The only real issue is whether it's a jerk power play or an immature avoidance of being found to be in the wrong.\n\nEither way, don't accept any of his fuming as being in any way your fault.", "NTA.\nSimple ! Don\u2019t put the remote in your drawer and I won\u2019t open it \ud83e\udd23.", "NTA. You gave him multiple opportunities to search for it himself. Why did he never bother to look? That\u2019s what baffles me. I\u2019d search everywhere until I found the remote.", "Nope. NTA.   \n\n\nThere is a reasonable expectation of privacy in a relationship. But it doesn't extend to, you can never go here. It's like, you WBTAH if you were searching for signs of infidelity. Or if you regularly went through his stuff to check up on him. That would be controlling and weird. What you did was look in his drawer for a common item. You found it and then stopped. That's normal behavior.   \n\n\nHe's an a$$ for not looking in his drawers when he said he would look. That's all on him.   \n\n\nSo, now I'm starting to think this guy does have something to hide. His behavior is weird. Dresser drawers aren't so sacred that another person would never go there. Heck, the other day, I opened my partner's drawer because I was just curious. She's sloppy and I was wondering if anything was actually ever put away. I opened it, confirmed that indeed, there's little in there and it's not organized at all, and closed the drawer. I have no problem with her knowing this and she would not be offended. It's not really my business so I didn't bug her about her mess.   \n\n\nThe fact that he's \"fuming?\" I mean, why???? What's going on in this relationship?", "NTA, if he wants people to not go in his drawers then he shouldn\u2019t put other peoples or joint property in them period. His fault and ridiculous that he would not even check in there for months. Nothing wrong with not going into them as long as the contents are his only.", "NTA, but also, he knew the whole time.  This was done with a level of intent.", "NTA but sometimes a little white lie to avoid confrontation is OK.  You coulda told him it was under the bed or something.  I have a couple drawers that are mine that I don't want people going through, like my desk drawer that I keep all my medical MJ stuff in.  It's in a locked case in the drawer so I wouldn't be terribly upset someone did go in there, but I'd rather they didn't", "NTA\n\nWhy in the world would your partner **care** if you looked in a drawer to find a remote?  That you had been looking for for **months**.\n\nHe's being weirdly territorial over a drawer with a partner he lives with.  I'd wonder **why** he's acting that way.   \n\nSaying \"it's my drawer\" **is no justification for his behavior**.   It comes across to me as a control issue or power play.\n\nHe's being a total AH here.", "NTA. Invest in a key finder for the remote.", "NTA, something is very wrong here. Is this the only time partner has made you feel less than and uncomfortable about something normal?", "NTA. Even if he was convinced the remote wasn't in there he should have checked at least once. The sheer number of times things can be found in a place you are certain they were not put requires a check.", "NTA. Why are his drawers forbidden territory? I'd wonder what else he is hiding in there...", "NTA and this is very weird. Why is he so intense about the drawer? It\u2019s been MONTHS and you just now looked there? Would you get in trouble for daring to open a drawer in your own room? Why does he get to get away with that for months\u2026?", "NTA\n\nHe knew it was in there and ignored you every time. \n\nLeave this AH", "NTA. You found the remote, didn't you?", "This is going to be unpopular, but ESH\n\nPartner for not checking his drawer and for lying about checking his drawer.\n\nOP for violating his trust and checking the drawer.\n\nTo those who wonder why he doesn\u2019t want anyone looking in his drawers\u2014it is his nightstand. I keep my journal in my nightstand and I\u2019ll bet other people keep private stuff there, too.\n\nI\u2019d be mad as hell if my partner was digging around in a place that I had told them was off limits.\n\nOf course, I would also have checked the damn drawer for the remote ages ago.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He used your consistent respect for his privacy to invalidate and maintain your discomfort and frustration because HE hid the remote.

You said it's what I call a junk drawer - it's the place he puts things when he doesn't want to put them away in a real place yet.
