Why does he need control of the remote? And why was he so upset you looked in his drawer? D this the only thing he likes to control?", "NTA. He's being ridiculous and his behaviour suggests he's being dishonest.\n\n It's okay to want and expect privacy...But if he had nothing to hide..and the only reason you opened his drawer was to retrieve a tv remote - normal people understand this and would  be like ...'my bad for putting  the remote there' - they wouldnt blame you. \n\n'But my privacy' , nah that was void the second he put the tv remote in the drawer. \n\nMakes me wonder what he's trying to hide from you OP.", "NTA.\nBut your partner is. Dollars to donuts he knew it was in there.  The only real issue is whether it's a jerk power play or an immature avoidance of being found to be in the wrong.\n\nEither way, don't accept any of his fuming as being in any way your fault.", "NTA.\nSimple ! Don\u2019t put the remote in your drawer and I won\u2019t open it \ud83e\udd23.", "NTA. You gave him multiple opportunities to search for it himself. Why did he never bother to look? That\u2019s what baffles me. I\u2019d search everywhere until I found the remote.", "Nope. NTA.   \n\n\nThere is a reasonable expectation of privacy in a relationship. But it doesn't extend to, you can never go here. It's like, you WBTAH if you were searching for signs of infidelity. Or if you regularly went through his stuff to check up on him. That would be controlling and weird. What you did was look in his drawer for a common item. You found it and then stopped. That's normal behavior.   \n\n\nHe's an a$$ for not looking in his drawers when he said he would look. That's all on him.   \n\n\nSo, now I'm starting to think this guy does have something to hide. His behavior is weird. Dresser drawers aren't so sacred that another person would never go there. Heck, the other day, I opened my partner's drawer because I was just curious. She's sloppy and I was wondering if anything was actually ever put away. I opened it, confirmed that indeed, there's little in there and it's not organized at all, and closed the drawer. I have no problem with her knowing this and she would not be offended. It's not really my business so I didn't bug her about her mess.   \n\n\nThe fact that he's \"fuming?\" I mean, why???? What's going on in this relationship?", "NTA, if he wants people to not go in his drawers then he shouldn\u2019t put other peoples or joint property in them period. His fault and ridiculous that he would not even check in there for months. Nothing wrong with not going into them as long as the contents are his only.", "NTA, but also, he knew the whole time.  This was done with a level of intent.", "NTA but sometimes a little white lie to avoid confrontation is OK.  You coulda told him it was under the bed or something.

It comes across to me as a control issue or power play.\n\nHe's being a total AH here.", "NTA. Invest in a key finder for the remote.", "NTA, something is very wrong here. Is this the only time partner has made you feel less than and uncomfortable about something normal?", "NTA. Even if he was convinced the remote wasn't in there he should have checked at least once. The sheer number of times things can be found in a place you are certain they were not put requires a check.", "NTA. Why are his drawers forbidden territory? I'd wonder what else he is hiding in there...", "NTA and this is very weird. Why is he so intense about the drawer? It\u2019s been MONTHS and you just now looked there?

Why does he get to get away with that for months\u2026?", "NTA\n\nHe knew it was in there and ignored you every time. \n\nLeave this AH", "NTA. You found the remote, didn't you?", "This is going to be unpopular, but ESH\n\nPartner for not checking his drawer and for lying about checking his drawer.\n\nOP for violating his trust and checking the drawer.\n\nTo those who wonder why he doesn\u2019t want anyone looking in his drawers\u2014it is his nightstand.

I was feeling some suspense of what he's hiding in there that's making him so keen on you not looking through it. I now want to know the contents of his drawer. He is TA since he didn't ever look in his drawer for it. I dislike lost remotes as well and they are typically under my husband's butt.", "op=NTA\n\nYou have equal right(if not more) to be Angry at him for NOT even looking after you asked how many times.\n\nHowever, a few options for the future.  1) next time LIE about where you found it 2) buy a universal remote, so you have a spare.  3) get a remote tag(they are cheap) that will give you beeping to track it(Unless you want to upgrade to the gps locator type).", "You're NTA for getting your remote back. You shouldn't make excuses for his behavior though. Yes, everyone is entitled to some degree of privacy, but nightstand drawers isn't that. And the fact that the remote was just chilling right there the entire time just goes to show that Really isn't his private stash spot. If it was, he would have known the remote was there.", "The Stockholm syndrome is strong with this one...", "NTA. He was testing you\u2026what a horrible thing for him to do !", "NTA, you just wanted to find the remote   not like you wenthrought  all his stuff you just went through  the one drawer. And you wouldn't have to look for it if he checked.", "Strange relationship but NTA", "Sweetie, please seek therapy. NTA", "NTA. If he has a private life to hide, don\u2019t put community property in the same drawer he hides crap in. Plain and simple.", "NTA he is hiding something if he doesn\u2019t want you finding a remote in his drawers. I would find out what it is.", "Your partner has serious issues if you can't look in a drawer.... maybe want to take a closer look at this guy.....", "Sometimes the remote magically appears under someone's butt. You'll stand, it won't be there, sit back down, rummage the surroundings, stand back up and it's under your butt.", "Or he did look, didn't see it, and didn't take account that it's EXTREMELY common for the thing to be there where it already looked anyway. \n\nMy mom and I can both attest to numerous situations where we asked someone (partner or child, generally) to look in a place for a thing, they say it's not there, they *swear* it's not there, and then we find it exactly there. I have occasionally had other people find things in places *I* already looked. I've even found things *myself* after already looking in that place two or three times. It's just a human thing.\n\nThis is probably the most likely situation because in my experience almost everyone is overconfident about their searching abilities. But he's still a little bit of an AH for not giving any credence to the idea that maybe he just didn't look super well, compounded by getting mad about it.", "[deleted]", "I AGREE THIS IS ABUSE. OP GET OUT RED FLAGS EVERYWHERE. REMOTIAL ABUSE AND DRAWERISM.", "That\u2019s a dangerous argument against any sort of privacy for anyone in any relationship", "Sorry but you are giving him excuses, I've been with my hubby for 12 years and if he ever acted that way about a damn drawer u would go through just to make sure he wasn't hiding that he was cheating, doing drugs or something else illegal. YWBTA if you don't get to the bottom of this when you live together.", "He lied to you for months. Why?", "He obviously knew it was in there if he got angrier each time you asked and he refused to check it. Girl run", "Whoa whoa whoa-  the guy expects a smidgin of privacy and now he\u2019s a drug addict with something to hide?  \n\nThe fact the remote control was hidden in there for months (months?!) is all sorts of problems but expecting a your cupboards to be your own is not an issue is it?", "It baffles me after months that no one bought a couple of cheap replacement remotes. \n\nThat being said, he's being a bit weird, and the fact that she described him as gas-lighty is troubling. \n\nBut, like, it's a remote. Just get a new one, and while you're at it, see if you can't get a phone app to do the job in a pinch.", "The part I find concerning is the angry reaction to being asked to check the drawer. I\u2019m the kind of person that misplaces items like this, and when I eventually find it, it\u2019s in a place I searched multiple times before. The difference is I wouldn\u2019t get mad at someone for asking me to check my drawer again. If something\u2019s missing I just keep checking places repeatedly until it shows up. \nGetting upset about that is a major red flag. As is not apologizing after it turned up in that exact location.", "Please see a therapist about this.", "Sounds like he's a control freak.", "NTA, don\u2019t be concerned about the remote\u2026why is he so defensive and secretive? How long has he been cheating? \ud83e\udd78", "NtA. And also, this guy seems shitty for so many reasons: 1) out the remote in a drawer you shouldn\u2019t check (??) b) is annoyed when you ask him to check drawers c) is angry when you double check- he\u2019s either not bothered to value your inquests or is intentionally deceitful- either way: shitty. D) mad because you revealed he was shitty", "NTA... Um, my husband won't go in my purse, I think his mom taught him that and it stuck. But there are no drawers we can't look into when we are looking for a lost item. I still wouldnt read his phone without permission, but even that's not locked and I know I am welcome to.", "Your husband sucks! The fact that you can\u2019t go in his bedside drawer sounds like there\u2019s more of an issue going on here and you don\u2019t even know it! You went months without the tv remote all because you wouldn\u2019t go in his drawer because you knew he\u2019d be mad about it! That\u2019s sad and he is controlling! NTA but your husband surely is!", "lol this is get the fuck out behaviour \n\nNTA obviously", "Does he not actually wear underwear because I can bet you, he\u2019s seen it in there after months if he does? This is ridiculous. Gaslighting is abuse. He knew exact,y where you found it when he asked. Next time say under the bed, and see how he responds.", "There is a bigger problem here.", "OP was pregnant at one point so is likely not a man", "half sarcastic, or half the mistress?", "They post and comment in the askgaybros sub and their name say James William so I'm assuming they're a man.", "\nYour bf is an AH for not looking for/hiding the remote\nYou're an AH for going into a private drawer", "I\u2019m just glad nobody got hurt", "NTA sure he doesn\u2019t like going through his stuff, weird but sure. However, you ask and asked and it\u2019s been months.", "I would be looking in that drawer again because he is acting like he has something he is hiding in there", "Get another remote. Also, NTA", "Wrong question. Is this acceptable to you? He has you conditioned to make excuses for him, so this relationship is working for him. It isn't working for you, but you can't see it. Get some therapy, you aren't the problem here.", "Our newest TV only turns on via remote. There are no buttons on the side. For whatever reason, we are ALWAYS losing that remote. Part of the problem is we have three neurodivergent kids who use the remote and absently set it down, make no memory of where they put it, and then romp around the room so it falls in cracks and crevices. We actually bought a second remote for the TV, and then my husband washed it and cracked the sensor, so we're back down to one that's probably lost more than found. If the TV is left on, we can control it from Google, but if it's off, no dice. A replacement remote was only $15 on Amazon. \n\nOP, if I were you, I'd but another remote to keep in your drawers. At best, you never have to look for the remote again. At worst, you'll find that your partner's behavior was telling more about himself than you, if you suddenly find that your remote is missing.", "I don\u2019t consider a book a place within a home. \n\nIf my husband had a diary, and asked me not to look in it, I wouldn\u2019t. Just like my husband would never go in my wallet without permission. \n\nThat said, if I lost my car keys and never looked in my purse, he would definitely check there. Just like I would go in his bedside table if I was looking for something. The fact that OP\u2019s spouse is acting the way he is, is very suspect.", "It's his personal drawers he doesn't need to be hiding anything to expect people to stay out.", ">What does he have to hide? \n\nHe doesn't necessarily have something to hide.  Why do people always go there?  It's his drawer and he may have personal, private things there that he doesn't feel comfortable sharing with anyone. \n\nPersonal space is just that - personal.  He doesn't even need to give a reason unless he feels like it since sometimes giving a reason gives away what you're trying to keep personal (not hidden).", "Eugh is she really? Just from the one above you can see she's an enabler. Narcissists love this personality.", "I just got whiplash!", "Very possible that they are trans and gay.", "If you have an open and honest relationship than you can open a drawer. Like yes privacy, and don\u2019t eat the last potato chip. But a drawer in a shared space\u2026 weird if you ask me.", "NTA. He could have just actually checked when you repeatedly asked him to. But it\u2019s weird that he\u2019s so triggered, if he doesn\u2019t have something to hide. It\u2019s a drawer, it\u2019s not like you were reading his personal diary or something? The paranoia combined with the lying and defensiveness are all red flags.", "INFO: Then why didn't he just look in his now draw instead of spending months without the proper remote?\n\nDid you not ask him?  If so why not?  If you did then why did he refuse? \n\nYes, everyone deserves privacy but from what you say it seems like it's malicious on his part to hide things from you.", "I hate to break it to you but gaslighting is a form of abuse and will make you start to question your reality.", "Okay, keep private things private, that's fine. But he knowingly had shared property in his possession for months. \ud83d\ude43 Even if he didn't know it was there, he didn't bother humoring you and checking himself. It's pretty rude.\n\nNTA btw", "Was waiting for a response to jump to something like drug addiction. Suddenly wanting privacy with your bedside drawers means you're hiding crack cocaine or something. Though his behaviour is definitely problematic.", "I definitely think the not apologizing is shitty, but I'm split on the getting mad about being repeatedly asked. It gets annoying, I get it. I think it's only a red flag because with hindsight, we know he was wrong to react that way."]}
