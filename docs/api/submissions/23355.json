She was probably mortified and scared but it sounds like you were level, supportive and kind. More men and in the world need to handle these situations like you, a father posted not too long ago about going off on his daughter for asking period related questions and being scared. \n\nNTA!!!", "NTA.  What you did was ensure Payton sees this as a normal bodily function, nothing to hide or be ashamed of. It would have been better to leave her stranded on the toilet until a woman came by? THAT'S a weird message.", "Your SIL is an AH for not teaching her daughter basic biology. Sounds like you handled the situation perfectly.", "NTA. \n\nHer mom should have already explained and prepared this to her daughter. \n\nIf Peyton had wanted to tell her mom immediately she could have. \n\nIt\u2019s not like she had a seizure or allergic reaction. I don\u2019t see why the mom feels like she needed to know immediately. \n\nThe only situation where I think a phone call would have been warranted immediately was if Peyton couldn\u2019t calm down, or if Peyton is like absurdly young.", "NTA There's so much justified criticism that men don't have a clue about periods.\n\nAnd here we have a dude who helped about as well as he could. And gets screamed at for being a pervert.\n\nWomen this is really, really not the message you want your sisters, daughters, mothers delivering to men doing the right thing.", "NTA.\n\nYou sir, did amazing. You handled the situation with grace and compassion. You kept a calm head, you helped a scared young lady with what can be a bit of a traumatizing time to make her feel comfortable and safe. You did nothing \"creepy\" or \"weird\" in the least. My own damn *father* noped out of the whole period thing when I was younger. Wouldn't acknowledge it (*\"You need... \"stuff?\" Let's go get... \"stuff'\"*), wouldn't do anything about it. If I needed products, he would drive me to the store and *hide in the truck* as little teenage me had to go in the store to get it myself.  He was always *mortified*. The fact you handled all of this for your niece shows how mature and collected you are. Your SIL flipping out shows honestly how immature SHE is. \n\nThe only thing I would comment on is that if done differently I would have told her privately when Payton was picked up the same day, not waited for Payton to tell her mom herself. The child was probably to embarrassed/scared to say anything to her mom. But that's not enough to change my score. You still handled everything exceptionally well. I wish more men were as collected as you are when it comes to womens feminine needs. It'd sure be a lot easier on us!", "NTA.\n\nWell you were in a situation where your niece needed your help and comfort, and you did your best to provide that.\n\nYou were respectful, supportive, and informative, and you didn't do anything inappropriate or creepy. You also didn't have any reason to think that your SIL would want to be contacted immediately, or that your niece would want you to tell her mother before she did.\r  \n\r  \nFor me, SIL is an asshole for screaming at you and accusing you of being inappropriate, a creep, an AH, and making your niece feel unsafe. \n\nShe was overreacting, rude, and unfair. She had no right to treat you that way, and she should be grateful that you took care of her daughter and made her feel better.", "NTA for the way you handled the situation. It sounds like it was handled nicely in the moment. I am not sure how old Payton is but it's really frightening that she wasn't educated about how the human body works that's on her mom and the school system (depending on where you live). Where you are the AH is not calling her mom that evening to let her know that she had her first period. Hopefully she gets over it.", "NTA but her mom is. Seriously you should have these convos with your children around 8 yo. Girls can start their periods as young as 8/9. Her mom should have been having regular conversations or at least having Peyton read book about puberty. Her mom should have been looking out for signs that her body was changing. This is 110% on her mom. YOU were the innocent bystander who got stuck in a situation you shouldn\u2019t be in but did amazingly well. Peyton is lucky to have you and your wife. Her mom\u2026that\u2019s a different story. She left Peyton to fend for herself.", "NTA her mum is though.\n\nMy daughter lives between two houses and from the age of 10 I gave her a little kit just incase she started. With clean knickers and pads in. I showed her how to do it all and explained what would happen. \n\nHow has her mum not said anything to her before this.", "NTA. Should you have just let her sit there crying and bleeding onto the furniture? How old is Peyton that this was so shocking to her, poor kid? I mean I get being startled by it, I sure was, but I knew what was going on when it happened.\n\nI also doubt that your niece thinks you're a creep, she's probably just a little embarrassed that her uncle had to handle \"girl stuff\". She'll get over that, especially if you pretend you have no memory of the event.", "SIL is a moron. She\u2019s turned this \u201cordinary, normal\u201d part of life into \u201csomething creepy and gross that we have to freak out about.\u201d NTA at all. You did good.", "NTA\n\nWhile I can understand wanting to be informed that your kid just started her first period, I would be happy knowing that she was with someone who had needed supplies and was able to explain to her how to use them. This is also why I think sex ed should be mandatory before puberty, that way kids aren\u2019t freaking out when their bodies change and can get needed knowledge about it.", "NTA.\n\nYou or your wife should probably have told her mother, if not immediately then at least a discreet word when she got picked up. But the lack of a timely FYI is minor at worst.\n\nWhat you did was give excellent practical, sympathetic support to your niece. That's fantastic! And that more than outweighs not mentioning it to her mother. You did good, and should be proud of yourself for how you handled it.\n\nETA: Re-reading this, it sounds like your niece didn't know that this was going to happen, or what it is, or how to deal with it. I which case your SIL should be ashamed for not having prepared her adolescent daughter for this inevitable fact of life. Possibly she is, which might be why she's lashing out at you.", "NTA. Payton's mom is the problem. It's not typical menstruation starts early in puberty, there are signs months beforehand - breast buds, hair growth, sweat changes, skin changes, body shape changes. Payton should have been informed in advance of what a period is, why it happens, how to manage it, common symptoms etc.\n\nIt wasn't your news to tell, it was Payton's and if she didn't want to tell her mom that was her right.\n\nYou were the caregiver at the time and sounds like you did a great job!", "NTA. You actually did s great job. I  can\u2019t believe kate wanted her kid to suffer until a woman came and talk to her?? What does she thinks single fathers do?? Men can know about periods to and talk about to a teen without being a creep.", "NTA, thank you for having the emotional maturity to share your knowledge of the menstrual cycle with Peyton. Your SIL is a truly screwed up individual. Wanting her child to sit bleeding without comfort until your wife got home. People like your SIL are the reason that there is negative stigma around a natural occurrence in a young woman\u2019s life.", "Nta your sis had her entire life to teach her daughter about her period.   Woild she prefer the kid sit in blood until wife came home????", "NTA. The mum wanted you to leave her bleeding on the loo until your wife got home? Um...", "Wow, you sound like a kind, empathic, knowledgeable uncle.  It was not your responsibility to tell Kate\u2026Payton has a voice and can speak about her own situations.  NTA", "NTA, if she's calling you creepy for discussing something completely natural and normal and making it into something it's not, then she's the creep IMO", "NTA you didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and the fact Payton is of an age to get periods but her mom hasn\u2019t told her anything about them is kind of weird. It sounds like your SIL is feeling guilty for not preparing her daughter and is taking it out on you", "NTA I wish every man was like you, don't let anyone steal your shine OP", "NTA, she\u2019s old enough to tell her mum herself. Your wife told the mum when she picked Payton up, but she only flipped later when she learned that you informed her niece. Bizarre", "NTA, it sounds like you handled it well. I don\u2019t think you needed to tell her mom, Payton could have/should have done that herself. I\u2019m assuming she and Kate have contact while Kate is travelling, and it\u2019s Payton\u2019s news to tell. Starting your period is super normal and I think we do women and everyone a disservice by acting like it\u2019s this OMG thing -it creates a level of weirdness that is not warranted in my opinion. Also depending on her age it\u2019s a bit surprising that she didn\u2019t know what was happening and that her mom didn\u2019t better prepare her - as someone else mentioned, you typically don\u2019t get your period before there have been lots of other indications. \n\nIt sounds to me like Payton got a bit embarrassed after the fact and/or her mom reacted in a way that made her feel like it was this embarrassing thing and like she did something wrong by getting her period when you were home. If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s on Kate and not you, but it\u2019s unfortunate all the same. Based on the info though, you handled it well and Kate is overreacting.", "NTA. While maybe you should\u2019ve given the mom a text, it seems like you handled it well. Far better than I\u2019d expect from some of my uncles, for example. \n\nWe need more men understanding women\u2019s reproductive health in general. Good on ya!", "NTA. damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. I would also have defaulted to letting the child inform their mother if it wasn't a medical issue but a more personal one.  You helped and informed your wife who could easily have this conversation with her sister. Keep being a good uncle.", "NTA. The mom is over reacting, you did the best you could in the situation. \n\nI bet it was something like this https://youtu.be/gV-aFh2ao0E", "NTA .. you did the right thing. \nBut don\u2019t expect to see your niece as often because your SIL has created drama, your niece probably had no issue with you originally but after her \u201c mom\u2019s \u201c input may now look at you differently.\nIf I were you, tell your wife that though you love your niece the accusation that you are creepy and that she doesn\u2019t want to be alone with you anymore is alarming and someday this nut job SIL may actually claim SA. So you will not keep her at your house anymore.", "Can you imagine how scarred this poor child would have been if his reaction would have been. \"Ok just stay in the bathroom until your Mom gets here she'll explain everything??!!\" \n\nYou did great OP!", "NTA. It's not like she could hold it in until your wife got home. It is sad she didn't even expect it, meaning she was coming to the age where it could happen at any time yet her mother never educated her herself. Thank you for stepping up to help your niece through it.", "NTA. She is lucky to have such a loving and supportive uncle to get her through a traumatic event. Your sister is a tool. Why did she not prepare her daughter for her period?", "sounds like you did a great job and it's very sad your sister sexualised this by calling you a creep.\n\nPeriods may happen to women (and trans men/nb people) but they are not just a women's issue. \n\nI'd be worried about Payton and what she's been told by her mother\n\nNTA at all. You're a great advert for normalising menstruation.", "NTA. You couldn't have handled this better in all honesty, you told her what you needed to in order to relieve her anxiety, made sure she was clean and comfortable and then waited for a woman's input to go in depth. I do think not telling her mum was a slight oversight but this reaction is totally unwarranted.", "NTA Only thing OP should have done differently is contacted the SIL afterwards.", "Nta. You said yourself you weren't purposefully hiding it from her, you assumed her daughter would tell her, and for some reason she didn't. Her saying you should have waited, is basically saying \"leave my daughter scared, feeling alone, confused and in pain, leave her unclean (it's not disgusting but period blood is still unhygienic like any bodily fluid) and potentially leaking on any surface she sits on because a man being nice to her is creepy\"", "NTA not handling it would be more traumatic for her", "NTA. Your sister will probably realize it too once she calms down.", "NTA. You\u2019re a great Uncle, husband wish more were like you.", "NTA\n\nYour handling of the situation was completely appropriate and she's a tween, not a small child. Communicating with her parent is very within her ability range and responsibility.", "NTA.\n\nI wish more men would be able to deal with girls, who got their first period, that well. I know some who definitely couldn't. Of course it would have been even better if your wife or her mom were there, because it's easier for a woman, who dealt with this herself, to explain those things but as they weren't there you did a pretty good job. Also I am frankly quite shocked that the poor girl wasn't even properly educated about this, I knew what might happen two years in advance.\n\nFor her mother to overreact like this is really unnecessary. What should you have done? Tell your niece to stay in the bathroom without explanation nor being able to change clothes until your wife comes back while she feels shitty and bleeds?\n\nAlso it might be, that the girl mentioned to her mom, that she feels uncomfortable going back and her mom misunderstood it as not wanting to go back because you made her uncomfortable. Bleeding on yourself sucks and for many women/girls it's a source of shame especially without proper prior education. So it could just be that she's embarrassed by what happened and thus might not want to go back to you and your wife. Though that is again not your fault, because you didn't shame her nor treated her badly or anything.", "NTA her mother is a complete asshole for not educating your niece so she didn\u2019t freak out when it happened. She\u2019s a complete asshole. And it was a normal assumption that she would let her own mother know\u2026 when she was ready", "NTA. But it seems that your sister is quiet unhinged. \nYou did a normal thing to help your niece in an umcomfortable situation.", "STRONGLY NTA!!! Your SIL on the other hand is a massive AH, that was her responsibility to teach her daughter about menstruation BEFORE it happens. She doesn't have any ground to stand on being mad, you handled that very gracefully from the sounds of it.", "NTA.\n\nYou handled it beautifully.  The only thing that would have made it \"better\" is if you had let your wife and Kate know right after you handled it, in case there was anything they wanted to say to her to cover with her. \n\nYou may have also hit on some guilt in Kate's mind, since she is gone for work so frequently.", "NTA, but I think that period in your life is now over, I would not have her again in my house unless she is accompanied by her mother, and considering her mother response, that should not be too frequent.", "NTA, shit if you were my kids' uncle, I'd be over the flipping moon that they had someone capable and willing to explain things that I clearly should have already discussed with my child, regardless of their gender.\n\nBravo, young man. Situation well handled.\n\nSIL is a major AH or has major issues that nobody knows about.", "NTA. You were a kind and loving family member who handled it to the best of his ability. I think she's overreacting out of guilt for not being there or helping her daughter be prepared for the inevitable eventuality. \n\nI think I might have texted her and given her the heads up that her daughter started her period and that you gave her some of your wife's pads to wear until her mom could take her shopping for what she needed. I don't think I would have said nothing at all about it because it's a pretty significant development for a girl, but I don't think you handled it at all wrong otherwise.", "NTA. I think what happened here is that Payton didn't want to talk to her mom about this, for whatever reason (you did say this explosion isn't out of character for the mom, so that's a hint), and mom feels: 1. Jealous that her daughter didn't want to tell her and instead you handled it, and 2. Embarrassed. \n\nThe fact that the daughter was this upset about starting her period and needed an explanation about how to use products lets us know why Payton didn't tell her mother imo.", "Nta. Sounds like you did a fantastic job. Peytons mom is a huge asshole for not making sure her daughter was emotionally and mentally prepared.", "NTA. I think part of her reaction is her own guilt at not being there for her daughter.", "NTA Her mother is for making her period out to be something weird or secret.", "NTA for helping her out by giving her supplies and explaining this is natural. \n\nI do think you or your wife should have told her mom she got her period. It sounds like there was plenty of time to do so since this is several days later. \n\nYour SIL needs to kick rocks.", "NTA for helping your niece!  It\u2019s an amazing thing you did for her and if your niece does feel uncomfortable, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s bc mom got in her ear. \n\nThe only thing you should have done differently is say \u201cso, this is something you need to let your mom know about so she can have everything you need at home. Would you like to call or text her yourself?  Would you like me to let her know?  Or would you like Aunt to give her a call?\u201d  Mom would have had a heads up that way.   You did an amazing job letting her know it was ok and not something to be ashamed about!", "NTA\n\nYou absolutely do not just let a kid wait while afraid.  You don\u2019t need to go into details, but basic care is great.  Making her wait would reinforce it\u2019s gross or uncomfortable or inappropriate for a guy to know.  It is not creepy for guys to be aware and helpful.  \n\nYour wife should have texted her sister, not you. \n\nBut seriously OP your SIL not having had the talk yet is SIL\u2019s failure.  She messed up and is taking it out on you", "Nta.  You handled it extremely well. So now sil can find somewhere to leave her daughter when she travels.  She has accused you of been a pervert.  Don't risk it.", "NTA. That sounds like projection. It sounds like you handled it as well as you could. Your niece likely felt more uncomfortable than she would with your wife or SIL, but what were you supposed to do? Leave her without the proper supplies and explanation until a woman comes home?\nI think it would have been wise to have contacted SIL, but not doing so doesn\u2019t make you an AH.", "Holy shit, no NTA. You were so compassionate to her. You made such a scary moment into something so normal and that's exactly what she needed. Good for you.\n\nI think your SIL needs some fucking therapy. How dare she isolate you from your niece whom you clearly love.", "NTA. You reassured her that men don't think she's gross when she's on her period, and have reinforced the idea that she should expect other men to understand and care. How does your SIL expect single dad's handle this kind of thing, especially when they don't have female relatives - just asking the nearest auntie at the store or from work? No. Like you said, she was clothed and clean with every interaction.", "NTA, though, you should have shot her a text letting her know.", "NTA for helping payton yourself, though i think a soft YTA for not telling her mother at the time it happened. it seems like something she'd want to know and would probably be easy enough to text her to give her a head's up. if i was kate i'd worry about what else might happen in the future i wouldn't be told about and kind of feel a loss of trust. her reaction though seems inappropriate and extreme. i agree with the other poster saying that kate is prolly lashing out for feeling guilty or upset for missing the moment and/or not preparing payton appropriately.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was your niece's first period, don't you think her mom should know and be prepared when Payton went home?", "INFO did *anyone* contact Kate at any point about this before picking Peyton up?", "So tired of these repeated \u201ca young girl got her period without her mother around so I helped out by getting her supplies and explaining what was happening, AITA?\u201d Don\u2019t you period trolls get tired of this narrative?", "NTA but you could have texted her or told her to text her mom.\nHow very kind of you to explain what was going on and helping her out while mom was away.\nClearly she is feeling insecure in her parenting (probably bc she travels and missed a milestone). I would just let it go & maybe she\u2019ll get over it.", "!updateme", "[deleted]", "no  you are to be applauded when I was a child this was a top secret event no one talked about even woman , glad to see times are changing", "NTA SIL? Huge A H", "NTA. You handled it better than most men would it sounds. Good on you man. Your sister is psycho.", "NTA you helped turn what could have been a traumatic experience for her into an educational and safe place. I wish someone was like this when I first got my period \ud83d\ude02 it was horrible lol.", "NTA. You handled a tough situation well. Why didn\u2019t your wife inform \u201cKate\u201d of the situation? If your wife thought it was going to be a bite deal, she should have reached out to let her know about the situation.", "It sounds like she was more upset that she was not there when Payton got her period for the first time. Some moms want to do something special for their daughter when it happens. \nYou handled it great and showed her how a guy should be when a female gets their cycle. Definitely NTA", "NTA \n\nYour SIL is though for not preparing her daughter", "NTA for handling but mom should\u2019ve know when it happened", "NTA but you probably should have let her know sometime that day.\n\nI appreciate that you handled this in a loving way with your niece.  So many men are just freaked out or grossed out about periods that it is unreal.  You handled it like a pro and I'm sure Payton is grateful.", "NTA you did great in an awkward situation. SIL should be grateful to you.", "NTA and I think you set a beautiful standard for her about how men should react to her period. You were helpful, kind, informative, non-judgmental, and just matter-of-fact about the whole thing. You gave practical advice and were also comforting. You didn't act grossed out or embarrassed for her or uncomfortable. If you had reacted with squeamishness, awkwardness, disgust, etc. by basically just throwing your hands up and telling her to call her mom, you would have reinforced the idea that her period is something shameful that men can't hear about or be bothered with. \n\nHonestly a huge win, you 100% did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nYou did well OP.", "NTA. You could teach classes to other men on how to handle that.", "NTA\n\nWeird that she didn\u2019t already know, and is massively telling that she didn\u2019t call her mum straight away, she obviously didn\u2019t feel safe to. Poor kid probably has her mum blowing up on her all the time.\n\nThe type of man who can sensibly explain stuff like this to a kid is the opposite of a creep tbh.", "You didn\u2019t do anything wrong but now you should refuse to watch Payton going  forward. Her mom has made a normal situation into something suspicious and if I were you I\u2019d not risk having Payton in the house again. Who knows what other normal situations mom might freak out about and possibly call the police over. NTA for not turning the girls first period into a big deal.", "NTA\nI think you handled it appropriately and calmly. You might have asked Payton if she wanted to call your wife, mom or grandmother to talk to them but if she was fine I think following her lead on who she wanted to talk to and when was fine. The main thing was to let her know it was normal and make sure she had what she needed. Your wife did not feel the need to call her sister either.\n\nYou guys are doing her a favor by letting Payton stay at your house when the mom is traveling. If she does not feel comfortable with leaving her child at your house because you can talk about periods then she can make other arrangements.", "NTA. I think you did fine. She was upset, you comforted her, and assured her that this was normal. It sounds like her mom failed to prepare her for this event and your SIL is the asshole for failing at that and for having her ridiculous rage tantrum. I can see why her daughter didn't call her right away herself.", "NTA. But your SIL sure is. She had every opportunity to talk to your niece before this happened to prepare her. Instead, she ignored it, and your niece ended up scared because she didn't know what was happening. \n\nThank you for helping your niece, explaining what was happening, and not making her feel bad for it.", "NTA, you sound great", " NTA I think your SIL should be thanking you. OP, you did amazing and deserve kudos. Thank you for not making your niece getting her period a thing, and just rolling with it.", "You did great. Kate can take her attitude elsewhere.", "NTA \n\nWhy can't an uncle help his niece who's going through a life changing natural thing without being made to feel shit about it?? \n\nWhy can't we normalise that not everything has to be gender specific?? \n\nOP was there at the time the niece came on, was he just supposed to leave her sat on the toilet? If he had, her trust in her uncle would have been completely ruined. I imagine in her eyes, her entire life just exploded and she needed help. Her uncle was there to help her with as much information he could provide. \n\nWhat if OP was a single dad with a teen daughter who was going through this? Does he run out of the house to find the next closest female to talk to her? No!! He helps his daughter in her time of need!\n\nI agree OP should have let SIL know after he had sorted his niece out and calmed her down. Or ask his niece whether he was okay to tell her mother or whether she wanted to do it. \n\nBut in NO WAY should SIL have made OP feel like he had just done something unspeakable to his niece and what's worse to use his niece as a weapon. \n\nSIL is undoubtedly upset that she wasn't there to help her daughter but her reaction was completely uncalled for.\n\nI really hope OPs relationship with his niece is unaffected by this but I fear that ship may have sailed. I'm sorry OP.\n\nAgain NOT THE ASSHOLE!", "NTA. You sound like an amazing uncle who handled it perfectly. You also recognized that it was not your news to share. I would have also assumed that Payton would call or text to tell her mom if she wanted to. Kate should feel grateful you were there to help. What did she want you to do? Leave her daughter bleeding and crying until your wife got home, when there was a simple solution (\u201cHere\u2019s a pad to use. Your aunt can explain more when she gets home\u201d). It seems very sexist to say that only a woman can help her in her time of need. It\u2019s not like you helped her insert a tampon ffs.", "NTA. Your sister is one of those people who see this as a bad that happens every month to women and it\u2019s a taboo subject not to be discussed out loud. \n\nYou however, made Payton feel like this was a natural thing that happens to females and it\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. You gave her a very positive experience and I applaud you for that. \n\nNTA", "You did an awesome job..you handled it so well your wife should be proud of you!", "NTA. \n\nOP did a supportive thing by reassuring niece and comforting her that this is normal. Can you imagine the thoughts going through niece's mind if she had to wait for OP's wife or the mom to come home?\n\nOP sounds like a cool uncle to hang out with.", "NTA - I think having a male explain it could be off putting for her, but she trusted you enough to tell you about everything. For you to be able to help her with a tough experience is very strong of you. If you just left her there, she would have probably felt disgusting and embarrassed if it wasn't addressed right away. Good for you for helping her out the best you could", "NTA\n\nAlso, definitely not creepy. You are an upstanding guy and a hell of an uncle. Since your wife wasn't there, you definitely did the right thing.", "Payton's mother realises that she has 'missed a step'.  She knows that she should have discussed this issue with her daughter some time ago.  Now, **she feels guilty** that you had to step in and essentially take her place during an important event in her daughter's life.\n\nShe is taking that guilt out on you.  Her anger at herself, guilt and resentment that you were there for her daughter when she wasn't came out as anger - pretty explosive and destructive anger at that.  \n\nIt's understandable but, not acceptable.  I suggest you wait until the 'heat' has gone out of the situation and you and your wife sit down with your sister, reassure her as to how the situation with Payton was handled.   You have nothing to apologise for and your sister does but, it may take some time and distance for her to realise that.", "You did great and your SIL is an AH. Payton clearly was fine because you took care of her so well. And hella shame on her for trying to make you feel creepy - that makes me so mad for you! \n\nMy son\u2019s GF got hers when he was a teen so he came up to make her tea, grab some midol, asked me for a pad and if he could borrow my heating pad. \n\nYou guys are the future and I\u2019m so glad!", "NTA, but your sister is for not preparing her daughter for periods BEFORE she had one.", "NTA you handled the situation perfectly. Your SIL however is TA - she should have told your niece that this is something that would happen and prepared her for it", "NTA. I suppose it would have been a good idea to tell Payton you need to let her mom know about it and give her a call, but not thinking of that doesn\u2019t make you an asshole at all. You handled it well and honestly her mom sounds a bit batshit. I for one would be thankful in her shoes. Especially since you didn\u2019t touch the kid or have her disrobe at any point. THEN you would be a creep. But that didn\u2019t happen so she is being nuts.", "Definitely NTA and good for you for taking the time to talk her through it all! However my brain instantly thought of [this scene](https://youtu.be/gV-aFh2ao0E)", "NTA- your sil is a huge one though. She knows she travels leaving her preteen daughter with family. Why hasn\u2019t she packed a hygiene bag for her with supplies and prepared her for this while she is away. Also you mention your niece is highly emotional during situations and I wonder where she has learned this, you say sil over reacts quite frequently. I wouldn\u2019t let her get away with this, you do her a huge favor by watching her kid on a regular basis and in return for guiding her daughter thru a big life event she calls you a creepy pervert ( who else is she saying this to?) instead of buying you a bottle of your favorite wine and being grateful for such a dependable family member. Personally she would put on a time out and would have to hugely apologize before she was welcomed back.", "NTA. Your sister didn\u2019t properly educate her daughter on her body and you were forced to step in and help. I do think you should have informed your sister, but her reaction is extreme.", "NTA, you handled it perfectly. Periods are normal and you showed her this. You also showed her that it was perfectly okay to talk about and that she shouldn't be ashamed about talking about periods with boys/men, something that will help her not to be ashamed in the future. Many boys and even adult men act disgusted about periods and make girls/women feel ashamed about something totally normal happening with their body.\n\nThere was nothing inappropriate about you providing her with menstrual products and explaining the situation to her. Periods are not some secret taboo topic that only women should know or speak of, despite what our culture tries to push sometimes. The fact that she didn't seem to know what was going on (at least not fully) tells me that her parents failed her. If you had left her in the bathroom with no pads and no explanation of what was happening or any reassurance provided then you would be TA.", "NTA\n\nBut in my opinion you or your wife should have told her mum shortly after", "NTA: You played a father figure at a difficult time. Your SIL got pissed. Tell her to get someone else to take care of her child. I'd bet the girl would rather stay with your wife and you. Has anyone asked her about staying with you around other family present?", "NTA.  As far as I can tell, you acted exactly like a lot of women say they *want*  guys to act: you were matter of fact, didn't act like it was something disgusting or to be ashamed of, and had supplies on hand.", "NTA. You did the adult thing and helped her understand that everything she is going through was normal.  Your SIL is wrong for yelling at you. Couldn't leave her in the bathroom sobbing.", "NTA, you were compassionate and helped this little lady the way she needed. If anything, her mother failed her, she should have already known, that one day, something like this would happen to her, and that it is absolutely natural. \nOtherwise it\u2019s freaking scary. Thinking \u201cAm I dying?\u201d because your mum is to scared to have conversation about bodily functions with you is atrocious!", "NTA and let\u2019s talk about how a man she trusts explaining a period without showing any disgust will do wonders for her confidence. It\u2019s showing her that she shouldn\u2019t be scared or ashamed of it at all when most men show disgust over periods. You did right by your niece.", "NTA AT ALL! Would she have liked her daughter to stay distraught and in bloody clothes?! You did the right thing", "NTA in the slightest. I'm very curious to hear what your wife said about your argument with SIL. Does she support you? Or is she siding with her sister? I'd also be curious to hear if Payton says something to you in the future regarding the incident. \n\nYou showed her great kindness and compassion and I commend you for that.", "NTA, I think you handled it perfectly. There was no reason to freak out!", "You never mentioned Payton's age. Maybe she's a super early bloomer and mom missed explaining things to her, because she's only ten...No doesn't really make sense either... I mean my 5yo BOY knows that women bleed once a month. So if Payton really didn't know what was going on, her mother fucked up badly... Which I can somehow imagine really well, considering she was freaking out so much a MAN handled her daughter's first period.\n\nMaybe, we should be nice with Kate. Maybe she just needs someone to help her overcome her own shame regarding her own period. You however, OP, are most definitely NTA but a hero. Although you could have mentioned it to Kate. I would want to know if my (nonexistent) daughter had her first period, because it is a special event, and I would want to celebrate it (like my mom did with me :D)\n\nEdit: I just found a comment in which OP clarifies Payton knew about periods and what it was, but was freaking out nonetheless (which is understandable. The hormones alone...) The rest of my statement stands. You handled it great.", "ESH.\n\nDid you need to call Kate immediately? No.  Should you have failed to tell her AT ALL and sent her daughter home mid-first-period without a heads up?  Absolutely not.\n\nShe deserves a heads up.  That\u2019s her kid - and it\u2019s gotta be extra painful to have to be away from her like this and not be there when her kid needed help and guidance.  And that someone she doesn\u2019t know so well was the person who did it, when it could\u2019ve been her sister.\n\nYou/your wife should\u2019ve been better about this.  You weren\u2019t a creep for helping your niece, but you WERE for feeling entitled to talk about it with your niece but not her own mother.", "Kate feels guilty she missed Payton\u2019s menstrual debut while she was away for work. It\u2019s not about you. You handled it just how I\u2019d want an uncle of any kid of mine to handle that situation. I bet the dust settles and things go back to normal with your family - but Kate owes you a huge apology. NTA", "This seems to be a repost.\n\nAnd still NTA. Kid needed to be educated and helped with a natural biological process.", "NTA. The only thing you could have done is maybe text your wife to text Kate to let her know what was going on as it would be easier to hear it from your wife than you, imo. Also, you\u2019d have to do the exact same things even if you did call your wife or Kate, unless you are supposed to just let her wait around for your wife to get home. Kate is irrational.", "Kate and daughter are SO lucky to have you.  You handled it perfectly.  And your wife didn\u2019t tell her either right?  And they\u2019re sisters. You are NOT TA.", "Easiest NTA I\u2019ve ever given. Kate sounds like a horrible mother and SIL. I hope your wife tore her a new one. SMH. You did the heavy lifting of parenting - something she should have done if she was a decent parent (which she\u2019s not) - and explained to your niece, who was going through a traumatic experience, that it was a normal biological process and nothing to be concerned or embarrassed about. \n\nKate can\u2019t have it both ways. Periods can\u2019t be so embarrassing that men can\u2019t have anything to do with it, and at the same time men are expected to inform mothers what\u2019s happening immediately. What does she expect you to say? \u201cKate, something is happening with Peyton\u2019s lady parts. I have you on speaker so you can talk to her through the closed door while she\u2019s sobbing hysterically.\u201d WTF?\n\nJust out of curiosity, does Kate travel around and lick stamps for a living? Because that is the only job I can think of that she\u2019d be qualified for given her intelligence level. You did good work and don\u2019t deserve abuse. The only thing that should\u2019ve happened was that your wife should\u2019ve told her sister what happened when she came to pick her up - not because she\u2019s a woman, but because it was her sister. No reason to inform Kate immediately. It\u2019s not a medical emergency, but she should\u2019ve been informed at some point because kids aren\u2019t the best with communication.", "Nta. Your sister trusted you to take care of her child in her absence, and you did. She got her period, you informed mom. What did she want you to do?! Personally I would think it would be Peyton\u2019s role to Inform her mother. Your sister is the ahole.8\nIf she didn\u2019t think you could handle it, then she shouldn\u2019t leave her in your care", "NTA. Just based on your version I'd say you did really well! Thank for being so kind to her and also for respecting her privacy and not telling anyone. It's really her private business and she should have the opportunity to tell her mom herself. It's not your fault if their relationship isn't quite there so that she could feel safe sharing these things with her mom right away. \n\nI really think the mom was projecting as she kinda failed her daughter here by not preparing her for this in any way. Years late in sexual education..", "NTA\n\nAnd honestly good on you for approaching a very sensitive subject with a wonderful response. I personally think if your niece wanted to talk about her bodily functions with her mom it should be her choice to do so. You just showed your niece that there are men are capable of handling a woman\u2019s health situation.", "NTA calling you a creep and it inappropriate She is reinforcing the problem. There is a decent amount of men out there who think periods are gross and nasty Your sister-in-law is helping That stereotypes stay alive. \n\nAlso, personally, I would say don\u2019t allow her in your house  she calls you a creep and think there isnt consequences no that doesn\u2019t work that way\n\nAnd also wanted to wait for another woman to tell her  the girl was freaking out This was the best solution\n\nYour sister-in-law sounds like she\u2019s a hoot", "NTA.\n\nPeriods are a natural bodily function. They happen. Monthly. For decades. It\u2019s ridiculous to treat them like they\u2019re mysterious or taboo in modern times.\n\nKate overreacted and either was embarrassed because she didn\u2019t do her job as a mom and prepare her daughter for the eventuality of a period OR she has some weird misogynistic views around who can discuss periods and who can\u2019t.", "NTA. OPs responses only solidify that vote further.", "NTA. However you definitely should have told her mom as soon as possible. This is sometimes special to some moms and daughters and moms want to explain it to their daughters themselves as a bonding moment. However you did the right thing by reassuring her it was okay and making sure she was cared for.", "NTA but Kate is. Payton is lucky to have you & your wife.", "NTA. Her mother is for not teaching her daughter what to expect years ago.", "NTA you did well. Your sister is creepy by acting this way.", "NTA  You rock.   You're sister should be grateful you handled it as well as you did.  Most importantly, you taught your niece that her period is nothing shameful that she needs to hide from people of the opposite sex.  Kudos my man.", "This is so crazy for me.\n\n Both my daughter and her husband my granddaughter\u2019s dad was home with me when she got her first period and I asked her if she wanted her mom and she told me no to please get her dad!\n No one got butt hurt like Kate did.\n\n To me this was just over the top of Mama Drama!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell your SIL: If she does not like how you parent her kid, she can do the parenting herself. An absent parent does not get to set rules.", "NTA. That\u2019s called misandry.", "NTA. You had a frightened kid in front of you who needed reassurance and for things to be treated as normal, and you stepped up wonderfully to reassure her and make things ok. You absolutely bossed the shit outta that.\n\n~~I would have sent SIL a text to let her know though, just out of courtesy~~. She was still absolutely wrong to go off on you though, and everything she threw at you is total nonsense. Probably embarrassed at the fact she never told her kid what to expect herself.\n\nETA: Just seen on another comment that you asked Peyton if she wanted you to tell her Mum and she said no, so actually scratch my comment about telling the SIL. That was a fantastic way to respect your niece's autonomy and privacy. Bossed the shit outta that too.", "NTA you did great, plus made sure you wife could help out as well when she got home. I do think you should have mentioned it to your SIL so she heard what happened directly from you though.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nKate is by a landslide! There are *signs* (height, breast buds, armpit hair, etc) that menstruation is coming, there is zero reason poor Peyton was so ill informed! Of course the first time is still a shock, but she should have known *exactly* what was happening and why, and had a basic understanding of how to handle it, etc. All she should have had to do was ask for supplies.\n\nAs a mom to daughters I have the *\"First Period Box\"* ready and clearly labeled in the closet. My 9.5 year twin daughters have been pep talked about it (only 1 is close physically, but hey why talk twice...) Its got pads, pantyliners, teen tampons, period panties, a clutch purse, etc, in there. My kids have been given a few books on puberty. We've had ongoing age appropriate conversations for years. \n\nThere is zero advantage to not preparing my daughters. Its gonna happen. Its easier for everyone if they are mentally prepared.", "NTA your niece needed to know what was going on then and there not wait for a day or two. I think Payton\u2019s mom WAY overreacted.  It\u2019s possible the poor girl is afraid to be around you, but not because she thinks you\u2019re a creep. She\u2019s likely beyond embarrassed, unfortunately her mom embarrassed her more by yelling at you and making a larger deal out of it", "NTA. I wish all dads/uncles/men reacted more like you did.", "NTA - mom should've taught her what was going to happen. Kate should've been told that it happened when she was picked up, though. Calling up Kate the second it happened would've been insane", "How was it that Payton didn't know what was going on? That she was *crying* about it? She doesn't know her mom gets her period? \n\nYour sister is a mega asshole for not communicating the facts of life to Payton. And for not being a trusted authority figure in the girls life. If she called you and flipped out over this, I can only assume she similarly flips out on Payton over nonsense at home. \n\nWhy did your sister call you two days later? I am guessing Payton chose not share this with her mom as soon as she got home ... otherwise you would have gotten the screaming phone call right away ... and that delay says something about their relationship. Your first period kinda a big deal, as a mile marker for adulthood and all,  but Payton didn't want to talk to her mom about it?", "NTA. You handled it exactly right. Good man!", "SIL is a raging AH! You are NTA and big props OP!", "NTA. \n\nYou should have definitely notified the mother though but I don't think that makes you an AH. \n\nHowever, Kate is really over-reacting. I applaud you for actually knowing what to do in this situation because a lot of men don't, but you handled it great! \n\nYou are not a creepy, or an AH or inappropriate. Kate however sounds extremely sexist. She needs to get over herself real quick and realize that you handled it great. \n\nHonestly you handled it better than my own mother did who basically told me nothing, just that it was expected and \"Welcome to womanhood\" which was unhelpful. \n\nYou did a great job, and if you ever have daughters they will be luck to have you as their father!", "Nta. She tjink it s a woman problem and project her view on payton. You do nothing wrong. Why you are at fault and not her sister who dont call her neither.??", "This would have been so much worse if you had made her wait until your wife was home. She would have grown up believing that a period is wrong and dirty and shouldn't be spoken about in the presence of men or anyone that's not an immediate female family member.\nDoing what you did showed her that it's natural and nothing to be embarrassed about. You also let her know that you are someone she can come and speak with whenever she might need somebody.", "NTA\n\nYou did everything right and made sure Payton knew it was normal and made her feel better. \n\nNot only is her mom TAH for screaming at you , but she\u2019s also an AH for not explaining things to her child well BEFORE this happened. Poor Payton should\u2019ve been prepared.", "ESH\n\nYeah, when something significant happens to the kid in your care, you let the parent know. You screwed that up\n\nCalling you a creep is too far", "Honestly you showed her the healthy reaction that men should have. Too many times I hear about men, spouses, bfs acing ignorant or cruel when it comes to periods. My son actually saw and asked about blood in the bathroom and we had a talk about it.", "You definitely did nothing wrong. It was nice that you as a male tried to help her. Your sister needs to get a grip.", "NTA \u2026.buuuut I think you should be calling the mom and not handling this yourself.  Slightly poor judgement, not the end of the world.", "NTA you did great! Don't let someone tell you otherwise.", "you are not the AH when my 11 year old daughter started her period she was so embarrassed as she has 3 older brothers and she thought she had to hide it from them but even without me or there dad saying anything they say with her and told her it\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of and it\u2019s a perfectly natural thing for a woman to go through and made her feel so at ease about it. woman/girls need to realise it\u2019s normal and not something to be ashamed of kate is definitely the AH for expecting you not to handle the situation to the best of your ability and you did a great job well done", "Kate needs to be a better mother because my mother explain to me what a period was before I got it so I didn\u2019t think I was dying. But It\u2019s a terrifying experience, even when you knew it was happening. Nta I think what you did was amazing for the opposite sex. sounds like you was patient and very understanding. And I\u2019m sure your wife know that any future daughters they would be in great hands with a father like you.", "NTA - I'm sure there's some guilt coming from Kate that she wasn't there to support, from what I understand as a man it's kind of a big deal for ladies when it happens the first time. I could've seen a \"hey, Payton had her first period, it's handled and she's good but you might wanna call her\" text being appropriate because it's a big life event and she wasn't informed. That feels like where the anger -could- be coming from, despite it being misplaced. \n\nYou did nothing wrong, have your wife mediate the issue since it's her sister. We don't know any of the language or anything used, we don't know some important details, but on the nose this seems fine.", "OP should have told the mom. \nA girl's period is a big deal, you as the adult figure should have contacted the mom and let her know what is going on. \nI would honestly question your ability to be a guardian for children if you don't even know that much.", "Thank you for helping your niece through her first experience with periods. It could have been traumatic - especially if you'd left her alone in there, waiting for some woman to be available to do exactly what you did. Disregard your SIL as best you can. Payton will let you know when she's comfortable, and when she's not.\n\nIf SIL wants to be angry, she can fault herself for not having prepared her daughter for this. You are not inappropriate or a creep. \n\nNTA", "Nta and your reaction and help was perfect. Normal and calm, informative and helpful. You should be proud and have been raised well.", "NTA. She wanted you to wait for your wife to get home. So she wanted her kid to be freaking out until her aunt came home. That would have been way more damaging to her. You did the right thing by helping her as you could. Men should be educated on periods anyway. It\u2019s not some dirty secret and maybe more men would know more and do better. You were completely appropriate with your niece. Honestly I\u2019d reconsider watching the kiddo unless Kate apologizes and can verbally state why she was wrong. You do not deserve to be berated.", "I had a horrible experience with my first period. I'm glad you were kind, knowledgeable, and told your wife.

She let her daughter down by not preparing her through talk, books, etc.", "NTA at all.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n My dad would buy my sister and I menstrual products as would my brother if we needed them.  My mom wanted us to use her old lady products.  The ones you can absolutely see through your clothes.  My dad was all \"hell no\" and got us more appropriate ones.  \n\n\n   Imagine all these men not ashamed or embarrassed of normal thing?  Life would be so much better if this was  the norm.  Since my sister and I were on the same cycle my dad would go out and buy our favorite comfort foods.  And of course my brother got his too, because he's a person and didn't deserve to be left out.  So every 28 days we ate like royalty.", "NTA--you did nothing wrong.  You helped a frightened girl, who apparently was not instructed about getting her period by her parents.  You were not inappropriate or creepy as far as your post indicates.  I'm sorry your SIL freaked out on you.  I would not have Peyton at your home any longer with her mother making all these accusations, and especially if Peyton is uncomfortable around you now.  Peyton is probably uncomfortable as she might of been embarrassed and did not know was going on.", "I see, so her brother is fine to be trusted with her daughter's safety and day to day welfare when she's not around, but heaven forced he step in and actually take *care* of his niece when she needs it. I bloody love how people lump their responsibilities onto others but then get shitty when they don't follow all the unwritten invisible rules of 'their way'.\n\nNTA. Kate is. What a shower. Poor kiddo is probably mortified about her body now due to her mum's reaction.", "NTA. You did wonderful. Too many men shy away from what is a normal process. I suspect your niece knew her mother would react the way she did (freak out and make a big deal) and she didn\u2019t want that. It is also telling that your SIL did not prepare her daughter for this possibility. \n\nI started when I was 8 and knew exactly what was happening because it was normalized growing up. My girls all started around 10 and I started preparing then when they were 8. The year before they started I made sure they had a change of clothes and all the products in their backpacks so if it happened at school they would be ready. My husband has pictures of the brands and items our girls prefer saved on his phone so he always knows what to get. \n\nOn a side note: my mother is the 3rd of 4 girls with an oldest brother. My uncle was often sent to buy all the supplies when shark week was on in their house. Each one of the girls (plus my grandmother) had wildly different flows and preferences so it was crazy the amount of period products. One time my grandfather\u2019s brother went with him(Mind, this is in the mid to late 1970s).The cashier addressed my uncle in a snotty tone and asked, \u201cDo you think you bought enough?!\u201d My uncle draped his arm around his uncle\u2019s shoulder and replied, \u201cWell, I am having a sex change next week and just couldn\u2019t decide which one I wanted!\u201d She shut up real quick and his uncle refused to ever go shopping with him again. Lol. My uncle was always prepared and never let it bother him.", "Is it possible your SIL is feeling guilty about being away from her daughter so often, so she\u2019s lashing out because she missed this big happening in her daughter\u2019s life and wasn\u2019t able to be there for her?\n\nYou\u2019re NTA for helping her, being that your wife wasn\u2019t home. Unfortunately, it might have made Payton feel uncomfortable even if she didn\u2019t express it, that a man was helping her with a female issue. I don\u2019t know her age, but going through puberty can be embarrassing for a lot of preadolescents/adolescents. I would\u2019ve been mortified if I got my first period and a man was the one helping me through it. BUT, even if that is the case, you were the only one able to help her at that time, and it sounds like you did it with compassion and care. You weren\u2019t being creepy and busting in on her half-naked or anything.\n\nSIL should have done something to educate her daughter herself about periods, as it sounds like Payton didn\u2019t even know what was happening. (Unless Payton is quite young and SIL didn\u2019t think it would happen yet, though it\u2019s still a bit naive to not prepare your kid.) Maybe part of her lashing out is guilt over that too?\n\nI do think, though, someone should\u2019ve contacted SIL as getting your first period is a big deal, especially if Payton is young (I\u2019m unsure of age). It\u2019s not like \u201chey just so you know, we had Macca\u2019s for lunch\u201d. Though again, can\u2019t really fault you because you reasonably assumed Payton would be the one to tell her mum. Unless Payton was feeling embarrassed to? Being that she was unprepared for a period to begin with, perhaps these topics are more taboo around the house? Or with SIL being away a lot, maybe it\u2019s hard for Payton to discuss things with her? Could also have made SIL feel guilty (not that guilt is an excuse for lashing out to you, but it\u2019s easier to blame someone else than looking inward).\n\nI\u2019m sorry you are in this situation now. Try not to take it personally. When things calm down maybe it will be easier to have a conversation with SIL about why it happened like it did.", "No you're NTA. In fact you're uncle of the year in my eyes. Way to handle it with grace and get her fixed up while not freaking her out more. You should have called her mother but it's okay you were probably a little panicky too.

I cannot imagine what Payton was thinking. \n\nEven in the 70s my mom prepared me in advance!", "[removed]", "You and your wife handled the situation beautifully.  I\u2019m sure that her mother is beating herself up that she wasn\u2019t there for Peyton, but that\u2019s not your fault. She should not be taking her guilt out on you. She should instead be grateful that she has loving family that helps her and takes stellar, loving care of her daughter when she has to travel for work.", "NTA.  Bravo for handling this the way you did, and for making it a normal thing.  You could've had Payton call her mom or you coudl've called her just to fill her in, but it definitely doesn't make you a creep.", "NTA\n\nWhy the hell didn't she know what was happening?

Her mother is the asshole for not educating her daughter and then for freaking out on you for being a super awesome uncle!\n\nDo you live in a foreign country, or is this family just super religious because I just don't understand why she didn't know what was happening!", "NTA. You handled it perfectly. Her mom is one though for not preparing her for periods. All my girls had supplies and knew what to expect and why it would happen well in advance. However, as a mother I would be hurt not to be made aware as soon as possible of that important milestone in my daughter\u2019s life. That\u2019s the only offense I find you committed.", "NTA you were the caregiver of this child while the family was away. If she can't trust you to aide in a non creepy way with that child getting a period when the child is likely around that age she should have chosen only a female caregiver and specified specifically the child wasn't to be cared for by any males. This is ultimately ridiculous", "Seriously? That's awful. I have sisters and all my cousins are girls so I grew up with this being very normalized.", "OP did handle it well. \n\nBut why did Payton not even know what a period is? what kind of abusive idiot is Kate. Ah right the kind of abusive idiot who shouts at a man for taking over in an emergency\n\nIt is abusive to let your daughter clueless and unprepared for her first period. \n\nKate is an abuser.

Op did a great job in handling the situation. There are many men who are uncomfortable and just pretend that a period isn\u2019t happening. \n\nOp went straight in and made sure his niece wasn\u2019t ashamed, stoped her from completely freaking out since it was the first, and knew how to use pads. He\u2019s a great uncle. NTA", "I vividly remember one of my first periods. I rolled up my pad and put it in the rubbish bin. A few hours later my male family member said he saw it in the bin and was \"disgusted\" and said: \"Ladies need to wrap those up in toilet roll to hide them so the men don't see, then add more toilet roll on top just to make sure it's hidden for the men.\"\n\nI remember feeling so dirty. Embarassed. Ashamed. \n\nFuck this. Normalising periods for ALL GENDERS I'd so important. NTA, OP. Thanks for being a good guy!!!", "NTA but Kate is. Payton should not have been surprised or needing explanation because those should have been given years ago by her parents/Kate already so Payton would know what\u2019s going on the 1st time she got her periods.\nOP did everything right by not making it a big deal and keeping things matter-of-fact and ensuring his niece was comfortable and not freaked out", "I agree, I think you did a great thing. It's important we normalise talking about periods and it's okay to talk about to/with different genders, and not some embarrassing taboo thing to be ashamed of/ keep quiet about.", "I think it also helps teach Peyton that men should treat periods as normal. Hopefully, help her avoid some of the \"hid your used tampons\" period shaming assholes we see on this sub.", "Perfectly put! My daughter talks to her dad and male friends if she needs to and there\u2019s no issue or stigma. She feels normal as she should but it was very different when I was younger. Op did great.", "Right, that failure is on the mom.", "Okay but thats a perfectly normal reaction to your first period even for those of us who knew what it was beforehand. Being emotionally and physically overwhelmed at your first period isn\u2019t abnormal, it\u2019s a totally new thing and the pain of cramps is totally new as well.

Mom should have warned her. But like I'm not surprised, she's not the one parenting as she's not around", "For real!! She should not have been sent to school or anywhere overnight without a period kit and education about how to use it. Even if she's on the young side, she had to have had signs of puberty like breast development and body hair. Isn't that basic parenting for girls?", "She did know, but thought it wouldn't happen until she was older. He clarified in another comment. The mom isn't remiss. He 100% should have called her immediately.", "Yeah. That was my thought too. I asked her after she was cleaned up and not crying anymore if she wanted to talk to her mom or grandma and she said she was fine. She has her own phone so she could have called or texted if she wanted to. She didn't so I didn't feel the need to step over her.", "Hey, don't lump all women together in this. I haven't seen a single woman in this threading saying op is the ah. We all agree it's a shitty reaction from Kate. NTA", "Dang, sorry your father was a prick about it.

My wife keeps emergency tampons in my glovebox and I've never cared.", "I would get sick when I got my period. Like day off from school sick.\n\nAnd my dad would just come by my room and go \"do you need anything?\" He hated that I felt that bad and there was nothing he could do about it.", "I agree in general, but maybe with the slight tweak that knowing how Kate is \"explosive\", OP's wife (Kate's sister) might should've been the one to tell her. Not that Kate deserves much in the way of consideration here, but if the premise is \"an adult should communicate with another adult about the child's situation\", then maybe sister-to-sister would work better, and might have avoided some of Kate's bulls\\*\\*\\*.", "She's a pre-teen. She knows but I think she only thought this happened to older girls.

And I would be even more mortified if my mom had the same reaction that OPs sister-in-law is having. OP is NTA and handled that situation according to how his niece would feel about it. It is nieces body, and his nieces experience, so I feel like it makes more sense to cater to his niece in this situation.", "Same! My kids knew how periods worked for years before anyone got theirs. I stocked my house with pads about a year before my daughter started her period, and also provided her with a kit to keep in her school backpack, and a kit to keep at her dad\u2019s house. When she did start, I asked her if she wanted me to give her dad a heads up and she said yes. I sent my ex a quick text telling him what he needed to buy for his house, and that was that.

She could decide for herself after the initial shock.", "All of this! \n\nNTA\n\nOP, the fact Peyton DIDN'T know what was going on is very telling to me. Her own mother didn't explain things and should have months, if not years ago. Mom wants someone to blame for her own deficiency in preparing HER child for the inevitable. \n\nGood for you for not shying away and letting her suffer through this entirely alone.

Of course I would call her if something was wrong, like if Payton was sick or hurt, but this to me didn't seem like anything was wrong.

The kicker is my wife did tell her, but I guess Kate was under the impression that my wife had handled it. She flipped out when she learned it was actually me, or at least that's what we've gathered.", "Peyton is absolutely old enough to tell her mom herself.

In my opinion, OP did exactly the right thing by not telling her.", ">don't you think her mom should know and be prepared when Payton went home?\n\nWhat's the difference between Payton starting her period at home without notice?

If she did not know what was happening to her when she saw the blood, then there is a lot of information to catch up on.", "Oh, please! If the mom cared so much about this connection she would have explained menstruation to daughter long ago.", "Sure it was totally a better option to let the kid bleed out and waiting for mom to discover her child all soaked w blood so she could bond w her.", "Maybe for some people, but definitely not for everyone.

My daughter has known about periods since she was a toddler. I've always explained it to her, in terms she could understand. Mainly because she would follow me to the bathroom so she would see and ask questions. I'm glad I did that, also as she is an early bloomer. She started hers at 8 and was not shocked and handled it like a boss. Unlike me, I had to learn from the sex ed class in 5th grade and get laughed at when I asked questions.

Is this a period!? Are my kidneys failing!? Oh God there's more! It won't stop! Am I dying!?!*.

Whether because you don't know what's going on, you bled through and have no menstrual supplies, or whatever other reason it's more uncommon to be calm and collected about it. My mom did a very good job preparing me, but she failed to mention that the blood can also come out brown so I thought I was just shitting myself without realizing it when I first got my period.", "No I'm sorry it's still on the parents..\n\nYou can say hey sometime, somewhere you are gonna bleed. That's like minimal parenting.. you may feel like you have informed them but you didn't really..\n\nYou can also help your daughters understand what exactly might happen. You can get books, you can talk about what it entails and what kind of side effects there are. Whatever you feel comfortable about. But they need to know!\n\nSo many girls are not well prepared for their first menstruation because the adults don't want to/are afraid to/wait too long to talk about it. It's such a shame because it's bodily functions we can not ignore, it's gonna happen like it or not.\n\nETA: I didn't get the menstruation talk, I freaked. And I made sure my children would not feel afraid, disgusted or afraid. As so far my oldest (14f) was not afraid, sure she was in pain, but we got her a heated pad, chocolates, some medicine and hugs. She knew what was happening, knew the pain was a part of it but also knew there are things we can do to lessen them. Thats what we need to teach them.", "Honestly, I just waded up toilet paper and went about my day until I could go home and get a pad. I knew where the pads were at home, so it was just a matter of getting them and had already been told to take them when I needed them. I was formally taught in school starting in 3rd grade, and been given the basics by my mom. \n\nAs weird aside, it turns out my mom thought I got my first period at 13 for ages. I got it at 11. We figured out 13 was the first time I asked her to buy pads. She always just replaced them when we started running low, so my sister's and me never had to ask, and she didn't put it together they were running out faster, and I didn't see it as a big deal until I got pickier on the types I liked. My sisters were even younger than I was when they got theirs, so just keeping stocked was easier than figuring out who needed what, but then she switched to a type I found uncomfortable.", "Been having periods for decades, still don\u2019t react positively to its arrival.

Not that you shouldn't have helped her of course, you did everything absolutely perfectly, but maybe Payton would want to talk to her mum and that could have been a conversation to have with Payton once you'd helped her and she was more settled? Like \"how do you feel?

Periods are not sexual, getting someone clothing and pads is not sexual, like wtf?\n\nYou did exactly the right thing, and I also think you were right to let your niece be the one to tell her mom about it.

And how could SIL possibly think that in this situation you should have waited for a woman to come along (????) while your niece was bleeding from her vagina and had no idea what was happening? How could any mother want THAT for her daughter?\n\nI think SIL is embarrassed that you found out she\u2019s a spectacularly shitty mom, and so all she can do to save face in her own mind is lash out as if you\u2019ve done something wrong.\n\nSolid NTA with a side of wtf.", "You handled it like a pro and well done for normalising things.

Your SIL should have prepared her daughter for the inevitable well before it happened and now she is projecting her failure and shame on to you.", "NTA. \n\nBut talk to Peyton and tell her you're sorry you made her feel uncomfortable, her mum called and let you know that she wasn't comfortable with a man explaining things to her. \n\nTell her, her mum said she's uncomfortable being alone with you. But you want her to know that if at any point she wants distance or needs her mum to pick her up or go home. She can tell you, and you'll help her arrange that. \n\nAnd just mention you're sorry, periods are a normal part of life and you just wanted to be helpful. \n\nIt'll let her know her mums being a psycho.", "NTA and you should be applauded.

But what she's saying is dangerous and just plain wrong. It needs to be stopped in its tracks, immediately. So you tell your GF that until those accusations are completely retracted and you are apologised to, it is not safe for anyone to have Payton in your home. She went nuclear instead of being appreciative for you and your GF helping to raise her child, and now she has to pay the price.\n\nAnd if your GF dismisses that ... you have a much bigger problem.

(Agreed in advance, not a walkaway thing.)\n\nNext morning, while making coffee. I get hugged at the wait from behind and I hear a familiar voice that I'm \"the Best Dad Ever\".  We talked over my morning coffee while I set up her favorite board game.  We played and talked, which is something she and I did.  The boardgame \"abstracted\" the \"realness\" of conversations.  Plus, I love boardgames.\n\nI'm just a Dad.  My girls need something, they get it.  If that means Mom.  Fine.  They need me there.  All day, every day.", "NTA your SIL has overreacted. This is a talk she should have had with her before this so she wasn't scared. You treated her with respect and dignity and not to be ashamed.", "My first period made me cry.  Only my dad was home and I locked myself in the upstairs bathroom.  He was very kind and I had two older sisters so he\u2019d been down this road before.  My mom finally arrived and said so clinically, \u201cyou\u2019re menstruating.\u201d  She gave me the pads.  But no sympathy.   I\u2019m glad my dad was there first to comfort me even if it was behind a closed bathroom door.  He said something like \u2018I was growing up and not to be afraid. And mom will be home soon.\u2019", "Story time.\n\nI grew up around animals, even helped midwife litters of puppies and kittens. I knew the whole life cycle. One day my mom is complaining to my dad about her period. So I ask what it was. She explained it to me and I of course made the connection right away. \"OH! So you're in heat!\"\n\nMy dad had to leave the building. Not because he was uncomfortable, but because he was laughing and he knew it was a serious conversation and a serious question. He didn't want me to think it was something that should be hidden so he hid his completely understandable reaction for my benefit.\n\nThen when I finally had mine my mum invites her two best friends over, they drink some wine, offer me a bit, and welcome me to womanhood. THAT was embarrassing.", "My wife told Kate when she picked Payton up. I wasn't home. Kate was not mad at all at that point.

After things were calmed down, and before the girl went home, he should have mentioned it to one of the parents (\u201cOh by the way, Payton had her first period.  I helped calm her down, explained what was going on, and told her how to use a pad.\u201d).  Just like if she had a minor injury at their house; the parents should be informed.  Or maybe offer to tell the parents, and let the girl decide (I bet she\u2019d gladly accept).\n\nIf she\u2019d been having periods for a while, but just needed a pad/tampon, I wouldn\u2019t feel the need to tell the parents.  But first time, and especially because she was unprepared for it, it\u2019s a notable development that the parents should know about.

I don\u2019t take the trash out every day, and when there are period products in the trash can I can smell them (admittedly my nose is very sensitive). This is completely wrapped up, too! I guess there\u2019s the option of bringing used tampons straight outside, I could always dangle them around while my very fragile male neighbor is outside, you know, while I walk to the trash cans. I refuse to use (or make others use) plastic bags for each product once it\u2019s used, what a waste.\n\nI\u2019m considering something like a divacup, which is cheaper than a nice lidded bathroom trash can, considering savings on tampons and liners.

I got my period at 10. My older sister hadn't gotten hers yet (she was 12) so my mom hadn't told either of us about stuff yet, didn't think it was necessary. Until I thought I had cancer because I had the discharge and didn't know what it was. I was a wreck when I told her. I still remember it. My siblings were so salty I missed water polo practice that morning, but my mom yelled at them to leave it alone, and then spent the morning explaining everything to me and showing me how to use the products.

Hell, if it did, this would be easy.", "My mom was a nurse too and I did the same thing! I read her medical books and she got me some books that taught about male and female puberty/periods. She also made me a little box to keep under the bathroom sink or in my room that had pads and tampons in it after we had our first sex ed class in school. I didn\u2019t get my period for 3 or 4 years and was a little confused at the time because it was super light. Lucky me, we had the day off of school and I was home alone so I could re read the books and get used to the idea of what was happening. I told my mom when she got home from work and she gave me a hug then took me out to eat. I\u2019m really thankful for everything she did because it helped make the situation better. It sounds like OP did a great job in making the girl comfortable and it\u2019s also probably going to stick with her that he was helpful and didn\u2019t act repulsed by the situation. She now knows grown men understand and she doesn\u2019t need to be embarrassed. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s for OP or his wife to tell the girls mom, I think the niece should be the one to tell her since it\u2019s her body. It sounds like she wasn\u2019t comfortable enough to share that information with her mom.", "I had the exact same scenario, with mistaking the brown blood for poop. I couldn't understand what happened. I told my mom I pooped myself because she still did my laundry at the time but expressed my confusion because I hadn't felt anything and I felt very sorry and ashamed. She put 2 and 2 together after seeing my undies and realized what happened.

I got my period during the visit, and his dog came walking into the living room with my used pad in his mouth. I was so mortified but everyone thought it was funny and normal.

That being said, I then feel further very privileged to have my own bathroom that is only accessible from inside my bedroom, and, in there, I don\u2019t see it is the business of anyone- in person, or on the internet- as to what kind of trash can I have, how I keep it, what I do and do not put in it, how/if I cover it/with what, etc.\nI recognize, however, that when I was sharing a bathroom with my brother growing up, for instance, the people using the space should both have some reasonable expectation to mutual needs being met via-a-vis the bathroom toilet. This would be similar among spouses/domestic partners- with the caveat that people just simply shouldn\u2019t be made to feel ashamed of their needs.

My mum thought she was dying when she got her first period, and by God she was not going to let that happen to her daughters.", "I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s the same for men as it is women. Even if you know the theory of what\u2019s going to happen, it\u2019s always different in the moment than you imagined. It would be horrifying to have no clue your body is going to do certain things as you enter puberty and then they happen. I said it in another comment but you handled this extremely well. I don\u2019t know what else you could have done, let her be scared? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s for you or your wife to tell the mom.

So I was straight up looking for it every time I went to the bathroom. Of course I got it during gym class. I yelled to my friend that I finally got it and needed something.

I have, for years. Usually, they get wrapped in paper or the packaging of a new one, but sometimes, esspecially if someone is sick or changing in the middle of the night (esspecially for younger teens), that full-goopy pad/tamp gets tossing in the can just as it is.
