Never call them or message them back without getting more information from different sources first.  Call your parents.  Call other family or family friends. Check google.  Check the social media that people you are concerned about use.  \n\nYou can get information as to not feed into their bullshit.  *She killed your fucking cat.* Now she is spiraling and can't cope after she set you up, you called back in a panic, and replied in anger because she played you.

It is your right to decide to apologize and reconnect or not. If being around her negatively affects your mental health then its probably best to cut ties. \n\nI do have a question though. Like with the incident with your cat.

Diagnoses are not excuses, and to be honest ADHD isn't even a particularly good one to try to hide behind for her actions.  It doesn't excuse her behavior at all and I would be done with her too.", "NTA. I've got a younger sister that was first diagnosed bipolar, and then later schizophrenic instead. She sort of refuses to acknowledge the shitty things she did and said and what she still puts us all through when she has episodes (usually cause she stops taking her meds - full blown psychosis with paranoia and voices). I play as nice as I can at holidays but I do not like my sister. I don't need apologies, but I do need acknowledgement and to really see her taking her condition seriously, and she doesn't really do either. I've told my parents similar to you OP (not quite so drastic maybe). I talk to and see my parents all the time because they understood why I needed to be so LC with my sister. My sister causes me incredible anxiety. I find it hard to relax around her, and in bad moods just about everything she says becomes triggering. I'm working on it, for myself mostly, but also for my mom. It's not easy though, when there's decades of resentment and problems to sort through. My parents respect my need and do not keep me informed of her episodes.\n\nYour sister's diagnoses, like my sister's, are not her FAULT, but they are her RESPONSIBILITY. And part of that means acknowledging hurt they have caused even if without their knowledge or direct control. It also means acknowledging that some hurts can't be repaired. \n\nI've set some clear and firm boundaries. I had to make it very, very clear to my parents that I would never forgive my sister if she did something to take attention at my wedding (her favorite is to search for sympathy with litanies of ailments - she's also just kind of obnoxious aside from the actual mental illness), and that I did not want my parents or other close people babysitting her either. I seriously considered not inviting her at all, and she certainly wasn't in my wedding party or invited to get ready with us. My mom had friends of hers who knew the drill ready to step in if she got up to her typical stuff. Aside from 'spraining her ankle' walking into my rehearsal dinner (which I had so clearly predicted that even my mother laughed with me later), she was on her best behavior and I'm grateful for that.\n\nSo, I really do get it OP. Maybe if you're willing to hear your sister make real acknowledgement of the hurt she's caused you, you could let your parents know that. I've told my mother that in response to her \"wanting us all to get along and be close\". She knows my terms, it's in her court now. If you're not willing to do that now, that's ok too. Maybe be open to it in the future if you see real changes from your sister?", "NTA. The diagnoses might explain the behavior, but it doesn't excuse the behavior. We still have to take responsibility for crappy stuff we do in the midst of a mental ill health episode. I've absolutely lost friends when I've been super irritable and paranoid (anti-anxiety meds stopped working after 15 years). Figuring out that I was in the midst of an active episode only explained and helped me be more mindful of such behavior. It did not excuse it.", "NTA at all! Just because she's ADHD and autistic doesn't immediately excuse all the shit she did, feel bad for your parents having to deal with that but you were very respectful with them about what was going on so NTA and well done for getting a character that wore down your mental health out of ur life", "NTA and there was no olive branch all she did was give an explanation to try and excuse her past behavior. A boundary was set that OP didn\u2019t want sister in her life the diagnosis doesn\u2019t change that. The news of sister\u2019s diagnosis should have been conveyed via the parent\u2019s.", "NTA. She TOTALLY thought this would be her get out of jail free card and  you would have to forgive her for all her bad behavior.  It was NOT an olive branch.  If she really thought about YOU, she would have sent a letter or card.\n\nYou are not wrong here and the fact that your parents are blaming you tells us why she thought she would get away with this.", "Autism and ADHD can do a whole ton to how one responds to the world.  But understanding that a thing you've done has hurt someone else is not part of that equation.  I don't blame you for rejecting the \"olive branch\" and thinking it was a \"get out of jail free card\".  That's a very reasonable interpretation.\n\nI think your anger has more to do with how she (and kind of your parents) never really saw things from your perspective.  Maybe when she apologizes and takes some sort of responsibility for her actions, you can (tentatively) let her back into her life.  \n\nBut this diagnosis doesn't seem to be helping her see things from any view but her own - it really sounds to me that she's passing the buck again.\n\nNTA", "To be clear, Ann is not responsible for *other people* bullying you. If her behavior upset other people then that still does not make her at fault for them then choosing to target *you*.\n\nAnd while I'll accept that Ann may be responsible for your cat's death, your comments make it sound less like she killed your cat and more like your cat died while she was home. I understand that you have trouble talking about it, but without more context it's impossible to know... well, to know how much she's really at fault here.\n\nI agree that it sounds like it was very difficult to grow up with her. However, I'm not sure I agree that those two specific things are entirely her fault.\n\nI think it would be very wise of you to continue avoiding contact with your sister. It's clearly not helpful to either of you. I understand why you're leery of therapy, but if you consider trying it again it might be helpful for you.\n\nNTA, but please - don't talk to Ann again. That can't be good for you. If she has something important to tell you, she can just as easily tell a trusted friend who will relay the message to you if it really *is* important.", "I'm AuADHD.  I have never killed anyone's cat. \n\nNTA", "Info: how did she kill your cat? You said it was bc of doing something she was told not to do 100 times. Sounds like ADHD to me. \n\nBased on the provided info NAH.", "With the history, NTA\n\nHowever, please don't give up on your sister. Whilst you're justified for the hurt she caused and its impact on you, the diagnosis does give some explanation as to the root of her problems.\n\nShe obviously realises what an impact its had on you and feels some kind of remorse otherwise she wouldn't have reached out and want to talk.\n\n\nIf she'd had the right support earlier for her neurodivergence, perhaps the negative impact would have been less and she might have been more pleasant to live with.\n\nThis is all however hypothetical as the past has already occurred, but maybe her wanting to have done better is a start. I'm not saying go back to how things were and stay with your parents, clearly that didn't work, but working out some way to be in each others lives in the future wouldn't be a bad thing?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why is that, do you think? It\u2019s almost like instead of having issues in general, these were targeted events.\n\nAnd, regardless of the spectrum, the diagnosis doesn\u2019t excuse the behavior. At this point, the diagnosis is simply an explanation as to why she may have behaved that way during her youth. Her refusal to own her behavior and her decision to only blame it on her diagnosis is problematic to say the least. She\u2019s not taking ownership of her mistakes and is trying to pawn 100% of her behavior off on her diagnosis. If she was capable of attending school with no intervention(meaning whatever issues experienced at home were magically invisible at school), managed to kill a pet, didn\u2019t sabotage every other family member\u2019s celebrations (notice nowhere does it say mom and dad never got birthdays, graduations, parties, etc.) as well as those at school, I have a really hard time buying that it\u2019s just the ADHD/autism. This is precisely how people with these diagnoses become vilified, and I\u2019m not basing that simply on my own experience.

She\u2019s actively trying to sweep her treatment of OP under the rug because she now believes she has \u201can excuse\u201d. The thing is, no one is obligated to endure crappy treatment, regardless of the reason. If the sister wants to make amends, she has a long way to go, and, even then, she isn\u2019t owed forgiveness.

That was awful and absolutely an act of negligence or recklessness on his part, but there's no way I'd argue it had to be malicious and calculated simply because he was warned before. Additionally, a literal diagnostic criteria for ADHD is difficulty or incapability of following instructions or sticking to an agreed upon plan; this does not mean OP's sister is not at fault for negligence/recklessness, but that negligence/recklessness in ignoring warnings perfectly fit the idea of unmanaged ADHD better than malicious and calculated pet murder do.", "I mean, one, we don't know if its been long enough for her to do therapy, and two, you're kind of putting the cart before the horse if you think the sister hasn't gone to therapy but would have mature revelations about how and when other people would be willing to forgive her.\n\nWhich, again, isn't saying that OP should meet up with her sister or forgive her, but makes the argument that the sister is still is actively ruining OP's life and trying for control seem pretty flawed.", "That would be a reason why sister maybe can\u2019t be blamed for killing the cat, but there\u2019s still the entire rest of the life events that have been ruined to the point that OP had to ask her parents to not celebrate.", "Sister\u2019s actions crushed the cat to death, it\u2019s in the edit.", "And ADHD and autism are highly comorbid with sensory issues that can include problems with proprioception (your awareness of where your body is in space and in relation to other people or objects).

It would be harmful if I said that this absolves people of blame or responsibility, but I obviously don't think that; I just don't think that basically going to the other extreme of \"unmanaged ADHD is not a plausible explanation for negligence\" is a responsible position either, and you're just seeking a different mental health scapegoat to assume a raging disorder here.

It's just that there's a level of carelessness and poor impulse control - you know, the point where it routinely and predictably harms others - where it becomes a person's responsibility to figure out how to mitigate it, not get a diagnosis to absolve them of it\n\nLike, again, I don't think she was having \"mature revelations\" about whether OP would forgive her. it's just that doesn't make rushing to OP with her \"olive branch\" ok, it makes it *the actual problem in microcosm*", "Oh I didn't see it as I read it when it before the edit was posted.", "I just got diagnosed with ADHD a couple years ago and didn't know this. The frequency with which I slam my hip/leg into stationary objects in familiar environments makes a lot more sense now. Thank you!", "That's a spot on description of my kid.", "OP updated their vague description of what happened with another vague description of what happened. There isn't enough information to determine whether it was intentional or not without OP explaining how their sister's actions caused the cat to be crushed.\n\nFor all we know, OP's sister could've knocked something over. Being told to \"be more careful\" a billion times over isn't going to do a thing if you have problems with proprioception, which is fairly common with ADHD.", "I think there's a lot more to this story than op is telling us, if her sister was autistic/adhd growing up with zero help of course she was going to have behavior problems.", "unfortunately it\u2019s the most likely thing i can think of. I have 2 cats and adhd and autism. My heart breaks for op", "No maybe it doesn\u2019t explain crushing a cat but it can explain a lifetime of dysregulated behaviors. It would certainly explain my 13 year olds behaviors that have almost gotten him held back school grades, made taking him out of the house miserable, made any noisy/chaotic event hell if we didn\u2019t have ear muffs or ear phones to drown out the noise and a bunch of other dysregulated behaviors. I just blamed it on his sensory integration and adhd and never thought he could be autistic because wouldn\u2019t he not make eye contact? Wouldn\u2019t he hate hugs? Wouldn\u2019t he flap and do other stimming behaviors? \n\nSo yeah a diagnosis for my child would explain a lot of the behaviors I\u2019ve never experienced with my older two children. Behaviors that impacted my older two children. \n\nHe\u2019s being tested in two months, I just wish I\u2019d thought of it before or a doctor had mentioned it before.", "How do you know that she\u2019s not in therapy? Obviously she is.", "I\u2019m glad to help! Here\u2019s a link that might explain a little more, but there should be a lot of resources if you go looking for them: https://neurodivergentinsights.com/blog/proprioception-inputs", "I don't have any diagnosis but by my teenage years I just stopped paying attention to the bruises from running into things. Sometimes, to this day, people will be all \"OMG, where did you get that terrible bruise on your arm/leg!!?\" and I am like \"huh, will you look at that. Probably hurt when I got it but who the hell knows, I run into everything.\"", "I get so tired of doing that.  It\u2019s even worse when you have arthritis and smack your thumb on something.", "OP is allowed to be distressed about it whether it was intentional or not. But they never did say that it was intentional, they used the word \"accidentally\".", "Why? Why do you think there's a lot more to the story?  Yeah autism and ADHD can easily impact a person's behaviour growing up and not getting the proper help does a huge disservice to the person. But pretending that people with undiagnosed autism and ADHD cannot be assholes regardless of their conditions is kinda dumb. A person can suffer from mental and physical health problems or neurodivergence and still be a dick. I know quite a few people with autism and ADHD that weren't dealt with during their younger years, none of them have ruined every personal event for their siblings or killed their cat. \n\nAnd regardless, whether a person can help that behaviour or not because they have not been given appropriate coping mechanisms does not mean we have to forgive them for all the shitty things they did to you.", "My family used to have two cats. One died at 15, I still remember trying to get her to eat some food in the morning, and coming home to my parents holding her in a shoebox- funeral was later that day. Our other cat was put down at more than 20 because she had horrible arthritis, was very fat, and we were about to move. It\u2019s horrible to think that the cat died, simply because the sister couldn\u2019t get her head around the fact that doing a certain thing was dangerous and it ended with a dead cat\u2026", "adhd and autism have pretty much identical symptoms. that\u2019s why i only recently found out i have autism (i\u2019m 20). yes the teachers and parents and doctors in the sisters life let her down. but the parents also could have stepped in and taught her to do what is right. My step mom will still scream at me to act normal, this is not what i mean. Calm, consistent parenting should have been in place here. I am not blaming you btw, this is just a subject i\u2019m extremely passionate about because of all the ways my own parents fucked it up. Please listen to your son. Don\u2019t force him to be normal, at least pretend to take an interest in special interests instead of shutting them down.", "Honestly, the amount of people that I know that are just utter dickwads because their parents blamed everything on the neurodivergence. Guy where I used to live mad left a r*pe joke about a minor and the staff blamed it on his autism and brushed it aside, it's absolutely maddening, mental health isn't an excuse", "My cat monkey died when I was 7. He had ran away and someone \u201cdidn\u2019t see the collar\u201d and kept him outside until he died. Monkey was an indoor cat. My dad adopted him and his sister Coco with my birth mom who died when I wasn\u2019t even 2. He was in Vietnam when he got the call. 2 days later my birth mom\u2019s mom died. Most traumatic week of my life. I was being antagonized by my substitute teacher all week because untreated Adhd. Ops sister is hateful and cruel. Adhd and autism don\u2019t do that. Somebody who has been taught life has no consequences does.", "Your stepmom shouldn\u2019t be screaming at you to act normal.  I\u2019m sorry it took so long for you to get diagnosed and that you\u2019re stepmom was harsh. Because of my kids sensory disorder I know he already has been set up to fail in a lot of ways and try my hardest to set him up for success at home. My oldest two are out of the house now so it\u2019s a little easier to manage with just one child\u2019s needs I have to balance but it was a lot harder when he was younger and I couldn\u2019t always meet my older children\u2019s needs because the needs of my youngest were more pressing and their behavior so dysregulated. We couldn\u2019t go out and do fun stuff because my youngest would cry and meltdown. He couldn\u2019t help it, you couldn\u2019t parent it out of him, all the parenting skills I\u2019d developed up until his birth flew out the window when he came. It\u2019s constantly like taking an exam that gives you a pass or fail grade before learning the lesson. \n\nI wish you all the best."]}
