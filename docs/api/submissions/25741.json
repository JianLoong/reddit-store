Her diagnosis doesn\u2019t magically fix the trauma she caused. You are under no obligation to mend a relationship with someone who traumatized you.

But it does not mean your experiences are deleted and your entire memories will Change!!! \nAlso, is she expecting you to be comprehensive on everything that may happen AFTER if you get her back in your life, because she has a mental condition? So you need to justify if she ever ruins something important for you again based on that? \nUse this to forgive, and move on with your life knowing that she was not actually aware of what she was doing...

Never call them or message them back without getting more information from different sources first.  Call your parents.  Call other family or family friends. Check google.  Check the social media that people you are concerned about use.  \n\nYou can get information as to not feed into their bullshit.  *She killed your fucking cat.* Now she is spiraling and can't cope after she set you up, you called back in a panic, and replied in anger because she played you.

It is your right to decide to apologize and reconnect or not. If being around her negatively affects your mental health then its probably best to cut ties. \n\nI do have a question though. Like with the incident with your cat. Did your sister forget and leave the door open and your cat ran into traffic or did your sister do something more intentional to murder your cat like feed it some thing it shouldn't eat or kick the cat.", "NTA.  Diagnoses are not excuses, and to be honest ADHD isn't even a particularly good one to try to hide behind for her actions.  It doesn't excuse her behavior at all and I would be done with her too.", "NTA. I've got a younger sister that was first diagnosed bipolar, and then later schizophrenic instead. She sort of refuses to acknowledge the shitty things she did and said and what she still puts us all through when she has episodes (usually cause she stops taking her meds - full blown psychosis with paranoia and voices). I play as nice as I can at holidays but I do not like my sister. I don't need apologies, but I do need acknowledgement and to really see her taking her condition seriously, and she doesn't really do either. I've told my parents similar to you OP (not quite so drastic maybe). I talk to and see my parents all the time because they understood why I needed to be so LC with my sister. My sister causes me incredible anxiety. I find it hard to relax around her, and in bad moods just about everything she says becomes triggering. I'm working on it, for myself mostly, but also for my mom. It's not easy though, when there's decades of resentment and problems to sort through. My parents respect my need and do not keep me informed of her episodes.\n\nYour sister's diagnoses, like my sister's, are not her FAULT, but they are her RESPONSIBILITY. And part of that means acknowledging hurt they have caused even if without their knowledge or direct control. It also means acknowledging that some hurts can't be repaired. \n\nI've set some clear and firm boundaries. I had to make it very, very clear to my parents that I would never forgive my sister if she did something to take attention at my wedding (her favorite is to search for sympathy with litanies of ailments - she's also just kind of obnoxious aside from the actual mental illness), and that I did not want my parents or other close people babysitting her either. I seriously considered not inviting her at all, and she certainly wasn't in my wedding party or invited to get ready with us. My mom had friends of hers who knew the drill ready to step in if she got up to her typical stuff. Aside from 'spraining her ankle' walking into my rehearsal dinner (which I had so clearly predicted that even my mother laughed with me later), she was on her best behavior and I'm grateful for that.\n\nSo, I really do get it OP. Maybe if you're willing to hear your sister make real acknowledgement of the hurt she's caused you, you could let your parents know that. I've told my mother that in response to her \"wanting us all to get along and be close\". She knows my terms, it's in her court now. If you're not willing to do that now, that's ok too. Maybe be open to it in the future if you see real changes from your sister?", "NTA. The diagnoses might explain the behavior, but it doesn't excuse the behavior. We still have to take responsibility for crappy stuff we do in the midst of a mental ill health episode. I've absolutely lost friends when I've been super irritable and paranoid (anti-anxiety meds stopped working after 15 years). Figuring out that I was in the midst of an active episode only explained and helped me be more mindful of such behavior. It did not excuse it.", "NTA at all! Just because she's ADHD and autistic doesn't immediately excuse all the shit she did, feel bad for your parents having to deal with that but you were very respectful with them about what was going on so NTA and well done for getting a character that wore down your mental health out of ur life", "NTA and there was no olive branch all she did was give an explanation to try and excuse her past behavior. A boundary was set that OP didn\u2019t want sister in her life the diagnosis doesn\u2019t change that. The news of sister\u2019s diagnosis should have been conveyed via the parent\u2019s.", "NTA. She TOTALLY thought this would be her get out of jail free card and  you would have to forgive her for all her bad behavior.  It was NOT an olive branch.  If she really thought about YOU, she would have sent a letter or card.\n\nYou are not wrong here and the fact that your parents are blaming you tells us why she thought she would get away with this.", "Autism and ADHD can do a whole ton to how one responds to the world.  But understanding that a thing you've done has hurt someone else is not part of that equation.  I don't blame you for rejecting the \"olive branch\" and thinking it was a \"get out of jail free card\".  That's a very reasonable interpretation.\n\nI think your anger has more to do with how she (and kind of your parents) never really saw things from your perspective.  Maybe when she apologizes and takes some sort of responsibility for her actions, you can (tentatively) let her back into her life.  \n\nBut this diagnosis doesn't seem to be helping her see things from any view but her own - it really sounds to me that she's passing the buck again.\n\nNTA", "To be clear, Ann is not responsible for *other people* bullying you. If her behavior upset other people then that still does not make her at fault for them then choosing to target *you*.\n\nAnd while I'll accept that Ann may be responsible for your cat's death, your comments make it sound less like she killed your cat and more like your cat died while she was home. I understand that you have trouble talking about it, but without more context it's impossible to know... well, to know how much she's really at fault here.\n\nI agree that it sounds like it was very difficult to grow up with her. However, I'm not sure I agree that those two specific things are entirely her fault.\n\nI think it would be very wise of you to continue avoiding contact with your sister. It's clearly not helpful to either of you. I understand why you're leery of therapy, but if you consider trying it again it might be helpful for you.\n\nNTA, but please - don't talk to Ann again. That can't be good for you. If she has something important to tell you, she can just as easily tell a trusted friend who will relay the message to you if it really *is* important.", "I'm AuADHD.  I have never killed anyone's cat. \n\nNTA", "Info: how did she kill your cat? You said it was bc of doing something she was told not to do 100 times. Sounds like ADHD to me. \n\nBased on the provided info NAH.", "With the history, NTA\n\nHowever, please don't give up on your sister. Whilst you're justified for the hurt she caused and its impact on you, the diagnosis does give some explanation as to the root of her problems.\n\nShe obviously realises what an impact its had on you and feels some kind of remorse otherwise she wouldn't have reached out and want to talk.\n\n\nIf she'd had the right support earlier for her neurodivergence, perhaps the negative impact would have been less and she might have been more pleasant to live with.\n\nThis is all however hypothetical as the past has already occurred, but maybe her wanting to have done better is a start. I'm not saying go back to how things were and stay with your parents, clearly that didn't work, but working out some way to be in each others lives in the future wouldn't be a bad thing?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

IS SHE BREATHING?\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve not spoken to her since. My last moments with a woman I loved more than my own mother were marred by her wailing and screaming. My aunt apologized for her like she always did, but she shouldn\u2019t have brought her period. There was no scenario where having her there would not be disruptive. (Plus my grandma was always being tasked with babysitting her for my aunt and uncle to go on vacations WITHOUT HER, and I saw the disdain in her eyes for my cousin\u2019s behavior every time we were at family get togethers)\n\nTl;dr having a mental disorder explains why you want to do the things you do- they do not excuse the behavior or make the damage done by the individual any less painful.", ">They\u2019re mad because I was too harsh under the circumstances and set the olive branch on fire.\n\nWhere in that story was there an olive branch?  I reread it and there was none.  An olive branch is going out and doing something for you to show she cares to apologize for anything.  Like something thoughtful.  Could be like a family photo book of all your important events or something that matters to you.  Coming up yo you and saying, \"you can't be mad anymore, I have a medical diagnosis!\" is not an olive branch, that is a \"look, I have a REASON for doing all those things FOREVER now!\"", "NTA. I have adhd and probably something else. I know many people who have both adhd and autism and they manage to not be complete AHs to everyone around them. She might have adhd and autism...but shes also a complete AH.\n\nThe fact that she doesnt seem to have any remorse for anything she has done (judging by the post alone) says a lot.

We own our behaviour, because it is nobodies responsibility to manage it but ourselves. Yeah, she didn't have the specific resources to cope with her disability, but that doesn't justify it. Nothing will justify it. She knew her actions were wrong, but rather than own her actions she dissolved into tears and victim acts when called on her shit. Hell, she is doing it right now and everyone else is acting like you're responsible when all you did was tell her firmly you weren't interested and you still held her accountable.\n\nAn olive branch is someone making actions to make amends, apologizing for their actions, and recognizing their faults. An olive branch is someone offering something actually genuine to mend fences. All your sister had was an excuse cloaked in the implicit statement that you couldn't really hold her accountable for her actions, which is bullshit.", "I'm going with NTA and while you all have finally gotten an explanation for why life was hard for your sister, it doesn't excuse or justify the hurt, pain, and suffering you went through. It doesn't excuse your parents ineptitude at preventing your sister from ruining your life milestones. It doesn't obligate you to forgive and welcome her back into your life.\n\nA diagnosis is not a freebie to wash her mistakes away and act like everything was just a misunderstanding. Your sister now has a responsibility to understand her diagnosis and how it affects the people in her life. She'll need lots of therapy sessisons to understand why she behaves this way and how to rewire her brain to react differently so she doesn't hurt the people around her. She has to eventually realize that she could put in years of therapy and become a genuinely good person, but that will *never* erase the pain, suffering and trauma that she put others through, including you.\n\nYour absolute rejection of her is completely justified. I would be hesitant to welcome someone like her back into my life too, especially when she just got a diagnosis and has done very little therapy to address her issues. It honestly makes me wonder if you are approaching another life milestone that she wants to \"insert\" herself into.\n\nI won't pressure you to forgive her or welcome her into your life with open arms. You may find that her actions are simply unforgiveable, even after years of trying to forgive her. But those are you decisions to make and only you'll know if and when you're ready to forgive. I encourage you to make the decision that will bring you peace of mind and stability in your life.", "NTA. It\u2019s great that your sister finally has an explanation for her behavior but you\u2019re under zero obligation to forgive her or want her in your life. Your own mental health should be your priority and while I\u2019m sure your sister isn\u2019t handling your reaction well, it\u2019s not your responsibility to coddle her either.

She needs to accept that.

Understands what she did wrong\n\n2. Understands *why* it was wrong\n\n3. Accepts that she caused that pain deliberately \n\n4. She is genuinely regretful and is willing to put in the effort necessary to make things right.\n\nIn short: *Forgiveness requires atonement.*", "INFO: Where do you live that doctors didn't quickly diagnose her, given the symptoms you described?

She doesn\u2019t get a get out of jail free passing because she found out she had autism and ADHD after killing your cat and ruining tons of your major life events.

The delayed diagnosis isn't that odd.", "I have a opinion of forgiveness.\n\nForgiveness is for the person that was harmed.  Forgiving means that you let go of the pain, and the anger so you are not longer controlled by it.  It does NOT mean you forget about what occurred or even allow the people who harmed you back in your life.", "Honestly, I don\u2019t think it does. I have the same diagnosis as do many people I know personally, including from support groups. While the combo presents differently for each individual, I\u2019ve never heard of such a diagnosis leading to murdering pets or ruining every single major event in OP\u2019s life. I would hazard a guess that her sister also has a raging personality disorder as that would make a lot more sense. Had it just been adhd and autism, there\u2019s no reason that therapy and medication wouldn\u2019t have worked at any point during the entirety of her childhood. Those conditions aren\u2019t even remotely rare, so unless they only hired quacks to treat their child, it seems unlikely a mental health professional would miss the very obvious signs of ADHD at a minimum. I\u2019m more than happy to be wrong; however, I would be very surprised if that\u2019s all that\u2019s going on here. \n\nOP, you\u2019re doing the right thing keeping your distance. She\u2019s already taking the \u201cmy autism made me do it\u201d route to avoid taking responsibility for her actions. I have to ask, did she ruin everyone else\u2019s events, and break their things or did she save that for you? NTA, and tell your parents that if a \u201cno\u201d is sending her spiraling this hard, you don\u2019t want to see what an actual crisis would look like.

I was in therapy when I got diagnosed and my therapist did not even have a basic understanding of autism-informed treatment, so of course she wouldn\u2019t have picked it up.

For the most part, unless someone requires high support in all areas of life, (which she clearly doesn\u2019t as she attended school with no IEP) there are ways to learn to interact with others, manage emotions, and be parented in a more constructive manner. \n\nI\u2019m well aware that the \u201cmale brain\u201d model of autism has led to under diagnosis, particularly as someone (AFAB) diagnosed in adulthood myself. I understand how my diagnosis contributed to problems from interacting with my peers, studying, the ability to function in a classroom, share emotions, break down large tasks into smaller steps, etc. I also am able to see where it likely contributed to problems, but I take full responsibility for my actions in those moments. Autism didn\u2019t make me do it, just made that pattern of behavior more likely. \n\nFurthermore, it certainly didn\u2019t mean that I was unable to learn better patterns of coping and that was with zero childhood intervention. This girl saw therapists individually and with her family for YEARS to no avail. Finally, taking responsibility for her actions would allow her to understand why her sister has no desire for a relationship, yet she blames it on her diagnosis. It\u2019s obvious nothing has changed and any wrongdoing in the future will be dismissed, particularly by the parents. It\u2019s a common misconception that people with autism lack empathy, but that\u2019s simply not true. I struggle with emotional empathy but have excellent cognitive empathy.

That doesn't she isn't at fault to a large degree and doesn't mean OP needs to forgive her, at all, but I also find it harder to agree with the \"consequences of her actions, torch that olive branch\" takes; this can just be a \"don't re-establish the relationship\" situation.", "None of this is suggested by the post at all.
