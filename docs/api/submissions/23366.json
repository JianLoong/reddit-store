My parents are my parents, period. When I was little I used to have some interest in my biological parents but by the time I was 18, I really didn't. I want to be clear my parents have always been nothing but supportive and even encouraged me to reach out to my bio mom. They never tried to hide I was adopted or stop me from exploring that, and offered many times to fly me to my birth country (they're also from there, we just moved) to meet her, I just haven't ever had the interest. Also, my bio mom was not a teenager when she had me, she was 27, so it wasn't like she was forced by her parents to put me up for adoption or anything, and I wasn't stolen or trafficked or any of the other tragic horror stories you hear. \n\nI'm 26 now. A few years ago my parents got an email from a social worker in my birth country that the person who was potentially my bio dad wanted a DNA test. I said yes but when he tried to reach out after paternity was confirmed I only talked to him for a few months before dropping it. During this time I did a group video call with both of them, and quite frankly I just felt uncomfortable and awkward. My bio mom was very eager to get to know me and compare me to her and I just didn't like it. Neither of them asked after my parents, or my childhood, or tried to offer any explanations to me. They both asked to come to my wedding. \n\nI realized that quite frankly I just don't read want them in my life. I'm not a very social person generally, I have a small circle and I like that. I am currently back in my home country with my parents and husband visiting family (adoptive family, who I consider family). I didn't realize that one of my bio mom's neices followed me on Instagram from a stealth account. She messaged me and said my bio mom knows I am here and would really love to see me. I responded I won't have time this trip, and she said I was being mean and breaking my bio mom's heart and that it doesn't make sense why I don't want to know her. I said I'm sorry but I don't know you from Adam and blocked her. \n\nMy mother said that she can't tell me what to do, but her heart does go out to my bio mom and she'd also be sad in her shoes. My husband says I should to whatever will bring me peace, which for me would be not seeing her. \n\nETA: I just wanted to make it clear my mom wasn't offering unsolicited advice, I asked her opinion and she said she can't tell me what to do can empathize with my biological mother. She wasn't pushing me either way which has been her stance since she realized I genuinely have no desire to. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1690577860, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15c8z3u/aita_for_not_wanting_to_visit_my_biological_mother/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Glad to see you have such a supportive adoptive family! They sound very kind, maybe a little bit to a fault. Bio family's behavior has from your description been a little excessive and at points invasive, especially with the stealth insta. The fact is, they gave up the chance to be parents and have any connection to you when they gave you up for adoption. You have every right to your feelings and not wanting to be in contact with them.", "NTA\n\n You need to do what is best for you. That woman wasn't there during all the hard times, and if you don't want her in your good, that's okay. If you don't feel comfortable with erh in your life, its okay. Its your life. Do what makes you happy and be around people who make you happy.", "NTA, just because she gave birth to you does not mean she needs and/or is permitted to be a part of your life. If you're not comfortable with it that's okay, you're an adult and your allowed to be as distant as you'd like. You can cut them off cold turkey or say something along the lines of \"While I am glad we got to talk I am not really interested in furthering a relationship\" and then do as you see fit. (Also you should block cousin stealth account if you haven't already)", "NTA.  I find it very suspect that during the limited contact you've had with them, they have shown no interest in you as a person (i.e., childhood experiences, adoptive family, etc.).  And your bio mom wants to compare you to her?  Really????  I can't help but think they have a different motive for wanting to see and have contact with you.  But that might just be me.", "NTA!! You don't owe Birth giver anything, she is not your mother in any way. DNA doesn't make family. You need to tell both BIOS that you want no contact.", "NAH. Bio mom isn't wrong for wanting to know you and you're not wrong for not wanting to.", "NTA. This sounds like your bio parents care only about their needs. For one, they never actually asked about your current family or your childhood and seemed to be interested only in your life to compare it to theirs. Second, when they asked to see you, as opposed to leaving the invitation open and waiting to see when (and if) you would be ready, they laid a guilt trip on you and pressured you into saying \"yes.\"", "NTA.\n\nYou have your family.  Those folks are your biology and you are not required to include them in your life.  You tried it and it didn't fit for you.  It's sad for them but not for you.  They need to accept it and move on.  Trying to guilt you and manipulate you will only build more of a wall.  It is possible that in time you may change your mind but that is up to you.  Right now, they should respect your boundary.", "NTA. There\u2019s a difference between being related and being family. You don\u2019t owe them anything, including an explanation. Surround yourself with those you love and have a great time at your wedding.", "NTA. Sometimes whatever brings you peace is the best course of action to take and in your case is not to see your bio mom.", "NTA\n\nShe gave you up and she may have valid reasons for that. You have valid reasons for not wanting to get to know her. You are not an emotional support animal. If she is sad that is sadly tough. She made her choice she doesn't get to make demands on you. She isn't your parent you don't owe her anything.\n\nI think you need to consider this isn't about you, it's about her. If it was actually about you she would have been interested in finding out anything about your childhood and how things were for you.\n\nQuestion are potentially seen as more affluent because of the country you moved to? You sure this is not a long con with the hope of getting some financial assistance.", "NTA.  You've had no connection with the bio parents your entire life.  You owe them nothing.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nIt is your choice.  Your biological parents must accept that.", "NTA\n\nYour bio parents gave you up; so they lose all rights to everything, especially now that you're an adult.  It's nice that you know of them and that they want contact, but you don't.  And I don't blame you; by being adopted, you're raised by completely different people.  Sure you may have some similarities (i.e. maybe you both played volleyball or have similar interests), but family for you is whom you chose, not who made you.\n\nIt also sounds like they want you in their lives for very selfish reasons; something about their desires to meet you and their intentions don't sit right with me either.", "NTA.\nThat woman just gave birth to you, but it's not your mother. You were the one abandoned by your own birth mother, so I can't understand why everyone is talking as if that woman is the real victim.\nShe made her choice 26 yrs ago, and even if I wont judge her for that, she knew what she was doing and the consequences of her own actions.\nYou still tried to know them, but see that you dont feel anything toward them, and they are stranger.\nAlso, they didnt even brother to ask about your life and your parents. \n\nYou didnt have any say when that woman decided to give you up for adoption, but now you are the only one that has the right to choose.\nSo, do what's best for you, and ONLY for you.\nSo be strong and dont let other people guilt trip you.\n\nGood luck OP!", "NTA. I'm adopted. I speak to 1 of my 3 siblings and 1 of my bio parents because the others are incarcerated or crazy.

Giving birth means she\u2019s a mother, but not a mom.\n\nThe fact she wants to see you now, and hasn\u2019t attempted to reach out sooner probably means she feels guilty, wants to fulfill an emptiness, or wants something else from you. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe her that gratification.", "NTA.

Life is complicated; it was 100% the right decision but it\u2019s also extremely personal and may not be something they feel comfortable talking about.\n\nyou should be honest with them that you felt they were moving too fast, if you havent already.    \nDont hold what the niece did against them unless you know they put her up to it.\n\nAnd remember that later in life there is benefit to knowing your biological family\u2019s medical history.", "NTA! And frankly your adoptive mom can feel for the bio mom all she wants but should bite her tongue on offering advice. Your husband is right. Do what you want. Once bio parents put a kid up for adoption they loose all claims, moral, legal and any other way you want to look at it, to your affections, attention or even recognition of their existence. You owe no one in this situation anything--except doing whats best for you. Good luck.", "YTA. Using an alt because I'm sure I'm going to get downvoted for this. \n\nWould it really be that hard for you to meet with the woman who gave birth to you for half an hour to make her happy? You do realize that without her you would not be on earth to write this post? You do realize she's probably thought about you every day since you were born? Have you considered she didn't ask about your childhood or adoptive family because she could not bring herself to do so? And now the child she's thought about every day for the past two decades doesn't even want to see her for a second. \n\nThe morality of adoption is also very iffy you should look into that. If your a different race from you parents its even worse because they took away your whole culture from you. You should do some introspection and maybe therapy and see if the anger you clearly hold at your mother is not displaced anger at your adoptive parents for this. You are trying to make out your adoptive parents to be saints but at the end of the day they took a child away from its mother for their own selfish reasons. They likely spent thousands of dollars to do so which they could have given to your mother instead to help her keep you. They treated you like a commodity like when people buy a dog.", "NTA. You need to do what feels right for you at this point in time. However, I strongly suggest you leave the communications door open as you may feel differently as you get older. One suggestion, perhaps, is to ask to write letters as opposed to visits. In that manner, they will have to respond to your questions in writing. Read the responses or tuck them aside for later.", "NTA. Your bio mom made a decision as an adult. And decisions have consequences, i.e., you no longer being her child.", "NTA", "Thank you. I blocked the stealth account and went through and blocked any other accounts where I couldn't see who the person was.", "I think that they both just got to an age where they didn't have any kids except for me and are now regretting that, which quite frankly I view as not my problem. I also forgot to say in the op that my bio mom also tried to insinuate that my parents had moved to a different country because they wanted distance from her which really pissed me off. My parents sacrificed everything to move and make a better life because my home country is incredibly dangerous and impoverished.", "We definitely have more money, but I don't think she's struggling. She's in the upper middle class in my home country. She lives in a very nice area, much nicer than the place my [adoptive] aunt's and uncles and cousins live, and I know she has a generator and wifi which most people can't afford here.", "Thanks. I just want to be clear my mom said she can't tell me what to do. She just said she has empathy for bio mom because I asked for her opinion. She wasn't saying anything unsolicited.", "That's just, . . Mostly bullshit. You have no idea any of the circumstances of OP's adoption, and are making a damn lot of assumptions. I have a step sister that was given up for adoption, and if you asked her, my stepmom, or anyone else actually involved, every single one of them would tell you it was the best possible thing. Hell, go to a group home and ask those kids that have been floating around in the system for years whether they'd like to be adopted, or, you know, keep moving the few things they own from place to place in trash bags.", "I did post this to get judgment, but if you could not compare me to a dog or a refrigerator that would be awesome, thanks!", "OP you are correct, them not having any other kids is not your problem.  The comments that bio mom have made toward your parents are out of line.  Sounds like they want you to ditch your parents and go back with them to be a \"family.\"  You're definitely NTA.  If you don't want them in your life, block them and go NC.", "I may be reading too much into this but do you think they might also be contacting you for financial reasons? They are getting old and don't have other children to support them in their old age, and you are likely well off in their standard if your home country is impoverished, given things like exchange rate, etc.", "Your bio mom feels guilty and rather than take responsibility,  she's blaming others.  NTA. Do what is best for you.", "The existence of group homes and the terrible state of our foster care system doesn't mean adoption isn't immoral. Something being bad doesn't mean that the alternative is good. \n\nThe evidence for that is right here in this post. OP hates the people who gave birth to her. They were taken away from their country and their culture when they were a baby. They completely attached to two random people who bought them like they were a dog or a fridge. If OPs adoptive parents had really wanted what was best for them then they could have donated the enormous amount of $$$ they spent on purchasing OP to OP's mom and allowed them to stay together as a family. \n\nWhen I buy a fridge I don't care that I got that specific fridge like it's exact production number and batch code I just care about getting a specific fridge. OPs parents wouldn't have cared any more about her then anyone else if OP wasn't the kid they got. OPs bio mom always will because their biologically hers. That's what you take away from a child by adopting them and also as I said before a whole culture OP was ripped from. \n\nA specific good outcome you have experience with does not make the whole enterprise okay. It's like that fox news guy recently who tried to say that slavery was good because slaves were taught skills. Just because of the existence of a slave who may have later benefitted from something they learned while enslaved doesn't make slavery a good thing it's a terrible thing.", "NTA It's your heart and you have decided what to do with it. Bio's may want to meet but if that ship has sailed, so be it.", "You are not required to have a relationship with your biological parents. NTA. \n\nWhile it may have been traumatizing to give you up, and whatever unfortunate circumstances that lead to that decision, you were also affected by being adopted and they seem to have very little interest in how and in you. \nYour biological parents are probably just trying to find themselves in you when they do the comparison game. Do what brings you comfort and closure. \nAdoptees are not required to forgive or have a relationship with bio parents.", "NTA you do what you want, and the fact that these people seem to want to skip over the \"get to know you\" to just outright claiming you... someone need a kidney or a rich foreign family member? Seems sketchy and VERY entitled.", "NTA this is 100% your decision. Don't let anyone try to guilt you into changing your mind.", "It is your life.  It is YOUR decision.\n\nThere is no right or wrong.  It is really up to you.\n\nI think you should try to get health ' genetic history from your both your bio parents, but that does not mean a relationship.\n\nIt sounds like having a \"relationship\" owed make you uncomfortable.\n\nNTA", "Did you even read the post? Her parents, the ones that actually wanted her, are from the same country. \n\nShe owes nothing to the parents that decided that they didn't want her when she was born.

It's a fine tribute to your \"real\" parents, the ones who raised you.", "You have wonderful, kind parents to be encouraging of you building a relationship with your bio relatives, but that's up to you. \n\nEveryone's adoption journey goes differently. Some want a relationship with the bio relatives, and some don't. I feel like your parents loved you so much you don't need to connect to your bio relatives and that's okay. \n\nAs an adult it is your choice as to how much contact you want with them. You may want to keep a line open for health concerns, but the rest is up to you. NTA", "Not wanting to know your bio mom DOES make sense.
