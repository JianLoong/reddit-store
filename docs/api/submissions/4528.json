This happened last week. If anything is confusing or if you need other info let me know.\n\nI\u2019m 32f and my friend \u201cDana\u201d (30f) wanted our friend group to go to her house to hang out, have some drinks, chat and just have a good time. We were all down for it. Our friend group is \u201cAmy\u201d 31f (who is part of this) then \u201cMark\u201d 33m (Amy\u2019s husband) 37m, & 25f. Dana bought a chihuahua about 2 months ago named \u201cChica\u201d. It\u2019s an adult and she said it had \u201cissues\u201d like separation anxiety and she had to put her on a specific feeding schedule but was over all a good dog. She said NOTHING about any aggressive behavior. I\u2019d like to mention that I love animals big and small. So I was looking forward to meeting Chica. I get to her house a little later and everyone\u2019s there already hanging out so I join in. About 15 minutes after I get there Dana brings the dog out and introduces her like the monkey does with simba in the Lion King, which we all laughed at and thought was funny. AS SOON AS SHE SETS THE DOG DOWN it runs over to Amy and starts biting the sh** out of her leg completely latched onto her, growling. She was the 1st person at the end of the couch. We all jumped up like oh fu**! Amy is screaming and crying trying to push Chica off her and Mark gets up and tries to pull the dog off her. Meanwhile the whole time this is happening Dana is SCREAMING \u201cDON\u2019T HURT MY BABY WHAT ARE YOU DOING LEAVE HER ALONE\u201d after mark got the dog off her he\u2019s holding her in the air saying \u201ctake it!\u201d So Dana grabs her and runs back in her room and slams the door. We all tried to calm Amy down but she wasn\u2019t having it, which I completely understand. She was wearing jeans but she had blood run down her leg when she pulled her pant leg up. So they left and the rest of us are sitting there like holy crap wth just happened. Dana comes out of her bedroom and nonchalantly asks where Amy and Mark went. We told her they left (we were in awe with how casual she was acting) then she said well I calmed Chica down and i\u2019m letting her back out. I said \u201cyep i\u2019m out of here.\u201d She started screaming at me saying if I left then say goodbye to our friendship and a bunch of other sh**. I told her \u201cI\u2019M WEARING SHORTS if your dog bites me I might drop kick it into the oblivion and I\u2019m not about that life.\u201d (I had a couple drinks by then lol) wasn\u2019t trying to be funny when I said that but our friends started laughing and Dana got even more mad and said get TF out! So I did. \nI haven\u2019t stopped getting messages from her telling me I ruined the rest of the party because our other friends left directly after me. I don\u2019t know. She has said in the text messages that her dog has bitten someone else before but \u201cit wasn\u2019t a big deal\u201d completely unprovoked.

And I hope Amy is making sure Dana covers any medical expenses.", "NTA: her dog is feral. Honestly I hate chihuahuas in general so I'm slightly biased against the dog and it's owner here, but according to op, the FIRST THING this dog did after being released was ATTACK someone. If this was a bigger dog animal control would have been called. But people think this behavior is acceptable in small dogs when it isn't. If I went to someone's house and found out they have an aggressive animal that they fully intend to let loose on guests, I'd leave too. NTA.", "NTA - Dana should have had the dog on a short lead when guests are over until she know how the dog will react. The fact that there\u2019s a prior bite makes Dana liable.", "To state the supremely obvious if this is the full story then no you\u2019re NTA.  The fuzzball bit someone the second someone took their hands off of it and this is apparently not the first time.  In most cases legally that means the little beast would be put down.  The party being over is the barest of minimums and for your friend to resent that is the height of stupidity.  Drop her and mock her relentlessly.", "Chihuahuas are little bastards (yes I know there are the occasional non-bastardy ones so shout out to the Not All Chihuahuas crowd), they are near the top of the most aggressive dog breeds lists year after year. People think it's not a big deal because they're little. Those people are wrong. You are NTA and your friend needs a reality check. Her vicious little cutie pie is gonna get taken away and put down to check it for rabies if it keeps biting--much as I dislike 99% of all Chihuahuas I've ever met, I hate to see animals get killed for behaviors that can be trained out of them with time and effort and persistence. Your friend needs to take the little bastard to training and work like hell to make it stop biting, and in the meantime, of freaking COURSE no one wants to be around it!", "NTA you didn't cause everyone to leave mini cujo caused everyone to leave, I hope the dog's owner has to pay your friends medical bills, and I hope the dog is up on its shots because going through a rabies series sucks.", "NTA. And not the dog's fault. It is obviously a rescue and may have been mistreated or at least not trained. The fact that your friend knew it had bitung tendencies opens her up to liability. She ruined her own party by having her dog chase everyone away", "NTA. Fear biters are often the worst ones. Poor dog needs help but your friend is endangering her friends and the dog with this irresponsible behavior.", "NTA, party was pretty much over after Amy got bit anyway. It would have been super awkward even if the dog didn't come back out.", "Amy had to go to the hospital to get stitches. I tried to add this in my post but I don\u2019t know how.", "Nta. I would never go to her house again and would seriously reevaluate this friendship.", "NTA\n\nLike, there are a million reasons a dog can turn aggressive that may not necessarily be the owner's fault, but I really freaking hate when owners downplay the behavior of aggressive dogs just because the dog is tiny.  She's only had this dog a short while, and she may not have predicted that the dog would act this way in front of strangers, but it was the owner's responsibility to remove the dog from the situation the moment she realized the dog was not handling it well.  It was extremely AH of her to try and re-integrate the dog with the guests after such an incident.\n\nYour friend is probably really surprised that this happened, doesn't know how to psychologically process that her dog has serious problems, and is taking it out on you.  It is not your fault that other people decided to leave after you did, and Dana ruined her own party by putting her guests' safety at risk.", "It didn\u2019t give me an option to put in why I might be the AH. So I\u2019ll put it in here\nI might be the AH because I messed up the rest of her party by leaving and causing everyone else to leave because I wasn\u2019t understanding to her dog\u2019s needs.", "NTA. I'm a dog owner.\nYou were very right to separate yourself from an aggressive dog and an irresponsible dog owner. Dana is doing Chica a disservice. Chica should be trained to be calm around strangers and she should be properly socialised with humans. Dana should have showed Chica her behaviour wasn't ok, and that she's safe with her friend group.\n\nYou, very rightly, didn't want to get attacked by a vicious chihuahua and instead of making the situation worse for the dog and yourself by staying and being nervous around her, you left.\nYou did right by both yourself and Chica.\n\nDana shouldn't have such a nervous dog, since she obviously can't handle her.\n\nEditted typo", "I'm going to preface this by saying I have this same chihuahua. I usually don't have friends over because he tries to bite everyone he doesn't know and he's very unpredictable. I had a gathering of friends recently and I gave him a bit of Trazodone and even with that he was still very perky I did let him out and he managed to control himself but at the same time I have no expectations of other people to put up with that. I always explain to people coming over that he is not friendly and that he tries to bite and I either keep him away from the group or I manage his behavior as best I can. He has certain movements that he reacts to so I usually grab him if someone is about to stand up or walk out the door. As long as everyone is sitting he is usually fine. I think it is ridiculous that your friend would expect other people to tolerate being bitten by her dog and not even apologize to her friend who was injured. That is not a friend in my opinion. Anyway you are nta, I don't think that you ruined the party, I think everybody left because the dog owner doesn't know how to behave.", "NTA at all. The only AH here is Dana because she\u2019s seriously neglecting her dog\u2019s obvious behavioral problems/needs. I have a dog who I absolutely adore to pieces. But she is very resource guardy, including with me. It\u2019s not bad with other adults, but she gets super bothered when I give any attention to or play with young kids like my niece or nephews. It\u2019s on me to a) know my dog well enough to notice that she\u2019s stressed out by a situation and b) to intervene and either correct, redirect, or remove her from it if it\u2019s too much BEFORE anyone can get hurt. Your friend sounds like an irresponsible and neglectful owner who just wants to perks of dog ownership without any of the responsibility, and I hope Amy (and the rest of the friends) hold her accountable for her behavior.", "NTA \n\nBut what? She was getting her attack dog out again when everyone was drinking? \n\nGood idea to leave!", "NTA obviously, you did the right thing. Chihuahuas are grumpy little beasts, but given their small size, many people underestimate them. But I guess your friends won't do that anymore. The real problem is Dana, who is so enthralled by her new baby that she didn't even realize what happened in her living room. You do well to stay away until she takes a bath of reality, maybe the hospital bill will open her eyes, I hope it arrives and that the couple doesn't mind delivering it, it's only right that she pays for it. I hope Amy recovers soon and without scars.", "I\u2019ve never seen a chihuahua bite produce blood, much less through jeans. Are you sure that dog is a chihuahua? Did someone file down its teeth?", "NTA. I\u2019m probably biased as I detest chihuahuas, every one I\u2019ve ever met has been an absolute yapping nightmare demon with anyone but it\u2019s ONE person, but I\u2019d be pressing charges if the thing had bitten me. Amy is being far too nice, and you leaving the house was just sensible.", "NTA-I personally am deathly afraid of chihuahuas (feel free to laugh lol) after being almost bitten by two different Chihuahuas belonging to two different people out of nowhere.\n\nTheir owners seem completely oblivious to the little furry devils, but those adorable mini-Terminators can be relentless if they don't like you lol.\n\nI'd definitely check on your friend Amy to see if she's OK and to encourage her to seek medical care and to see if she needs rabies' shots or stitches. Dana sounds very irresponsible with her behavior, and the immediate issue at hand is making sure that your friend will hopefully recover before trying to ascertain what is going on with Dana if you feel obligated to (like if she's oblivious, having mental health issues, etc.)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not to mention the questionable overbreeding of them which can lead to neurological problems with the breed. Chihuahuas and other small dogs are so misunderstood thanks to bad owners when they can be so lovable when properly trained and socialized.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add that people also tend to violate small dogs\u2019 boundaries in often.

That dont means biting is fne or to ask apology frm sum1 who got bitten by her dog. \n\nEdit: i wonder what if chica get hit by a car, and is Dana gonna apologize to car owner???\nNTA", "Jumping on the top comment to add -- If Chica has not had her rabies vaccination then she must get tested for the disease and Amy will likely have to get the series of anti-rabies shots. You MUST NOT wait to see if symptoms appear in Amy because by then it IS too late to treat and IS fatal.", "Just so you know, even if Amy doesn't report this, many times hospitals and doctors will report bites to animal control. It's a public health risk and a way to track rhings like rabies. So your friend may have a visit from animal control even if she was not directly reported by Amy.\n\nNTA btw. Your friend will get her dog killed if she doesn't figure out real quick how to curb that unacceptable aggression. Maybe if you tell her exactly how animals are tested for rabies she will wise up... but probably not.", "The only reason chihuahua\u2019s are labeled as \u2018aggressive\u2019 is because they\u2019re the smallest dog breed and are constantly on guard. They\u2019re stepped on, kicked, tossed around like a toy and constantly have their boundaries stomped. I 100% agree that it\u2019s on the owners fault for not properly training her animal and making slow introductions, but not all chihuahuas are going to take your ankle out. All the ones I\u2019ve had are incredibly sweet and well-adjusted. NTA", "You didn't cause everyone else to leave. I guarantee you they were already making that decision as soon as Dana said she'd be bringing Chica back out. You just said it out loud first.", "There is nothing you could have done for that dog in that moment. Her dog's needs would not have been solved by you staying at the party, and it's extremely rude to keep partying after someone has to leave for a legitimate medical emergency *like getting attacked by the host's dog.*", "Laws vary on rabies\u2026.\nIn my state, doctors are required to report any dog/cat bites. A vaccinated animal must be checked 3 times in a 10 day period for any neurological issues. The report then goes to the state.. An unvaccinated animal needs to be quarantined at a shelter for a certain amount of time. Off the top of my head. I can\u2019t remember how long. \nThe only sure fire way to test for rabies is to euthanize Chica, and send in brain tissue to a state lab. (If in the US)", "Also rabies vaccinations are extremely expensive (and painful) so she should definitely file a claim with her insurance", "Size doesn't matter much when something is chewing on your leg. I occasionally have previously abused pets and my scariest was a 700g/1.5lb ferret jill. Find 95% of ferrets sweet and those who aren't tend to be badly socialised or abused. But she spent six months charging and swarming me to go for eyes and throat before settling. She was actually a lovely girl once settled. Had her for 5 years but could not trust her with strangers. Vet had a special protocol for her.\nI feel sorry for the dog but your friend has to take her needs seriously. And that includes not letting a possibly territorial dog overwhelmed or let her bite guests. Nothing wrong with keeping everyone safe by having her in a bedroom.", "Which puts you one up on the actual owner, who isn't taking the dog's needs seriously at all.", "Actually, they are not painful at all. The IV was worse.", "Cost depends on location. In cities where stray animals are common (e.g. in Asia, South America) you can often get them very cheap. The government hospital near me does the shots themselves for free, with a 10 rupee (0.12 USD) charge for paperwork and the private clinics do it for approx. 350 per shot (4 USD).", "Doubtful, unless you can contact the rescue society and prove that she's violating her adoption contract by mishandling/putting it at risk by refusing to accept that she has a reactive dog and acting to keep people safe from it.", "My sister was four years old, and the neighbor's dog came onto my grandfather's property, grabbed her by the back of her neck, dragged her down and started shaking her violently.  My grandfather didn't give the owner time to have the dog trained, if you catch my meaning.  He wasn't too worried about the dog's issues. The owner got sued for hospital bills.", "True, I literally worship my cats as godesses.", "NTA, but please ask Amy to reconsider and to report Dana and the dog to animal control, especially if she is the second person that dog has bitten.\n\nWhen I was a child, a neighbor's dog pretty savagely attacked me when I went to pet it (I was not warned not to) biting my face. I came out of it with pretty minor scarring, tha kfully, but a pretty gnarly fear of small dogs.\n\nNeighbor told us that had never happened before, so we only asked that the dog be quarantined, nothing more.\n\nNeighbor lied. I was the second person it bit. It came home from quarantine and attacked another neighbor the next day. \n\nIf the dog is attacking people unprovoked, it needs to be dealt with.", "\"I'm sorry that I did not report you to the police for having a viscous animal, I should have done so but I mistakenly valued our friendship instead. If you'd like me to make up for that transgression, I will happily tell the police all about how your dog attacked me unprovoked to the point that I needed to visit the ER.\"", "You are absolutely right. I have a chihuahua and I trained it like I would train any other dog and did 3 mile walks every day with him. He never barks or growls and would never bite as I've never allowed that behavior.", "My kid asked a neighbor if he could pet her (tiny) dog. She just yoinked him up by his leash/harness to hold him so my kid could pat his head. No wonder those dogs have issues, they can\u2019t trust they won\u2019t be just suddenly dangling midair!", "Agree, if the dog had gone after a baby in a carrier, she could have easily killed it.\n\nDog bites are no joke, they are dirty wounds and punctures can easily get infected and cause a ton of complications. Yes, dogs can be trained, but knowingly housing a dog that attacks at first sight is asking for trouble.", "Vicious. Viscous means something very different.", "Some cats are viscous."]}
