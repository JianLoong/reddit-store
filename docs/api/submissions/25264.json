Not being accommodated at your wedding is a major red flag for what's to come. NTA\n\nTo be real with you, I'd go with NTA even if it wasn't your own wedding. Just because a disability isn't visible, doesn't mean it isn't real and choosing not to attend an event where you aren't accommodated is totally acceptable.", "NTA\n\nI hate to say this, as I never want to be the one to cast doubt on other's relationships, but might this be a huge red flag as to how your relationship is going to progress?  If I was getting married to a woman, whom I supposedly love above all else, who was on the autism spectrum and had very real issues with certain things, I would bend over backwards to make sure I accommodated her needs and would tailor the wedding around her.\n\nThis is so easy to accomplish, as well.  You just need to make sure you work with the venue to make sure you have a place to escape to if needed.  Hopefully your reception is being held in the same location as your room (if not, have you considered having the reception in the ballroom of the hotel at which you'll be staying afterwards) so you can just sneak out to your room now and then for some downtime.  Even if that's not the case, you should be able to work with the venue to make sure you have a little \"bride space\" you can use for some quiet and isolation when necessary.\n\nAlso, if you have medical needs and prescriptions you need to take at midnight, then that has to take precedence over anything else.  You also said you had no problem with everyone else hanging around to party even after you left... that seems like such a reasonable solution that I can't imagine anyone would have a problem with it.\n\nThe only place I would say you might need to reconsider is the breaking of the glasses.  This could have symbolic importance to him and I can see why he would want you there.  But, even then, there are compromises... ask him if he alone could break the glasses, but you'll be happy to stand beside him.  If the sound of it bothers you, have the venue wrap the glasses in an extra layer of towels to help deaden the sound.  There are compromises that can be made here that will make everyone happy.\n\nBut, going back to my original point, my biggest concern here is your groom to be should already know that you are on the spectrum and loves you and wants to marry you in spite of that... as is said in the ceremony, \"in sickness and in health.\"  The fact that he knows you have these issues, wants to marry you in spite of those issues, but isn't willing to make some concessions so you can enjoy your wedding day seems like a **big** problem.  If he's not willing to make some small (and having seen a lot of horrible brides in my time) and reasonable accommodations for you now, what will he be unwilling to do for you going forward?\n\nThis might be a good time for you and your future husband to sit down, alone (keep your future mother-in-law out of it for now) and discuss this issue.  Let him know that while these seem like little things to him, they are a huge issue for you and your condition... and if he isn't willing to work with you on these little things, you have to question how he will deal with future issues that may come up due to your autism.  Things like keeping up a home, raising kids, etc., are difficult as it is with two healthy people... the challenges you will both face doing the same while dealing with your autism will be even greater.\n\nBest to lay all those cards on the table now and work through those red flags then be surprised down the line...", "\u201cEDIT: I\u2019m the bride\u201d?! \ud83d\ude33\n\nUmmm\u2026that makes a HUGE difference to the story, don\u2019t ya think?

This makes any parties and large gatherings difficult to me, due to noise, presence of crowds and disruption of my usual schedule. So ever since the wedding date was scheduled, I was skeptical about whether or not I actually wanted to attend the reception. Obviously I will have my earplugs in starting with the ceremony, but still I have requested some accommodations for me. I don't want to be present for traditional breaking of toast glasses, I asked if there would be a quiet space, and I told my fiance that I'd be leaving the reception at midnight the latest, as I have to take my medicines and go sleep. My fiance and (even more) his family say that it's a lot to expect, that the reception can't cater to me exclusively and that I can't make my fiance leave the reception so early (I'm not; he would be free to stay there without me). I eventually got fed up and said that I have no desire to stay at a reception that I don't feel good at, and if there is no way to get out of the \"overstimulation zone\" as I called it, I might as well never enter it in first place.

So it's symbolic of Jewish history and an analogy for recognizing precious things around us (like the love of two people for each other) and how they must be cared for or they can easily be broken.  Here's some more information:  \n[https://www.chabad.org/library/article\\_cdo/aid/542288/jewish/Why-Break-a-Glass-at-a-Wedding.htm](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/542288/jewish/Why-Break-a-Glass-at-a-Wedding.htm)\n\n  \nA quick Google search will pull up even more.  If your husband or family are not members of the Jewish faith, then there's probably another symbolic reason behind the breaking of the glasses that is somewhat similar.  Again, a quick Google search could probably help you understand that a bit better.", "Thanks for clarifying! Very important edit to the situation. \n\nNext I want to ask, how soon is the wedding, and how long has this reception been planned? When did you start making your concerns known?\n\nIt sounds basically like your fianc\u00e9 especially and his family should be accommodating you, as your compromises do not sound like very much.\n\nDoes your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family know you\u2019re autistic?", "People get weird about weddings. Be honest, tell him \"You're my future life partner, and your response to our wedding planning really has let me down. I know the wedding is a big deal and your family is putting on a lot of pressure, but of anyone in the world I'd expect empathy from you, my ride or die\".\n\nDon't mince about with words, be honest with your feelings and lay it out there. Give him the chance to say \"oh shit, i got wrapped up by family pressure over this and was a total jerk, im so sorry!\" Of course, he might also say \"You're being selfish, get over it\", at which point I would personally put off the wedding.", "Ok, but it would be very, very strange to hold a reception with the bride leaving.\nThat is what the reception is for, congratulating the newly weds.\n\nCould cutting down the guestlist to only the closets relatives (parents, siblings and no children) help?", "This is them showing you who they are. Believe them!", "I also didn't make the connection that it was your wedding and reception. So I do understand a greater necessity to have the accommodations you need. I would say changing to a different venue that could meet your needs would be best, but I'm sure it's too late for that.\n\nAs for the breaking ceremony, if you know that's too much, then that should be it, end of story. It may be a disappointment to your fiance and his family, but adjusting to your needs is something he is signing up for.", "Where does it say that?", "If breaking glass is so important to him, couldn\u2019t he do it with his family and friends? You could go somewhere to take a break and there has to be somewhere for you to get away. If not, the venue they\u2019ve chosen isn\u2019t a good fit and another one needs to be selected. This is your wedding too. His mother should not be doing the planning without your input. \n\nI think you need to sit down alone with your fianc\u00e9. Let him know what you\u2019re willing to deal with and what you\u2019re not. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re being unreasonable.", "You're going to have to push back to get your way. It's YOUR wedding and you should be comfortable so don't back down Honestly, if your fiance doesn't have your back on this, I don't think he'll make a very good husband. Also it's perfectly normal, in my experience, for the bride and groom to depart before the very end of the reception.", "I think you\u2019ve already compromised by consenting to the reception in the first place. Now it is time for your fianc\u00e9 and his family to compromise. You can certainly send guests away at midnight. If they can leave at dawn, they can leave at midnight. If that cannot be done, book rooms for them at a hotel. NTA.", "Your fianc\u00e9s mother is being ridiculous.\n\nEvery wedding I\u2019ve ever been to, the married couple left before most of the guests.  They had the hardest day after all and were exhausted.  And presumably they wanted to go off and enjoy being married somewhere else in peace, whether for a honeymoon or a nap.", "About me and my fiance. (Which is why there's a reception at all - I was all behind simply having a dinner with the people we want at the ceremony, but my fiance wants something more traditional)", "Ok I should have read all of it! My bad!", "So her enjoyment means mkre than his", "You need to put your foot down, it's also YOUR wedding not only his and his family. If he wants a dinner with his family he can do it an other day", "I am sorry he is such an inconsiderate asshole.  He should be putting you first.  Doesn\u2019t bode well for your marriage.", "You're in Europa, right? I am guessing Greece or Italy, glass breaking is done there too. (I'm European too). You can get easily married at the town hall of your town or village too. I did it, we just had a small party afterwards and it was fun and no stress. Talk to him and tell him how you feel, it might be a good solution.", "My son is on the spectrum, so I\u2019m a bit biased. You absolutely deserve to have accommodations in place. But yeah, where I come from, the bride generally gets final say on literally everything. You\u2019re the star of the show. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "Even if they weren't the bride, is it so bad to ask for a quiet chair in the coat check and to be warned about loud events like breaking glass so they can step out to maintain their composure? And we had friends leave at like 9pm because their alarm app alerted them to something going on at home and they had to go check it out. I wasn't offended. People need to leave when they need to leave.", "Even if they weren't the bride, is it so bad to ask for a quiet chair in the coat check and to be warned about loud events like breaking glass so they can step out to maintain their composure?

My fiance wants it, but he doesn't want it alone. So I told him that he does it alone or not at all as I'm not doing that.", "Not Jewish. All I was told me is \"that's how it's done\" and my first language search didn't get much info either.\n\nI probably won't have to deal with his mother trying to decide how to raise children. One needs children for that.", "Why can't she just go sit in a car during that time?", "It's in October, the planning started in May (at least that's when we scheduled the wedding date), I have voiced my concerns even before that. My first idea was simply dining the guests but my fiance wants something more traditional and it's his special day no less than mine. They know I'm on the spectrum, but I'm not sure if they understand what it means.", "I'm not sure. The guest list is 30 adult humans long (mostly family). I agreed to a traditional reception, but I would have to leave at midnight latest. We would be congratulated enough and the party could go on.", "Sadly venues that have more space away from action don't do receptions for fewer than a certain (much higher than our guest list) number of people. I was all for just a dinner without a traditional reception, but my fiance wants a reception, and it's his wedding too.", "I initially didn't make myself clear. I edited the post.", "I'm perfectly okay with him staying and enjoying himself without me if he wants to as well. But he says it would be awkward if he stayed without me.", ">i dont think hell make a good husband \n\nYeah his the worst for *checks notes* wanting to enjoy his own wedding", "I retract my statement I didn\u2019t read all of it! I hope you both can find an acceptable compromise.", "Yup, you have no clue about autism....", "He wants the dance and stuff.", "Poland actually. (Elsewhere in these comments someone cleared it to me that it's a Jewish tradition, so it makes sense - Poland used to have a lot of Jewish population until Germans came in 1939). I told him. I initially wanted to dine the guests and that's it. But my fiance wants to dance at his wedding reception so I told him my requirements.", "Because his being crusifed for wanting to do stuff he will enjoy and his own dam wedding", "I changed my judgment. I didnt realize that youre the bride. Sorry for my misunderstanding. Do what\u2019s best for you. NTA.", "I don\u2019t mean this in a harsh way, but why are you marrying someone that has such a disregard for your comfort and enjoyment?", "... that might be a thing she will get into too and pressure her soon to give her grandkids....", "Hmm I saw in your other reply that it\u2019s your mother in law mostly planning the wedding. I can see how that would complicate matters. \n\nIs this a Jewish wedding? I\u2019ve briefly searched the internet, and it kind of sounds like this is a moment specifically between husband and wife because of its symbolism. I can see where the problem is here too, if (understandably so, because of overstimulation) you do not wish to be present. \n\nI\u2019d like to suggest a compromise, such as crushing only one glass, between you two, at an earlier point in the day. Or at a quiet point in the ceremony, specifically without music etc. Or perhaps in a private moment between you two. But I can\u2019t say I understand the tradition much at all or how people think it should be done. \n\nAnyway, my sympathies OP.", "Oh. That's a completely different story then. Your wedding, your rules. Try and make compromises with your fiance on the stuff that bothers you, but you're the bride, your say goes.", "How can he enjoy his wedding reception if its making his new spouse really uncomfortable?  Would he enjoy it too if part of the wedding was guests whacking his bride with sticks at whim until she bruised?\n\nThe limits OP asked for are fine.  And common for many larger weddings I\u2019ve been to.  A quiet closet somewhere for bride/groom to decompress (or Eat Something without people interrupting), not shattering a glass, and leaving the after wedding party at midnight after a very long and stressful day.", "I am autistic babes\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\n\nI just dont expect other to cater to **my** disability my issues and comforts are mime to manage not the worlds", "Ah sorry, I thought it wasn't a Jewish ceremony. I hope that you will find a way!", "Nobody is being crusified. OP is not asking groom to not do anything, just to be able to leave the reception area when she wants to.", "Usually he took great care of my comfort and enjoyment. It surprised me for the wedding.", "She already has a grandkid (my fiance's niece). And as long as I take my meds I shouldn't have children.", "She is trying to manage them....", "It's not, but since so many Jews lived in Poland for so long, some traditions seeped through.", "And to not have a big meal or to do the traditional smashing a glass at this points it better than the separate", "I\u2019m worried that he will become more controlling once you\u2019re married, especially if this has already been an issue in the past. Take care of yourself, OP!"]}
