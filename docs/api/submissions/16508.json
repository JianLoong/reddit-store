If I missed or if the drink spilled, then the customer was probably going to blame me, and I would get in trouble with DoorDash.  On top of that, there are two options when a customer orders from DoorDash: \"hand it to me\" and \"leave at my door.\"  I'm not required to \"throw it on the roof.\"\n\nSo I called DoorDash support while I was driving to the house and explained the situation.  The support agent said that the instructions were \"ridiculous\" and instructed me to leave the order at the house's front door.  When I got to the address and got out of my car, two tween/teen girls were sitting on the roof and immediately told me to throw the order up to them.  I said that DoorDash told me not to do that and told me to leave it at the door instead.  They became very pushy and borderline aggressive, saying, \"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE NO!!!  Our parents are sleeping in the living room and the dog will go crazy.\"  I said I could leave it at the garage door instead of the front door, and they were like, \"No just throw it up here.\"  I reiterated that I was specifically told by DoorDash not to do that, and they kept arguing with me by repeatedly saying that, \"DoorDash is never going to know.\"  Eventually I sat the order down on the pavement beneath them, took a picture to prove that I had delivered it, and started to walk away.  They yelled after me, \"Now you can throw it up.\"  I was tired of them pressuring me, so yelled back, \"NO!\"  They didn't say anything else.\n\nAs I was leaving, I called DoorDash support again because I was afraid that they were going to leave a bad review and/or lie that I never delivered the food.  The support agent assured me that I would be protected since I had a paper trail with the first support agent and a picture of the food.  Anyway, I feel kind of bad about this because I usually try to follow customers' instructions even when they're inconvenient as long as they're reasonable.  I'm also a large man with a deep voice (\"booming\" according to my girlfriend) and have been told that I'm intimidating, and the fact that they immediately shut up once I raised my voice makes me feel kind of guilty.  My girlfriend was actually waiting in the car the entire time (she accompanies me sometimes while I'm delivering), and she said I shouldn't feel bad because they were \"brats\" who \"needed to be put in their place.\"  I'm still worried that I was too mean though.

From the sound of it, they were sneaking in  food without the knowledge of their parents, now the parents will know (which they might get in a lot of trouble for) or they have to forfeit the food. After taking the pic and maybe asking them to confirm receipt, if there is an option for them to do that from their phone, you could have tried to throw it up to them. Or if you don't have belief in your own athletic capability, at least explain that reason to them.

I cant believe I finally have a reason to share!! \n\nI had a delivery.  Probably 1am-ish, pretty far out into the country. If im remembering right it was Wendy's, not Taco Bell but my instructions were weird. Something like, come to the fourth second floor window over or some such.... To be honest I was a lil creeped out because there wasnt any other houses around for a good few miles, here I am up this mile long driveway 15mins from town & all creeping thru somebodys yard at one in the damn morning.... Sounds like shit you hear on the news before you get shot right? \n\nI had every intention of just delivering to the usual on the porch til I got there & it was two young girls, maybe 10-12ish? Theyre leaning outta their window waving at me & start lowering this homemade rope thing (Swear, theyd legit old school tied a damn sheet to an Easter bucket!) & trying *real* hard to like half whisper/yell? Telling me how theyve worked it all out & their parents are asleep & please dont wake them. They were *SO* loud! Lmao It was hilarious! I stood there while they pulled up their two bags (didnt have enough room for it all at once) & then again for their drinks which was fun watching them tryna \"balance\" it pulling it up to keep them from spilling. Super cute cuz after they got everything up & Im waving good bye they even lowered it again with my handful of change for a tip lol. Theyd tipped a decent amount in the app already but something about the change made me just crack up\n\nThe best part? As Im getting back in my car, I see the parents watching from the front door smiling & waving at me giggling to each other & (Im assuming) the parents even increased my tip even more. One of the weirdest/most wholesome deliveries I ever had while I was a driver & it still makes me smile thinking how they thought they got one over one their parents that night", "I thought this too.

I know there a lot of households that doesn't approve specific foods. A lot of parents who are so adamant the kids should only do as per their wish or is grounded, verbally or physically abused. So I am considering if the kids went to that extreme to order out late at night, they must have some good reason. Reason why they couldn't ask their \"parents\" to order food for them. Whatever it is, they are just kids and asking for food they paid. Delivery guy didn't throw cause \"he didn't have belief in his athletic prowess\". But that reason was never communicated. Just that he is not gonna do that. They were never given a chance to figure out another way. That's an asshole move in my mind.

Parents are not approving of being hungry and wanting food at 12.30 AM. Cause hunger has specified hours? \n\nSo instead of letting them know and getting in trouble for being hungry, they order food which they pay to have delivered and for same reason ask to not drop at door since they cannot collect it from there. I agree legally the delivery guy is not responsible for anything more. But essentially, the kids paid but still was bereft of food they paid for and left hungry, or get the food but face wrath of parents who might confiscate the said food and punish them. For wanting food. In which world is being punished for wanting food okay?\n\nLights out time and times for eating is socially imposed norms. Hunger a basic necessity.

They were likely also not supposed to be on the goddamn roof in the first place. Vast majority of children that age living in abusive households won\u2019t have access to the money to order a delivery either & if the food had been damaged then the driver would be the one to get told off. They may have even wanted the food to get spoiled so they could get a free replacement &/or full refund. You need to calm down a bit lol.", "Maybe this is the case.
