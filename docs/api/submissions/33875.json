You disagreed on details like whether to buy insurance, but you still went through with the half and half deal. It turns out that the group decision to not get insurance. You stayed with the deal even after you knew that the insurance wasn't purchased. You stayed with the 50/50 deal and, oops, it turns out you were right, it would have been wise to buy insurance. Still, you stayed with the 50/50 brother deal. (You didn't rent your own car, you used this one.), so you should pay for half of the foolish group decision to not get insurance. If you find the driver that hit you, you will get half of what they sue you for.\n\nYou drove half the car, you should pay half the damages.", "NTA\n\n\u201cI told you we should have bought the insurance, because then this would have all been taken care of. But you said no; your insurance would handle any problems. So now that is what is happening.\u201d\n\nSounds like they didn\u2019t report the accident to their insurance company bc it would affect their premiums, so they are paying out of pocket. That\u2019s called being \u201cself insured\u201d, which is what happens when you don\u2019t buy rental insurance.\n\nAnd no; the paperwork says who is legally responsible. And the paperwork says that   \n> A: BIL is responsible as the listed driver  \n> B: BIL actively chose the risk of not buying rental insurance. And now BIL is on the hook for the damages he was hoping would not happen, but did.\n\nBasically, your BIL gambled and lost, and he wants you to cover his losses. He put everything on Black (against your advice), and the wheel of fortune came up Red. \n\nThis is not your problem.\n\nHe argued AGAINST buying rental insurance. If he had listened to you, what you both paid in insurance would be MUCH LESS than the repair cost.", "NTA - This is WHY you had that argument, and this is why you rescinded your offer to sign the rental agreement and didn't sign off as a driver of the vehicle.  \n\n\nSo crazy to think that there were consequences to your brother in law's actions, and he was fine taking the risk but not paying in full when his gamble failed. \n\nThey probably also (correctly) know that your wife is a pushover, so they figure they can have their cake and eat it too. GLWT.", "Is he asking for 1/2 of his deductible or 1/2 the cost of the damages?  Not only do you have to pay for the repairs for the car, you also have to pay for any lost income while the car was being repaired.  If paying out of pocket, this will NOT be cheap / affordable.\n\nNTA, and I agree with you on principle.  However, some relationships are worth a couple hundred to keep the peace.", "NTA\n\nYour BIL gambled and lost.  You didn't cause the damage. Your BIL refused the insurance that would've covered this insisting that his would.  \n\nNot actually your problem and you weren't even a listed driver so this really is all on the BIL.  He needs to use the insurance he said would cover it... or pay up.\n\nI suspect he would've been fine if the car had bigger damage or was written off but a bumper is easily fixable but his premium would go up for the claim that is on the minor side.  Still not your problem", "You are totally in the right here, NTA as this was exactly why you wanted insurance, however you DID still rent the car with him.  Personally, I would say you are really frustrated that you didn't just get your own car, then you wouldn't have had to deal with all of this. But not let it go so easily.  Ask how negotiations are going with his insurance, ask to see what their communications was, why they are not covering, ask to see what BiL's coverage was, etc.  And OK, give the money but make it a 'big deal' so BIL doesn't pull this crap again.  Also, now you have some leverage...arguments like this will go in your favour from now on.", "Info:  Did you have any direct involvement with the damage to the car?", "NTA but this is a situation where both of you can be right, it sounds like. Your wife doesn't seem to be saying that you are required to pay this, or that you are wrong when you say this is exactly the situation you were thinking about when you declined to be a driver. She's saying - this is an important enough relationship and a big enough problem that I think we should just eat the cost and do it, even though you're right. So I guess the question is whether you think that's true, or why she's saying that, or how you weigh the relationship vs your perspective on this.", "NTA. If you didn't drive the vehicle and you didn't park the vehicle where it was hit then there's no reason why you should be responsible for the damage. His opportunity to get you to split any damages that were done was decided when he wouldn't pay for the extra insurance and have you as a driver.", "How much? Is it worth breaking family bonds. Plus you have this to rub them up the wrong way forever. Do as you wife says and make sure you patronise the hell out of BIL - I did say this would happen. We wouldn\u2019t be paying this if we had take out the $50 insurance. Have as much gloating as you possibly can.", "NTA\n\nfirst you need to tell your wife NO! You and her will not be paying for it.\n\n2 Remind your BIL, the reason you would not add your name as a driver was because he refused to get rental insurance. He only has himself to blame and this is his responsibility.\n\nMaybe he will learn this very valuable lesson, when hiring a car you always get the insurance as well.\n\nThankfully in the UK, you have to take the insurance, it is mandatory.", "INFO NEEDED:  Did you have anything to do with the damage to the vehicle? \n\nIf it was hit by a third party then why wasn\u2019t a police report filed?", "Nope. Nada. Not happening.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nI wouldn't pay either. You told him you wanted insurance and he declined. You didn't even put your name on the rental so only he drove. He said his own insurance would cover it. This is on him and him alone. \n\nI get that your wife doesn't want this to cause a rift but it's not on you two. The gall of this guy to ask for 50% when he was against insurance and sure his would cover it.", "NTA\n\nThis is literally why you wanted the insurance!", "NTA\n\nA simple, \u201cI didn\u2019t have the money to pay for repairs out of pocket which is why I was opting for the insurance.\u201d should do it.", "You would be TA if not for the fact that your BIL did not want rental insurance and shut-down your idea.  Otherwise you should be sharing the risk and sharing all costs related to the rental.  NTA.", "BIL should check if his credit card, used for the rental, covers this. Many major credit cards used to come with this insurance.", "NTA. Hopefully he had collision coverage on his own insurance policy. They will pay for the damages less his deductible if he does", "NTA - he refused to buy insurance because his would cover it- so why isn\u2019t his covering it? \n\nDon\u2019t give him any money. You could be TA and remind him this is why you wanted to buy insurance in the first place\u2026 I\u2019d be hard pressed not to do that \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "NTA - \"Remember that part where I wanted insurance and you refused because it's a waste of money and your insurance will cover damages? Well, where's that insurance coverage because I won't be giving you anymore than what it would have costed for my part of the original rental insurance.\"", "NTA. \"I thought your insurance would cover any damages? Surely there's nothing for me to pay?\"\n\nBewildered confusion is the way to go here.", "NTA. \n\nHell no. This is exactly why you wanted the insurance and exactly why you didn\u2019t add yourself as a driver when he refused.", "NTA but your wife is showing you exactly where you rank in comparison to her brother and his wife.", "NTA he said his insurance would cover the charges and you weren't a driver on the car. he played a stupid game etc etc", "I\u2019m confused. Didn\u2019t he say that his credit card would cover the damage?", "NTA but I also agree with your wife. It's not worth a family fight over this, truly. Send them half the cost and then get your own car with insurance next time.", "NTA you wanted him to get the insurance, he declined, and you legally weren't a driver on the car.\n\nWhy isn't his regular insurance dealing with it?", "INFO: Have you at least offered 50% of the insurance you wanted to pay, and 50% the deductible you would have been charged?\n\nYTA if you didn't do that. If both families still had use of the car, you're on the hook for *something*, just not necessarily the cost of uninsured repairs.\n\nI also think you need confirmation of what BIL's own insurance ends up covering, and you should be paying 50% of the deductible cost there instead of the rental insurance you wanted to buy. If BIL's insurance doesn't cover the repair cost, I don't think you are obliged to pay for his stupidity. But you still should pay for your share of the rental insurance would have cost you.", "NTA. You are 100% right, as you were when you wanted to pay for the insurance in the first place. BIL said his insurance would cover it, so let his insurance cover it. Try not to say \"I told you so\" where they can hear it. \n\nAll that said, if this is going to fracture the relationship and it's an amount you can tolerate, maybe keeping the peace and maintaining the relationships for your family's sake is more important than being right.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Pay him half the cost of the rental insurance. He's liable for the rest.", "Show this Post to your wife", "NTA. You literally warned them about this possibility.", "NTA. You predicted it would happen, you wanted to buy insurance for exactly this event, he refused, and you wisely took your name off the paperwork. Rarely is there such a tailor-made opportunity to irrefutably demonstrate your superior foresight to your in laws.", "NTA\n\nYou wanted the insurance. BIL said no and that his insurance would cover it. Sounds like he should have listened to you.", "NTA. You weren\u2019t on the vehicle lease. Also your BIL said his insurance would cover anything. \n\nI\u2019d ask what the deductible is and offer half of that since his insurance should be covering it.", "NTA, he declined the sensible suggestion of full insurance so that it was cheaper, now it is not cheaper and he wants you to pay for it.\n\nwas probably third party on his insurance which is why he needs to cover the damage", "Half the insurance cost even", "This is 100% on the BIL. Original plan was that they would split the cost of the rental. They disagreed about paying for insurance, BIL claimed that his insurance would cover it so they split the cost without insurance. BIL assumed responsibility for the insurance and any damages in order to save a few dollars short term. In other words, he chose to gamble when OP wanted to play it safe. OP is not responsible for BIL's bad bet.", "The deal he agreed to was that BIL's insurance would cover it.  So that's what needs to happen.  Else, BIL can fuck off.", "> You stayed with the deal even after you knew that the insurance wasn't purchased\n\nunder the assumption that the other guy was telling the truth when he said his insurance would cover any damages. but then it turns out that was a lie, so why should OP be held to the \"original deal\" when the other guy isn't being held to the original deal of his insurance covering the repairs??", "found the BIL", "THIS! OP definitely NTA. BIL definitely gambles and he FAFO", "It could be that his insurance paid for repairs, but not for loss of use while the car was on the shop (this is typical).\n\nThis is why on our personal rentals, we always get the expensive insurance at the rental place (and it hurts me) since no policies we have will cover that money the rental company might charge in the claim for loss of revenue while the car is being repaired.  That could cost more than the damage itself. \n\nI would remind bro in law that he declined and took that risk, not me.", "lmao this is exactly what my comment said. i even used the \"have their cake and eat it too\" metaphor. \n\nthe absolute nerve of this guy to ask for 1/2. what a tool.", "Most major credit cards cover insurance on rentals and isn\u2019t a credit card mandatory?", "Yes this exactly...I want to know how BIL responds when you say this.  HOw can he justify asking you to pay when he fought you tooth and nail on insurance coverage??", "He paid for half the rental which covered his week use of the car. Any damages incurred falls on the BIL as he said his insurance would cover it.", "this is peak pettiness and i love it, but i think it would just make things harder on the wife and thats not fair to her.", "They disagreed, but OP went along with the no-insurance result. OP drove the car. If OP thought/thinks that no insurance was a deal breaker, he should have left the deal when he had a chance. (i.e. gotten their own car). Alternantly, nothing kept the OP from paying for the insurance no matter what brother said. A mirror of the BIL's position of unilaterally deciding no insurance. The original deal was \"split the cost\", the intermediate decisions like choose which car company, insurance or not, didn't change that original deal \"spliit the cost\". Had there been no collision, the OP would have been happy to benefit from the financial gains that came from assuming the risk of no insurance. If the OP was willing to accept the benefit of the risk, they also need to accept the downside of that came with that risk.", "Exactly- BIL will need to pay for the damages upfront but then his credit card will reimburse for those charges (though or can take a while). He will get his money back eventually", "The original deal was \"split the cost\". OP should stick with that.", "this\n\ni found this out when my last car got totaled. it really sucks, since my insurance paid for up to $100/day for a rental but wouldnt allow any of that money to go towards the rental insurance. but the horror stories ive read about loss of use... \n\njust not worth the risk. ive never been lucky.", "<3", "Different rules in different countries. My credit card doesn't cover any sort of rental insurance.", "OP did not say anything about driving the car. he said that they \"shared\" it. he was not added as a driver for the car, and OP is clearly not a moron so i think it is safe to say that he did not drive the vehicle. he utilized the car as a passenger.\n\nOP was not on the rental contract **at all**. he has no responsibility here. BIL knew damned well why OP didn't want to be on that contract, and he knew damned well that he would be the sole responsible party for any damages. thats how legally binding contracts work. \n\nBIL agreed to the terms of the rental contract (evidenced by their signature). OP agreed to compensate BIL for allow him and his wife to ride along in their rental (evidenced by the payment). at no point did OP agree to take responsibility for any damages to the car. \n\ncant believe i even wasted my time spelling that out for you", "Na dude, he specifically said his insurance would pay for damages. OP specifically mentioned the cost of damages and not wanting to pay for them, and was assured that he wouldn't have to pay them because the other guys insurance would cover it. He never agreed to split that cost.", "Ahh fair enough.  Thanks for the insight.", "I always get rental coverage on my auto policy (to be fair, I'm fully insured all the way to collision level). That way, if there is an incident I'm only out my deductible (which, again to be fair, I always keep at $500).", "My auto policy has a $200 deductible for replacing windshields, but when I got a cracked windshield on a rental car, my credit card insurance covered the full amount."]}
