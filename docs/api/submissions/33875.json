You disagreed on details like whether to buy insurance, but you still went through with the half and half deal. It turns out that the group decision to not get insurance. You stayed with the deal even after you knew that the insurance wasn't purchased. You stayed with the 50/50 deal and, oops, it turns out you were right, it would have been wise to buy insurance. Still, you stayed with the 50/50 brother deal. (You didn't rent your own car, you used this one.), so you should pay for half of the foolish group decision to not get insurance. If you find the driver that hit you, you will get half of what they sue you for.\n\nYou drove half the car, you should pay half the damages.", "NTA\n\n\u201cI told you we should have bought the insurance, because then this would have all been taken care of. But you said no; your insurance would handle any problems. So now that is what is happening.\u201d\n\nSounds like they didn\u2019t report the accident to their insurance company bc it would affect their premiums, so they are paying out of pocket. That\u2019s called being \u201cself insured\u201d, which is what happens when you don\u2019t buy rental insurance.\n\nAnd no; the paperwork says who is legally responsible. And the paperwork says that   \n> A: BIL is responsible as the listed driver  \n> B: BIL actively chose the risk of not buying rental insurance. And now BIL is on the hook for the damages he was hoping would not happen, but did.\n\nBasically, your BIL gambled and lost, and he wants you to cover his losses. He put everything on Black (against your advice), and the wheel of fortune came up Red. \n\nThis is not your problem.\n\nHe argued AGAINST buying rental insurance. If he had listened to you, what you both paid in insurance would be MUCH LESS than the repair cost.", "NTA - This is WHY you had that argument, and this is why you rescinded your offer to sign the rental agreement and didn't sign off as a driver of the vehicle.  \n\n\nSo crazy to think that there were consequences to your brother in law's actions, and he was fine taking the risk but not paying in full when his gamble failed. \n\nThey probably also (correctly) know that your wife is a pushover, so they figure they can have their cake and eat it too. GLWT.", "Is he asking for 1/2 of his deductible or 1/2 the cost of the damages?  Not only do you have to pay for the repairs for the car, you also have to pay for any lost income while the car was being repaired.

However, some relationships are worth a couple hundred to keep the peace.", "NTA\n\nYour BIL gambled and lost.  You didn't cause the damage. Your BIL refused the insurance that would've covered this insisting that his would.  \n\nNot actually your problem and you weren't even a listed driver so this really is all on the BIL.  He needs to use the insurance he said would cover it... or pay up.\n\nI suspect he would've been fine if the car had bigger damage or was written off but a bumper is easily fixable but his premium would go up for the claim that is on the minor side.  Still not your problem", "You are totally in the right here, NTA as this was exactly why you wanted insurance, however you DID still rent the car with him.  Personally, I would say you are really frustrated that you didn't just get your own car, then you wouldn't have had to deal with all of this. But not let it go so easily.  Ask how negotiations are going with his insurance, ask to see what their communications was, why they are not covering, ask to see what BiL's coverage was, etc.  And OK, give the money but make it a 'big deal' so BIL doesn't pull this crap again.  Also, now you have some leverage...arguments like this will go in your favour from now on.", "Info:  Did you have any direct involvement with the damage to the car?", "NTA but this is a situation where both of you can be right, it sounds like. Your wife doesn't seem to be saying that you are required to pay this, or that you are wrong when you say this is exactly the situation you were thinking about when you declined to be a driver. She's saying - this is an important enough relationship and a big enough problem that I think we should just eat the cost and do it, even though you're right. So I guess the question is whether you think that's true, or why she's saying that, or how you weigh the relationship vs your perspective on this.", "NTA. If you didn't drive the vehicle and you didn't park the vehicle where it was hit then there's no reason why you should be responsible for the damage.

Plus you have this to rub them up the wrong way forever. Do as you wife says and make sure you patronise the hell out of BIL - I did say this would happen.

You and her will not be paying for it.\n\n2 Remind your BIL, the reason you would not add your name as a driver was because he refused to get rental insurance. He only has himself to blame and this is his responsibility.\n\nMaybe he will learn this very valuable lesson, when hiring a car you always get the insurance as well.\n\nThankfully in the UK, you have to take the insurance, it is mandatory.", "INFO NEEDED:  Did you have anything to do with the damage to the vehicle? \n\nIf it was hit by a third party then why wasn\u2019t a police report filed?", "Nope. Nada. Not happening.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nI wouldn't pay either. You told him you wanted insurance and he declined. You didn't even put your name on the rental so only he drove.

If both families still benefited from use of the car, you're on the hook for *something*, just not necessarily the cost of uninsured repairs.\n\nI also think you need confirmation of what BIL's own insurance ends up covering, and you should be paying 50% of the deductible cost there instead of the rental insurance you wanted to buy. \n\nIf BIL's insurance doesn't cover the repair cost, I don't think you are obliged to pay for his stupidity. But you still should pay for your share of the rental insurance would have cost you.", "NTA. You are 100% right, as you were when you wanted to pay for the insurance in the first place.
