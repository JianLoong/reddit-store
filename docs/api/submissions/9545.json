As long as baby is clean, isn\u2019t too thin, and well dressed they can\u2019t intervene even if she\u2019s only fed fast food and the parents are idiots.

There is a good possibility that they will have a bad relationship with their parents even after they become adults themselves and you know that they will want to escape as soon as possible. If they choose to go no contact for their own safety/mental health there is a possibility that you will loose them too. Imagine resenting your own family (people they may one day grow close to/rely on) for not only allowing abuse but also encouraging it through compliance. That would hurt, when they are adults they will look back and see the absence of any substantial attempts on your part to ensure they would be safe and taken care of (court, fighting for custody or getting somebody else to take custody). They may not see it when they are young, they might rely on you, trust you and grow close to you because their genetic parents are unable to but when they look back they will see your inaction.\n\nYou are right. It's not your job to care for them but their own parents are clearly unable to. They need to be allowed to be children and I can guarantee you that they will be forced to grow up real fast with parents like that.\n\nI understand that in the end you really don't have to do anything, you may even be unable to but please, try to look out for them even if only a little bit because they will need it if they are going to grow up with parents like that.\n\nGood luck, and I hope that whatever the outcome is it's a good one. :)", "So long as guys who stealth remove condoms so they can bare back get prosecuted as well."]}
