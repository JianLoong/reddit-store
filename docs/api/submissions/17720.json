Even though you're a stay-at-home mom, that doesn't mean you're the only one with parental responsibilities. The idea of letting your partner sleep while you take care of the baby at night so he's not driving drowsy is a fine concept, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have to do anything ever at night time. And the fact that it was a night where he didn't have to drive the next day is the icing on the cake. \n\nTaking a shower for the first time in several days while there's another adult around is not a selfish act or weaponizing your baby, it's basic human hygiene that you shouldn't have to apologize for. Tell your partner it's time to start being a parent.", "NTA and he\u2019s a massive asshole for his response. Absolutely 100% UNACCEPTABLE even I\u2019d you had been doing it out of spite, which clearly was not the case.", "NTA. This is not the way a person should speak to their partner. Is he often like this?", "NTA i would much rather take a 6 hour commute over being alone 24/7 with 2 toddlers and a baby. Even if they\u2019re miraculously all asleep at the same time you\u2019re probably too exhausted at that point as well to shower and your sleep takes priority. You seem like a good mom to sacrifice your needs for your kids, but when your partner is actually home he needs to step up, and should never speak to you that way. Don\u2019t have anymore kids with this guy, and I\u2019d look into getting some help with the kids because he clearly won\u2019t", "NTA. Your partner sounds abusive, I'm sorry. And the fact that he won't even try to soothe his own child? Eck.", "No, you are NTA for assuming it would be ok to let the baby wake up your partner because you desperately needed a shower. You are not a robot, you are a human being who needs basic hygiene and self-care. You were not selfish, vindictive, unsupportive, or using the baby as a weapon. You were just trying to take care of yourself after a long and hard week. Your partner was the AH for being livid, cursing at you, refusing to help with the baby, and dismissing your needs. He is also the baby\u2019s parent and he should be able to comfort and soothe him without \u201ctits\u201d. He should have been more understanding and supportive of you, and he should have apologized for his outburst.", "NTA. I bet he got perfect, long sleep time Wed and Thurs nights away while you were doing 100% of childcare and couldn't even get a shower for yourself. You've given him way too much of a break on care duties if he doesn't even know how to pick up his baby to soothe it (or thinks it's all about sticking food in the baby's mouth).", "NTA, you both are parents! Him working does not excuse him from all parental duties! The hours he works equal the hours you take care of the kids! So evening and weekends are a shared responsibility between you two!\n\nDid he expect you to just not shower at all? And even if you did intend to care fore the baby, how were you suppised to get to them from the shower fast enough to not wake ur husband?\n\nYou better talk to him and put him in his place, or find a job yourself and make him feel first hand how much care is still left after the 9-5 hours?!", "NTA, and that is simply an unacceptable way for your partner to speak to you.  There\u2019s also no comparing the exhaustion of taking care of 3 kids 24/7 with being a little worn out after driving for a few hours (I\u2019m also a parent and a 3 hour drive alone is like a vacation!). You need a break sometimes too, and your partner needs to step up and be a parent sometimes.", "NTA. To those who said that she could have found time to shower during those 3 days clearly do not understand the unpredictability of parenthood. And even if all 3 kids happened to be asleep at the same time, there are so many things that normally take priority over a shower that also needs to get done (like cleaning bottles, prepping food, laundry, eating something or sleep) You don\u2019t know how much time you actually have until one of them wakes up or needs you, and you want to be able to get to them asap. If you were in the shower how would you hear them, or get to them if they needed you? Having another adult in the house during that time is the safest option for the kids and there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with assuming your husband could handle soothing a baby for 15 mins until you were done. He is just as much responsible for those kids as you are, and he needs to help you prioritize yourself every once in a while (especially since you always do that for him).", "NTA - you are both parents and he needs to step up. I'm currently breastfeeding my 5 month old, if I was showering and he woke, my husband would soothe him, he wouldn't complain, he wouldn't be bothered about losing sleep, he'd do what a parent should do.\n\nYou need to have a think about if you want this for your future, his inability to parent is the issue. Working is not an excuse to not parent - EVER.", "NTA. Just a general inquiry is that a time the baby would/could normally wake up? As in you expected this to happen?\n\nYour reasoning was still valid because of course he does have a part in this to take care of the children. You considered him not having work the next day. His reaction was most likely out of sleep deprivation. But at the same time a mother at home does more work than he could imagine. It\u2019s not a vacation. Especially with 3 kids.", " *I was called every curse word in the book and when I asked why my partner at no point tried to pick up or soothe the baby I was told that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have tits to put the baby back to sleep so what would be the point?\u201d*\n\nstop allowing this person to procreate using your uterus.  please stop!", "This is an abusive relationship. It's not strictly violence so does not violate the rules, but....", "NAH maybe...\n\nYou were allowed to try to have a shower after being alone with 3 kids under 3 for 3 days\n\nHis grumpiness probably stemmed from being exhausted after 3 days of travel and work. \n\nThe \"maybe\" is to say that he needs to be involved with parenting his children. If this was just a sleep deprived one-off then all good. If he is constantly mean to you for no good reason then we have issues here.", "i'm going to assume his 3-6 hour commutes are normal, and not the exception.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nESH - he can't be blamed for you not taking care of your hygiene.  I cannot believe that when the two older kids were asleep and the baby put to bed you didn't have time to take a shower in all that time.  granted the day your husband came home was different, as the kids were up late.  \n\nWhile, intentional or not, you do deserve the blame for the incident as a whole, his response was utterly out of proportion to the \"crime\" so to speak.  i don't care how tired you are, the tantrum he threw was insane.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
