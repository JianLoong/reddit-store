Even though you're a stay-at-home mom, that doesn't mean you're the only one with parental responsibilities. The idea of letting your partner sleep while you take care of the baby at night so he's not driving drowsy is a fine concept, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have to do anything ever at night time. And the fact that it was a night where he didn't have to drive the next day is the icing on the cake. \n\nTaking a shower for the first time in several days while there's another adult around is not a selfish act or weaponizing your baby, it's basic human hygiene that you shouldn't have to apologize for. Tell your partner it's time to start being a parent.", "NTA and he\u2019s a massive asshole for his response. Absolutely 100% UNACCEPTABLE even I\u2019d you had been doing it out of spite, which clearly was not the case.", "NTA. This is not the way a person should speak to their partner. Is he often like this?", "NTA i would much rather take a 6 hour commute over being alone 24/7 with 2 toddlers and a baby. Even if they\u2019re miraculously all asleep at the same time you\u2019re probably too exhausted at that point as well to shower and your sleep takes priority. You seem like a good mom to sacrifice your needs for your kids, but when your partner is actually home he needs to step up, and should never speak to you that way. Don\u2019t have anymore kids with this guy, and I\u2019d look into getting some help with the kids because he clearly won\u2019t", "NTA. Your partner sounds abusive, I'm sorry. And the fact that he won't even try to soothe his own child? Eck.", "No, you are NTA for assuming it would be ok to let the baby wake up your partner because you desperately needed a shower. You are not a robot, you are a human being who needs basic hygiene and self-care. You were not selfish, vindictive, unsupportive, or using the baby as a weapon. You were just trying to take care of yourself after a long and hard week. Your partner was the AH for being livid, cursing at you, refusing to help with the baby, and dismissing your needs. He is also the baby\u2019s parent and he should be able to comfort and soothe him without \u201ctits\u201d. He should have been more understanding and supportive of you, and he should have apologized for his outburst.", "NTA. I bet he got perfect, long sleep time Wed and Thurs nights away while you were doing 100% of childcare and couldn't even get a shower for yourself. You've given him way too much of a break on care duties if he doesn't even know how to pick up his baby to soothe it (or thinks it's all about sticking food in the baby's mouth).", "NTA, you both are parents! Him working does not excuse him from all parental duties! The hours he works equal the hours you take care of the kids! So evening and weekends are a shared responsibility between you two!\n\nDid he expect you to just not shower at all? And even if you did intend to care fore the baby, how were you suppised to get to them from the shower fast enough to not wake ur husband?\n\nYou better talk to him and put him in his place, or find a job yourself and make him feel first hand how much care is still left after the 9-5 hours?!", "NTA, and that is simply an unacceptable way for your partner to speak to you.  There\u2019s also no comparing the exhaustion of taking care of 3 kids 24/7 with being a little worn out after driving for a few hours (I\u2019m also a parent and a 3 hour drive alone is like a vacation!). You need a break sometimes too, and your partner needs to step up and be a parent sometimes.", "NTA. To those who said that she could have found time to shower during those 3 days clearly do not understand the unpredictability of parenthood. And even if all 3 kids happened to be asleep at the same time, there are so many things that normally take priority over a shower that also needs to get done (like cleaning bottles, prepping food, laundry, eating something or sleep) You don\u2019t know how much time you actually have until one of them wakes up or needs you, and you want to be able to get to them asap. If you were in the shower how would you hear them, or get to them if they needed you? Having another adult in the house during that time is the safest option for the kids and there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with assuming your husband could handle soothing a baby for 15 mins until you were done. He is just as much responsible for those kids as you are, and he needs to help you prioritize yourself every once in a while (especially since you always do that for him).", "NTA - you are both parents and he needs to step up. I'm currently breastfeeding my 5 month old, if I was showering and he woke, my husband would soothe him, he wouldn't complain, he wouldn't be bothered about losing sleep, he'd do what a parent should do.\n\nYou need to have a think about if you want this for your future, his inability to parent is the issue. Working is not an excuse to not parent - EVER.", "NTA. Just a general inquiry is that a time the baby would/could normally wake up? As in you expected this to happen?\n\nYour reasoning was still valid because of course he does have a part in this to take care of the children. You considered him not having work the next day. His reaction was most likely out of sleep deprivation. But at the same time a mother at home does more work than he could imagine. It\u2019s not a vacation. Especially with 3 kids.", " *I was called every curse word in the book and when I asked why my partner at no point tried to pick up or soothe the baby I was told that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have tits to put the baby back to sleep so what would be the point?\u201d*\n\nstop allowing this person to procreate using your uterus.  please stop!", "This is an abusive relationship. It's not strictly violence so does not violate the rules, but....", "NAH maybe...\n\nYou were allowed to try to have a shower after being alone with 3 kids under 3 for 3 days\n\nHis grumpiness probably stemmed from being exhausted after 3 days of travel and work. \n\nThe \"maybe\" is to say that he needs to be involved with parenting his children. If this was just a sleep deprived one-off then all good. If he is constantly mean to you for no good reason then we have issues here.", "i'm going to assume his 3-6 hour commutes are normal, and not the exception.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nESH - he can't be blamed for you not taking care of your hygiene.  I cannot believe that when the two older kids were asleep and the baby put to bed you didn't have time to take a shower in all that time.  granted the day your husband came home was different, as the kids were up late.  \n\nWhile, intentional or not, you do deserve the blame for the incident as a whole, his response was utterly out of proportion to the \"crime\" so to speak.  i don't care how tired you are, the tantrum he threw was insane.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Boohoo, commuting. Interacting and playing with kids is BARE MINIMUM. He cant handle the commute time AND actually be a parent? Hm, maybe he needs a new job location OR HE NEEDS TO SUCK IT UP. Being a parent isnt easy, nor is it something you get to take a break from. She wanted to shower, he couldnt handle being awake to care for A KID THAT IS ALSO HIS? Tough shit, suck it up.", "You presume and project a lot about me", "...well that mental image is stuck in my brain forever now, thank you \ud83e\udd2e", "Oh my gosh this made me lol for reals. Thank you for this visual.", "EXACTLY!  Parenting is supposed to be a joint effort.  Whatever thought process has her questioning if she was in the wrong *for taking a shower* is not indicative to a healthy situation.", "Ty!", "It really makes me wonder what I don't know about the private lives of men I know.", "Because once in one it\u2019s so easy to stop. You don\u2019t always know the type of parent one will be til you are. Also depending on where she lives access to bc and abortions could be hard", "Start learning anything about abuse before being aggressively wrong on the internet.", "At least that dude was honest with himself lol", "[deleted]", "and yet you argue the points in a way that goes with what i said or \"assumed\", you don't deny either \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "She's literally the one 24/7 caring for them, so yea she's doing great with parenting. Oh no! What a crime, she wanted to SHOWER when her HUSBAND, THE OTHER PARENT OF THE KID, was home? What a crime. You clearly don't know what being a parent is if you think SHE'S wrong \ud83d\ude02 Your whole \"turn it around\" attempt backfired horribly, just showed us you don't know what's going on and think dads can do bare minimum \ud83e\udd22", "Your mental gymnastics see our points aligning but I\u2019ve yet to see a single eye to eye agreement", "She\u2019s literally not though, he\u2019s home and helped with the kids before taking care of his body\u2019s physical need to sleep and is home for the weekend so she\u2019s not doing 24/7. It shows how highly you think of stay at home moms while minimizing the contributions of the father, including him being home to parent. Turning it around on you was to point out the absurdity of your own argument, not because I thought it was a good argument. We\u2019ll never see eye to eye on this.", "because no points are gonna align, so no mental gymnastics is happening, let alone for alignment \ud83e\udd28  Also you realize \"argue your points in a way with what i said\" means you argue in a way that shows what i \"assumed\" is right? Or do you not comprehend beyond you're own thoughts and \"points\"?", "Lmao imagine thinking that raising 3 kids 3 and under is easy, cuz clearly that's what you're thinking. You realize part of her job is to neglect HER needs to make sure the kids are met first. No one's minimizing anything the dad is supposedly doing, everyone is also pointing (which you fail to see) acting like this because she TOOK A SHOWER and can't seem to fathom comforting their OWN kid for a couple minutes until she's out if they don't calm down is messed up. If anything, you just show is how LITTLE you think of SAHMs and their ability to put kids above all their own needs. \"Him being home to parent\", clearly he's not if he's acting like comforting HIS BABY for a few minutes is so HEINOUS that he needs to cuss out his wife for taking a shower \ud83e\udd28", "[deleted]", "He prioritized the kids when he let the baby cry and screamed at his wife for taking a shower. Yea okay buddy \ud83d\ude02 Toddlers are gonna get excited when a parent gets home, parent isnt always being \"helpful\" either, half the time it's just riling the kid up so it's hard to go to bed. What part of \"working doesn't absolve you from being a parent\" don't you see to get? I mean 99% of the comments here get it, but you don't? You do realize that the implications of \"she didn't do it when he was awake\" ARE LITERALLY HIM NOT DOING ANYTHING OR IGNORING THEM? She's busy doing the parenting stuff so finally she gets the chance to shower after he could've, like an ACTUAL husband and dad would've done \"Oh go take a shower\" or \"relax for a few minutes, i got this, I'm gonna get some sleep after\" or \"I'm gonna take a nap/sleep but don't worry about baby/kids\"."]}
