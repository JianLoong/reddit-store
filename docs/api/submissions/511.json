You were clear about the limitations.\n\nTBH though I\u2019d be shocked if all 35 people she invited actually showed up.  As you said, many of them are not close friends.  If it\u2019s more convenient for you to have the party at home then I think you will find the number of guests who show up to be within your limits.

We've all had that run in at the store and heard the we have to get together and agree without meaning it. So I'd bet only half show up. Also does the park have bathroom facilities? For a pregnant person that could be part of the issue. Good luck and thank you for being kind.", "You don't want people in your house that nobody knows well. Do it at a park or not at all.", "NTA.
