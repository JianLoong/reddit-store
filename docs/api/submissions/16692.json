See how quickly words become extremely important to him.", "NTA. \n\nI have been with my partner for almost 5 years, have no desire to be married, but I would be super annoyed if he called me his wife to people. First, because I am not calling him my husband to people, and at some point that creates confusion (oh I met your husband last week...I'm not married?) and people who figure out that you aren't married are going to feel weird about it (why did they lie to me?).  Second, there is nothing awkward about saying \"girlfriend\" or \"partner\" unless he thinks he should be married and then...well get married? Third, it is simply untrue and just feels off to me to give titles to thinks that are not true. \n\nYou also aren't pressuring him to marry you. If he thinks things will go downhill if you get married, or just doesn't want to get married, then that is fine. But, then he can't say he is married/introduce you as his wife. If he wants to call you his wife, he can marry you. It's not that complicated, and don't let him put his issues all over you like you are doing something here- pressuring him to get married, etc- because it is a total normal reaction to not want to be identified falsely.", "NTA. I agree with you. If he wants to call you his wife, then he needs to marry you.", "NTA. This is odd and you're right to pull him up on it.", "So he's saying he wants a common law marriage & wants you to go along with it?

There's a lot of other words besides \"girlfriend\" but if you like being called girlfriend then that's what he should use.\n\nThe part about him thinking everything will go down hill if you actually get married is a bit concerning. In one instance he's saying it's a piece of paper and doesn't matter in order to call you wife and then in another legal  marriage is such a big deal it would cause the relationship to fall apart. That doesn't track. Even though you have been together so long and have a house together, it sounds like he's having a hard time with that last little papery step in commitment. \n\nSounds like there is fertile ground for exploration and growth, maybe as a journey toward that official step. Relationships don't fall apart because of pieces of paper. If something was going to cause it all to break then there was something there that wasn't addressed the whole time. Also, growth, change, and development doesn't stop because the legality of the relationship changes. I'm guessing you have already been through a lot and grown together. That continues. Have you considered finding a couples therapist? Not coming at it from a something has to be fixed but as a this is another opportunity/tool for us to maintain a healthy positive relationship. And an opportunity to build a relationship that can withstand any changes a piece of paper might make, real or imaginary.\n\nOne last random question. Wondering how his parents split effected him. Did he have to take on more partnership or emotional labor roles to his mom or did he feel abandoned in another way? Just asking questions, no need to lay it out here. I'm wondering if there are other symptoms of challenge between you besides wanting to call you wife but not getting an official document to do so.", "NTA. The fact is you are NOT married. I think you are being very reasonable about this. Stick to your guns.", "NTA. That would annoy me because as you say it\u2019s not accurate and marriage is a legally binding contract that does have certain implications. I don\u2019t really get why he thinks it\u2019s easier or less awkward? He thinks it\u2019s embarrassing or something to have been together 7 years bought a house and not be married?", "NTA it\u2019s clear that you both have a different view of what marriage means. \n\nAs someone who subscribes to your partner\u2019s view I suggest you change how you communicate your displeasure (you should not have to do this, but here we are).\n\nTo him, you are his wife. So telling him you are not, is not going to help. In fact, he may consider this hurtful.\n\nBefore you speak to him, try validating the seriousness of the relationship first. Then reiterate its your *personal preference* not to be called wife and that you would appreciate if he respected this. \n\nDon\u2019t drag the institution of marriage and the related paper into this, that\u2019s worthless to him. *You* are valuable to him and your preference matters.", "INFO\n\nDo you live somewhere with common law marriage?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't know where you live but in some places common law means you can call each other husband and wife. I've been with my partner almost 20 years, we're not married legally but I call him my husband and he calls me wife. It's just easier shorthand for the relationship than explaining to others why we're not married and never will be. The point is, we have a marriage... marriage is what comes after the wedding and it's not beautiful or more commited or anything. It's the day to day hard work and choice to stay together, and taking care of each other, and picking up his socks for the millionth time, and scooping her hair out of the drain, and making the same fucking dinner for the hundredth time, and the absolute monotony of life together and just trying to get through it together. Weddings are the easy part, sometimes beautiful, but it is just a very expensive piece of paper. I acknowledge that in some places that paper also gives additional benefits to couples, and would be a reason for a ceremony, but if it's just about words like husband/wife vs partner/girlfriend/boyfriend then it's kind of silly.", "NTA obvs", "Actually common law marriage is not that widespread!

Common law marriages can be messy to break off. If OP has any assets it could be up for grabs if they break it off.

Nowhere are they married.", ">he wants to tell people I\u2019m his wife because it\u2019s easier/less awkward (his words) than saying his girlfriend\n\nIt has nothing to do with believing she's already his wife.

If people assume we are married, use the terms husband and wife, we just go with it.

Great - you do you! \n\nBut husband/wife is not OP's legal relationship, and she does not want to lie or pretend about it.\n\nIf OP's bf doesn't feel that \"girlfriend\" is adequate, he can choose any number of factually accurate alternatives like \"partner\",  \"SO\", etc. He does not get to force \"wife\" on her. If he wants her to be called wife,  he has to make her his wife. If not, he doesn't get to call her that. It's really quite straightforward.", "And I totally agree with you. And I agree that he should stop calling OP his \u201cwife\u201d.\n\nI have simply shed some light on *his* point of view.\n\nAlso, I have suggested how can OP try to put stop to it by approaching it in a way that\u2019s understandable to her BF/partner."]}
