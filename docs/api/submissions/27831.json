Normally I wouldn't bring this up, but it is relevant to this story. She's pretty high functioning, but the main way her autism effects her is a really strong special interest in one specific fictional character. I've never had an issue with this, and I try to keep up with whatever's going on in the fandom for her and listen to her infodumping about her favorite character on a regular basis. \n\nAbout a year ago, my girlfriend got a body pillow of her favorite character. I didn't really have an issue with it, as we have a very large bed with more than enough room for something like a body pillow. The body pillow wasn't even that weird as far as body pillows go, it's just her favorite character wearing her normal outfit on one side and a simple dress on the other. Definitely not weird compared to other kinds of body pillows out there. \n\nRecently, my girlfriend told me she's getting more covers and another pillow inner so she can have two body pillows to sleep with at once. I was more apprehensive about this, as our bed is big, but two five feet long pillows plus two people feels like it would be pushing it. She assured me that if it was really an issue, she could go back to only sleeping with one, or alternatively lay one of them Lincoln style and use it as a regular pillow, so I agreed to it once again. \n\nThe real issue arouse when the pillow covers actually arrived yesterday. She did get another cover of her favorite character, as I'd expected, but what I hadn't was that she'd also gotten a cover featuring her favorite character's DAD. I'd always known she had a little crush on him but I never thought it would go THAT far. Worse, this pillow isn't just him in a normal outfit like her original one. One of the sides full on has his dick and balls out for the world to see. \n\nI told my girlfriend that I'm putting my foot down, and I refuse to sleep in a bed with another man, even if that man is a pillow. She said that that's ridiculous, it's not like he's real, and one of the sides is SFW so if I'm really uncomfortable she can just keep it flipped to that side. \n\nI said that I still don't feel comfortable with that. I know I wouldn't be able to forget the uncomfortably detailed dick lying in wait on the other side of the pillow, especially if I have to sleep right next to it. She said she can put the pillow with her favorite character (who's female) between us, and keep the dad pillow firmly on her side of the bed, but I said I just don't want him in my bed at all. \n\nShe's pretty pissed about it. Her body pillows are pretty expensive, since she has to get the art custom drawn and then custom printed, and it's not something you can return. The dad character really doesn't have any superfans other than her, so it's not like there's some other girl she can possibly try to sell him to either. I know she's been saving for this pillow a long time, so I do feel guilty saying she can't cuddle with it. AITA?

I could be wrong but I think she probably didn't consider that it would upset you. I'm autistic and my girlfriend isn't, but out of the two of us she's definitely the one to get a body pillow like that, and I don't think I would really care. From my perspective, a pillow is not competition for her affection, because it's just a pillow with some NSFW art on it, so if she wanted to get Sephiroth in the nude on a pillow, I'd say go for it. I suspect (although I could be wrong!) that your girlfriend has the same perspective about her body pillows, where she doesn't see it as something that would make you as a partner feel uncomfortable, because it isn't \"real.\" But at the same time, hearing it explained, I can see why it would be uncomfortable. And of course, you need enough space to sleep comfortably, which two body pillows makes hard! \n\nYou're definitely N T A for having the reaction you did. By that same token, I don't think she's the asshole for reacting poorly in the initial conversation, because it's her special interest and she has invested a lot of money and time and passion in this purchase. I can totally get why she would feel defensive and hurt at your reaction, because as autistics we get shit our whole lives for being \"weird\" or \"creepy\" for the intensity of our interests and for our general demeanour. This situation probably brought up painful feelings for her, and her initial reaction is a reflection of that. Now, I think she would be T A if she refuses to talk it through and compromise after some time to reflect. Hopefully she will be willing to listen after having time to cool down.
