Getting some space means you both have a cooling off period, so that you can continue working on resolving the issue a little later when calmer. People ask for space when they realize they've just about reached their limit and are going to start responding in anger, saying things that they will likely regret after the fact.

Has anyone heard of a comprise? Half and half pizzas exist for a reason. Also- that\u2019s your partner, why is it too much to ask for them to consider your dietary preferences in situations as this that lend themselves to flexibility?", "ESH. You straight up asked him want he wanted, he answered you. He is an arse if he knew you were really only considering one pizza. He is an even bigger arse for thinking you would be okay with \u201ceating at home\u201d, who the fuck ordered takeaway for a partner and not themselves, he needs to get a clue. But you also allowed this to happen. \n\nThe easiest solution to this is you order 2 pizzas. I know you say they are large, but if thats the case, you eat pizza for days, or go to a different pizza store where the sizes are more manageable.

You are obviously over this happening time and time again, and wanted him to come to a solution himself to show he cares about you/priortises you.\n\nI had a partner exaccccttttlllyyy the same. Just had a completely different brain process to me.

In that relationship, i priortised them as #1 and maybe as #2. Its cant be this way, at best you are equal. A conversation (not while you\u2019re trying to order food), about you wanting to feel considered definitely needs to happen, and explaining how it makes you feel to have him not inquiry as to your dietery options (doesnt mean he cant get his meat lovers). But that has to go hand in hand with you voicing what you want and not just allowing everything to be based on his preferences because you think you are being the more considerate person.

You (meaning him) don't order the meat-lover's dinner for two when one is a vegetarian.

It\u2019s nice to be considerate when you eat out once with a friend, or when you\u2019re going on a date together, but just regular eating together can be something where you get different things. \n\nI do want to ask you though, OP, if you got the food you really wanted, without considering him, how would he react?

I'm a people pleaser like you but learned to manage it through therapy. Before I would have acted exactly like you did here.

His answer propably just meant he wanted the pizza he wanted but yours had a dozen hidden meanings that you wished he'd be able to interpret from your answer. That's dishonest and makes you emotionally untrustworthy.\n\nYou keep bending over backwards for other people's wants and needs when there really no need to go overboard like that and always put your own needs last. It's very common for people pleasers to do this and it's like they weren't worthy of getting things they like unless someone gives it to them. Like you would be selfish for needing and wanting the most basic things in life, like the type of pizza when you can literally choose anything you like. But that's not really true at all - putting your needs on the same line as everyone elses is no the same as putting them before them. \n\nThis is putting other people in charge of your happiness. You end up resenting the fact that people can't read you mind and you're not getting the same consideration in return. But they weren't even in the know that this is the deal you're expecting in relationships. That's so unfair. No one's going to know what you want and need unless you communicate it to them. \n\n>He also said that I hurt him by saying untrue things like he\u2019s not considering my feelings.

All they did was reply honestly to your question about what kind of pizza they liked and suddenly they're being blamed for hurting your feelings. That makes it really emotionally consuming to be around you, because they can never trust that you mean what you say you're thinking.  \n\nIn the future, communicate your needs and wants out loud. If there's a missmatch of wants, it's ok to want different things. Not everything needs to be a compromise and you can want things just because you do. Your needs don't need the validation of others to be just as real as their needs.

When dating I don't force dietary restrictions on my partner, but I do make them use a different utensil to try my food if they'd like some & so far all of them have been understanding. All of them have also brushed their teeth after eating meat and before kissing me (the other reason I'm vegetarian is because I used to eat meat but the taste started grossing me out, once I got really sick after an intense make out session where a partner had eaten sushi 30 mins before) and one even went as far as only ordering vegetarian food when we went out to eat because he was curious about being vegetarian, with no input from me whatsoever. If a couple really wants to make it work there are ways. \n\nThat being said, I grew up and currently live in areas where being vegetarian is almost common, half my friend group is vegetarian or vegan and the other half prefers to spend time with the whole friend group rather than split up to get food, so there have been multiple times where all the meat eaters have decided on sushi or burgers or whatever, but then a vegetarian ends up being free so they immediately change plans to get a vegetarian friendly food like Mexican or Indian food so that the one person doesn't have to eat alone.", "Probably he\u2019d have asked what she wants without having said out loud what he wants, she\u2019d say something veggie, and then he\u2019d just order her veggie pizza and his meat pizza without making a big deal of it. Like a reasonable adult.", "Atleast at the places we go two small pizzas is about the same as the cost of a large.  Maybe $3-4 more but not too bad.  So that makes that option much more bearable for us.", "[removed]", "Where I live we have caramel banana pizza, strawberry and chocolate pizza, and so on", "I only play one in RPG's. :-)", "[removed]", "she asked what he wanted and he answered. nothing stopped her from getting food she liked other than her temper tantrum over what food HE likes", "It's not just about liking food or not, vegetarians literally don't eat meat. She was hoping he'd be considered of her needs too, but seems like he didn't care.", "It's always the pizza gone first at the parties I go to \ud83e\udd23", "Sounds like you guys should stop ordering three ham and pineapple pizzas then. Maybe just order one or two if there's always 1.5 left. \n\nWith my friends group, it's always either the plain cheese or the veggie pies that have the most slices leftover, but we don't usually have an entire one of any left.", "I find that's because people say they will eat whatever but then don't. At my work pizza party. I'm the only one who wanted just pep and cheese. Everyone else wanted works (everything basically). Opened up the box of pep and it's all gone. Turns out everyone actually wanted one of each but only mentioned works. So I'm stuck with works and I'm the only one who asked for pep.\nPeople just suck.", "In my experience those are always the first pizzas that are gone. And as a lover of ham and pineapple pizza it always made me sad because they were gone so fast.", "My husband\u2019s favorite is pepperoni, pineapple and jalape\u00f1os with no cheese. I like pepperoni, pineapple and mushroom. I would totally share with you.", "and she couldn\u2019t get half veggie? or 2 small pizzas? is she not old enough to order her food by herself and needs some sort of help or recommendation? normally when i ask someone what they want to eat, they don\u2019t tell me what i should get too. i just figure it out for myself like an adult", "So she just doesn\u2019t eat? She can\u2019t get her own food because he was inconsiderate? Get grazing on the front lawn I guess.", "Always. Also if you ALWAYS have that specific type left over-WHY ARE YOU ORDERING SO MANY?", "Pepperoni and *no cheese*?! Absolutely fascinating. Pizza night at my house, extra pineapple!", "People can eat their pizza's the way they want, I don't care whatsoever what anyone else eats...until I read this.  \nGoddamn menace if he doesn't have a medical reason to skip the cheese.", "It\u2019s giving psychopathic", "Desperately needs to be the victim even if it means shooting herself in the foot on purpose this one"]}
