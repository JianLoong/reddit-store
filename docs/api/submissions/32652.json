Three years ago they first met at my family\u2019s 4th of July cookout. A few weeks after that they started dating which at first was a little weird to me seeing as though she\u2019s my best friend and he\u2019s my brother. \n\nThey eventually got engaged and got married two years ago through court with my parents, her parents, my older sister and me being present. Unfortunately, the marriage didn\u2019t last long. They divorced four months after and my brother ended up getting his own apartment. Right around that time he met his now-fianc\u00e9e whom he is set to marry next year in February. \n\nNow getting to the upcoming Christmas dinner part. My parents are hosting Christmas dinner at their house and when I found out my best friend wasn\u2019t spending Christmas with her family due to them planning to do their own thing this year I decided to invite her to my parents\u2019 home with my parents permission of course. I told my brother about it to give him a heads up. He didn\u2019t care or mind. But when his fianc\u00e9e found out about it she called me asking why did I think it was okay to invite my brother\u2019s ex to my family Christmas dinner. I reminded her that my brother\u2019s ex been my best friend before the two met. She actually knew about this when my brother first told her. But she didn\u2019t accept that. She told me I was being disrespectful inviting my brother\u2019s ex wife and I told her if she has a problem with MY BEST FRIEND being there she can just stay home. I feel as though I shouldn\u2019t have to stop inviting my friend to events just because my soon to be SIL have an issue with it.", "created_utc": 1702089584, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18e3in3/aita_for_inviting_my_brothers_exwife_to_my/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This person was family to you *before* she married your brother. Just because your brother got involved, doesn't mean his fianc\u00e9e now gets veto power.\n\nI understand she's uncomfortable, I would be, too. But she knew the deal, she had to know this would come up at some point. She just assumed that her opinion would weigh more, and it doesn't. Your brother needs to make it clear to her that, ring or no ring, wedding or no wedding, she doesn't get to decide who is family. Especially when everyone else is okay with it.\n\nAn aside, this is the kind of thing we get the other side of on here all the time. New wife upset that the whole family likes the ex better than the new wife, or that the old wife isn't being cut out to make her comfortable. It rarely ends well.", "NTA\n\nAs she's your best friend there are going to be many social situations where both she and your SIL will be invited.  SIL might as well get used to it now before they get married.", "I think most people would be uncomfortable with their partners ex at a family holiday. Different where there is kids involved. I understand the ex is your best friend but not a good start to building a relationship with SIL. You total lack of regards of her feelings in your comments is what makes YTA. I was a bit more understanding before that. I hope your brother considers her feelings and stays away.", "NTA - since your parents and your brother were fine with her being invited then you are NTA. I understand why the finance may be uncomfortable, at least the first couple of times they have to interact, but it doesn't sound like she is going anywhere anytime soon so the fianc\u00e9 will need to work that out for herself.", "NTA\n\nShe was your best friend BEFORE they got together. Most importantly, their marriage was clearly a dumpster fire...it lasted all of 4 months. Your FSIL is being insecure. As someone who's been in her shoes, yes it was uncomfortable, but I was an adult about it. His ex being clearly uncomfortable too made me feel better about my own feelings. At the end of the day, my dude is f'ing with me lol As long as everyone is acting right. Not throwing indirects or mean mugging from across the Xmas table then it should all be good. She should suck it up and attend this time, if some drama goes down ( drama not instigated by herself) then she would be in the right to insist on future holidays excluding the friend. She needs to grow up.", "NTA \n\nshe was around and important before she had a romance with your brother \n\nYou checked with your parents and brother first \u2026.\n\nNew sis in law needs to grow up", "NTA\n\nYour brother decided to date and marry your best friend. He knew the possible fallout would be messy. His now fianc\u00e9e d9esnt gave the right to dictate your family's guest list, and if you're allowed to invite your best friend to family events.", "NTA. There nothing wrong with inviting a family friend who's been part of your holidays for years. It would nonsensical to banish her now because of a short lived marriage mistake both parties agreed to end amicably. \n\nAs a woman who has smiled through the past 30 years of family holidays (+ graduations, baby showers, class plays, cheerleading competitions, kid's birthdays, and eventually grandchildren's birthdays) with my ex-husband and the woman he cheated on me with I can say with experience and love to your future SIL \"Get over yourself. Life happens and seldom asks your permission.\" Here's hoping she has the grace to pull up her big girl panties and deal with it.", "NTA - you went to your parents and brother to make sure it was okay. Due diligence performed.\n\nIf anything, she shoukd be expressing her discontent to her fiancee, not you.", "YTA - your brother\u2019s current fianc\u00e9e shouldn\u2019t have to share holidays with his ex wife.", "YTA\n\nHow would you feel if you were invited to your new BF's family for Christmas to find that his ex wife is going to be there. You would be like his new GF is very upset and annoyed.\n\nSorry but this is an AH trick on your part, why would you do this, you must have known this situation would escalate like this.\n\nI hope your Brother does the right thing and stays away  with his new GF.", "Am I TA? I don\u2019t care what anyone says, I\u2019m not TA! You sound so immature. Don\u2019t ask the question if you have no intention of considering people\u2019s responses. Enjoy being right and creating a rift in your family.", "YTA, 100% you can easily join her for part of Christmas instead of bringing your brothers ex wife into your parents home and alienating his fianc\u00e9. Don\u2019t be surprised if your brother grows a pair and changes his mind to support his future wife and this affects your future relationships with him, her and any children that they have.", "Honestly ESH. You, your parents, your BF/ ex SIL, your brother\u2026. Not one of you thought to check if his fiance minded. Not crazy about her either tbh but I\u2019m unsure if it\u2019s just your description to justify the BS that makes her sound dictatorial and unreasonable. I\u2019m just glad I\u2019m not her because I wouldn\u2019t want to marry into your family if I get disinvited because the ex is more important", "YTA \n\nMy husbands sisters did this to me with his ex-wife.  They pulled a bunch of stunts and tried to split us up.  What happened instead is that we moved cities and he cut off his family for 15 years.     \n\nIf you are wanting to drive a wedge in your family you are going about it the right way.  If you want to keep your friend you can do that without having her come to family functions.", "You asked everyone EXCEPT the fiance because as you state outright in your comments here you \u201cdon\u2019t care about her feelings\u201d.

It would be bad enough to invite her if your brother was single. You are doubly the AH for expecting his fianc\u00e9e to be okay with it. Your brother is an AH for thinking it's okay. Parents are pretty dense at best. Do you plan to do this for all holidays when the ex is alone?", "YTA why do you wanna spend Christmas being a petty mf lmao", "So is your friend so toxic that she has no other friends whose brothers she didn\u2019t fuck who could invite her over for Christmas or do you just like stirring shit up? YTA", "NTA. That\u2019s your best friend.", "NTA. BFF was there first. SIL can kick rocks.", "NTA", "It's entirely the choice of your brother's fiance if she wants to create an elephant in the room rather than understand that your friendship with the ex pre-dates their time together. The fiance needs to remind herself what the \"spirit of Christmas\" means.\n\nNTA", "NTA - Your brother should have told you he had to double check with fianc\u00e9e first.", "YTA", "That\u2019s the thing.

The only time they will all see each other each other besides this upcoming Christmas dinner is on 4 of July which is when we usually have our cookouts.", "what a load of rubbish OP is an AH", "But she was my friend before she even met my brother. I been inviting her to a few gatherings before they even became a thing.", "There are millions of ex-spouses and new spouses/fianc\u00e9es who manage to amicably share holidays and other family gatherings without trying to dictate the guest list or make it all about them.", "Her brother approved of her inviting his ex, or did you skip over that part?", "He already told me even if she decides not to attend he will still come because he understands that I knew his ex-wife before him anyway.", "No one is going to uninvite her. She just wants me to stop inviting my best friend to gatherings. Like every summer we have cookouts for 4th of July and that\u2019s something my best friend always attended to before my future SIL came into the future. My future SIL even told me that she no longer wants me inviting my best friend to that but I told her I\u2019m not going to do that since I feel as though she doesn\u2019t get to dictate when I can have my friend around, especially when it\u2019s not even SIL\u2019s home.", "I wasn\u2019t thinking about myself\u2026.", "You could aptly address this response to the fianc\u00e9e. She's marrying into a family that had lives, relationships, and family traditions that BF was a part of long before fianc\u00e9e arrived.

I\u2019m actually being a good and caring friend towards my best friend.", "You seem to be missing the bit where OP had a pre-existing relationship with brother\u2019s ex-wife. In the absence of any bad behaviour by the best friend that caused the divorce, there\u2019s no reason to exclude her. Future SIL needs to suck this one up.", "Info: I do have one question, what was the main reason they got divorced? \n\nThis will influence my judgment.", "I wasn't saying they were literally family, I was saying that her best friend was like family *to OP*, and possibly to her wider family if they've been friends for a long time.", "For what? Inviting soneone her parents and brother had no issues with? Lmao\n\nWhat a load of BS, not everyone hates their ex's, her brother obviously doesnt", "So go to her house. It doesn\u2019t matter that she was your friend first, it matters that your future SIL is uncomfortable with the arrangement.", "That makes your Brother an AH as well.", "Yup. Sticking with the ESH. What a sh-t show. Enjoy Christmas, should be really fun and peaceful", "Then who were you thinking about? Not your future sister in law that's for sure", "If your future sister-in-law's feelings don't matter to you, your brother, and your family, she may take the hint and break it off. From what you present, you are okay with that. This could be a roadblock for your brother remarrying.", "Let\u2019s just call a spade a spade here. This isn\u2019t about your poor friend alone at Christmas. You don\u2019t like the new girl, you\u2019re upset they divorced and now you\u2019re sticking it to the poor new girl.", "Lmao ok. People like you are exactly the reason why people skip family reunions.", "I don\u2019t hate my exes but I\u2019m also not spending f\u2019ing Xmas day with them come ON lol", "No. She\u2019s coming to my family\u2019s Christmas dinner and that\u2019s that.

I\u2019m not the one who put a ring on her finger.", "Well, you don\u2019t personally know me to tell me what I\u2019m feeling.", "Some do, move on", "Then why did you post and ask? You have decided to ignore everyone's judgements that you do not like. It makes you a double AH for that alone. Your future SIL is uncomfortable, and you do not care. Why don't you set up a meeting between your friend (the ex) and her so they can get more comfortable with each other? Stop being obstinate and show you have room in your heart for future SIL.", "Then you are absolutely TA and I certainly hope your brother honours her wishes and they both skip dinner.\nI also hope they remove you from the wedding guest list since you obviously do not give a shit about your future SIL\u2019s feelings.", "He is supposed getting married to the girl, so she is not going to be able to come to family functions after they are married because his ex wife is going to be there. \n\nI imagine that she won't be his fianc\u00e9 much longer after this if he won't put her first this Christmas.", "LMAO. No way I would marry into this sh-t show of a family. Sometimes I think posters on this sub are all teenagers because you can\u2019t be serious that this is a reasonable way for people to behave", "That is very true, but basic consideration is a fundamental part of life. She also needs to learn that, but that still doesn't stop you being the bigger asshole in this particular situation", "And he\u2019s also not going to allow her to not invite me from the wedding", "He\u2019s not going to. He already told me he will attend even if she decides not to.", "You think no ex-wives ever come to family functions? LMAO", "I mean, if that makes me an asshole then I guess so be it. I don\u2019t owe her any loyalty.", "Then I hope his fianc\u00e9e dumps his ass for putting his ex wife first", "WOW! Please show your brother and entire family this post, including all your comments. I think he may change his mind about Christmas, and about you. Talk about self-centered.", "You don't, she doesn't owe you that either so I guess you're just gonna have to deal with each other", "He\u2019s not putting his ex wife first. He\u2019s being mature enough to allow me have my best friend around even though he is no longer with her because he understands that I knew my best friend first anyway.", "\ud83e\udd47", "Are you 12? Why do you need your friend to be at your family\u2019s Christmas dinner? She is no longer family and I am sure there are other days you could hang out when your brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e isn\u2019t there.", "I don\u2019t need her there. She\u2019s my best friend and I didn\u2019t want her to spend Christmas alone. I wanted her there. So she\u2019s going to be there."]}
