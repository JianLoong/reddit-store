Just because your brother got involved, doesn't mean his fianc\u00e9e now gets veto power.\n\nI understand she's uncomfortable, I would be, too. But she knew the deal, she had to know this would come up at some point. She just assumed that her opinion would weigh more, and it doesn't. Your brother needs to make it clear to her that, ring or no ring, wedding or no wedding, she doesn't get to decide who is family. Especially when everyone else is okay with it.\n\nAn aside, this is the kind of thing we get the other side of on here all the time. New wife upset that the whole family likes the ex better than the new wife, or that the old wife isn't being cut out to make her comfortable. It rarely ends well.", "NTA\n\nAs she's your best friend there are going to be many social situations where both she and your SIL will be invited.  SIL might as well get used to it now before they get married.", "I think most people would be uncomfortable with their partners ex at a family holiday. Different where there is kids involved. I understand the ex is your best friend but not a good start to building a relationship with SIL. You total lack of regards of her feelings in your comments is what makes YTA. I was a bit more understanding before that. I hope your brother considers her feelings and stays away.", "NTA - since your parents and your brother were fine with her being invited then you are NTA. I understand why the finance may be uncomfortable, at least the first couple of times they have to interact, but it doesn't sound like she is going anywhere anytime soon so the fianc\u00e9 will need to work that out for herself.", "NTA\n\nShe was your best friend BEFORE they got together. Most importantly, their marriage was clearly a dumpster fire...it lasted all of 4 months. Your FSIL is being insecure. As someone who's been in her shoes, yes it was uncomfortable, but I was an adult about it. His ex being clearly uncomfortable too made me feel better about my own feelings. At the end of the day, my dude is f'ing with me lol As long as everyone is acting right. Not throwing indirects or mean mugging from across the Xmas table then it should all be good. She should suck it up and attend this time, if some drama goes down ( drama not instigated by herself) then she would be in the right to insist on future holidays excluding the friend.

There nothing wrong with inviting a family friend who's been part of your holidays for years.

Life happens and seldom asks your permission.\" Here's hoping she has the grace to pull up her big girl panties and deal with it.", "NTA - you went to your parents and brother to make sure it was okay.

You, your parents, your BF/ ex SIL, your brother\u2026. Not one of you thought to check if his fiance minded.

After reading some of your comments here, it\u2019s obvious you are doing this to spite your FSIL. No one expect you to cut out a friendship because your brother divorced her. But you can spend any time with her, so why exactly christmas where his fiance will be uncomfortable? There are no kids involved and there is no reason why she has to spend christmas with her EX and his fiance. \n\nI really hope his fiance see through you and your lack of empathy for her and run fast from this shit show.", "I know I'm going to get downvoted but ESH\n\nI get it, she was your best friend long before she was your SIL and your brothers wife. But now she's also your brothers ex-wife. Some people may associate her with being the ex-wife before they associate her was being your friend. If we're being honest, most people would be uncomfortable finding out their fianc\u00e9 ex wife will be at Christmas when the marriage didn't produce any kids and was very short lived. That's the kinda situation where if you were discuss it with your friends, you'd be wondering, \"where does it end? If she's at Christmas is she going to be at our wedding, his birthday, all family holidays?\" Remember the fianc\u00e9 is still trying to get a feel for your family and her place in it.\n\nYour family and brother may side with you on this family event, and your friend may be welcomed at the fianc\u00e9 discomfort this Christmas. But it would be wise to prepare that everyone may change their opinion and you may find yourself outnumbered next Christmas. Especially post wedding or if they have any kids. If your brothers smart, at very least he will be advocating for his wife over his ex-wife post wedding.", "YTA,\nShe is your friend, I get that, but at the same time, she's your brother's ex wife. The marriage lasted only 4 months. That doesn't make the ex a family. You just created an awkward situation between your brother and his fiancee and yourself. I don't see how the fiancee is supposed to enjoy her time at your parents' Christmas dinner when she knows that her fiance's ex wife is there too. \nYou were also rude to tell her to stay home if she doesn't like it. Even though in the comments you mentioned that your family likes her. \nYou should take some food and snacks and go spend Christmas with the ex wife of your brother if you are that worried for her staying alone. \nOr maybe you are looking for some Christmas drama to happen.", "NAH It's just a bit of a messy situation.\nHopefully FSIL and best friend will meet and get along. Sometimes we have to deal with the fact that we all have a history. \nIf best friend is seen as OP's best friend rather than brother's ex, it'll be fine.

It is a pretty fucked up situation and you handled it badly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour SIL also is TH the way she phrases her concern. Your parents can invite who every they want.

If you continue to invite her to family things, depending on how much your brother supports his fianc\u00e9e, he may end up not coming to things either. Just as a way to support his fianc\u00e9e.

Your brother (and parents) seem to be OK with it, it\u2019s not up to the brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e to enforce this decision, probably because she\u2019s insecure.

You have a separate relationship with your brother's ex. My brother's wife is my best friend too. If they ever separate I still invite her to parties.", "Yta, why not have her over yourself before Christmas for a dinner for just the two of you? Family is immediate family for dinners. No exs either", "He is now on the path to his second divorce.", "I'm going with YTA.  I suppose you can invite her if you want, and she can show up knowing full well her presence is going to cause problems.\n\nBut you know what?  She changed the dynamic by marrying your brother.   And you're pretty much ensuring that your relationship with your future SIL is going to be poor.  You sound young and I don't think you appreciate how this is going to impact your relationship with your brother and the family dynamics, as your parents are now going to have to pick a side and potentially mess up their relationship with their future DIL.  If these two stay together and have kids things will be strained.\n\nYou can keep your friendship,  but you don't need to ram her into family events.", "NTA", "Since you we\u2019re friends before NTA but really? A family event? Kinda esh take her out dancing, not to a family event.", "Im not sure either way. The best friend aspect has little to do with it in my thought process. In my entire life my best friend nor any of my 9 brothers snd sisters best friend was a though to invite for Christmas. Christmas is the 1 holiday that is all about family. My kids call my best friend uncle and I introduce him as my brother, a d vice versa, but at the end of the day, he isn't family to anybody else other than me. The new wife to be is a priority in this situation. Ex invited to a summer gathering, in OPs wedding, etc IS a friend thing for the EX to be involved.\n\nJust my take. I see that everyone is a bit of the AH.\n\nYou and parents considered your feelings for the beastie but ignored new basic family member. Hubbies considered your feelings but ignored new GF. GF considered herself but ig owed the family dynamic. Overall, eryone lost in some way.", "YTA she might be your best friend but she is also your brother\u2019s ex wife. Of course it\u2019s not ok to invite her for Christmas which is for family- she\u2019s no longer family. Did you do it on purpose? Still holding some resentment about the divorce and wanted to take it out on the fianc\u00e9? I hope the fianc\u00e9 realizes she can do better than this family and a clueless, ignorant man like your brother", "NTA", "NTA. Your brother and parents were fine with it. It's your parents' house, and she's your best friend. Your brother's fiance should have spoken to him and not you, and a respectful conversation should have been had. Instead, fiance tried to call you directly with her insecurities. \n\nIf they are going to host a get together at their house, they have every right to say she can't be there.", "The only thing that is rare is that your brother met your best friend 3 years ago? Weren't You so close before? Or did she not know your family? Because if she met your family there, it is most likely that your family will relate to her more as your brother's ex than as your best friend.\n\nI have a question, this is the first time you have invited your best friend since they broke up or since your brother is engaged?\nBecause if so, maybe she never thought this could happen and it caught her by surprise\n\nYou should have talked to her first, not to ask permission but to let her know, your parents' opinion is not that relevant but for many people it is strange to see your partner's ex, especially if there are no children.", "YTA. \n\nYour brother is in a relationship with a woman who will be part of the family in the future. Your best friend is not part of your family. That's what happens to spouses when they divorce. It is an insult to your brother's fianc\u00e9e to invite his ex-wife. When you invite your brother's ex to a FAMILY holiday, the message that you send the fianc\u00e9e is that you view the ex as the first, better, preferred, true (pick any of those) in-law / family. It makes the fianc\u00e9e feel second class. \n\nI saw this happen for YEARS with my mom and my stepdad. (I refer to my stepdad as dad, and will do so from here on out.) My dad's extended family gave my dad's ex-wife preferential treatment for years. She was always invited to things by his family for years after their divorce. My dad's ex-wife once got a table up front at one of my cousin's wedding while we sat in the back and around the corner where we could see nothing. At this point in time, my mom had been the in-law for nearly 20 years, four times longer than my dad had been married to his ex-wife. Additionally, there was not a very close relationship between my cousin and my dad's ex. Yet, she was still seated near the wedding party with some of my dad's siblings. It was insulting and hurtful.\n\nIf you don't want your best friend to be alone on or around Christmas, then plan a separate event with her. Bringing her to your family gathering will not make your brother's future wife feel very welcome.", "A little AH bc you created a riff in your family. Your future SIL won't go and it will create resentment in her, your own mother will miss her in the dinner. You basically are putting your future SIL in a bad position in front of your family. If I were her I wouldn't come neither but this will create more problems. In my opinion, you are creating a lot of unnecessary drama. This woman will marry your brother and potentially will be the mother of your nephews and nieces, bad beginning but I get it, you don't care. You seem bad christian, bad person.", "YTA\n\nPut yourself in your brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2019s shoes, how would you feel? Your brother is also the AH for not sticking up for her. \n\nYour friend changed your relationship when she entered into a relationship with your brother, knowing that a break up could possibly change the dynamic. Its perfectly fine to continue a friendship with her but you also need to consider the feelings of your brother\u2019s fiance who is now family.", "NTA. Why is this a phenomenon I see mostly with young women? She is your best friend. You have known her longer than your brother has known his fianc\u00e9e. \n\nShe is going to take precedence over his new woman because you knew her first. \n\nIf you are a women please get out of this selfish ego phase. Nobody owes you or your ego anything. If you are insecure that\u2019s a you problem, not anyone else\u2019s and your stupid ego is going to isolate you from otherwise good relationships. \n\nThe parents agree, the brother doesn\u2019t care and she is the sisters best friend. Do you think the sister is going to be asked to leave because of fianc\u00e9e feelings, no they are going to choose their daughter not you  \n\nYou also don\u2019t get to veto guests at other peoples houses. That\u2019s just rude. Learn some grace and humility.  Be a girls girl and not this vapid wasteland of entitlement.", "I was leaning towards N A H. It was your friend before and the fianc\u00e9e\u2019s feelings are understandable. Then I saw your comments. \nYTA. You don\u2019t care. At all.", "NTA- That future SIL reeks of insecurity and immaturity. The two ends up on a good note then why would she get jealous or something?", "Of course YTA, sorry that your brother and your best friend created problems but here we are. You shouldn't have to stop inviting your friends but this is your future SIL who everyone loves you are making her uncomfortable. You cannot exclude your brother from events with his parents, it is selfish. \n\nAll of these others wittering on about \"you've known your best friend longer\" are delusional or children, do you really think everyone would rather see your best friend than their actual child/sibling and his wife.", "Have the two met before? Is this the fianc\u00e9s first Christmas dinner with your family? Could put a lot of pressure on the fianc\u00e9. How is your relationship with the new fianc\u00e9? Obviously, you know more about the dynamics here so that could affect whether YTA. \n\nOn a positive, it sounds like you all are all local so it should just be a dinner. Not like they have to spend a week under the same roof.", "NTA ...  you know where I'm going in a few hours , my bfs best friends house who is in a relationship with his ex ,,, and I honestly couldn't care less because I'm not insecure", "Yta, could have had everyone on your side if you would have just shut up in the comments. All you are is a spoiled, tantrum having, mean girl.", "NTA she\u2019s your best friend and your parents are comfortable with her being there obviously. You are not required to cut her out of your life for his new GF. You told them she will be there. I agree she can come or not but since she\u2019s your best friend I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll run into each other often.", "NTA. I do understand your brothers fianc\u00e9e though. It's quite awkward to hang around your husbands ex. But as I see it this year is also a bit of an exception since your best friend didn't have plans with her family which I assume she usually does. 4th of July your brothers fianc\u00e9e have to suck it up though, she can survive one regular occasion and a few irregular ones. As long as your best friend is your best friend that is something your brothers fianc\u00e9e have to live with. It would be different if your best friend was invited to every family occasion.", "put yourself in your FSIL shoes for a second, would you want to spend Christmas with your fianc\u00e9s ex wife? No matter how I see it, YTA. You can always offer to spend the holidays with your friend separately if you really feel bad for her not having anything planned.", "NTA. She\u2019s got some gall telling anyone who they can invite to someone else\u2019s home. If you don\u2019t find a way to put her in her place now her insecurities are going to ruin every family event", "So in 3 years, your bro met his first wife, got engaged, married and divorced, met a new woman, and is now engaged to her? \n\nDoes he have a punch card? Get the 6th wife free?", "NTA she was YOUR BEST FRIEND first. \nFianc\u00e9 is understandably upset but she did know the situation, it\u2019s probably best if they arrange a different Xmas with family and not her if this is going to be a huge issue.", "Quite a definitive YTA.\n\nShould have thought about the fiancee, not yourself. Her first Christmas with your brothers family and you had to set up for discord. Just because your parents agreed doesn't make it right either.\n\nNow there gets to be permanent tension, well done.", "The situation with my brother in law's ex is similar. It's only weird if you make it so - ultimately she's your friend so she'll need to get comfortable with the idea.\n\nIf the marriage only lasted 4 months, I should hope there's no animosity between your bro/friend but sounds like that's the case\n\nNTA", "Yip \u2026. She doesn\u2019t get the power of veto. No offence, but the last marriage lasted four months and he then rushed into the next relationship and engagement. Who knows long this one will last.", "You could aptly address this response to the fianc\u00e9e. She's marrying into a family that had lives, relationships, and family traditions that BF was a part of long before fianc\u00e9e arrived. What kind of insecurity does fianc\u00e9e have that she's threatened by a FOUR MONTH marriage?", "You seem to be missing the bit where OP had a pre-existing relationship with brother\u2019s ex-wife. In the absence of any bad behaviour by the best friend that caused the divorce, there\u2019s no reason to exclude her. Future SIL needs to suck this one up.", "Don't be ridiculous, you think everyone should pick the ex over the fiancee? Because they have known her longer? Including the person she is engaged to? Of course his fiancee gets some veto power, and if he liked the friend so much they would still be married.\n\n If this were the fiancee writing everyone would be saying \"dump him, he needs to stand up for you, he doesn't have your back, you don't have an in-law problem you have a fiance problem\"\n\n(go on down vote me, you will not change my mind)", "Ops brother reminds me of a cousin of me. He\u2019s gotten married 3 times in total. 2 failed marriages, one lasted a few years and the second lasted a few months and he got married again not long after his divorce. Man is nuts .", "FSIL might be uncomfortable at first. I think this sitch is different because the best friend was in the picture before she married brother. If these 2 ladies shake off the idea that they're connected via brother, they may hit it off. They will both be a part of this family in the future, so they should try to get along.", "I agree with this 100% and I really don\u2019t understand the NTA verdict. OP is also risking her relationship with any nieces and nephews she might have in the future pulling shit like this.", "Why would OP do that? It's her best friend and paranoia is leaking on the fianc\u00e9e.", "No, the brother did that by dating her friend to start off with", "Nope the fiancee reeks of insecurity and immaturity lol.", "My exact thought, OP doesn't care about her family and it's an indirect attack toward the new fianc\u00e9. OP is petty, she doesn't care about family, and the ex wife doesn't have any dignity if she goes to dinner.", "Haha so right. \u201cWah my best fwiend wah\u201d. God. FSIl was woman enough to pick up the phone and call this little girl playing games. She\u2019s too good for that whole family.", "Your brother has been with his fianc\u00e9 less than two years (did they know each other prior?)? This all feels so rushed.", "Here\u2019s a thought - since you are besties with Ex and you will be SILs with FSIL, can you create an opportunity for them to meet and get acquainted prior to that day?", "Clearly not as good as you thought.", "Homey is collecting fianc\u00e9s like they\u2019re infinity stones.", "They were best friends before she dated and married her brother", "Absolutely not saying the opposite. I'm saying that OP shouldn't have to neglect her friend, just because she married OP's brother. And I literally said that things like this don't end well. Because the fianc\u00e9e will leave.", "No one is picking one person over another from the sound of it, they're saying both are welcome and one is not allowed to deny the other permission to come. It seems the most adult way to handle things, there's no indication that the ex plans to be rude to the fiancee or \"steal\" her partner back. Why does she need to be banned from the event because the fiancee feels insecure?", "You\u2019re talking about OP\u2019s best friend - the fianc\u00e9e certainty doesn\u2019t get veto power over that.\n\nThey will have to be around each other on many occasions. Fianc\u00e9e will eventually have to accept that. \n\nShe can\u2019t dictate someone else\u2019s guest list.

Idk if it's the SAME fiance here but these stories seems very similar...", "Why? My ex's mom and her ex husband spent holidays together even after their children were grown. My ex's dad's gf was also present. Everyone behaved and had a really nice time. Sure it's not common but it's also not unheard of. When people act maturely it's possible for exes to get along. The ex-wife was best friends with OP long before she married OP's brother. She shouldn't be banned from events just because they had a four month marriage when it appears her and the brother have no ill will towards each other. \n\nMy best friend's mom and her husband let her mom's ex-husband (best friends bio dad) live with them when his health went downhill. They made it work because they were able to move pass the resentment from the divorce. Not everyone hate their ex.
