I told my brother about it to give him a heads up. He didn\u2019t care or mind.

Just because your brother got involved, doesn't mean his fianc\u00e9e now gets veto power.\n\nI understand she's uncomfortable, I would be, too. But she knew the deal, she had to know this would come up at some point. She just assumed that her opinion would weigh more, and it doesn't. Your brother needs to make it clear to her that, ring or no ring, wedding or no wedding, she doesn't get to decide who is family. Especially when everyone else is okay with it.\n\nAn aside, this is the kind of thing we get the other side of on here all the time. New wife upset that the whole family likes the ex better than the new wife, or that the old wife isn't being cut out to make her comfortable. It rarely ends well.", "NTA\n\nAs she's your best friend there are going to be many social situations where both she and your SIL will be invited.  SIL might as well get used to it now before they get married.", "I think most people would be uncomfortable with their partners ex at a family holiday. Different where there is kids involved. I understand the ex is your best friend but not a good start to building a relationship with SIL. You total lack of regards of her feelings in your comments is what makes YTA. I was a bit more understanding before that. I hope your brother considers her feelings and stays away.", "NTA - since your parents and your brother were fine with her being invited then you are NTA. I understand why the finance may be uncomfortable, at least the first couple of times they have to interact, but it doesn't sound like she is going anywhere anytime soon so the fianc\u00e9 will need to work that out for herself.", "NTA\n\nShe was your best friend BEFORE they got together. Most importantly, their marriage was clearly a dumpster fire...it lasted all of 4 months. Your FSIL is being insecure. As someone who's been in her shoes, yes it was uncomfortable, but I was an adult about it. His ex being clearly uncomfortable too made me feel better about my own feelings. At the end of the day, my dude is f'ing with me lol As long as everyone is acting right. Not throwing indirects or mean mugging from across the Xmas table then it should all be good. She should suck it up and attend this time, if some drama goes down ( drama not instigated by herself) then she would be in the right to insist on future holidays excluding the friend.

There nothing wrong with inviting a family friend who's been part of your holidays for years.

Life happens and seldom asks your permission.\" Here's hoping she has the grace to pull up her big girl panties and deal with it.", "NTA - you went to your parents and brother to make sure it was okay.

After reading some of your comments here, it\u2019s obvious you are doing this to spite your FSIL. No one expect you to cut out a friendship because your brother divorced her.

There are no kids involved and there is no reason why she has to spend christmas with her EX and his fiance. \n\nI really hope his fiance see through you and your lack of empathy for her and run fast from this shit show.", "I know I'm going to get downvoted but ESH\n\nI get it, she was your best friend long before she was your SIL and your brothers wife. But now she's also your brothers ex-wife. Some people may associate her with being the ex-wife before they associate her was being your friend. If we're being honest, most people would be uncomfortable finding out their fianc\u00e9 ex wife will be at Christmas when the marriage didn't produce any kids and was very short lived. That's the kinda situation where if you were discuss it with your friends, you'd be wondering, \"where does it end? If she's at Christmas is she going to be at our wedding, his birthday, all family holidays?\" Remember the fianc\u00e9 is still trying to get a feel for your family and her place in it.\n\nYour family and brother may side with you on this family event, and your friend may be welcomed at the fianc\u00e9 discomfort this Christmas. But it would be wise to prepare that everyone may change their opinion and you may find yourself outnumbered next Christmas. Especially post wedding or if they have any kids. If your brothers smart, at very least he will be advocating for his wife over his ex-wife post wedding.", "YTA,\nShe is your friend, I get that, but at the same time, she's your brother's ex wife. The marriage lasted only 4 months. That doesn't make the ex a family. You just created an awkward situation between your brother and his fiancee and yourself. I don't see how the fiancee is supposed to enjoy her time at your parents' Christmas dinner when she knows that her fiance's ex wife is there too. \nYou were also rude to tell her to stay home if she doesn't like it. Even though in the comments you mentioned that your family likes her. \nYou should take some food and snacks and go spend Christmas with the ex wife of your brother if you are that worried for her staying alone. \nOr maybe you are looking for some Christmas drama to happen.", "NAH It's just a bit of a messy situation.\nHopefully FSIL and best friend will meet and get along. Sometimes we have to deal with the fact that we all have a history. \nIf best friend is seen as OP's best friend rather than brother's ex, it'll be fine.

No exs either", "He is now on the path to his second divorce.", "I'm going with YTA.  I suppose you can invite her if you want, and she can show up knowing full well her presence is going to cause problems.\n\nBut you know what?  She changed the dynamic by marrying your brother.   And you're pretty much ensuring that your relationship with your future SIL is going to be poor.  You sound young and I don't think you appreciate how this is going to impact your relationship with your brother and the family dynamics, as your parents are now going to have to pick a side and potentially mess up their relationship with their future DIL.  If these two stay together and have kids things will be strained.\n\nYou can keep your friendship,  but you don't need to ram her into family events.", "NTA", "Since you we\u2019re friends before NTA but really? A family event? Kinda esh take her out dancing, not to a family event.", "Im not sure either way. The best friend aspect has little to do with it in my thought process. In my entire life my best friend nor any of my 9 brothers snd sisters best friend was a though to invite for Christmas. Christmas is the 1 holiday that is all about family. My kids call my best friend uncle and I introduce him as my brother, a d vice versa, but at the end of the day, he isn't family to anybody else other than me. The new wife to be is a priority in this situation. Ex invited to a summer gathering, in OPs wedding, etc IS a friend thing for the EX to be involved.\n\nJust my take. I see that everyone is a bit of the AH.\n\nYou and parents considered your feelings for the beastie but ignored new basic family member. Hubbies considered your feelings but ignored new GF. GF considered herself but ig owed the family dynamic. Overall, eryone lost in some way.", "YTA she might be your best friend but she is also your brother\u2019s ex wife. Of course it\u2019s not ok to invite her for Christmas which is for family- she\u2019s no longer family. Did you do it on purpose?

Your best friend is not part of your family. That's what happens to spouses when they divorce. It is an insult to your brother's fianc\u00e9e to invite his ex-wife. When you invite your brother's ex to a FAMILY holiday, the message that you send the fianc\u00e9e is that you view the ex as the first, better, preferred, true (pick any of those) in-law / family. It makes the fianc\u00e9e feel second class. \n\nI saw this happen for YEARS with my mom and my stepdad. (I refer to my stepdad as dad, and will do so from here on out.) My dad's extended family gave my dad's ex-wife preferential treatment for years. She was always invited to things by his family for years after their divorce. My dad's ex-wife once got a table up front at one of my cousin's wedding while we sat in the back and around the corner where we could see nothing. At this point in time, my mom had been the in-law for nearly 20 years, four times longer than my dad had been married to his ex-wife. Additionally, there was not a very close relationship between my cousin and my dad's ex. Yet, she was still seated near the wedding party with some of my dad's siblings.

If I asked my parents if I could invite my childhood best friend to Christmas dinner because she was spending it alone they would insist that I did. \n\nSometimes being an adult in a relationship means putting aside your own feelings/insecurities. By demanding that OP disinvite her best friend to family activities, fianc\u00e9e is causing a rift in her own relationship with her future husband\u2019s family. She is welcome to have whatever boundaries she chooses but she can\u2019t demand her fianc\u00e9s\u2019 family to abide by them.", "I\u2019m 49.\n\nOP doesn\u2019t have to avoid having her best friend at events, just because the best friend was married for all of 4 months to OP\u2019s brother.\n\nThat relationship was a blip on the radar of life.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e can have her feelings about it, but she needs to realize that the best friend isn\u2019t going away.  \n\nSomeday OP might get married and have her best friend in the wedding party and at any related events.  Birthday parties, cookouts, and any number of social events to come over the years.\n\nEventually it will all be water under the bridge, unless the fianc\u00e9e decides she can\u2019t live with it.", "First off, I asked. I didn\u2019t demand.", "I agree, but it could be that he did find \u201cthe one\u201d this time.  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f we don\u2019t know the whole story, just what we got here.", "Instead of making divorce harder, marriage should be harder to get into.", "That OP\u2019s brother and best friend got married only a year after they started dating, and then quickly realized it was a mistake.  A year really isn\u2019t that much time.", "Friendship, notwithstanding, she\u2019s not family. She is not at most family, gatherings, just the Fourth of July cookout, and then Christmas this year (only due to her own family being unavailable\u2014which is kind of weird)..\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e is now a member of the family and should take priority. The parents should have not have even invited their friend, knowing the situation.  Now, the fianc\u00e9e has to be uncomfortable at Christmas dinner.  If I were her, I would not go.", "Which is why my vote is ESH.", "So you\u2019re ok with your SIL being alone but not your best friend? Wow, that\u2019s terrible", "So? He also told your bff he'd be with her till death do them part lol how'd that turn out?", "You\u2019re so funny OP", "Your SIL asked for you courtesy and understanding too", "That doesn\u2019t prove anything.  More than likely, they ignored a lot of problems and red flags would\u2019ve indicated that the relationship was not viable.\n\nA year is plenty of time to get to know a person, how they deal with conflicts, the type of character they have, and so on.", "I\u2019ll reiterate that being an adult in a relationship sometimes means putting your insecurities aside. From the comments it sounds like she also doesn\u2019t want OP\u2019s friend to go to 4th of July event either. If she can\u2019t spend a couple of hours around a girl that was in a relationship with her fianc\u00e9 years ago then I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s matured enough yet for marriage.\n\nWhy should everyone in the family walk on eggshells? The best friend will be around in some capacity whether the fianc\u00e9e likes it or not. What if OP has a birthday party and invites both of them? Will she not go because the best friend is going too? \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t necessarily agree that her brother proposing to fianc\u00e9e automatically promotes her to family status. It seems that the fianc\u00e9e and OP\u2019s brother haven\u2019t really been together that long. OP might see his fianc\u00e9e as family but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the rest of the family feels the same. Relationships with people grow organically over time.\n\nHer feelings are valid, but she should probably work through them for the sake of her future marriage.", "No, OP\u2019s brothers fianc\u00e9 (they aren\u2019t married yet) *told* her she was being disrespectful, she didn\u2019t ask for any courtesy or understanding. \n\nBtw, OP did check with her brother if he had any issues, which should have included his fianc\u00e9 and if she had any issues too. If OP\u2019s brother didn\u2019t relay that to his fianc\u00e9 or check with her, well that\u2019s something he needs to work on better for the future.", "A year is really no time at all. Maybe when you\u2019re waaay older and have been through some shit and know your dealbreakers and exactly what you need/want in a partner it\u2019s enough time.  But especially with how young the people in the OP are it\u2019s no time at all. A ton of abusive relationships are actually really good the first year and then only start to escalate after that. It\u2019s really really easy to pretend to be someone you\u2019re not for only a year.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair or realistic to question someone\u2019s adulthood for not wanting to be around their partners ex in close proximity at an intimate family gathering.  I think most of the people defending the OP are unrealistic about how they themselves would act in the fianc\u00e9e\u2019s shoes.  \n\nKeep in mind these people are in their mid 20s. That is not exactly the paragon of adulthood. Also, these are not exigent circumstances. The OP did not have to invite the friend over.\n\nIt\u2019s not \u201cwalking on eggshells,\u201d to have common sense, and not invite both your future daughter-in-law, and your son\u2019s ex-wife to the same event.\n\nThe brother proposed, and the fianc\u00e9e accepted. They are engaged to be married and she is now part of the family, your personal opinion not withstanding. From the OP, it looks like they\u2019ve been together at least a year, if not longer.  Either way, I\u2019m not sure that has anything to do with it.", "He absolutely is putting his ex wife over how his future wife feels if he leaves her alone for Christmas.", "Honestly I initially thought the same, then I saw OP\u2019s comments about how she won\u2019t allow her brother to *let* SIL uninvite her from the wedding in February. And the brother will attend the Xmas dinner with or without SIL. \n\nThat really rubbed me the wrong way.", "A year is plenty of time. Where is your evidence that \u201ca ton\u201c of abusive relationships are really good the first year? I\u2019ve gotten to this debate with a lot of people who try to claim that abusers hide their abuse until they have their victim trap. Nevertheless, I have not seen any evidence of it.\n\nI think a lot of people, women in particular, ignore the red flags due to their emotional investment. But the signs are always there. \n\nBut we are in agreement that the older one gets, the more insight they have about relationships.", "If you\u2019re talking about [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/sCsA1JXOEC) comment, it sounds to me like OP\u2019s brothers fianc\u00e9 wanted to uninvited OP and he put his foot down. \n\nIMO, OP did her due diligence by checking with her parents then her brother before inviting her friend. If OP\u2019s brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 would have had an issue with it, that is his responsibility to check with his fianc\u00e9 and not OP."]}
