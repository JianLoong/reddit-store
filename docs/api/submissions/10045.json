I apologized to DD as soon as she got home. Then we had a therapeutic conversation between us, respectfully, and we talked about why she has respect for other adults but not Mom. She opened up, though it was hard and explained. We both agreed that we have some work to do, and we both agreed to donthe work. We created a code word \"taco \" for when we need a safe space to tell one another that we've hurt the other. I told her that she could tell me anything that I have said or done that has made her feel like I don't deserve respect and I wouldn't get mad. We talked again about the possibility of an underlying BH diagnosis that we are missing and I pointed out how much it has helped brother that he has a diagnosis and she agreed that she would be open to talking to a BH psychologist, she agrees it might be aspergers as she really struggles to understand or express emotion and that me being a very sensitive person makes it hard to understand/ connect with me. She also said that she feels we have a good relationship and that because she's more comfortable spending time with me that she doesn't find herself in these situations with other adults because she doesn't really spend time with them,  so it's not that she doesn't respect me specifically but that she spends most of her time with me over anyone else except her friends, so naturally we have more opportunities to get on each other's nerves or hurt each other. We agreed she would be in charge of the bathroom and her own laundry going forward and for now without allowance. We will revisit allowance after a few months. We worked it out and I am grateful for the advice of those who actually listened to and wanted to understand the situation before offering advice or passing judgement. Thank you all \ud83d\ude0a\n\n\n***Edited to add.  Many of you are asking the same questions please make sure you are reading through my responses to others before posting your question. I have read through everyone's thoughts on the matter and I have been given some great ideas to try. I will be apologizing for what I said to my daughter when she gets home from school And we will discuss a different  Chore for her to do at home and we will discuss that for now she will not be getting an allowance. Thank you to everyone who was kind and understanding that we as parents do not always have the answer. I appreciate everyone's responses but will no longer be responding to anyone on this thread.\n\nMy (35 f) daughter (12)  Has over the course of the last 2 years thrown away several of my things with feigned incompetence and just laziness. I pay her $80 a month to clean the kitchen. She has thrown away all of my spoons because she didn't pay attention, and even after getting talked to several times about it, as the spoons were slowly disappearing, it didn't stop. I had to buy a whole new set of silverware just to replace the spoons. Then the exact same thing happened with the forks. Then she threw away an entire brand new baby dress that I bought for my niece just a few days ago, and I kind of lost it. She is not the only one that does this. Her brother, who is autistic, has also thrown away hundreds of dollars worth of medication because he was not paying attention to what was in the bag before he threw the bag Away when cleaning the living room. She has watched me search through garbage bags and the giant bin outside while crying my eyes out over the loss of the more expensive things and had no remorse or guilt. I have been having some really serious health issues, and the stress of this, on top of other behavioral issues she has presented, has not helped with my health problems. Yesterday was Valentine's Day, and she spent $25 of her own money on a really pretty flower for her girlfriend, and she and I have excitedly talked about it back-and-forth. She was looking forward to giving it to her girlfriend on Valentine's Day, but her girlfriend was not at school. This morning, after finding an entire roll of paper towels in the trash (I don't even know how she used the whole roll, most of the towels were still completely white dry and unused) was the last straw and I lost it. I took the flower and hit it in the closet. When she went to grab it before school and couldn't find it, I acted cold and uncaring like she does and told her maybe it got thrown away. I let her search through the trash bags but didn't make it go as far as the bin. She was stressed, crying, getting angry at the injustice of it all (This is the way she has made me feel so many times) and started screaming about how she spent $25 on that flower. I told her \"this is how I felt when you threw away the dress, when you threw away ALL of the spoons and ALL of the forks and entire rolls of paper towels more than once and you didn't care at all when you saw me crying and stressing over it, but unlike you I care and I love you and I would never actually throw something of yours away out of laziness\" and I grabbed the flower and gave it to her. She stormed out and called me a garbage human being.", "created_utc": 1676486059, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11351iq/aita_for_pretending_to_throw_away_my_daughters/", "score": 534, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I had this problem with my kid, and talked to a group about it and was shocked to discover how many parents also had vanishing flatware. I don't think it's carelessness as in accidentally throwing flatware away, I think it's not wanting to wash it. \n\nWhen I wasn't able to reach my kiddo about this by just explaining that I was sick of buying more flatware, and didn't feel like spending time yelling about spoons, I started keeping a couple of place setting's worth in my room (clean, of course) and stopped replacing it in the kitchen. When we ran out of flatware, I told him he was welcome to replace it. I washed my own and put it back in my room after meals.\n\nHe replaced it (he was a pretty good little saver and had plenty of his pocket money saved up) but continued to lose it for a little while, but by six or eight weeks later the flatware count had stabilized and it hasn't been an issue since.\n\nNTA.

I also did not get upset about him and the post is not about that, The post is about my daughter but was merely pointing out that the additional stress from the fact that her brother has also done this has caused this to be a sensitive topic in my house. \n\nAs far as therapy goes, her father and I have put her in therapy several times, but it never works because when she is not at home, she is the perfect child. She is an  A plus student school, and when she meets with a therapist, it's just the perfect example of a child and doesn't actually open up or allow anyone in to provide therapy.  We have tried 4 different therapists since she was 8 years old, and none of them were able to get anywhere with her because she would not open up to them. Her dad and I also do not live together, but we do get along, and we coparent peacefully. However, I'm struggling as a single mom of 2, with 1 of them being special needs, and he doesn't struggle as much . So he pays her an exorbitant amount of money for good grades and her chores, and I have to compete with that. because she knows that she is going to get money regardless. It kind of took away the only motivation that she had to do chores at my house at all. Also, 12 years old is not too young to clean one room out of the entire house. And the reason she was given the kitchen specifically instead of any other chore was  Because of behavior issues before and her therapist actually advised that I give her the kitchen because she was extremely rude and condescending to me and tearing me down as a single mom because I sometimes had dishes in the sink when I didn't have time to get to them. The thought was that if she understood how long it takes to clean the kitchen as well as work a full time job and have to do the laundry and clean the bathroom et cetera et cetera that she would be more understanding . That was when she was around 9, so the kitchen has been her chore since she was 9 years old, and I have repeatedly shown her how to clean the kitchen appropriately.  Also this has been going on for about 2 years now and the forks and spoons disappeared slowly overtime whether they were in food containers that were from fast food or whatever I don't know how she was throwing them away. She has also thrown away other utensils like spatula's and mashed potato masher et cetera and I've had to replace them. She has broken my ice machine twice And things like that period so this is an ongoing issue that I have tried talking to her about and even taking away her money but it has had no effect. So to emphasize what happened this morning was  A last ditch resort to try to show her what it feels like since she seems to not care how it was affecting me", "NTA\n\nBegin deducting things from her 'salary'.

I don't hit my kids. Positive reinforcement (allowance) and negative reinforcement (having allowance taken away as well as being grounded) have been used. I have tried everything I could think of. I know that this mornings response was emotional,  I will talk to her again after school.  And yes, I actively parent, and it's clear to all of her teachers and her previous therapists that I have done what I can. I have read parenting books and taken parenting classes. Which is more than I can say for most patents, so no, I'm not sitting around making my kids do everything while doing nothing.  I'm giving my kids responsibility and trying to instill independence and life skills in them. One day, they will live on their own and have to clean their whole house themselves. When she was younger, I supervised cleaning (like I do for son every day) but she's had the same chore for 4 years. She shouldn't still need supervision.

She is incredibly intelligent and mature for her age,  She may have ADHD or be on the spectrum, but she will not open up to any therapist to try to get a diagnosis we tried for years. The fact that she has never accidentally thrown away anything of hers or her brothers and it's directly related to a chore that she doesn't want to do to me makes it clear that it's weaponized in competence. She doesn't want to clean it, so she throws it away. We've talked about it repeatedly, she's watched me cry and stress while looking through all the garbage bags and even the large bin.  She never seemed moved or bothered by the fact that it upset me so much which is partially why I approached the situation the way I did this morning because  I thought if she could feel what it felt like then maybe she would be more understanding in the future. Since she  Shown any sort of remorse or guilt when she sees me suffering, I thought maybe she needed to feel it instead of just see or here about it. And I understand that I may be wrong in that, but I am only a human, and we do make mistakes as parents. I have read through all of the comments and taken into consideration everything everyone has said. I will be talking to her when she gets home and apologizing for what I said, talking about how it made her feel and how that is how I have felt several times.

Then she threw away an entire brand new baby dress that I bought for my niece just a few days ago, and I kind of lost it. She is not the only one that does this. Her brother, who is autistic, has also thrown away hundreds of dollars worth of medication because he was not paying attention to what was in the bag before he threw the bag Away when cleaning the living room. She has watched me search through garbage bags and the giant bin outside while crying my eyes out over the loss of the more expensive things and had no remorse or guilt. I have been having some really serious health issues, and the stress of this, on top of other behavioral issues she has presented, has not helped with my health problems. Yesterday was Valentine's Day, and she spent $25 of her own money on a really pretty flower for her girlfriend, and she and I have excitedly talked about it back-and-forth. She was looking forward to giving it to her girlfriend on Valentine's Day, but her girlfriend was not at school. This morning, after finding an entire roll of paper towels in the trash (I don't even know how she used the whole roll, most of the towels were still completely white dry and unused) was the last straw and I lost it. I took the flower and hit it in the closet. When she went to grab it before school and couldn't find it, I acted cold and uncaring like she does and told her maybe it got thrown away. I let her search through the trash bags but didn't make it go as far as the bin. She was stressed, crying, getting angry at the injustice of it all (This is the way she has made me feel so many times) and started screaming about how she spent $25 on that flower. I told her \"this is how I felt when you threw away the dress, when you threw away ALL of the spoons and ALL of the forks and entire rolls of paper towels more than once and you didn't care at all when you saw me crying and stressing over it, but unlike you I care and I love you and I would never actually throw something of yours away out of laziness\" and I grabbed the flower and gave it to her.

So I have tried to just go at it myself when she's at my house. I have tried to get her to do therapy but she gives very minimal responses it's hard to explain to someone who isn't in the situation.

Now you know there are other possible causes, that makes the accusation a mistake, and an opportunity for you to demonstrate to your daughter how you fix mistakes.\n\nYour next step is to figure out the cause of your daughter's behavior. r/ADHD has links to a 3 hour long YouTube presentation by Russell A. Barkley. Within the first 10 minutes you will know if ADHD is a possibility, and if so the next hours will be extremely valuable information.\n\nEdit: Direct link to the presentation https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhbAK1pdPM&list=PLzBixSjmbc8eFl6UX5_wWGP8i0mAs-cvY\n\nEdit 2: ADHD is just a guess.

She doesn't want to clean it so she throws it away. We've talked about it repeatedly, she's watched me cry and stress while looking through all the garbage bags and even the large bin.  She never seemed moved or bothered by the fact that it upset me so much which is partially why I approached the situation the way I did this morning because  I thought if she could feel what it felt like then maybe she would be more understanding in the future.

I understand that what I said was inappropriate and I will apologize for that as I always do when I have been in the wrong in the past because I do sit down and have open discussions with my children on a regular basis And when I am in the wrong I always apologize.

She was showing me some videos on her camera and accidentally clicked on a video where she is recording herself in the shorts talking about how ugly they were and how I was so stupid for buying her these shorts because they are so ugly and how could anyone wear these outside of the house . Basically mocking me and making fun of me, then in the video she walks into the kitchen where there are maybe 7 or 8 dishes and talks about how I'm so disgusting and dirty that I don't even clean our house. I discussed the video with her therapist at the time , and the solution the 3 of us came up with together was that she would clean the kitchen. She tried to pull away when the video 1st started playing but that was  A red flag so I grabbed the camera and watched the rest of the video and I was heartbroken at the way she talked about me and the things that I do for her. Our house is relatively clean for Me doing it all by myself and at the time I worked in a different city than we lived in so I was literally gone 16 hours A-day, and sometimes I didn't have time to get to the dinner dishes because I had to bathe and put her brother to bed.

My daughter didn't like her at all but even if she had the therapist kept forgetting to pull her from class for therapy on Mondays when she was supposed to have it. She pulled her 3 times Over the course of 6 months. So we fired her too. She had a counselor when she was 6-7 who was a family counselor and did counseling for both me and her and sometimes us together. I got a lot out of those canceling sessions but she didn't. The only things that she would talk about were the things that we went through with my ex before I left.  And then once she got it off her chest she just talked about silly fun things after that and never opened up. The counselor felt like we were both doing fine and released us from care. She also saw a therapist that was a woman in her 30s. I really liked her but she released us because my daughter was making no progress.  She wouldn't get into anything deep. She would always report things as if she had a 100%happy/ perfect life with no problems ever. The therapist said she may need to see someone else because she felt they weren't bonding. Dad then said no more therapy,  she's fine.", "Yeah me too, i've read some comments about her maybe having ADHD or other thing like autism, even if she did this wouldnt be coming from that imo, I have ADHD and it doesnt make me throw spoons and be mean to my mom \u2620\ufe0f", "It's not something I planned on happening.  Do you buy extra sets of silverware in case someone throws them all away? It was a slow progression,she didn't toss the whole lot at once.

I believed her at first until the same thing happened with the forks.", "Here is what OP says about the brother:\n\n>Her brother, who is autistic, has also thrown away hundreds of dollars worth of medication because he was **not paying attention to what was in the bag before he threw the bag Away** when cleaning the living room. \n\nSo it's not like he went through the house throwing away meds, he threw away things that looked like garbage without going through it first.  I assumed it was the same with the daughter, that the cutlery was left in old lunch bags, takeout containers, etc. and that was how it got thrown away.", "Seems like son gets help for being neurodivergent but daughter doesn't get help because she is intelligent and mature for her age.

Her behavior is odd.", "I had constantly disappearing forks and spoons as well -- and it turned out to be my (now ex) husband, who had a compulsive eating disorder.\n\nHe was buying large tins of ravioli, or spagettio's or chili -- things like that.  He didn't even heat them up.  He'd open the can, eat the entire contents in one go, and then hide the evidence in a closet in his man-cave-room.\n\nHe'd eventually throw out a can or two, but it would have a cemented-spoon or fork attached to the can's dried-out and crusty contents, and he'd toss the entire thing rather than remove and wash the cutlery.\n\nEvery once in a great while I'd find a tin with a crusty chili covered spoon in it and I'd yell at him for both wasting the food budget on eating an entire can by himself, AND throwing away the dried up cutlery.\n\nIt wasn't until we split and I literally moved him out that I learned the extent of his disorder.\n\nI learned this after I decided I had to move him out of the house.  \n\nI paid for an apartment for him for one month, and, when he was out of the house for an entire day (rare), I packed up all of his personal stuff and put it in a uhaul and drove it to an apartment and moved it all in.  I then took him out to dinner and gave him his keys and I said \"you live here fully paid for one month -- after that, where you live is up to you\" -- but it's not at my house (which I was paying for).\n\nI learned about the disorder when I cleaned out his spare bedroom (I'd kicked him out of the primary bedroom a long time before) and man cave area, and the closets -- my God --- the evidence of his food compulsion and the dozens and dozens of crusty hidden spoons in forks inside of take-out boxes and empty cans and wrappers.  Incredible.  \n\nSo.

Were you divorced at the time?? That's pretty extreme behaviour for someone so young, and I find it really odd that she only does this at home.

I don't know what kind of credentials your current therapist for her has, but if you can afford it, I would consider a psychiatrist or someone trained to deal with more extreme behaviours in children like this. Speaking from experience, it's going to get worse as she gets older, especially after puberty hits. Definitely get your husband more involved as well! There shouldn't be any reason why you're struggling more than he is with both kids.", "How bad is your therapist that their response was that she didn\u2019t appreciate how hard it is to keep a house clean rather than pointing out that she was obviously acting out because she was getting approximately zero attention from you?", "Well yeah I bought replacements lol.", "Yes, I have been a single mom since brother was a newborn and she was 5 and a half.

She has not had success in therapy.  She does, however,   Improve her behavior at home in order to avoid going to therapy. Her dad is the type that feels that she only needs to be in therapy if she's having current problems and consistent therapy isn't something that he feels as necessary. Hes very old fashioned in his thinking on a lot of things. He also feels that because she gets good grades in school and doesn't really cause any trouble outside of the home that she doesn't need therapy. At his house she spends nearly all of her time in her room and so does everyone who lives there. They have an avoid an attachment style I guess at his house and there's really nothing I can do about that. over here I try to be involved in her life as much as she will let me,  And we've talked about her mental health a lot especially as she's gotten older. We've even talked about the possibility that she may have aspergers or what they used to call  Asperger's because she has trouble understanding how other people's emotions come about or how her actions can affect other people's emotions. She doesn't like to talk about stuff like that but she has opened up a little bit more as she's gotten older. I've gotten a lot of hate in this thread from people who don't understand just how much time and effort I've put into her and how much I absolutely love and adore her Or how much we've talked about this together just the 2 of us and how I'm the only one that she's actually opened up to at all about the possibility that she might be on the spectrum she won't open up to any professional.

We did cover how my being gone so much was affecting the children, but as a single mom, I had to work. I didn't have a choice.

I did eventually switch jobs closer to home, and now I work from home so that I can be home with the kids.

This entire comment section reeks of bad parenting.", "Does your son get extra support? Do you think she might be acting out out of jealousy or a bid for attention because of it? She may notice that she gets different reactions than he does for the same behavior and that could be an issue for her. She also sounds a lot like I was as a kid. The perfect child outside the house, but loses their shit when they get home. It is really really common for autistic/adhd girls because they spend the whole day masking, people pleasing, and trying to understand everybody else so they are exhausted and inevitably going to lash out and meltdown in their comfort zone at home. I and many other neurodivergent women are also also highly sensitive and emotional, but if you were to have put me in front of a stranger to have them evaluate me or do what I would perceive as trying to fix me for my parents, I also 100% would have shut down and revealed nothing. Not saying that this is the case for her obviously, but if one family member is neurodivergent, odds are someone else in the family is too. I think that\u2019s why a lot of people in the comments bring up your son, because maybe his sister is also autistic. Autistic girls get overlooked very frequently. It is pretty interesting behavior to repeatedly throw someone\u2019s things away. Almost like it\u2019s impulsive or some kind of experiment to see who notices, what she can get away with, what the reaction will be, etc.. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a complete asshole for teaching her a lesson, but it might be worth trying to figure out and understand why she is acting out. It makes a big difference to approach the situation from a place of wanting to understand, rather than to simply teach a lesson. Sorry for the long winded post.

(it's a common comorbidity with autism) The \"emotionlessness\" can just be the lack of physical expression of emotions unless they're super strong, so she might have been distressed at you looking through the trash but not be able to or know how to show it. As for ADHD, careless mistakes and being forgetful of things are super common and not on purpose. Also, having to do things with little to no reward can make it physically hard to do anything. For outsiders it sounds like we're just lazy, but it's actually a very real mental blockage. You should consider other rewards for chores and make sure you thank her when she actually gets it done so there's positive emotions attached. There's whole websites and books about positive reinforcement and so many methods, I'm sure you will figure something out. And, of course, talk to her to figure out what she enjoys and wants.\n\nOverall I would *definitely* recommend getting her checked for both, as both have a genetic factor and can show differently in girls so may easily be missed. And read up about them yourself, too. Preferably from media that was written by people that are actually autistic or have ADHD, so you can get a look at the inside of their minds and understand them.\n\nThere's a chance it might not be at all what's going on, but that's just what it looks like to me, and checking doesn't hurt anyone.", "If not giving her money doesn\u2019t mean anything to her, just take away privileges.
