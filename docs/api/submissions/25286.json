{"id": 25286, "submission_id": "15yi1bd", "title": "AITA for telling my mom and sister to leave me and my wife alone?", "selftext": "I (27m) am married to my wife Sara (27f). We have been together for six years and married for 3. My parents are divorced and have remarried. When I was 18 my mom had moved to France with my stepfather because he had been offered a job there.\n\nBefore my mom had left I was dating Jessica and my mom loved her like her own. She and my sister were best friends and that's how we became close. We went to separate colleges. I thought our long distance relationship was going well until my junior year of college when matt who goes to the same school as her, sent me a picture of her kissing two guys at a party. I sent her the picture and said we were over.\n\nSara was my rock through it all. We had been really good friends and met in college, then after the Jessica situation we became closer and even though my dad said it wasn't good to hop right into a relationship, I did anyways and been happy ever since. \n\nBecause of Covid, my mom couldn't come to the wedding but they gift us a large property they had left before they moved.\n\nThis year they moved back to the US and moved to with us while they found another house. So I threw a party to welcome them back, my dad and mom left off on really good terms so him and his wife were invited as well. For some reason my mom invited Jessica. I didn't even know that they were still in touch.\n\nMy dad asked me if Sara was okay with this but I said I wasn't sure why she was here. She came up to me, hugged me and ignored Sara so I introduced her to my wife. Sara shook her hand and asked does she want a beer. She made a off handed comment about her real women don't drink beer and asked for a glass of champagne. Now to mention, Sara is the definition of a tomboy, she drinks beer, fishes, works on cars as a hobby. It was also weird that Jessica came dressed to a backyard bbq in heels and a dress you'd wear to the club.\n\nMy wife never takes anything seriously and just laughed in her face. I couldn't help but laugh either. Jessica got really mad and my mom walked over to see what happened. Jessica told her what just occurred and even though my wife and I were both laughing she began yelling at Sara and told her to leave and give me and Jessica some time to catch up. I told her to watch her mouth and not talk to my wife that way and that if Jessica has a problem she needs to leave. \n\nMy dad asked my mom why is she behaving like this. My mom just pulled me inside the house to talk with Jessica. My mom said my wife but dresses like a man. (She doesn't. Think of lynette from desperate housewives) She said jessica is a feminine women who would take care of a man. I told my mom the problem is that she would take care of too many men. Jessica said I was shaming her for a mistake she made years ago and now she has changed. Jessica ran out crying and my mom said she would take the house back if I didn't leave sara for jessica. My sister then yelled at me for being inconsiderate of her friend. I told them to leave my wife alone.

I have to ask though: is your mother mentally unstable by any chance?

That's such a load of bullshit. I hope that that property is ironclad in your name, though. But I would go low to no contact with your mom and sister so they get the point that you mean business, and then if you decide to let them back in your life, then you can tell them they can never speak ill of your wife to her, to you, or to anyone else, and if you hear otherwise, you're done with them.

Your mom is a real piece of work for inviting your cheating ex to YOUR house without telling you, and then threatening to take back the house she gifted you if you don\u2019t leave your wife for Jessica.

OP has to stop his mother\u2019s behavior immediately.  No gray areas here.  Insult Sara and the result will be a time-out - a defined period of NC.  Another insult, either a longer time-out or permanent NC.\n\nBy the way, Sara sounds delightful!  As for Jessica, the idea she wouldn\u2019t hesitate to go after a married man... you dodged a bullet.

They were discussing jessica. Idk how you took out from that that he doesn't love his wife", "Don\u2019t hurt yourself trying to reach", "Apparently not very well if it has been 6 years and she is still single and hanging around the ex-boyfriend's mom.

But that being his only excuse, I found it a tad crummy.", "I agree she is an AH, as well as his mom, but that excuse was weak.", "Did you expect him to respond with a novel?", "His response was obviously to be petty and call her out on cheating. It seems like you\u2019re purposefully misconstruing his excuse to make it seem like he doesn\u2019t love his wife, which is something no one is questioning seeing as he married her and defended her", "How about \"I love my wife\"? Too complicated? Again, I agree that his mom and the other lady were AHs.", "It's something that doesn't even need a reply. It's a question that is answered by kicking them both out of the bbq."]}
