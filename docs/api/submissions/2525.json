Please don\u2019t listen to those saying otherwise. \n\nFor those calling OP TA, shame on you. Do look into an anxiety disorder called pedophobia. It\u2019s the fear of small children and babies.

Being around one let alone being pressured to hold one can trigger a shit ton of anxiety and it\u2019s completely involuntary. It\u2019s not unlike having an irrational fear of bugs, heights, large bodies of water, etc. Imagine someone who is supposed to love you pressuring you into something they *know* will make you extremely uncomfortable and then call you an asshole when you freak out about it. Sure, it may be an irrational fear but it\u2019s still very real. \n\nI have pedophobia. I\u2019m a woman married to a man in the military. Military families tend to procreate quickly and often, so I\u2019m surrounded by people my own age who have at least two kids, and going to certain functions involving all those kids is my own personal hell. If my husband ever tried to force me to hold a baby and have the nerve to call me an asshole when I refused and/or freaked out (and justifiably got upset at him for even thinking about it), I would not only be extremely angry at him but I would be deeply hurt that he didn\u2019t give enough of a shit about my own feelings before trying to force that on me. \nSo, from the bottom of my heart, shame on any of you who call OP TA over something he can\u2019t control. \n\nAnd for the issue calling the baby \u201cit.\u201d If you\u2019re doing it on purpose, maybe stop doing that.

You\u2019re not TA for doing that every now and then but don\u2019t do it on purpose just to piss people off. \n\nAs a side note, I truly believe your girlfriend tried to pressure you into liking kids by doing what she did. You need to sit her down and talk to her. You seem to have made it adamantly clear that you want nothing to do with children and she could have been trying to manipulate you into changing your mind.
