That's a whole big can of worms you don't need to be opening. If Greg wants to live with his girlfriend, he needs to find his own place.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to be a people pleaser. Also, a girl living with you could have been the violation of the uni rules. With consequences.", "NTA\n\nYou have a right to not have strangers move in with you. And is this university housing? If so, chances are she wouldn't be allowed to live there anyway.", "NTA. You signed on with certain (very reasonable) expectations. Greg was probably surprised that he can\u2019t always have his way, and sometimes plans just don\u2019t work out. Good luck with your next roommate!", "NTA, not your circus, not your monkeys. He wants to ruin his life with some chick he barely knows, that\u2019s on him, not you.", "NTA. It's one thing for a flatmate's partner to spend the night or weekend occasionally, but the fact that you were assigned to live with a stranger who casually informs you that he is inviting another stranger to cohabitate WHOM HE HAS ALSO NEVER MET IRL is beyond weird.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your problem if he needed a roommate he could as well have stayed with his girlfriend instead of getting a roommate and let his girlfriend stay with him rent free. \nAlso I doubt they would allow such a thing in your contract and you are allowed to not want some stranger to live in your house. You didn\u2019t sign up for this.", "NTA. You don't really know these people -your roommate you've only lived with a few months, and all of a sudden he wants to move his girlfriend (who HE hasn't even met in person yet plans to marry) in for 3 months? Frankly, Greg sounds like he's being taken for a ride, but that's his problem. Your problem would be living with a total stranger for 3 months, assuming Greg's plans even work out.  I wouldn't do it either, and at this point you're well rid of Greg.", "Most university housing will have policies against this and it\u2019s really inappropriate to ask your new roommate to share the space with someone not on the lease/housing agreement. NTA", "NTA. Aren't there rules with uni housing about who can & can't be in your place? Because he could very well have been breaking the rules. And endangering your housing too. Sounds like you dodged a bullet here.", "NTA! Sounds like Greg moving out in a week saved you potential drama down the road if his gf staying with yall turned out to be an issue.", "NTA. This is university housing. I don't think you usually CAN consent to that, even if it hadn't been a hot mess situation. There are a bunch of policies that aren't negotiable there. No matter what, NTA. That sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.", "NTA.\n\nGreg's domestic situation is not your problem. If he had intentions of moving in and marrying his gf, he should not have accepted university accommodations for a roommate.\n\nIt's weird enough moving in with a perfect stranger when you go to college. No way that I'd be comfortable moving in with a stranger then the stranger's gf/soon to be wife when I don't know either of them. You dodged a bullet here, OP.", "NTA - good on you for sticking up for yourself.  everyone wants to be liked, but this type of compromise has \"problem\" written all over it - it would no longer be your room.  when you get a new roommate, don't hesitate to set up clear boundaries, one of which should be very,  very clear boundaries on guests.", "NTA - I think you dodged a bullet, it's fine he moves out rather than youdeal with the ensuing drama. When you are asked it's ok to say no.", "This was an utterly unreasonable request and you were right to say no. If he's moving out who cares if he's upset with you?

Absolutely no good would have come to you if she had moved in, guaranteed.", "NTA", "It\u2019s easy to tell from the title that your NTA", "NTA. You dodged a bullet.", "NTA He searched a place just for himself knowing that he wants to move in with his gf?! Just no! He has a room for one person, he can't just move in another person. Especially since it is pretty much against the housing rules. Why didn't they searched a place for two?! And they are just so shortly together, so there will be lots of drama. Nope. \n\nLook in the lease how often he can have guest over. Not that she will be over 6 out of the 7 days of the week...", "NTA. Greg was basically asking you to house some random woman he didn't even know himself.

You barely know him and he's asking for a complete stranger that he's never met to move in.  Hell no.", "It definitely would have been, should have mentioned that in my post", "Yep, not allowed. We can have guests stay for four nights consecutively. Greg did not seem to understand lol", "Really good point, he didn\u2019t even mention her paying. He definitely didn\u2019t consider it as a disruption to me at all.", "It's university managed off campus grad student housing. Basically just an apartment.", "Consider Greg moving out a blessing.", "NTA. You were sane for not letting her stay. He is insane for considering this arrangement. Not only is she a stranger to you, she is a stranger to him.", "Nuclear bomb dodged!", "There's literally no conflict here", "NTA Don't ever do that. I let my new roommate's boyfriend stay once, just short term. \"What could it hurt if he stays for a week while he gets back on his feet?\" I thought. Roommate turned out to be an awful person who takes advantage of any amount of kindness shown to her, and 9 months later, he was still there, not paying rent/utilities, eating my food. So not worth it.", "Who cares if he's mad? She's not part of your roommate assignment, you didn't have the authority to give him permission anyway!", "NTA He asks to move his gf in on the first day you met? Oh boy. He has only know the girl a couple months? Oh boy or boy. A single person rooming with a couple is a bad idea because they will gang up on you reinforcing their rules on you, two against one. Never a good idea. it doesn't matter if you upset him. Logic comes before someone else's hurt feelings. You cannot make decisions based on not upsetting someone. You cannot please all people all of the time. they best you can do is not try to please people, but make the best decisions you can for the moment and for your own well being and future.", "So i just heard something on some sub that applies to your situation and i think it\u2019s important and succinctly written.

My roommate moved her boyfriend into our 1 room dorm \"temporarily\" (for 2 months) and it was terrible. He was always there when I returned, in fact he would get excited at hearing the door open and then disappointed when he saw it was me and not his girlfriend lol, when they fought it was awkward, and I always was the third wheel listening in on their conversations and such. Would not recommend.", "NTA\n\nA three month stay, they met online, never in person, and they're planning to get married?? Giant Red Flag.\n\nYou dodged a bullet,  thank God he's moving out.", "NTA - sounds like you dodged a bullet! I hope the new roomie is more compatible!", "NTA. He wants her to shack up with him in university housing? (Ugh tell me it's not just a shared bedroom dorm room, I need to read those words)\n\nYes this whole thing sounds weird. Him moving out = bullet dodged, sounds like.", "NTA  \n\n\nThat was sudden. And risky. Good on you for saying \"No.\"", "You are not the AH.  That situation would be weird for anyone.", "This means you doged a bullet\n\nNTA", "NTA.  He has a mail order bride who he has never met and he expects you to have her live there.  Nope, not ever.  Tell him if he wants a gf to move in, he needs to find elsewhere to live.  I would also report him to the university as trying to move another person in with you.", "NTA. Smart move, OP. NEVER let someone move their random partner in. You can consider it if: 1) you know the person, 2) they've been together for awhile, 3) the place is big enough, and 4) the partner plans to share all the bills.\n\nYou dodged a massive bullet. It's also clear this guy always planned to move the girl in.", "Way to stand your ground. You dodged multiple bullets, both by denying Greg's request and living with him in general. If he thought his request was suitable to make, imagine what else he'd ask for in the future.", ">Greg has since stopped interacting with me and is moving out in a week.\n\nThat is good for you, OP. Don't worry about it. This wasn't something you should have said yes to.", "Nta", "NTA. And what nerve he\u2019s got springing that on a brand new roommate! Unbelievable. Imagine - they\u2019ve never met in person, and they\u2019re planning to get married within 3 months? This guy is some sort of dummkopf! You dodged a bullet, my friend. He can take his drama elsewhere. Good luck!", "Yeah, it is all kinds of strange. Let him be a blip in your history, and find yourself a new roommate.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You *hopefully* dodged a bullet depending on if he moves out as promised.", "NTA, you were to get one roommate, not two. You\u2019d be a third wheel in your own apartment.", "He\u2019s moving out? In a week? That\u2019s a win win. You know how many people who\u2019ve had bad roommates and had to forcibly spend months with them. You are extremely lucky the problem is taking itself out", "And they're going to get married too. After knowing her for a few months. And she's only supposed to live there for three months. And they will get married during those three months.\n\nSooo... he's going to marry this girl after 7 months of knowing her, at best, and wants to break the rules for housing in the process. Did he knock up his one night stand or something?\n\nOP could find a worse roommate, but it would probably take some effort.", "Oh, I'm sure he understood perfectly well - he was planning on ignoring that rule (and you). Glad you avoided those twin headaches.", "Then Greg isn't smart enough for uni.", "NTA - I let my (estranged) sister stay with my family recently. Worst six months of my life. Don't let strangers in unless you can easily get rid of them.", "NTA", "Has he never watched Catfish?  Is he really going to move out for someone he has never met in person?", "Good point, if anything I\u2019d think he would have asked for permission before moving in if he wanted to be respectful", "Good point. I could invision many more \"requests\" in the future. Better to nip this one in the bud now. Good for you.", "NTA\nBe glad he's your ex roomate. He could have gotten you in trouble for breaking uni rules.", "NTA. You've dodged a bullet. Congratulations.", "NTA", "NTA. Is his girlfriend even from your country. You don't need Greg and his 90 day fianc\u00e9.", "No", "NTA sign up for a new roommate you don\u2019t want all that drama on your plate", "Yeah this brings up a whole different point honestly. It doesn't really add up lol.", "No she's not. They're apparently planning on moving back to their home country around the end of the year.", "Definitely made the right call, but this could have been amazing drama and stories for years. Imagine all the dumb shit Greg gets up to."]}
