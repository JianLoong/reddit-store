That's a whole big can of worms you don't need to be opening. If Greg wants to live with his girlfriend, he needs to find his own place.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to be a people pleaser. Also, a girl living with you could have been the violation of the uni rules. With consequences.", "NTA\n\nYou have a right to not have strangers move in with you. And is this university housing? If so, chances are she wouldn't be allowed to live there anyway.", "NTA. You signed on with certain (very reasonable) expectations. Greg was probably surprised that he can\u2019t always have his way, and sometimes plans just don\u2019t work out. Good luck with your next roommate!", "NTA, not your circus, not your monkeys. He wants to ruin his life with some chick he barely knows, that\u2019s on him, not you.", "NTA. It's one thing for a flatmate's partner to spend the night or weekend occasionally, but the fact that you were assigned to live with a stranger who casually informs you that he is inviting another stranger to cohabitate WHOM HE HAS ALSO NEVER MET IRL is beyond weird.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your problem if he needed a roommate he could as well have stayed with his girlfriend instead of getting a roommate and let his girlfriend stay with him rent free. \nAlso I doubt they would allow such a thing in your contract and you are allowed to not want some stranger to live in your house. You didn\u2019t sign up for this.", "NTA. You don't really know these people -your roommate you've only lived with a few months, and all of a sudden he wants to move his girlfriend (who HE hasn't even met in person yet plans to marry) in for 3 months? Frankly, Greg sounds like he's being taken for a ride, but that's his problem. Your problem would be living with a total stranger for 3 months, assuming Greg's plans even work out.  I wouldn't do it either, and at this point you're well rid of Greg.", "Most university housing will have policies against this and it\u2019s really inappropriate to ask your new roommate to share the space with someone not on the lease/housing agreement. NTA", "NTA. Aren't there rules with uni housing about who can & can't be in your place? Because he could very well have been breaking the rules. And endangering your housing too. Sounds like you dodged a bullet here.", "NTA! Sounds like Greg moving out in a week saved you potential drama down the road if his gf staying with yall turned out to be an issue.", "NTA. This is university housing. I don't think you usually CAN consent to that, even if it hadn't been a hot mess situation. There are a bunch of policies that aren't negotiable there. No matter what, NTA. That sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.", "NTA.\n\nGreg's domestic situation is not your problem. If he had intentions of moving in and marrying his gf, he should not have accepted university accommodations for a roommate.\n\nIt's weird enough moving in with a perfect stranger when you go to college. No way that I'd be comfortable moving in with a stranger then the stranger's gf/soon to be wife when I don't know either of them. You dodged a bullet here, OP.", "NTA - good on you for sticking up for yourself.  everyone wants to be liked, but this type of compromise has \"problem\" written all over it - it would no longer be your room.  when you get a new roommate, don't hesitate to set up clear boundaries, one of which should be very,  very clear boundaries on guests.", "NTA - I think you dodged a bullet, it's fine he moves out rather than youdeal with the ensuing drama. When you are asked it's ok to say no.", "This was an utterly unreasonable request and you were right to say no. If he's moving out who cares if he's upset with you? NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou handled this perfectly, and it sounds like the problem is solving itself with Greg moving out. Absolutely no good would have come to you if she had moved in, guaranteed.", "NTA", "It\u2019s easy to tell from the title that your NTA", "NTA. You dodged a bullet.", "NTA He searched a place just for himself knowing that he wants to move in with his gf?! Just no! He has a room for one person, he can't just move in another person. Especially since it is pretty much against the housing rules. Why didn't they searched a place for two?! And they are just so shortly together, so there will be lots of drama. Nope. \n\nLook in the lease how often he can have guest over. Not that she will be over 6 out of the 7 days of the week...", "NTA. Greg was basically asking you to house some random woman he didn't even know himself. You acted sensibly and responsibly.", "NTA", "NTA - I\u2019m also willing to bet that Greg wasn\u2019t planning on splitting the rent 3 ways, he would still expect you to pay half.", "This makes me think you dodged a bullet.  Good riddance.", "NTA\n\nJust because people get upset with you does not mean you (necessarily) did anything wrong. \n\nYou did good standing up for yourself.", "Nta.
