It is absolutely not your responsibility to coddle this jackass and I think you're a boss and an inspiration for hitting him with his own bullshit, but these sorts of delusional and entitled psychos can get violent when rejected so please just keep an eye out for any escalation on his part.", "NTA He called a woman his age old and used up? Sounds to me like he deserved to get it back. Good for you!", "NTA  You do not have to make the men in the world happy. You do not need to protect their fragile egos. You do not need to be afraid that someone will take a no, as something to get angry/upset about. Men need to be better.", "NTA\n\nDude couldn't take a hint. Seems like maybe he gets it now.\n\nRegardless, this is SUPER unprofessional behavior in the workplace, and his \"nickname\" for you is probably harassment. You've now made it perfectly clear that you're not interested... if he says anything even remotely suggestive in the future, I'd consider talking to a supervisor.", "NTA. Guess he didn't like getting a dose of his own medicine.", "Classic boys club bullshit.\n\nNTA. You can tell your co-workers they are gross for allowing  his degrading talk about women run for so long and that misogyny isn\u2019t cool anymore. He was making you uncomfortable. (honestly his behavior reeks of sexual harassment) and you have every right to stand up for yourself.\n\nMen who don\u2019t take no for an answer are an actually serious problem.", "NTA.

Ask the other guys what they would do if he was flirting with them. They will all agree fully pretty quick.", "NTA he got what he deserved. Well done", "NTA.  That guy is a creeper and is sexually harassing you.  You are not wrong and the other men you work with don't have to put up with his sexist b.s., do they?  If he continues to harass you, report him to your/his supervisor.", "NTA and make sure to be even more insulting next time.

If the guys are on your side, why didn\u2019t they say anything when Jim said it first?
