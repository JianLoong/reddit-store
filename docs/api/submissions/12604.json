The only way this would\u2019ve been even a *little* okay is if you suffered a personal loss.", "Of course everyone is furious at you - YTA.\n\nYou were merely 1 of 10,000 fans at the game your school lost, but your sister was 1 of 12 players on the court in her school's game. Your sister's level of commitment to the sport is in a whole different realm than yours - it's like comparing the big leagues to the sand lot.\n\nPerspective. Get some\n\neta: I just realized I made an assumption that OP was actually at the game his school lost. INFO: Was OP in the stands, or was OP watching on tv? Not that it matters for my YTA vote, it just changes the math to make OP 1 of 1,000,000 viewers.", "YTA. You basically told your sister that you care for your March Madness bracket more than her. After all, chances are that your school will get another shot at the tournament, what are the chances that your sister will get to play in a national tournament again? \n\nAnd, honestly, (speaking from someone living within an hour of two teams who regularly win national championships) if your team losing affects you that badly, you are taking this *way* to seriously and need to seek help.", "Info: Do you play on \"your team\" or is it just the team you were rooting for?", "YTA. You decided not to share in your sister\u2019s accomplishment with your family because you were upset a team you don\u2019t even play for lost? And you don\u2019t see how your priorities might be screwed up? I love sports. They\u2019re my passion and my career. I would never let them get in the way of my family. You\u2019ve gotta get your life in order.", "Info, how old are you?

So no, he's just a foul human being. Nothing gentle about it.\\*\\*\\*\n\nYeah, **YTA.**\n\nAnd honestly? It was wrong for them to call you immature. You weren't immature.\n\nYou were selfish.\n\nYou chose not to show up for your sister's own game because a team that you weren't even on lost a game. That kind of self-absorption is borderline pathological. The fact that you think that loss was in any way ABOUT you is horrifying. You need therapy. And lots of it.", "It could be worse, You could be a Purdue Fan!?!  Try to grow up a little!", "YTA. Everyone calling you immature is correct. Learn to handle disappointment. Life will continue to deliver it.", "YTA. You placed your position as a fan as more important than your position as a sibling. Also, nobody should be that depressed for days after a sports team they like lost. I would consider therapy", "Do you go to Purdue lol?\n\nIf you don't play for the team then obviously YTA. Im a fan of basketball and I get being upset that your team lost, but damn, you got some issues if you genuinely got depressed... you contributed nothing to the team other than cheers.

I mean, yeah, it's ok to be disappointed & upset. But it's ONLY a game. Nothing more, nothing less. Should never affect your life, even minutely.  Your sister though ....she.must've been so excited. What a damn stupid reason to miss her game.", "YTA. You don't even play on the team ffs. You are incredibly immature, why are you so invested in this other team when that's your sister and she is your team! It was a huge deal and you should have been there for her.", "YTA. Nice to your passion for your team- how about some passion for your sister?", "YTA. This was probably very important to her. You do things that are hard for you to support the people you love. That's called being family.", "YTA. First off, if you're too upset to support your sister because you lost a game you seriously need to grow up. That's something I would expect a 5 year old to do.", "Not only YTA, you\u2019re also 10-ply. If Jason Kelce go on SNL after losing to his brother in the Super Bowl, you can go to the game in which your sister is actually playing.

You don\u2019t even PLAY in the basketball game, but you\u2019re that upset by it. Yo get some therapy! That is literal insanity. You\u2019re not well, and yes 1,000% YTA for failing to support your sis.", "YTA. 15 seeds beat 2 seeds all the time. I\u2019m also a huge basketball fan but I can still function if my team loses. I can definitely still participate in important family events. Get yourself together.", "Was gonna lean to N/T/A until I learned that OP wasn't actually playing or part of the team that lost. \n\nLet's put aside the expense your family incurred to get you to this game - you have an unhealthy relationship with this sport and school. \n\nYTA", "Yes you are an asshole", "YTA - Kind of a selfish one too.", "Yta. My cousin and her parents are fanatics and my uncle was heavily involved in the sport. That's such a lame excuse not to support your sister.", "YTA. Arizona, eh? That was humiliating. And kind of boring since Princeton is super famous; would have been better if it was a nobody school like Fairleigh Dickinson so they could get ton of press attention. Least it\u2019s not the worst upset in the tournament. But hey, you\u2019re a fan \u2014 not a player of that loser squad \u2014 which makes your case much weaker.\n\nAnyway, YTA for getting on the plane and being in the hotel, and then refusing to go. You\u2019ve accepted the promise and used your father\u2019s money and can\u2019t follow through. If you couldn\u2019t walk, why not call an Uber or something? I mean come on man, that\u2019s just weak. This is like Ben Simmons passing the ball when he had a layup in the ECF G7 against Atlanta. Then show up to the breakfast? What did you think was going to happen.\n\nYou\u2019d still stink if you declined to go ahead of time \u2014 meaning you never got on a plane and went to hotel \u2014 for not supporting your sister despite loving basketball (I love basketball and never had any chance to root for someone I knew on a stage like this), although I might have called you a soft YTA instead, since at least then you didn\u2019t waste your father\u2019s money and accepted a conditional gift but failed to go through the conditions. Still would be a joker type of brother though.\n\nAlso, on the personal info side: You\u2019ve probably given too much away; I think someone could dox you dude if they really tried.

Really, how many times have we even made it to the Final Four??

Those players will get over that loss, and move one with their lives. In 40 years, that loss will be a blip in time for them. (Even if that isn\u2019t true, you will still mean nothing to them.

Sometimes you have to show up for others when you aren\u2019t at you\u2019re best. I once hosted my friend\u2019s engagement party the day after I found out my boyfriend of 3 years cheated on me.
