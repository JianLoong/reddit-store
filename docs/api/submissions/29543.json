I live in a studio, he lives in a shared flat. \nHe\u2019s having issues with a loud roommate, and isn\u2019t able to work comfortably from home. \n\nI offered to let him work from my place, as I don\u2019t work from home so my studio is empty during work hours. It worked out pretty well.\n\nThe problem: I had Friday off, so I was at home that day. While my boyfriend was working from my flat. \n\nThe slightest thing annoyed him. I think he likes to be alone when he\u2019s working but when you\u2019re two adults in a small studio you can\u2019t exactly pretend like the other doesn\u2019t exist.  If he had an interview or an important meeting I\u2019d understand and make myself scarce for an hour or two but he didn\u2019t. \n\nAnyways, things came to a head when I started cooking. I asked him what he wanted for lunch, he didn\u2019t want anything so I started preparing something for myself. My bed, kitchen area, desk (where he was working), and armchair are all in the same space. Only my bathroom is separate. This is pretty standard for a studio flat in my city. \n\nHe kept getting progressively more annoyed, and told me I should\u2019ve ordered delivery or gotten take out instead because the smell/sounds of me cooking made it difficult to concentrate. I told him I\u2019ve already started so I wasn\u2019t going to stop but I\u2019ll try to be quick. I got everything ready in under 20 minutes. \n\nBut he kept going on about how I wasn\u2019t considerate of him and how I made things \u201cdifficult\u201d for him. I told him I don\u2019t think I was being inconsiderate. I made lunch, I wasn\u2019t watching tv or listening to music. But he doesn\u2019t agree. \n\nWe have a public holiday at the end of the week, he\u2019ll be working but I\u2019ll be at home. He\u2019s already asking me to get delivery/take out and be super quiet, don\u2019t walk around too much and stuff while he\u2019s working. I got annoyed and asked him whether he\u2019d prefer if I go and stay with my dad that day since he\u2019s acting like this is his place and not mine. \n\nHe thinks I was out of line, and we\u2019ve been skirting around the conversation for a while. He expects me to bring it up/apologise because I\u2019m in the wrong.", "created_utc": 1698093372, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17euenj/aita_for_cooking_while_my_boyfriend_was_working/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like he is the problem, not the roommate, if this is the standard he has in his apartment too. He can deal or find another place to work. You aren't blasting music. You are just existing.

Is the roommate THAT loud. Or are they just existing in a shared space and pissing OP\u2019s boyfriend off?", "Yep! Does OP forget that the studio apartment is theirs and boyfriend DOESN'T live there??? \n\nI had something similar with a roommate. One bedroom apartment. She had a boyfriend who sometimes stayed over and they would sleep in the living room. I didn't mind this. But I was up at 6am for work. Went to make breakfast one morning and she got pissed that I woke them up. We had a discussion about it that evening and I told her that I pay rent, he does not. And considering I never know when he might stay over and I ALWAYS leave for work before her, it is unrealistic to expect me to never cook or do anything in the kitchen in the morning. However, if she wanted to give me money each time so I could buy my breakfast and lunch instead of making it, then okay. Yea... that never happened again.", "exactly", "LOL. I bet you his roommate isn't even really loud, just living normally.\n\nI also bet he tries to work in the living room or other shared space and gets pissed that his roommates exist. Instead of working from his own bedroom.", "That's a sucker bet - I totally agree with you. The way he's so entitled to her space and waiting for an apology and it doesn't even occur to him that he can/should go home is pretty revealing of his character.", "Funny, I didn't think of it until you said exactly this but someone in my household edits a video one day a week around lunch time. For whatever reason, they choose to stand at the kitchen island and then get pissy when people make noise or I have to have them move because I'm trying to make lunch. \n\nLike there's not a few other rooms they could do their thing in.", "I bet the roommate probably had the nerve to flush the toilet and maybe take a shower. The absolute horror!"]}
