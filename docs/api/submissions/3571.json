I would, however, hide a key somewhere so if, heaven forbid, something happened, your room could be accessed. Seriously - a key rock outside that you don't tell anyone about unless the house is literally on fire. \n\nI'd also do an inventory of your room because it's clear your family members don't respect your property or your boundaries. Don't argue with SIL. Tell her you expect the dress returned ASAP, dry cleaned, and ready for you to wear should you wish to. It also needs to be in the same condition it was before she stole it. Otherwise, you can bill her. \n\nGo get a locking doorknob.", "You weren't clear as to whether this was your favorite white dress.", "Or get home and clear out your closet."]}
