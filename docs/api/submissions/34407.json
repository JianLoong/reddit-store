I go to his house most weekends w my daughter and we stay most holidays at his place. I\u2019m basically only at my apartment on school nights. We intend to move in together once my daughter finishes this school year. \n\nFor my daughter\u2019s winter break we discussed that we would stay the full break, thru Jan 9th. Yesterday, Jan 4, my boyfriend was asked by his family (most of which were already in Cabo) if they paid for his ticket would he come on the trip. He immediately said yes. \n\nWhen I found out my feelings were extremely hurt. From my point of view he just completely went back on his commitment for me and my daughter to stay at his place thru her break. He told me to just stay at his house while he was gone & even implied that he would need help watching his dogs. I feel strongly that his assumption I would stay & watch his dogs is inconsiderate but I\u2019m also hurt that he basically ditched me and my daughter for a free trip to Cabo. \n\nHe\u2019s made several statements that he can\u2019t believe I\u2019m not happy for him. So AITA for not being happy that the trip is free even though his choice caused me & my daughter emotional pain?\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve been told in the comments that I should add I was given no prior warning to this trip. I arrived at his place after work to find him packing. I was given 2 options. Go home, or stay and watch his dogs. \n\nI think it\u2019s also important to know that we work together. He spoke with me on several occasions at work and never said a word about this trip.

Did HE know about the trip beforehand?", "YTA. And I highly doubt your daughter experienced \u201cemotional pain\u201d that her mother\u2019s boyfriend (lol) will be out of town for a few days. Don\u2019t use her as a pawn to get your way.", "INFO: did he talk with you about this at all?", "TLDR crew, I gotchu: YTA. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, for my fellow AITA enthusiasts, lets review the facts:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Agreement was to move in once your daughter \"*finishes this school year*\".  School years terminate before the Summer, NOT Winter break.\n\n\\-Winter break started on the 22nd of Dec (confirmed by OP in the comments). \n\n\\-He got the call for the trip on the 4th of Jan. This means he has already spent a considerable amount of the winter break with your daughter & yourself (2 weeks).\n\n\\-He would return from Mexico on the 8th of Jan. Assuming he left for Mexico on the 5th, He would be away from you for a total of 4 days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy advice:\n\nAsk yourself why are you feeling insecure about your bf wanting to spend time with his family? Going out on a limb, I would hypothesize its because the father of your daughter left you in a similar way. I'm sorry if that is the case. Its shitty of that dude. However, it looks life you've found a cool new guy who vibes not just with you, but ALSO your daughter. From your interactions after finding out he is going is indicative that you both have very different expectations when it comes to familial commitments. I would also assume that he does not have any prior kids and your daughter is his first experience in a somewhat parental role. If you believe that this man is a good fit for your daughter as a parental figure, I'd advise you to seek therapy and/or professional help. Being abandoned by a partner & left to raise a child alone is a deeply traumatic experience. Projecting your insecurity onto your new partner who might not have any context is the best way for your new man to react poorly. From your post, it can be inferred that you do in-fact think he reacted poorly. If you want to make this work it has to be you AND him versus the problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVerdict: YTA.\n\nGirl you've got a couple days with your daughter in a house you both will be moving into soon WITH doggos! Take advantage of the time you have with your daughter and make memories to share with your BF when he returns.", "He is not responsible for your daughter so stop bringing her feelings into it.

If my wife had the opportunity for a free trip like that I would be a little jealous but would otherwise being doing everything I could to make sure she could go, no problem. Everything isn't about you when you care about the other person.", "Yta. \n\nWow, left husband 8 months ago. Started a new relationship. Already planning on moving in with a new guy. Poor child. She is just going to be bounced around as you hunt for a man.\n\nHis family bought him a ticket for the last 4 days of a 3 week holiday. \n\nHope he knew you left so someone is taking care of the dog.", "Edit - YTA. You have spent two weeks of the three week break with him, I think it's petty to begrudge him a brief trip with his family.\n\nWhen did the break start?", "YTA. \n\nYou and your bf discussed to spend it together during *your* daughter's break. He spent time with you and your kid as agreed upon but you're getting pissy about him spending time with his family? You say that's inconsiderate for him to assume yet you did the same thing? Ok lol.", "YTA. I know it sounds harsh, but you're coming off as emotionally dependent. Sure, I'd also be upset if my SO left while we were supposed to spend time together, but it doesn't sound like you had any plans - you were just going to hang out and see what the day brought. His parents were generous in offering a free trip, would you have not taken it if offered?\n\nEditing for - you've spent two weeks together already. It's not like he just up and ditched you right away. Spend some quality time with your kid.", "YTA\n\nYou seem dependent on him. Your daughter probably doesn't even care that he left. Let him enjoy his free trip and you need to find things or friends so that you aren't so attached to him all time.", "YTA - why on earth would you expect him to pass on a free trip?", "Seriously? Yta, you're that emotionally dependent on your bf you begrudge him a trip that will only last a couple of weeks? Either suck it up and be happy for him or let him go, on the trip and out of the relationship...", "YTA, it\u2019s only a few days and you\u2019ve had two weeks with him. Why can\u2019t he spend time with his family. Most of his family was already there, they probably missed him and wished he was there with everyone else.", "YTA\n\nLet him have a trip.  Stay where you want to stay.  Why are you upset about this?  Exactly what is the cause of this emotional pain?", "YTA\n\nYou honestly think that he should've turned down a spontaneous free vacation, paid for by his family, because you guys made to plans to \"hang out\"? Needy much?", "I would feel really selfish if I denied my partner the opportunity to enjoy a free trip with his family in an exotic place. You already got to spend most of the holiday with him. It is not as if you had major plans to do something special. You were just going to \"hang out\". He spent Christmas and the New Year with you.\n\nYou should be nice and watch his dogs for him. \n\nIf I were your BF, your attitude here could be a dealbreaker.", "YTA - her break ends on the 9th and he was told on the 4th. You and her did spend 99% of her winter break with him. He\u2019s also allowing you to continue to stay at his place which is what you\u2019re worried about. It would be different if some random woman coworker asked him to take her to Cabo and he said yes but that\u2019s not the case. It\u2019s his family. He\u2019s still allowed to have experiences with his family as well as you are. It\u2019s a free trip so it doesn\u2019t mess with your finances and it\u2019s only for a bit. I think you might be feeling rejected which is throwing you into the emotional reaction response to this. There is no offense here. You wanted him to spend her winter break with you guys and he did. You want to continue to stay at his house and you can. It\u2019s only going to be for a small bit of time.", "As someone who\u2019s been in a very cumulative position, I\u2019m gonna have to say YTA sorry. My partner and had been together for less than year as well and had plans to go see a light festival together when he won a free trip to the last capital city he hasn\u2019t been to in Australia. Whilst he at least asked me how I felt about everything, I told him to go. \n\nIt\u2019s probably a once in a life time trip, especially for free, and you had already spent the previous 2 weeks together including Christmas and New Years. The big events you had planned together have already happened. He left 4 days earlier than discussed, and as someone who is family oriented, it would have only further increased my want for him to go if they would be with him as well. \n\nI feel like in a healthy relationship, especially a budding one, flexibility is a key trait to have. Everyone has different expectations in a relationship, and if this is a deal breaker for you, then you should leave. But before making this decision, please ask yourself, \u2018if your daughter won a trip to Disneyland 4 days before you were supposed to leave, would you take her?\u2019", "Why is your daughter upset? That\u2019s most concerning to me. After spending two weeks with him, your boyfriend is going to be gone for a few days. I would be doing everything I can do make sure she is not emotional dependent on him, he is your boyfriend, there\u2019s a solid chance things don\u2019t work out, and if this upsets her then your break up will be traumatizing. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s just you completely dependent on him and you wanted to manipulate Reddit by saying your daughter is upset.", "YTA, I\u2019d be happy for my partner to get a free trip to Cabo in the dead of winter, and he\u2019d be happy for me too! Never in a million years would I ask him to turn it down. He\u2019s not moving there, it\u2019s a visit.", "You\u2019re not TA but neither is he. You\u2019re allowed to be disappointed your plans didn\u2019t go as expected, he\u2019s allowed to take his family up on the offer of a free trip to Cabo", "I would question moving in with him. \n\nHe seems to have little regard for your feelings. No prior discussion even? Wow.\n\nNTA", "YTA.\n\nHe got a free trip to Cabo. Why in the world wouldn't you be happy for him?\n\nDoes his happiness matter nothing to you?", "You have commitment and emotional issues based off your first post", "Emotional pain? It's not like he ditched you for the whole vacation,  just a few days.  Rather than be happy for him ( being a little jealous would be okay) you sound like a needy child.  You are under no obligation to watch his dogs  and if that is what you were mad about  I'd get that, but just for him taking the trip ...nah.   YTA OP", "Idk, on the fence with this one. How long have you been together? \n\nA bit puzzled by the whole scenario; you (and your daughter?) are emotionally devastated and he doesn\u2019t sound emotionally invested at all.", "ESH, but leaning a little to the side of YTA. He was asked last minute and had to make a last minute decision. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s been planning on going and has been hiding it or lying about it to you. I too would have said yes in a millisecond (of course) and hoped that my partner would  understand or at minimum, not turn it into a big deal where a fight ensues. \n\nHowever, I think perhaps he could have approached it a little more sensitively. Instead of you walking in on him packing, he could have let you know right when he made the choice. He\u2019s not wrong for his decision, but maybe the delivery could have been better. \n\nHaving said that, I think it\u2019s pretty lame and a little selfish to be mad at him for taking this amazing opportunity instead of just staying home for the week. If you guys are moving in together, then there will be many more weeks to come where you  can spend all the time in the world at home. And who knows, by that point you\u2019ll be begging for him to leave for a last minute vacay lol. \n\nLet the man go have some fun with his family. I get it sucks for you and maybe you\u2019re even feeling some jealously, but now you have the week with your daughter and can do anything. Do something out of the box with her and change it up a little. Hey, maybe take her to Cabo?", "I agree with the others here OP, YTA. If you got to see your boyfriend like twice a year due to long distance your reaction would be much more understandable. \n\nYeah it sucks that your time with him got cut off early, but\u2026 you did just spend like 2 weeks with him straight. And you\u2019re going to be able to spend time with him again as soon as he comes back home. He isn\u2019t going to Vietnam for 2 years, he\u2019s going for probably a week at most. It\u2019s free, and his family is there. There is very little betrayal actually happening here.\n\nI mean, would you prefer he stay to placate your emotions because you can\u2019t take him leaving 4 days early? I guarantee you he\u2019d silently resent you for a long time for that. Your mindset isn\u2019t just clingy, it\u2019s selfish.", "Question: who did he plan to take care of the dogs if you go home?\nThat it's the part I have most problems with. I wouldn't like for my bf to ditch me last notice but I could understand, specially if it's only 4 days out of 2 to 3 weeks. But counting me to take care of the dogs without previous notice it's a no for me", "ESH. I don't know why no one is seeing this, but he committed to hosting you for the whole break and then did not inform or consult you before making a unilateral decision to leave. For that reason, he sucks. Not for making the decision he did, but for the lack of consideration for you in the circumstance.\n\nYou suck because you are reading more into this commitment than I think it's reasonable to. When neither of you has plans it's fine to stay with him. When plans come up, it's fine to go back home. You seem to think this was a commitment, when it sounds like a relational convenience. I think you are being a bit unfair with how you are viewing the situation. You are also being unreasonable with arguments in the comments like \"he must honor his commitment\" and \"what am I going to tell my daughter?\" \n\nIn the end, I think he needs to prioritize communication, and you might want to check why you're really upset. It sounds like copedendence, but this might also come from a place of narcissism, where you overvalue your time/convenience and undervalue his.", "YTA and a major one at that.

Sorry, Aussie here. \n\nIf this is impacting the last 3 days of 2 weeks- I think you should probably get over it.....seems like incompatibility may be getting highlighted here, though. I would absolutely take a free trip, but I wouldn't talk to my partner unless they were there for the call...mostly because I know he supports my freedom, and if you delay, ticket prices may rise. \n\nIf your boyfriend is someone who wants to go on spontaneous adventures, he can't be the \"step dad\" you seem to want. \n\nYour daughter is not his responsibility, though, to be blunt. Especially without knowing how long you've been together, it's hard to even guess his level of commitment and responsibility.", "NTA if he had bothered to communicate with you, explained his plans that would be different, he is at work with you all day so no excuses, you turned up with your daughter to stay with him, which WAS planned, he said either go home or stay here and watch my dogs, on what planet s he not a complete AH!", "NTA. I seem to be in the minority here but you\u2019re allowed to have feelings about him just up and leaving.

You deserve better than finding out about this by walking in on him packing. At the very least you deserved a courtesy call. \n\nIf he was packing, he knew he was going. He could have called. There is nothing clingy about being upset about how he went about this. \n\nThis is not a situation where you had a conversation and you begrudge him going. This is a situation where you weren\u2019t even shown basic respect and expected to pick up his slack. \n\nWhat happens if you say no to looking after the dogs?!

He spent 2 weeks with your daughter and you and was offered a free trip and he took it, he deserves his own time too and I know for a fact you would take a free trip too if given the chance.

You're doing yourself and your child a disservice and causing the emotional pain yourself by being this needy and clingy.

I'll probably get downvoted into oblivion for it but someone needs to play devil's advocate and say the the flip side of this. I can't believe how many people think this behavior is ok. This is NOT a clingy or attachment issue as others have claimed. It's a \"him canceling plans last minute because better plans arose\" issue. The 2 of you together planned what days you'd be there, and it sounds like you had some activities for the week planned too based on your other comments. It's irrelevant that you already spent a bunch of time with him in the weeks leading up to this. What's relevant is that you had a plan of when you'd come over - and he essentially canceled those plans. I see this scenario no different than if, for example, Cindy has plans to go get dinner at Olive Garden with Mary on Friday. However, on Thursday Cindy receives a call from her boyfriend Bobby asking if she wants to go to an NHL hockey game Friday, since he got free tickets. Cindy agrees to go to the hockey game Friday instead because she's always wanted to go to an NHL game. Cindy calls Mary and tells Mary she won't be able to make it to Olive Garden on Friday because she received a free ticket to the hockey game. Cindy tells Mary: don't worry Mary, you can still go to Olive Garden alone since it'll be open. So yeah. This situation is not about being clingy. It's the rudeness of canceling plans because a better opportunity arose. I can't believe how many of you think this is acceptable behavior. She's not mad that he gets to see his family. She's mad he ditched their plans because something better came up. It's selfish behavior to go back on prior plans because something better came up. Smh.", "YTA. You\u2019ve already had like 2 weeks already. Give the guy the 4 days. Calm it down.", "YTA. Wait wait wait. Your ex cheated on you several times. You finally kicked him to the curb less than 8 months ago. You already introduced your daughter to a new guy (whom you are 'freshly dating'). You spent holidays with his family!

Also, TA.", "NTA - The simple fact that you guys work together and he couldn't be bothered to say anything was extremely disrespectful. \n\nHe purposely didn't tell you because he knew you'd be upset and he wanted to put you in a position to watch his dogs once you were already there. This is extremely selfish.\n\nThe people saying you are the ahole are clueless about communication in a relationship. Communication is the bedrock of any healthy relationship and a free trip does not trump that requirement. \n\nWhat he did was try to manipulate you to his own advantage. Had he given you a proper heads up and not blindsided you with this I would hope you would have been more understanding. \n\nIt also sounds like there was no remorse or compassion in his delivery of the news. It was basically this is what's happening so suck it up. Kick rocks or pick up dog crap but I'm going. Oh and why aren't you happy about this. Sigh\n\nYou are right to be upset because he did commit to spending time with you. Free trip or not this sets the tone for your future. \n\nI would hold off on moving in together as small things like this turn into big things. \n\nHe is showing a clear disregard for your feelings and your time as well as your daughters. You may get a lot of flack and I'm sure I'll be downvoted into oblivion but if this is a pattern of his behavior you may need a break or a break up. \n\nTake some time to really think.

I\u2019d find it weird if I had plans to go visit a friend and they just decided to up and leave; that\u2019s like the defn of getting ditched.

Not only was it a free vacation, it was a few days of uninterrupted time with his family. You can\u2019t put a price on that. He should have communicated better. However, because you\u2019re a mom, I\u2019m sure there have been or will be times when you have to change plans at the last minute because your daughter needs you.

When two S/O\u2019s live together much like you both will shortly, and one has a trip out of town, do they hire a dog sitter? No, the one in town usually watches the dogs.

If you and your daughter were offered a free trip to a beautiful location at the last minute, can you honestly say you wouldn't reschedule any local plans you had and go? Of course you would go. \ud83d\ude44\n\nAs for watching his dogs, you're under no obligation to do that, of course. But since you were planning on staying at his place anyway, it would seem like sour grapes to say no and go back home. And as for your daughter being \"disappointed\", well she's going to take her emotional cues from you. If you shift your perspective here and use this as an opportunity to have some quality mommy-daughter time, she won't be disappointed at all. And I bet you'd enjoy that too. Take her someplace special for lunch or dinner and out for some activities that you enjoy together. \n\nStop sulking and setting a bad example. Have a conversation with your boyfriend when he gets home about maybe his family could give him a bit more notice next time, but then let it go.", "I\u2019m going with YTA.\n\nYou spent the entire holiday together and it seems he didn\u2019t see his family. He will only be gone half a week in the next three weeks. You both getting alone time is important and you are being a bit too controlling, in my opinion.\n\nHis family wants to see him and I think you are being unfair.", "YTA and sound clingy af. I can\u2019t see what he has done wrong. He hasn\u2019t committed anything you live in town and see him always. You\u2019re booting off for attention or because you feel slighted. I\u2019d get over it quickly tbh, because none of it sounds like attractive traits anyone wants in a partner.", "YTA \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re more upset you couldn\u2019t use his house for you and your daughter and it\u2019s coming off extremely needy and overbearing", "YAH.  Would you give up tickets for yourself & daughter to Cabo?  Probably not. \nIt\u2019s a family trip for him. His family cannot be expected to pay for his gf ticket with a kid in tow. \nYou come across jealous and petty.", "Yes. (I can\u2019t seem to bring myself to write YTA here.) but you definitely need to change your viewpoint on this. It seems very selfish of you to begrudge him a free trip to go see his family. Even if your feelings are hurt, dig deep, and find the goodwill to offer him wishes for a fun trip. And send your love to his family. Maybe you will be invited next time if you don\u2019t act like the Ahole about it", "This comment section is stupid \n\nESH you\u2019re overreacting and should probably find a way to manage your feelings on this better but literally everyone is overlooking his massive lack of communication with you and his lack of plan to care for his dogs. Changing the agreed upon plan without so much as a conversation with you before packing his bags is incredibly inconsiderate to you and your daughter even if he\u2019s not wrong for ultimately going on the trip", "How are is dogs doing? Lol I bet they miss him. \n\nAnyway, imo YTA lol. I get it, I do. But it\u2019s not like he did anything reallyyyy bad. As long as he tried to recover from it like taking you on a weekend trip.\n\nHis family wants him there. His support system. The dream is that it\u2019s all about you. But until you move in together and are a unit, idk if you should be expecting that. \n\nThat money he saved should be money put in a savings account to move in together. Or a partial or w.e but yeah. \n\nI would be disappointed to be ditched and all but if it\u2019s for family I kind of have to accept it. I might not be happy about it, but I won\u2019t look down on em for it. I\u2019ll express and move past. If it was friends, coworkers etc that would be different. \n\nI\u2019m petty. I would have charged to watch the dogs but only for principal. Because if you needed me to, you are restricting me of making plans. I\u2019m upper middle class(I think) with a good credit line with no debt. I can take me and my daughter to Miami or a trip to a water park and ski resort, etc. \n\nBut if you plan on being with them long term, you gotta deal with this dumb shit until y\u2019all really start your life together. \n\nIt happens, it sucks, I know. \nYou get what you get and you don\u2019t get upset. \n\n(Too short notice now but next time try have them paying for you too and have the daughter watch the dogs hahahahahha) \n\nDon\u2019t forget to text your bf and wish him fun in a nice polite way. We love that \ud83e\udee0", "He is doing a trip with his family and that should not be a big deal.  I can understand you are disappointed but I wouldn't make a mountain out of a mole hill.  That is just my point of view.", "Tagging on this to ask another question : When did he say he was coming back?", "No. The trip was sprung on me in a 4 hour time frame.", "No. I got home from work to him packing his suitcase.", "I\u2019m mostly concerned about the boyfriend leaving the dogs at home alone, without communicating beforehand with anyone, for over a whole weekend?", "But if she doesn\u2019t bring up her daughter she can\u2019t attempt to weaponize her to garner sympathy because she is a huge asshole who thinks it\u2019s ok", "It\u2019s not that he\u2019s spending time with his family that bothers me. It\u2019s the lack of consideration. \n\nFrom my PoV it seems like any time in the future that he has plans with me, but something more exciting comes up, he\u2019s likely to ditch me. Which is what happened", "All of this. It's not like he ditched them the first day of the kids holiday break.", "I assumed the annoyance was due to 1. **Not  saying** *anything* **the entire day**\n\nBless all these understanding ppl, **but I'd be pissed if I packed myself and my child up, after work, in traffic across the whole damn town get anywhere, with no plans but just sitting on the bloody couch and watch paint dry...to now being told** *surprise! Bye!*\n\nReally?!\nHe couldn't say anything **all** damn day?", "So if you guys have holiday plans and you partner says \u201canyway I\u2019m off to do my own thing\u201d you\u2019d be chill about that?\n\nBecause these were holiday plans they had to spend time together and he just left:\n\nComments are wild \ud83e\udee0\n\nEDIT: you can stop messaging me about the free trip, it is irrelevant. Where\u2019s the communication? He just said I\u2019m off without discussing it. That\u2019s wild. And not how couples should behave.

Like you say, it all sounds like it was intended to be fairly low key, at his house and hanging with OP's daughter. It is also apparently a \"fresh\" relationship, which I take to mean at least <6 months time.\n\nAnd she is getting upset that he is going to go and spend **four days** with his family in Mexico... A move which also does not massively put her out (as she can just go back to her own home).\n\nThe only asshole-ish move on the guy's part is the assumption that she would stick around and look after his dogs.\n\nLikewise, I get where she's coming from about commitment to plans, but she needs to show some flexibility here and not get so apparently upset over him taking the trip. I am actually also honestly a bit put-off by the fact that she mentions how important this commitment was to her daughter a few times. Y'know, the commitment between the DEFINITELY new boyfriend and her daughter? It feels like she's trying to use her daughter to guilt the guy.\n\nDefinitive YTA.", "OP sounds exhausting.  I hope BF sees the red flags from OP's behavior and breaks up.\n\nBF already spent 2 weeks, including Christmas and New Years, and OP can't be happy for the guy who is spending 4 days with his family?", "So he\u2019s not an AH for not communicating with her to change plans that include her or for having no real plan to care for his pets? Dumping that responsibility on OP while halfway out the door essentially and hoping she does it? He\u2019s not wrong for going but he\u2019s sure wrong for making a unilateral decision that impacts their agreed upon plan together without so much as a 5 minute convo and without having secured pet care", "This one seems like a solid ESH.  \n\nA free trip to Mexico with family really sounds like an experience the OP should be encouraging her boyfriend to take advantage of.\n\nThat said, when you are partners and especially partners who are, at least to some degree, living together, it's reasonable to expect a bit more communication about changes in plans than walking in on your partner packing. Even a heads up he's planning on asking his parents about joining them would have been better, especially if he wants to leave her with the responsibility of the pets.", "Doesnt OP have family she can spend time with? Why does she have to drag her daughter every week to her boyfriend's place?", "We did have plans for the weekend. I can understand a free trip & all that, but it just feels like to me he went back on his commitment to me and my daughter. \n\nI can honestly say if I had someone staying with me I wouldn\u2019t take an offer for a free trip because I think it\u2019s rude to ditch someone when you asked them to come stay with you.", "The daughter probably wants to hang out with the dogs", "Because he had already committed to me that we would be spending the allotted holiday break time.", "I\u2019m guessing the emotional pain is because OP and her child were not also provided a free trip. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Him going back on his commitment to spend the holiday break time with us. I think I wouldn\u2019t have been as hurt had this been planned out ahead of time but I literally came home from work to him packing.", "It wasn\u2019t plans to \u201chang out\u201d. It was a time frame that was previously agreed upon.

Have fun and bring me back a present\" \ud83d\ude04", "I would feel selfish too, but I\u2019d also feel annoyed if it wasn\u2019t even discussed with me.

NAH.", "We did have plans to do many things for my daughters last weekend of her break. Should his decision making not be a major deal breaker for me?", "And see I was going to go the opposite and say ESH instead of N-A-H. \nHe needed to tell her, not just have her show up while he was packing, and make plans for his dogs even if that meant asking her to. A quick message after the change in plans would be enough to let her know. She\u2019s also being dramatic about it from what it reads - he\u2019s leaving for four days of over two weeks and they had no explicitly important plans in the days he\u2019s missing.\nI can totally see the angle you\u2019re taking too though.\n\nOP, sounds like you guys could use a little more communication practice before you finalize your plans to move in together. Use this as a stepping stone to identify your differences in expectations within the relationship too and discuss them. Sure these conversations can be a challenge but these types of situations happen and understanding what each person expects ahead of time is what keeps them from all turning out just like this one where you both are upset.", "Except she\u2019s not just a little disappointed, she\u2019s furious he\u2019s going and doesn\u2019t think he should. That makes her TAH.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about his happiness, but more so the lack of being updated about the situation and changes. Not disagreeing with OP being TA, but she doesn\u2019t hold all the blame. But with that being said, I think OP and her daughter aren\u2019t\u2026 as important to the bf\u2019s family as they are to the actual boyfriend. It almost seems like his family didn\u2019t want her and the kid there. And that\u2019s fair, but having family members constantly calling and telling you to drop everything that you\u2019re doing and come to Mexico, just you, not the girls? Doesn\u2019t seem like op and her daughter have blended well with family so far. And maybe that\u2019s part of her reaction to everything, but the bf definitely should have been more open/expressive about the plans and how the cousins calling actually made him feel. \n\nIt\u2019s obvious OP has expressed how she\u2019s feeling about everything, but the BF\u2019s expressions are showing (from what I\u2019ve read through so far at least) that he didn\u2019t intend to make OP aware of however he was feeling/thinking. No one is innocent here except the dogs and daughter.", "OP said that winter break started on December 22 so they had him for 17 days instead of 21 days.. oh the drama \ud83d\ude44. Also they admitted that this was a new or fresh relationship. The only issue here is OP moving her daughter in with a man she just started dating and her clingy unreasonable attitude.", "I\u2019m torn. It\u2019s supposedly a newish relationship, which one could argue means she shouldn\u2019t really dictate or be involved in any of his decisions to spend time with his family or whatnot, but at the same time if a relationship is new and you\u2019ve got plans to have your girlfriend come stay over, would you really start packing for another trip and not tell them until they *arrive at your house to stay over.* like that detail being missed by so many people is just wild to me. Swing it the other way, if his family arrived to stay with him for the weekend and he was packing to fly away with his girlfriend without telling them first, would he be deemed TA? Probably. Just a sliver of communication from him could\u2019ve protected him from being TA.\n\nThe reason I\u2019m torn is with all this being said, I do think OP sounds a little unhinged based on her reaction, projection on her child and as I said, it\u2019s a new relationship. This is a lot of reliance on someone so new, she should guard her heart a bit more and ease into it. They clearly haven\u2019t been dating long enough to know if moving in together is actually the right decision.", "These comments are making me feel insane. He showed absolutely no regard for OP by not saying a word about it, and then assuming she would be his built in pet sitter. It's not about being happy for him or not, it's about the lack of respect.", "Exactly! I thought I was crazy. He didn\u2019t even discuss it with her. She just got to his house to find him packing and expecting her to watch his dogs. That would make me feel really insignificant and disposable. It\u2019s not that he wants to spend time with his family, it\u2019s that he decided to break their plans without even telling her.", "Lmao come the fuck on. Do people here truly think that pet owners don't make plans, and then when a closer and better option shows up, they pivot to that instead? Do you HONESTLY think he was gonna leave the dogs alone for 4 days. Really.", "Did you read her comments where she said he turned down the offer to go numerous times? Him and her both knew. He probably kept saying no because he has to walk on eggshells with his clingy ass gf.", "How many people leave and just don't have anyone to sit their dogs? If OP doesn't want to do it, I'm sure he has a backup dog sitter.", "Not long, in the comments she said it\u2019s a newish relationship. OP is a sucks trying to place responsibility for her kids feelings while moving at warp speed with a man whilst not thinking of her kids feelings at all.", "I also voted NTA and am prepared to watch my karma go negative lol. I agree with all of your points!", "Yes!! You nailed it. NTA.", "I appreciate the devil\u2019s advocate take! But I disagree because your example takes this situation completely out of context. This isn\u2019t a dinner out to Olive Garden versus free tix to a hockey game. This is a last minute already paid for trip to Cabo (paid for by his family might I add, not a random free ticket to a game that costs a fraction of what we are talking about here) versus spending time at his own home with his S/O. Your example and this situation are completely incomparable. \n\nSay they had a vacation planned together, and he last minute canceled that to go to Cabo without her instead, I think your example would fit well.\n\n\u201cTaking the 21 versus 17 days at his house\u201d portion out of this situation (although I think that it IS relevant but I\u2019ll take it out because why not), she not one time mentions the loss of quality time spend with him in her post. It\u2019s all related to \u201cHe agreed for me to stay at his house\u201d not one comment in the post inclines being bummed because the loss of quality time together. It almost reads less of a \u201cplan\u201d, inclining \u201changout\u201d versus what I\u2019d more argue, an arrangement. Which, technically isn\u2019t even broken given she has the offer to stay at his house while he\u2019s gone. \n\nEven there is a direct implication of being bummed because of the loss of quality time, I think anyone of adult-age can agree that plans change, and to describe this situation as \u201cemotionally damaging\u201d for not only her but her daughter, is an exaggeration here.", "Disagree with this as he spent 2 of the 3 weeks with her and she's clearly extremely controlling.", "Maybe he has to sneak around for fun.  She seems to make him defacto family man and suck the remaining joy out of his life.", "Actually I can\u2019t imagine committing my time to someone & then cutting that time short the second a better opportunity presented itself.

I see this scenario no different than if, for example, Cindy has plans to go get dinner at Olive Garden with Mary on Friday. However, on Thursday Cindy receives a call from her boyfriend Bobby asking if she wants to go to an NHL hockey game on Friday since he got free tickets. Cindy agrees to go to the hockey game Friday instead because she's ways wanted to go to an NHL game. Cindy calls Mary and tells Mary she won't be able to make it to Olive Garden on Friday because she received a free ticket to the hockey game. Cindy tells her: don't worry Mary, you can still go to Olive Garden alone since it'll be open. So yeah. It's not about being clingy. It's the rudeness of canceling plans because a better opportunity arose. I can't believe how many of you think this is acceptable behavior. She's not mad he gets to see his family.

I think it's fair if Cindy wants to go to a Stanley Cups playoff game (or perhaps an even rarer game than that, most families don't have big international trips all together all that often) that she got a free ticket to at the last minute. Mary would be a shitty friend to be mad at Cindy and think that she's selfish in this scenario. The scale of your example and the scale of the actual scenario OP is discussing are not the same.\n\nThat being said, I think it's fair to expect better communication if he'd known about this ticket that was purchased for him for a while (I haven't seen OP indicate when he was told about it, but if it was more than a couple hours then he could have had better communication). However, I also think it's fair if he was nervous to tell her, anticipating that she would react poorly and in a manner disproportionate to the situation (which, as indicated by the posts and comments, she did).", "Yea if my gf called n said her bf got free tix to something cool when we had mundane plans, I'd say 'you can tell me all about it when we go to olive garden next'. That's different than manipulating plans to be self serving, that's just life throwing out the unexpected and being happy when someone lucks into something cool, even if I am a little sad bc I was looking forward to Olive Garden.\n\nThat said, I think she is valid to her feelings, but that she is waaaay off in who is responsible for what here.
