That $200 is your money, not theirs to split", "You just got your money back, that's it,  It was your money to begin with.  nta  If they think they are being hustled... they can get their own bnb and pay full price between one or 2 of them.", "NTA, it wasn't a discount.

And this isn't even comparable due it being your money!", "NTA but if it happens again, next time just apply the credit to a different booking that is all yours. You didn\u2019t HAVE to apply the credit to this specific booking, and now you are forewarned that you have friends who don\u2019t grok the concept of store credit. Ultimately, you\u2019re spending the same amount of money either way, but this way you will avoid the headache in the future.", "NTA AT ALL! That $200 wasnt free and i mean its $60 vs $40 like thats not a big difference or something worth hustling someone for i think.... hope they understand", "The $200 credit is your own money which you used to pay for a $600 room.  \n\nBut the freaking title of this post talks about a \u201cdiscounted price\u201d.

You have a right to be mad at them. I guess the silver lining is that you know to explain situations asap.", "NTA. You had to spend the entire amount to receive the credit anyway, the friends that are mad need basic math. 400+200= 600 no matter how the amounts are applied.", "NTA.

The $200 credit is linked to your inability to get a refund on the prior booking - so it\u2019s making up for your prior losses; that was not a discount at all.

This is basically money that was given to you, not a regular coupon", "YTA only for not telling them why you got a credit.

Life is too short to argue this with them.", "NTA- They don't seem to understand that they are paying you back for covering their portion which is why they are paying $60 instead of $40. If they want a free vacation they should just say it.", "NTA because the $200 was basically your money. $60 is not alot for an AirBNB either and they clearly had no issue paying it before. It would have been that much without the $200 credit so they need to get over it.", "Do they value that 200 credit as less value than 200 cash? if you booked It and paid in full with all your money first and then got the money back from them it's fine. It's not like it was a discount really either it was a refund from a previous cancelled trip that you applied to the current plan and would've been used.
