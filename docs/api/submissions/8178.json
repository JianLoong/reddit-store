I love you and your girlfriend seems lovely.\" At this point, continuing to justify what you did and said is continuing to risk sticking your foot in your mouth, whereas simply offering a straightforward apology for the mistake and an acknowledgment of what your son was trying to share with you is probably the best way to make sure he KEEPS sharing things with you.

No. As a bi dude myself I get how it can suck to have people disregard your relationships as you being \u2018wishy-washy\u2019 or how \u2018you just can\u2019t make up your mind\u2019, but that\u2019s not what was happening here.", "Yeah like, all of this could have been avoided if the son had just given them a heads up that he was bringing someone over and it was a girl. I'm all for fighting bi-erasure, but I don't think OP was wrong for assuming his son was gay if he's only every talked about boy crushes and only ever dated boys. OP's son is young so it probably explains a lot of this, but he really should have seen this coming. A quick phone call of \"so-and-so and I aren't dating anymore and also I'm dating a new person her name is such-and-such and I'd like to bring her over for dinner\" and gotten all of this out of the way ahead of time.", "That's kinda my point though. If your parents suck, are nosy and controlling etc, why even bring a partner home? This wasn't a circumstance that just came up. OPs son deliberately decided to bring his girlfriend home and didn't give them any pre-warning that ANYONE was coming over, let alone that he'd broken up with his ex-bf that he was in a serious relationship with and was dating this new person. \n\nI hear you on nosy parents, I didn't keep mine updated on my dating life and only introduced 2 people to them. But then if we assume that OP sucks and is a shit father, it begs the question, why is the son introducing his new gf to his family and expecting them to just KNOW what's going on?", "Theres a very obvious reason why you're getting downvoted so much and I think you need to figure out why before continuing in the comments", "I mean considering OP literally didn't know who his son was dating at the time we can pretty clearly guess they don't have that level of communication but also in my case yeah!\n\nWhen I brought home my wife for the first time all I told my parents was \"I have a date coming by tonight, so I'll make us all dinner, but I may not be around much after that.\" And then that was that! I was an adult, in college, with a job, and only living at home because the school year was out of session, so as far as any of us were concerned there wasn't anything much else to talk about.\n\nOnce my wife and I got more serious, we all definitely had more in depth conversations! But that was well over a year later and still very much more me telling my parents things, less them asking me questions. At the time, it just didn't seem like the time or the place. I was old enough that I didn't need my parents protectively interviewing me or my partner about our relationship, and while I was there to see my parents, my partner was there *with me* not *to be introduced to them* which is a minor but important distinction that seems to be present here in this story too. Many older teens (18/19) will sort of let their life casually unfold in their parents' presence rather than officially informing them of it until such time as they decide there is something to officially inform of. It's a stylistic choice I think more than anything, and tends to happen most in families that raise sort of \"live and let live\" kids, whether on purpose or on accident.\n\nMy parents very much did that on purpose! Not everyone who develops that approach did so because their parents meant for them to. I genuinely don't know if OP intended to be so hands off in his approach to knowing what goes on in his son's love life. But queer kid's especially tend more towards that hands off-ness due to early fears and anxieties about acceptance (yes, even if our parents end up being accepting, we often still fear it, hell, my mother was literally married to another woman and I was still hesitant about coming out to them because they were never quiet about \"assuming\" my straightness and it can be scary to go against that). So it may not have been entirely OPs choice. But it also may have been! If OP and his son have struggled with their conversations about his son's love life in the past, this lack of communication now is likely a bit inevitable (though it doesn't have to stay that way! The more OP is open to communicating, asking non-shaming questions, and being genuinely engaged, the more likely that distance shrinks).\n\nAnyway, I realize that's a lot of words to answer your question, but it's a pretty complex situation I think!", "But neither did Tanner ever say to OP \"Dad I'm gay\". Dad made that assumption all on his own. And as I'm sure we've all heard, when we assume, we make an ass out of u and me.", "In my case, because I'm not close with my family I didn't bring home just whoever I was dating. Only if we had been together for a while and intended for it to last. In total I've dated about 8ish people (depending on your definition of dating), I've only brought 2 home. My parents have incidentally met other people I've dated when they visited me in college once or twice but I didn't let them know we were dating because it wasn't serious and so it didn't concern them. \n\nMaybe I view things more black and white, but if OPs son isn't close enough to his parents to tell them who he's dating, then why is he bringing them home? In my experience, you only bring them home to foster a relationship with your family because you think this person is going to be around for a while. It doesn't sound like this relationship has been going on for very long... But maybe the son doesn't think of it like that and was just thinking of the free meal they could both have, who knows. But ultimately I think OP is NTA and the son really could have done some work to avoid that awkwardness. If he's going to be bringing a new person home he should give his parents a heads up.", "The son didn't even tell his father that he and his boyfriend had broken up \u2013 OP assumed they were still in a relationship. With that info, I never would have skipped to the conclusion that Tanner and Natasha could be a couple.", "He did though. OP literally said so. That's the thing. He was given repeated indications that he just breezed right by because he *wasn't paying attention*", "> You can't expect OP to know Tanner is bi if Tanner never says he is.\n\nHe never said he was gay, but for some reason you think OP should assume that means gay instead of bi?", "It's a problem because of bi-erasure. That he could be bi is a reasonable conclusion because OP literally had to ignore him introducing a gf to keep the misconception. OP is the one who implied his son wouldn't use the term gf casually as well. \n\nBy that same logic, there is no reason to assume Tanner is gay if he never says he is. There's equal possibility of gay and bi. It's a common assumption you have to be gay or straight, but the reality is sexuality is fluid for many people and you should actually never define someone without being explicitly told. \n\nPeople who identify as bi often face issues in lgbtq+ communities for the same reason of some people will not accept they are capable of a heterosexual sexual relationship and accuse them of being closeted. It's a sore subject for many, which is likely why Tanner reacted strongly- he should not have to be made to justify a heterosexual relationship because of previous homosexual relationships, and vice versa. Some people find it exhausting, and brothers reactions kinda indicate OP's son is already dealing with it.\n\nNot to mention the whole discussing the ex in front of the current partner, which is just awkward for everyone, especially if the relationship is new and Tanner hasn't gotten into his previous relationships with his current gf.", "> Where does it say his son is bi? He\u2019s only dated the same sex and only talked about the same sex.\n\nThe same place it says he's gay.  I.e. nowhere, OP just made assumptions.", "....\n\nIt's literally the post. Furthermore, not every gay man uses the \"stereotypical\" language, and OP confirmed that includes his son. Both you and OP jumped to huge stereotypes to ignore the OP's son introduced Natasha as a romantic partner because obviously he couldn't be bi and must have been using outdated slang that he doesn't actually use normally.\n\nIt's a textbook example of bi-erasure and completely exhausting for people who identify as bi.", "I mean ahead of time. The son doesn't live at home (OP thought he had moved in with his ex-bf already) so to just show up for dinner with an extra person and no warning is really odd to me. OP was under the impression that he was still with his ex and that they would be moving in together. I can see how he would skim past the \"girlfriend\" comment because he thought he was in a serious relationship with someone else. There was only 1 indication and it was the girlfriend comment. There was no other convo, hint or anything to clue OP in. What repeated indications are you talking about?", "Based on Tanner's history that OP saw, it does make more sense. Whether we like it or not, it's unavoidable to make judgments and assumptions about other ppl. It's human nature to look at someone's behavior and have your mind supply a reasoning behind it. Oh, that person is wearing scrubs, so they probably work in the medical field. Oh, that person always chooses the meat-free option whenever we go out for lunch, so they're probably a vegetarian. Oh, my son has only dayed men for years, so he's probably gay. \n\nShould we make an effort to be conscious of our assumptions and recognize that they could be wrong? Absolutely. But most assumptions like that are going to be harmless, especially if we acknowledge when we're wrong and make an effort to respect the new information we learn about someone.", "> It's a problem because of bi-erasure. That he could be bi is a reasonable conclusion because OP literally had to ignore him introducing a gf to keep the misconception. OP is the one who implied his son wouldn't use the term gf casually as well.\n\n**You are waxing eloquent about bi erasure on the wrong forum.**\n\nThis is not that. I\u2019m sorry but it isn\u2019t. No, people shouldn\u2019t assume a guy is gay just because he has only dated guys.\n\n**But it is very clear that he NEITHER informed his dad that he had broken up with his previous ex, whom his dad thought he was going to MOVE IN WITH, nor that he was dating someone else, prior to bringing someone home.**\n\nAnd the term \u201cgirlfriend\u201d is absolutely used in contexts outside of dating. And it\u2019s still a logical conclusion to assume the he just picked up the phrase at school  when, as far as OP knows, he\u2019s *still dating a guy.*\n\n> By that same logic, there is no reason to assume Tanner is gay if he never says he is. There's equal possibility of gay and bi. It's a common assumption you have to be gay or straight, but the reality is sexuality is fluid for many people and you should actually never define someone without being explicitly told.\n\nWe all understand that, or we should. But that\u2019s not the issue at hand in OP\u2019s post. \n\n> People who identify as bi often face issues in lgbtq+ communities for the same reason of some people will not accept they are capable of a heterosexual sexual relationship and accuse them of being closeted. \n\nMost of us are aware.

They just misunderstood him.\n\n> Some people find it exhausting, and brothers reactions kinda indicate OP's son is already dealing with it.\n\nSure. But if he anticipated this, the least he could have done is give OP a heads up that they were bringing a PARTNER. And not the one OP clearly is under the impression they\u2019re with. \n\nI get that he shouldn\u2019t have to explain it, and that\u2019s honestly probably why he didn\u2019t say something beforehand, but it also isn\u2019t fair to his GIRLFRIEND to being her into a situation like that where their parents was totally not in the loop.\n\n> Not to mention the whole discussing the ex in front of the current partner, which is just awkward for everyone, especially if the relationship is new and Tanner hasn't gotten into his previous relationships with his current gf.\n\nWhich in my opinion was absolutely the son\u2019s fault, because he\u2019s the one who brought her and announced when they arrived that it was his girlfriend, knowing full well there was a chance would be a bit blindsided (rightly or wrongly is honestly irrelevant - in this case, it\u2019s family). And *especially* if he hasn\u2019t \u201cgotten into previous relationships\u201d with her. \n\n**Because - again - OP of course would NOT have brought up the ex if they were aware that they WERE the \u201cex.\u201d**\n\nMy take on this whole thing is that it was an honest mistake on OP\u2019s part, and either immaturely deliberate lack of communication, or just a general lack of foresight, on the son\u2019s part. \n\nNo one is genuinely an asshole here, but son definitely overreacted given the situation, in my opinion. As young adults often do. A little grace and understanding for family who you *know* are not behaving maliciously goes a long way.", "The only problem I see here is your Is virtue signaling. The dad can't know anything his son doesn't tell him. Since his son had only exclusively dated men, he made the reasonable mistake thinking that his son was gay.

I'm a straight woman, there have been a couple women over the years I have found attractive, but for the most part I am really not at all interested in women. It fascinates me that bi people get treated so poorly by both camps in a weird \"pick a side\" way. I haven't chosen to prefer men, and as far as I can tell, gay men don't choose to like men, and lesbians don't choose to like women, we just like who we like. I find it so weird how bisexuals are suddenly considered wishy washy choosers instead of just genuinely attracted to both.\n\nThat said, if you have only known someone to date one or the other, and they've never really even expressed any interest in the other, right or wrong you might just assume they are gay or straight. OP was dense here, but we don't know how Tanner was interacting with his gf. May have been projecting friend vibes, too. He'd clearly never mentioned her, which is kinda odd. I'd mention if I was being someone to my parents house, personally, especially if it was a romantic partner that may not be expected.

Son has also literally never before expressed to OP his interest in girls. The son didn\u2019t give OP enough information to be fair for him to realize this. He can\u2019t be mad at OP for not knowing he was bi when he literally never told OP he was. I think they\u2019re a bit oblivious, but not an ah. I think there\u2019s NAH.

That if a person is in a homosexual relationship with another person of the same sex and only has sexual relations with people of the same sex that makes them gay? Is that a bad stereotype to have?

I'm just saying that it seems incredibly generous of you to look at a man who expressly states that he just didn't notice multiple explicit statements because he assumed he already knew the truth and never bothered to ask any clarifying questions until far too late wouldn't have done the exact same thing before hand too.\n\nI think we have plenty of reason to believe that this is a kid who either A) does tell his dad things and knows he'll miss/ignore/forget them or B) DOESN'T tell his dad things BECAUSE he knows he'll miss/ignore/forget them.

But Tanner could have also clarified at any point as well. He also didn't communicate the breakup from his most recent boyfriend (who was apparently long-term enough that they were moving in together). It seems like there is just a major lack of communication on both parts and Tanner sort of expecting OP to read his mind or at least pay such close attention to his dating/sex live that OP would just know he was bi. \n\nTanner seems a little self centered and OP seems a little oblivious.

So many people, even friends of mine, have made jokes about me being straight and erased that side of me. And that hurt because they _knew_ I was bi.\n\nI agree with you here, the key difference is the knowing.\n\nOP says as far as they knew their son was gay, they thought he was still with his old partner and hadn't made the mental distinction of girl friend and girlfriend. But this doesn't make it bi-erasure. It sounds like the son never sat OP down and outright declared their sexuality, nor discussed anything that would have explained having a girlfriend and (in OP's mind) a boyfriend at the same time. There isn't anything in OP's experience with their son, at least that they've said to us, that is indicative of prior knowledge, awareness or experience of their son being bi. \n\nOP hasn't then turned around and said his son's relationships with men didn't count, and hasn't dismissed the girlfriend as some sort of beard. OP isn't erasing their son's identity, they are learning about it. This is new for them.\n\nAn allegory of sorts: If all the swans I had ever seen in the world in my lifetime up until now were white, I'd assume the next swan I see would also be white. I can't guarantee it would be, it could be green or purple or orange with polka dots, but I would feel very confident in assuming the next swan I saw would be white. No one has ever mentioned swans coming in other colours to me.\n\nMy limited experience of swan colours does limit my ability to predict what colour the next swan will be, but I don't know this, as I have only seen white swans.  For me to predict a purple swan when I'm only seeing white feathers everywhere would be so far out of left field that it doesn't make sense.\n\nAnd because I've only seen white swans, I don't immediately recognise the purple bird in front of me as a swan. I assumed all swans I saw would be white.\n\nAm I wrong for that assumption? Probably.\n\nIs that assumption still logical and understandable? Definitely.\n\nCan I be surprised at the existence of purple swans? Sure\n\nBut the important part is what happens with that surprise. \n\nDo I pretend purple swans don't exist now I've seen one? That this purple bird isn't a swan, but some other thing? Or think that all those white birds weren't swans in the first place, and that only this purple bird is a swan?\n\nNo, because that's the erasure - that's burying someone's identity.\n\nOr, do I take a moment to reconsider what colours swans could come in? And do I acknowledge that past history isn't always the best predictor for future actions, so I should be mindful about birds in other colours? Yes. \n\nAm I irredeemable for thinking swans came in white? No, you can be redeemed, because everyone has assumed that a bird only comes in one colour. Some might have thought pigeons were only ever grey, or all ducks had green heads.\n\nEvery single person has at some point made an assumption on a person's sexuality, and to pretend otherwise is lying to yourself. Whether it's assuming straight as the default, gay as the default, lesbian, asexual, pansexual and any other colour on the spectrum, an assumption has been made, based on a turn of phrase, tone of voice, haircut, fashion sense, whatever else. But it's what you do after realising that your assumption was wrong that matters.\n\nOP tried to apologise to their son, they tried to explain why they'd come to that conclusion in order to show it was a mistake and not malicious. OP isn't ignoring their son's identity, they were just ignorant of it.\n\nETA: [spelling]", "[removed]", "I think that misunderstandings are very easy to dissect in hindsight, or when laid out before us.

Nothing needs to be disclosed while casually dating unless they are having sex in which case anything that impacts health needs to be disclosed. Biracial is a little obvious once it gets serious and you meet the parents so hiding it would require hiding your family and all family pictures.

For biracial people that would be the culture of both their mother and their father, whereas for bisexuals it\u2019s the culture of gay people and straight people. My understanding is that both biracial people and bisexuals often experience \u201cnot fully fitting\u201d in either group and facing discrimination from both.\n\nAnd I honestly don\u2019t see how someone being bisexual has an impact on the nature of their romantic relationships, beyond the fact they can be with people of multiple genders. Like, other than their partner finding a wider variety of people hot, and maybe needing to care a bit more personally about LGBTQ issues, how does it affect someone that their partner is bisexual on a fundamental level?\n\nEdit: thank you for your response", "So if a bisexual person didn\u2019t consider their bisexuality a serious part of their identity, would it then be fine for them not to come out?\n\nEdit: I appreciate you taking the time to respond", "Fair enough lol", "Maybe other people would disagree but I consider that something integral to your identity vs race, culture, and religion are something that can shape your identity but might not be integral depending on the person. If someone had a mild religious upbringing that shaped their identity but they no longer practice it. Maybe it will eventually be talked about but it isn't something they are actively hiding or anything that would effect the relationship vs they grew up in more of a cult religion like COG or an extreme Christian group etc. Those can really effect identity and could greatly impact their future relationships and a serious partner should absolutely have a heads up. Depending on the person, the line between their identity vs their background might vary. I consider sexual orientation and gender identity as integral because they aren't really background but rather part of who you are for a potential serious relationship and can have an impact.\n\nFrom a medical standpoint it probably is also something that should be disclosed before sex, since he has had a recent male partner depending on their experiences together.

C'mon dad, I literally introduced Natasha as my girlfriend half an hour ago.\" Add a little \"how's your memory?\" joke if you want to lighten the conversation. \n\nIf he was so upset because he wasn't out to his girlfriend yet, *that* is something he should have mentioned prior to bringing her over so OP was aware.", "It was not malicious behaviour. When humans strongly believe something to be true, e.g. \"my son is gay not bisexual\", they ignore or adjust the evidence to suit this belief. It is unfortunate but not a conscious choice. Surely you have noticed this, it is extremely typical of human behaviour?", "Seems ODD that he would not have told his dad about his GF long ago and sent dad pics of her, and them together to confirm/affirm that at that moment he indeed had a girlfriend.\n\nInstead of showing up at his dad's home with a stranger in tow that is suddenly \"my gf\" with no preface at all.  Sketchy - dad's doubt is totally justified, since he NEVER ONCE brought a gf home before.", "Nope, homosexual means attracted to opposite sex/gender, bisexual means attracted to both sex/gender.

You would go with the knowledge that you have about the person. \n\nAlso to add, I have put my foot in my mouth multiple times thinking a girl was gay because they kept saying \u201cmy girlfriend and I\u201d, and after they saying that 5 times im not supposed to respond with \u201coh awesome, how long have you been together?\u201d", "Yeah girl friend is used by many people to mean friend that is a girl.

As it didn't, and the reaction perfectly fits the story of an awkward interaction, I think it's unlikely to be his reason.\n\nEdit to add:\n\n>It doesn't say that she looked angry or awkward but confused, like she didn't understand what was happening.\n\nI said it made sense that he (OP's son) felt awkward.", "The gf is probably confused why OP starts talking about son's ex when he clearly introduced her as his gf. Because I am also confused why OP didn't ask for clarification as soon as the word girlfriend popped up or why OP didn't just decide not to mention any partner until OP could ask for clarification when gf is out of earshot.

Definitely has the dad feeling of oh there is another one I can\u2019t keep up.", "Eh, that's not entirely accurate. Firstly, and this is a small but important correction, the commonly accepted definition of bisexuality in the community is \"an attraction to two or more genders\".\n\nSecondly, some (actually most) bisexuals are also homosexual. To be a homosexual, you just have to be attracted to the same gender as yourself. They are not mutually exclusive.", "_same_ sex/gender for homosexual but yes, it's otherwise clear", "Yeah that's what I interpreted. OP's son didn't previously refer to female friends as \"girlfriends\", which is more feminine language IMO. I didn't see any negative judgement from OP on feminine men, simply that's not their son.\n\nI'm queer, in a same-sex marriage and involved in LGBT+ communities so I'm not stereotyping, it's just a more feminine use of language to refer to \"girlfriends\". I'm a woman but not very femme, I wouldn't refer to female friends as \"girlfriends\" except in an ironic/joking way.", "I\u2019m straight and I dislike this.  This waitress got really chatty with my friends and I once and kept saying \u201cmy girlfriend and I\u201d, \u201coh my girlfriend also goes to that uni\u201d etc so I asked her how long they had been together.  I was thinking she was in a brand new relationship and was excited to talk about her girlfriend. \n\nShe got so upset that I thought she was gay and walked away. But everyone at the table agreed that it sounded like she was talking about a relationship.", "My mum always did too. I used it less frequently like that, but still do. \nBut it wouldn't surprise me if it were more common in OP's age range to use girl/boy friend that way", "Maybe but I think I'd also be confused if someone asked my bf if he was gonna be moving in with his ex. I don't think her being confused means too much", "If he wasn't out to her, he definitely should have given his family a heads up. It'd be way too easy to innocently mention a name or something in general conversation if you don't know you're meant to be omitting it.", "Yeah I'm bi and a girl so calling other girls girlfriends is kinda weird.i usually say friend instead.\n\nI think maybe the son got mad over bi erasure which happens when people assume someone is monosexual just because they used to date only one gender. And I can get how that could be annoying a little but I agree with who said OP couldn't know what he wasn't told. Now, obviously the son told OP but it was a misunderstanding. NTA", "Not true and not for all countries. In the UK it's not often I hear girls and women refer to their female friends as girlfriends. They just call them friends.", "I don't get this. What is bf exactly doing to the gf if he is bi instead of straight? What influence has it on the girlfriend? In what experience is he exactly tricking her? Or ino other words, what makes a relationship with a bi person different?", "Yeah we don't really use it that way in the UK anymore but older generations did. My mum (boomer) didn't realise which of my friends were lesbians for the longest time because when I mentioned their girlfriends she thought I meant their friends who are girls. I had to explain that my generation doesn't really use 'girlfriend' to refer to friends.", "There is no difference between the relationships (Except maybe an increased risk for sex depending on his recent history. I am a big believer in informed consent). The tricking part is hiding part of your identity so someone will keep dating you in a serious enough relationship to meet the parents. Maybe she won't care maybe she will, but she should get the choice on who she dates. \n\nThe caveat is that this is for serious relationships not casual dating.", "Yeah, that's why I said call their *girlfriends* that. As in their romantic partners. The women they date. Not their platonic friends.\n\nDo you think \"sapphic women\" or \"wlw\" would have been preferable to \"gay girl\"? I'm a lesbian, too, but call myself gay interchangeably, as do some of my bi female friends. I take it by the quotation marks it's the wrong thing to say? I'm also ESL so my knowledge of permissible umbrella terms is limited.", "Yeah my mother always used girlfriends for her friends as well", "But there are always many things you don't know about a person. You will literally never know. The only person it really matters to is biphobes/homophobes (or queerphobes I guess). And honestly, those are the people you really don't want to out yourself to. Plus, if they find it so important it is on them to be upfront that they don't want to date a queer person.\n\nIf it doesn't change the relationship, you aren't hiding anything. You are just moving on your own timeline when to tell something about your exes. When I don't give a list of all countries I have been to on vacation, you aren't saying \"I'm hiding that information\". Neither is a queer persoon hiding them being bi or any sexuality they might identify with. \n\nYour sexuality is just that, your sexuality. It isn't your personality and doesn't have to be a big part of who you are. I don't have to tell someone who I have dated and had sex with, and neither should a bi person.\n\nAlso, someone who had gay sex can just inform a partner about STDs if they have them. Gay sex doesn't have to be involved in that conversation. Just that you had unprotected sex and got it that way.", "Yes. That's why I said gay girls call their *girlfriends* that. As in their romantic partners. The women they date. Not their friends.", "I\u2019m pretty sure the quotes were used to\u2026what\u2019s the word. For example, if a newspaper wrote, the following:\n\nAttack On Mosque Declared \u201cHate Crime\u201d by FBI Task Force\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean the newspaper is arguing that what happened wasn\u2019t a hate crime. It\u2019s just making it clear that the FBI task force legit said \u201cthis is a hate crime.\u201d They\u2019re making sure that what the FBI task force said isn\u2019t open to interpretation.\n\nI mean, I could be wrong about what the quotes meant. Verbal, let alone written language, tends to be a total mess.", "As a bi person who has experience REAL bi-erasure. This is not it. This is a genuine mistake.", "Do you really want to be in a commited relationship with a bi/homo/queer phobe? Should a bi/homo/queer phobe be tricked into building a relationship with someone they despise? You don't have to know everything about someone but some things are integral to who they are. Sexuality is an integral part of your identity and while there may be a path to discovering it completely and it may appear to evolve over time it is a permanent aspect ingrained in who you are.  \n\nIf you are purposefully leaving \"countries\" off your list it is hiding not just forgetting a few places. Lying by omission is still lying. \n\nMedically it takes a couple months to be able to definitely test for HIV so someone wouldn't have to give details but just clarify that they have tested clear or are at low/moderate/high risk should be a sufficient level for informed consent.\n\nEdit: do you really not think it is important to know who the person you are seriously dating is? Identity, personality, child status, marital status, their desires in life. How do you know if you fit or want to continue dating? Someone being bi or queer isn't a deal breaker but someone hiding and lying about being bi or queer is. Someone telling you their sexual orientation is different from finding out they have been hiding it from you when you meet the parents. I would start to question what else they are hiding and if the relationship was a lie.", "Huh? Yes? I don\u2019t think I was disagreeing with what you were saying. I thought I was basically saying \u201cditto\u201d to what you wrote.", "Hmm, yes, hard to say. To me it reads as questioning both the content of the comment and the nomenclature, but could well be just a neutral quotation.\n\nBut yeah, by \"Even gay girls call their **girlfriends** \\[= not friends\\] that!\" I mean, \"even sapphic women call their romantic partners their girlfriends\" in contrast to the general assumption of \"when women refer to other women as girlfriends, they mean their platonic female friends\" that erases the existence of women who use that in a romantic sense. But my word choices are probably questionable.", "I am also enjoying this discussion. But to your point, I would consider sexual orientation and gender identity not to be that dissimilar to race, culture and religion. It\u2019s not at all uncommon for someone to be LGBTQ+ and not consider that at the forefront of their identity. They may not be very involved in the queer community, or just feel that there are more important aspects of their personality. Some bisexual people only ever have experiences with one gender. Some trans people realize and start living as their actual gender at a young age. These things may make them less connected to the community. Or more. There\u2019s a wide variety of experiences that people react to in different ways. \n\nAs a parallel to your religious example, I would present a bisexual person who hooked up with a few people of multiple genders when they were younger, but then got married to someone of the opposite gender and didn\u2019t really interact with other LGBTQ people after that. A person like that may regard their sexuality as something more similar to a \u201clapsed religion\u201d. That\u2019s not to say everyone who has that experience will, but some may. Or compare someone who only occasionally is attracted to the same gender. Some of those people would consider themselves to be straight and their few exceptions don\u2019t count. Some people with the same preferences may consider themselves bisexual. Essentially I\u2019m trying to say that no one size fits all. \n\nAlso, something to consider is that someone may consider something a small part of their identity at some point, but then have it become a larger one later. Someone may distance themselves from their cultural identity for a number of years to the point that they never mention it, but then rediscover it later in life. Or someone whose religious beliefs lapsed could become more religious as they age. Or someone whose sexuality was never too important to them could find that they want to be more open with that part of themselves. \n\nAll of this to say that, I agree that if something is an important part of someone\u2019s identity that as a general rule they should share it with their partner. However, I am reluctant to put down hard and fast rules for these sorts of things because there can be a lot of variations in how people see aspects of themselves and what situations they find themselves in."]}
