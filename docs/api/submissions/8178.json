I love you and your girlfriend seems lovely.\" At this point, continuing to justify what you did and said is continuing to risk sticking your foot in your mouth, whereas simply offering a straightforward apology for the mistake and an acknowledgment of what your son was trying to share with you is probably the best way to make sure he KEEPS sharing things with you.

No. As a bi dude myself I get how it can suck to have people disregard your relationships as you being \u2018wishy-washy\u2019 or how \u2018you just can\u2019t make up your mind\u2019, but that\u2019s not what was happening here.", "Yeah like, all of this could have been avoided if the son had just given them a heads up that he was bringing someone over and it was a girl. I'm all for fighting bi-erasure, but I don't think OP was wrong for assuming his son was gay if he's only every talked about boy crushes and only ever dated boys. OP's son is young so it probably explains a lot of this, but he really should have seen this coming. A quick phone call of \"so-and-so and I aren't dating anymore and also I'm dating a new person her name is such-and-such and I'd like to bring her over for dinner\" and gotten all of this out of the way ahead of time.", "That's kinda my point though. If your parents suck, are nosy and controlling etc, why even bring a partner home? This wasn't a circumstance that just came up. OPs son deliberately decided to bring his girlfriend home and didn't give them any pre-warning that ANYONE was coming over, let alone that he'd broken up with his ex-bf that he was in a serious relationship with and was dating this new person. \n\nI hear you on nosy parents, I didn't keep mine updated on my dating life and only introduced 2 people to them. But then if we assume that OP sucks and is a shit father, it begs the question, why is the son introducing his new gf to his family and expecting them to just KNOW what's going on?", "Theres a very obvious reason why you're getting downvoted so much and I think you need to figure out why before continuing in the comments", "I mean considering OP literally didn't know who his son was dating at the time we can pretty clearly guess they don't have that level of communication but also in my case yeah!\n\nWhen I brought home my wife for the first time all I told my parents was \"I have a date coming by tonight, so I'll make us all dinner, but I may not be around much after that.\" And then that was that! I was an adult, in college, with a job, and only living at home because the school year was out of session, so as far as any of us were concerned there wasn't anything much else to talk about.\n\nOnce my wife and I got more serious, we all definitely had more in depth conversations! But that was well over a year later and still very much more me telling my parents things, less them asking me questions. At the time, it just didn't seem like the time or the place. I was old enough that I didn't need my parents protectively interviewing me or my partner about our relationship, and while I was there to see my parents, my partner was there *with me* not *to be introduced to them* which is a minor but important distinction that seems to be present here in this story too. Many older teens (18/19) will sort of let their life casually unfold in their parents' presence rather than officially informing them of it until such time as they decide there is something to officially inform of. It's a stylistic choice I think more than anything, and tends to happen most in families that raise sort of \"live and let live\" kids, whether on purpose or on accident.\n\nMy parents very much did that on purpose! Not everyone who develops that approach did so because their parents meant for them to. I genuinely don't know if OP intended to be so hands off in his approach to knowing what goes on in his son's love life. But queer kid's especially tend more towards that hands off-ness due to early fears and anxieties about acceptance (yes, even if our parents end up being accepting, we often still fear it, hell, my mother was literally married to another woman and I was still hesitant about coming out to them because they were never quiet about \"assuming\" my straightness and it can be scary to go against that). So it may not have been entirely OPs choice. But it also may have been! If OP and his son have struggled with their conversations about his son's love life in the past, this lack of communication now is likely a bit inevitable (though it doesn't have to stay that way! The more OP is open to communicating, asking non-shaming questions, and being genuinely engaged, the more likely that distance shrinks).\n\nAnyway, I realize that's a lot of words to answer your question, but it's a pretty complex situation I think!", "But neither did Tanner ever say to OP \"Dad I'm gay\". Dad made that assumption all on his own. And as I'm sure we've all heard, when we assume, we make an ass out of u and me.", "In my case, because I'm not close with my family I didn't bring home just whoever I was dating. Only if we had been together for a while and intended for it to last. In total I've dated about 8ish people (depending on your definition of dating), I've only brought 2 home. My parents have incidentally met other people I've dated when they visited me in college once or twice but I didn't let them know we were dating because it wasn't serious and so it didn't concern them. \n\nMaybe I view things more black and white, but if OPs son isn't close enough to his parents to tell them who he's dating, then why is he bringing them home? In my experience, you only bring them home to foster a relationship with your family because you think this person is going to be around for a while. It doesn't sound like this relationship has been going on for very long... But maybe the son doesn't think of it like that and was just thinking of the free meal they could both have, who knows. But ultimately I think OP is NTA and the son really could have done some work to avoid that awkwardness. If he's going to be bringing a new person home he should give his parents a heads up.", "The son didn't even tell his father that he and his boyfriend had broken up \u2013 OP assumed they were still in a relationship. With that info, I never would have skipped to the conclusion that Tanner and Natasha could be a couple.", "He did though. OP literally said so. That's the thing. He was given repeated indications that he just breezed right by because he *wasn't paying attention*", "> You can't expect OP to know Tanner is bi if Tanner never says he is.\n\nHe never said he was gay, but for some reason you think OP should assume that means gay instead of bi?", "It's a problem because of bi-erasure. That he could be bi is a reasonable conclusion because OP literally had to ignore him introducing a gf to keep the misconception. OP is the one who implied his son wouldn't use the term gf casually as well. \n\nBy that same logic, there is no reason to assume Tanner is gay if he never says he is. There's equal possibility of gay and bi. It's a common assumption you have to be gay or straight, but the reality is sexuality is fluid for many people and you should actually never define someone without being explicitly told. \n\nPeople who identify as bi often face issues in lgbtq+ communities for the same reason of some people will not accept they are capable of a heterosexual sexual relationship and accuse them of being closeted. It's a sore subject for many, which is likely why Tanner reacted strongly- he should not have to be made to justify a heterosexual relationship because of previous homosexual relationships, and vice versa. Some people find it exhausting, and brothers reactions kinda indicate OP's son is already dealing with it.\n\nNot to mention the whole discussing the ex in front of the current partner, which is just awkward for everyone, especially if the relationship is new and Tanner hasn't gotten into his previous relationships with his current gf.", "> Where does it say his son is bi? He\u2019s only dated the same sex and only talked about the same sex.\n\nThe same place it says he's gay.  I.e. nowhere, OP just made assumptions.", "....\n\nIt's literally the post. Furthermore, not every gay man uses the \"stereotypical\" language, and OP confirmed that includes his son. Both you and OP jumped to huge stereotypes to ignore the OP's son introduced Natasha as a romantic partner because obviously he couldn't be bi and must have been using outdated slang that he doesn't actually use normally.\n\nIt's a textbook example of bi-erasure and completely exhausting for people who identify as bi.", "I mean ahead of time. The son doesn't live at home (OP thought he had moved in with his ex-bf already) so to just show up for dinner with an extra person and no warning is really odd to me. OP was under the impression that he was still with his ex and that they would be moving in together. I can see how he would skim past the \"girlfriend\" comment because he thought he was in a serious relationship with someone else. There was only 1 indication and it was the girlfriend comment. There was no other convo, hint or anything to clue OP in. What repeated indications are you talking about?", "Based on Tanner's history that OP saw, it does make more sense. Whether we like it or not, it's unavoidable to make judgments and assumptions about other ppl. It's human nature to look at someone's behavior and have your mind supply a reasoning behind it. Oh, that person is wearing scrubs, so they probably work in the medical field. Oh, that person always chooses the meat-free option whenever we go out for lunch, so they're probably a vegetarian. Oh, my son has only dayed men for years, so he's probably gay. \n\nShould we make an effort to be conscious of our assumptions and recognize that they could be wrong? Absolutely. But most assumptions like that are going to be harmless, especially if we acknowledge when we're wrong and make an effort to respect the new information we learn about someone.", "> It's a problem because of bi-erasure. That he could be bi is a reasonable conclusion because OP literally had to ignore him introducing a gf to keep the misconception. OP is the one who implied his son wouldn't use the term gf casually as well.\n\n**You are waxing eloquent about bi erasure on the wrong forum.**\n\nThis is not that. I\u2019m sorry but it isn\u2019t. No, people shouldn\u2019t assume a guy is gay just because he has only dated guys.\n\n**But it is very clear that he NEITHER informed his dad that he had broken up with his previous ex, whom his dad thought he was going to MOVE IN WITH, nor that he was dating someone else, prior to bringing someone home.**\n\nAnd the term \u201cgirlfriend\u201d is absolutely used in contexts outside of dating. And it\u2019s still a logical conclusion to assume the he just picked up the phrase at school  when, as far as OP knows, he\u2019s *still dating a guy.*\n\n> By that same logic, there is no reason to assume Tanner is gay if he never says he is. There's equal possibility of gay and bi. It's a common assumption you have to be gay or straight, but the reality is sexuality is fluid for many people and you should actually never define someone without being explicitly told.\n\nWe all understand that, or we should. But that\u2019s not the issue at hand in OP\u2019s post. \n\n> People who identify as bi often face issues in lgbtq+ communities for the same reason of some people will not accept they are capable of a heterosexual sexual relationship and accuse them of being closeted. \n\nMost of us are aware.

They just misunderstood him.\n\n> Some people find it exhausting, and brothers reactions kinda indicate OP's son is already dealing with it.\n\nSure. But if he anticipated this, the least he could have done is give OP a heads up that they were bringing a PARTNER. And not the one OP clearly is under the impression they\u2019re with. \n\nI get that he shouldn\u2019t have to explain it, and that\u2019s honestly probably why he didn\u2019t say something beforehand, but it also isn\u2019t fair to his GIRLFRIEND to being her into a situation like that where their parents was totally not in the loop.\n\n> Not to mention the whole discussing the ex in front of the current partner, which is just awkward for everyone, especially if the relationship is new and Tanner hasn't gotten into his previous relationships with his current gf.\n\nWhich in my opinion was absolutely the son\u2019s fault, because he\u2019s the one who brought her and announced when they arrived that it was his girlfriend, knowing full well there was a chance would be a bit blindsided (rightly or wrongly is honestly irrelevant - in this case, it\u2019s family). And *especially* if he hasn\u2019t \u201cgotten into previous relationships\u201d with her. \n\n**Because - again - OP of course would NOT have brought up the ex if they were aware that they WERE the \u201cex.\u201d**\n\nMy take on this whole thing is that it was an honest mistake on OP\u2019s part, and either immaturely deliberate lack of communication, or just a general lack of foresight, on the son\u2019s part. \n\nNo one is genuinely an asshole here, but son definitely overreacted given the situation, in my opinion. As young adults often do. A little grace and understanding for family who you *know* are not behaving maliciously goes a long way.", "The only problem I see here is your Is virtue signaling. The dad can't know anything his son doesn't tell him. Since his son had only exclusively dated men, he made the reasonable mistake thinking that his son was gay.

I'm a straight woman, there have been a couple women over the years I have found attractive, but for the most part I am really not at all interested in women. It fascinates me that bi people get treated so poorly by both camps in a weird \"pick a side\" way. I haven't chosen to prefer men, and as far as I can tell, gay men don't choose to like men, and lesbians don't choose to like women, we just like who we like. I find it so weird how bisexuals are suddenly considered wishy washy choosers instead of just genuinely attracted to both.\n\nThat said, if you have only known someone to date one or the other, and they've never really even expressed any interest in the other, right or wrong you might just assume they are gay or straight. OP was dense here, but we don't know how Tanner was interacting with his gf. May have been projecting friend vibes, too. He'd clearly never mentioned her, which is kinda odd. I'd mention if I was being someone to my parents house, personally, especially if it was a romantic partner that may not be expected.

Son has also literally never before expressed to OP his interest in girls. The son didn\u2019t give OP enough information to be fair for him to realize this. He can\u2019t be mad at OP for not knowing he was bi when he literally never told OP he was. I think they\u2019re a bit oblivious, but not an ah. I think there\u2019s NAH.

That if a person is in a homosexual relationship with another person of the same sex and only has sexual relations with people of the same sex that makes them gay? Is that a bad stereotype to have?

I'm just saying that it seems incredibly generous of you to look at a man who expressly states that he just didn't notice multiple explicit statements because he assumed he already knew the truth and never bothered to ask any clarifying questions until far too late wouldn't have done the exact same thing before hand too.\n\nI think we have plenty of reason to believe that this is a kid who either A) does tell his dad things and knows he'll miss/ignore/forget them or B) DOESN'T tell his dad things BECAUSE he knows he'll miss/ignore/forget them.

But Tanner could have also clarified at any point as well. He also didn't communicate the breakup from his most recent boyfriend (who was apparently long-term enough that they were moving in together). It seems like there is just a major lack of communication on both parts and Tanner sort of expecting OP to read his mind or at least pay such close attention to his dating/sex live that OP would just know he was bi. \n\nTanner seems a little self centered and OP seems a little oblivious.

So many people, even friends of mine, have made jokes about me being straight and erased that side of me. And that hurt because they _knew_ I was bi.\n\nI agree with you here, the key difference is the knowing.\n\nOP says as far as they knew their son was gay, they thought he was still with his old partner and hadn't made the mental distinction of girl friend and girlfriend. But this doesn't make it bi-erasure. It sounds like the son never sat OP down and outright declared their sexuality, nor discussed anything that would have explained having a girlfriend and (in OP's mind) a boyfriend at the same time. There isn't anything in OP's experience with their son, at least that they've said to us, that is indicative of prior knowledge, awareness or experience of their son being bi. \n\nOP hasn't then turned around and said his son's relationships with men didn't count, and hasn't dismissed the girlfriend as some sort of beard. OP isn't erasing their son's identity, they are learning about it. This is new for them.\n\nAn allegory of sorts: If all the swans I had ever seen in the world in my lifetime up until now were white, I'd assume the next swan I see would also be white. I can't guarantee it would be, it could be green or purple or orange with polka dots, but I would feel very confident in assuming the next swan I saw would be white. No one has ever mentioned swans coming in other colours to me.\n\nMy limited experience of swan colours does limit my ability to predict what colour the next swan will be, but I don't know this, as I have only seen white swans.  For me to predict a purple swan when I'm only seeing white feathers everywhere would be so far out of left field that it doesn't make sense.\n\nAnd because I've only seen white swans, I don't immediately recognise the purple bird in front of me as a swan. I assumed all swans I saw would be white.\n\nAm I wrong for that assumption? Probably.\n\nIs that assumption still logical and understandable? Definitely.\n\nCan I be surprised at the existence of purple swans? Sure\n\nBut the important part is what happens with that surprise. \n\nDo I pretend purple swans don't exist now I've seen one? That this purple bird isn't a swan, but some other thing? Or think that all those white birds weren't swans in the first place, and that only this purple bird is a swan?\n\nNo, because that's the erasure - that's burying someone's identity.\n\nOr, do I take a moment to reconsider what colours swans could come in? And do I acknowledge that past history isn't always the best predictor for future actions, so I should be mindful about birds in other colours? Yes. \n\nAm I irredeemable for thinking swans came in white? No, you can be redeemed, because everyone has assumed that a bird only comes in one colour. Some might have thought pigeons were only ever grey, or all ducks had green heads.\n\nEvery single person has at some point made an assumption on a person's sexuality, and to pretend otherwise is lying to yourself. Whether it's assuming straight as the default, gay as the default, lesbian, asexual, pansexual and any other colour on the spectrum, an assumption has been made, based on a turn of phrase, tone of voice, haircut, fashion sense, whatever else. But it's what you do after realising that your assumption was wrong that matters.\n\nOP tried to apologise to their son, they tried to explain why they'd come to that conclusion in order to show it was a mistake and not malicious. OP isn't ignoring their son's identity, they were just ignorant of it.\n\nETA: [spelling]", "[removed]", "I think that misunderstandings are very easy to dissect in hindsight, or when laid out before us. That said, it\u2019s really not as simple in the moment.

NAH", "I'll just jump in and mention pan erasure as well! \n\nI used to say I was bisexual until I had an NB partner, so I started using \"pansexual\" instead and felt like it fit better. \n\nOpen to all/any/whatever! \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc99", "He didn\u2019t \u201cnot believe\u201d him he made an assumption that many others would too", "If the son had been gay as OP believed but OP leaped to the assumption anyway that he was dating women, you would call him an AH for not respecting the son's sexuality.\n\nMany people I know use girlfriends to mean friends or partners depending on context. OP didn't have the full context that his son was actually bi.\n\nThis is an awkward miscommunication with NAH.", "So if I, a heterosexual woman, introduce you to my girlfriend, does that tell you that I am gay?", "I find us English seems to commonly use girlfriend to mean friend who is a girl rather than female partner. It definitely catches me out occasionally.", "This may be a generational thing. I\u2019m a straight woman. I refer to my friends as girlfriends. I always have. But I did have a younger coworker get confused about that.", "To be fair, the dad didn\u2019t know if the son said girlfriend or girl friend.", "I don\u2019t think \u201cdecided\u201d is the right word. If he understood his son to be gay, which is where the confusion is, then being a literal girlfriend was probably so far outside of his frame of reference it would have never entered his mind as a possibility. Looks like he just didn\u2019t know his son was bi and nothing malicious happened here. NAH", "If you've ever been around any sort of women or even some gay men, then you'd know that they call their friends who are girls, girlfriends, at times.", "Normally I would agree but in this case they are dating and seriously enough to be introduced to the parents. If something that integral to your identity hasn't been brought up by then there is a problem.", "Yeah I agree. Also Tanner is an *adult* now, time to grow up and communicate with your parents if you don\u2019t want miscommunication like this to happen.", "this made me cackle", "This. I'm a female who says \"girlfriend\" when talking about my female friends. If a man I presumed to be gay said it, I'd assume they meant it this way.", "Where I live, girls phrase it that way all the time but not romantically. It\u2019s just their friends. I had one helluva time getting used to it when I first moved up here.", "I think NTA, son is TA for way overreacting when the misunderstanding was due to information he didn\u2019t communicate. \n\n1. Son brought over his girlfriend without letting his dad know ahead of time that he\u2019s broken up with his ex and is bringing over someone he\u2019s now dating. A heads up is usually warranted in this kind of situation.\n\n2. Son never told his father that he was also interested in women. He\u2019s comfortable bringing his gf unannounced, so it stands to reason he would be comfortable telling his father that he\u2019s bi. Again, no heads up given. \n\n3. The situation was a clear misunderstanding, but son yelled, got mad, and won\u2019t listen, even though he\u2019s the one that didn\u2019t provide the pertinent information.", "I really don\u2019t like putting a timeline on coming out. I think the queer person themselves should get to choose when come out, period. If it\u2019s later into a relationship that does risk the partner feeling hurt that their partner didn\u2019t share their identity earlier, but I think that\u2019s a choice each queer person should be allowed to make for themselves. Either way, it sucks if the son was outed. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ok to dismiss that by saying \u201cwell he should have told her by now anyways\u201d.", "I use gal-friend and guy-friend for platonic relationships. It avoids confusion.", "If you already have a preconceived notion, it\u2019s very easy to mishear things or interpret things in a way that it fits your narrative. Since OP thought his son only liked boys, he only thought it was weird he called Natasha \u201chis\u201d girlfriend, but still thought she was a friend.", "Coming out in general is different from hiding who you are from someone your seriously dating. That is tricking someone into dating you. It isn't an action that only effects you but something you are doing to someone else. Most people consider meeting the parents an indicator of serious dating, and would be upset or feel manipulated that their partner hid a major aspect of their identity. Very different from generally coming out which should always be on someone's own timeline or even what needs to be disclosed for casual dating.", "My group of friends just reversed the compound word.\n\nFriendboy and friendgirl meant friends", "I've even heard really camp gay guys call each other \"girlfriends\".", "I wouldn't", "Hence \u201cNAH\u201d because the ambiguity does make sense here.", "I would disagree that not updating your parents on your identity is self-centered but alright. I\u2019m going out on a limb and giving Tanner the benefit of the doubt: generally disconnected from his family until he comes to visit, at which point he communicates the relevant information, not realizing that the phrasing can be ambiguous, and getting frustrated at the misunderstanding when he thought he had communicated clearly. In my mind that\u2019s all this is. No one\u2019s an AH for not keeping up with their family if the dynamic just happens to be like that - but if we are pointing fingers communication is a two-way street and OP could have easily inquired about and gotten this information sooner. It seems the dynamic just isn\u2019t that close between those two. Idk how that makes Tanner TA \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb", "Honestly this. I'm straight. I've always dated men. Im currently in a long term relationship with a man.  If I brought a girl over to my parents and introduced her \"this is my girlfriend suzy\" they would not immediately assume I was bi. They would probably guess female friend unless I told them otherwise. \n\nWhy would they assume I'm bi?  There has been no indication of that and I never told them that. \n\nSon here overreacted to a misunderstanding. Dad wasn't ignoring the existence of bi people, he was never given any indication that his son was bi. And girlfriend has a much wider range of meaning than boyfriend. It's just English being dumb and ambiguous. \n\nIf son didn't want a miscommunication he probably should have communicated.", "Just like OP, who is NTA lol", "Well I don\u2019t know you now do I?", "Except it doesn\u2019t. \n\nThe appropriate, non-asshole thing to do would be to inform your parent that you broke up with your previous partner and ASK if you can bring your new partner. \n\nThe second Tanner brought a new partner without asking/informing that he was bringing a new partner and that he and Corbin broke up he became the asshole and solely responsible for everything else that followed.", "If Tanner expected OP to know he was bi with only the context of his previous relationships to go off of, and still expected OP to pick up on his sexuality while being disconnected/not communicating that proactively, then that's where the self-centeredness comes into play. \n\nIt's almost like Tanner is thinking \"my sexuality should be incredibly obvious to anyone who pays immediate and undivided attention to me and my habits. Regardless of my past physical examples of relationships, if you are focusing on me, then you'll just know I'm bi.\" It's a very childish/teenage thing to believe your parent's world revolves around you. It's not uncommon though. I'm not saying this is his exact thought process, but I do think many people in OPs shoes would have made the exact same mistake given the same information.\n\nAnd as you said, no one is an AH for not keeping up with their family if the dynamic just happens to be like that - but if we are pointing fingers, communication is a two-way street and TANNER could have easily INFORMED OP about and GIVEN this information sooner. And frankly with Tanner's reaction to this, I could also see him being upset with OP \"prying\" into his business if he had asked about his sexuality out of the blue.\n\nI don't think Tanner is necessarily an AH, but I don't think OP is either. Tanner ran the risk of using ambiguous language and not clarifying his position, and he got angry when OP missed his subtle context clues.", "Am pan and both loath it and so it. Is it contagious to taking pansexual as a class"]}
