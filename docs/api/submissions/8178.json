At dinner Saturday night I asked about how his  apparent ex Corbin was doing and if they had moved in yet not realizing yet they clearly broke up.  \n\nMy other boys apparently got it already and started snickering and Natasha looked confused while Tanner got mad. I  finally noticed Tanner getting upset and  asked what was wrong and he yelled at me about how he  introduced Natasha as his girlfriend when they got there and I had an oh shit moment. I tried talking to him Sunday before they left  and I tried to explain that I  hadn't realized and gets mad and tells me again that he literally introduced her as is girlfriend.

Not in a nosey way. He obviously shouldn\u2019t expect you to know anything he hasn\u2019t told you (which is why I feel his reaction makes him the AH here). \n\nHowever, it makes me wonder if there is any reason he hasn\u2019t shared any of this information with you before, both about being bisexual and going through a breakup. Perhaps there is a need to build more trust and openness between you both, or more initiative on your end to know your son better.\n\nI don\u2019t mean that to sound rude or to discredit you as a father. Just stating something to consider, if you haven\u2019t already.\n\nBest wishes to you. \ud83d\udc99", "NTA. You didn\u2019t mean it maliciously, you went off of all the knowledge you had. If your son hadn\u2019t bothered telling you him and his ex had broke up, how were you to know? Have a chat with him and maybe just apologise to the girlfriend and say you genuinely didn\u2019t know and had an \u2018oh shit\u2019 moment.", "Look. As a bisexual, I have known a lot of older folks who decide to assume once they know I like the same sex that I must be gay and literally never consider the possibility of bisexuality because (and this is the shitty part) they don't think it exists. Only gay or straight. I don't know if that's you so I'm not accusing you of it.\n\nBut when your son comes home with a girl that he literally introduces to you as his girlfriend and you keep making comments full of stereotypes (\"he never was very feminine\") while skimming right over the actual words coming out of his mouth and never bothering to take a minute to clarify them, that's probably the nerve you stepped on.\n\nI don't think you meant to be TA. But I do think you accidentally acted like people who definitely are. It's up to you if you keep trying to convince him that you aren't an asshole or if you simply tell him \"I'm sorry I hurt your feelings and didn't pay close enough attention to what you told me. I love you and your girlfriend seems lovely.\" At this point, continuing to justify what you did and said is continuing to risk sticking your foot in your mouth, whereas simply offering a straightforward apology for the mistake and an acknowledgment of what your son was trying to share with you is probably the best way to make sure he KEEPS sharing things with you. I think a lot of people get stuck on trying to prove they didn't mean harm when all that's really needed is acknowledging that harm happened anyway and moving on with the day.", "NTA.  It sounds like a very confusing situation.  I admire you for caring and trying to be involved in your son\u2019s life.  Keep trying.", "NAH - it's a misunderstanding. He'll get over it.", "NAH. I mean, at the moment I'm sure you are to Tanner, but this is seriously going to be hilarious down the road.", "I'm leaning NAH, with maybe a soft YTA for the lack of tact before you were sure what the circumstances were. Obviously you can't be expected to know things without being told and you made some incorrect assumptions, but all you can really do is apologize and hopefully he'll realize that it was just a misunderstanding and let his anger go.", "NTA just a misunderstanding... Let him cool af..tell him you didn't know he was bi", "Mild YTA. You didn\u2019t mean to engage in bi erasure, but you did.", "gentle YTA. \n\nthere was nothing malicious in it, but if you were confused when he introduced her as his girlfriend, that was the time to ask.\n\n\n\"oh, the two of you are dating? lovely to meet you\"", "Idk you\u2019re kinda TA.  Yes it slipped but if he says she\u2019s his girlfriend yeah let me put my son on blast that he\u2019s gay/bi in front of her and embarrass your son.", "NTA it's hard to keep up, sometimes.", "YTA for assuming your kid was lying to you when he told you he brought his gf.", "YTA.  Guys do not apply the term girlfriend unless that is a situation where the two of them are bumping uglies.  Even gay guys do have girlfriends (have regular sexual relations with females) sometimes.  It's rare, but it happens.  Even if he was on record for the whole family stating he was 100% gay (which is not the case)\n\nHis announcing a girlfriend clued everybody else into the situation.  Your comments about his recent boyfriend, in context, were quite...inappropriate.", "NTA\n\nSounds like an honest mistake. But next time try to avoid talking about exes just in case..", "I\u2019m leaning NTA because it was a misunderstanding, but maybe you could have asked him privately?

He\u2019s only dated the same sex and only talked about the same sex.\n\nIf a gay man introduced me to his girl friend I would assume she was his girl who is a friend.

It would be one thing if the son said he was bi and OP is just ignoring that bc he only sees his son date guys, but it sounds like Tanner waan't explicit about his secuality. You can't expect OP to know Tanner is bi if Tanner never says he is."]}
