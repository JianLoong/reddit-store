Perhaps there is a need to build more trust and openness between you both, or more initiative on your end to know your son better.\n\nI don\u2019t mean that to sound rude or to discredit you as a father.

I love you and your girlfriend seems lovely.\" At this point, continuing to justify what you did and said is continuing to risk sticking your foot in your mouth, whereas simply offering a straightforward apology for the mistake and an acknowledgment of what your son was trying to share with you is probably the best way to make sure he KEEPS sharing things with you.

No. As a bi dude myself I get how it can suck to have people disregard your relationships as you being \u2018wishy-washy\u2019 or how \u2018you just can\u2019t make up your mind\u2019, but that\u2019s not what was happening here.", "Yeah like, all of this could have been avoided if the son had just given them a heads up that he was bringing someone over and it was a girl. I'm all for fighting bi-erasure, but I don't think OP was wrong for assuming his son was gay if he's only every talked about boy crushes and only ever dated boys. OP's son is young so it probably explains a lot of this, but he really should have seen this coming. A quick phone call of \"so-and-so and I aren't dating anymore and also I'm dating a new person her name is such-and-such and I'd like to bring her over for dinner\" and gotten all of this out of the way ahead of time.", "That's kinda my point though. If your parents suck, are nosy and controlling etc, why even bring a partner home? This wasn't a circumstance that just came up. OPs son deliberately decided to bring his girlfriend home and didn't give them any pre-warning that ANYONE was coming over, let alone that he'd broken up with his ex-bf that he was in a serious relationship with and was dating this new person. \n\nI hear you on nosy parents, I didn't keep mine updated on my dating life and only introduced 2 people to them. But then if we assume that OP sucks and is a shit father, it begs the question, why is the son introducing his new gf to his family and expecting them to just KNOW what's going on?", "Theres a very obvious reason why you're getting downvoted so much and I think you need to figure out why before continuing in the comments", "I mean considering OP literally didn't know who his son was dating at the time we can pretty clearly guess they don't have that level of communication but also in my case yeah!\n\nWhen I brought home my wife for the first time all I told my parents was \"I have a date coming by tonight, so I'll make us all dinner, but I may not be around much after that.\" And then that was that! I was an adult, in college, with a job, and only living at home because the school year was out of session, so as far as any of us were concerned there wasn't anything much else to talk about.\n\nOnce my wife and I got more serious, we all definitely had more in depth conversations! But that was well over a year later and still very much more me telling my parents things, less them asking me questions. At the time, it just didn't seem like the time or the place. I was old enough that I didn't need my parents protectively interviewing me or my partner about our relationship, and while I was there to see my parents, my partner was there *with me* not *to be introduced to them* which is a minor but important distinction that seems to be present here in this story too. Many older teens (18/19) will sort of let their life casually unfold in their parents' presence rather than officially informing them of it until such time as they decide there is something to officially inform of. It's a stylistic choice I think more than anything, and tends to happen most in families that raise sort of \"live and let live\" kids, whether on purpose or on accident.\n\nMy parents very much did that on purpose! Not everyone who develops that approach did so because their parents meant for them to. I genuinely don't know if OP intended to be so hands off in his approach to knowing what goes on in his son's love life. But queer kid's especially tend more towards that hands off-ness due to early fears and anxieties about acceptance (yes, even if our parents end up being accepting, we often still fear it, hell, my mother was literally married to another woman and I was still hesitant about coming out to them because they were never quiet about \"assuming\" my straightness and it can be scary to go against that). So it may not have been entirely OPs choice. But it also may have been! If OP and his son have struggled with their conversations about his son's love life in the past, this lack of communication now is likely a bit inevitable (though it doesn't have to stay that way! The more OP is open to communicating, asking non-shaming questions, and being genuinely engaged, the more likely that distance shrinks).\n\nAnyway, I realize that's a lot of words to answer your question, but it's a pretty complex situation I think!", "But neither did Tanner ever say to OP \"Dad I'm gay\". Dad made that assumption all on his own. And as I'm sure we've all heard, when we assume, we make an ass out of u and me.", "In my case, because I'm not close with my family I didn't bring home just whoever I was dating. Only if we had been together for a while and intended for it to last. In total I've dated about 8ish people (depending on your definition of dating), I've only brought 2 home. My parents have incidentally met other people I've dated when they visited me in college once or twice but I didn't let them know we were dating because it wasn't serious and so it didn't concern them. \n\nMaybe I view things more black and white, but if OPs son isn't close enough to his parents to tell them who he's dating, then why is he bringing them home? In my experience, you only bring them home to foster a relationship with your family because you think this person is going to be around for a while. It doesn't sound like this relationship has been going on for very long... But maybe the son doesn't think of it like that and was just thinking of the free meal they could both have, who knows. But ultimately I think OP is NTA and the son really could have done some work to avoid that awkwardness. If he's going to be bringing a new person home he should give his parents a heads up.", "The son didn't even tell his father that he and his boyfriend had broken up \u2013 OP assumed they were still in a relationship. With that info, I never would have skipped to the conclusion that Tanner and Natasha could be a couple.", "He did though. OP literally said so. That's the thing. He was given repeated indications that he just breezed right by because he *wasn't paying attention*", "> You can't expect OP to know Tanner is bi if Tanner never says he is.\n\nHe never said he was gay, but for some reason you think OP should assume that means gay instead of bi?", "It's a problem because of bi-erasure. That he could be bi is a reasonable conclusion because OP literally had to ignore him introducing a gf to keep the misconception. OP is the one who implied his son wouldn't use the term gf casually as well. \n\nBy that same logic, there is no reason to assume Tanner is gay if he never says he is. There's equal possibility of gay and bi. It's a common assumption you have to be gay or straight, but the reality is sexuality is fluid for many people and you should actually never define someone without being explicitly told. \n\nPeople who identify as bi often face issues in lgbtq+ communities for the same reason of some people will not accept they are capable of a heterosexual sexual relationship and accuse them of being closeted. It's a sore subject for many, which is likely why Tanner reacted strongly- he should not have to be made to justify a heterosexual relationship because of previous homosexual relationships, and vice versa. Some people find it exhausting, and brothers reactions kinda indicate OP's son is already dealing with it.\n\nNot to mention the whole discussing the ex in front of the current partner, which is just awkward for everyone, especially if the relationship is new and Tanner hasn't gotten into his previous relationships with his current gf.", "> Where does it say his son is bi? He\u2019s only dated the same sex and only talked about the same sex.\n\nThe same place it says he's gay.  I.e. nowhere, OP just made assumptions.", "....\n\nIt's literally the post. Furthermore, not every gay man uses the \"stereotypical\" language, and OP confirmed that includes his son. Both you and OP jumped to huge stereotypes to ignore the OP's son introduced Natasha as a romantic partner because obviously he couldn't be bi and must have been using outdated slang that he doesn't actually use normally.\n\nIt's a textbook example of bi-erasure and completely exhausting for people who identify as bi.", "I mean ahead of time. The son doesn't live at home (OP thought he had moved in with his ex-bf already) so to just show up for dinner with an extra person and no warning is really odd to me. OP was under the impression that he was still with his ex and that they would be moving in together. I can see how he would skim past the \"girlfriend\" comment because he thought he was in a serious relationship with someone else. There was only 1 indication and it was the girlfriend comment. There was no other convo, hint or anything to clue OP in. What repeated indications are you talking about?", "Based on Tanner's history that OP saw, it does make more sense. Whether we like it or not, it's unavoidable to make judgments and assumptions about other ppl. It's human nature to look at someone's behavior and have your mind supply a reasoning behind it. Oh, that person is wearing scrubs, so they probably work in the medical field. Oh, that person always chooses the meat-free option whenever we go out for lunch, so they're probably a vegetarian. Oh, my son has only dayed men for years, so he's probably gay. \n\nShould we make an effort to be conscious of our assumptions and recognize that they could be wrong? Absolutely. But most assumptions like that are going to be harmless, especially if we acknowledge when we're wrong and make an effort to respect the new information we learn about someone.", "> It's a problem because of bi-erasure. That he could be bi is a reasonable conclusion because OP literally had to ignore him introducing a gf to keep the misconception. OP is the one who implied his son wouldn't use the term gf casually as well.\n\n**You are waxing eloquent about bi erasure on the wrong forum.**\n\nThis is not that. I\u2019m sorry but it isn\u2019t. No, people shouldn\u2019t assume a guy is gay just because he has only dated guys.\n\n**But it is very clear that OP NEITHER informed his dad that he had broken up with his previous ex, whom his dad thought he was going to MOVE IN WITH, nor that he was dating someone else, prior to bringing someone home.**\n\nAnd the term \u201cgirlfriend\u201d is absolutely used in contexts outside of dating. And it\u2019s still a logical conclusion to assume the he just picked up the phrase at school  when, as far as OP knows, he\u2019s *still dating a guy.*\n\n> By that same logic, there is no reason to assume Tanner is gay if he never says he is. There's equal possibility of gay and bi. It's a common assumption you have to be gay or straight, but the reality is sexuality is fluid for many people and you should actually never define someone without being explicitly told.\n\nWe all understand that, or we should. But that\u2019s not the issue at hand in OP\u2019s post. \n\n> People who identify as bi often face issues in lgbtq+ communities for the same reason of some people will not accept they are capable of a heterosexual sexual relationship and accuse them of being closeted. \n\nMost of us are aware. This is not that. \n\n> It's a sore subject for many, which is likely why Tanner reacted strongly\n\nAgreed \n\n> - he should not have to be made to justify a heterosexual relationship because of previous homosexual relationships, and vice versa. \n\nNo one asked him to justify it. They just misunderstood him.\n\n> Some people find it exhausting, and brothers reactions kinda indicate OP's son is already dealing with it.\n\nSure. But if he anticipated this, the least he could have done is give OP a heads up that they were bringing a PARTNER. And not the one OP clearly is under the impression they\u2019re with. \n\nI get that he shouldn\u2019t have to explain it, and that\u2019s honestly probably why he didn\u2019t say something beforehand, but it also isn\u2019t fair to his GIRLFRIEND to being her into a situation like that where their parents was totally not in the loop.\n\n> Not to mention the whole discussing the ex in front of the current partner, which is just awkward for everyone, especially if the relationship is new and Tanner hasn't gotten into his previous relationships with his current gf.\n\nWhich in my opinion was absolutely the son\u2019s fault, because he\u2019s the one who brought her and announced when they arrived that it was his girlfriend, knowing full well there was a chance would be a bit blindsided (rightly or wrongly is honestly irrelevant - in this case, it\u2019s family). And *especially* if he hasn\u2019t \u201cgotten into previous relationships\u201d with her. \n\n**Because - again - OP of course would NOT have brought up the ex if they were aware that they WERE the \u201cex.\u201d**\n\nMy take on this whole thing is that it was an honest mistake on OP\u2019s part, and either immaturely deliberate lack of communication, or just a general lack of foresight, on the son\u2019s part. \n\nNo one is genuinely an asshole here, but son definitely overreacted given the situation, in my opinion. As young adults often do. A little grace and understanding for family who you *know* are not behaving maliciously goes a long way.", "The only problem I see here is your Is virtue signaling. The dad can't know anything his son doesn't tell him. Since his son had only exclusively dated men, he made the reasonable mistake thinking that his son was gay. Once he found out his son is bi, he obviously has no problem with it. This was an honest mistake from an obviously accepting and loving person. Stop trying to make it out to be something it's not", "Figuring that someone who only has dated people from one sex is attracted to thay group is just rational thinking. \n\nGranted OP was a bit dense but you are literally trying to discourage people from thinking correctly", "Bi erasure is a really crappy thing. I'm a straight woman, there have been a couple women over the years I have found attractive, but for the most part I am really not at all interested in women. It fascinates me that bi people get treated so poorly by both camps in a weird \"pick a side\" way. I haven't chosen to prefer men, and as far as I can tell, gay men don't choose to like men, and lesbians don't choose to like women, we just like who we like. I find it so weird how bisexuals are suddenly considered wishy washy choosers instead of just genuinely attracted to both.\n\nThat said, if you have only known someone to date one or the other, and they've never really even expressed any interest in the other, right or wrong you might just assume they are gay or straight. OP was dense here, but we don't know how Tanner was interacting with his gf. May have been projecting friend vibes, too. He'd clearly never mentioned her, which is kinda odd. I'd mention if I was being someone to my parents house, personally, especially if it was a romantic partner that may not be expected. OP made a wrong assumption, but not out of malice or bi erasure, just ignorance of the full situation. \n\nHow it's handled from here on out is the biggest thing.", "The first line literally says he\u2019s gay.

Obviously OP didn\u2019t even know that son and his previous partner had broken up, so it\u2019s fair for him to think regardless of being gay or bi that she would be a girl friend. Son has also literally never before expressed to OP his interest in girls. The son didn\u2019t give OP enough information to be fair for him to realize this. He can\u2019t be mad at OP for not knowing he was bi when he literally never told OP he was. I think they\u2019re a bit oblivious, but not an ah. I think there\u2019s NAH. Everyone assumed things that shouldn\u2019t have been assumed.", "what stereotype did I jump to? That if a person is in a homosexual relationship with another person of the same sex and only has sexual relations with people of the same sex that makes them gay? Is that a bad stereotype to have? Should I just assume every person who has sex with someone of the same sex is bi? Isn\u2019t that the thing gay people have been fighting against for decades? That it\u2019s not just a phase or they will grow out of it.", "If OP breezed right past multiple explicit comments in the middle of dinner and only realized the truth when his other kids started actively laughing at him, why should we assume he didn't do the same thing with comments given to him ahead of time?\n\nLike I'm not assuming he WAS given a heads up either. I'm just saying that it seems incredibly generous of you to look at a man who expressly states that he just didn't notice multiple explicit statements because he assumed he already knew the truth and never bothered to ask any clarifying questions until far too late wouldn't have done the exact same thing before hand too.\n\nI think we have plenty of reason to believe that this is a kid who either A) does tell his dad things and knows he'll miss/ignore/forget them or B) DOESN'T tell his dad things BECAUSE he knows he'll miss/ignore/forget them. In either case, I don't think that's unreasonable of Tanner and IS rather a bed of Dad's own making. I hardly think it makes him a monster! But I don't think it makes Tanner one either.", "If someone brings home a girl and introduces her as a girlfriend, you had better damn well not bring up the ex unless you are absolutely positive they don't mean in a romantic sense. There might be a reason OP's son does not discuss relationships with his father or, worse, he had said something about the break up and dad straight forgot.\n\nIt is bi-erasure because OP literally had to create loopholes for language his son doesn't typically use to create the narrative she wasn't his gf.

Hurt feelings were inevitable.", "I think the \"apparent ex\" is OP's conclusion now in hindsight, not at the time, given the second half of the sentence saying that he didn't realize they had broken up.", ">not realizing yet they clearly broke up. \n\nMeaning he didn't know Corbin was an ex. \n\nOP thought his son was still dating Corbin and the girl he brought home was not a romantic partner, but a friend.", "The son hadn\u2019t told OP that they\u2019d broken up. OP didn\u2019t realize bc the son hadn\u2019t told him. Are you expecting OP to read minds?", "Work on your reading comprehension.", "Yeah I\u2019m surprised at all of the people calling OP TA for assuming the son was gay. The son has ever only dated boys and only talked about boys? I feel like that\u2019s a completely natural conclusion.", "I feel like you\u2019re really thinking too hard on this. People don\u2019t have black and white relationships, especially with their parents. The son is 19. He\u2019s away at school. Maybe he doesn\u2019t feel like keeping his parents informed and him going from one relationship to another wasn\u2019t a big event in his mind. It\u2019s easy to look back in hindsight and say why didn\u2019t you do this, this, and this.", "Girlfriend is unfortunately ambiguous. It can mean romantic partner or it can mean friend that's a girl. I know many people who use it in the second sense. Perhaps partner would have been less ambiguous.", "You know like is she *a* girlfriend or *your* girlfriend? The former implies a friend that's a girl; the latter implies a romantic partner.", "It\u2019s an easy mistake for the father to have made.", "I remember reading that the tendency of straight women referring to their platonic female friends as 'girlfriend' provides a significant challenge to gay/bi women who have to take extra steps to introduce someone as their partner and not just as a platonic friend.  It didn't occur to me that this could potentially affect bi men as well.", "Especially if the last piece of info you have is that said person was planning on moving in with their boyfriend. In that case \u2018they meant girlfriend in a platonic way\u2019 seems like less of a leap than \u2018they broke up with their boyfriend and meant girlfriend in a romantic sense\u2019 even if you know the person is bisexual.", "If everyone else understood the father should\u2019ve if he knew is son", "No, he says multiple times he thought his son was gay and is moving in with his bf Corbin.   \n  \nAgain, it's 2 paragraphs - read them slower and then come back with another excuse since youve had to change your first two.", "Okay, so OPs goal was to out his son cheating on Corbin with this new girl - and possibly make sure she knew he's banged dudes in the past.  \n  \nI suppose exposing cheaters isn't straight AH behavior. I'll stick with him being an AH though.", "No, I'm expecting him not to ask infront of his new partner what happened to his old partner.", "Dude outted his son to his new partner.  \n  \nWork on your compassion.", "Regardless of dating status or sexuality it's weird and bordering on rude to show up to your parents house for dinner with a +1 and not warn them. What if they didn't make enough food for an extra person? My parents would have been annoyed with me if I did that and probably chided me to ask them next time, or at least give them a heads up.", "That logic works if they ran into each other at the grocery store or a restaurant or something. But that logic kinda falls apart here imo. Tanner took his new girlfriend to his parents house. Even if you are low contact with your family that seems like the time to make the clarifying text of \u2018btw I broke up with Corbin a while back and am seeing someone new and i\u2019m bringing them when I come over later\u2019. If OP had still assumed the person introduced as his girlfriend was a platonic friend then I would agree he is an ass. \n\nBut as a bisexual man who is low contact with my parents, who do know I\u2019m bisexual by the way, there is a certain amount of you can only be so mad at them for not knowing information you kept from them\u2026\n\nThis honestly just sounds like a sheer lack of communication on all sides leading to a big foot in mouth situation.", "I mean what is Dad supposed to do? Not believe his son is gay despite him only ever talking about boy crushes and only dating guys since middle school? That would make Dad an un-supportive AH who thinks this is all just a phase. \n\nIt doesn't sound like he's ever had an issue with who his son dates, he just didn't immediately realize it was this girl because it's not who his son usually dates and wasn't the specific person *he still thought his son was dating.*", "Except he was put in a position where in the moment he had to assume something. Either he assumes Corbin and Tanner are still together and Natasha is a platonic friend, Corbin and Tanner are still together and in an open relationship with Natasha, Tanner and Corbin are still together and Tanner is boldly also cheating on Corbin and introducing his affair partner to his family, Corbin and Tanner broke up and Natasha is a platonic friend, or Tanner and Corbin broke up and Tanner is now dating Natasha. Now I admit that at least one of those is pretty unlikely, but those are the options that I see. \n\nI will concede that it would have been best for OP to get clarity after Natasha had left instead of asking about Corbin while she was there - but I\u2019m still not sure I want to call him an asshole for coming to a reasonable conclusion based on the information he had in the moment. Which to recap was: Tanner is dating Corbin. Tanner introduced Natasha as his girlfriend. It\u2019s not uncommon for platonic friends who are girls to be described as girlfriends. \n\nAnd honestly the \u2018op shouldn\u2019t assume Tanner is gay\u2019 cuts multiple ways. He also shouldn\u2019t assume that he broke up with Corbin. The son was expecting him to assume something and OP got it wrong.", "lesbian here! he didn't assume anything he just did his best to support his son and misunderstood the situation. he's not homophobic for this when he only brought home men\u2014the son never explicitly came out as anything and the dad was just doing his best to understand his son but misunderstood the situation. it wasn't anything malicious or him refusing to see his son. he was just using the info he had. focus on actually homophobic people. NTA OP.", "Exactly, and he seems to be sorry about the misunderstanding. So i dont think he did anything wrong.", "I'm literally a different person but go off.", "No. OP thought the girl was a friend, not a romantic partner. \"Girlfriend\" is ambiguous that way. He didn't think his son was cheating. He didn't think he was outing anyone. He just thought he was asking his kid about his relationship in front of a friend.", "But he didn\u2019t know the old partner was an old partner? He thought Corbin was a current partner and Natasha was a friend.", "I agree, and my parents would feel the same. I\u2019m just saying that there doesn\u2019t need to be a deep reason for why he forgot to update his parents on his dating status. He\u2019s a kid.", "I was just giving examples of what could have happened, clearly there\u2019s a lack of communication. I don\u2019t even think OP was the AH, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s that deep if the son forgot to keep the parents up to date on his dating status. It\u2019s his own fault what happened, but I don\u2019t find it unusual.", "Better an understanding father than a oblivious one. He doesn\u2019t need to be painted as an asshole, he already feels bad about saying the wrong thing and upsetting the relationship with his kid. Everyone take a breather.", "Why would I care to read your name? You jumped in my conversation, not the other way around.", "He said he didn't know.  \n  \nHe then said he outted his kid since he didn't know.  \n  \nHe outted his kid to figure it out, he could of just not asked about the boy he thought his son was banging and moving in with in the person that was just introduced as his girlfriend.  \n  \nMaybe OP is just an idiot, that doesn't make him not an AH.", "No, he said didn't understand why his son referred to her as his GF and made an assumption.  \n  \nHe then outted his son.", "I'm not the one who brought up the deep reasons lol that was Thelmara. I'm just saying that if the son had the same reasons as Thelmara, it's even more odd to bring a new partner home.", "That\u2019s fair. And I do absolutely get not telling your parents everything right away - even when you do have a good relationship with your parents!", "BEcause he was only into guys, only dated guys and only crushed on guys.  Call me crazy but that usually indicates someone is into guys.", "Ah yes, your super private conversation on a public forum.", "So you don't understand the difference between \"into guys\" and \"gay\", apparently.\n\nBoth bi men and gay men are into guys.", "Ugh, I wish I had an award for you!!! Great breakdown,", "It's such a difficult position to be in. I'm bi and a woman, and I've not been in a relationship with a woman. So many people, even friends of mine, have made jokes about me being straight and erased that side of me. And that hurt because they _knew_ I was bi.\n\nI agree with you here, the key difference is the knowing.\n\nOP says as far as they knew their son was gay, they thought he was still with his old partner and hadn't made the mental distinction of girl friend and girlfriend. But this doesn't make it bi-erasure. It sounds like the son never sat OP down and outright declared their sexuality, nor discussed anything that would have explained having a girlfriend and (in OP's mind) a boyfriend at the same time. There isn't anything in OP's experience with their son, at least that they've said to us, that is indicative of prior knowledge, awareness or experience of their son being bi. \n\nOP hasn't then turned around and said his son's relationships with men didn't count, and hasn't dismissed the girlfriend as some sort of beard. OP isn't erasing their son's identity, they are learning about it. This is new for them.\n\nAn allegory of sorts: If all the swans I had ever seen in the world in my lifetime up until now were white, I'd assume the next swan I see would also be white. I can't guarantee it would be, it could be green or purple or orange with polka dots, but I would feel very confident in assuming the next swan I saw would be white. No one has ever mentioned swans coming in other colours to me.\n\nMy limited experience of swan colours does limit my ability to predict what colour the next swan will be, but I don't know this, as I have only seen white swans.  For me to predict a purple swan when I'm only seeing white feathers everywhere would be so far out of left field that it doesn't make sense.\n\nAnd because I've only seen white swans, I don't immediately recognise the purple bird in front of me as a swan. I assumed all swans I saw would be white.\n\nAm I wrong for that assumption? Probably.\n\nIs that assumption still logical and understandable? Definitely.\n\nCan I be surprised at the existence of purple swans? Sure\n\nBut the important part is what happens with that surprise. \n\nDo I pretend purple swans don't exist now I've seen one? That this purple bird isn't a swan, but some other thing? Or think that all those white birds weren't swans in the first place, and that only this purple bird is a swan?\n\nNo, because that's the erasure - that's burying someone's identity.\n\nOr, do I take a moment to reconsider what colours swans could come in? And do I acknowledge that past history isn't always the best predictor for future actions, so I should be mindful about birds in other colours? Yes. \n\nAm I irredeemable for thinking swans came in white? No, you can be redeemed, because everyone has assumed that a bird only comes in one colour. Some might have thought pigeons were only ever grey, or all ducks had green heads.\n\nEvery single person has at some point made an assumption on a person's sexuality, and to pretend otherwise is lying to yourself. Whether it's assuming straight as the default, gay as the default, lesbian, asexual, pansexual and any other colour on the spectrum, an assumption has been made, based on a turn of phrase, tone of voice, haircut, fashion sense, whatever else. But it's what you do after realising that your assumption was wrong that matters.\n\nOP tried to apologise to their son, they tried to explain why they'd come to that conclusion in order to show it was a mistake and not malicious. OP isn't ignoring their son's identity, they were just ignorant of it.\n\nETA: [spelling]", "Who said it was private?  \n   \nIf you want to respond to something I said it's a bit weird to expect me not to respond to your response.  \n \nWhat's your name matter?", "I think that misunderstandings are very easy to dissect in hindsight, or when laid out before us. That said, it\u2019s really not as simple in the moment. To me it sounds like OP was genuinely confused and possibly feeling awkward about the whole situation. in his confusion missed what may or may not have been clearly communicated. I\u2019m guessing not because they both clearly have some significant communication issues. He definitely is NTA for making a mistake, especially since he did try to discuss it after the sons reaction."]}
