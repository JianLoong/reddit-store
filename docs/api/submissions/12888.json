I always explain that we close in less than fifteen minutes but they always insist they'll eat quickly or some other bs excuse. Sometimes they're able to eat really quickly and be out before I lock the doors at 8:58 and sometimes they watch me lock the doors and go right back to their conversations.

I'm the one who has to clean the lobby every night I work. I'm not willing to delay my close by however long they choose to sit and carry on their conversations after we close. Right at 9, the very first second I can, I immediately take all my dishes back into the dishroom and start my after close stuff. Think sweeping, mopping, wiping down tables I couldn't get to before, sometimes cleaning a window or two. But because my dishes include parts of the Freestyle machine, customers who stay late often get sprayed with food colouring that can (and has!) stained clothes. Now, I have plenty of other things I could do before taking my dishes back but I feel that those who purposefully stay after we close deserve it and the dish person needs to close too. Some of my coworkers think it's funny and like to watch people get sprayed, but others say I'm an ass and I should be a bit nicer or at least warn customers.

I think this is pretty common.  I've lost track of time in restaurants before and didn't really notice until the staff started cleaning, and I apologized profusely. \n\nExpecting the staff to sit around and wait while you take your sweet time eating right before closing  is a very AH thing to do.", "NTA. People are inconsiderate af", "NTA\n\nIf you're closed, then you're closed, and closing activities will be taking place! Customers are easily able to escape this situation by leaving before closing time. I typically would give customers one warning that I'm going to be cleaning and spraying chemicals, and if they don't want to move or leave then that's their problem.", "NTA but you can finesse this. Warn them that the dining room will be closing for cleaning starting at 9 and that it gets messy. Then ask would you like this to go or do you want to start out here and then take it to go at 9 when we close the dining room? Then at 8:58 walk by and give them a heads up that you'll be by in a minute to escort them through the locked door. Keep it cheerful, friendly and firm and you'll be good 90% of the time. The soda machine will take care of the rest.", "NTA. And I hope everyone in the food service industry agrees.", "NTA. They're inconsiderate entitled lieces of shit. Don't come at close and expect the place not to close. Service workers have a life too and you don't owe it to other people to make exceptions just because they're paying the same as every other customer. Hospo workers spend loooong hours on their feet for below minimum wage and no break and have to deal with people's shit with a smile. I hated the customers who'd come in 15min before closing and expect as to reopen everything and keep everything open for as long as they wanted. No I'm not going to flush out all the chemical I've just stuck into the coffee machine and use the grinder after brushing it out so you can have one half-strength decaf soy vanilla flat white get fuxked and go to Starbucks.", "I\u2019ve been in the food service industry for years and I always love a good \u2018entitled customer fucks around and finds out\u2019 scenario. Well done,but really you SHOULD give a warning first to avoid a lawsuit. Beyond that,a \u2018no eating in after 8:30pm\u2019 sign might be a good thing too.", "Nta They are rude and entitled.", "No need to coddle and keep giving customers a heads up. You can make it a policy not to take orders beyond 8.45 and put a sign up. No need to justify or get into conversations about it.", "NTA at 855 tell them they need to leave because you close at 9. End of discussion. There is no reason for customers to still be there after 9.", "NTA but you sure as shit can see some folks in this thread who are!\n\nDon't do this to restaurant workers. It is fucking rude. People want to go home.", "[removed]", "YTA- this is a great way to get shitty reviews and lose business. You are knowingly damaging customers clothes without warning them. \n\nThose late night customers aren\u2019t *just* late night customers. And if your business tanks all those employees are out of a job. \n\nWhy not just close down tables and herd customers to one small section? Then keep working around then away from the sprayer. That\u2019s what my local joint does.", "YTA\n\nBut in a good way.", "I think it's standard practice for a business to be open during their open times. If you want to be *out* by 9 just change your closing time to 8:30 and you won't keep having this issue. I don't think you're an asshole but it's very nonstandard and you're probably in the wrong here? When I worked in food service I hated when customers came in late too--but we were open until then.", "YTA, that kind of place should expect to have people there until 30 minutes after close! You're just being a jerk, it's not like those people are posted up for hours after they've ordered and eaten! I really hope someone reports you, this isn't the normal asshole customer sticking around, it's a fast casual restaurant that they bought food from minutes before!", "YTA\n\nSorry, but yeah. If your restaurant/restaurant\u2019s lobby closes at 9pm and customers come in at 845pm, the customer should be entitled to enjoy their meal, even if doing so goes beyond closing time. Obviously, within reason. For example, I don\u2019t think customers should be abusive or just simply hanging out. You do, after all, have a job to do and a home to get to (and are probably under pressure from higher management to keep your payroll costs down).\n\nEdited to add: and taking petty revenge on those who do stay is not the answer to your problems. You could, instead, politely remind the customers that you\u2019re closed and to please exit the building. If your unable or unwilling to do that, involve a manager.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
