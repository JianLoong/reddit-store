{"id": 9134, "submission_id": "10tkhvq", "title": "AITA For Telling My Boyfriend To Use My Roommate\u2019s Bathroom?", "selftext": "I (19F) just moved into an apartment with two other girls, Kayla and Maya (both 21F). Two days ago, I had my boyfriend Liam (20M) over, and we were hanging out between classes. We lost track of time while talking and realized that if we didn\u2019t leave in the next couple of minutes that I\u2019d be late for my afternoon class. I rushed to the bathroom to pee, and a moment later my boyfriend knocked on the door and told me to hurry up because he had to go too. We really didn\u2019t have much time left and I still needed to brush my teeth and check my hair and makeup, and I wasn\u2019t going to do that with him pissing in the bathroom. My mind raced and the only thing I could think of was to tell Liam to use my roommate Kayla\u2019s bathroom, as her bedroom door is right across from mine and I know she doesn\u2019t lock her door.\n\nLiam went and used Kayla\u2019s bathroom, and five minutes later we were out the door. I barely made it to class on time, but I made it, so I relaxed and things went on as normal. However, when I got out of class, I had some missed texts from my roommate group chat. I opened it to see Kayla asking if anyone used her bathroom while she was at work. Maya had said no, that she\u2019d been gone since 9 and wouldn\u2019t be back until after a thing with her sorority sisters. I responded saying I didn\u2019t use it, thinking there was no way she really knew that someone had been in there while she was out. I put my phone away and headed to the food court to grab something for dinner, then went back home, only to find Kayla on the couch watching tv. I said hi and just headed straight for my room, but before I could get my door unlocked Kayla asked \u201cWhy was Liam in my bathroom?\u201d I asked her what she meant, and she told me she found ashes in the sink and a cigarette butt in the trash. Liam is the only one of use or our partners that actively smokes cigarettes. \n\nI figured at that point I was caught and admitted that I told him to use her bathroom when we were in a rush to leave. She told me that\u2019s no excuse and reminded me that not only did we \u201cviolate her privacy\u201d but that Maya and her have already asked that Liam not smoke inside the apartment. None of them like the smell of cigarettes and Kayla especially dislikes them because she grew up with a chain smoking father. I tried to apologize again and asked why it was such a big deal, because she never locks her door so what exactly does she expect? She told me she shouldn\u2019t have to tell me as an adult to not go into her bedroom without permission, then got up and went into her room, slamming it and locking the door. I called Liam upset about it and told him what happened and he said Kayla was overreacting. I think so too, but she hasn\u2019t spoken to me since and has been ignoring me. Maya has talked to me noticeably less as well. I\u2019m wondering if I messed up here or if they\u2019re just overreacting for real.\n\nEDIT- For clarification since everyone focusing on the smoking thing, the apartment is not smoke free. The entire apartment complex is smoke friendly. Maya and Kayla have no problem with Liam smoking on the patio or outside and disposing his cigarettes in my trash or the kitchen trash, but it\u2019s in the 30s outside so I let him smoke in my bedroom because he shouldn\u2019t have to be freezing cold while he smokes. It\u2019s in my room so it\u2019s nbd. And Kayla has let me use her bathroom once before so of course I didn\u2019t think letting Liam do it would blow up like this. Also we have individual leases so they can\u2019t \u201ckick me off the lease.\u201d They can\u2019t kick me out for letting Liam smoke.", "created_utc": 1675528219, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tkhvq/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_to_use_my_roommates/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The lying also proves that you definitely knew what you did was wrong and that she would in fact mind him using her bathroom. \n\nWhile they can\u2019t forbid you from allowing him to smoke in your room it is still pretty rude to let him.

It also gives a very good excuse to throw out that *one* bratty roommate that doesn\u2019t seem to grasp the reality of the world. \n\nThe world isn\u2019t made of unicorns and cotton candy. \n\nYTA", "YTA. I hope your roommates move out and you get screwed over.

So many times over.\n\nThe apartment may not be \u201csmoke-free\u201d but anyone who smokes indoors with others who are non-smokers are assholes. Apart from the stink that will never come out, do you not get the health hazard? \n\nYes your bf should either not smoke, smoke in his own house, or smoke outside - I dont care how cold it is, put on a ski jacket. He should certainly not smoke in SOMEONE ELSE\u2019s room/bathroom. \n\nHow can you not get basic privacy rights? Do not enter other people\u2019s private spaces without permission! Your roommate didnt lock her door probably because she didnt realise this was something you did not understand. \n\nAnd if for some reason you needed to enter someone else\u2019s private space - ask for permission first. If it was an emergency, at least let them know/own up to it. She even gave you a chance to own up and say - \u201csorry Liam had to urgently use a toilet and I was on mine\u201d and you lied.", "YTA \n\nYou prioritized your vanity over your roommates privacy and then tried to occult the whole situation on a technicality that \"YOU\" didn't use the bathroom. \n\nManage your time better and learn some respect for other people's space.", "YTA. You two invaded someone's private place, behaved disrespectfully while doing it and you lied about it and get offended by negative reaction to your wrong doing. You should be apologizing. How are you not an asshole?", "Absolutely hilarious to see you try to spin this into Kayla being the real problem. Like did you seriously expect any human on the planet to tell you that Kayla is the asshole and that you and Liam are just victims here?", "YTA. Obviously, for all the reasons others are mentioning here, but also... you were *so late* and still insisted on doing hair and makeup? When your bf needed to use the bathroom? Why?", "YTA.

Disgusting", "You\u2019re so cringe and really selfish. You sound like the actual worst. YTA", "YTA and FYI your roommates are already rethinking this arrangement.  You should try to shape up.  Either way, good luck", "You allowed your bf to use your roommate's personal space without permission, you allowed him to smoke inside after agreeing that it wasn't okay, and you lied about it to your roomates.

Then later he put a broken camera in my room (think security camera style with the cord cut). I was thoroughly creeped out and changed my doorknob so that it locked and never left it unlocked again. I told my roommate what happened and she apologized and our relationship was fine.\n\nJust apologize", "I agree YTA. Kayla probably left her door unlocked because she thought she could trust that her adult roommates had boundaries.

I would honestly be irate and forbid him from ever coming over again,", "Its not just about the cig, its about the fact that the bathroom your roommate expects exclusive use of and cleans themselves was used by someone else, that is super nasty and invasive. I wouldn\u2019t want to have to clean my personal toilet knowing someone else shit or pissed in it, it\u2019s a nasty enough job already. \n\nAlso as a woman I would possibly have private items in my room or washroom like bra, etc. that I would expect privacy for not having others see without them being an expected guest and having a chance to clean up my space. \n\nYou encouraged your guest to invade your roommates privacy, and now are saying \u201cthey didn\u2019t lock up so they basically asked for it\u201d does that sound like anything else to you?\n\nYTA", "\u2026you very clearly stated that she\u2019s asked that no one smokes in the apartment because it bothers her and you\u2019re maintaining that him smoking in the apartment is no big deal.
