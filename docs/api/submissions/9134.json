{"id": 9134, "submission_id": "10tkhvq", "title": "AITA For Telling My Boyfriend To Use My Roommate\u2019s Bathroom?", "selftext": "I (19F) just moved into an apartment with two other girls, Kayla and Maya (both 21F). Two days ago, I had my boyfriend Liam (20M) over, and we were hanging out between classes. We lost track of time while talking and realized that if we didn\u2019t leave in the next couple of minutes that I\u2019d be late for my afternoon class. I rushed to the bathroom to pee, and a moment later my boyfriend knocked on the door and told me to hurry up because he had to go too. We really didn\u2019t have much time left and I still needed to brush my teeth and check my hair and makeup, and I wasn\u2019t going to do that with him pissing in the bathroom. My mind raced and the only thing I could think of was to tell Liam to use my roommate Kayla\u2019s bathroom, as her bedroom door is right across from mine and I know she doesn\u2019t lock her door.\n\nLiam went and used Kayla\u2019s bathroom, and five minutes later we were out the door. I barely made it to class on time, but I made it, so I relaxed and things went on as normal. However, when I got out of class, I had some missed texts from my roommate group chat. I opened it to see Kayla asking if anyone used her bathroom while she was at work. Maya had said no, that she\u2019d been gone since 9 and wouldn\u2019t be back until after a thing with her sorority sisters. I responded saying I didn\u2019t use it, thinking there was no way she really knew that someone had been in there while she was out. I put my phone away and headed to the food court to grab something for dinner, then went back home, only to find Kayla on the couch watching tv. I said hi and just headed straight for my room, but before I could get my door unlocked Kayla asked \u201cWhy was Liam in my bathroom?\u201d I asked her what she meant, and she told me she found ashes in the sink and a cigarette butt in the trash. Liam is the only one of use or our partners that actively smokes cigarettes. \n\nI figured at that point I was caught and admitted that I told him to use her bathroom when we were in a rush to leave. She told me that\u2019s no excuse and reminded me that not only did we \u201cviolate her privacy\u201d but that Maya and her have already asked that Liam not smoke inside the apartment. None of them like the smell of cigarettes and Kayla especially dislikes them because she grew up with a chain smoking father. I tried to apologize again and asked why it was such a big deal, because she never locks her door so what exactly does she expect? She told me she shouldn\u2019t have to tell me as an adult to not go into her bedroom without permission, then got up and went into her room, slamming it and locking the door. I called Liam upset about it and told him what happened and he said Kayla was overreacting. I think so too, but she hasn\u2019t spoken to me since and has been ignoring me. Maya has talked to me noticeably less as well. I\u2019m wondering if I messed up here or if they\u2019re just overreacting for real.\n\nEDIT- For clarification since everyone focusing on the smoking thing, the apartment is not smoke free. The entire apartment complex is smoke friendly. Maya and Kayla have no problem with Liam smoking on the patio or outside and disposing his cigarettes in my trash or the kitchen trash, but it\u2019s in the 30s outside so I let him smoke in my bedroom because he shouldn\u2019t have to be freezing cold while he smokes. It\u2019s in my room so it\u2019s nbd. And Kayla has let me use her bathroom once before so of course I didn\u2019t think letting Liam do it would blow up like this. Also we have individual leases so they can\u2019t \u201ckick me off the lease.\u201d They can\u2019t kick me out for letting Liam smoke.\n\nEDIT 2\u2013 OKAY!! I REALIZE I WAS THE ASSHOLE!! I wasn\u2019t trying to argue in the comments I was just clarifying things. I\u2019m going to try and apologize to Kayla again. I just want to get past this.", "created_utc": 1675528219, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tkhvq/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_to_use_my_roommates/", "score": 545, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
