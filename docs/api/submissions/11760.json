{"id": 11760, "submission_id": "11lesro", "title": "AITA for asking my coworker to share the stuff I buy for the office?", "selftext": " \n\nEvery Monday I go grocery shopping on my lunch break to get stuff for lunches for the whole week. I like to make myself lunch at work to avoid the temptation of fast food and I like my desk snacks. Every week, I stop by the \"day-old\" bakery shelf to bring something for the office to share. The grocery store has an excellent bakery and their day-olds are still very fresh, but half price. I bring my groceries back to my office and leave the bakery items and a bunch of bananas out in the common area for the intention of opening them up in the morning for breakfast with the team. I have been doing this for several years. The office will maybe have between 3 and 5 people in on Tuesdays. Sometimes people get into the baked goods a little early, but everyone knows the intention of the bakery stuff for breakfast on Tuesday.\n\nOne of my coworkers is notorious for gobbling up shared office treats, weather they are gifts from clients (gift baskets, cookies, candy, etc.) or if we are having lunch brought in, he is first in line, maybe even his second go-round by the time you are ready to eat. Yesterday put out a cinnamon pudding ring (like a very moist cake) and said coworker (we'll call him Snacky) asked me if I would like him to wait until the morning to get into it. Of course I said yes, I would like to wait to share with coffee.\n\nThis morning I come in and get myself a piece of pudding cake and enjoy it with my coffee. There is one other coworker in the office, but she doesn't want any cake. Snacky comes in and immediately gets himself a piece that's a third of the cake, grabs coffee and heads to the back. I grumble to myself about it, but I don't say anything.\n\nAn hour later, another huge piece is missing. I go to lunch, and now there is one small piece of cake left. I ask the other coworker about it and she hadn't had any all day. I have never said anything but today I finally had it. I texted Snacky a picture of the sliver of cake and told him that he ate nearly the whole thing. He offered to pay me for it, but I told him that's not the point. He then tells me that maybe I shouldn't be leaving things out to share if I don't want to share, and that I shouldn't have asked anyone else if they ate the cake because it made him look like a pig.\n\nI actually got pretty mad about that comment. Am I supposed to change my behavior? I straight up told him that I am going to continue to leave stuff out, but he needs to be f\\*cking considerate. He responded, \"ok.\"\n\nAITA for confronting him about something I'm sharing with him anyway?", "created_utc": 1678230734, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11lesro/aita_for_asking_my_coworker_to_share_the_stuff_i/", "score": 114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes the food was for everyone, but it is considerate to eat a reasonable amount.", "NTA. But maybe stop buying the food to share for a short time.

I think most people with home training would know to take a small piece and leave some for others... but the thing is, it's really not your place to teach your coworker manners like he's four years old and you're his mother.\n\nSo even though he's being an AH about this, if you set out food for your coworkers to eat... that ends your ownership and control over said food. If Snacky eats it all, it is what it is. You can always stop bringing stuff in if it bothers you.", "NTA. This sounds like a co-irker I once had, 'John'.

You're not just buying stuff for him. \n\n>I shouldn't have asked anyone else if they ate the cake because it made him look like a pig.\n\nLol, he looks like a pig because he is a pig. Stop eating the whole bloody cake by yourself (and no leaving a sliver is not sharing) if you don't want to be treated like someone who ate a whole cake meant to be shared.\n\nMaybe send an email around the entire team, asking that they remember to only eat a share of any treats left in the lunch room. You're not calling him out directly, but...", "Cut up and/or portion out an equal portion for each employee. Put those portions in a Ziploc or cheap, reusable container (e.g., Cool Whip container). Add a little note with a smiley or something encouraging and place them in each cubicle/office/workspace. They can either eat it or take it home to someone else. \n\nOr, if that sounds like a pain, you can either A) not do it anymore or B) let Snacky's ravenousness be a teachable moment about control. If you give freely, then it is no longer yours. Let Snacky eat to his heart's content. Maybe watch to see if Snacky likes some choices better than others. Cheese danishes? Yum! Biscotti? It's a \"meh\" from Snacky. (But the lady at the end of the row loved them.) You might even watch a small drama play out between the staff as they try to negotiate the \"Snacky thing.\" Generosity has its way of creating surprising little ripples we never intended and can't control. I usually start thinking about great apes around this point. \ud83d\ude05", "NTA. Im a hobby baker and i bring things into work every now and then. Common rules are that 1, you dont get into whatever it is unless the bringer first got some or said its okay for someone to go in and 2, you eat one NORMAL serving size and wait for others to get some, if they want, before going in for seconds. And even then you confirm if anybody who wanted some did get some. \n\nYou shouldn't have to do this and absolutely dont have to, but slight suggestion is to precut an appropriate serving size/per people who would eat. But again, suggestion. This is a grown adult who is knowingly getting way more than their fair share. This is stuff you expect from kids.", "I remember bringing in a big bag of cherry tomatoes that my garden had over-produced. I put a sign on the bag saying that I was sharing my bounty and for everyone to help themselves to some. \n\nI passed by maybe 30 mins later and the whole bag was missing. I walked around the office and found it sitting on someone's desk. They were taking the whole bag for themselves.  I took the bag back to the share table and made another sign saying to take a handful or two, and not try to steal the whole bag.  Assholes are everywhere. But OP is NTA here.", "ESH cut pieces for people", "You know, I never really put much thought into it because we are all adults here. This is maybe the second or third time he's creamed a whole cake himself before. There really hasn't been a problem until I said something today. Everyone takes a little bit and if there's some leftover the next day, that's great :) The whole intention is sharing. Snacky just takes a little more than what's fair.", "Omg this guy does that. Leftover pizza? Goes in the fridge in the back... Leftover BBQ? Back fridge", "I would hate to have to do that... (usually the bakery items are individual pastries and stuff anyway) and if I had to put out a sign, it would literally be for one person, so that seems a bit passive-agressive.", "I disagree.

OP shouldn't let one person ruin it.", "My other coworker used to bring in breakfast sandwiches on Fridays and stopped because he would grab more than one :(", "On top of buying the food, you want OP to cut it for them? Perhaps someone else could cut it but why ESH? The system worked for everyone except for Snacky so he should follow the norm", "You can word it nicely.

I would probably either stop bringing in food altogether if it bothered me that much, or just set the food out and be done with it after that.", "NTA but I believe Snacky won't stop this or will continue to cause conflict when/if called on, he could even bring this to HR and claim you are harassing him or something. Just stop bringing the food. It's nice but some people will take advantage of generosity.", "Lol what did you expect to happen when you bring foods to share with colleagues? Maybe you can post a list of rules next to the food so everyone knows protocol. Or maybe stop bringing food in altogether if it bothers you so much. Expecting an AH to confirm to your rules is pretty foolish.", "NTA but I'd take it to another level. I'd stop bringing any in. Then, a couple weeks later, bring in a container with just crumbs in the bottom and snacky's name in sharpie on the top, and leave that in the break room. Yes, I know I'm bad.", "Nta, but honestly I would stop bring things and when people start to question just point the finger, like sorry I loved bringing things to share but snacky just selfish and I don\u2019t feel comfortable bring things anymore", "I second this. I understand wanting to be nice but you shouldn\u2019t let them get too used to certain generous behaviors or else they take you for granted and you got a person like snacks who probably intentionally skipped breakfast cuz they know you\u2019ll cover it. \n\n\u201cI bring things when I am in a good mood and I want to.
