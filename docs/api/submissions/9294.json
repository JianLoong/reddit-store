Otherwise the kid is sleeping on the couch.", "No, don\u2019t go there.  Remember you were and have been helping her out.  That she expected you to give up your bed, signals that the expectations of your friendship have shifted.  She is now looking at your availability, dependability, and generosity as something she is entitled to.  Criticizing your sleeping in your own bed is the start of guilting you into feeling obligated and to viewing your availability as something you owe her.  She may not have had to work an overnight shift but may have had a date.  Sh would not have been able to  be away all night at all ever, if you weren\u2019t her neighbor.  Yet she is treating you like an employee who isn\u2019t dutiful enough.\n\nSo test it out.  Find out if you helping her and her child is all about her putting more and more if her \u201cpoor single mom\u201d situation at your doorstep instead of her own.  \n\nPull back from her.  Inform her that you can take her daughter in after school but will not take her in overnight or on weekends.  Don\u2019t explain; don\u2019t justify or argue.  Just say no.  She will be angry but just let her be and hold your position.\n\nHas she ever attempted to do you any favors?  This is important.  It is a weird quirk of human nature to be grateful for help initially but eventually feel entitled  to it.  If she understands she owes you, the relationship gets better and impositions fewer. \n\nDon\u2019t let her tell you that you aren\u2019t doing anything with your time so you should help her.

No, she tells you off for not prioritising *her* child in your home.\n\nI really think you should withdraw all this help you're happily providing: you're so happy about it that she's turning you into a co-parent and is now trying to whip you into line on how she wants this to go so she can easily dump her girl safely into a maximal situation whenever she needs to earn extra cash. All that earlier assistance has left her incredibly entitled. She no longer sees what you do as a favour, she thinks she's entitled to get you to do so much whenever she needs help.\n\nTell her that since what was available at your home was so unacceptable then it probably would be for the best if you withdrew such unacceptable assistance and you'll let her pick up her daughter from ..........

You are already giving up a not insignificant amount of time to look after her daughter, you shouldn't also be expected to give up a good night's sleep too.\n\nIt seems fair that the person imposing on you be the one that sleeps on the sofa - this is definitely where I have ended up every time I have stayed at a friends who didn't have a spare bed.\n\nAs an extra point, the child is also the one who will probably cope best in this situation too - for them a sofa is more likely to be a fun novelty, they will be smaller and more likely to fit, and their bodies will typically cope much better with a weirdly shaped and slightly uncomfortable bed for a night, unlike the groaning and stiff adult.", " Did she pay you for watching her daughter", "Not that she told me", "I\u2019m not going to imply that OP is a predator because we don\u2019t have any evidence whatsoever to validate that- this is about your comment. The world is always terrifying for women & queer people (of course not mutually exclusive groups).

This reminds me of that Margaret Atwood quote: \u201cMen are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them\u201d.
