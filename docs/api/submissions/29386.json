{"id": 29386, "submission_id": "17dd2xy", "title": "AITA for causing everyone to stop helping my SIL?", "selftext": "My(30) husband(34) has a sister we will call  M(33). M and her husband have 4 children. Both M and her husband are very loud and always angry and fighting over something so we don't talk to them much.\n\nRecently the children were removed from their care and placed in the care of my MIL. M has asked everyone in the family to help them. They need their home cleaned and several other things. So I went to their home to help. I had no idea how bad their home was, I haven't been there in years. They have a serious roach infestation. Not the big wood roaches that come in sometimes, I'm talking the little disgusting ones that get into everything and can't get rid of and will take home with you by accident. They also had wall to wall stacks of trash and just about everything imaginable on the floors/ counters. I couldn't even see floor in most places. So we cleaned and cleaned and my husband and FIL paid for a dumpster to be brought. It took us several days of cleaning to even see floors and we still have tons more to do. \n\n I am terrified of roaches. My dad used to hold me down when I was little and put them on my face when he was mad. So I wear gloves and coveralls and am trying to do my best not to panic. However I've been ridiculously paranoid since starting this. I can feel them crawling on me even when I know I'm clean fresh out the shower. I refuse to bring any of those roaches with me home. I strip to my underwear before even getting in my car and change into shorts and a tank top and shove everything I wore into a garbage bag to wash immediately when I get home. \n\nApparently M saw me strip and shove everything into the bag and got very upset. She asked me if I thought I was better than her and made it a huge issue. Honestly I just don't want roaches in my house at all. They are gross and terrifying and near impossible to get rid of. \n\nI tried to explain but she just got angrier so I just told her if this was her way of thanking me for my help I can leave and she can do it herself. \n\nSeveral other people saw this and now no one is helping her anymore. \n\nI feel awful about it. I know she definitely needs help and didn't mean for any of this. I feel like an a hole.\n\nEdit- I didn't even think about bedbugs and other bitey things. I was just freaking out over the roaches. \n\nNow I'm more paranoid and my husband and I are searching the house to make sure nothing came home with me. Though the washer is in a room of its own connected to the carport and I wash everything as soon as I get home including my underwear and then shower. \n\nI did braid my hair and had it up so nothing could really get into it. Hopefully I didn't bring anything home.

Rule of Life #17. Never ever speak disparagingly to someone who is helping you with a disgusting task. You have ample reason to stop helping her, at least until she apologizes. As far as the others, they are adults and made their own decisions. Maybe they were looking for a reason to bail too.", "NTA I am assuming not helping anymore has nothing to do with you.

A lot of people have probably just realised this , and don\u2019t want to help if they believe the situation is \n\nA. Hopeless or B.

If you are asking family to come help you clean up YEARS of your unaddressed mess AND roaches, you better be pretty darn humble about it. A cleaning company would charge them a fortune for this, and you are helping out of the goodness of your heart. If she\u2019s offended by you changing in the garage, that\u2019s just too darn bad. \n\nI know hoarding is at least related to mental illness, and I know she\u2019s got to be feeling very vulnerable right now.

So other people that saw that probably felt she's not thankful for them helping her either.  Who wants to waste their time helping someone who disrespects and isn't thankful for their help?

Except there\u2019s no mental health professional keeping the hoarder under control. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA, obviously. You literally helped, got on your knees and got your hands dirty for this person, and she responded by barking at you out of embarrassment. That was rude and also ungrateful. Why would you, or anybody else, want to continue helping a person like that?\n\nIf you or others get past this negative exchange, return for help with an outside party, a trained professional or some sort of mediator. This lady ain\u2019t right. And as you guys are family, emotions are high and history exists.

She has some nerve.", "I grew up with the things after the slumlord neighbor bombed his building.\n\nNTA", "NTA on so many levels \ud83e\udd2e", "NTA with a gentle AH to the result. It wasn't cool at all that SIL was an ass to you, but I'm guessing her emotions are running high. I mean, she had her kids taken away, and a has bunch of people in her home, probably feeling like she's failing at life or something and judged by everyone, and she took your actions the wrong way and reacted harshly. If she wouldn't let you explain, you could have explained to everyone else your severe phobia of roaches and that while SIL reaction wasn't fair by any means, but she and her family really do need the help.\n\nEdit: Cool, cool. Getting downvoted for being on the side of compassion for all. OP wasn't wrong for anything she did, she has legitimate trauma from an awful childhood experience (if not just an awful childhood, period). It was kind of her to put her issues aside and to help her SIL in her time of need. All that said, SIL is going through it right now, and helping her doesn't just mean helping clean her house, it means helping HER too.\n\nHow her house got that way is likely the result of some mental health issues. Yes, her house needs to be cleaned, but SHE also needs help. Of course, SIL should be thankful for the help cleaning her house, but she's also clearly having a mental health crisis of some kind, whether a hoarder facing distress at her things being removed, the angst of knowing the condition of her home causing her children to be removed, feeling intense embarrassment and shame for the state of her home and that everyone is now looking at her mess, a combination or all of the above. Why shouldn't there be some compassion for her mental state and circumstances right now? I'm sure she will be thankful once she can get the mental health she needs on top of her house being cleaned and getting her kids back. Once the dust has settled a bit and she is not still in them middle of a crisis. Sheesh.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
