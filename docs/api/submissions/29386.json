{"id": 29386, "submission_id": "17dd2xy", "title": "AITA for causing everyone to stop helping my SIL?", "selftext": "My(30) husband(34) has a sister we will call  M(33). M and her husband have 4 children. Both M and her husband are very loud and always angry and fighting over something so we don't talk to them much.\n\nRecently the children were removed from their care and placed in the care of my MIL. M has asked everyone in the family to help them. They need their home cleaned and several other things. So I went to their home to help. I had no idea how bad their home was, I haven't been there in years. They have a serious roach infestation. Not the big wood roaches that come in sometimes, I'm talking the little disgusting ones that get into everything and can't get rid of and will take home with you by accident. They also had wall to wall stacks of trash and just about everything imaginable on the floors/ counters. I couldn't even see floor in most places. So we cleaned and cleaned and my husband and FIL paid for a dumpster to be brought. It took us several days of cleaning to even see floors and we still have tons more to do. \n\n I am terrified of roaches. My dad used to hold me down when I was little and put them on my face when he was mad. So I wear gloves and coveralls and am trying to do my best not to panic. However I've been ridiculously paranoid since starting this. I can feel them crawling on me even when I know I'm clean fresh out the shower. I refuse to bring any of those roaches with me home. I strip to my underwear before even getting in my car and change into shorts and a tank top and shove everything I wore into a garbage bag to wash immediately when I get home. \n\nApparently M saw me strip and shove everything into the bag and got very upset. She asked me if I thought I was better than her and made it a huge issue. Honestly I just don't want roaches in my house at all. They are gross and terrifying and near impossible to get rid of. \n\nI tried to explain but she just got angrier so I just told her if this was her way of thanking me for my help I can leave and she can do it herself. \n\nSeveral other people saw this and now no one is helping her anymore. \n\nI feel awful about it. I know she definitely needs help and didn't mean for any of this. I feel like an a hole.\n\nEdit- I didn't even think about bedbugs and other bitey things. I was just freaking out over the roaches. \n\nNow I'm more paranoid and my husband and I are searching the house to make sure nothing came home with me. Though the washer is in a room of its own connected to the carport and I wash everything as soon as I get home including my underwear and then shower. \n\nI did braid my hair and had it up so nothing could really get into it. Hopefully I didn't bring anything home. \n\nEdit2 - I am working on commenting but thank you everyone for making me feel better and giving me tips to avoid bringing anything inside. I don't have a dryer I mostly hang to dry so I will take the coveralls to the laundry mat. They haven't been brought inside our home at all because I'm paranoid. My husband and I are going to ask our pest control guy to take a second look at everything though and spray extra this month to make sure I didn't bring home anything. \n\nFinal edit- thank you everyone for helping me feel better and giving me advice. I really appreciate it. I am so sorry to everyone I traumatized with my trauma. I do see a therapist and am being proactive about making sure no bugs came home with me. I'm going to bed since it's around midnight here. Again Thank you.

It wasn't cool at all that SIL was an ass to you, but I'm guessing her emotions are running high. I mean, she had her kids taken away, and a has bunch of people in her home, probably feeling like she's failing at life or something and judged by everyone, and she took your actions the wrong way and reacted harshly. If she wouldn't let you explain, you could have explained to everyone else your severe phobia of roaches and that while SIL reaction wasn't fair by any means, but she and her family really do need the help.\n\nEdit: Cool, cool. Getting downvoted for being on the side of compassion for all. OP wasn't wrong for anything she did, she has legitimate trauma from an awful childhood experience (if not just an awful childhood, period). It was kind of her to put her issues aside and to help her SIL in her time of need. All that said, SIL is going through it right now, and helping her doesn't just mean helping clean her house, it means helping HER too.\n\nHow her house got that way is likely the result of some mental health issues. Yes, her house needs to be cleaned, but SHE also needs help. Of course, SIL should be thankful for the help cleaning her house, but she's also clearly having a mental health crisis of some kind, whether a hoarder facing distress at her things being removed, the angst of knowing the condition of her home causing her children to be removed, feeling intense embarrassment and shame for the state of her home and that everyone is now looking at her mess, a combination or all of the above. Why shouldn't there be some compassion for her mental state and circumstances right now? I'm sure she will be thankful once she can get the mental health she needs on top of her house being cleaned and getting her kids back.

However, you have every right and are SMART to take every precaution to not take pests home with you. You are not a pest control service and you are helping out of the kindness of your hearts. If you continue helping, she owes you an apology - *but you might not get it*. SIL likely needs counseling for hoarding tendencies.\n\nAs a side note: I have an intense fear of ants and bug infestations. I had relatives growing up that I spent a lot of time with who struggled to maintain their home - similar to the roaches here. That kind of anxiety can linger. Do what you need to do to avoid panic.

How does two able bodied adults, 4 kids or not, get into such a state of disgusting mess? How does having other people come in and clean it up fix the cause of such a mess?

Blah blah blah.\n\nIn the end my family stopped, my friends stopped because these people cared more about what they could get than the health of me or my baby. (He was fine) \n\nI haven\u2019t spoken to them since. I do know that the youngest child was taken into care by his father, and the 2 other kids stayed and the house ended up even more disgusting.

My scrubs go into a plastic bag and then into a bin in the garage where they wait to be washed. Work shoes are sprayed with disinfectant and never come inside.

I can understand how SIL\u2019s feelings might be hurt, but she can(and probably will) get over it. people shouldn\u2019t quit helping, but maybe be a little more realistic about realizing what they can also do to minimize the risk of bringing anything into their homes.
