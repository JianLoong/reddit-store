{"id": 5583, "submission_id": "zupr4r", "title": "AITA for expecting people to put their pets in another room when I visit because of allergies?", "selftext": "I'm allergic to cats and dogs - as a kid I had to go to an ER twice for difficult breathing after attending sleepovers at a home with pets. I've avoided ER visits as an adult by being really cautious. It's very scary for me when I have trouble breathing. I have had the practice of asking people to put their pets in another room when I'm visiting (of course there will still be dander in the environment, but having the pet in a different room helps a lot). I didn't think this was a big ask, but I've gotten a lot of pushback. One time a friend said she'd do it, but then she didn't close the door and acted all surprised when the dog came into the room, and didn't try to put the dog out again. It seems pretty obvious that the dog won't stay in another room if you don't close the door, so I thought maybe it was a passive aggressive refusal. Another friend did as I asked once (we went in the basement, dogs stayed in the rest of the house - they barked and whined at the door for awhile but then went away), and I thought it went well, but the next time I suggested getting together at her house the friend refused because of the dogs. I haven't been there since. Another time I went to a get together at a friend's place, and when I asked her about putting the cat in another room, she said no because others want to play with the cat. This sort of thing happens often enough that I've given up on asking - I just leave early when I have the first sign of allergies. I manage, but I also feel bitter and hurt that my friends are so unwilling to make a safe and comfortable place for me. So I thought I'd ask the internet - AITA? Is it unreasonable to expect people to put their pets in another room when I visit?\n\nETA: ok I think I should clarify what I mean by \u2018expect\u2019. I\u2019m not showing up at people\u2019s houses and telling people to banish their dogs on the spot. When a friend who I know has a pet invited me or a group over I was in the practice of explaining about my allergies and asking if the pet can be in a different room AT THE TIME I WAS INVITED. Meaning before I went over. I expected that the answer would be yes in the same way that if someone was invited to dinner and asked their host \u2018could you not serve peanuts? I\u2019m allergic\u2019 I would expect the host\u2019s response to be \u2018sure\u2019 not \u2018no, we serve peanuts at every meal, we cannot be without peanuts at any time.\u2019", "created_utc": 1671939503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zupr4r/aita_for_expecting_people_to_put_their_pets_in/", "score": 356, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have a dog and a cat. When I invite someone over, I make sure they know about my pets If they say they're allergic then I just say \"Ok, my place is out. Let's got to a restaurant or hang somewhere that isn't my house.\" I wouldn't want to expose a friend to an allergen and I wouldn't want to distress my dog by isolating him.

Of course if your friend leaves the door open, the pets going to come out! That's really irritating that your friend did that!", "If you ask the pet owner BEFORE you visit, AND they agree, nta.  But \"expecting\" someone to do this, without REQUESTING,  (not \"expecting), before you visit is, essentially, making a demand, which would make yta. \n\nAlso, (not that you asked), given the severity of your allergy, maybe it's best you simply don't visit a home where pets live. The pet hair is still in the room, even if the pet isn't.", "NTA.

There\u2019d be whining and crying and a lot of carrying on and it would make me worry and would just be a miserable time.

Maybe find new friends- they won't  change.  That said, NAH b/c there is also the bottom line that in the examples you provided you were a guest in their homes.  You have the right to ask and they have the right to say no.  They have shown you clearly that the pets are higher priority than you.  It is up to you what you want to do with that information.", "NTA\n\nYou have an allergy that can possibly kill you. Not something to screw around with.\n\nYour friends invite you over.

I just had a party and we put our cat in a bedroom with food and a litter box.  Two guests were very allergic.  We also vacuumed like crazy before they came.  We made these accommodations because they were both invited to our home.  It\u2019s just basic kindness and part of hospitality when you invite someone to your home. The cat can deal with it for a couple of hours.", "NAH\n\nIt's not unreasonable to ask. We are a food allergy family, so I understand allergies and their struggles. However, when it comes to pets, whether they are in another room or not, the allergen is all over the house already. I wouldn't take my son to a cheese factory as he has an anaphylaxic allergy to dairy. IMO, this is a similar scenario. I have friends who have severe pet allergies, so they don't come to my home, we both understand its just not worth the risk. I would recommend you skip visits at pet households, host at your home, or in public.", "NTA\n\nI say this because when you are invited you clarify when accepting that the pets will be housed in another room.  It sounds like when you get there you suddenly find that that's not the case at all.\n\nIn this instance I would just repeat what your friend who invited you said ie yes I will put the animals in another room.  And if they tell you they still can't or they didn't say that.  Just say thanks, you'll be off, unfortunately you can't stay as you don't feel like a hospital visit this evening.\n\nYour friends will then realise you are serious and will do what they say they will do.  Or they weren't your friends in the first place and stop inviting you but that's not loss.", "NTA. Honestly it's not that unreasonable. I have two big dogs, and a lot of friends who are not that comfortable with them, some are quite afraid. I let them play in the garden or terrace when my friends are over. Its not always my way or highway. If I am inviting someone, then i need to accommodate them. Or I can chose to forfeit their friendship and stay alone with my dogs in my home, which, i dont think is always acceptable..", "NAH. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with asking. Some people will say yes, some won\u2019t. For some people it\u2019s an easier accommodation to make than it is for others. Some cats will just go hang out in another room with no problem, others are used to roaming the house and will scratch at the door. Some dogs will be fine in their kennel with a noise machine, others will cry and bark the whole time knowing there are people in the house they can\u2019t greet. \n\nThere\u2019s also nothing wrong with you feeling upset that you can\u2019t join in group gatherings because of allergy issues. It\u2019s fair for you to feel that way, as long as you aren\u2019t being an AH to people because of those feelings. I don\u2019t think anyone is in the wrong in this situation, it\u2019s just a shitty reality of having allergies.", "If i invite you over and you have allergies..ill do so much prep work to be conscientious of your allergies. My dog has been trained to be by himself without losing his shit. He can be in a room alone for a bit..relax..nap..enjoy a treat..behave and cope. I vacuum, clean and open windows. So NTA if i invite you over..im honest about expectations and i try...but living with a pyrenees is never safe for hair. :(\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBUT if I didnt invite you with knowledge..sorry. Dog hair everywhere and no way to quickly remedy that fact...and some dogs arent trained to be by themselves for a bit for whatever reason..(many reasons)...so guess it just depends on circumstance..but most people know that when they come to my house, expect to find a dog hair in something..somewhere lol", "NAH you can ask for the accommodations, maybe even explain that with the pet in the room you will only be able to stay a short amount of time because of how severe your allergies are. But they are also allowed to chose their pet. For some people pets are the most important thing in their life so they may be unwilling to make them uncomfortable. Also, I hope you have a top notch allergist and have pursued all your treatment options.", "NTA.  I've always thought it was common courtesy.", "This really sucks and I know because I've been there (I'm very allergic to cats and dogs). You are not the AH for sharing your allergens as this can impact your well-being or other times, be life threatening. But you are the AH for expecting your hosts just to cater to this with no accountability on your end. At the end of the day, it is your health that you need to care for and that responsibility doesn't fall on other people - yes, they should be mindful of it if they're good friends and you should also be mindful with reading in between the lines if they seem annoyed by it (and coming up with another solution).\n\nHere are some of my best practices. If I do go to someone's place and they have cats and dogs, I would suggest we hangout outside if the weather permits. If weather doesn't permit, I take antihistamines 2hrs prior, double mask up, and extra clothes to change when I leave. Wash your hands and resist the temptation of touching your face. I'll usually shower immediately and do laundry as soon as I get home. I know it sounds excessive and in a perfect world, I shouldn't have to do this, but this is my reality if I want to share space with my friends. Other times, I'll just offer up my space to host or find a middle location so all these things could be avoided.\n\nI hope this helps!", "I was like NAH until your \u201cclarification\u201d of expectation being that you don\u2019t think they have any reason or right to reject your request of isolating their pets when you grace their homes with your presence then I just thought you must be hard to be around, entitled and annoying. It also doesn\u2019t help that you seem to just go when they don\u2019t want to remove their pets so to them it might be that you can cope and are just being difficult. Also maybe cause these friends don\u2019t seem to particularly mind when you leave on the onset of your allergies they must not value your presence all that much and maybe you should stay away a bit and see if they miss you at all.", "The allergens are already all over the house. Putting the pets in another room prevents licking, climbing, humping etc however. While it is your health, it is their home. People consider pets as family so, it would be like asking if they could put their kid in the basement,  locked in a room. I can easily see how this would wear thin on people. \n\nUnfortunately, this means more pet less friends  , outdoor meetings or meetings at venues with just them. Sucks, but keeps you in good physical shape while not pissing ppl off", "NTA- it\u2019s a fair request especially of how allergic you are. However this should be under the concept of them inviting you over and agreeing to those terms beforehand. If you invited yourself over with the expectation, then \u201cyou are the asshole\u201d for not communicating the parameters of the hang out and assumed they will just do it. Ppl adore their pets and some pets have separation anxiety so while no brained to you, you also don\u2019t know the pet.  \n\nI would prolly either just invite them over to my place and avoid the pet all together or meet at a mutual third space without the pet.", "NAH\n\nYou can ask. I personally would suggest that you not come to my house because I won't lock up members of my family who live in the house.\n\nI don't eat at other people's houses because of my severe food allergies. I realize that others cannot fully accommodate my allergies and I'm ok with that.", "I'm shocked by the comments. Of course NTA! It's entirely reasonable for people to put their pets in another room or a crate. There may be some rare exceptions where that's not a possibility - a pet with extreme behavioral needs, a service dog - but on the whole the host should expect to manage their pet.", "Instead of asking them to place their pets in another room, you can politely decline to go if there are pets around. If you choose to ask, when you tell them your situation and they still refuse to make accommodations for you to be comfortable, you don\u2019t have to put yourself at risk. Your health and well-being is important, and a friend who doesn\u2019t care about your safety is not being a good friend to you.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s okay to ask as long as you\u2019re not phrasing it as a demand.\n\nNAH.", "I wouldn\u2019t invite you to my house. \nTake an antihistamine and wash your hands.\nDon\u2019t touch your eyes.\nAnd where a layered top to remove one as you leave.

I can put him in a different room for a few minutes if I have to answer the door or clean up a mess, but it is different to put him in a different room when there are people. He will whine and bark and be very stressed. The fallout of this is a very untrusting dog who I will need to give special attention for days to get him back in line. Locking him in another room is something I would only do for emergencies.\n\nBut I would make sure that you can be included if I meet with you. So we would not meet at my place, but somewhere else and I would leave my dog at home or at a relative for this time.

This is all personal preference but I fully believe pets are part of the family and while I don\u2019t control my allergy, neither do the cats. \n\nNow your friend who said they would but didn\u2019t put the dog away is kind of an asshole.

Or meet on neutral ground. You\u2019re entitled if you expect anything else.", "NAH.   Your request is reasonable.   These days people generally treat their pets as four-legged hairy children (\"fur babies\") as opposed to animals - which is why you are getting so much pushback.", "NTA.

If it\u2019s, say, two or so hours or less, it may not be unreasonable, but if it\u2019s several hours, then there may be bathroom/food/boredom issues that you aren\u2019t considering. If I had to close my cats up in a room for four hours for one person, I may have to move a litter box or move food bowls and a water fountain\u2014and my cats are relatively healthy. If they had health concerns, I may not be able to close them up at certain times of the day. As for dogs, some high energy dogs would not do well closed up in a room\u2014they might destroy furniture out of boredom. Puppies also need more time and attention and wouldn\u2019t do well being left alone for long period of time. And this is all outside of the fact that a lot of people see their pets as full members of their family.", "You\u2019re not unreasonable, per say, I think unrealistic might be a better term. People don\u2019t often realize how serious pet allergies can be, and when they consider their pet a part of the family they think it\u2019s cruel to separate them. There\u2019s also the case of poorly trained pets/pets with separation anxiety where it\u2019s just not super feasible without destruction. \n\nI\u2019d either meet at your house or somewhere outside the home for your friends with pets. Or work with your doctor to find the right daily antihistamine combination that limits your symptoms as much as possible. \n\nNTA.", "Your friends are the AHs. They invite you, aware of your predicament,  agree to accommodate you, and then don't? For an evening? F man if that's how they act with their animals I'd hate to see how the kids they raise turn out.", "YTA. I feel like it's unreasonable to ask for special accommodations. If you know they have pets, then either don't go over there or get some medication you can take that would help. You could try informing them that you will come over but that you'll have to leave early if your allergies start acting up. With any luck, they will offer to put their pet in another room. But I feel like you're out of line to make the request yourself. If you are someone who dislikes children, you can't exactly request that they not be present if you're going to a house with children. I think the fact that so many of your friends seem to have issues with your requests is a clear indication that you are overstepping.", "Peanuts don't get sad when they're not included in the fun.", "NTA- anyone saying differently doesn\u2019t have a disability.", "Yeah YTA & I don\u2019t think you understand how your own allergy works. \n\nDog and cat allergies are specific to a protein that is found in there that skin, saliva and urine.  Domestic cats have a smaller amount of the specific proteins possible, so people who are allergic to a protein, have a higher chance of having the allergy to many other cats. However, because these proteins are not breed or litter specific, a person who has an allergy to one specific cat or dog, does not necessarily have an allergy to all breeds of that animal. \n\nCat and dog allergies are triggered by dander/dead skin, urine and saliva. If someone is allergic to cat/dog placing the pet in another room while they visit a home does not change their allergy experience. The home of the animal is covered in their dead skin just as it is household dust is made of human shed skin. The allergy to cats/dogs is not made worse if the animal is in the room or even if you pet it; most allergic reactions to pets are cause by the inhalation of their dander which is floating through the air of their home space. \n\nIf you are visiting somebody\u2019s home, who has a cat and you are allergic to cats them sectioning off the animal will not change how your body reacts\u2026  their dander will be all around you as soon as you enter the home. \n\nIf you know you have an animal allergy it is your responsibility to ask if people have those pets in their home and then DONT GO THERE.  You have the same responsibility for maintaining your medical safety concerning your allergens as people who have food, allergies do- it is your job to ask questions and make necessary arrangements.", "YTA - my pets live here everyday. They are part of my family. My cats like my friends and family and greet them at the door. To me it would be like you asking to put a person into another room. \nI have a friend who is really allergic to cats. You know what we do? I try to get my clothes as free of cat fur as possible and visit her at her place. She never asked once to put my cats away but always just offered to host instead. She even apologized for me always having to go to her place since she can\u2019t really visit mine.", "YTA, if your allergies are bad enough to send you to the ER, what difference does a pet being put away when the pet dander is probably all over the houses where they live? \n\nWhy are you even chancing it if your allergies are so bad?", "YTA because you can ask but past that you\u2019re the asshole. They can say no but you want to dictate what people do in their homes. It\u2019s the fact that you expect them to do it that makes you an asshole", "YTA\n\nYou're not the AH for asking, but EXPECTING people to cater to you in their home is most definitely an asshole play", "You wouldn\u2019t be TA if you asked them and then accepted their answer, but expecting them to comply does kind of make YTA.", "YTA - in the sense of expecting people to conform to your desires in their own home, but NTA in the sense of trying to avoid something that causes you difficulty.  People aren't always the sharpest crayons, and often minimize the suffering of others when they aren't suffering the same way.  Probably the best way to handle this is to politely decline to visit, instead inviting them to meet you elsewhere, where you don't have to worry about their pets.  No need to announce the reason or argue with them over it.  You need to do what's best for you, but you also need to understand it's their home and their pet lives there.  Do what's best for you on your turf, or on neutral turf, not on theirs.", "YTA\n\nAlso putting the pets in another room would do nothing to help your allergies if they live in the house, so either this is BS or you're a hypochondriac.", "YTA - You are going to that animal's home and demanding it be locked up because of your visit. For most people locking their pets up when they are home is a punishment. It's not fair to expect your friends to punish their pet because you have an allergy. \n\nYou can easily host friends at your home pet free or meet them out in public pet free. If you insist on going to people's homes that have pets then it is your responsibility to deal with your allergies. You can leave like you are now or you could explore allergy medications. \n\nFeeling bitter because your friends won't bend to your will is your own problem. You asked and your friends said no. They're not obligated to accommodate your demands.", "YTA. That's the pets home, not yours. They have more of a right to be there than you do. If you can't be in the home, then don't go.", "That is the animals home, they live there, you do not. I feel like it is rude to ask. Try taking some allergy meds if you know you are going to a home with animals.

I've avoided ER visits as an adult by being really cautious. It's very scary for me when I have trouble breathing. I have had the practice of asking people to put their pets in another room when I'm visiting (of course there will still be dander in the environment, but having the pet in a different room helps a lot). I didn't think this was a big ask, but I've gotten a lot of pushback. One time a friend said she'd do it, but then she didn't close the door and acted all surprised when the dog came into the room, and didn't try to put the dog out again. It seems pretty obvious that the dog won't stay in another room if you don't close the door, so I thought maybe it was a passive aggressive refusal. Another friend did as I asked once (we went in the basement, dogs stayed in the rest of the house - they barked and whined at the door for awhile but then went away), and I thought it went well, but the next time I suggested getting together at her house the friend refused because of the dogs. I haven't been there since. Another time I went to a get together at a friend's place, and when I asked her about putting the cat in another room, she said no because others want to play with the cat. This sort of thing happens often enough that I've given up on asking - I just leave early when I have the first sign of allergies. I manage, but I also feel bitter and hurt that my friends are so unwilling to make a safe and comfortable place for me. So I thought I'd ask the internet - AITA? It is unreasonable to expect people to put their pets in another room when I visit?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Not a dog person at all, but of my friends with dogs, I only know of one who crate trained theirs. A neighbor's dog was able to completely destroy a carpet from his crate. And WHERE the crate is is also important. If the crate is normally in the living room, and they move it to the bedroom, the dog may act out! You're not being an asshole for asking. You enter asshole territory when you compare it to asking for peanut butter to be off the menu. Not serving something made with peanuts is completely different from confining a living being. I'll bend over backwards to meet pretty much any dietary restriction, especially one that could kill you.

They also love and care for their pets so I think sometimes they just won\u2019t invite you to their homes as an easier solution.

On the other hand, asking the host to put the animal in another room seems vaguely disingenuous, as I know without a shadow of a doubt, that there is a ton of dander all over the house even though we clean frequently.  So it seems to me that putting a pet in another room will have a negligible effect, which would make me less likely to acquiesce to the request.  I have an incredible lovely friend who is so allergic to pets that he doesn't come to events hosted by those of us with pets unless it is outdoors, which is sad, but he has gotten mild symptoms before after sitting next to me on a bus for 3 hours before, just from the cat and dog hair on my winter coat.  \n\nI'm also struck by OP's note that she has been invited somewhere, where in the example she gave, OP suggested going to her friend's house, which in my book is NOT 'being invited.'\n\nI do wonder if OP's friends don't particularly want her around, or perhaps the people who have to host more frequently are getting tired of it, or perhaps the pet owners who WANT to host occasionally are getting tired of being made to feel like they have to revolve around OP's needs.  \n\nSoft YTA or N A H to OP.", "That reeks of entitlement?

It doesn't happen often, but when it does I feel like a bully.
