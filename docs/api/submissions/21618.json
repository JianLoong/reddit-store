Maybe you weren't nice about it, but he pulled an ESSENTIAL medication off of your chart and then started a turf war with you.  I don't blame you for being mad.

He should have remedied his instead of doubling down.", "NTA - He is punishing you.  *If only you were NICER?*\n\nA detailed complaint of facts in writing goes to the doctor overseeing this resident. If he is a doctor-in-resident a copy of the detailed complaint is presented to him as well. Depending on the outcome you should consider a board complaint.  His inability to explain changes to your treatment plan is absurd and not proper practice plus he had you on the phone and instead of listening and informing you he mistreats you so you suffer and not repeat your behavior. This is outrageous.", "NTA - but i don\u2019t see why you would also include your own doctor as well as the asshole doctor in the complaint (unless this is an international thing, i live in uk)", "NTA Don't wait to file that complaint.

Messing with someone's medication without a consult is a good way to lose your medical license, which there is a real chance of this happening if you report him.", "Don\u2019t call. GO! Go directly to your doctor\u2019s office the minute they open. Do not leave there without having seen your doctor, not the resident. Bring your husband, too - he can attest to the threats and delusional behavior. That resident should not be practicing medicine. \n\nNTA.", "Nta.  I work in a doctors office as a nurse.  Sometimes medication changes are made before an appointment due to labs but patients are always notified.  If a change in your medication is necessary, you have the right to know why.   Before you go scorched earth and report this guy and your physician to the medical board be advised you may be looking for a new physician as they may refuse you to see you anymore.  This may cause further delays in your treatment.  If you have enough medication until Monday, I would advise calling back and speaking to the office manager.  Or continue trying to get in touch with your own physician.  You are within your rights to refuse the resident to be involved with your care so if you otherwise like your physician, try to work it out.  Good luck.", "NTA. Your medication should never be stopped or changed without discussing it with you first. The only reason I could think of was maybe you were out of refills and needed an appointment for a refill but that doesn't sound like that was the case. He should have never called you upset and told you that you're wasting his time, instead he should have explained to you the rationale behind his medical decision. He also can't prevent you from being able to schedule an appointment because you weren't nice to him. \n\nCall the patient complaint line and explain everything to them. Also make sure that they note that you should never be scheduled with him.", "NTA.  Losing access to your insulin is a danger to your health, if not life. A doctor is not God. A doctor must explain his actions. You should report this one to your actual doctor for everything, the medication, his refusal to explain, his attitude, and that \"learn your lesson\".\n\nThis should be reported to your doctor and whatever board regulates the resident.", "Unless you have a history of issues, your pharmacy will generally give you an emergency 5-day supply of critical medications like insulin and will contact your prescribing provider for needed refills that aren't controlled substances.", "You can also purchase old-school insulin without a prescription for around $25/vial.", "NTA. You shouldn't need an appt to get a refill called in. \n\nJeopardizing your access to insulin + telling you there's a secret plan that you're not privy to + \"I'm going to make you wait to teach you a lesson about being nice\" absolutely warrants a complaint to the medical board, IMO. I would follow up with your doctor summarizing the above in writing and notifying him that you are not willing to be seen  by this resident again.", "NTA fulfill your threats for the sake of the next person to deal with this creep! This is fucking school teacher power tripping style behaviour, and you are a fucking adult who deserves to be treated with basic human dignity and respect. Please please don't let this go. You deserved better and so will every other patient this guy is inflicted on.", "Hell no! NTA.", "NTA.  You went overboard with the personal insults, but pointing out his errors in managing your medications is completely legitimate to that point that stating this rises to the level of reporting to the state licensing board is as legit well.\n\nAlso, if you're in a teaching hospital or clinic with residents rotating through, you can refuse treatment by a medical resident.  Yes, they've graduated medical school and can use MD or DO in their title, but they have not completed their training (typically 3 years of residency for family practice or internal medicine) and their license is not for practicing medicine independently, only under the supervising of their attending doctors while in an approved teaching program.  They may have trouble working you in to see a non-resident or refer you to a different clinic, but you can pursue that through the attending or a program director if the scheduler gives you any trouble.  \n\nThat is, if everything is as straightforward as the OP states.  If they OTOH had replied to numerous requests to come in for an appointment to review their status, medications, and perhaps draw blood for labs, then it is proper for the physician to stop a prescription.  Certain drugs require a prescription for a reason - there are side effects, some of them long-term, and many drugs, like insulin, may need to adjusted based on more recent exams and labs.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
