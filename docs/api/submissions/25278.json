Look at it this way, your husband's money could have been spent a thousand different ways that DIDN'T help your parents--the two of you did the right thing here.  Let your aunt spend her money on a drug addict ex-con, but I'm willing to bet she won't see the same return on her investment.", "NTA Assuming your future husband is paying something close to market value, it sounds like a win-win. Your aunt and brother Tim can investigate all they want. A long as you have proper and legal documentation, all they can do is have professionals explain things to them.", "NTA\n\nTim's not entitled to **any** of your parents assets. He's certainly not ever stepping in to take care of them.", "NTA. Tim sounds like he just wants to stir shit up and guilt-trip you into giving him money. Ask him if he plans on taking care of Dad in his final months. You and your husband are doing your folks a favor by owning the house. You've removed a huge worry from their minds so your parents can just enjoy whatever time they have left together.", "INFO Why is your aunt saying that you took advantage of them? Did you buy the house far under market value?", "NTA - while you and your husband are benefiting from the house it sounds like this deal really benefits your parents. Not only do they have you there to cover expenses and help out, but your dad has basically guaranteed that when he passes, he doesn\u2019t have to worry about your mom. She\u2019ll be able to stay in their home, have companionship and caregivers, and won\u2019t need to worry about needing to find sources of income to survive and cover medical bills.\n\nAlso, if this was simply out of desperation, your dad wouldn\u2019t have made sure you two were married so you had a legal right to the place. \n\nI can say from experience your brother and aunt are mostly just pissed they won\u2019t be able to make money off of any sale or loot the place when your parents pass. This is just about money they imagine they are losing out on and nothing more. And as long as you follow through on your agreement and take care of your mom and dad, there\u2019s no court that would consider this \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of anyone.", "Your parents are getting free in-home care from people who love them during their final days, and your home purchase allowed your mom to retire and spend time with her dying husband.\n\n It's priceless. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, but really, it only matters what Tim thinks.  Stay safe!  Restrain!  Lawyer!", "NTA. I fail to see on any level how your brother was cheated out of anything. You and your husband bought a house in need of repairs that your parents couldn't afford to upkeep. It's not like they just gave you the house in exchange for a roof. \n\nHad you and your husband not bought the house, it likely would have been sold to help downsize or to fund medical expenses.  Sorry Tim, time to grow up and start adulting!", "Go on the offense and get a lawyer!!! NTA", "NTA. You came up with the best solution. The house would have either been sold or remortgaged  and money used for your father's care, and they wouldn't even have a house anymore. Anyone who criticizes your actions is being greedy, counting on an inheritance that was only imaginary.", " NTA you both did a good thing.  Don\u2019t let Tim in the house, it\u2019s yours.

I understand your reasoning, but legally, you could be in for a challenge from your brother. NAH.", "I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re an asshole, but you\u2019re probably not making good financial decisions. This year you\u2019ll owe capital gains taxes for the difference between the current value of the house and what your parents paid originally minus whatever gift limit there is now (minus the $34k gift limit).

NTA.", "NTA\n\nOP only put up what they were going to use as a down payment, so likely nowhere near market value. Sounds like OP got a fantastic deal on the house in exchange for taking care of OP\u2019s parents. \n\nIt\u2019s hardly surprising Tim\u2019s pissed, but OP\u2019s arrangement seems fair and reasonable as long as the parents are good with the arrangement.", ">Assuming your future husband is paying something close to market value\n\n\"Both my dad him made a deal that he will put what was going to be a down payment in our own home on the my parents house and we buy them out.\"\n\nI fear that OP's fiance DID take advantage of OP's parents, and I really hope OP clarifies otherwise. It sounds like they put their down payment money into repairs and took over utilities and maintenance in exchange for the house- meaning the parents' surrendered their current legal right to live there. If they just committed to leaving OP and her fiance the house in their will, I feel differently.", "Still not her business because both parents want this and under market value would still make sense. They don't have to work anymore.  They have more support and won't have to worry about moving to a home or assisted living if they can't keep up with a home.

They can live comfortably now and be taken care of by family all being together.  Your mom doesn't have to work a waitressing job, which can be very taxing and on your feet all day.  \n\nYour aunt sounds like the problem here. Your brother isn't in his right mind, but what's wrong with your aunt?", "Perhaps I\u2019m misunderstanding. The inheritance part comes after they die\u2026 they\u2019re trying to help them out. It\u2019s pretty shitty to withhold help because you\u2019d be much better off if you just wait till the person who needs help dies\u2026\n\n\u201cSorry pops, I\u2019d love to help but you\u2019re way more useful to me dead\u201d", "What are you even talking about? They didn\u2019t inherit anything. There are no capital gains, they sold their primary home that they\u2019ve had for more than two years. Just\u2026. What?", "That's not how capital gains tax works.  You pay said tax upon selling of an asset not when you purchase it.  Even then - it's a time-based tax.  You can fully avoid this tax if you live in a home (as primary residence) for \"two out of the last five years (up to the date of closing).\"\n\nFurther - it's not a gift or inheritance.  It's a private sale.", "I'm reading it as - a deal was made that:\n\n1. OP's fianc\u00e9's planned down payment towards a (different) house would instead go to the parents house for any needed repairs or renovations (e.g., the roof).\n2. OP and her fianc\u00e9 would buy the home from them (the price would probably be overall fair, but also lean in the benefit to OP).", "Their moving in to take care of the parents and continued paying of the bills and taxes can also be considered payment", "To me it sounds like a good deal. Unless OP and husband bought the house for a dollar. But even then if they okayed it then it won't matter and aunt doesn't have a case. OP did not describe her parents as if they are mentally unsound so OP shouldn't have anything to worry about. Other than money to pay a lawyer to fight a frivolous suit if the aunt actually goes through with it.

Buying it rather than inheriting it is a bad financial decision.", "This is how I read it originally, but when I went back I really am not convinced part 2 happened.", "Absolutely, and I have no issue with them inheriting  the house. My issue is if they took legal title to the house BEFORE fulfilling those commitments (or legally binding themselves to them), which is imo taking advantage of the parents'desperation.", "Mon was literally working in a job that requires memory, balance, and being on your feet all day.

They have every right to sell their house and/or to \"cut him out financially,\" especially where their daughter is helping them and the son is only trying to take.", "Sometimes the correct decision in your life is a bad financial decision.", "It's also a bad financial decision to put money into a property you don't own or have no legal claim to.", "She did it when her father was old and sick. He could make a case against her, especially if she didn't pay market rate for the house.", "But the mom owns the house too and is of sound mind and body. They can prove that. She's still working, and was actually able to quit. Nothing about this is illegal or shady.", "Why would he have a \u201cright\u201d to any of the parents things? Can\u2019t they give their possessions to whoever they want to?", "That's up to the lawyers to hash out. It can definitely be perceived as shady. They weren't planning on selling the house. OP talked them into the deal.", "It really depends. If the brother's lawyer asserts the OP took advantage of them, it could get ugly.", "No, this would require a finding by the court that the parents are unable to make legal decisions for themselves.  Cancer does not render someone mentally incompetent, and there's zero argument as to the mom.\n\nETA: In any event, with the parents still alive, even if OP engaged in misconduct, the \"victims\" entitled to redress would be her parents, NOT the brother.  He simply doesn't have standing or a claim.  And with his background, he's not qualified to be appointed their POA, etc.", "The brother doesn\u2019t have a lawyer and won\u2019t get one. He just got out of jail. Is he going to pay with his left over commissary?", "We don't know everything that's going on with him. We don't know what medication he's on. We kbow nothing about the mom.

Who's to say he doesn't get a job if he really wants to fight?", "Ok judge judy wanna be", "How do the brother or aunt even bring this to court?
