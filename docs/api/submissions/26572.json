I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t punched him.", "Oh honey, this is abuse plain and simple, Nta.", "Dump. Him", "NTA. Drop this loser and after you do, take some time to reflect on why you feel that you need to accept this kind of blatant abuse in a relationship. I'm not trying to be mean to you, but in all seriousness.... you have a relationship with someone who actually calls you those names, tells you your face makes him want to be mean to you, tramples your feelings.... and you're confused enough about his actions to have to turn to anonymous people on Reddit because you're honestly wondering if you're the problem. \n\nYou need away from this man and into therapy or some type of serious self reflection to ensure you know you are worth so much more than this.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy are u still with him????", "NTA", "NTA. It sounds like he's testing the waters to see how much you will let him stomp on your boundaries and disrespect you. This is how a lot of abusive relationships start.", "NTA. Please leave him. People like this will never change and they'll blame you or worse when you start getting fed up and responding in kind to their bullying.", "NTA for getting annoyed. \n\nHowever, you are an AH for staying with someone who is so cruel. Why are you with him?\n\nHave you asked him to explain the joke to you, because you're just not getting it. And keep asking until he either backs off or doubles down. If he backs off and apologizes, you may be able to save the relationship. If he doubles down, then, well, he doesn't respect you in any way.\n\nBottom line, if you aren't laughing, then it's straight up bullying and I just can't imagine why you'd stick around for that.", "NTA.  This is appalling.", "NTA. It sounds awful because it IS awful. Only a bully would say \"it is funny when you get angry\".\n\nA joke should leave both parties laughing, When only one laughs, and the other is upset, it is called bullying. \n\nDrop the asshole.", "NTA. This is abuse. It's dehumanising. He takes joy in causing you to feel upset. Read that again, read that again. You are being abused. It's time to end this relationship.", "So a strange solution. May be he wants to dirty talk during sex but doesn\u2019t have the balls, pun intended, so he acting it out during regular hours as a \u201cjoke.\u201d \n\nSounds wild but what if you were to only encourage it during sex and tell him to not say it normally and maybe that will get it out of his system? People are weird like that sometimes. But if you\u2019re not into this type of dirty talk during sex then yeah, it\u2019s time to break it off. \n\nObviously NTA", "Is he Australian?", "That isn't a \"sense of humor\" it's badly disguised abuse and it isn't remotely funny. If that truly IS his sense of humor, you should leave because he's emotionally immature, misogynistic and just plain ICK!", "I would last 5 minutes (maybe less) with a guy like this. Why are you in a relationship with a person who so blatantly & repeatedly disrespects & demeans you?\n\nI don\u2019t even know you, and I am sure you deserve better.", "NTA\n\nPart of me wants to suggest you give him the same treatment.\n\nBut reality is, he isn't willing to admit wrongdoing, so he isn't going to change. He doesn't respect you or your feelings. You deserve better.", "NTA. Does he actually even like you?", "NTA - If it makes you feel bad, it's not a joke, it's harrassment, and it's time to walk away until the guy learns some manners.  When you don't walk away, you give him passive approval to abuse you again.", "Stop telling him with words. Distance your self from\nhim as much ad you can physically. Don\u2019t spend any time with him and just make plans to do things on your own. He\u2019ll stop when he feels you pulling away.", "NTA. If someone I cared about told me I was doing something that hurt their feelings I would stop. He can see that it upsets you and he\u2019s laughing at you! This guy is trash.", "NTA also leave your partner, this is super abusive", "Never, ever, ever associate with people who think it's \"funny\" when you get mad or upset.\n\nWhat they really mean is that they enjoy hurting other people.", "Why the fuck are you putting up with this?", "Right? Who says that to someone they actually care about?! That sentence alone would make me leave.", "Ooooohhh this is a good one. However she would not do it outta fear that he'd get angry & leave her. There's so many of these women who hold onto these awful men outta fear of being alone.", "This is so so funny but definitely don\u2019t do this \ud83d\ude06", "Oh honey, match his energy and see how funny he finds it. NTA.", ">her own fault because she doesn't dress the way he wants her too\n\n\"but honey, you're already my little one minute man as it is. if I dressed any hotter it would be over before it began\".  \n\n\nOP for the remainder of the relationship (hopefully days to weeks max) start calling him your one minute man, your little guy, Mr. Pindick...etc  and then insist it's \"a joke\".", "JFC.. I had to check. \nPlease, OP, run like Forrest and never look back.", "I 100% can confirm what you are saying is truth.  I was also in an abusive relationship with my ex where it started out with yelling & verbal abuse that escalated into physical abuse.  OP needs to run & go no contact.  The sooner the better.", "I think she should just dump him. If he asks why, then she can tell him. He does it because he knows it's not funny and it's abusive.", "Yeah, funny to think about, dangerous to actually put into action. \n\nJust get out now before he starts hitting you.", "\ud83d\ude01 couldn't resist", "This is the way\u2026\nThis relationship.. not so much"]}
