I'm currently studying at a college (I'm not from the US, before anyone asks how I'm in college) that specializes in helping disabled kids with their studies and such. It's been pretty good so far. However, recently I've become more and more uncomfortable with showing up to one of my classes because of the teacher there. \n\nAt the start of the semester, this teacher, let\u2019s call him Mr. M, seemed fine. A little overbearing but I know I just have to suck it up and deal with it sometimes. But right from the beginning we've been running through all the material for this class really fast compared to my other classes and at some point I started zoning out completely while in class because I was confused and uncomfortable. So I did very little during class. Mr. M ended up coming and telling me that I needed to work to be able to pass the class, I told him that I am working and that I just can't focus right now and will do more at home (which is true). I told him I'm autistic and struggle with learning sometimes and just need to clear my head. He told me he understood but that it's not an excuse to slack off, which I wasn't doing. \n\nA few days later I went to my weekly appointment with the schools autism specialist and after a bit of discussion she sent an email on my behalf with some of my boundaries and conditions (medical). One of the boundaries was to leave me alone during class unless I raised my hand as long as I wasn't acting out. It wasn't an issue for any of my teachers besides Mr. M. For the first week after the email went out he left me alone, but after he started bothering me again, asking to see how far I was, what I had done, etc. Nothing to help me whatsoever, just plain bothering me. Then today he did the same thing again, telling me I need to pick up the pace and whatever.  I wasn't going to let it bother me until he stood up infront of the whole class and started talking about how 'some of us' needed to work harder if we wanted to pass the semester. Problem is, he was looking at me until I looked back. He was very obviously targetting me and it was uncomfortable and I kinda wanted to cry right there. \n\nBasically, I'm wondering if I'd be TA if I went and spoke to my autism specialist about this.

He needs to find a different place of employment. Continue to go to your specialist about this, make sure you\u2019re documenting everything as well. Keep a little notebook to write things down in, so you\u2019re able to give as accurate a picture as possible with all incidents accounted for.

Hopefully this is just a blip on the radar for you, but I\u2019d also suggest some coping skills for yourself in dealing with people like this.

I have someone similar to your autism and I think you should definitely talk to her again. \n\nNot only is the teacher disregarding reasonable adjustments that have been asked for (and everyone else has no problem with) he is being incredibly ableist and trying to single you out. He absolutely needs to be reported and dealt with. \n\nI would have an honest conversation with your specialist and explain your concerns. Tell her what he is doing and how he is behaving.

Either way your specialist will work with them to improve the situation, either through educating him or by using the systems in place to enforce regulations. This is their job and they want to help you succeed", "YTA ESH", "YTA ESH", "NTA, but I don\u2019t think your instructor is intentionally trying to be offensive or create problems. I am familiar with this type of \u201chard ass\u201d, they can actually be some of the best professors. He likely wants to push your limits so you can get the coursework down and see what you\u2019re capable of. Usually this type of professor has super difficult exams, and knowing this he wants to push you to be prepared. \n\nWhile it is likely your professor is not intentionally being an AH, he is still in the wrong. It\u2019s good to stand up for your needs and you\u2019re not wrong to do so. But I\u2019d say be gracious in allowing this to be a learning moment for your instructor. If he doesn\u2019t take this opportunity to learn more so he can better serve neurodivergent students, then he\u2019s the AH and deserves to face whatever consequences there may be in store. \n\nAlso, there\u2019s a good chance he is discriminating against your age. That would also make him an AH. Good luck!", "Yeah, for the most part. There are some things I struggle with but I try my best and usually ask her or my parents for help with the things I struggle with.", "OK, so definitely go and speak to your specialist about this (sorry I forget her proper title). \n\nDo you think you'll be OK communicating what has happened to her?", "NTA.  Absolutely, talk to the specialiat.  The college provided you that resource for your wellbeing - use it.", "NTA \n You have the right to education and the support to help you be successful. Always advocate for your needs, autism so misunderstood and misrepresented by the media. \nI worked as support staff in special education for years, and there are accommodations for a reason. Teachers and support staff are expected to follow any of those outlined. Not everyone learns in the same way, under the same conditions, with the same supports and that is why (in most states as far as I know) in the USA we have IEP (individual educational plan). It sets up guidelines for how the individual child learns successfully and what other supports, like breaks, fidgets, shortened or modified assignments, and how to keep behaviors avoiding known triggers.", "NTA. You go to this place to feel comfortable in learning\nYou have your guide to help you if things aren\u2019t okay\nYou have contacted him and asked AGAIN to please go by the boundaries you\u2019ve set in place\nYou definitely need to have this addressed again as he\u2019s not respecting you at all", "Run, don't walk to the specialist. His behavior needs to be reported every single time. YWNBTA!", "NTA, BUT I have a diff recommendation than most so far. I would suggest you and the specialist craft an email together that YOU send. \n\nThese kind of hard ass teachers don\u2019t react well to being told what to do from above, but if you sent something saying you appreciate him checking in on you, and recognize he\u2019s trying to help (bs I know but play to his ego) but you actually end up getting distracted/anxious when teachers interrupt your train of thought. Let him know you feel comfortable proactively asking him for help when you need it, so he doesn\u2019t need to worry about checking in (notice I\u2019m making it sound like you\u2019re doing him a favor). And then maybe close w something you found interesting about class that day and you look forward to blah blah blah (again ego manipulation)", "Okay, thank you for the advice! I'll keep that in mind.", "Nta. \n\nMy thought exactly. Why is he working there? He sounds like a terrible teacher to have, especially in a school geared towards neurodivergent (spelling?) people.", "My specialist usually helps me during our appointed time", "Definitely go talk to her!  It's what she's there for.    \n\n\nDo you think this guy is a jerk or there' s just a mismatch with your communication styles?", "Then that teacher should mind his business and stop pestering you, end of. Talk to the specialist!", "This behavior is almost retaliatory and certainly harassment and creating a hostile environment (but those are US terms for employment law so I\u2019m not sure they apply or not)", "Yea as a parent it's really pissed me off. I'd be quite ready to go to the college and give the lecturer a piece of my mind tbh. \n\nI just want to make sure OP knows what he's covering with the specialist though to get her to address it as I know it can be tricky.", "NTA- ok, I decided you were NTA just at the title.\nAfter reading, NTA, go f' them up baby !\n\nThe great thing about the autism specialist is that, this is their job. If you explain it all fully and clearly, they will know the best way to handle it. If it's a \"suck it up, buttercup\" situation and you just have to deal with it, they can tell you that too (in a much nicer way then that most likely). Just describe the situation to them. Tell them how you're doing in your work outside of class participation, let them guide you in what to do. \n\nAnd great job being a self-advocate, you're doing amazing -Signed, an autistic mom", "Don\u2019t even need to read this to tell you NTA. I did read it but your specialist is there exactly for this reason. Use all your resources and get through the class by making sure the teacher respects your uniqueness. He isn\u2019t having to make special efforts for you, simply leave you alone! Not a hard thing to do. It\u2019s part of your specialists position to communicate to the teachers what you need, if sucks he can\u2019t just get on board but don\u2019t let it beat you. As I say make sure you use the resources provided, you will never be the ass hole for doing that!", "NTA. That\u2019s what your specialist is there for, to help you.", "NTA - I suspect he thinks he's actually helping, ignorance is no excuse though especially after already getting an email.  If he really wanted to help he should reply to the other person asking how he can best do so.   Clearly that isn't going to happen and therefore you need to advocate for yourself in the only way you can.", "NTA. There is help available, he might be not even a bad person, just a bad teacher, so go get that help, it will help you, him, and every other autistic kid he will teach on future.", "[removed]", "NTA and I would say in general you should never feel bad about discussing any teacher's behaviors with your specialist. Remember that the teachers and specialists work together to do what is best for their students, there won\u2019t be any trouble if the teacher isn\u2019t doing anything wrong.", " Let him know you feel comfortable proactively asking him for help when you need it,", "Sorry I'm not sure what you mean?"]}
