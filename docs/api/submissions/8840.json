Mr. M ended up coming and telling me that I needed to work to be able to pass the class, I told him that I am working and that I just can't focus right now and will do more at home (which is true).

Either way your specialist will work with them to improve the situation, either through educating him or by using the systems in place to enforce regulations. This is their job and they want to help you succeed", "YTA ESH", "YTA ESH", "NTA, but I don\u2019t think your instructor is intentionally trying to be offensive or create problems. I am familiar with this type of \u201chard ass\u201d, they can actually be some of the best professors. He likely wants to push your limits so you can get the coursework down and see what you\u2019re capable of. Usually this type of professor has super difficult exams, and knowing this he wants to push you to be prepared. \n\nWhile it is likely your professor is not intentionally being an AH, he is still in the wrong. It\u2019s good to stand up for your needs and you\u2019re not wrong to do so. But I\u2019d say be gracious in allowing this to be a learning moment for your instructor. If he doesn\u2019t take this opportunity to learn more so he can better serve neurodivergent students, then he\u2019s the AH and deserves to face whatever consequences there may be in store. \n\nAlso, there\u2019s a good chance he is discriminating against your age. That would also make him an AH. Good luck!", "Yeah, for the most part. There are some things I struggle with but I try my best and usually ask her or my parents for help with the things I struggle with.", "OK, so definitely go and speak to your specialist about this (sorry I forget her proper title). \n\nDo you think you'll be OK communicating what has happened to her?", "NTA.  Absolutely, talk to the specialiat.  The college provided you that resource for your wellbeing - use it.", "NTA \n You have the right to education and the support to help you be successful. Always advocate for your needs, autism so misunderstood and misrepresented by the media. \nI worked as support staff in special education for years, and there are accommodations for a reason. Teachers and support staff are expected to follow any of those outlined. Not everyone learns in the same way, under the same conditions, with the same supports and that is why (in most states as far as I know) in the USA we have IEP (individual educational plan). It sets up guidelines for how the individual child learns successfully and what other supports, like breaks, fidgets, shortened or modified assignments, and how to keep behaviors avoiding known triggers.", "NTA. You go to this place to feel comfortable in learning\nYou have your guide to help you if things aren\u2019t okay\nYou have contacted him and asked AGAIN to please go by the boundaries you\u2019ve set in place\nYou definitely need to have this addressed again as he\u2019s not respecting you at all", "Run, don't walk to the specialist. His behavior needs to be reported every single time. YWNBTA!", "NTA, BUT I have a diff recommendation than most so far. I would suggest you and the specialist craft an email together that YOU send. \n\nThese kind of hard ass teachers don\u2019t react well to being told what to do from above, but if you sent something saying you appreciate him checking in on you, and recognize he\u2019s trying to help (bs I know but play to his ego) but you actually end up getting distracted/anxious when teachers interrupt your train of thought. Let him know you feel comfortable proactively asking him for help when you need it, so he doesn\u2019t need to worry about checking in (notice I\u2019m making it sound like you\u2019re doing him a favor). And then maybe close w something you found interesting about class that day and you look forward to blah blah blah (again ego manipulation)", "Okay, thank you for the advice! I'll keep that in mind.", "Nta. \n\nMy thought exactly. Why is he working there? He sounds like a terrible teacher to have, especially in a school geared towards neurodivergent (spelling?) people.", "My specialist usually helps me during our appointed time", "Definitely go talk to her!  It's what she's there for.    \n\n\nDo you think this guy is a jerk or there' s just a mismatch with your communication styles?", "Then that teacher should mind his business and stop pestering you, end of. Talk to the specialist!", "This behavior is almost retaliatory and certainly harassment and creating a hostile environment (but those are US terms for employment law so I\u2019m not sure they apply or not)", "Yea as a parent it's really pissed me off. I'd be quite ready to go to the college and give the lecturer a piece of my mind tbh. \n\nI just want to make sure OP knows what he's covering with the specialist though to get her to address it as I know it can be tricky.", "NTA- ok, I decided you were NTA just at the title.\nAfter reading, NTA, go f' them up baby !\n\nThe great thing about the autism specialist is that, this is their job. If you explain it all fully and clearly, they will know the best way to handle it. If it's a \"suck it up, buttercup\" situation and you just have to deal with it, they can tell you that too (in a much nicer way then that most likely). Just describe the situation to them. Tell them how you're doing in your work outside of class participation, let them guide you in what to do. \n\nAnd great job being a self-advocate, you're doing amazing -Signed, an autistic mom", "Don\u2019t even need to read this to tell you NTA. I did read it but your specialist is there exactly for this reason. Use all your resources and get through the class by making sure the teacher respects your uniqueness. He isn\u2019t having to make special efforts for you, simply leave you alone! Not a hard thing to do. It\u2019s part of your specialists position to communicate to the teachers what you need, if sucks he can\u2019t just get on board but don\u2019t let it beat you. As I say make sure you use the resources provided, you will never be the ass hole for doing that!", "NTA. That\u2019s what your specialist is there for, to help you.", "NTA - I suspect he thinks he's actually helping, ignorance is no excuse though especially after already getting an email.  If he really wanted to help he should reply to the other person asking how he can best do so.   Clearly that isn't going to happen and therefore you need to advocate for yourself in the only way you can.", "NTA. There is help available, he might be not even a bad person, just a bad teacher, so go get that help, it will help you, him, and every other autistic kid he will teach on future.", "[removed]", "NTA and I would say in general you should never feel bad about discussing any teacher's behaviors with your specialist.

Since he is the professor for the course, it seems odd that you think differently.", "NTA- You should talk to the specialist. It's likely you aren't the first person he's done this to.", "NTA. Definitely talk to her.", "NTA. If you're where I think you are: education providers have a statutory responsibility to act per the Equality Act and if your teacher is refusing to make reasonable adjustments for a student who had clearly explained their boundaries and needs, to the point he is ignoring requests, he can get in trouble. You approached this informally - it's time to make it formal. People learn in all different ways and it sounds like your teacher is just stuck in his own.", "I was going to say that you would be the asshole, until the last part about him looking right at you. I think it is fair to ask where you are in what is being taught. I don\u2019t think that should be considered bothering. How else would he know where you are with learning. I don\u2019t think that is a fair boundary to have in regards to schooling. You\u2019re saying he didn\u2019t do anything to help you, but what would have helped you?\n\nEdit, forgot to put NTA\n \nA slight suggestion would also maybe having a sit down meeting. Yes, the school is supposed to offer support to people who have different needs, but that\u2019s just it, people don\u2019t have the same needs. One email isn\u2019t going to fix the issue. I think a group meeting could be helpful to explain all sides of it and come up with a plan for you. I think a meeting with your specialist first obviously would be good to prepare for it, but you also seem able to express yourself fine (at least in writing) so maybe having that meeting would help him understand where you\u2019re coming from and help him help you.", "NTA\n\nI mean this in the nicest way possible. Helping you is literally her job. I myself am very nonconfrontational, but people like her have these jobs for this exact reason.", "NTA. the counselor has clearly outlined your needs to your teachers, they need to be respecting them", "NTA - that is what the specialist is there for. Maybe you need to have a meeting with the specialist and the teacher.", "YWNBTA. Mr M was told by a specialist how to deal with your autism. He chose to ignore the specialist and try to make an example of you in class. He needs to be brought up on this and if it keeps happening, you need to keep going to the specialist.", "He's abusing his power.  You need to tell someone ASAP.  This is only hurting you.", "NTA, you\u2019re being targeted and treated unfairly even after your aforementioned restrictions and accommodations. Your teacher is an insensitive AH", "YTA, you want a babysitter not a teacher. \"One of the boundaries was to leave me alone during class unless I raised my hand as long as I wasn't acting out.\" Again babysitting not teaching. \"It wasn't an issue with any of my teachers besides Mr. M.\" How sad for you. I suggest you find another (teacher) willing to ignore you there and leave this man alone. Sounds like there are a lot of babysitters available.", "NTA and you should absolutely talk to your specialist. You have needs and requirements, which have been addressed to him and either he has issues remembering or not, he breached them. Good luck OP", "YWNBTA.\n\nBut phrase it gently - say that you think your teacher needs some help to help you. Then explain what has happened.\n\nThat way it doesn't become an accusation and your specialist can approach the teacher gently too, which is likely to get the teacher to change behaviour.  It's only if this approach does not work that you should pull out the big guns.\n\nGood luck!", "Not only would you not be the AH, you would be the hero in your own success story.  Some teachers put their control issues ahead of their teaching.", "On the contrary, you absolutely should tell her. Mr. M is using terrible judgment and he needs to realize that this isn\u2019t the way to motivate you to do your best. By letting your specialist know, you\u2019ll not only be helping yourself, but helping Mr. M\u2019s future students as well. NTA at all.", "absolutely NTA. this dude shouldn\u2019t be working in a special needs school. reminds me of a teacher i had in elementary school who would yell at me all the time for staring out the window during class, which i couldn\u2019t really control (ADHD and probably autism). \n\ntbh, ALL teachers should be taught methods for educating students with different needs. im so tired of ableist teachers hounding folks with learning disabilities.", "OP is likely the same age as all the other students.", "I am sorry this is happening, OP. Be sure to mention to your autism teacher that \"Mr M\" also said that \"'some of us' needed to work harder if we wanted to pass the semester' while looking at you. Because that is signalling that he is already singling you out for possibly not passing - even though you are keeping up with your work. That suggests he will be assigning biased grades, so be sure you keep copies of your work to enable you to challenge your grades down the road. I've seen that happen loads of times, unfortunately!", "Oh, perhaps I misunderstood. I know they said they weren\u2019t from the US, but I didn\u2019t take that as meaning that they don\u2019t live in the US now.", "I\u2019m gonna go with ESH. Sounds like Mr M really needs to chill. Also, your Autism specialist should have had a private one on one convo with this teacher instead of being passive aggressive. But you for this:\n\n>\tOne of the boundaries was to leave me alone during class unless I raised my hand as long as I wasn\u2019t acting out. \n\nYour a student in his class. He\u2019s be a bad teacher if he just \u201cleft you alone.\u201d Obviously he doesn\u2019t have to berate you, but this:\n\n>\the started bothering me again, asking to see how far I was, what I had done, etc. Nothing to help me whatsoever, just plain bothering me. \n\nA teacher checking on student progress is not \u201cbothering\u201d them. It\u2019s teaching them and trying to be a good teacher. It\u2019s ridiculous if you expect a teacher to not address you in their own classroom.\n\nEdit: Reading this again. Did you ever express any of this to your teacher? Does he know you like to work at home? And what exactly are you doing in class if you aren\u2019t working?", "NTA Mr M is being ableist by assuming you aren't trying hard, rather than genuinely struggling due to your disability. He thinks nagging will make you try harder, realizing you need more help as you are unable to work harder.\n\nMaybe get help laying out points that you are also concerned you are struggling in his class (I think thats obvious but turns out a lot of teachers don't realize.) Say that his approach clearly isn't working, so you need to try other tactics, could someone help advocate/mediate for you to both agree on plans going forward?\n\n It would also provably be useful to mention how much homework you do to try & compensate & any extra specalist help that you get that he will be unaware of & probably assume you arent doing; to gelp get the point across tgat it usnt lazyness & you are willing to put in effort. .  \n\nGetting other staff involved, especially ones that could help explain autism, or at least make him treat you better, is a sensible step. I wish you the best of luck & well done for being proactive.", "NTA. This is what the autism specialist is for. Arrange a meeting to discuss concerns and ask advice. Then take it from there.", "I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re in this situation. You have nothing to be sorry for and you are not an asshole. You are advocating for yourself which can sometimes be hard but you got this! Is this the only teacher who teaches this class?", "NTA.\n\nNothing that happens in a classroom setting can have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  If you want to talk to your specialist about anything that happens in a classroom, please do so.  If the teacher's not doing anything wrong, nothing will happen to them.  If they *are* doing something wrong, your specialist needs to know about it -- that's why they're there.", "NTA.  Considering this college is geared towards helping those that might need extra assistance, this teach sounds like he does not belong there.  Keep complaining when he does this.  They need to see it as a pattern and get him to stop.  He sounds like one of those teachers that think instead of offering help, they can just nag someone into getting their work done which is not functional in that environment.", "Nat, they\u2019re meant to be supporting you in your learning, it\u2019s been documented how best to support you and this should be followed", "I think talking to your specialist is always a good idea. However, I also think you need to realise that a teacher cannot just leave you alone when you are very obviously falling behind. Progress questions about your work are necessary even with students who have special needs. He can't just wait till the end of the year when you fail.\n\nIf your strategy for dealing with this is doing the work at home then you need to do that and then perhaps be proactive and email the teacher where you are up to so he doesn't need to question you. If you are struggling the teacher needs some way to judge where you are at and your specialist should be working with you to develop a system of keeping the teacher informed. Comparing teaching methods from classes you are not struggling in to classes you are is not very helpful. It's easy for a teacher to leave you alone when you are doing the work and understand the material. It's negligent of a teacher to not check in on your progress when you are obviously struggling.\n\nAs for the whole class statement, maybe it was directed just at you or maybe several ppl in the class are struggling. You really don't know nor can you find out. Your specialist can mention to the teacher that this made you uncomfortable but I'm not sure that will do much.", "YWNBTA  - You need help, HE need help to understand how autism affects students.  Do everyone a favor and get Mr M the help he needs", "NTA. You're not an asshole when you politely ask reasonable accomodations to your disability or chronic illness. \n\nFrom one disabled person to the other: learning to advocate for yourself and stand your ground is a necessary skill. I'm very non-confrontational and hate asking people to accomodate me. But if I don't, I'll end up in the hospital. Ultimately, I was forced to learn, and I'm still uncomfortable when I have to ask for help today.\n\nI hope this teacher will see that their attitude towards you isn't beneficial to anyone.", "Yes, hun, you must advocate for yourself! \ud83d\udc9a\n\nNTA", "Do speak to the specialist. Also do some work on the problem yourself in preparation for that conversation.\n\nHe indicates that he believes you aren\u2019t keeping up with the work.  Is that true.  If you are completing assignments on time  doing well on tests, and other markers of progress but you just don\u2019t engage in class discussion, you and he and the specialists may need to establish what it is he is concerned about. \n\nThe school exists to help students like you find solutions to educational blocks.  If he believes a solution for you is to simply work harder and faster, that sounds like something a teacher in a non specialized school would say and do.  Perhaps he doesn\u2019t have training for this type of teaching.  \n\nAsk yourself if he has ever asked you why you are not engaging. If he hasn\u2019t, that is an obvious weakness for a teacher in your school.\n\nHave long thought that the best teacher is a person who had trouble learning a subject, figured out what was in the way, figured out strategies to overcome those, and then earned the subject.  That person then understands how to help a student who is not thriving in lecture style classes. \n\nYou mention the speed of his presentation.  That may be your choke point. It may get in the way of your absorbing the material. It may affect your ability to remember material and link things together.  It may create anxiety which can affect your ability to absorb material.  You may need to ask questions about new material to find the point of relevance that makes it stick.  He apparently delivers material in one way; the way he recognizes as how he learns.  \n\nSo try to think through why his fast pace affects you negatively. If you are not meeting the timeline goals in your class, is it because you aren\u2019t able to do the work at home. If so, why.  Do you have trouble remembering material taught quickly in class and find your textbook confusing?  \n\nTry speaking to classmates to find out if you are the only one having trouble. Find out if any of your classmates are interested in forming a study group to help each other.  If another instructor teaches the subject, see if you can sit in on one of that teacher\u2019s classes to see if there is a big difference.", "NTA\n\nThat is what the specialist is there for, helping students navigate college, classes, professors, the whole lot. If she sends out another message and Mr. M still doesn't seem like they want to change how they interact with you in class maybe have the specialist rope Mr. M's supervisor in on the conversation so they can be alerted to Mr. M's behavior.", "That's similar advice to what I just said, get help writing a letter/email. However, I also know that sometimes teachers like this don't respect students enough to listen, so if the letter doesn't work, then I encourage escelating to involving other staff/ their boss.", "Also, due to the nature of your school you would potentially be helping others.

How is a teacher supposed to know how you are interpreting the coursework? If OP does everything at home, there's not even a guarantee OP is actually the one doing the work.", "Absolutely NTA. Tell on his ass. There is no excuse to single out a student like that under any circumstance and he isn't respecting your accommodations. He is discriminating against you.\n\nI had a teacher somewhat like that. I have modified attendance for my anxiety and sleep disorder and this man literally only read the right hand column of my accommodation letter, which was only the last two out of like 10 items. He told me I only had the last two, so I went to the accessibility office and they highlighted the accommodations and sent it back to him.\n\nMust have bruised his ego, because he did the bare minimum it said, wouldn't help me to catch up on what I missed, and was very passive aggressive to me the rest of the semester to the point I was missing almost every class because I was so anxious and stressed about being in his presence. \n\nHe then set up an appointment with faculty about how he was 'concerned' that I couldn't finish the class with how much I was missing and basically forced me to withdraw. I should have reported exactly what was happening to the office but I didn't and I highly regret letting him get away with it.\n\nDon't let this one get away with it.", "No you wouldn\u2019t be. Yes you should definitely go to your Autism Specialist. When I was in college, my professors bent over backwards helping me when I was going through a rough time in my personal life. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with me other than that. A college designed for the special needs, any teacher there should be more accommodating than a regular university or college. And every one of them did everything within their powers to work with the special needs. And they have a disability department that acts as your Autism Specialist does, only they don\u2019t have specialties. You have as much right to an education as everyone else does. Absolutely go to your Specialist and keep going until you get treated fairly. Also let your parents know what\u2019s going on as well.", "NTA it is the specialist's job to make sure you are treated fairly.

It could be that interacting with Mr. M is sapping OP's energy, leaving him with less to do his work. Additionally, OP says he's doing alright in the class, so it's not like Mr. M is assisting a struggling student.\n\nAs for talking to Mr. M about the things you mentioned in the last part of your post, trouble communicating with NTs is EXTREMELY common for people with autism. In fact, it's one of the diagnostic criteria. NTs tend to misinterpret statements of fact as manipulation and difficulty with eye contact as deception. Not to mention that many autists have social anxiety because of past bad social experiences.

I've heard so many people call the symptoms of autism an \"excuse,\" when they're literally a manifestation of neurological differences.\n\nTalking to an NT, ESPECIALLY an authority figure, isn't as simple as having a conversation. First, there's the anxiety to deal with. A lot of NDs combat this by creating a script and practicing the conversation. This also helps avoid misunderstandings, tho they can still happen if you phrase something wrong without realizing it.\n\nThen when you have the conversation, you have to mask (Not everyone can, as it's an acquired skill. It took me 30 years to figure out and I STILL come off as weird.). A lot of us don't naturally emote, so that means actively making your face, body, and tone resemble the emotion you're trying to convey. If you suck at interpreting social cues (the bane of my existence), you have to use experience and empathy to clinically parse which emotions the other person expects you to feel and their intentions behind their words, and whether or not those words said are in opposition to their intentions, and what that means. And if you're uncomfortable with eye contact, you have to force yourself to make it and guess whether you're being too intense or not giving enough eye contact, all while feeling like you're witnessing something incredibly intimate that you have no right to see and try to hide your discomfort.\n\nIf OP talking to his teacher was an appropriate solution, his autism specialist would have helped him through this process or offered ways to communicate that accommodated him, like working together to write an email. If you think I'm exaggerating, head over to r/autism or even r/aspiememes to see what other autists' experiences are. I promise, we're not using our neurodiversity as an excuse to make NTs' lives harder, our nervous systems and brains are literally developed in such a way that we interact with other people differently.\n\nExample: My NT friends get irritated when I go into detail about my latest special interest and don't pick up on their \"hints\" that they want to discuss something else. A gathering of my ND friends is all of us info dumping at each other and interrupting. If Mr. M is working at a specialized school with ND students, he should be aware that his students interact differently and it's literally his job to accommodate them.", "NTA and you are NEVER the asshole for advocating for yourself. this is a neurotypical world. if you don\u2019t advocate for yourself, nobody will.", "Playing devil's advocate here, the teacher probably sees a lot of students with potential who attempt to slack off due to excuses they can make up based on their disability. Your 'specalist' trying to set a boundary with your teacher that 'he cant talk to you during class' is unrealistic and really depicts the disparagment between the councillor types and the teacher types. And this is probably why these issues occur, but you absolutely shouldn't be the target of this frustration. But also you are more likely to lean into the mollycoddling of the specialist over the tough love of the teacher, but the former might actually be more harmful. I think you should talk to your specalist because the way you were called out was wrong. But going forward you have to revaluate these 'boundaries' and maybe even find a new specialist who is actually going to help you navigate the world around you, not encourage you to always take the easy root. Any 'specalist' who gave you the ok to just mentally afk in class needs the boot. Either you are capable of being in class or you're not, and if you're there you have to participate or atleast attempt to participate in managable steps. Expecting to go to class and make up rules about when your teacher is and isn't allowed to talk to you is ludicrous and is setting yourself up for failure. There is no place in the real world where this would be accommodated, despite how difficult you might find talking to people. You are NTA but if you followed the advice of your specalist forever you probably would end up as the asshole eventually. \n\nYou say you don't have problems in other classes. But if you go into class and do no work and do nothing else and they're ok with that, that basically means they don't care and you actually do have a problem there. Because if you start failing the class work no one will intervene, and you will just fail.  It sounds like you do have problems at school but not the kind of problems you think you do. It sounds like your specialist gave your teachers the ok to just write you off, and they all just went along with it except this one teacher you complain about.", "And without any knowledge of the \"real world\".
