I knew her for a long time, since middle school and we were very close but after her having kids we grown apart a little. We still talk really often though. \n\nShe also has two dogs, and had those dogs for 5 years and I love those dogs and have been around them a lot. They are very sweet dogs and what she did honestly suprised the hell out of me.\n\nShe called me, upset, saying that she had to get rid of her dogs by taking them to the local shelter because after her daughter is born she can't take care of them anymore and that her son has been crying about it because he misses the dogs. I automatically said what the fuck. After a little back and forth I asked her why couldn't she attempt to give away the dogs to someone she knew or a better home and she said It's way too stressful on her. I told her she should feel bad for what she did and what she did should make her feel like a horrible person. She hung up and hasn't spoke to me. \n\nI got a message from our other friend saying I should be more sympathetic, and what I said to her was a bitchy thing to do.

I honestly think that's the least she could have done. Less stressful for the dogs if they're going to someone they know, less shelter time, less risk if it's a kill shelter too. Did she explore other middle grounds like whether you or someone else could take the dogs in for a period of time? \n\nI can't imagine how confusing and upsetting this must be for her child too. It sounds like he was very bonded with the dogs. That's a huge event in the eyes of a young child.\n\nIt sounds like you reacted strongly, but I do think that was a proportionate reaction given the abandonment of two animals she had presumably willingly and freely taken responsibility for. It's probably worth apologising for your tone if you want the friendship to continue, but the sentiment was fair.", "NTA. People need to stop treating their dogs like they\u2019re disposable. Rehome them if you must, but don\u2019t just hand them off to a shelter because you\u2019re too lazy to even attempt. Your friend is horrible and I\u2019m glad you were honest and straight with her. She obviously can\u2019t handle the truth, and I hope she is never allowed to adopt any pet ever again.", "NTA, and I\u2019ve heard that sometimes pregnant people get this impulse to rehome their pets when they\u2019re expecting bc they get this idea they won\u2019t be able to handle taking care of them anymore.\nBut it\u2019s an impulsive thing to do, and terrible to take a dog from a child that young. He\u2019s prob old enough to do the math in his head that new sibling = dog got taken away too", "NTA. I hate when people treat pets that they have had for YEARS as disposable. She could have easily reached out to you and others to see if you could help rehome them. Please try to save those dogs OP!", "NTA\n\nHaving a pet is a privilege and responsibility. If she could not handle the responsibility, she should have handled rehoming them in a more responsible manner. She should have found them a home and not taking them to a shelter. Sure hope she does not get tired of her children.", "NTA. She treated family members as disposable. There is no sympathy for someone like that.", "NTA - I can accept that the dogs plus baby was a combination that couldn\u2019t work for whatever reason. I don\u2019t think rehoming dogs is great but I don\u2019t know her situation. The issue is just taking them to the local shelter. She could have spent at least as much energy asking around as she didn\u2019t talking to people about being sad about it.", "NTA. I disagree with everyone in the comments. A dog is a lifetime commitment. Something you really need to consider before getting one. She couldn\u2019t even do the due diligence to find them the proper home. She just dropped them off at the shelter when they no longer benefited her. She sucks. I\u2019m glad someone was honest with her about her actions.", "NTA. She knew she had dogs before she had kids. She had plenty of time to rehome them if she decided she couldn\u2019t fulfill the commitment she made to them but instead she dumped them at an animal shelter because she was too lazy to find them a decent home herself or even a rescue to surrender them to. I\u2019m a cat person but my husband loves dogs so we have both. Dogs are a pain in the ass compared to cats. We had 2 dogs before we started having kids and ended up having 3 kids. Was it a ton of work having 3 kids and then 2 elderly dogs? Yes.  Was I relieved when they died? Also yes. (Don\u2019t tell my husband; he\u2019s still heartbroken.) But dumping them at an animal shelter should never be an option.", "info- would you have taken the dogs?", "Nta. Dogs aren't accessories. That being said as a former employee  and a volunteer a shelter has tools to help get these dogs rehomed though busom buddies are harder to adopt out or foster out.  Hopefully she at least put some research into which shelter to take them to.", "I would offer to foster the dogs and let her kid play with them but I have no compassion for people who turn dogs into shelters after 5 years. Is there a husband involved in this scenario or just her getting accidently pregnant. I cried when my first cat passed away, yes I was a kid but it is basically your first love.", "INFO:  Did you go to the shelter and try to retrieve the dogs?", "NTA \n\nAnyone who looks at their dogs or pets as placeholders or can't even consider placing them with someone they know is a poor excuse of a human in my eyes. \nWhen we bring home a pet we take an unspoken oath to take care of them all their lives...abandoning them is just plain wrong....\n\nAlso, to me had you not called out your friend, you would have failed yourself ... So don't feel bad about it.", "NTA. Your friend is indeed what you told her she should feel as (not sure if I can repeat it without earning a ban).\n\nBut my question for you is, are you going to try rescuing the dogs from the local shelter? Because if you simply call her names and do nothing about those \"very sweet dogs\" that you \"love\"... you're not really in any higher moral ground.", "NTA  \n\n\nYes, people sometimes do NEED to rehome animals.   \n\n\nEXCEPT they are ultimately responsible for the care and compete lives of living breathing things. Doing the right thing isn't always easy, and there SHOULD be feelings attached to that. I  know plenty of people with LOTS of pets and LOTS of small kids who make it work.   \n\n\nIf your knee jerk reaction was WTF, it was probably accurate.", "NTA if she's so \"overwhelmed\" then why is she having a second kid?  She broke her sons heart because she couldn't manage her life", "NTA - I truly don\u2019t understand how pets become disposable with the arrival of a new baby. If she couldn\u2019t handle them she should have reached out to her network, and done more. Animals are a lifelong commitment, and they shouldn\u2019t have to suffer (nor should the existing son) because of poor family planning on your friend\u2019s part.", "NTA\n\nAnd just in case she DIDN'T know, Owner Surrendered dogs are always euthanized first.", "NTA! When you get a dog, their well-being becomes 100% your responsibility. Rehoming should be a last resort, and even then, dumping them at a shelter is just downright despicable.\n\nFor all the people voting y.t.a in the comments, I genuinely hope you never own a dog.", "NTA. I have friends who did something similar about 12 years ago and our friendship has never been the same since. I was on the Board of a non-profit dog rescue at the time and heavily involved in dog rescue incl. fostering. Before they got pregnant they bought a puppy from a breeder. Had their first child about 2 years later. Then they decided to adopt a second dog so that their first would have a friend - fair enough. They adopted my foster dog. Then they got pregnant again and within 1-2 years of their next child being born decided the dogs were too much work and were annoyed they had to \"come home early when out with the kids to deal with the dogs\". Dog 1 was returned to the breeder at around 5 years old and Dog 2 was returned to the rescue.\n\nI lost all respect for them after that. The adopted dog did have some significant separation anxiety so I can *almost* understand rehoming him between the two and he did go to a lvoely retired couple...but the dog you purposely purchased from a breeder? The dog you wanted SO BAD you couldn't wait until after you had a kid so you could reevaluate your time and ability to care for a dog and a baby/toddler? This was a lovely little dog with a lovely (albeit energetic - they did zero breed researched) personality and they clearly put zero thought into it and then just gave her away like she was nothing.  The adopted dog angered me but given his behavior issues (which they didn't address) I could see why they did it (they were never going to give him the training he desperately needed) but the breeder dog just downright infuriated me. \n\nMore dogs tossed aside when kids come into the picture.", "Yes, YTA. \n\nI know it's a controversial take, but it's okay for people to rehome their pets. If they're no longer able to take care of them -- for any reason at all -- then it's best that they find a new home for that pet *or* return the pet to the shelter if they got the pet from the shelter in the first place. Frankly, I'm even okay with people skipping the \"rehoming\" part and going straight to the shelter part -- people don't have the same resources shelters do when it comes to finding the best homes for pets. A well-run shelter can make sure the people who are adopting the pet are who they say they are, don't have a history of abuse/neglect, and so on.  \n\nIf her home wasn't the right home for that dog anymore -- if she couldn't properly care for the dog anymore -- then what she did was the kindest, most responsible thing she could have done. She didn't neglect it. She didn't keep an animal she was struggling with (increasing the odds of resenting and disliking it) out of fear of other people's judgment. She dump the dog or give it to someone she rustled up on a questionable website. She took it to a shelter. \n\nYou, on the other hand, went off on someone who was struggling, offering them not an ounce of compassion or empathy. Someone you claim to see as a friend. I wonder if she still sees you as a friend -- someone she can trust and turn to in times of trouble. \n\nMeanwhile, as someone who volunteers at a shelter and fosters, I'm just thankful she did the right thing. Many, many people don't, and I see the end results of those awful decisions every day.", "As someone who\u2019s sadly seen dogs who are kept in an unwanted household - it\u2019s not much better/usually worse than a shelter. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for you to judge why she got rid of her dogs, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s truly going on in her house and ultimately in her head. The decision probably wasn\u2019t an easy one for her at all and I am sure she feels like somewhat of a failure but also has an obligation to her own mental well being with a baby on the way. \n\nI do however, think you have a right to question why she gave them directly to the shelter and not rehoused them. Would you have taken the dogs into your home immediately? If so - why don\u2019t you call the shelter and perhaps pick them up. If you don\u2019t want the dogs for whatever reason\u2026 whether your job wouldn\u2019t allow it or current house  or financially or don\u2019t have time for them, etc. maybe you should take a step back and consider she might be thinking the same way. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right to just give your dogs to a shelter, especially after 5 years\u2026 but it\u2019s also not good for a dog to be inside a home that doesn\u2019t want them.", "NTA, your friend is trash.", "NTA. When you take on pet, it\u2019s a commitment for their lifetime, not until you have a kid or it gets inconvenient. Your friend is an asshole.", "NTA. She hasn't even had the baby yet and she somehow already knows that she isn't capable of feeding and occasionally walking the dogs? That's pretty ridiculous. No one is so busy that they can't make a singular social media post to see if any of their friends or family could take in the dogs instead of abandoning their pets of five years. She should be ashamed of herself for choosing to recklessly have another kid if she already couldn't handle her current situation or at the very least find a suitable home for her pets. Hopefully either someone you know can take in those dogs or they get adopted quick.", "NTA. You\u2019re right, and more people need to be told this. A pet is a lifetime responsibility. You should not get them if you don\u2019t plan to keep them, even after having children. They are living, breathing being and are not some handbag you can donate when you don\u2019t feel like using it anymore. If the dogs are not aggressive towards the kids, her reasoning to dump them at a shelter is piss poor. The LEAST she could have done is found a familiar person to give them away to, but she couldn\u2019t even be bothered to do that because of \u201cstress\u201d. Imagine how stressed those dogs are after being dumped like garbage by their owner of five years in a chaotic and unfamiliar environment.", "NTA\n\nFuck your friend - not literally - that is the absolute worst-case scenario for rehoming dogs. Regardless of her stress, demands of parenting, etc. taking dogs to the shelter, especially older ones, is just fuck-witted. Calling her out on it is justified.\n\nWere you able to get the pups from the shelter? I do hope so.\n\nETA - thank you for the gilding you of the Bloody Flowers.", "Nta.  I'd judge her too.  It's too stressul to pick up thr phone or make a facebook post?", "NTA\n\nOk you were not very tactful and you could have given the message with a bit more respect, that's true.\n\nBut you were right. I really don't like dogs and I never want to have dogs (again - I had one as a kid). But still I know the first rule (and that's why I don't want pets): taking a dog means the responsability of really taking him till their death. It's not just like an object to give away. I understand having to give away a dog when a kid is allergic or when one get homeless ore such extreme situations. Absolutely not because of a second baby. She should have found another - and better - solution. Like more help from the father.", "NTA. If she couldn't care for them than she should have found a rescue or a family.  What she did is dump them at a shelter.  The quickest and easiest thing she could do.  She didn't care about the trauma it would cause her son or the dogs. NTA for calling her out for it.", "NTA, she's terrible. Dogs are a commitment, even more so if your kids have bonded with them. What is she teaching her children about caring for things they love?", "NTA\n\nThat sucks for those dogs. She didn't even try to find them homes, she just got rid of them.\n\nAlso why could she have dogs with one child and not the other? It seems pretty wild to just suddenly get rid of your dogs.", "NTA, dogs have feelings and they grieve. Those poor dogs, how on earth could she be so heartless. She had them for 5 years. Will she get rid of her son now too. Dogs are family and she's a massive ah.", "NTA for the sentiment, which I understand, but potentially YTA depending on how much you over-egged the pudding in saying she should feel horrible.", "NTA - She had two living beings under her care, and she just gave them away like nothing. They might even be dead already. The least she could do was try to find them a home.", "NTA. Your friend had many options besides dumping them at a shelter.", "NTA, \nHave you checked with the shelter to see what happened to them? If she would have tried to rehome them to someone in her circle, her and the child could have visited them. All she needed was a social media post or to text some friends and see if anyone knew someone looking to add to their family. That\u2019s easier than driving to the shelter. \n\nUnfortunately shelters are overflowing right now. Dogs are getting put down for ridiculous reasons. At minimum the dogs have been separated as family units are rarely adopted together. Not only did she not find them a home she put them through immense trauma. \n\nPlease check with the shelter and see if they are still there or what happened to them!\n\nYour friend was an AH to her pets and deserved the truth.", "NTA. Horrible thing to do, without attempting another solution. She needed to be called out.", "so they boy lost his pets because he is getting a sister bet he loves his sister now", "You can tell who dosnt have kids in this thread and most likely is anti-kids if they vote NTA.\n\nThe person could have done better for the pets but the mom had to make a choice kids or pets and sorry for pet lovers but kids kinda default win, even though you hate kids, bad parents are worse.\n\nCame back when you are in the situation and have a friend yell at you for the tough choice you had to make.", "NTA. You're right. People who rehome because they have kids are the worst. Didn't they think of that before?", "I\u2019m gonna take the same route as when someone has a family member at their house that they don\u2019t want there.  Anyone that opens their mouth to criticize must also open their door to accept the guests for the infinite period of time. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t open your home to the pets or actively help find a long term solution for then, mind ya business and keep your opinion to yourself.", "NTA- Sounds like she didn't try any other options.", "NTA     Your 'friend' is.  \n\nWho takes a child's pet from them?  What about the poor dogs, who did nothing to have their home ripped from them?  If she cannot afford them, if they are dangerous, if her child is allergic, these are reasons to remove a pet from the home.  How much effort is required to take care of two adult dogs?  I can't imagine a person who is so cold hearted, being a mother.  If her children take too much from her, will she put them up for adoption?  I feel bad for her 'friends' as they could be thrown away with no reason.", "INFO: did you accept one of her dogs?", "NTA at all. We see this shit way too much. Dogs are a life commitment and you don\u2019t just get rid of them when they\u2019re too much. And on top of that not even finding a good home just dumping them at a shelter after 5 YEARS! Honestly OP I don\u2019t think you were enough of an asshole people like this need to know they can\u2019t just dump their responsibility because it\u2019s inconvenient for them now. Those poor dogs. Is there any chance you can take them seen as you know them already and seem like a responsible animal lover?", "Softly, YTA. If she came to you crying, clearly this was not a decision she made lightly. Even if you disagreed with her decision, you could have handled it a heck of a lot more tactfully instead of berating her over it and making her feel worse when she's already upset over it. Do you even know why she surrendered the dogs? Financial stress? No longer having the time or energy to handle two dogs on top of two small children? Pre-partum depression maybe? Did you even ask? As a pet owner myself, I love my dog dearly but if I found myself expecting a child and knew I only had enough resources to care for either the dog or the kid, well... kid would have to come first. But I wouldn't exactly enjoy the decision.\n\nSupport your friend. And if you care enough about the dogs as you say, go adopt them yourself. Or foster them and help find them a good home. But either way, support your friend.", "One, yes, you should be more empathetic.  She loved those dogs too.\n\nSecond, you don't know exactly what she is going through.  Maybe having two kids and two dogs IS too much for her to handle.\n\nOr are you just upset that she didn't ask you to take the dogs?\n\nI volunteer at an animal shelter.  One of the things we are told is that it's not good to rag on people for surrendering their animals.  Often it is the best course of action for their situation.\n\nYTA", "Nta. Can people even read in this comments section. She DIDNT rehome the dogs she left them at a SHELTER. OP is upset not because she had to get rid of them but because she didn't bother to rehome them and instead left them in a shelter.", "YTA. \n\nI can't believe all the people justifying your tantrum at a heavily pregnant woman who seems stressed enough as it is. You sound in love with the damn dogs, so instead of calling your friend horrible, ask which shelter she went to and adopt them. I don't understand how one person can be so willingly obtuse when it comes to emotion.", "Nope, NTA", "YTA. Friend is clearly struggling mentally post having a child. You could have helped find somewhere to rehome them. Instead of doing something useful towards the situation, or even neutral, you've made a bad situation worse.", "YTA. Your friend, who you're supposed to like, tells you she had to make a difficult decision. Possibly an unwise one, or one not in the best interests of her pets. Your response, rather than offer to help, take in the animals, or assist in their rehoming, was to bitch her out and specifically ensure she felt really bad about it. No wonder she hasn't spoken to you.\n\nYour response was unhelpful to your friend, didn't do anything to help the dogs whom you claim to care about, and did nothing except make you feel righteous. Just because you might be right doesn't give you the right to be an AH about it.", "YTA.\n\nYour friend just told you she had to give away her dogs because she's so struggling after giving birth, and you scold her ? Dude, ever heard of PPD ? Couldn't you have a litlle bit of sympathy ? \n\nAre you related to the girl with no heart who thinks her sister is a brat because she didn't enjoy her stay in the hospital ?", "No, you're in the right here. She wanted you to comfort her shitty action and validate her but you are in the right to call out the poor behavior.", "ESH- but with caveats. So\u2026 your friend is clearly feeling super overwhelmed. How\u2019s her pregnancy going? Is she experiencing depression from her pregnancy? Does she have a good support system? Have you offered to watch 4yo so she can take a break? Your post sounds like you\u2019re a \u201cdon\u2019t really like kids, love animals\u201d type person\u2026 did that affect the way you viewed your friend\u2019s problem? My kids come first no matter what so if I\u2019m at a point where I can\u2019t take care of everything you can bet the dogs are going. Not because I don\u2019t love them but because my kids are #1 priority.", "NTA.", "NTA.", "YTA. \n\nSorry, but what business is it of yours to chew her out? She\u2019s putting her kids first after realizing she cannot take care of the dog. I know it\u2019s sacrilege to say on this website, but humans take priority over dogs/pets. She is doing the best she can. She was probably calling you to have a shoulder to cry on/vent, and you attack her. Nice friend.", "YTA\n\nSounds like a stressful decision and as her friend you did nothing but be unnecessarily hate ful\n \n\nShe made a decision based on her family and needs that she wasn't capable of caring for the dogs. That's a hard thing to do but ultimately what's best for the dogs \n\nShe gave them to a shelter. She didn't dump them on a street corner. Get over yourself", "ESH. You should have been more empathetic and your friend should have been a more responsible pet owner. \n\nf you love the dogs as much as you say you do, there's nothing stopping you from going to adopt them yourself.", "YTA - clearly she was distressed about the whole situation. She did what she thought was best for being able to care for her kids and all you did was shit on her. Have some empathy for your friend. Also if you care about those dogs so much find out which shelter they were brought to and adopt them yourself.", "ESH. Your response was harsh to someone who seemed to be upset about her actions, and possibly is extra emotional due to hormones, but I would feel similarly to you. Unless the dogs had attacked her son or shown aggression and training didn\u2019t help, I can\u2019t imagine getting rid of the dogs simply because of a second child on the way. \n\nI\u2019m currently pregnant and have two dogs, and I worry about how challenging it will be with a baby and two dogs. However, these dogs are our family and I can\u2019t imagine getting rid of them - we will make sure they are cared for and hire a trainer if need be to help with the transition with a new baby.", "Atlast she didn't just leave the animals in a random field like most people do. maybe she called you for help and advice instead she was met wht hostility. if you love hte animals so much why don't you care for them? she can't get rid of the kids so the dogs it is, I'm joking.. don't come for me.\n\nNTA but you were mean lol.", "YTA. Your friend is clearly going through some shit and you made it worse. Go get the dogs from the shelter or you're a hypocrite too.", "We don't know if she is on contact with her family. We don't know if she has other friends who could take care of the dogs. For all we know, she was stressed to the hilt having to take care of her current child and the dogs, so now that she's pregnant again she's letting the dogs go so the load is lighter. She's clearly overwhelmed and thought it was easiest to take the dogs to a shelter. So many people in the comments are pretending that having a child can't happen on accident, you pretend people always have the choice to not have another kid. And you're pretending that dogs are in any way comparable to literal human children. So many of the comments on this post are clearly butthurt dog people. This post and so many of the comments are so unnecessarily harsh and gross.", "Tentatively going to say ESH because there isn't that much info on the general situation. It sounds like your friend was upset and overwhelmed, and if that's the case, it's not good for the dogs either to be with someone who can't take care of them properly. I absolutely can't imagine just giving away any pets to a shelter like that, so I think it would have been better to at least ask around in case anyone in her social circle wanted them before jumping to that step. \n\nHowever, if she's been struggling to juggle responsibilities and even that was difficult to handle, some compassion would have gone a long way. Maybe ask more about how she's doing mentally, and if you can actually help. That could be by taking one or both of the dogs yourself, or asking friends and family if they'd be interested. Either way, simply telling her she should feel shitty isn't going to do anyone any good.", "YTA If you feel that strongly about it then YOU go and adopt the dogs. What you said to your friend was out of line. She knows her limits. You owe her an apology.", "NTA\n\nshe had plenty of time to rehome the dogs, especially to someome she knows and can care for them, what if she gave away the dogs to a shelter that will kill them? Your friend is heartless.", "YTA. I think you could have expressed your concerns more kindly. If this kind of thing is out of character for her, I\u2019m wondering if she is suffering from PPD or has some other issues going on.", "YTA. Want the dogs so bad? Go to the shelter and get them yourself. You sound like a horrible friend. \n\nGiving away an animal you know you cannot take care of is NOT selfish, it is selfless. Her keeping them only to not have enough to care for them, her children or herself would be selfish. At least this way her dogs can find more capable homes. She's lucky she now knows she can't count on you for support. You sound insufferable.", "YTA. If you can\u2019t take care of pets, they should be rehomed. It would be cruel to keep them and neglect them. Children come before pets, and by that, I mean care of children comes before pets. If we only have the ability to care for the children, it is ethically responsible to allow someone else to care for the pets. We don\u2019t always know what we can handle before it happens. She is doing the mature thing by giving them up.", "NTA\n\nShe's a bad person and should feel bad.  Poor dogs.", "ESH\n\nIt makes me so sad to read about those two dogs, because chances are they will not find new homes together and being separated from each other is another trauma, in addition to being separated from the family they know. \n\nI am disappointed in your friend. Pets should not be disposable, and yet people surrender them to shelters all the time. I had a coworker who surrendered his cat to the shelter when it got old and needed medical care he didn't want to pay for. He said \"maybe someone else will adopt it and pay for its care.\" Unlikely. That cat was probably put to sleep and he knew it. On the other hand, I have adopted the pets who needed medical care, so maybe that cat got lucky. But the odds are against them. \n\nI think YTA too, OP. If all you are going to do about the situation is shake your finger and lecture your friend, that's completely useless. That's not going to help those poor dogs who are down at the shelter. That's just going to make you feel morally superior when you shouldn't. If you REALLY wanted to do the right thing, you would go adopt those dogs. So I feel like ESH. Your friend felt like she couldn't care for her furbabies and gave them up so now they are alone in a cage. OP is unwilling to do anything other than deliver a lecture, which does nothing to help the dogs.

She seems to really love those dogs if she\u2019s crying about missing them and freaking out that they\u2019re gone, I would be more concerned by this decision than angry.

Maybe she really isn't capable of caring for the dogs anymore.

I know when I have kids it's going to be an adjustment. Now I say this playfully, but I'm just as likely to give my kid up for adoption as I am my dogs. Catch my drift? IT AIN'T HAPPENING. THEY ARE FAMILY. She had so many options. Doggy day care to tire them out, proper training, asking family or friends for help... She sucks. I hope you can get those dogs adopted together and find them a home together. It absolutely is not you problem or burden but I'd be very tempted to do that if the shelter wasn't fucking amazing.

That kid just lost his siblings.\n\nAnd before people come at me saying I don't know how hard kids are, I teach third grade (taught 1-3 for more than a decade) and cared for my terminally ill mom for two and a half years before she died. And my dad, who had brain surgery and has parkinson's. And I struggle with ADHD, depression, and anxiety, and obviously after my mom died, grief too. All with three dogs. When there's a will, there's a way. Rehoming is sometimes the right choice, but from the information given, this was just dumping at a shelter. We don't know if this shelter is good or has a no kill policy. Those poor, traumatized dogs may be euthanized or sent home without each other.\n\nQuickly ETA: OK, I reacted quickly with high emotions. My opinion hasn't changed, but obviously every situation has nuances. if this lady is struggling with PPD, and making completely fucked up decisions due to hormones and such, where the fuck is her partner? Are they helping her? Does she know she has support? I'm thinking about this more, and I'm wondering why the heck she hasn't asked for more help. I'm a pro-therapy, pro-find support gal. Is this the first time you've ever reacted like this to her? Are you typically a safe space for her? If so, she should have come to you. If not... Well, maybe more safe spaces was what she needs.

If that were the case, then the friend\u2019s son (who obviously loved the dogs) could have visited them and continued to play with them.\n\nThe reality is that most animal shelters are kill shelters, which means that animals are euthanized if they don\u2019t get adopted within a certain amount of time, in order to make room for more animals.  Even no-kill shelters are usually not a great place to live, especially for pets who are used to living in a loving home.  Imagine this\u2014being confined to a metal cage, with the sounds of strange dogs barking all the time (and the smells of many strange dogs), only going outside for a 10-minute walk twice a day.  Many dogs are so stressed in a shelter environment that they have horrible diarrhea (have seen that first hand).\n\nUnfortunately, friend\u2019s dogs may not be very adoptable, depending on their breed, as well as the fact that they are older (many people want puppies).  The dogs may end up having bad separation anxiety, which may result in them being relinquished to the shelter even if they do get adopted, or, at worst, euthanized by their new guardians (behavior problems are a leading cause of pet euthanasia).\n\nWithout mincing words, what friend did was vile and irresponsible.", "YTA.

I wanted to accept, my  husband was against it.  We had an already senior cat starting to have health issues, and we had two young large hunting breed dogs, he was afraid it was too much and unsure how they would react to a much younger/faster still kitten stages and didn't want to be responsible for them harming it and the extra work it would bring.   I relented to his no, mom returned the cat.\n\nI waited about a month and went into the shelter, seeing if she would have been adopted, she is a very pretty cat, but she was still there, it broke me as I had bonded with her, I adopted her and decided to deal with the fallout at home, but I DID call him first and though he was against it, didn't flat out say NO.\n\nI did a very drawn out introduction period with the dogs and older cat, over several weeks, and the calico stayed mainly in my sons room and the litter box/food was gated from the other pets.  I put in the time, effort with patience and it was a smashing success.  The older cat and her tolerated eachother and with time became friendly, but the dogs and her became SUPER tight, she's one of the 'pack' with the dogs, even sleeps ONTOP of them, they hunt critters in the yard together, follow each other and very bonded.  I was upset with my mom for giving up on her, but the end result was she's a much happier cat, she needs a lot of interaction, which she didn't get enough with my elderly mother, but gets PLENTY of in this crazy household lol.  To moms credit, she did try with us first before taking her back, so I kind of feel at fault for not attempting it first like I did a month later to see how it would go.\n\nMy moms loneliness led her to marry a guy to soon, which she know says she should have just kept the cat LOL.", "I think it may say something about friend\u2019s level of desperation that she was unwilling to make any effort to re-home the dogs.

If it were not for rescues in the urban areas willing to transport dogs and cats from the rural areas, the nationwide kill rates would be so much higher.\n\nWhen you adopt an animal, you are making a commitment for the life of that animal. Surrendering the pet should be the very last choice.", "The shelter near me has a Pet Pantry where needy people can come in and get free food, leashes, supplies, etc.  I know they are not the only one. If people are struggling to feed themselves and their pets, there is help out there.", "Can't fathom how people do stuff like that. But yes, absolutely agree with you.", "Don't have kids you can't handle if you already have a family you're struggling to manage. No one needs this lady to have more children, especially is she's making willy nilly choices like this for animals she's owned 5 years. This is sick.", "This is reddit, where dogs > humans. Imagine actually choosing to not to create a family because you have a dog.", "Again, you don\u2019t know what this woman is going through, and she sounds as if she\u2019s going though some serious mental health struggles. She has had these dogs for years and she felt forced to give them up. I doubt she\u2019s proud of that. \n\nAlso, all shelter shaming does is encourage people to drop animals off in a box somewhere. Hopefully the dogs can be adopted out and find a better home.", "That\u2019s also a fair point. Perhaps my judgment is more ESH, because I don\u2019t agree with what the woman did. I guess I just know what it\u2019s like to bite off much more than you can chew when it comes to animals and children (on a much much smaller scale) and I\u2019m lucky enough to have had these experiences to know better before I have kids of my own. In her position I would feel immense shame for not being able to take care of all of these beautiful creatures at once (also is the baby daddy involved at all?) and being told by my friend I was a fuck up wouldn\u2019t really help me grow as a person, it would make me hate myself more.", "That is a very good point. I misread that part.  Still, I don\u2019t see why shitting on her does any good. Maybe she is dealing with some other type of depression or is feeling overwhelmed. \n\nI would think they would have to be a pretty compelling reason for her to suddenly abandon her dogs, to whom she would\u2019ve felt some attachment herself. \n\nOP didn\u2019t bother asking her friend why she gave up the dogs or if she was going through anything. Just started shitting on her.", "I think telling someone they should feel like a horrible person it\u2019s just as bad if not worse than calling names. It carries more weight actually; it\u2019s calling their entire character into question.\n\nI also happen to disagree with you. You have no sympathy for the fact that she was overwhelmed and could not handle the dogs. Maybe she was going through PPD.  \n\nFrom the dogs\u2019 standpoint, they are going to feel separation grief whether they go into another home immediately or if they go to the shelter first. There is an excellent chance that they can still go into loving home; because many people adopt dogs from rescue shelters.\n\nTelling someone they should feel like a horrible person doesn\u2019t help anyone except the OP pat themselves on the back for being an asshole virtue signaler.", "Pretty hilarious in the current political climate to say being a parent is always a choice.", "You\u2019re absolutely right that being a  parent is no excuse for being a shitty person, but I will note that we absolutely did NOT have even the most remote idea what we were signing up for before we had a kid. Even the ones that think they do\u2026don\u2019t. 100% unfathomable until you\u2019re in it. \n\nThat being said, OP\u2019s friend **did** know that having a second kid wasn\u2019t going to make life -easier- and is absolutely an AH for not putting in the effort of making better arrangements for those dogs. And being far enough along to know it\u2019s a girl? That\u2019s usually at the 18-20 week point.

It sounds like she needs help and hopefully she will get it.", "We literally have no information on the area or the breeds of the dogs. Making the comment that the dogs have likely been put down is absolutely hyperbole. \n\nYour comment simply puts you at the forefront of the pitchfork bearing mob. \n\nAlso, my original question still stands: Why did the OP just dump on the friend rather than inquire about where the dogs are and make moves to retrieve them??", "Exactly. She managed to call her friend up to look for sympathy but not to see if she could take them or help find someone who could.", "It's a guess, but I suppose that's all we can do, but if she's completely overwhelmed and dreading losing her dogs, then perhaps she couldn't manage to call around -- it was just too much for her?\n\nWhen we're okay we imagine we'll always have the strength and energy to do the right thing and the things we know we should do, but when we're in the situation it can feel impossible. That's why friendship is about supporting people when they can't cope, not calling them names.", "you're right, I'm sure your friend the serial shelter employee knows how all shelters work worldwide. none of them can be bad, because happywhateverday's friend worked there and said so!", "I also don\u2019t love that she called OP apparently for absolution or validation. What was she expecting to hear? \u201cOh you did everything you could, this is the best choice for you and your family, your children come first\u201d? Probably.", "People also don't realize that no-kill shelters also have to euthanize some animals for behavioral issues. Dogs or cats that are aggressive or excessively anxious in a shelter may be euthanized because they're unadoptable. Some of these animals can be fostered and helped but there is also a shortage of foster homes. \n\nPets who have lived their whole lives in a home and then get dumped into the chaotic shelter environment tend not to do well.", "Well, I\u2019m still grateful for my shelter cat snuggled up against as I type.", "people are acting like she shot the dogs in the street or something\u2026 she literally dropped them at a shelter. they\u2019ll \u2018bond\u2019 with the next person that feeds them.", "I don't know -  it's true, we only know what OP has shared. I do know she could have done the right thing (under the circumstances) and at least posted in local groups or even asked friends if they would be willing to give the dogs a loving home. I'm concerned she's bringing yet another life into the world with challenging and fragile mental health, that to me, is extra sad. \n\nShelters should be the ultimate last, very last choice, and it's not meant as a shame - it's a shame that people don't do the right thing, at the least, the very minimum thing to care for animals they've had 5+ years, longer than her first son, since she got them while she was pregnant. \n\nAgain, going off the facts laid out here, I hope OP's friend is OK, but I don't give pregnant ladies a pass for doing totally AH things, which in this case, they've done here. I hope for the sake of those kids she's able to get the mental healthcare she needs to care for them, or the resources she needs, etc. I have a TON of empathy for people in difficult situations but not those that try nothing before resulting in doing pretty horrible behavior, and then expecting OP to condone it or not call it out? Nah...", ">(also is the baby daddy involved at all?) \n\nThis is a great point. We haven't heard what the partner thinks/feels or how involved they are! I would love to know. \n\nAnd agreed about the ROI on telling the friend they were a fuck up - you don't want to make their mental health worse, but it would be hard to let this slide too - this just seems totally avoidable.", "OP did ask. They had some back and forth and OP asked why she couldn\u2019t responsibly rehome them. And anyway, she had already provided her reasoning that she didn\u2019t feel able to care for two dogs, a young child and a newborn. That is a compelling reason for rehoming - it\u2019s not a compelling reason for shelter-dumping. Stress or whatever doesn\u2019t absolve you from making irresponsible, potentially deadly, decisions about your dependents. \n\nI\u2019m not generally pro-shitting-on-her, but I\u2019d have a really hard time holding my tongue here too.", "Of course telling someone they should feel that way is negative. That's the intent. But doing so when you're right and it's justified doesn't make you an AH. The woman is indeed that for what she did to her dogs. Telling her so is just calling her out. \n\nI don't have any sympathy for the woman, no. For one, it's not PPD, she hasn't given birth yet, and her older son is 4. I don't feel any sympathy for someone who took over the responsibility of looking after sentient beings and then bailed, in general. But if she had any kind of reasonable excuse for not being able to care for her dogs (which she got at the very least a few months before having her first child), then she had plenty of other responsible and loving ways of solving this than dumping them in a shelter. Being pregnant or being a mother are not blanket reasons to act like shit toward your companion animals. I'm a mother, and I do not condone that. Taking an animal as your companion is a huge responsibility and it's for the lifetime of that animal or yours (whichever ends first, usually it's the animal's). \n\nThe dogs would indeed suffer a trauma from being rehomed, hence why it should've been done responsibly if at all: finding a suitable family and doing the adaptation from previous home to new slowly, allowing the dogs to familiarize with the new environment and people, keeping contact with the previous owner for a while. All things the woman apparently found \"too stressful\" to do for the animals that accompanied her for five years. \n\nWhen someone comes crying about how upset they are that they abandoned their dogs and that their son, who has known them since birth probably, cries and misses them, they are acting as if they're the victim. Well no. You won't get that from me. I'd be sympathetic if you ask for advice or help about what to do with your dogs if you're feeling \"overwhelmed\". I'd certainly help you rehome them if it comes to that (although it should be a last resort). But come to me with that victim act and you'll get a call out. \n\nThe dogs are the victims here. Not the woman.", "Yes the current political climate sucks but she still made choices", "Of course not but that doesn't change the fact that she's irresponsible and she hurt her son.", "If she gets overwhelmed again in five years because she had two kids she chose to have, should she drop them off at an orphanage, or should she contact a family member or family friend to see if they could take the kids?", "Lol, I'm just pointing out that they said MOST shelters are bad. I'm not claiming MOST shelters are great, either. \n\nMaybe we just shouldn't be making blanket statements about things with no evidence, eh?", "Exactly. She even cried about her son being sad and missing the dogs... as if OP should be more sympathetic about her for having to deal with that... than about the poor child who just lost his two family members overnight?! \n\nShe was victimizing herself, and continues to do so since she is now going to other friends to tell them about how OP was mean to her.", "She felt shitty and she called her friend, but to claim it was for validation is insane because we don't know either of them, maybe they literally call each other up every single time they're sad about something just to have someone to listen. \n\nWe start inventing our own narrative to claim to know why she shared the story with her friend and get way off topic and just end up shitting on people whose motives we couldn't possibly understand.", "You can be grateful for your shelter cat while simultaneously being irate at the path he had to take to get to you. They're not mutually exclusive. \n\nAll my pets are rescues, brought to a big city in the midatlantic from rural shelters in Florida, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. I'm glad each one of them ended up with me but that doesn't make the people who abandonned them (and in some cases, this is literal, like people who moved and just left their dog behind in the empty house) any less of a bunch of assholes.", "I also have a cat on my lap as I type. She\u2019s the best, I\u2019ve had her over ten years now and I love her so much. \n\nShe had been dumped outside and was emaciated, scared and heavily pregnant when I found her. Much as I\u2019m grateful for her, I\u2019m not grateful that someone dumped her outside like that.", "This is an awful choice. A shelter could be horrible for dogs who've bonded to a family  FIVE years. How long did she try to simply ask friends and family to take the dogs? It's clear she didn't try ANYTHING. So lazy. So sad. So sad for their kids if their mother can't handle this very basic responsibility. No more kids is def a great option for this person.", "Nothing in the post suggests that she asked her friend about her mental or emotional state.  Dropping them off at a shelter is the first step in the process of rehoming them. \n\nDid OP go to the shelter to see if the dogs were still there? Of course not.  She\u2019s just a virtue-signaling AH.", "How does calling her a horrible person help the dogs?", "Once again, there are facts we don't know. Does she even have family willing to take the kids?? If she does have family willing to take the kids, is that a good placement for the kids?? \n\nEveryone wants this to be black and white. It's not. There is more gray here.", ">Maybe we just shouldn't be making blanket statements about things with no evidence, eh?\n\nStarting by you and your shelter connoisseur friend, you mean?", "Then why not call OP before giving them up if she were so sad about that? \n\nOf course the call was for validation. What else would it be for?\n\nAnd it\u2019s okay to call someone for validation if you\u2019re going through a bad time and want to talk to someone. I don\u2019t mean that it was a calculated attempt at validation, but that\u2019s why we reach out to people when we\u2019re upset. We want someone to vent to, to make us feel better, to tell us we\u2019re doing good. \n\nBut this person dumped a heavy load on OP. I do think she could have been more diplomatic in how she communicated her disappointment in her friend, but I too would have struggled to put a positive spin on that or even respond neutrally.", "Yep. My dog had just turned 2 when I adopted him out of his 4th shelter. He was transferred to my city from a kill shelter in the south a week before he was due to be euthanized. Wasn't neutered until he got here. Had no training. His last return report said it was due to \"behavioral issues\" and he had an untreated and badly healed hip fracture, double ear infections in both ears, and a skin infection. \n\nHis chances of adoption were so small with all of that going on. \n\nLuckily we locked eyes when I was walking through the kennels and I was just crazy enough to choose him because I knew I had the ability to take care of his medical needs and train him. \n\nI think a lot about how if the first person who adopted him as a puppy, or the second person, or the third, was like me, he would've had a better life of love and care and wouldn't have had to go through all the stress and pain he did before he got to me.", "they\u2019re literally just dogs. they\u2019re animals. quit anthropomorphizing them", "The friend had already explained her mental state. \n\nDropping a dog off at a shelter is the LAST option for rehoming. Most open-intake shelters are not no-kill shelters (they can\u2019t be, because their resources are finite and cannot cope with the volume of drop-offs.) When you drop off anything but a well-behaved puppy or purebred, there\u2019s a very real chance that dog will spend a stressful week in a cage and then be euthanized. There are many other options. They don\u2019t always work out, but she didn\u2019t even try. \n\nWhy would you expect OP to go to the shelter for them? If OP wants dogs, presumably she already has them. If she doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t want dogs or knows she can\u2019t be responsible for one. If I took in every animal I heard about someone dumping, I would have thousands of animals. It\u2019s not realistic at all. \n\nOP is not virtue-signalling, she\u2019s reacting to a real situation involving people and dogs she knows.", "It didn't, as far as we know. Hence why I asked if OP would try to find them.\n\nBut OP didn't ask if they were an AH for finding/not finding the dogs. OP asked if they were an AH for telling the friend what they told. And my vote is no, they are NTA. If they want to help the dogs, though, then they need to do more than that.\n\nThe friend is a huge AH for abandoning her dogs. And exactly what OP called her.\n\nP.S: if the friend had any redeeming qualities, being called out would've led her to try and get her dogs back, even if only to properly rehome them. However, since so far her actions have been more about going to other people in her social circle to victimize herself over what OP told her, that is unlikely to happen. Further proving she's just an AH. \n\nWhile we are at it, that woman just ripped two family members off her son's life and taught him that it's ok to abandon animals if you feel they're too much for you to handle at any given time. Hell, even taught him it's ok to abandon anyone you love if they become a nuisance to you. \n\nThere is nothing redeemable in her actions.

And came here to add that the mere fact that someone says they worked at a number of shelters in the city and claims they're all great doesn't mean that they actually are great.
