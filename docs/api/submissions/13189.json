My husband and I discussed all of that in the \u201choneymoon\u201d phase when we were planning our future together, and we communicate/compromise on stuff we don\u2019t 100% agree on. There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting a boy to be chivalrous if that\u2019s what you both want, there\u2019s also nothing wrong with teaching gender equality if that\u2019s what both parents want. But having two opposing views from both parents is going to leave that boy confused or at odds with one parent and that\u2019s not fair to him.", "And\u2026 I thought it actually was illegal for someone under the age of 14 to pump gas? I know my Dad got quizzed about this once day whenI was doing it at 12yo. Check your State laws.", "Why can't she cook?", "Lmao tell that to my wife. No way I\u2019d make her do that stuff. Come on, man!", "If that\u2019s your choice by all means go ahead. You do you. *My* fianc\u00e9e on the other hand likes to do it herself. Only time I do it is if I take her car and it needs to be done. \n\nMy, and plenty of other peoples point, is that it\u2019s sexist and wrong to teach him to expect to do that just because he\u2019s male. I\u2019m pretty sure that, like me, you grew up being told that was the case. \n\nNo different than teaching a girl to cook or to do laundry or household chores because a man expects it.", "My daughter loves cooking and baking though \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. \n\nDamned if you, damned if you don\u2019t. \n\nPlus, my wife always likes having our son around me whenever I do household projects/fixes around the house.", "I open doors for other people, because it's the polite thing to do. Doesn't have to be gendered.", ">\tMy daughter loves cooking and baking though \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.\n\nThat\u2019s fine. If she likes it and chooses to do it then more power to her. In the same vein form what I said before, there\u2019s nothing wrong with falling in a traditional gender role if you like doing it. There\u2019s a difference a stay at home mom that mutually came to a decision with her partner than one that was expected to do so with no input from her and/or ignoring her feelings. \n\n>\tDamned if you, damned if you don\u2019t.\n\nI mean that\u2019s just life. You can\u2019t please everybody. There\u2019s people out there who\u2019ll assume your daughter is being forced to cook and bake because she\u2019s a girl and (ironically) tell her that she should stop doing it. \n\n>\tPlus, my wife always likes having our son around me whenever I do household projects/fixes around the house.\n\nSlightly disagree with that, but, at the end of the day it\u2019s your family and your life man. If you\u2019re happy and everyone else is happy, then no worries.", ">No way would she ever have even mildly resisted or objected.\n\nWhat a creepy sentence to write about your own daughter, are you on some kind of watch list?", "Yeah nothing to be confused about with that one it's just another of the \"women are weak, delicate flowers\" kinda thing so obviously standing is just way too hard on them as opposed to the big strong man who can handle the pain of (checks notes quick) standing. Lol."]}
