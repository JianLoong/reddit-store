I presumed she was picking him up from after school activities and just stopped for gas. I got home before they did and it took them another 25 minutes. When they got home, I asked what kept them and my wife said that she had him air up her tires. She then said that I need to start teaching them that if he's in the car with a lady, he should be the one gassing up her car and airing her tires for her, not her.\n\nI was extremely bothered by this. For reasons I'll elaborate on later, I explicitly did not tell him this. I ask him if he wanted to air up her tires and she said she had to tell him to do so. I explained to her that, I did not tell him that he \\*needed\\* to fill up anyone's car except for his own. She said that I'm teaching him wrong and that as a man he will be filling up women's cars for them. I said he is not obligated to do that simply by virtue of being male. I told her that I told our son that he did not \\*have\\* to do anything for any woman just because he's male and I've explained this to him regarding multiple topics. I told my wife I didn't want to reinforce certain ideas of masculinity and that she should not do that to our son. I told her that these ideas harm our son and reinforce a bad way of thinking in is young mind regarding women.\n\nShe did not take kindly to my reprimanding and said I was trying to make her into a bad guy for teaching our son chivalry.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679781789, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1220t9m/aita_for_reprimanding_my_wife_and_telling_her/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Respectfully, your wife is sexist.\n\nWhere I live, we don't pump the gas ourselves or put air in out tires ourselves, there are attendants at the stations who do this, but whenever I am in a car with my boyfriend, he is the one to step out and watch over. And it isn't because he HAS to, because he doesn't HAVE TO, it is because he wants to. \n\nWhich is what you are teaching your son and your wife should actually appreciate that. He doesn't have to do anything like you mentioned in the post, he should do it IF he WANTS to do it.", "NTA your wife is being ridiculous.  I am a woman and find it so infuriating when people seem bewildered that I can change my own oil or mow the lawn or carry an object over 5 lbs. or any other \u201cman job\u201d.  Women who actively try to uphold patriarchal standards are the worst.", "NTA.  Your son can opt to do that for a gf or wife in the future but no it\u2019s not expected.  Sometimes my husband takes my car to fill it up since he is going out, but I don\u2019t expect him to.", "NTA. You're quite right about this. I had parents that had a very similar mindset. Except honestly my mom just wanted an excuse to make us do everything for her more than wanting to teach us anything. It had a large impact on my relationships until I was able to fully unlearn these toxic traits and made friends with many women who shared their side of those experiences with me.\n\nHonestly the worst part of what your wife is teaching your son is that he should expect to do everything in the relationship and take care of his significant other more like a dependent than a partner.", "NTA. You are exactly right. Your son should not be expected to do these things merely because he is a male. That is just ridiculous and good for you for standing up for him.", "NTA. I\u2019m female, and I disagree with your wife\u2019s attitude. I find it as repulsive as a father saying his daughter shouldn\u2019t learn these basics because she will have a man to do it for her. Instruct your son that tasks aren\u2019t regulated by gender.", "NTA. This isn't chivalry, this is unpaid labor and sexism. She is using her son to avoid doing this and excusing it as teaching him something. She is sexist as fuck.", "NTA- but your wife is. Chivalry is NOT requiring someone to offer help. Chivalry is offering help when you want to. She is trying to teach him that women need help and if he tries this with some women he will get called all sorts of things and loose friends.(and dates)", "NTA; chivalry should not be forced. \n\nAnd as well, was there even any reason to add air to her tires? If the tire pressure was fine, then there was no reason to add air.", "NTA. I mean asking him if he wants to fill the gas tank that takes less than 5 minutes to do is one thing, but demanding, not asking, tire pressure to get checked as well is another. Hopefully it was at least nice weather out for him. If you had a daughter would she have done the same thing to her?", "NTA. Regardless of Gender, everyone should know how to pump gas, air tires up. I don't care if you are in a full service state, you need to know how so if you leave the state you don't look stupid.\n\nAlso! Screw that whole \"a lady doesn't air her own tires up or pump her own gas\" notion! its 2023 we can do it ourselves, now if you don't know how, ask, and if you are physically unable to? Then yes hopefully you got someone whos kind enough to help. But if your able to do it on your own then do it on your own. \n\nI was born a woman, and I know how to do that stuff and I do NOT expect no one else to do it for me, (at least not the air. Cause I'm in a state where its actually illegal for me to pump my own gas. because people are stupid and have damaged pumps before. I've seen it happen. so if  a cop felt like it when they saw me pumping my own gas me and the store could be fined) unless I am physically unable to do it. \n\nShe needs to fix her way of thinking cause that ain't right.", "NTA.

She is wrong.", "*My son is 12 and recently I started showing him typical car maintenance, simple stuff, changing tires, putting air in tires, refilling wiper fluid, gassing up the car etc.* \n\nYet it's a crime for your son to gas up the car and fill the tires with air for his mom. Whether he's doing this for himself or a date, his ego will survive. YTA.", "NTA I never knew you pump gas with the penis - or why should the man do it?", "NTA", "NTA.  Your wife's ideas are old fashioned.  I'd rather be asked if I want my boyfriend to pump gas or put air in my tires.  I'm a girl but I can do that shit for myself.  I can't tell you how many times I've had a guy come up to me and tell me that I don't know what I'm doing when it comes to basic car maintenance.  The funniest one was when a dude told me that and then I had to teach *him* how to properly connect jumper cables to his car.\n\nHaving a guy say they are going to do that makes it seem like they think we are stupid and don't know basic car maintenance.  If your son does that to his future girlfriend she's probably going to be insulted.", "NTA. As a woman I appreciate you teaching your son to be self-sufficient and to expect women to be capable of self-sufficiency as well. \n\n A lot of the \u201crules\u201d about how a gentleman treats a lady are based on a time period where women were considered incapable of most things. To be fair, the clothing truly did inhibit mobility, but few people are wandering around in corsets and hoop skirts nowadays.  \n\nI think it\u2019s a great idea to teach kids/everyone to *consider* offering to help people with things like gas or tires, especially if they might have a harder time doing it for themselves. I think that\u2019s a natural outcome of your approach. I think your wife\u2019s approach is going to lead to resentment, frustration and awkward relationships with girls/women.", "Your wife is trying to raise your son to be a gentleman. You are trying to raise your son to be an incel.\n\nYTA.", "YTA, it sounds like you just want to be right.", "YTA, I fully expect my husband, dad, and brothers to put air in my tires if they are in the car with me. You want me bent over and sometimes squatting with my ass towards the street pumping air in tires in sometimes sketchy neighborhoods. It\u2019s a safety issue, not sexism.", "YTA \n\nNot for your opinion, honestly I agree but undermining your wife\u2019s authority is right on the road to divorce town. How would you feel if you told your kid to wash dishes and then she came up after you and said \u201cno you don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d And told him to stop. Yeah.
