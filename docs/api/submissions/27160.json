After what felt like an eternity I got pregnant. We were trying and not succeeding and his family knew that. I cried a lot about it and skipped out on things because I got really depressed because it was not happening. (I have an ovulation issue and have been told it would be almost impossible to get pregnant). My husbands oldest sister named her child after my husband(first name) and now his youngest sister who got pregnant unintentionally wants to use the other name(middle name). I have made it clear that I was going to use the name. The oldest sister doesn't understand why I am upset as it a \"family name\". My husband is the only one in the family with that name. My husbands oldest sister also named her first child after their dad who has family name it goes back at least 4 generations that I know of. I do not feel my husbands name is a \"family name\" I think that family names go back generations your sibling is not generations. I also am upset that my husbands mom told me I was stealing the youngest daughters thunder as she is due a few days before me. (the same daughter that wanted to wear a wedding dress to my wedding) Again I got pregnant intentionally she did not. So am I the Ahole for being upset here? I know I cannot control what others name their child but I told them I was doing it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to add. Younger sister in law wants to use the same first, middle and last name. She will not be giving her child the dads last name. I had announced to the family the name of my child weeks ago and she just sent a group text telling us the same name a few hours ago. Older sister in law told me I could not use my husbands first name as that is her second child's middle name as well. I intended to use a first name not in the family, husband and baby would just share middle and obviously last name.

You can't stop them from naming their baby and they can't stop you", "I think the point she is trying to make is re MIL saying OP is stealing the younger sister\u2019s thunder as if OP got pregnant to spite her - OP has been trying for over a year before his sister, who wasnt trying, got pregnant. I dont think she was snarking on her unintentional pregnancy. The same SIL who called her stupid for getting pregnant. The MIL & SIL all sound like they have an issue with OP!", "INFO: How does your husband feel about all of this? \n\nSo far NTA. Usually I agree that people don't own names, but I'm voting NTA because you said you announced the name at the baby shower and she then chose to use the name. \n\nI would feel a little weird if I was pregnant and told my family was naming my kid Tom and then someone in my family immediately decided to use the same name for their baby. \n\nYou don't owe the name, but just... why do that? There are so many names out there, why chose something someone in your family has said they are using for their soon-to-be-born baby?", "NTA. I must say that whether your or your SILs pregnancies were intentional or not means nothing and has no relevance to the situation. Your pregnancy is not special or more important than hers because it was planned and your pregnancy should not be prioritized over hers just because it was planned and hers wasn\u2019t . \n\nWith that out of the way, your feelings about the name situation are completely valid, especially if you had expressed intentions to choose that name publicly among the family. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever encountered two sisters who both named their babies after their brother. I think it\u2019s kind of shifty of your SIL to not give your husband first dibs on his own name and if she\u2019s genuinely the breed of girl who wears white to someone else\u2019s wedding I can\u2019t help thinking that she\u2019s only using that name so that you can\u2019t/won\u2019t be able to, regardless of whether she actually likes the name or not.\n\nI think you have every right to name your baby after your husband even if she goes through with using it too. The family will get tired of clarifying which kid they\u2019re referring to real quick, just do your best to make sure she will have to be the one to use a nickname and reinforce it at every opportunity.", "I'm going with YTA here. You don't own the name and it's not unusual for cousins to have the same name.", "NTA. It\u2019s definitely weird that both SIL are naming their kids after your husband. Don\u2019t they have their own husband/baby daddy for the kids to be their namesake? The fact that younger SIL chose the name AFTER you publicly announced it is just a shitty thing to do to a family member. It sounds like they\u2019re doing it out of spite and not adoration for brother. You should absolutely have first dibs to your husband\u2019s name for his child. Your MIL (monster in law) sounds like a nightmare. The whole family sounds like a dumpster fire. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that your pregnancy has been so stressful instead of celebrated.

It\u2019s a dick move on her part.\n\nI\u2019ve always loved a name and my sister who was pregnant made a comment in passing that she was considering that name if it was a girl.

Not that hard to be considerate of others.", "NAH for the name thing. You being upset is understandable \n\nBut them wanting to use those names is understandable also. \n\nReusing names in the same family is totally fine.

I'm sorry you've had fertility issues, but as the majority of humans who were ever born into this world were the result of an unplanned pregnancy, there's no need for you to make snide comments about mothers who decided to have and keep their baby, whether or not they got pregnant by trying.", "NTA. I think your post may not be super clear.  As I understand it, you and your SIL are both pregnant. You picked a name for your baby that is totally original to the family and planned to use your husbands middle name as the baby\u2019s middle name. You announced this. Only after that, your SIL said she wants to give the exact same name to her kid.  And your MIL is saying you can\u2019t use the name anymore because you are stealing SIL\u201ds thunder.  Name your baby what you want! Who cares what SIL or MIL say. Who cares if the cousins have the same name.\nEDITED TO ADD: OP has now cleared up the copied names with their edit.", "NTA. Talk to your husband.  If you both agree that his middle name is the name you will choose for your son, then he needs to tell his sister and his mother that you two are using the name for your son.  \n\nIt's part of his name, so he should be able to use it for his own child.  I think his sister will back off but it will still be an issue for her and the other two and it will be your fault.  \n\nIt sounds like you have a shitty in-laws problem, the name issue is just a symptom.  The MIL and SILs like to get under your skin.  Don't be so reactive, they get off on it.  You and your husband need to be a united front and he needs to firmly put them in their place when they overstep.", "Info: is she saying you can't use the name too?", "It's normal to name your children after your family names.

However, speaking as a medical professional myself and assuming you guys started trying after marriage, getting pregnant within a year of trying is still within the range of normal. If I misunderstood and you guys had been trying for over 12 months, I can see why you felt the need to stress that your pregnancy was \u201cintentional\u201d while your SIL was \u201cunintentional\u201d. I\u2019m sure it hurts to have someone experience something with such ease when it\u2019s been painstaking for you to have that same joy.

I have made it clear that I was going to use the name. The oldest sister doesn't understand why I am upset as it a \"family name\". My husband is the only one in the family with that name. My husbands oldest sister also named her first child after their dad who has family name it goes back at least 4 generations that I know of. I do not feel my husbands name is a \"family name\" I think that family names go back generations your sibling is not generations. I also am upset that my husbands mom told me I was stealing the youngest daughters thunder as she is due a few days before me.

Also, my fiance's mom named one of my fiance's brothers after her murdered drug addict brother, and he turned out to be an alcoholic. It's kinda funny but kinda sad.
