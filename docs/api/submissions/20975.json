What a down payment is is basically one of two things: either a) a collateral in the case of purchasing services\u2014basically, you are guaranteeing them a pay for their time. This is important because they scheduled you in, so even if you cancel, if it\u2019s too late, they probably can\u2019t get a new appointment and instead have just lost out on x amount of pay. Even if you don\u2019t end up going somewhere, by having an appointment you are using their time by guaranteeing they are there if you show and not helping someone else. Or, in this case, b) in purchasing an asset that requires a loan, you can think off it as \u201cwe\u2019re not loaning you 100% of the asset\u201d. So, if I wanted to buy a 20k car for example and my credit score wasn\u2019t high enough to approve 20k loan without a down payment, the bank that\u2019s taking me on is instead saying \u201chey, we\u2019ll pay for 18k of it in loan, you have to provide the remaining 2k\u201d.

I haven't seen the TikTok but what I'm gleaning from the comments here is that it argues that requiring a down payment is de facto discriminatory against protected classes like racial minorities because they've been systematically locked out from accumulating generational wealth. However, I don't believe any court has found that. It's an interesting discussion but doesn't carry the weight of law. \n\nBecause of generations of systematic discrimination against minorities, other markers of a low-risk borrower are also harder to attain for these same groups. So we could argue that tracking credit scores and charging different interest rates are also de facto discriminatory.
