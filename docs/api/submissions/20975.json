What a down payment is is basically one of two things: either a) a collateral in the case of purchasing services\u2014basically, you are guaranteeing them a pay for their time. This is important because they scheduled you in, so even if you cancel, if it\u2019s too late, they probably can\u2019t get a new appointment and instead have just lost out on x amount of pay. Even if you don\u2019t end up going somewhere, by having an appointment you are using their time by guaranteeing they are there if you show and not helping someone else. Or, in this case, b) in purchasing an asset that requires a loan, you can think off it as \u201cwe\u2019re not loaning you 100% of the asset\u201d. So, if I wanted to buy a 20k car for example and my credit score wasn\u2019t high enough to approve 20k loan without a down payment, the bank that\u2019s taking me on is instead saying \u201chey, we\u2019ll pay for 18k of it in loan, you have to provide the remaining 2k\u201d.

Plus it would have sofas round a fire and a good locally sourced changing seasonal food menu including just some really good sandwiches and definitely lots of sea food small sharing plates),and a small community.

And then from just outside my house I want my own personal and private tunnel that I can drive down but that also has a pod with sofas but is also perfectly wheelchair accessible and is always ready to shuttle me back and forth that brings me up right in to zone 1 London. Maybe like Leicester Square for easy access to theatreland, Oxford Circus for shopping, Soho for food and not too far to walk to the Southbank.
