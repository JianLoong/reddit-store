I have been married to my wife for 8 years. She has two kids, twins, who i\u2019ll call Jane and John (16) from a previous relationship.\n\nWhen the kid\u2019s first moved in, it was a bit tense. They weren\u2019t fond of me, and tried to avoid me.\n\nOvertime, Jane warmed up to me, and 2 years ago has started referring me as \u2018dad\u2019. John however has not warmed up to me, and i\u2019m fine with that. I would love to have a closer relationship though. Its a bit of a struggle, since if I don\u2019t do/give what he wants, its because i\u2019m punishing him for not calling me dad. If I try to talk, or offer him something, its because i\u2019m trying to replace his father. \nI wish he\u2019d see thats not the case, but I know that\u2019ll take some time.\n\nJane calling me dad has strained the twins relationship. John does not refer to Jane as his twin sister, either as his half-sister or step-sister. When it comes to birthdays, their mother splits it into days so both of them have a day for themselves, John does not want Jane around on his day.\nI know this hurts Jane, they weren\u2019t close as siblings, but they still had a relationship.\n\nRecently, Jane hosted a small get together in our backyard. Some of the people invited also know John, but not as close with him as they are with Jane. John found out, and after it ended argued with Jane about it.\n\nJohn was not invited because he has never accepted any invites his sister has given him, and when asks him questions, he has started to ignore her. Jane told him a such.\nJohn argued that some invited were his friends, so he should have been invited. But he never accepted the other time his friends were there.\n\nSo I told John that he shouldnt have been surprised he wasn\u2019t invited with how he has acted in the past. This made him more upset.\n\nI think I over-stepped the line, but my wife and Jane are on my side. AITA?\n\nLittle edit: I did have a talk with my wife. Her and Jane will go talk to John. Just them three. Maybe they can try family therapy again, just them.\nJohn isn\u2019t a bad kid, he was kind with Jane and did put an effort into their relationship before Jane started calling me dad.

Thats messed up.\n\nNTA about time he learnt and felt the consequences of how he treats her.", "NTA John may need to talk to a specialist to work out whatever he is going thru. Sounds as though he has jealousy, resentment and possibly anger issues. As for Jane you said John does not invite her or want her at his Birthday celebration, yet Jane has invited him to hers in the past but not this occasion. Which is perfectly fine and her right. Birth father or not you sound like a good Dad just keep being you.", "Nta, John's being an ah, and needs to be told until.he stops or goes nc", "NTA at all, but it might be a good idea to look into getting John some kind of therapy. There isnt any info on what happened to Johns father, so there may be some trauma there that he has, that Jane does not. He\u2019s young though, and may have a hard time articulating how he is feeling without becoming angry or upset. He is being a total ass, but I have a feeling there is a sad little boy underneath it all who needs some support, and is struggling because his twin sister (a very very special bond) isnt on the same page as him\n\nEdit: just saw OP\u2019s comment saying the kids are in fact, in therapy.

The ONLY reason you feel the least bit bad is because you're trying to form a relationship with John.

NTA. \n\nYou can only give John so much slack. He's being kind of a dick about every situation. Hopefully he matures and realizes that this maybe isn't the family he wants, but it's the one he's got. I'm somewhat of an expert in this because I was a lot like John and I also have a twin. A twin that I bullied regularly because he was \"fat\" and I was agile and sporty. He was \"dumb\" and I excelled at everything I put my mind to. Then we both graduated high school, got jobs and went to college and experienced actual adversity in our lives. That's when we grew closer and started clinging to each other like wreckage in a storm. We've both recently moved in with our significant others (we're both getting married!) and I miss him every single day. \n\nI'm hoping that both your twins can come together in the future. Twins share a unique bond that no other siblings can really enjoy, it'd be a shame for them to end up estranged.", "It looks like John wants the option to actively reject Jane - to be the one calling the shots. When she took away his control of the situation, he got angry. \n\nI sort of get it. When I was a teenager, I had more responsibilities than some of my friends and often had to say no to activities they wanted to do. When they stopped asking, I was very hurt. In their minds, they were saving a step. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t already in family therapy, I highly recommend it. If that isn\u2019t a possibility, ask (or have his mother ask) John to define the relationships he wants to have with his mother; his sister, and you - and how he thinks those are achievable.", "John is being a jackass.

Absolutely not. \nJohn needs to learn his shitty behavior and actions have consequences. \n\nOP you are most definitely NTA, but I understand why you feel the way you do.

And honestly he's entitled to be Frosty with you, it's his feelings. However taking it out on his sister just because she accepted you as a parental figure is when he goes straight into AH territory. He's 16, not 6.", "NTA\u2026 John needs to grow up and stop beeing a complete AH", "NTA, I understand why you think you might\u2019ve overstepped slightly, but given the fact that you\u2019ve been married to your wife for 8 years, parented them both in that time and developed a great relationship with Jane etc. it seems like it is in fact your place to comment and that you were justified in defending Jane. John seems like he needs some help processing his feelings about the family dynamics and your wife could probably take a bigger role in helping the twins mend their relationship. Such a rift between twins is a shame, I\u2019d be interested to know what bio-dad has to say about the situation, if he is still involved.", "NTA\n\nJohn is manipulating you to get what he wants by saying purposefully hurtful things to you to make you question yourself and is using abusive techniques to attempt to control and punish his sister when she disobeys him. John might be a child, but is also almost an adult and a fucking asshole who will suffer a lot later in life, if he doesn't start being more loving and accepting of others.", "NTA. Hes not obligated to call you his dad, but he doesnt get to punish his sister for doing so. If he doesnt want to consider both of you family, then he doesnt get to whine when his twin doesnt want to have anything to do with him", "NTA but i think this is the perfect opportunity for your wife to step up and talk to John and get to the root of the problem. John might sound spoiled to some people but changing family dynamics is so difficult for a kid to comprehend and understand no matter how long it\u2019s been.", "NTA. Actions have consequences", "NTA\n\nDid I read this right - John calls his TWIN sister his step/half sister because he\u2019s annoyed she calls OP \u2018Dad\u2019?! \n\nThis kid sounds like a right arsehole and someone should probably have called him out on it a long time ago.", "NTA. But honestly your wife (not you) should have nipped this in the bud 8 years ago. The separate birthdays, while I understand her reasoning as someone who dates a twin, probably only made it worse. He doesn\u2019t have to accept you. But he has to also respect that his sister does and show you respect. The fact that he\u2019s so disrespectful to you and his twin sister means your wife never corrected this behavior when he was a child. Now he\u2019s an angry teen and it\u2019s just going to get worse.  Consequences have actions.

We hadn\u2019t spoken in three years. I\u2019d moved twice within the city, gotten engaged, and then moved 2500km away. Our brother had a kid. Our auntie died. He had no clue. \n\nThis is what Johns future will look like because I promise no one will want to stick with him.", "My guess is that he feels betrayed that she isnt hating on OP anymore.

John might need some counseling about all of this.", "Jane is John's twin sister not OPs daughter.  He's behaving like this with his own twin because she's more accepting of OP than he is.", "NTA.  You said the truth.  If he's upset, that's on him for his past behavior.", "So John has never known his dad?  Yet still absolutely will not accept you as a father figure?

I will never call recognize him as dad.\"\n\n\n\nI thought it was pretty obvious to read what OP meant by step half sister.\n\n\nJohn was doing it to punish Jane for accepting OP as her dad", "She calls OP dad, she's his daughter.\n\nStep daughter is still daughter", "NTA.

I feel so weird about forcefully creating a family when not everyone is ready. How long did you know the kids for before you and their mother decided to get married? Why is the twin's relationship so bad? Is one favoured over the other? How often do they see their dad?\n\nJohn is still struggling with the change and needs emotional support. How is the co-parenting going do you think? If he doesn't want to talk to family then a therapist could help if he's open to it. Be careful how you bring it up to him.

And as long as you and their mother are on the same page here... I think, perhaps, you need to stop being afraid of being the parent just because it might make him upset. It's only the fact that you're asking this question that's making me think this, but... make sure you aren't confusing things.

To the main question, YTA\n\nYou described clearly how your relationships with them has formed a wedge between the kids. Stop telling John how to be then - stay out of their relationship would be my go to if I were you.\n\nIs Jane calling you Dad worth her losing her brother?\n\nTherapy for them is a good idea, I\u2019d add therapy for you as well so you have someone who can guide you. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re not passively trying to nudge John to be honest. Or you would\u2019ve stayed out or gone to get advice on how to keep the family together. So I\u2019d really recommend get a professional for yourself cause Reddit making you feel better or worse isn\u2019t going to help your family.", "I don't think you're the asshole, but I do think you all need to go to therapy, together. You are a family, just those 3 going does nothing to help your situation or the issues they have involving you.", "I don\u2019t get that. Every other such post people tell stepkids the parents are AHs for forcing things.\n\nBut John is the problem in this one\u2026idk I think OP is good at saying the right things and still nudging things his way\u2026", "I don't mean to put to fine a point on it or undermine Jane;s relationship with OP... but she is less OP's daughter than John's sister and TWIN. John has alienated her by calling her his half sister and step sister, pretending that they aren't actually related. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhich frankly makes John TA and it sucks that he is excluded, but he made that choice. and OP is NTA>", "Jane is John's twin and as such not OP's biological kid. She calls him dad and John, as retaliation, says she's his half or step-sister.", ">He's also the reason my graduation party was cancelled and was somehow shocked I wanted nothing to do with him\n\nYeesh, some people.", "It\u2019s technically possible but very rare!", "Your comment about not paying their tuition surprises me. Are you taking on the role of their father figure, or not?", "NTA, and it's really easy to say what do you think?  Vs. ask questions, so if someone was rude to your friends would you invite them?  if a friend never said yes...would you stop inviting them?   ....ok then", "NAH. Bless you all: it sounds like you\u2019re all trying your best.", "John sounds like a little prick. Nta", "This is the wise answer. I don't get why people think John is childish, he clearly has some unresolved issues. And who wouldn't, with bio dad walking out on pregnant mom, having mom to yourself for 8 years and thenher  marrying a man you hate and being forced to live with him. Completely stepping over his needs as a child. \n\nPO is probably not an asshole. But John isn't neccessarily one either. Just a kid with difficult feelings. And I think it's very undesirable for a parent to go live with a new spouse the children hate.", "So the mom can't marry the man she loves and be happy because her son doesn't like him or the idea? Yeah, no, that's not how it works.", "Jane considers OP her dad, thag makes her his daughter\n\nIt takes more than DNA to make a parent/child bond", "Jane is OPs daughter\n\nHe sees and loves her as a daughter\n\nShe calls him dad\n\nThat makes her his daughter", "She can, but it doesn't make her a good parent to start living with him.", "That's not enough of a consequence for his disrespectful behavior.", "So she should marry him and not live with him? That makes no sense at all.", "A parent is not responsible for paying their child's college tuition. My parents didn't pay for mine and I have no ill will toward them. I worked hard and paid as I went. It gave me a sense of accomplishment to say I did it on my own.", "YTA, but not for the reason you think.  \"John\" clearly has some level of trauma related to you being his stepfather, so you definitely should have let his mother deal with it. His reaction to his sister being close to you demonstrates there is a bigger issue. \n\nYou never mentioned your relationship with the kids, so I have to wonder if he thinks you have overstepped and are trying to be in control as a replacement for his father. He may also believe you are harsher toward him than you are toward her. Who knows. But clearly, you have been aware there's been an issue for years, and that no matter how right you are, he's going to reject your opinions. \n\nTo give an example, I was about 7 when my mother started dating my stepfather, and was 12 when they married. When it came to being punished, my mother basically relinquished her authority to him, which often involved a wooden paddle (plus the typical kid punishments). My sister, on the other hand, never received any type of corporal punishment, and most of her punishments were of shorter duration and not as restrictive. My sister and I were never close, and she had a better relationship with him, but neither of us ever referred to him as \"dad,\" and always referred to him as our stepfather. To be honest, I likely would have been rather annoyed if she had started calling and referring to him as \"dad,\" but since she was a year older we didn't have the same friends, and I never cared if I was invited to any of her parties. \n\nMy father only saw us every other weekend for only about eight hours, so in my case, I felt that it was unfair that this stranger was taken over what rightfully belonged to my father. How is John's relationship with his mother. They definitely need to discuss this. If he hasn't warned up to you by now, it's likely not going to happen. And hus relationship with his sister will likely deteriorate further.", "NTA", "He\u2019s a miserable 16 year old kid. Sounds like you\u2019re doing a great job. Don\u2019t give up on him", "I really hope John can get out of this funk and build a relationship with you guys. NTA.", "NAH, I think John would benefit from some counselling and all of you would benefit from family therapy. However mature he thinks he is, he\u2019s still a child.", "I don\u2019t really think this is an AITA or NTA situation. I think it\u2019s a more complex life situation than that and should be treated with nuance, understanding, compassion, and guidance. \n\nI feel a lot of compassion for this situation for everyone. I feel for OP being a stepparent that is watching one child not accept while the other child does. I feel for Jane ready to accept and want support for that, but I also see John not ready and also want support for that. It\u2019s very layered and a good time to really talk through and honor everyone\u2019s emotions along with guidance on what actionable choices can be made from those feelings and how that can be constructive and destructive. I see an opportunity for life lessons and support for everyone. \n\nThere is a really beautiful series on emotions by Brene Brown on HBO max. It\u2019s helping me understand the depth and importance of emotional care for all humans at every stage of their life. Emotions are such a vital part of being human, yet it\u2019s the most easily overlooked, because most people don\u2019t know how to navigate them.\n\nI think if the kids can understand that there is enough emotional space and support for all of their emotional truths to exist along side each other, that relationships don\u2019t have to be compromised because someone isn\u2019t ready to accept a stepparent. It\u2019s okay for John to not be okay and it\u2019s okay for Jane to be okay. It\u2019s very human to want everyone to be on the same page when they won\u2019t. It allows for emotional autonomy and time to process while also staying a team. A team that can grow and be there for each other! \ud83e\ude77\n\nI think it\u2019s too easy to judge this situation over taking the time to explore it, get to the emotional root and offer space, love, and guidance. I think this situation needs the emotional side to be addressed along with the behavioral choices. \n\nI hope everyone in this situation can get their needs met to the best of their abilities, and can work together to grow together. It\u2019s a very tough situation and I offer compassion and understanding to you all!", "That\u2019s his sister first\u2026 tf you talking about?", "Just in case you missed it, jane and john are twins and both are OP\u2019s step kids,", "That\u2019s f*cked up.", "Jane chooses to be OP's daughter\n\nJohn chooses not to be OP's son \n\nJohn is punishing Jane for her choice and disowned her by calling her \"step/half sister\" so OP has ever right to protect his daughter (step daughter is still daughter, both Jane and OP see each other as father/daughter)\n\n\nWhat's so hard to understand?", "Half-identical twins are also called polar body twins. At the end of the normal process of ovulation, the developing egg divides into two cells. Each cell has the same number of chromosomes in the nucleus, but different amounts of cytoplasm.", "Yeah but the way you put it (Jane is OP\u2019s daughter) makes it sound like you thought she was distinct from john as far as OP is concerned, in that she\u2019s OP\u2019s bio daughter", ">Step daughter is still daughter\n\nNot according to the law. There is very little legal relationship between a stepparent and stepchild.", "Sure, John is being a d*ck, they clearly need therapy they aren\u2019t getting. He\u2019s 16 though, an OP is an adult, and he stuck his nose into a teenager\u2019s business. How is he protecting his daughter? From having a spat with her brother? One that the brother believed was OP\u2019s and Jane\u2019s fault? Doesn\u2019t seem healthy to me. It\u2019s not like John attacked his sister, are they not allowed to argue? I don\u2019t necessarily think OP is an AH, but the kid clearly needs family therapy and some way to channel his emotions in a more healthy way. The OP ought to understand that, that\u2019s all. I\u2019m sure John feels like an outsider is overtaking his importance in his own family, which may not be true, but it still hurts dude.\n\nYou\u2019re telling me you don\u2019t feel nothing for a kid going through that?", "Maybe he's holding onto the idea that he will see his father one day? It is so strange that he has never met his dad but yet is so averse to having a step-father. I'm thinking it might be possible he has been bullied about it when he was at a younger age before his mother met you. Someone must have said something to him. Or perhaps his only way of relieving stress is through hating you.", "I've heard of identical twins (both same gender and look identical), fraternal twins (either same gender or different gender, and don't look exactly alike), and Irish twins (usually not born same time but usually within a year of each other), but this is first time I've heard of half-twins"]}
