When it comes to birthdays, their mother splits it into days so both of them have a day for themselves, John does not want Jane around on his day.\nI know this hurts Jane, they weren\u2019t close as siblings, but they still had a relationship.\n\nRecently, Jane hosted a small get together in our backyard.

It is understandable that he's having a tough time adjusting to a step parent, but he's being an absolute bellend to his sister.  Tbh your wife should be putting a stop to it.  He needs a therapist.", "nta", "NTA. His shitty behaviour caused consequences. Maybe this will teach him.", "I think it's fine for OP to point it out.\n\n\nJohn is actively treating Jane (OP's daughter) poorly and trying to hurt her as a punishment of accepting OP as her dad.\n\n\nOP has the right to protect his daughter", "She isn\u2019t", "Both the twins are in therapy, and we did do family therapy", "100% but John doesn't seem to respect OP, which is why I said not the best option. OP was definitely within reason!", "NTA.\n\nHe's not upset about missing his sister's birthday because they're close.  He's upset about missing a party because their common friends are also going to be there.\n\nHe can't have it both ways.  He has to actually have a relationship with her for her to want him around on her day.\n\nQuestion:  Has he ever gotten therapy?  You don't mention their Dad at all.  Is he a deadbeat, or has he passed away?  You might even need family therapy to navigate her considering you Dad and him not.  He evidently has very strong feelings about this.", "Confused why does he call his twin bio sister a half or step sister? Thats messed up.\n\nNTA about time he learnt and felt the consequences of how he treats her.", "NTA John may need to talk to a specialist to work out whatever he is going thru. Sounds as though he has jealousy, resentment and possibly anger issues. As for Jane you said John does not invite her or want her at his Birthday celebration, yet Jane has invited him to hers in the past but not this occasion. Which is perfectly fine and her right. Birth father or not you sound like a good Dad just keep being you.", "Nta, John's being an ah, and needs to be told until.he stops or goes nc", "NTA at all, but it might be a good idea to look into getting John some kind of therapy. There isnt any info on what happened to Johns father, so there may be some trauma there that he has, that Jane does not. He\u2019s young though, and may have a hard time articulating how he is feeling without becoming angry or upset. He is being a total ass, but I have a feeling there is a sad little boy underneath it all who needs some support, and is struggling because his twin sister (a very very special bond) isnt on the same page as him\n\nEdit: just saw OP\u2019s comment saying the kids are in fact, in therapy. Still NTA. I hope John can adjust better and will start to do better once getting out of this angsty angry stage.", "John should be in counseling.", "NTA,NTA,NTA!  I don't need to comment. You are so not the AH.", "John sounds exhausting", "NTA. John better stop fucking around before he completely destroys his relationship with Jane.", "NTA. And two words which might make everyone happier/ boarding school.", "You\u2019re slightly the AH because, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but who was talking to you? Was this a three way conversation? Or were you listening and then interjected? NTA for what you said, but if they were speaking amongst themselves I can see why he might find you slightly annoying.", "NTA. Sounds like he thinks he is entitled to act as he wishes with no consequences. That\u2019s not how the world goes round.", "NTA. Kids don't only learn with positive reinforcement. Calm explanations of their mistakes is a great teacher too.", "NTA\n\nHopefully, as he grows up, he will grow out of the whole \"you're nice to the person I don't like, so now I don't like you\" phase.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou respect John's boundaries as a step parent but that doesn't mean he gets to dictate how the conversation goes for fear of upsetting him.", "NTA.\n\nYou told him something pretty obvious that a family member OR stranger could have easily seen/said.\n\nI hope things get better for you and John. I had a step dad once and we were super close. A relationship with a step parent is really special imo, because they don't HAVE to love you so when they do it feels like they chose to.", "NTA. The ONLY reason you feel the least bit bad is because you're trying to form a relationship with John.  Frankly it's sad they don't have a better relationship, but all the same he's out of line for getting upset about that.  As far as I'm concerned, the only people that should be at a party you're throwing, are the ones you want to party with.", "NTA. He can\u2019t treat his sister like garbage and be shocked that she doesn\u2019t want him around.", "NTA he needs to hear it.", "John wants to be the pouty teen who wants to throw fits, despite the fact he's ready to become a legal adult in a couple years. NTA. He has to learn his behavior has consequences", "Neutral.  However, it is not universal that siblings are invited to backyard get-togethers with a few mates.  TBH, it is more weird to expect it and get upset about it.  Get your own friends and life.", "You've got backing from the only other two people in the household. NTA. \n\nYou can only give John so much slack. He's being kind of a dick about every situation. Hopefully he matures and realizes that this maybe isn't the family he wants, but it's the one he's got. I'm somewhat of an expert in this because I was a lot like John and I also have a twin. A twin that I bullied regularly because he was \"fat\" and I was agile and sporty. He was \"dumb\" and I excelled at everything I put my mind to. Then we both graduated high school, got jobs and went to college and experienced actual adversity in our lives. That's when we grew closer and started clinging to each other like wreckage in a storm. We've both recently moved in with our significant others (we're both getting married!) and I miss him every single day. \n\nI'm hoping that both your twins can come together in the future. Twins share a unique bond that no other siblings can really enjoy, it'd be a shame for them to end up estranged.", "It looks like John wants the option to actively reject Jane - to be the one calling the shots. When she took away his control of the situation, he got angry. \n\nI sort of get it. When I was a teenager, I had more responsibilities than some of my friends and often had to say no to activities they wanted to do. When they stopped asking, I was very hurt. In their minds, they were saving a step. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t already in family therapy, I highly recommend it. If that isn\u2019t a possibility, ask (or have his mother ask) John to define the relationships he wants to have with his mother; his sister, and you - and how he thinks those are achievable.", "John is being a jackass. He can\u2019t have it both ways. You aren\u2019t at fault for explaining what John is too blind/bratty to see. \n\nNTA", "NTA\nBut John needs to grow up.", "NTA - John doesn't want Jane around on his day, but wants to be included on her day? Absolutely not. \nJohn needs to learn his shitty behavior and actions have consequences. \n\nOP you are most definitely NTA, but I understand why you feel the way you do. It's hard being in that situation. But to be honest... most 16yr old boys despise their father/father figures for those few years. So there's that added on top. You did the right thing.", "NTA - you didn't overstep, he's been trampling on her feeling for God knows how long and now he's seeing the consequences of his actions. \n\nI get he will never see you as a father. And honestly he's entitled to be Frosty with you, it's his feelings. However taking it out on his sister just because she accepted you as a parental figure is when he goes straight into AH territory. He's 16, not 6.", "NTA\u2026 John needs to grow up and stop beeing a complete AH", "NTA, I understand why you think you might\u2019ve overstepped slightly, but given the fact that you\u2019ve been married to your wife for 8 years, parented them both in that time and developed a great relationship with Jane etc. it seems like it is in fact your place to comment and that you were justified in defending Jane. John seems like he needs some help processing his feelings about the family dynamics and your wife could probably take a bigger role in helping the twins mend their relationship. Such a rift between twins is a shame, I\u2019d be interested to know what bio-dad has to say about the situation, if he is still involved.", "NTA\n\nJohn is manipulating you to get what he wants by saying purposefully hurtful things to you to make you question yourself and is using abusive techniques to attempt to control and punish his sister when she disobeys him. John might be a child, but is also almost an adult and a fucking asshole who will suffer a lot later in life, if he doesn't start being more loving and accepting of others.", "NTA. Hes not obligated to call you his dad, but he doesnt get to punish his sister for doing so. If he doesnt want to consider both of you family, then he doesnt get to whine when his twin doesnt want to have anything to do with him", "NTA but i think this is the perfect opportunity for your wife to step up and talk to John and get to the root of the problem. John might sound spoiled to some people but changing family dynamics is so difficult for a kid to comprehend and understand no matter how long it\u2019s been.", "NTA. Actions have consequences", "NTA\n\nDid I read this right - John calls his TWIN sister his step/half sister because he\u2019s annoyed she calls OP \u2018Dad\u2019?! \n\nThis kid sounds like a right arsehole and someone should probably have called him out on it a long time ago.", "NTA. But honestly your wife (not you) should have nipped this in the bud 8 years ago. The separate birthdays, while I understand her reasoning as someone who dates a twin, probably only made it worse. He doesn\u2019t have to accept you. But he has to also respect that his sister does and show you respect. The fact that he\u2019s so disrespectful to you and his twin sister means your wife never corrected this behavior when he was a child. Now he\u2019s an angry teen and it\u2019s just going to get worse.  Consequences have actions. If you\u2019re going to act like a jerk, then don\u2019t be surprised people don\u2019t want to be around you.", "That\u2019s what my younger brother did. He expected everyone to put effort into maintaining a relationship with him while he could come and go as he wanted, cuss us out for expecting him to follow through with commitments, and generally be a dick. For example, on my 18th birthday he no showed for dinner, called me a bitch for being upset, and then took like 40% of my cake upstairs to eat alone in his room. \n\nEveryone decided he wasn\u2019t worth the effort and stopped reaching out. \n\nHe only realized he\u2019d driven everyone away like 6 years later when he tried to show up at mine, drunk, looking for a place to crash. We hadn\u2019t spoken in three years. I\u2019d moved twice within the city, gotten engaged, and then moved 2500km away. Our brother had a kid. Our auntie died. He had no clue. \n\nThis is what Johns future will look like because I promise no one will want to stick with him.", "My guess is that he feels betrayed that she isnt hating on OP anymore. Was probably in a \"us vs him\" situation but his siter grew up and he didnt", "Both twins are in therapy, we have done family therapy \nAs for the twins father, he left when my wife was pregnant with them.", "Calls her that because she refers to me as \u2018dad\u2019. He said they couldn\u2019t be siblings because they now have different dads.", "OP said both the twins are in therapy, and that they even do family therapy.", "You don't need to be a parent to point out logical consequences. Furthermore, Jane deserves to have her father figure stick up for her.", "Isn\u2019t Jane the full sister/twin of John?  Very weird John calls her his stepsister now.  John might need some counseling about all of this.", "Jane is John's twin sister not OPs daughter.  He's behaving like this with his own twin because she's more accepting of OP than he is.", "NTA.  You said the truth.  If he's upset, that's on him for his past behavior.", "So John has never known his dad?  Yet still absolutely will not accept you as a father figure?  Not saying he should call you dad if he doesn\u2019t want to - but he has some deep seeded resentment/abandonment issues it seems. And he\u2019s just being nasty to his sister with the party and calling her his step/half. \nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re in therapy.", "Man that is pretty nasty behavior on his part.", "Because John thinks Jane betrayed him and calls OP dad when he himself doesn't want to do it.\n\n\nJohn is basically saying \"you're no longer my sister because you choose OP to be your dad. I will never call recognize him as dad.\"\n\n\n\nI thought it was pretty obvious to read what OP meant by step half sister.\n\n\nJohn was doing it to punish Jane for accepting OP as her dad", "She calls OP dad, she's his daughter.\n\nStep daughter is still daughter"]}
