She wouldn't, right? Even if she had no great secrets. You just happen to write some of your private thoughts down, but they are the same as if they were in your head -- not meant for anyone else.\n\nHopefully that will click with her. If it doesn't, she may have to lump it instead of liking it and time will be what helps her get over it."]}
