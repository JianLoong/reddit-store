She had accidentally transferred me money when she was supposed to send it to someone else. In Canada we have etransfers and mine is set to auto deposit. I check my account and sure enough, she had sent me $300. \n\nAt the time my account was overdrawn from a recent emergency surgery for my cat.  Even with her deposit my account was in the minus. I told her I couldn't access the money as the overdraft was extended past its limit but can return it on payday. \n\nShe got really angry and accused me of lying even though I sent her screenshots. She said this money was urgent now and then she threatening legal action. I told her to do whatever she wants in the meantime, but I'll send it on payday and hung up. She's been harrassing me nonstop since and getting progressively ruder and downright vile. \n\nShe's been telling our mutual friends I'm a thief and saying a lot of really harsh personal things that she only knows because we were old friends. She told people things that were none of their business and things I would never want them to know about me. She's made it so that I'm uncomfortable with the idea of seeing my own friends because of what she said to them. Now I'm just angry. \n\nI'm consulting a lawyer friend about whether I could keep the money and if he says yes, I don't want to send her anything. A few of my friends disagreed and said she needs the money, I have no right to it (even if I do legally) and it would be a major asshole move. \n\nI get paid on Wednesday. Would I be the asshole to just keep it at this point (if I'm legally allowed to)?\n\nTL;DR: old friend accidentally sent money and it went into my overdrawn account. I can't pay her till payday. She's been harassing me nonstop and saying horrible things to our friends about me. If there are no legal repercussions, WIBTA if I didn't return the money?\n\nEdit: it was recommended I add this into the post. She's shown up at my house at all hours banging on the door scaring my animals and she calls me nonstop. I never want to leave my house because I'm scared I'll find her standing outside. I had to take my recovering cat to stay with my mom because she scares the shit out of him all the time. If for no other reason, I won't keep the money to make her go away.", "created_utc": 1672060993, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvn1ed/wibta_if_i_didnt_return_money_someone/", "score": 1181, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Its not ok to be a thief just because someone calls you a thief.\n\n\nFair enough you can't pay it back right now, but on payday it should be the 1st thing you do.", "YWBTA if you don't return the money. However please make sure the money is really in your account  before you return it. I don't know the details but in the US it can take a few days before the money is verified as being there even if you see it. Make sure you aren't being scammed - protect yourself. Then return the money.\n\nHowever your friend is also TA. You didn't ask for her to accidentally send you money. Your financial situation is what it is. You can't return what you don't have at the moment.  You have to send back the money - but she is gong to need to wait.", "YWBTA if you didn't return it. Legally you might be in the clear, but this isn't a legal advice thread. It's not your money, the right thing is to return it as soon as you are able.", "I think you know this would be an asshole move. You just want to be spiteful. You\u2019re only proving her right though and these bystanders will probably assume all the things she\u2019s been saying are true since you are keeping her money.", "So I\u2019ll say YWBTA with a caveat.\n\nObviously, don\u2019t keep money that isn\u2019t yours.  Also, you can\u2019t send money back that you don\u2019t have.  Sucks for your friend, but there\u2019s nothing you can do.  But as soon as you can send the money back, you\u2019re an AH for keeping it.\n\nHowever there are two reasons for keeping the money a bit longer that I think are legit:\n  1. There are a ton of Venmo/Zelle/instant transfer scams.  You need to make sure that the money you were sent is really yours before you send anything back.  People don\u2019t know that those transfers are reversible in some cases, and your friend may have started the process.  The worst place you can be is to send them $300 and lose the money they sent you.  Idk how it works in Canada, but be careful.\n\n  2. Don\u2019t go negative paying them back.  Depending on your bank account, being overdrawn can work in different ways, but you shouldn\u2019t incur expense paying them back.

You\u2019re currently not the asshole for not having the money to pay her at the moment. She\u2019s the asshole for running her mouth. Pay her back and go no contact and block her. Never speak to her again. If you keep the money she is just going to keep causing problems and run her mouth even more. Best thing to do is shut her up. Karma will even her ass out don\u2019t worry.

You're upset that she's spreading rumours about you being a thief so you're going to get back at her by... completely proving her right?", "YTA i think in this case you return the money and cut all contact. This person made a mistake and when you were not able to return the money. This is no one at fault. However she is TA for making your business everyone\u2019s business.

Serves her right, yeah?  Why not keep her $300 at this point?\n\nSo I get you, but it sounds like she\u2019s doing this because that $300 means a lot to her right now.  She\u2019s obviously not going about it the right way, but it\u2019s still in your best interest to return it.  Be able to tell your mutual friends the whole story, including the part where she got her $300 back.\n\n$300 really ain\u2019t shit in the scheme of life, and I think you\u2019ll have no regrets about returning the funds in time.", "YWBTA.

She had accidentally transferred me money when she was supposed to send it to someone else. In Canada we have etransfers and mine is set to auto deposit. I check my account and sure enough, she had sent me $300. \n\nAt the time my account was overdrawn from a recent emergency surgery for my cat.  Even with her deposit my account was in the minus. I told her I couldn't access the money as the overdraft was extended past its limit but can return it on payday. \n\nShe got really angry and accused me of lying even though I sent her screenshots. She said this money was urgent now and then she threatening legal action. I told her to do whatever she wants in the meantime, but I'll send it on payday and hung up. She's been harrassing me nonstop since and getting progressively ruder and downright vile. \n\nShe's been telling our mutual friends I'm a thief and saying a lot of really harsh personal things that she only knows because we were old friends. She told people things that were none of their business and things I would never want them to know about me. She's made it so that I'm uncomfortable with the idea of seeing my own friends because of what she said to them. Now I'm just angry. \n\nI'm consulting a lawyer friend about whether I could keep the money and if he says yes, I don't want to send her anything. A few of my friends disagreed and said she needs the money, I have no right to it (even if I do legally) and it would be a major asshole move. \n\nI get paid on Wednesday. Would I be the asshole to just keep it at this point (if I'm legally allowed to)?\n\nTL;DR: old friend accidentally sent money and it went into my overdrawn account. I can't pay her till payday. She's been harassing me nonstop and saying horrible things to our friends about me. If there are no legal repercussions, WIBTA if I didn't return the money?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That's fair enough that your hands are tied, but if it was you, or really anyone else in an emergency, I doubt you'd be patient and grateful while sitting back and waiting for the money to be returned. She's not a terrible person for panicking and wanting it back now, it's what she did later on which makes her bad.

There are big bold letters warning you before you hit send to make sure you have selected/entered the correct email.

But situations like this happen at sender errors, thankfully it's rare but embarrassing.The only way I see this as intentional is if the acquaintance had a bone to pick with OP and did this on purpose to run her name through the mud. For American redditors, e-transfer is direct person to person money transfer (like handing someone 20$, but digitally) and you need to have the sender's email to send the money to them. You can't stop payment like a check or through an app or the bank. Once sent it's gone and if it's an error you can report it, but it's up to the goodwill of the recipient to send it back.
