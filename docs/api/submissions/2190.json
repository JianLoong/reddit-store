I\u2019ve been working in a public library for the past year and a half as an assistant and I\u2019m planning on applying for librarian positions when I graduate. This has been the plan since I was in high school. \n\nMy dad recently reconnected with a cousin he\u2019s never been very close to and who I\u2019ve never met. He learned that his cousin has a son (my second cousin) who has been working in a museum in another country and recently moved back home. Today he told me that he wanted to arrange a lunch with the family because the son could potentially help me get a job when I graduate. \n\nFor my graduate program, I could\u2019ve chosen between a few different pathways, including museum/archival studies and public or academic libraries. Obviously, I wanted to work in a public library so I\u2019ve been taking classes pertaining to that field. \n\nI told my dad I\u2019d be happy to meet the family but I don\u2019t think that he\u2019d have any connections in the library realm, considering he has a completely different degree than I do, works in a different field, and hasn\u2019t even been working in the country. My dad said he could get me a job in a museum, and I said I didn\u2019t want to work in a museum, I wanted to work in a library, which is why I\u2019ve been working at one trying to gain experience and make my own connections. \n\nHe and my mom responded by saying they didn\u2019t even know I wanted to work in a public library, which kind of pissed me off because they\u2019re pretty involved in my life. We live close enough to each other that I usually see them once a week, my mom and I text constantly, and since I\u2019m in school they still help me out financially. Just yesterday I was telling my mom about hearing from an former coworker that their new librarian wasn\u2019t doing too well and that it\u2019d be great if that position was open in a few months when I graduate. \n\nI reiterated that I was perfectly fine with my dad arranging a lunch for me to meet this family but that I wasn\u2019t going to try to get this guy to introduce me to museum archivists or anything. He got mad and started saying \u201cDon\u2019t meet them then! Don\u2019t go to lunch!\u201d angrily. He went into another room for the rest of my visit. He came out to hug me goodbye before I left and didn\u2019t seem mad anymore but I don\u2019t know what I did to piss him off.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that while the cousin works in a museum, he doesn\u2019t have a library and information science degree.

Even if he had the same job you\u2019re looking for, it would feel pretty gross to me, unless it came up in conversation organically.\n\nMy Dad does this, a lot. He half-listens when I tell him things, then decides he\u2019s got the \u201cperfect!\u201d solution. And it\u2019s not.

Library positions are extremely hard to come by. The reality is you may have to get related experience to build up your resume while looking for a desired job. Plus, many museums have libraries or similar areas that you might like if you at least looked into it.\n\nSo, you're NTA but you are being short-sighted, naive, and painfully idealistic.", "NTA\n\nBut just be careful closing doors. Librarian jobs aren't easy to come by and you might have to move far away if you that job.", "You can't control other people and it's not your job to manage them. Do you and expect others to handle their own crap including their emotions.", "I guess my definition of small town might be different than yours. For a town with fewer than 40,000 people, our public library has a staff of 24. Three full-time reference librarians all have their degrees, and one part-timer is in school currently. We had a fourth full-time reference librarian with her masters degree, but she left in September for a job in a bigger city. There are 4 other people with their MLIS working at my library. So the numbers by themselves aren't super impressive.  I  just wanted to point out that a Masters degree in Library and Information Science wasn't a waste.", "I'm guessing your dad was just embarrassed that he'd spoken to his family about possibly connecting you with the cousin's network and now he was going to look bad and like he didn't know you at all. That can be a shock to anyone's system. Don't be mad at your parents for not understanding the nuances of being a librarian. They might had assumed all libraries were the same and needed the same skill set even if they were in different settings. You're not the asshole here and dad was just trying to help.", "NTA for how you handled the entire situation, with a *slight* NAH for the overall argument.\n\nYour father is right that you do need certain connections to get into a library profession, which is surprising competitive (according to a librarian friend I used to know). However, you are mostly in the right for not asking your extended family for helping you find a job with the lunch meet. It may also seem extremely rude and selfish to your distant cousin and family; it wouldn\u2019t look good to you that, after so much time passed, the only reason that your parents reached out to the extended family was to help you get a job. That probably wouldn\u2019t go over to well\u2026\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t bad enough, your parents didn\u2019t even know what your dream and major was, let alone the fact that your cousin was working in an completely different field than you. You may be seen as short sighted for not pulling strings, but you\u2019re also being realistic and showing maturity and pride in your hard-earned skills.\n\nReach out to your cousin to catch up on your own terms. You\u2019ll become a librarian when people see you are legit. Good luck with the job hunt!", "NTA, but what your father likely knows and you may not have figured out yet is how often contacts and connections get people jobs, even when the likelihood isnt obvious. Meeting the other family will cost you an hour, and it may not get you a job, but it's good practice. I suspect a hundred redditors herecould testify that they got jobs or heard about jobs via acquaintances and contacts. It's the way the world works. Look up *guanxi*.", "NTA.

You know other people in your field, you know their typical job progressions, and educational requirements.\n\nYou\u2019ve got a realistic expectation - it\u2019s great to meet this family member, and it never hurts to have some extra connections, but it\u2019s highly unlikely you\u2019ll get a job from this meetup.", "NTA. The museum world is different than the library world and they don't seem to want to understand that.

You could humor your family and go to lunch to get them off your back.", "I do have related experience. I\u2019ve been working full-time as a library assistant (a step below librarian) in a large library system. In fact, all of the librarians at my branch started out as assistants within the system and were promoted after they finished their MLIS. Of course I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ll be offered a librarian position immediately after graduation or anything like that, but I frequently see job openings in my area, both inside and outside of my system. There\u2019s nothing wrong with museum/archival positions at all, it\u2019s just that public librarianship is the field I\u2019ve been working in for almost two years and the focus of the track I\u2019m on in my program.", "Yeah like, maybe it would be best to go and talk enough shop with this guy to help your parents (maybe both sets) realize that just because you're in the same general field that this is kinda like asking a surgeon to try and help a GP get a job?", "Thank you! And haha I agree, I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019ll enjoy spending time with this family or vice versa, and my dad\u2019s only met with them the one time. I think it would be kind of presumptive to be like, \u201cHey, you think you can get me a job?\u201d", "I mean, not really. It's like asking a surgeon to try and help a family medicine doctor get a job. Yeah they're both doctors and there's a chance that the former *might* have the right connections to help the latter, but it's more likely that the latter has plenty of the right connections of their own and it will just be wasting everyone's time.", "You had your parents pay for graduate school so you can be a public librarian. Being any kind of librarian is wonderful. Reading is beyond important. But you do not need a graduate degree to be a librarian at a public library. You wasted years and thousands of dollars getting a degree you don\u2019t need for the job you knew you wanted.", "I assume most of the people responding are young. Did you parents pay for your schooling? If you wanted to be a librarian at a public library you don\u2019t need a degree.

You wasted thousands of your parents dollars. They have every right to be upset.", "They aren\u2019t paying my tuition, actually. And yes some libraries don\u2019t require a graduate degree to be a librarian. However, in my region (where I\u2019d like to stay) and my entire state based on the research I\u2019ve done, an MLIS is required. Plus, I\u2019m assuming a librarian anywhere would need at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, and I will have only spent 5 years total in undergrad + grad, so not really that much time wasted.", "Are you a librarian?\n  \nYour statement sounds like perhaps you are not.\n  \nSure, lots of librarians at public libraries have only an undergraduate degree. But they have to be either very well connected or have amazing experience, enough to stand out compared to other candidates who *do* have a graduate degree library sciences.\n  \nDepending on the state, most public libraries won't even LOOK at your application if you don't have a graduate degree in library sciences.", "\u201cWasted\u201d thousands of my own dollars actually, and they\u2019re not upset that I went to grad school to be a public librarian, (which is standard in my area), they\u2019re upset that I don\u2019t want to ask a distant relative I just met for a job as an archival librarian in a museum.", "How are you paying for you tuition if your parents aren\u2019t paying and you have been working as a librarian? Also how would you do a bachelor and grad program in 5 years? Doesn\u2019t sound real.", "Um\u2026 have any of you been to a public library in the past 5 years? They are begging for employees. If what you are saying is you won\u2019t take anything but head librarian to start then yes I expect you will have many issues. I\u2019m not a Librarian, I own a graphic design company. But I have been a public library member in at least 10 states and not one of the people who ran the library had masters. They were wonderfully smart and creative people but they didn\u2019t feel the need to spend 8 plus years in school wasting money before they started doing their job.", "I work in a small town library.  People are desperate to get their foot in the door here. All the full-time reference librarians have their Masters degree,  even a lot of part-timers do too, trying to get experience to get a full-time position.", "I\u2019ve taken out loans. You could definitely consider that a waste of money, but regardless, it\u2019s not my parents\u2019 money, it\u2019s my money, or rather, my future money. \n\nI haven\u2019t been working as a librarian, I\u2019ve been working as a library assistant, which is a position immediately below a librarian and typically requires an associate\u2019s or a bachelor\u2019s degree in my area depending on the library. \n\nI took several AP classes in high school and took a few summer classes to finish my bachelor\u2019s in three years. \n\nMy grad program requires 37 credits, twelve 3-credit classes plus a 1 credit final project. I\u2019ve taken 3 classes/9 credits a semester (and will also take the 1 credit project in the last semester). That\u2019s 4 semesters or 2 years.", "You have zero respect for your parents. In about 10 years you will be so embarrassed.", "There\u2019s definitely an argument to be made that MLIS shouldn\u2019t be required to be a librarian. I\u2019ve honestly learned more being on the reference desk, helping with programs, etc., than I have in grad school. However, the fact remains that in my area, you need a MLIS to be a librarian, and the same is true for other libraries in my state that I\u2019ve looked into during job searches. I\u2019m not in grad school for shits and giggles. \n\nAnd no, I\u2019m not saying I won\u2019t take anything but head librarian. Being hired as a head librarian/department manager at my age and right out of grad school is laughable and never crossed my mind. But a regular librarian position, yes. \n\nAlso, I spent 3 years in undergrad and I\u2019ll finish my master\u2019s in 2 years. So 5 years total. I know some people need to take longer for a variety of reasons but I don\u2019t believe 8+ (for just the master\u2019s degree?) is the general rule.", "Why are you so hostile about a stranger\u2019s education and chosen career path? What made you question all these librarians to know they don\u2019t have masters degrees? Why do you think it takes 8 years to get a masters? You can get a doctorate in that time.", "You work in a small town library but have numerous full-time reference librarians? Plus a number of part time people? Have any of you actually been to a library?", "Damn. If you don\u2019t feel like you wasted your time that is important. Good luck with your loans and being a public librarian. Glad your parents are not in the line.", "Why are you an asshole?", "No 8 years for both degrees. If you are comfortable spending your own money for the job you want, go for it. But we are talking public library, not university library, or specialized library. I\u2019m sure your teachers all told you, you needed this special degree. But the fact is if you went and worked at a library 5 years ago you would be far better prepared than classes.", "What did the librarian do to you? Did one take out your entire family 2 days before retirement or something?", "It's ok to say you didn't understand how other people might value things that aren't money, but say that, instead of really not understanding that people live full and complete lives in a system designed to work them to the bone, by simply finding work that they love.\n\nYou must be great at parties with that attitude though", "The job postings at every public library in my area said I needed an MLIS, not my teachers. And I agree, working in the field prepares you better than school in many jobs, including this one. But I can\u2019t do much about the libraries requiring a certain education level (unless, of course, I do become head librarian lol)", "You're awfully sure of what's required for a librarian and for this person's life for someone wholly unconnected to either this person or their field.\n  \nAlso, OP *has* been working in a library for the past few years. As an assistant,  but that's going to get them the connections they need. And experience, and knowledge that will help them, along with that degree.\n  \nWhat is it, exactly that irks you? Because it sounds as if you are looking down your nose at people with master's degrees.", ">You're awfully sure of what's required for a librarian and for this person's life for someone wholly unconnected to either this person or their field.\n\nAgreed...wondering if a librarian did this person wrong once or something.
