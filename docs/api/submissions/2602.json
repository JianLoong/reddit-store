This is the way he will sneakily try to treat my husband an example of this is him purposely saying \u201che doesn\u2019t know his age\u201d. Which is a lie. He was condescending and my dear mother was on my side but we chose to leave. Our apartment was completely isolated and you will only be able to hear anything if you were intentionally eavesdropping (by going next to the door as it was on top of the garage).\n\nMe and my husband couldn\u2019t be asked with his immaturity & his snide comments whilst we were there so we went to a local airbnb, which we have been staying at the last couple of days.\n\nI still can\u2019t believe he made it seem like I wasn\u2019t being respectful or that I am the asshole in the slightest for doing what I do with my HUSBAND.

After 2 nights my cousin came to my grandparents and admitted they have been dating for a bit and have had trouble sleeping without each other. My grandma and grandpa thought that was adorable and sweet!! I remember my family hunting to them wanting to have sex but also just being with each other. If my 85 (at time 70\u2019s) grandparents who secretly baptized me as catholic can handle two people dating and sleeping together (sex or not) your dad should be able to. At least he could keep it to little comments. You are grown. So is he.
