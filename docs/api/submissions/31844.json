I (26F) live in a shared flat with another girl (28F). We have our own bedrooms, and the living rooms + kitchen are shared. I didn't know her prior to moving in, and found the listing online. When I moved into the apartment, the living room was unfurnished, because the previous tenant who had my (current) room had moved out and my flatmate did not own any furniture. I moved in with a lot - a couch, dining table, coffee table, rugs, curtains, etc. As well as some appliances like a fridge, induction stove, microwave, and food processor.

She constantly has friends over who stay for multiple days at a time and treat my things as their own. My sofas have stains on them from food and drinks, my rugs are dirty from their being stepped on, and my coffee table is wobbly. I personally only have friends over occasionally and make sure to clean up after them. I'm frustrated at her callousness and have told her at multiple points that this is not okay, and if her guests want to stay over then it needs to be in her room, on her furniture - not mine. She agrees but a few days later, there is inevitably an emergency - her friend is coming over and has nowhere else to go, her boyfriend is getting kicked out of his place and needs a place to crash, someone's flight is getting delayed and they need to spend the night - there's always an excuse.

I'm moving some of the furniture into my own room, and since I don't personally use the microwave or induction stove - I'm packing these up and shipping them off to my parent's home. I know it sounds insensitive but my flatmate hasn't paid for any of these things, but uses them recklessly and without care. My fear is that the things that I have saved for and bought will eventually become damaged and/or useless, and it won't even be because of my own use. I also plan to roll up all the rugs and put them away, only placing them back when I'm entertaining my own guests. This will make the house look pretty bare every day, but it will prevent further dirtying of my stuff. \n\nin your opinion, is this an asshole move, or am i justified?", "created_utc": 1701078775, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184zehf/wibta_if_i_stopped_sharing_my_things_with_my/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
