The way they explained it to me, she's their \"3rd partner\" I guess it's some poly thing IDK I don't follow that stuff. I guess they're still married and all that, but she's more like a \"secondary\" partner.\n\nThe last few months were weird, but I was managing. They'd warn me in advance if she was coming over, or if they were going to her place. I could handle that, but what was awkward is that in the mornings after, she's usually still there. It's a little freaky getting ready for school and making small talk when you know why they're here.\n\nHer visits were getting more and more common, and my parents wanted to have a talk with me, she's moving in. The spare room will be her room, and they'll all live together as a throuple. I don't think I can handle that, it's just too weird, especially since she's closer to my age than theirs.\n\nNow she's friendly enough, but it's still weird, like she's halfway between family friend and stepmom. It's not any one thing really, it's just that the whole situation is just too much too fast for me. My grandparents live nearby and I'm always welcome to stay there, so I told my parents I'm just gonna live with them at least until I finish school.  \n\nThey didn't take it well. They think I hate them and I'm not being open minded. I explained I still love them and I want to live with them, but on top of being uncomfortable I don't want to explain to my friends who the young woman who lives in our spare room is. Plus I admit, it really does gross me out when I see this woman being affectionate with my parents (They never do anything inappropriate in front of me, but still)\n\nThey said I was being bigoted and that they were disappointed in me, but let me go and said my room will be waiting for me. Now I fell awful and wonder if maybe I should've just kept my head down until college.", "created_utc": 1684381843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13knmyj/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_if_their_3rd/", "score": 1579, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Amazing how so many people who claim to be \"open minded\" are so \"close minded\" when others don't agree with them. If the 27F moves in, it's going to get weird(er) real quick. The grandparents seem like a really good option.", "NTA.  What an uncomfortable situation to put one's child through.  That's not really fair to you, and it's not exactly good practice to just move people into the same home that their children live in.  They are free to live their life how they want to, but at the same time, they need to be considerate of you since you still live in their home.  They could also wait until you are in college to move their 3rd partner in.  I don't think it's on you to have to deal with their relationship choices.", "N T A.

They could have waited 2 years until you were out of school for college, but they decided to make their uncomfortable daughter even more uncomfortable. \n\nThey put a double whammy on you, The throuple situation and the pretty big age gap. Either one would be hard for any body to take, but throwing both of them at you at once, then trying to guilt you into accepting it, makes them huge assholes.\n\nGo live with your grandparents, don't let your parents manipulate you into thinking you are wrong for needing space and time to process such a big change in your family dynamic. \n\nYou honestly sound like you are really trying to accept your parents' new poly lifestyle, with them steam rolling ahead ignoring your actual well-being.\n\nAs someone not in the poly lifestyle, even I can tell your parents are full of it.

Asking you to share a home with a relative stranger, and basically have their sex life thrown in your face is something completely different.", "Move in with your grandparents, you will not regret it.", "NTA, it would be the same deal as a single parent bringing in their new partner to live in the house. Some kids are uncomfortable with the thought of a stranger living in their home, who potentially will try to take on a parental role that wasn't wanted. If you feel like you need to distance yourself, take that opportunity and later on have a discussion with your parents after mulling over their relationship for a bit, maybe by then you guys will come to an agreement on how to operate the family", "Nta.\nYou acccept your parent choice.

I know you're not interested in what your folks are into, and that perfectly fine. But a key tennant, the 1st commandment of any kind of sexual relationship is to have all parties knowingly and fully consenting. While you are not directly involved with their sex lives, you are still living there and their sexual choices are impacting your life in your own home. You did not consent to live with a thruple. You did not consent to having a stranger move in.", "NTA", "NTA. Your parents put you in an incredibly uncomfortable position and then try to shame you for not being open minded enough.

If you are more comfortable living with your grandparents than that's the best thing for you.\nEdit: not wanting to live in a house with a throuple is not the same as disapproving of it. \nI don't want to live in a house with six cats, but I don't  disapprove of cats in general at all.", "NTA- this is their lifestyle choice and they can\u2019t call you a bigot and stress you to accept them as a throuple. \n\nHonestly, leaving you 100% out of it would\u2019ve been more appropriate.", "NTA. When inviting a new person into your family home, they should have consulted you and respected your feelings. On the one hand, I fully support people exploring alternative family structures, poly relationships, and whatever other consensual romantic, financial, and domestic relationships are fulfilling to them... ***HOWEVER*** your parents have failed to realize that a key part of cultivating a *consensual domestic relationship* is that it also has to be consensual for you. They did not seek your consent in this matter, which is honestly basic poly protocol and they should know better than to have done that in the first place, let alone shame you for clearly holding boundaries for what you were comfortable with. It's understandable, that as a 16 year old, you aren't yet used to or comfortable thinking about your parents as sexual beings. That's fine and they should respect that too.\n\nFrankly, your parents should be proud of you for honoring your own comfort, advocating for yourself, and arranging for a healthy and safe alternative living situation. This speaks to your maturity and clear thinking in a difficult situation, things which will serve you well in college.

Absolutely have a firm talk with them making it VERY clear she\u2019s not your parent, and you don\u2019t answer to her as one.

Live where you are made a priority. \n\nI\u2019m all for people living their life however they want as long as it doesn\u2019t hurt someone else.

The fact that they\u2019re shaming you for feeling like you\u2019ve been out in an awkward situation is so ridiculous. Their job as parents is literally to create a safe and beneficial environment for you, and they\u2019re actively ignoring your requests for that. \n\nPlease please look out for yourself and do not hesitate to let others in your life know what is going on, including counselors at school. They\u2019ll need to be informed of your change of address anyways, and should know why you\u2019ve moved.", "NTA they can wait two fucking years to live out their poly dreams if you're not comfortable with it.", "NTA", "NTA - why do these worthless people have kids?! We\u2019re moving our lover in because she\u2019s more important than you. Ask them why tf they bothered having children if they only care about themselves.", "NTA.

They've only really been with this woman a few months, and they're moving her in already? That's way too fast!

Harsh but not impossible.", "I'm appalled at their behaviour. They are fundamentally changing the family unit and this change would be as difficult for you to handle as, say, a divorce.

The way they explained it to me, she's their \"3rd partner\" I guess it's some poly thing IDK I don't follow that stuff. I guess they're still married and all that, but she's more like a \"secondary\" partner.\n\nThe last few months were weird, but I was managing. They'd warn me in advance if she was coming over, or if they were going to her place. I could handle that, but what was awkward is that in the mornings after, she's usually still there. It's a little freaky getting ready for school and making small talk when you know why they're here.\n\nHer visits were getting more and more common, and my parents wanted to have a talk with me, she's moving in. The spare room will be her room, and they'll all live together as a throuple. I don't think I can handle that, it's just too weird, especially since she's closer to my age than theirs.\n\nNow she's friendly enough, but it's still weird, like she's halfway between family friend and stepmom. It's not any one thing really, it's just that the whole situation is just too much too fast for me. My grandparents live nearby and I'm always welcome to stay there, so I told my parents I'm just gonna live with them at least until I finish school.  \n\nThey didn't take it well. They think I hate them and I'm not being open minded. I explained I still love them and I want to live with them, but on top of being uncomfortable I don't want to explain to my friends who the young woman who lives in our spare room is. Plus I admit, it really does gross me out when I see this woman being affectionate with my parents (They never do anything inappropriate in front of me, but still)\n\nThey said I was being bigoted and that they were disappointed in me, but let me go and said my room will be waiting for me. Now I fell awful and wonder if maybe I should've just kept my head down until college.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

In my experience on Reddit, these types of situations never turn out great.

You can be as open minded as you like, and you be totally respectful of people who are lgbtq+ and people who are non binary or into polyamory etc, but when it's YOUR PARENTS, who you've only known as a manogomous married couple all your life, its a huge change to expect you to be comfortable with having a 3rd person in your family, and knowing that your parents are sleeping with her, and are basically adding a step mum to your family. \n\nYou have every right to feel uncomfortable about it, and feel uneasy about her being there in the house when you wake up in the mornings, and you can especially feel uncomfortable.fortable with having her move in and be a constant presence in your day to day life. Not to mention not wanting your friends to know about the situation for fear of how they may react or how others may treat you. \n\nAt the end of the day, they should have continually talked to you about this at different stages, to make sure you were comfortable with it. Although I know as adults they have every right to do what they want to do with their private and romantic lives, BUT, as PARENTS, their 1st responsibility and commitment is to YOU, and making sure you feel safe, secure and comfortable with any of these changes. And let's be honest, they could wait a couple more years till you're old enough to either go off to uni and can stay with your grandparents when on break from uni, or till you're at least 18 and finished school and can either move out to your grandparents then or get your own place etc. They didn't have to do this whilst your 16 and still at school and going through a lot of major things, like exams and possibly doing A levels or going to college etc. They could have waited just a couple more years till you're legally an adult. They could have continued just seeing her at her place. Rather than totally disrupt your family life and force you to be in a situation you are uncomfortable with. \n\nIt's got nothing to do with having an open mind or being bigoted, that's out of order for them to guilt trip you and manipulate you in that way. They are the adults and should be setting a responsible example. Would they be happy with you sleeping with multiple partners? I don't think so. \n\nI would either... move in with your grandparents so you can concentrate on your own life and feel comfortable in your own (grandparents) home, or ...\n\nTalk to your parents and explain how you feel, like the points I've mentioned above, and you can explain that you'd rather they keep things discrete at least till you're 18, so you are able to stay living with them in your own home, comfortably, with your parents, and they visit her at her place, and possibly the occasional day time visits at your place but not sleep overs. And then when you're 18, and going to uni they can do what they want then. But whilst you're a minor, it's their responsibility to take care of you as your parents without putting you in an uncomfortable living environment. To be honest I don't know what child services would make of the situation, and if they would feel its a suitable living environment for a minor. But they meed to realise that you should be their priority, and once you're an adult and old enough to live elsewhere etc, then they can do what they want without it being in your face all the time. \n\nNTA.

It would probably be helpful for you to look up information about poly relationships and throuples. It's actually more common than people know.

If these parents were moving in someone that WAS NOT a sexual or emotional partner, such as a family friend or relative, and the daughter expressed discomfort I would STILL say that they are selfish for not taking her feelings into account. It\u2019s not about the daughter being \u201cdisgusted\u201d with their life-style, it\u2019s about her being uncomfortable with the partner that she barely knows moving into her home. The daughter doesn\u2019t seem to specifically care that her parents are seeing the woman, only that they are bringing her into their home, and since she lives there too she should be able to express her discomfort. She was also mature enough to remove herself from the situation because she wasn\u2019t comfortable and didn\u2019t want to force them to change their minds. There is no moral blasphemy, only bad parenting.", "Not who you responded to but i agree with them. I wouldn't say it's more blasphemous to my morality if it's a third person vs a new partner after a divorce.\n\nBut that doesn't change the fact that such things should be gently introduced to children, give them time to process it and make sure they feel comfortable in their own home. New parental figures in your home are always difficult and take time to get used to. The fact that your parents have become poly and found a third partner is also a huge life change and i can see how it could be hard to deal with so much of it so suddenly.\n\nI'm fine with all kinds of relationships, love whoever and however you want as long as everyone is happy. But throwing a 16 year old in the middle of a poly relationship with essentially no warnings and having them move in so quickly after meeting them is not okay. Parents should have at least talked to OP to see how they feel about it before announcing that some woman he has seen a few times is now moving in.", "I\u2019m not judging the morality of it.

Not having that partner live with them is a reasonable accommodation to make for their child\u2019s comfort. It isn\u2019t forever, but while their child lives with them, that should matter most. That doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t engage in that relationship, or even that the partner couldn\u2019t eventually move in. \n\nRight now their kid says they aren\u2019t comfortable, so they should wait.", "Because in OP\u2019s eyes that\u2019s what this is.

People risk their kids over fuck buddies and new relationships all the freaking time. You sound very naive in this perspective. \n\nParents are people, and even if they happen to have the same choices in life as you do (poly, in this case) that doesn't magically stop them from doing shitty things to their own child. \n\nYou're doing poly people a disservice blindly defending two people clearly in the wrong who are not taking the very valid feelings of their own child into consideration.

I think most of us would be saying the same thing if it was a single parent in a monogamous relationship.  That house was the child\u2019s home before that person entered the picture.  They should feel safe there.  A parent shouldn\u2019t be moving someone in when their child is so uncomfortable that they\u2019re thinking about moving out.  You sign up for parenthood and your child\u2019s health, safety and comfort should be number one priority.

The post is about how the choices of the parents have changed the life of their child.\n\nEdited for spelling.", "Yeah, I don't think there's anything wrong with poly, just OP's parents went about this in one of the worst way possible, when their daughter was actually trying to be understanding and patience with the change.\n\nThis reminds me of one of the post that shows up on Best of redditors update, where the teenage girl's mom came out as lesbian, divorced, and remarried her wife. The girl was having a hard time because of how the mom dropped her cold for her new life, but anytime the girl try to talk to her mom about it, the mom made it seem like it was about her being gay and her daughter not accepting her.\n\nThem being poly isn't the problem here. It's about them being disrespectful to their daughter's living situation/comfort, and also calling her names when they don't get their way.

Huh, interesting...", "I agree with you.\n\nI'm also saying that the decision is not based on solely sexual desires.
