{"id": 1182, "submission_id": "ym0a8q", "title": "AITA for wanting my bf to come home for some days while his uncle is in hospital", "selftext": "Me and my bf live together for about 3 years. Last week it turned out one of his 9 uncles needs to undergo a serious heart surgery. He comes from a big village in the mountains. The surgery was performed in a larger city, 2 hrs away from ours. My bf is currently working as a physiotherapist, but is putting his graduation off. This means his salary is not quite optimal until he has the document from his university.\n\nThe surgery was on my graduation day, so my bf was in this other city. I graduated as a screenwriter, which is not a well-paid job and I am basically still writing for free until I establish myself. In the meantime I am working 3 jobs that have little to nothing to do with my profession in order to earn money. I am considering quitting one of the jobs to pursue my actual profession. But I cannot count on his income to balance things out for now.\n\nNow it's been a week, his uncle is in the intensive care unit and meetings with relatives are not exactly allowed, but my bf stays there in constant tries to see him and occasionally brings some stuff for the uncle. But not every day. He's staying in his cousin's appartment, who is on a trip in Dubai for a week. She'll be back tomorrow.\n\nWhen I asked if he would come home once the cousin is back, he refused, because the cousin has to go to work. He is currently not going to work. The cousin is working in a restaurant. He has a huge family and not a single one of them ever offered to stay in the city do that he can go to work at least for a little. I told him I don't think it's fair of them to expect that he does everything. The uncle himself has no wife or kids, but has 8 brothers and 3 sisters. None of them have an important job. His mom went in there for 2 days and coming home while she's there never crossed his mind.\n\nMy mom and grandma expressed concern that he will not be able to pay his part of the rent and said that they would not be okay with me paying for everything. \n\nWhen I tried to talk to him about that he said that I am not being supportive at all. When I told him that it's wrong of his family to not even ask if he would manage to pay rent, he just said \"I will pay.\"(clearly implying that I am shaming him or that I demand the money in a rude way)\n\nI do feel guilty for wanting more help, but at the same time feel like I am not a priority on his list at all. I truly hope his uncle is fine, but taking phone calls with doctors and worried relatives could be done from home. And he could always make one-day trips to the other city to see him (the meetings last no more than 2 mins). Meeting him IS important so that his uncle knows he's loved, but I think this commitment should be distributed between all family members. And I do need help and support in my relationship. I feel like he doesn't think about me at all and feels like I am only getting in his way with my selfishness.
