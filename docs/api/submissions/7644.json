I gave him a slightly higher salary than entry-level employees and hired him (I hired him as a trainee, but full-time). He seemed to be very pleased and happy.\n\nI gave him work to just go through a few documents which would hardly take 2 hours regarding the work. Although if a person is slow should be done in 1 working day considering the first half was the introduction etc.\n\nHe took 1 week(5 business days) to complete the work. I kept asking him, but he was responding saying that the work was in progress. I did make sure to mention multiple times that he can reach out to me or anyone on the team for help in front of others.\n\nAfter a week, I gave him work C which was a part of both his JD & contract. He was working on it at a tortoise's pace and his output was bad. I showed him how to do it and explained him and asked him to proceed further. He mailed me on the 9th(technically 8, because he was on leave for one day) day that he is comfortable with work A and he will only do that.

But, I cannot work with someone who is not willing to work or at least ask for help if they are not understanding. He didn't reply back, there was silence for 10 minutes. He wasn't looking at me. I told him to leave immediately and I made sure to emphasize that I am removing him from this job because he is not incapable, but because he wasn't willing to work. I literally was feeling bad because I don't want to break his confidence, I was trying to be authoritative but not harsh.\n\nDid I handle the situation right? Could I have done it better? Am I an AH? Are there any mistakes that I have done?\n\nEdit: he wanted to do all task As in the company. Task A is analyzing work B.

Week 1 at any job is never a highly-productive time for anyone. Adding to this, listen to the way this employer speaks to the employee: after 5 working days, tells them to quit and then only a few business days later tells them they can just hire a contractor to do the work. This isn't how you cultivate an environment of performance. It is, however, how you create an environment of fear.\n\nThis employer is an asshole to think this is 1) how you effectively motivate employees and 2) get any modicum of performance out of them. \"Do it or quit\" is quite literally the definition of a task-obsessed master.\n\nThe employee didn't \"refuse\", that's how a shitty employer interpreted it. The employee showed a preference for certain work given the stipulated timeline, which you have all done at some point. The evaluation they made was \"I have x amount of days to do something, I am only given a short amount of time to do all of these tasks, so I prefer the one I can complete in the time given.\" You all literally do this type of evaluation both at work and home everyday.
