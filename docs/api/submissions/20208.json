I work nights and get home at 8 am. When I get home, I\u2019m not driving my kid around to go see her friends, I\u2019m sleeping. When she was younger we had an au pair for this kind of thing, over the past year we\u2019ve had an agreement that she can go wherever she wants after I get home as long as she can get there on foot or on her bike and she stays in our town. This agreement works because she\u2019s been able to prove that I can trust her over the years. I also have a tracker on her phone that alerts me when she leaves town. \n\nMy sister asked me to babysit her kids (14f, 12m) last weekend while they went to a wedding. I warned them that I would be working those days and will not be taking their kids anywhere until at least 4pm and that I\u2019m not going to let them go out into town. They seemed fine with that until Saturday morning. I came home from work, made me and the kids breakfast, and Juliana left the house. \n\nMy niece asked why Juliana gets to go out and they don\u2019t and I said it\u2019s because she\u2019s been able to prove that I can trust her and I have the tracker on her phone. They are not with me long enough for me to be able to trust them to wander around town and since I do not own their phones I can\u2019t put trackers on them. The kids woke me up multiple times that day to take them places because they were bored then their parents started calling me because I can\u2019t let my daughter go out and not my nieces and nephews and I should\u2019ve called in sick if I couldn\u2019t let my niece or nephew do anything fun because of my work. Sunday was the same. I did not take them out either day because if they won\u2019t respect me, I\u2019m not going to take them out, which their parents also got mad about. \n\nMy sister and parents are upset that I locked the kids in the house all weekend but let Juliana do whatever she wants. They\u2019re saying to be fair I should\u2019ve let all of the kids go out or none and are calling me a bad aunt.

Yet her sister trusts them, so why wouldn't she let them go out after learning that? She was clearly being petty. \n\nAlso, if the reason for not having them all go out together is that the daughter didn't want the nephews to tag along, that's fine, but thats not what OP said.\n\n>It sucks that the kids parents ditched them in the country for one whole weekend.

Pretty sure that's why she stuck them with the aunt in the country.\n\nWhat I did see was demands to not let her own daughter go, because that annoyed their kids, and that she should have called into work sick so she had the time and energy to run the kids around for the weekend.\n\n>Also, if the reason for not having them all go out together is that the daughter didn't want the nephews to tag along, that's fine, but thats not what OP said.\n\nActually she does say in a comment how her daughter is not fond of her cousins and is likely bailing especially to get away from them.\n\n>It only sucks because she's a bad aunt, they could have had a great time.\n\nYeah if she wanted to call in sick and devote a weekend not to resting up from being so tired, but instead devoting it to bring a fun aunt.

Idk what else to tell you.", ">Actually she does say in a comment how her daughter is not fond of her cousins and is likely bailing especially to get away from them.\n\nWell that kind of changes everything, it would've been nice to mention that. Personally I would encourage my kids to be good hosts and spend more time with their cousins out of respect even if they don't *really* like them, but that doesn't really apply if the daughter is literally trying to get away from them.\n\nI'll take back what I said about OP being a bad aunt. I just feel bad for the kids, they had a shit weekend and didn't really do anything to deserve it.

My parents raised me especially to speak up if I felt that I was being treated unfair.

So my parents actively make the choice to not repeat their parents mistakes.

They are not your kids, you don't know them well enough to even know trusted friends/parents, usual places they go, their usual behaviour in general etc. This seems like a no brainer to me, and if their actual parents want to judge and dictate such things then why ask anyone else to babysit in the first place? Even if the parents gave you a rundown of these things above that are ok and trusted/not; it's still up to you as the one watching over them to decide if your comfortable going off what the parents have said or not, seen as you'd still be ultimately responsible either way, they should respect your position in this situation as childminder, and not just the perks of it.

My bet is that mum said yes just so she could offload the kids, and figured she could bully you into doing what she wanted over the phone. (Or that you would fold when the kids got insistent.) \n\nGood on you for doing neither of those things!\n\n\n>I should\u2019ve called in sick\n\nThis part really annoys me.

You keep doing you!", "Im going for slight YTA which I know is against the majority. You dont know them, but their mother does. All it needed surely was a conversation with their mum prior to dropping off? Questions should have been asked like are they allowed to go into town? Do they have trackers on their phones and if its a no thats enough. I dont have trackers on my sons phone, never have and Id be mighty annoyed if someone decided he couldnt go out because of no tracker despite it being ok with me. You basically made two teens stay inside for the weekend, one who at 14 is more than capable of being outside with no tracker rather than asking her mum what her rules were for when the kids are out. Doesnt matter if its different to what you do", "I think you were right not letting the kids leave, but I also feel your daughter should\u2019ve stayed home too... You trust her, she could\u2019ve helped with the kids while you slept...", "YTA. I started with everyone sucking but then realized that OP effectively overrode parental permission to let their kids go outside. It\u2019s annoying to be woken multiple times after a night shift but also it sounds like OP literally insisted on a teen and almost teen staying indoors all day for no good reason. Certainly OP would not have fielded multiple calls from the parents if she wasn\u2019t overruling them.\n\nIf I sent my kids to hang at their aunt\u2019s even if the aunt notes that she\u2019s going to be sleeping all day I would have expected the other kid in the house to be present to hang with her cousins. If the house is empty of people who are awake then I agree with your family - dunno why you wouldn\u2019t have let the other kids go out with your daughter. If you didn\u2019t trust them alone then ask them to stick together.\n\nIncidentally good cousin relationships don\u2019t form by magic; they do need to spend time together to have one.\n\nBut ultimately OP is the A because whether or not the kids are trustworthy is a parental judgment thing and she\u2019s not their parent.", "ESH (you a tiny bit, them a lot)\n\nIt\u2019s easier for kids to do things when they think it\u2019s fair, much less so when they think it isn\u2019t. \n\nThey (your sister and her kids) probably were expecting for this one weekend when her cousins were in town she would want to do stuff with them. While she isn\u2019t the host, she sort of is and ignoring guests visiting sucks. (Maybe they see each other often and this is less of a thing) Having your kid be polite and \u2018entertain guests\u2019 would have been a good opportunity to learn social norms. \n\nYes you were clear they shouldn\u2019t wake you up. \nYes you were clear you\u2019d be working. \nI don\u2019t think you were clear your daughter would be gone and her kids not allowed to go with. This is probably the one thing that caused friction.", "YTA, their parents say it's okay for them to go out.\nAnything that happens to them when they go out is the parents' responsibility.", "ESH", "Is this a cultural thing?

You, your niece and nephew don\u2019t. They can do whatever they want when they are with their parents.", "NTA.

Or she could also leave them at your mother's house who is right about everything about this matter.", "Nta they were warned", "NTA\n\nAs the baby sister in the family, my brother and sister had freedoms I hadn't earned yet. Your daughter shouldn't have to be responsible for them. Your brother has no say on how you raise your daughter. They knew the deal. It was their responsibility to make sure they packed enough stuff for their children to be entertained. Also...we never knocked on Mom's door when she was sleeping unless it was an emergency! Mom was a nurse and sleep was important! What kind of disrespect is that?", "NTA - why would they ask you to babysit if they know you are working those days. they probably thought Juliana would be there to provide entertainment.", "NTA\n\nYou let them know you\u2019d be working and wouldn\u2019t be taking the kids anywhere.

You acted appropriately under the circumstances.", "To each his/her own. Personally I drive my grandchildren where they want to go. I meet the parents or grandparents. I check for registered sex offenders in that proximity. I don't let them go anywhere by themselves on a  Bicycle that's for damn sure. Hell just 6 months or so ago a FedEx driver kidnapped a child in her long driveway raped her and murdered her. And yes that wasn't far from us.\n\nWe don't do sleepovers. And yes I check the backgrounds of any children's parents my grandkids want to go visit or play with. If you want to be a head in the sand parent or grandparent knock your lights out. Yes we use tracking devices too. But not just a cellphone as a matter of fact we use multiple trackers per child.", "NTA. If you let them go out and sth happen, your mom and sister will blame you for sure. Moreover, you did warn her that you will have to work and won\u2019t be available to take the kids out. The audacity, did your sister give you any money? Call in sick to assist her kids\u2019 tantrum, hell no. When my parents ask someone (either my aunts/uncles or my 10+ yrs older cousin) to babysit me, they gave them money, about 15 times of a minimum wage per day back then. If they take me out, my parents cover their foods and whatever activities I chose to do as well. If I wanna watch movie, tickets are all on my parents. Seems like your sister did none of that.", "I'm just wondering what job a single parent does at night that can pay for an au pair", "YTA, but only if you take your daughter out for ice cream and don't bring back any for the others. #sharethetreats", "NTA", "Whenever my mom and dad left with me with any of my uncles' or aunts' houses, they never failed to remind me that it's their house so it will be their rules.  They'd tell me to suck it up if things are different from how it's at home unless they show any disrespect to me or my siblings.

You have a long-standing amount of trust with your daughter. You don't have trackers on their phone either. You don't know if you can trust the other kids, if you let them go and something happened, you would be blamed and called a bad aunt, so in this instance, it is a lose lose situation. \n\nWhat you could possibly have done as a compromise. Is to say they can go out with your daughter, but they must stay with her. Then, you can still track them. You know they are with a responsible person, and your daughter could call if they left her or if there was an issue. It might have been a good compromise if your daughter didn't mind. \n\nAt the end of the day, you made your position clear, and you love them and don't want them to go missing, get hurt, etc. You're doing an amazing job not only as a mother (your daughter is testament to that) but also as an aunt.

They knew in advance she was working.\nThe audacity!!!!\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThere is also a big difference between letting out a 15 year old who knows the areas and a 12 year old who's not a resident in the area. \n\nLike the comments above said, OP knows their daughter, they interact with them daily, there is a trust and bond there, there is daily rules and expectations. \n\nFor the niece and nephew, they don't live the same life, they don't know the rules or boundaries. \n\nFor the parents, they clearly just fobbed the kids off on you. They heard you, you said words, they nodded along and said \"yes, yes of course\" but they never actually listened to you. They wanted someone to watch the kids, didn't care who, what or when, just do whatever and don't bother us.", "Agreed OP\u2019s sister knows her work schedule, and the sister agreed to her kids not going out til 4pm.  Yet these teenagers woke up their aunt cause they were likely pissed their cousin could go out - Asshole behaviour. \n\nBut the main Asshole is the sister for  calling OP a bad aunt.  It was the sister\u2019s responsibility to explain the babysitting arrangement to her kids about not going out and to respect it! \n\nOP NTA", "The fact that these parents think a 12 and 14 year old need adult supervision for a weekend could be pretty telling of their character as well. Could be helicopter parents... Or could be these kids are prone to trouble.", "Something I\u2019m also baffled about, at 12-14, you telling me these kids couldn\u2019t work out themselves how to entertain themselves for a few days?\n\nDon\u2019t most kids grow out of the \u201cI\u2019m bored and it\u2019s your job to fix it\u201d phase by the time they\u2019re 9-10?", "No, you are not the AITA here.", "I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t go out anyway.

Consequences.\n\nThey were told auntie needed sleep because she was still working that weekend.  They were told why it was different for their older cousin.  They were told going out later in the afternoon was possible.\n\nThen they proceeded to act like spoiled, entitled brats, and their parents backed them!\n\nOP should definitely never help her sister out with free babysitting ever again. Grammy can deal with the free labor, since she's got opinions, too.", ">That was a little mean, they are only kids after all.\n\nRight. OP should just, use up her PTO if she has any, on kids she is watching for free. Not like that is meant for when she wants to relax or her/her kid is sick or there's a medical emergency. Not like she bills to pay. \n\nOr she could say screw sleeping, stay awake the entire time so she won't have to use up her PTO and potentially get someone killed for driving the kids around with 0 sleep. \n\nOr they can understand that the world doesn't revolve around them and find ways to entertain themselves. At age 10, I was able to entertain myself and I didn't have access to the internet, a cell phone and couldn't leave my backyard. And boredom is painful for me so damn right I would be finding ways to not die of boredom. \n\nCongratulations, I now feel old (\ud83d\ude2d) but like I have made my point anyway. With modern day privileges, there is so much they could be doing to be patient for their time out of the house. It isn't mean to be responsible. It's life. The sooner they learn that, the better off they will be. If they want to blame someone, they should blame their parents for accepting OP's terms.", "I agree. Unless they are completely incapable it's not unreasonable to let a 14 year old out without supervision. Also I'd argue that this was foreseeable? If one teenager is let out then the others would want to go out too. Surely a better solution could have been found", "They did talk before hand, OP told her sister that she would need the kids to let her sleep, that they would not be permitted to go into town, and that she would be available to drive them places from 4pm.\n\nSister agreed with all this, she knew what OP had planned. She said yes to everything then changed her mind as soon as the kids were out of her hands. As for the comment on calling in sick... That can get you fired.", "My initial reaction (before I read the whole post) was that maybe OP could have asked her daughter to hang around at home to spend time with her cousins to avoid all of this.\n\nThen I read about the niece and nephew crossing boundaries and thought it was only fair that they felt the consequences of their actions. Also she was doing her sister a favour by watching them. They should all abide by her rules and boundaries whilst in her house.", "I honestly thought I was the only person that thought this.

There aren't babies.", "So...exactly what op did?", "Juliana didn't volunteer to babysit. Her mother did.  And her mother was clear with the kids' parents about what that would look like.\n\nThe kids' parents should have punished them for being little turdlings by blowing up their phones all weekend during their getaway and by not letting their aunt sleep.

Kid gets hit by a car, or has a medical episode; kid finds themselves lost and panics, parents can find them without the child having to explain where they are; peace of mind because parent can see they haven't gone to trouble spots like a bar or playing on the railway tracks. All more likely than stranger danger, in truth.  The parent has at least some idea of what they have been up to.
