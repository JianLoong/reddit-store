I work nights and get home at 8 am. When I get home, I\u2019m not driving my kid around to go see her friends, I\u2019m sleeping. When she was younger we had an au pair for this kind of thing, over the past year we\u2019ve had an agreement that she can go wherever she wants after I get home as long as she can get there on foot or on her bike and she stays in our town. This agreement works because she\u2019s been able to prove that I can trust her over the years. I also have a tracker on her phone that alerts me when she leaves town. \n\nMy sister asked me to babysit her kids (14f, 12m) last weekend while they went to a wedding. I warned them that I would be working those days and will not be taking their kids anywhere until at least 4pm and that I\u2019m not going to let them go out into town. They seemed fine with that until Saturday morning. I came home from work, made me and the kids breakfast, and Juliana left the house. \n\nMy niece asked why Juliana gets to go out and they don\u2019t and I said it\u2019s because she\u2019s been able to prove that I can trust her and I have the tracker on her phone. They are not with me long enough for me to be able to trust them to wander around town and since I do not own their phones I can\u2019t put trackers on them. The kids woke me up multiple times that day to take them places because they were bored then their parents started calling me because I can\u2019t let my daughter go out and not my nieces and nephews and I should\u2019ve called in sick if I couldn\u2019t let my niece or nephew do anything fun because of my work. Sunday was the same. I did not take them out either day because if they won\u2019t respect me, I\u2019m not going to take them out, which their parents also got mad about. \n\nMy sister and parents are upset that I locked the kids in the house all weekend but let Juliana do whatever she wants. They\u2019re saying to be fair I should\u2019ve let all of the kids go out or none and are calling me a bad aunt.

Yet her sister trusts them, so why wouldn't she let them go out after learning that? She was clearly being petty. \n\nAlso, if the reason for not having them all go out together is that the daughter didn't want the nephews to tag along, that's fine, but thats not what OP said.\n\n>It sucks that the kids parents ditched them in the country for one whole weekend.

Pretty sure that's why she stuck them with the aunt in the country.\n\nWhat I did see was demands to not let her own daughter go, because that annoyed their kids, and that she should have called into work sick so she had the time and energy to run the kids around for the weekend.\n\n>Also, if the reason for not having them all go out together is that the daughter didn't want the nephews to tag along, that's fine, but thats not what OP said.\n\nActually she does say in a comment how her daughter is not fond of her cousins and is likely bailing especially to get away from them.\n\n>It only sucks because she's a bad aunt, they could have had a great time.\n\nYeah if she wanted to call in sick and devote a weekend not to resting up from being so tired, but instead devoting it to bring a fun aunt.

Idk what else to tell you.", ">Actually she does say in a comment how her daughter is not fond of her cousins and is likely bailing especially to get away from them.\n\nWell that kind of changes everything, it would've been nice to mention that. Personally I would encourage my kids to be good hosts and spend more time with their cousins out of respect even if they don't *really* like them, but that doesn't really apply if the daughter is literally trying to get away from them.\n\nI'll take back what I said about OP being a bad aunt. I just feel bad for the kids, they had a shit weekend and didn't really do anything to deserve it.

My parents raised me especially to speak up if I felt that I was being treated unfair.

So my parents actively make the choice to not repeat their parents mistakes.

They are not your kids, you don't know them well enough to even know trusted friends/parents, usual places they go, their usual behaviour in general etc. This seems like a no brainer to me, and if their actual parents want to judge and dictate such things then why ask anyone else to babysit in the first place? Even if the parents gave you a rundown of these things above that are ok and trusted/not; it's still up to you as the one watching over them to decide if your comfortable going off what the parents have said or not, seen as you'd still be ultimately responsible either way, they should respect your position in this situation as childminder, and not just the perks of it.

It is not healthy to be sedentary all day, glued to electronics, and it is understandable that they would be miserable. Outside enrichment *is* important, and they deserve better than being locked in the house all day. Knowing this, OP had no place offering to babysit at all.", "It is simply not acceptable to force kids to be sedentary all day. 4pm is nearly the end of the afternoon and a lot of businesses would have been closed by then anyways, and it may even be close to dark in some places. OP is still the asshole regardless, because she thought it was acceptable to offer to take them in when she clearly could not look after them if she's not available for the majority of the day. I wouldn't be surprised if they snuck out on their own out of boredom.", "She should not have agreed in the first place.", "Keeping them inside as punishment for asking to go outside yesterday is extreme and disproportionate. If they\u2019d broken a rule like sneaking out, sure, but their crime was being annoying. If kids are nagging her bc they\u2019re bored, maybe OP and her kid should\u2019ve acted more like they were hosting family instead of some transient pests.", "So again, you're referring to her parameters that she clearly laid out before the sister agreed to have them stay there, right? Kinda danced around that one so....\n\n4pm is not \"nearly the end of the day\" and this suddenly becoming your issue is nothing but transparent. How about we stay on topic, yeah?", "\u201cWhy should she have to?\u201d\n\nBecause her cousins were staying with her and her mom\u2019s busy. I can\u2019t believe \u201cpolitely entertain your family/houseguests\u201d is a controversial take.", "OP should not have *offered at all* knowing her parameters. Because of this, she is not faultless, regardless of what the sister agreed to. For kids especially, being stuck inside the house until 4pm is actually a really long time, that's like 7-8 hours, which is just not acceptable.", "Quoting from the post: \"I warned them that I would be working those days and will not be taking their kids anywhere until at least 4pm and that I\u2019m not going to let them go out into town. They seemed fine with that until Saturday morning.\"\n\nI don't know what would make it more clear than that.", "Telling that *her* kid (who is almost the same age as the older one) would still be going out and about freely. That should have alerted the sister to discuss the rules with OP or to have a talk with her kids about it if they didn't have other options. It's important that kids understand and don't feel like they have just some unfair and arbitrary rules imposed on them.", "NTA. What kind of spoiled, entitled niece and nephew are these. You are not obligated to do or take them anywhere. You are overseeing their safety, feeding them, etc. SO NTA!", "The best part of this is they likely won't ever ask her to watch their kids again, because OP can say, same rules as last time. The parents only got mad because their child free weekend was interrupted.", "NTA AT ALL!! If they want their kids to go out they can take them out themselves", "My 8yo does this, ugh. So you\u2019re telling me it\u2019s gonna take longer?!", "Umm, in most places, legally, leaving kids that age alone for a weekend would be a charge of child neglect!", "I mean, I definitely grew out of it by 8-9, but that\u2019s because I discovered video games and the internet. xD", "Or the sister could have found someone else to watch them when OP told her she was going to be working and therefore asleep during the day and not taking them anywhere", "Hahaha, my kids addicted to his switch and iPad. He\u2019s only bored when he doesn\u2019t have electronics \ud83e\udd23", "Not to mention that if the cousins don't live in the same town than they may not be familiar with the area and who knows what could have happened. I think OP was being very careful here.", "In charge if other kids? And over night?  That like,y wasn\u2019t legal! And IAAL!"]}
