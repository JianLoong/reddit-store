I work nights and get home at 8 am. When I get home, I\u2019m not driving my kid around to go see her friends, I\u2019m sleeping. When she was younger we had an au pair for this kind of thing, over the past year we\u2019ve had an agreement that she can go wherever she wants after I get home as long as she can get there on foot or on her bike and she stays in our town. This agreement works because she\u2019s been able to prove that I can trust her over the years. I also have a tracker on her phone that alerts me when she leaves town. \n\nMy sister asked me to babysit her kids (14f, 12m) last weekend while they went to a wedding. I warned them that I would be working those days and will not be taking their kids anywhere until at least 4pm and that I\u2019m not going to let them go out into town. They seemed fine with that until Saturday morning. I came home from work, made me and the kids breakfast, and Juliana left the house. \n\nMy niece asked why Juliana gets to go out and they don\u2019t and I said it\u2019s because she\u2019s been able to prove that I can trust her and I have the tracker on her phone. They are not with me long enough for me to be able to trust them to wander around town and since I do not own their phones I can\u2019t put trackers on them. The kids woke me up multiple times that day to take them places because they were bored then their parents started calling me because I can\u2019t let my daughter go out and not my nieces and nephews and I should\u2019ve called in sick if I couldn\u2019t let my niece or nephew do anything fun because of my work. Sunday was the same. I did not take them out either day because if they won\u2019t respect me, I\u2019m not going to take them out, which their parents also got mad about. \n\nMy sister and parents are upset that I locked the kids in the house all weekend but let Juliana do whatever she wants. They\u2019re saying to be fair I should\u2019ve let all of the kids go out or none and are calling me a bad aunt.

Never never never.\n\nFrom now on, let mommy deal with them.", "Your sister: you should let my kids wander round town; they\u2019re totally trustworthy \n\nThe kids: keep waking you up because they cannot follow an incredibly simple instruction of \u201cdon\u2019t wake me\u201d while I\u2019m sleeping after work \n\nThose two things don\u2019t make sense together. \n\nIf I was responsible for a 12 year old who couldn\u2019t follow a very basic rule then I absolutely wouldn\u2019t feel safe letting them wander around without adult supervision.", "NTA.  Being responsible for your own kid is one thing.  You have a proven agreement and it works. Being responsible for other children is different. I would have let them do whatever they wanted once their ignorant unappreciative parents called to complain about the free babysitting. And calling out is beyond their place to suggest.", "\n\nNo, you are not the AITA here. You set reasonable restrictions for all of the kids - they all needed to stay where you were until you went to sleep and out of town trips were out of the question. You established trust with your daughter, which allowed her to stay out when you were asleep - the nieces and nephews had been with you for a short period of time and you had no way of verifying their whereabouts. You were willing to take the kids out once you got some rest, but they were not respectful of your needs, and you rightfully chose to not take them anywhere.

But I will say is you should have at least planned something for them to do while you slept. Say up a game give the something to do instead of just making them entertain themselves for hours. \n\nThe main reason is that you punished the kids because they were bored and woke you up. You're being petty to kids come on", "I was leaning no until I got to the part about Sunday.   This would be after their parents told you they wanted you to let the kids go out.  They are close in age to your daughter, and it would have been appropriate to tell them they could go with her as long as they all stayed together.  That way, you are doing what your sister asked, and you have the comfort of the trust you have in her.  Instead, you threw a fit and decided to basically punish them for telling their mom.\n\nYTA.", "NTA\n\nYour kid is a known factor. You have trust, and a tracker.

And they're not wildly different in age.  Would it have been such a horrible sacrifice for her to hang out with them at home? Did you even consider asking that?", "Wow I feel bad for your niece and nephew stuck in the house not allowed to do nothing.", "I'm gonna go with YTA. You should never have let them stay given your job and the fact that your daughter is 1 year different in age and you didn't teach her manners. She should have hung out with them. They were guests. \n\nI understand that reddit will disagree but that's how people were raised years ago.", "NTA, you did your sister a favor. They knew the rules.

Have her take her kids with or hire a babysitter who's only job is to care for them", "YTA, your sister is clearly okay with her kids leaving the house, so why aren't you? Do you not trust your sister's judgment when it comes to her own kids? Also yes, you're a bad aunt, the obvious solution is to let all of them leave with your daughter. The good move would be to apologize for your lack of judgment and let them go out. Have some empathy for these kids!", "NTA, you told them in advance.  Let them know that the day care is closed.  They wanted you to skip work then they needed to pay you your lost wages and babysitting Fee.  Better yet send them a bill for watching their gremlins.", "NTA\n\nAnd what if you let them out and they got hit by a car? How would your parents and sister view the situation then?\n\nYou could have taken them out for some of the weekend though. That was a little mean, they are only kids after all.", "And, she told them ahead of time that she was working and needed to sleep during the day! \n\nNTA", "If she had been clear, she would not have gotten a call from her sister.", "I won\u2019t be watching them again", "This. If the parents thought their kids could be trusted wandering around unsupervised, why did they need OP to babysit? They could have just left them home alone and asked her to check in on them once a day. Dumping them on her and expecting her to take time off from work to entertain them, after she told them her terms, was tacky and rude.", "Wrong.\n\nOP laid it out, shitty entitled parents are the AGs.", "Why does the daughter have to alter her plans to become an unpaid babysitter without any notice?\n\nIve read your other comments here so please know that no matter how you respond, I am not going to answer because I'm sure you won't communicate it CLEARLY", "She doesn\u2019t really like her cousins. I wasn\u2019t going to punish her by making her hang out with them just because I agreed to do my sister a favor", ">But these are your kid's cousins, visiting for a weekend. And they're not wildly different in age. Would it have been such a horrible sacrifice for her to hang out with them at home? Did you even consider asking that?\n\nI was considering this as well, but honestly it seems like a punishment to Juliana. This is something my parents would have made me do at that age. I would have been upset.", "Yeah, that sucks sometimes.  Good thing being bored for a weekend is not the end of the world!", "They knew about it before they got here. They could\u2019ve brought something to do.", "Why did you post this 3 times?", "If the sister wants to come out and say that she takes any and all responsibility for whatever her kids get up to, then maybe.\n\nAlso, no, the obvious solution is NOT to force her daughter to have her cousins tag along with whatever her normal social routine is.\n\nIt sucks that the kids parents ditched them in the country for one whole weekend.  Pretty sure they will recover.", "It's all fun and games and trust until something happens with the cousins then it's OPs fault as the adult in charge. My aunt trusts my cousin and I know for a fact she would be so mad at the stuff he gets up to lol", ">I warned them that I would be working those days and will not be taking their kids anywhere until at least 4pm and that I\u2019m not going to let them go out into town.", "Are you really so without imagination that you can't see them all going to a location where they can all have fun without constant direct supervision?  They could go to a park or some other public location where they are \"together \" and not directly involved the whole time.  Everyone trying to say the OP is NTA  seems desperate to ignore the obvious alternatives.", "Mild inconvenience for daughter totally justifies punishing her cousins?", "True to be honest I'm surprised they didn't sneak out.That's what kids my age used to do back in the 90s lol.", "I'm not sure why it posted so many times. I just noticed", "Right, except the reason she didn't let the kids go out is because she hadn't experienced every waking minute of their 14 years of existence, and therefore didn't know if they were mature enough to go out on their own. Yet her sister trusts them, so why wouldn't she let them go out after learning that? She was clearly being petty. \n\nAlso, if the reason for not having them all go out together is that the daughter didn't want the nephews to tag along, that's fine, but thats not what OP said.\n\n>It sucks that the kids parents ditched them in the country for one whole weekend. Pretty sure they will recover.\n\nIt only sucks because she's a bad aunt, they could have had a great time.", "Clearly, that message was not delivered clearly,  or she would not have received that call.  I also doubt the different rules for the cousin were communicated at all.", "Because all the \"obvious solutions\" you have proposed are shitty. OP told the parents that they would be stuck in the house until 4pm. OP has made it CLEAR that her daughter doesn't want to be with her cousins and forcing that situation would be at best unpleasant at worst a punishment.", "And make the 15 yo babysit all weekend?? No way that\u2019s completely unfair. We have tv and the Internet and the two little bastards couldn\u2019t find something to do??", "Reddit was being wonky a couple hours ago", ">Yet her sister trusts them, so why wouldn't she let them go out after learning that? She was clearly being petty.\n\nI didn't see anything from her post that says her sister indicated that she trusts their judgement enough to be let out on their own for the weekend.  Pretty sure that's why she stuck them with the aunt in the country.\n\nWhat I did see was demands to not let her own daughter go, because that annoyed their kids, and that she should have called into work sick so she had the time and energy to run the kids around for the weekend.\n\n>Also, if the reason for not having them all go out together is that the daughter didn't want the nephews to tag along, that's fine, but thats not what OP said.\n\nActually she does say in a comment how her daughter is not fond of her cousins and is likely bailing especially to get away from them.\n\n>It only sucks because she's a bad aunt, they could have had a great time.\n\nYeah if she wanted to call in sick and devote a weekend not to resting up from being so tired, but instead devoting it to bring a fun aunt.  She didn't volunteer to be a fun aunt, she volunteered to make sure the kids were ok and watched over the weekend.", "I'm going off the information provided here, you're making up your own story. Idk what else to tell you.", ">Actually she does say in a comment how her daughter is not fond of her cousins and is likely bailing especially to get away from them.\n\nWell that kind of changes everything, it would've been nice to mention that. Personally I would encourage my kids to be good hosts and spend more time with their cousins out of respect even if they don't *really* like them, but that doesn't really apply if the daughter is literally trying to get away from them.\n\nI'll take back what I said about OP being a bad aunt. I just feel bad for the kids, they had a shit weekend and didn't really do anything to deserve it. OP said she wouldn't do any favors to the kids because they didn't respect her, but that's mostly the sister's fault, not the kids'. I hope OP still took them to fun places after 4pm.", "I'm not making anything up.  She wouldn't let the kids go out, and her sister called her about it.  She can claim she told them anything,  but this was clearly not understood.", "Okay my bad I didn't realize you have ESP. Leave me alone now please.", "JFC...  this isn't complicated. If you CLEARLY communicate something,  you don't get an angry call when you do it.  But you seem to think you have ESP and know the sister understood because.... well, you really don't have a because.", "Oh they heard her loud and clear, They just didn't care until their little darlings began blowing up their phone.", "More of that ESP that has been mentioned.", "NTA. The sister was told her kids were staying put and she agreed. There wasn\u2019t a stipulation that every time Juliana left the house, her kids were also free to leave. Who on earth would let a 12 year old free range these days with no way to check their movements or get in contact with them?! Heck, I barely trust my nephew to look both ways before crossing the road. If the parents are that upset about it, looks like they just volunteered themselves for grandparent duties.", "NTA\n\nMy mom had similar rules with me as a teenager. I could go where I want, when I wanted, as long as I told her about it and kept on top of my other responsibilities (like school). My older brother would complain saying it wasn\u2019t fair since she didn\u2019t do that with him but his grades sucked and he snuck out all the time to get drunk with friends. The most \u201crebellious\u201d thing I did as a teen was drive my friend to McDonald\u2019s for chicken nuggets at 3am because she was too high to drive.\n\nIn other words, I was trustworthy and he wasn\u2019t.", "Your sister sounds entitled she wanted you to loose wages aswell as babysit her kids for free? If she has such an issue tell her to pay a sitter in future and they are old enough to know you needed some rest after working and complaining to their parents shows they are entitled too. As you explained you and your daughter have a mutual and respectful understanding built on trust but also with boundaries in place. They could have disappeared somewhere and you not be able to find them then you\u2019d be to blame for that too. Nta.", "I would point out to your sister that she wasn't concerned enough to come back and rescue her precious angels from the terrible boredom you pre-warned them about. So she can either shut up and say thank you for the favour you did her or she can forget about you babysitting again. NTA.", "Just because you were raised to people being allowed to stomp on your boundaries doesn't mean the rest of us were. My parents raised me especially to speak up if I felt that I was being treated unfair. Then we had an adult conversation about it and came to solution and they did this because they hated that their parents behaved like they owned their children. So my parents actively make the choice to not repeat their parents mistakes. And you know what, because of the way they raised me I love them and respect them not for being my parents but for respecting and loving me and being awesome people. They understand that respect is mutual and eared and that children are not less deserving of it."]}
