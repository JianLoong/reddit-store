No way in the *world* that guy should stay there, and if he doesn't want to pay for a room, how is that even your mom's problem?? Drive, or get his parents to sub him.\n\nOP: NTA. OP's mom, GET REAL!!", "Show it to her. It sounds like you are being emotionally manipulated (them telling you your the bridezilla by being uncomfortable) to get the outcome they want. Stay strong and advocate for yourself and your minor sister.", "NTA . In any way whatsoever. Why not just tell your family that if she has her boyfriend stay in the room that YOU(the actual bride and one of two people the whole weekend is solely about) will be staying at with your fianc\u00e9 at his parents house 50 minutes away and be forced to make that commute yourself. Or your sisters boyfriend(not their child or even family and certainly of NO importance for that weekend) can just not stay and make that same 50 minute commute. And tell them it\u2019s THEIR decision since they are the ones that paid for the room and see what they decide. If they opt for the boyfriend then that says A LOT about them and their parenting/favoritism(just be prepared that it might not go the way I am sure you want). And it already says a whole lot about this situation that your fianc\u00e9 THE GROOM (someone majorly important that weekend) is willing to make the 50 minute drive to be involved with the family time that weekend but no one seems to think your sisters boyfriend should be excepted to. And also what kind of parent is okay with a grown man staying the weekend in the same room as a non-related 15 year old girl? That\u2019s just bad parenting(I don\u2019t care if your sister has been with him for 6 years or 60 years. It\u2019s just not okay).", "Then mom shouldn't be whiny when the bride opts to not stay with her and go to her in law's.\n\nDon't talk your daughter out of renting/using out the suite at the venue, act like its a better option to stay at rhe other place instead and then get angry that the bride doesn't want to wake up next to a stranger she's never met on her wedding day. \n\nThis dude has had 6 years to not do this on his gfs sisters wedding.", "If she visits her big sis at home, she'll most likely not sleep in the same bedroom, and that's the difference. \nSis would most likely sleep in the living room on a couch or in a guest room. At least that's how it's handled where I live.\n\nAlso, if little sis visits big sis, she knows the fiance will be there. He wouldn't get sprung on her suddenly.", "This is between mom and OP. And: it is OP's fault she agreed to stay at mom's room instead of her bridal suite at the venoue. THAT decission has NOTHING to do with her sister and the sister's bf.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"This dude\" is fine to be there, he was invited. And: HE likely does not even know it was not OP's idea.", "Nta.  Tradition, privacy...it's weird she invited him to stay", "No you wouldn't be the AH. If her boyfriend can't find a room to rent, he can sleep outside.\n\n\nEdit: Also, you say your parents aren't a fan of him, yet they're ok with him sleeping in the same room as a 15 yr old?? Hell nah. He can sleep in his car. Or if you want I can call him for you and tell him to sleep elsewhere", "A strange adult man staying in a room with 3 women, one of whom is a minor?  Normally I'm one for abolishing \"girls and boys need to be segregated\" but when theres an age gap of probably 10 years, i'd enforce it this time.\n\nYour wedding, your rules.  YWNBTA", "no, you would not be the asshole.", "NTA", "NTA. He needs to stay somewhere else. Your sister is being selfish.", "NTA If you\u2019re uncomfortable you\u2019re uncomfortable no need to justify just explain that to your sister and I understand that they can\u2019t afford their own room maybe his parents and your parents can split the cost of an independent room for your sister and him", "NTA.  Even the logistics don\u2019t add up. You have 4 people trying to use the bathroom for a big event. It\u2019s one thing when you can leave the bathroom door open where people can come and go (makeup, hair dryer, wash cloth) but it\u2019s another when each person has to be in the bathroom with the door closed individually. Everyone has to be fully dressed the whole time - no running around in towels or half dressed with your sisters - with a male in the room you can\u2019t have any of that. With 3 women???  I just don\u2019t see it.", "NTA and honestly it doesnt even matter if its the night before your wedding or not. If three sisters are staying in a room together and one person objects/is uncomfortable to a man/boyfriend being in the room, that's the end of it the boyfriend cannot stay in the same room.", "No way, this is ridiculous I can\u2019t believe your sister thinks this is ok? It\u2019s really bizarre I\u2019m bewildered. You will be NTA at all if you put a stop to this. It\u2019s your wedding night ffs.", "NTA it's your wedding. Stand your ground on the things that matter to you.", "NTA. Wow! It's bad enough having three girls sharing a room and bath before a wedding, then Mom says, \"I know! Let's add someone else to that volatile mix.\"\n\nMy husband and I won't even share a room with my daughter on vacation. He's never even stayed at her house and we've been married for 13 years. \n\nI booked a room 1/2 a block from DD's venue 9 months before, and asked if she wanted me to get a room for her and FSIL, as well. She said she'd think about it. \n\nNight before the wedding, Groom, Best Man and Groom's sister stayed at DD's house. I was at the hotel. \n\nIn the end, happy couple wound up 4 doors down from us on their wedding night. Unplanned. \n\nMom needs to suck it up and get another room for the bf because *she* invited him. WTF does that, anyway? \n\nBF is only 50 minutes away. MOB can pay for gas money, I guess. \n\nOr, she can apologize and say she was terribly wrong and not thinking. MOB screwed up and she needs to fix it.", "I do not see what is so absurd about that. I feel that sister is totally fine for askin, but OP is obviously NTA since if she is not comfortable sharing a bedroom with someone she has the right to say no.", "I agree with the NTA because everyone should be confortable, but I don't know if it is because I am not American but it is so absurd to me that you find it weird that a boyfriend would sleep in the same room as other women. Why would the parent not agree ?", "For real, it's borderline neglectful and really shows a lack of healthy boundries.", "For real, the idea that it makes the bride uncomfortable is one thing, but anyone acting like it's totally okay for a grown man, who is stranger to this family, to just come share.a room with the 15yr old sister is crazy! \n\nWhat kind of mother is like, yeah this 24 year old man I've never met rooming with my 15 year old daughter is totally chill. Ffs.", "They don\u2019t normally sleep together on a regular basis anyway: the sister lives with *her* parents and the boyfriend lives with *his* parents! So it\u2019s not like OP is asking the sister to deny herself something she does nightly.", "Your commute sounds awful, I'm sorry. No way I'd do that every day, but power to ya.\n\nBut I'd drive 4x that to be at a family function and not even think about it. Well, except to make sure I had healthy road snacks so I don't die of fast food poisoning.", "He\u2019s 24. He should be working. He can pay for a room if he wants to stay in the hotel. NTA", "I\u2019d tell her you\u2019re lucky he\u2019s even being allowed at the wedding. He can find his own room.", "Hell no OP, you are the only person who gets to invite people to your suite.  Most brides want that sisterly/female bonding time leading up to the wedding where you have some champagne and play some silly games, etc.  How awkward to have a random dude there at the same time.", "Absolutely NTA \n\nYour sister, on the other hand, is being SUPER inconsiderate!!!", "NTA\n\nIts the Bridal suite, consider it a girls night in, i.e. no boys allowed. \n\nAside from tradition going \"bridal suite, no men allowed\", thats how it was arranged and booked with the hotel, thats how you as guests signed up to share together. Even adding another woman to the mix should be a consultation between everyone who shares the room, but Bride especially gets a veto on anyone. \n\nMy only other advice is \"watch out\" coz crap like this is what sets up an engagement at your wedding. I.e. sister makes last minute changes to basic plans and heavy pushes how close her bf is with the family. \n\nThey are dating 6 years and the family doesn't know him and your wedding is her introduction of him, their opportunity....nah dude! \n\nYour wedding is not a staging ground for other peoples family stuff. Same as its not the time to announce pregnancies or other news, or being relatives people had a falling out with and try resolve their relationships... you're not a venue for their problems.", "Make sure he doesn't propose during your reception!", "Your wedding, your rules. He can drive 50i Utes or get a room of his own.", "Lmao my bf and I have been dating for less than a year, and neither of us live anywhere near our family. We've still made the time to meet each others family because that's important to us both. \n\nNTA, but your sister kinda is.", "Yeah there has to be some other reason he insists on staying with her. Can't believe your parents are ok with this.", "This 62 yr old Scottish crone is upset and furious that your mom is being so daft.   \n\n\nYou do NOT need to share a room with a man at any time and you certainly don't want one getting under your feet the night before your wedding.   \n\n\nAs others have suggested, if it's no big deal he can share with your mom and dad.", "But they\u2019re not upset that their 15yo daughter is sharing a bedroom with him? Does she get a say in this plan? \nNTA\nDude can sleep in the car.", "Your mom is okay with a 24 yo man sharing a room with their teenage daughter, their daughter who is getting married, and the gf? That\u2019s just gross all the way around. Ewwwww", "6 years is enough time to get to know you and your family. He's just cheap.", "It does suck sometimes lol\n\nBut right? I absolutely agree. I'd happily drive that for family or fun. It's not likely an hour is a massive inconvenience for a good time. Certainly less of a weird thing then spending three nights in the same room as 3 members of the opposite sex", "If it\u2019s your moms idea then tell her to let him sleep with her in their room, not yours!", "Was it though or is she protecting your sister?", "I think he is meeting the extended family, the ones flying in for the wedding.  He already knows the immediate family.  NTA, of course you don\u2019t want to spend the night before your wedding with him in the room. Fifty minutes is not a long drive.  He probably wants to drink, but if that is the case he needs to find someone else to bunk with.", "Sounds like the sister initiated it, not the boyfriend.", "It\u2019s not tho it\u2019s their parents suit and the girls are sharing a room in it.", "Tell your parents that forcing a man into the bedroom of the bride and a 15-year-old girl is incredibly inappropriate, and you will tell everybody at the wedding what she was up to if she doesn't stop immediately.

The rehearsal dinner attendees were indicative of \"family\".\n\nMy daughter tried to meet his Mother a couple of years, ago. No-go. They took a trip and knocked on her door. She wouldn't answer, or even meet my daughter, at lunch. She didn't come to the wedding. Pretty sure my daughter and I would have ponied up for her, if she'd wanted to attend. I made the offer. \n\nFamily dynamics can be strange.", "No, seriously. Drive it home for them.", "Take your 15yo sister with you.", "Yeah, I personally do not think it is weird to ask but it is also not weird for OP or the 15 year old to be uncomfortable.", "Or announces pregnancy or engagement, just something to take focus from the bridal party.\n\nOP, I would ask someone you're comfortable with to remind them that nope of that is acceptable, but in a non aggressive way, just in case.", "I haven't had enough coffee...I read that as a sibling cousin and wondered what kind of redneck weddings you had been to where the sibling is also a cousin.  LOL!", "Those guests will not be sleeping in the bridal suite", "I don\u2019t think staying the night is the issue. They\u2019ve been together 6 years.

If this wasnt the wedding night than I dont think having him stay there would be weird at all", "Lol. Yes direct your rage at my comment. Not the commute!", "You do understand that your wedding traditions aren\u2019t universal, right? \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "He thinks that\u2019s ok?!?

The fact that it's even an issue being entertained is insane. \n\nYikes", "NTA\n\nEek. OP, the additional comments on your mom are uncomfortable beyond just how she is treating you for this one incident. Hope you got the best night possible and have an amazing wedding.", "This is my thought too. OP needs to get her MOH or someone close to the family to have a friendly chat to see what's up. It might be nothing but OP's sister does not have any sense of what is or is not appropriate and I am also getting bad vibes about this.", "This. My bro is in a similar situation, we can not stand his drug addicted stripper GF with kids, he is a college educated success, or was. He tries to normalize her constantly, my whole family refuses and tries to introduce him to far better people.", "You would think so...but then these people think it appropriate to impinge on the bride's privacy the night before her wedding.", "Normally I would agree with you but this is weirdly intrusive for a couple wanting to sleep in one bedroom with two sisters (one only 15 years old) who don\u2019t want it. I totally expect them to go a step further and have sex in their presence.", "How on *earth* is his (and her) lack of planning your problem to solve?", "Surely there are other hotel rooms within a 50 minute drive of your wedding venue?

Like all of us. And like with every child, the more you resist the more they resist. The harder you try, the harder he will resist. Because he won't just have to accept that he was wrong about her, he will also have to accept that you were right. And his ego will try its best to stop your brother from admitting that not only was his assessment of her wrong, he will also have to swallow the fact that after so many attempts for him to reach to same conclusion you have, he was blind to it.
