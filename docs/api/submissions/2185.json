Are your parents aware that your 24 yo sister is planning on the boyfriend staying in the same room as the younger sister?

If the sister and boyfriend want him to make a good impression on the family, insisting on inappropriate sleeping arrangements is _NOT_ the way to go about about it. \n\nAlso, the way you handle this going forward will determine if you\u2019re the AH or not. Talk to your sister and tell her that it would mean the world to you if all three sisters could have a girls\u2019 night together before the wedding.

Where are you guys staying that it costs that much for a couple nights??\n\nCan the cost of the room be split between the 4 of you? Not that you should be responsible for housing your sister's boyfriend, but since cost is an issue, spending $250 each so that you can have some privacy with your sisters the night before your wedding night might be money well spent.", "Almost all nice hotels are at least $250 a night plus taxes and fees. It really adds up. But how hard would it be for your parents to pay really? It's a drop on the bucket I'd they're paying for the wedding and everyone else's room. Or like I posted elsewhere - he could share your fathers room and your mother could stay with her daughters."]}
