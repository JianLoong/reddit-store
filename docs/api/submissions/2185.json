Spending your wedding and the time around it with your future husband sounds like the reasonable thing to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne would suppose yo would actually want to spend as much of that time with him instead of going out of your way to avoid him and spend the nights with anybody but him.", "Yet they'll let him share a room with their other 2 daughters? One of which is a minor!", "Can you call him and explain it\u2019s causing a big argument? Like so he\u2019s on your side.\n\nWhy would this grown man want to sleep in a room with a 15 year old girl too that is really wrong.", "Then why are they OK with him sleeping in the same room as your 15 yo sister? This is insane.  And you've mentioned your mother, what about your father?", "I disagree when the guy lives just under an hour away.\n\nHe's not coming back from the war - they can do with one/a few nights apart in the lead up to a wedding.", "You should just do that if the reasonable request of not having a man stay in the bridal suite isn't met.\n\nIt's not worth letting your parents control you.", "NTA, she should get a room with her bf. Did she even run this by your parents?", "Do you understand the traditions of weddings?\n\nBrides do not spend the night before the wedding with the groom and his family. I'm not sure why you would think that is \"appropriate and normal\".", "That is better than sleeping in the same room with a 15 year old.", "Ugh gross ... Even more reason to steer clear. What a weirdo.\n\nMy guess, since it's clear in 6 years he hasn't \"met\" anybody in the family, sister is riding the coattails of this event to help legitimize her own relationship, drag him along, force him into \"closeness\" with her family. Who she's trying to convince is the question lol", "Is it also ok for sisters partner to spend his nights in the same bedroom as his partners 2 sisters, one of whom is only 15?", "Oh I get it now, you\u2019re the sister", "Bloody ken oath the sister can be ordered around!  The bride has to do jack shit all in this situation as it's HER event. Why should the bride, the reason they are all even there in the first place , be subject in any way to conditions laid down by others? In all fairness it's the sister who should be given her options, which are to either stay with the bride in the suite with their other sister WITHOUT the partner or foot the bill herself for a room for herself and her partner if she's insistent on having him stay with her during the nights. There's even a third option available to sister - following the daytime activities both she and her partner piss off to his parents' house 50 minutes away to spend the nights there.\n\nAnd FWIW the parents of these girls are just as much in the wrong by wielding the fact they paid for the room in favour of the sister's unreasonable request. Sister can dictate terms when it's HER turn to have a wedding.", "No! OP should not have to rent a second room for themselves!", "You and the 15 y o sister", ">Can you rent a different room just for you.\n\nTo leave her **15 year old sister** to deal with the boyfriend and the entitled sister? \n\nThat would be an AH thing for OP to do to her little sis.", "Why would he agree to that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP's sister is his partner, and THEY want to spend time together.", "You're not the boyfriend, are you?", ">Yet they'll let him share a room with their other 2 daughters? \n\nTo be pedantic, the OP's parents don't get a say in who shares a room with the OP, who's 26.\n\nAgreed they should put their foot down about the OP's youngest sister though.", "THEY probably can, for something that is more important to them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut this is their sister's wedding, and likely MOM wanted OPs sister there, so she offered that solution.", "They COULD. But they are fine not to agree to do that.\n\nThey are adults, and just guests at a wedding. And - obviously - most guests are not doing it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is just **the bride that wants to spend these days without her future husband**, That is completely fine, **but NOT ONE of the other guests does it, the parents don't do it, so why would just the bride's sister be singled out to do it? -** There is NO need for her to agree to that, she is fine not to.", "And where in the wedding traditions does the boyfriend of the sister sleep in the room of the bride?\n\nThey also said it was *more* appropriate and normal\u2026 it\u2019s 2022 and Im guessing more than a few couples don\u2019t follow the tradition of sleeping apart whilst nobody is having a bloody sleepover with their sisters boyfriend and a teenager.\n\nIf one scenario was more \u201cnormal and appropriate\u201d it\u2019s certainly sleeping with your soon to be husband than a teenager and another couple.", "OP also talks about her mom trying to pressure her into letting the BF stay in the room. The whole thing is bizarre.", "YES.", "It seems like OP didn't rent the first room, their parents did. OP should book her own hotel room.", "Well OP can\u2019t complain about the free room they will be staying in then.", "Well the sister can come with. It\u2019s not rocket science.", "That's my daily commute. If I can do it five times a week for 2 years, he'll survive a couple days.", "The whole thing makes no sense.  I don't understand how under any circumstances she would want to sleep with her boyfriend... while her two sisters were in the room with her.", "Gotta be either the boyfriend or the sister.", "Whilst I agree with you that they shouldn't get a say... OP seems to think that they do, probably because they are footing the bill", "He sees no problem with sleeping in the BRIDAL SUITE with his girlfriends two sisters, one of whom is 15!?!?!?!?!?!\n\nThe only man that can't see a problem with that is the man who's gonna be leering at you two all night.", "Singled out??? The other sister is a teenager - the parents are paying for the suite.", "Giving the situation, that's the one reasonable option you have left. Please go spend the night at your in-laws, they will be more than happy to have you.\n\nYour parents are extremely out of line.", "You're going to have to upset your parents, or between then and now, stump up the cash for the separate room in the hotel.", "Seriously, good luck with everything and congratulations on the upcoming wedding, this weirdness aside, getting married is the best thing I ever did. Enjoy the wedding, and take comfort knowing that this internet stranger, as well as many others are giving the boyfriend some serious side eye over this whole situation....I'm a guy, if I was invited to stay in my girlfriends, sisters bridal suite the night before the wedding I'd be like \"hell no!\" first of all weird, secondly no offense to any brides and pre wedding girl hangs, that situation kind of sounds like my nightmare.", "Earlier you'd mentioned an \"included bridal suite at the venue\", can you and your 15 year old sister just stay there?  Or your sister and BF stay there?", "This is so weird. Why does your sister want him there so much? Is she going to be hooking up with him while you and your 15-year-old sister are in the room with them?!\n\nBecause if they\u2019re not gonna do that then why can\u2019t they be apart for a night or two?", "So focus on your mom, and not on your sister - **It is likely that the only reason your sister agreed to stay there is the same as yours: Your parents will be extremely upset if she doesn't. And she seems to be willing to accept it in order not to cause drama with your parents at YOUR wedding - which is nice.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou will have to solve this with your mom, not your sister. And it likely will cause drama.", "I've been reading comments like they're on fire \ud83d\ude02\nSo fucking bizarre! She says they don't even like the guy?!?! W.T.F.", "No idea what type of family you come from but in the majority of cultures I have experienced this would not be deemed ok", "But she's getting married so it's a treat.  If her sister wants to bring someone else into the room she should be the one who pays for her own bed.", "They absolutely can when one of the residents of the room, who also HAS A FREE ROOM, invites someone of the opposite gender, that hasnt met any of the family yet, to stay in the **Bridal Suite** with a **Bride-To-Be** and a **15 YEAR OLD**, and then **serves an ultimatum** rather than **checking** with the residents of the room and the **FUCKING BRIDE** that it would be okay in the first fucking place...!", "SHe likely wants her sister there for \"everything\" - and since that guy is her partner and thus part of the family, he will likely attend \"everything\", too.", "Sister 100%", "Super out of line. \n\nBut if the choice is between the bride spending 100 minutes a day commuting to the wedding, vs bride\u2019s sister\u2019s guest spending 100 minutes a day commuting\u2026 I mean the bride is already going to be busy and stressed, and it\u2019s much more important for her to enjoy the day than some guy. \n\nBride\u2019s parents suck. This room was a gift to the bride but it sure isn\u2019t now.", "If one thing is very apparent from AITA subreddit and experiences I've seen friends go through. \"Treats\" coming from family members in regards to wedding planning are more often than not used as leverage for other people to get their hand in the mix.\n\nIt's why my wife and I didn't take a penny from family for our wedding, except my dad bought everyone lunch at small family get together (parents and siblings from both sides only) right before the wedding, but my dad is really chill.", "The parents are paying and are fine with it apparently. \n\nThe parents are paying for a family suite. \n\nAs I said the bride doesn\u2019t have to stay there but she isn\u2019t paying so she doesn\u2019t get to decide. Simple as that.", "i would try to have another convo with them now they you feel more empowered and validated in your stance, but if they insist, just show them this thread. be ready for it to backfire as they will likely claim your airing out family drama to the whole world.", "Not at all weird. Send this link! See what they say!", "I mean, just ask them at what point they've considered your point of view and what conclusions they came to on how they think you would feel about it. Ask them why, on your wedding night, her BFs comfort is more important than your own? Why do his feelings supersede your feelings?", "Could you book a room for yourself, just for the night before the wedding? Believe me, you will need a good night sleep, and appreciate having a room to yourself.", "Weddings are never financially wise.  You do what you have to do.  If your mom and sister are fucking nuts, go stay with your fiance the whole time and let your mom spend all weekend with the boyfriend in the next room.", "That's.... Not how that works, on her *wedding night*. It might work for other times, but not on her damn wedding. Since it's her wedding. Yeah, they did something nice and got a suite - that doesn't mean they get carte blache to put any rando in and make the person they got the room for suck it up. It wasn't conditional at the beginning, it shouldn't be conditional now, and this has major golden-child/scape-goat energy for her sister to pull this shit.", "She does get to decide. \n\nThe parents can, in turn, say that they are overruling her and installing this person in her suite, at which point she can decide to get her own room (or go stay at her fianc\u00e9\u2019s).", "So fucked up lol like, how is this going to be the better option ***family***????", "The bride will - together with the groom.", "Do read the part about the 15f year old that will be in thus room with this couple both 24 who will probably not behave or make sure to not make her uncomfortable. Guys tend to have less shame and not realize how bad certain behaviors actually are. Unless I knew this person super duper well I would never let a 24m sleep in a room with a 15 year old girl.\n\nEDIT: Also sister 24f seems to have no manners already (invited her without talking to bride about this)"]}
