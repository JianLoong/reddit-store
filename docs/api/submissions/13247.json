If you are able, I would move out.", "NTA\n\nIt is unfair of your mother to expect her teenaged daughter to cook two or three meals because she has health issues and her adult son is a picky eater. While it may seem like you are getting the short stick, both of you are getting hurt by her behavior.\n\nBy expecting you not only to cook for him, but make either what he likes or make an extra meal, she is prioritizing him over you. She is serving it with a side of guilt by suggesting your resistance may cause her life threatening health problems, which is emotionally damaging. She is providing you practice with life and coping skills, though. \n\nBy comparison, your brother is learning that he neither has to provide for his food at home nor eat what is being served. Since he is neither asked nor expected to cook, he is learning that he must be catered to in order to survive, so she is not really helping him, but she\u2019s probably not going to change.  \n\nYou could take back some control by deciding what nights you will cook, and planning what will be on the menu. You could invite your brother to help with the prep or the planning and tell him which days he may choose to go out to eat. \n\nIf he is disabled, offer to help him learn how to become more independent by cooking his favorite meals on his own. If he doesn\u2019t want you to teach him, suggest he check out YouTube. I hope it gets better.\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79", "NTA sounds like our baby boy might need to learn how to cook", "Bruh.

You were helping your mother by preparing food that she would otherwise have done. By not doing that you have allowed your mother to take that burden back on.
