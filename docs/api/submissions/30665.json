Lodging fell through and everyone is freaking out about the financial aspect. Sarah took the reins, while people are stressed, and sent a cat video out saying she'll miss them?\n\nPeople are stressed out and Sarah is spamming the group chat with her little furballs?\n\nI typed that \"sentence\" out twice and you got a fuck you. Sarah kinda sucks here in the nicest way possible.", "NTA- she knew that thread was for trip information, she knew you were waiting for information from her, no one cared about her cats at that moment.", "NTA. Some people need to be reminded that the world does not revolve around them. Your friend\u2019s trivial moment from her daily life has zero significance in the group chat. Unfortunately some people as adults still haven\u2019t learned that for the most part, other people don\u2019t give a shit about your life. \n\nI honestly would have been sharper with my words than you were if I had been in that situation \ud83d\ude2c", "i mean.....you could have left the part about her cats out of what you said and just asked for the hotel info.  although what you said might be true, it did escalate the conversation, especially since she was already on the defensive.  \n\nhowever, she did break the group chat agreement, and when she was reminded of that, she got all pissy.  she could have just apologized, shared the relevant info and everyone could have moved on with their lives.\n\nESH.", "NTA.

A gentle \"cute video- can you please put it in our general text instead?\" would have sufficed. YTA", "YTA chill out, I don\u2019t see what the big deal was. It\u2019s not like an immediate life or death situation lol", "Sarah sounds like a dramatic asshole that needs to go to some group therapy to understand how to speak without implying others guilt and project feelings. \n\nShe needs some emotional intelligence", "The cat pics strikes me as a power move. Sarah had information you all wanted and decided since she had your attention she would force you to indulge her.  She seems kind of needy and sad. Still not okay. You just said what everyone else was thinking and she is well aware. Hence the anger. Easier to deflect her embarrassment at her socially inept behavior using you as the scapegoat.  Or maybe I\u2019m completely wrong. Still vote NTA", "Ehh if Sarah is the one doing the work of reorganizing everything and rebooking I would think you all could put up with a couple of photos. It's not like an extra few minutes is going to make a difference, so if the car pictures are such a big damn deal then maybe one of y'all should've done it yourselves.", "YTA. What is the purpose of being so controlling about a group chat? Seems to not really be in the friendsgiving spirit. Is your whole trip rigidly structured, or just the discussions about it? It sounds more like a chore than a trip with friends.", "NTA, fuck those cats and fuck Sarah too.", "NTA She\u2019s an ass just for using that stupid language to describe cats. Love cats, but even they would claw the eyeballs of people talking like that if they weren\u2019t dependent on them for food.", "ESH. Y\u2019all could have been nicer to Sarah for going through all the trouble. Just ignoring her comment and asking for the info but Sarah also knew that the Chat was suppose to be about trip only and she has already apologized. Have you? \n\nKey to maintaining friendships when there are challenges like this is open communication and boundaries. If you think there is tension, talk reasonably with Sarah. Ask her where she\u2019s coming from and telling her where you are. Both take accountability for your part in it. Cause yeah ESH", "YTA. Why were you \"scrambling to put your trip back together,\" it sounds like she had already found and confirmed the hotel by the time you made your comment. Sounds like the trip was together. \n\nAnd why would you *want* to be a dick to someone you're about to go on a trip with? It's obviously going to dampen the mood of the trip.", "YTA. Sarah, find better friends, Jesus.", "YTA. Being stressed doesn't give anyone an excuse to be a jerk to their friend. It's not as if she made you wait days for the hotel info. And just because they're cats, it doesn't diminish the value her cats have in her life and if something adds value or brings happiness to your friend, you shouldn't make her feel bad for that. You guys are her friends and she wanted to share that with you, so what if it delayed the hotel info by a matter of minutes? I wouldn't want to be in that friend group if y'all are so stressed and uptight that you limit what you guys are allowed to talk about or share.", "I don't think your comment put a damper on the trip. Sarah managed that all by herself and her FU message was the icing on the cake. Is she always this way? I'm not sure why you all would include her if she is. NTA.", "it\u2019s really annoying when people talk about their cats, i mean i get you have pets but honestly no one cares and you shouldn\u2019t feel bad.  it\u2019s understandable about what you said, but if she seems upset with you still maybe you should apologise just to keep the peace", "NTA. Rules were set from the beginning and people were asking for pertinent information.
