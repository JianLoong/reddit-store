This is a trip I've been planning for a couple years and is somewhat of a splurge for me.\n\nI have 6 children (31M, 30M, 19F, 16M, 9F, 7M). My oldest son is paying for himself and his 2 sons (7M, 5M), and I'm paying the costs for everyone else including my 30 y/o's fianc\u00e9 and my 16 y/o sons\u2019 best friend.\n\nMy girlfriend is also coming with us and I'm paying for her and her 5 y/o daughter.\n\nMy 19 y/o daughter asked me if her boyfriend (of 15 months) could come with us on vacation. My answer was yes but that he would have to pay the extra costs (flights, excursions, etc). We're renting a house and my daughter would be getting her own room anyway so he could stay in there for no extra cost.\n\nAccording to her, the only reason her boyfriend isn't coming is because he can't \"afford\" it. This essentially translates to his parents have refused to pay for it. I know his parents are wealthy and in fact are currently on vacation. My daughter is not with them and from what I know was not invited.\n\nMy daughter has been begging me to just pay for him so he can come. My answer has remained no, and we have argued quite a lot about it.\n\nOne of her biggest objections is that I am paying for multiple other non-family members and that her older brother (30M) is old enough to be paying for himself. She has not agreed with my defences.\n\nWhen it comes to my 30 y/o and his fianc\u00e9, they would have chosen not to come if I was not covering the bigger expenses for them. They are paying for a wedding in May and don't have money for a trip like this right now. I love them both and wanted them to come which is why I'm happy to pay for them.\n\nMy 16 y/o has been best friends with the kid that's coming with us since 1st grade. He's been raised by a single mom, dad's not in the picture and money's always been tight for them. He's never been on a proper vacation, and he spends so much time at my house he is practically family.\n\nMy daughter's biggest issue is my paying for my girlfriend and her daughter, which she then escalated to be about any of the money I've spent of my gf. I told her it was none of her business how I spend money on my partner or how we split expenses. I earn 3x as much as my gf why would I expect her to split costs evenly.\n\nMy daughter is upset with me right now and I feel bad but don't really think I'm being an asshole. My gf thinks I was being an asshole during an argument with my daughter because I pointed out the people I'm paying for are the people I want to be there, obviously making her think I just don't want her bf there, even though I have a neutral stance on it. My gf thinks I should cut my losses and just pay for the bf. I think she's just saying this because she feels bad my daughter turned it into an issue about her.

Technically, it is your money and you can spend it as you like, but you seem to be throwing trip money at everyone else and digging in your heels about one person. A person important to your daughter who has been in her life for over a year. \n\nWhich is more important? This hill you have chosen to die on or your relationship with your daughter?", "ESH I think. It\u2019s entitled for anyone to demand that you pay for their companion to come, but I can see how you look like a hypocrite when you\u2019re helping grown adults pay for it and younger children. It definitely comes off like you just don\u2019t like the boyfriend, or in fact that you might favor your your daughter less than your other kids, which I suspect is something she might be responding to here.", "YTA because it\u2019s one thing paying for a fianc\u00e9, but it\u2019s a bit of a piss take you\u2019re paying for your kid\u2019s friend to come and still refuse to pay for your daughter\u2019s long term boyfriend when they have been together for over a year, it\u2019s not like they got together last week (then I\u2019d have said fair enough). It should be the same rules for everyone, not different for each of your children.", "I'm going with YTA but only slightly. Your reasoning is sound, in the sense that he has wealthy parents (though you don't know from the outside what their actual financial situation is, maybe they like to appear wealthier than they actually are?), and they don't want to pay for him to go. Also they didn't invite your daughter along with them on their vacation. However, he himself can't afford the trip, so you are purely basing this on his parents income. But also, if he didn't go then your daughter would be the only one on the trip without a +1, which also doesn't seem fair.\n\nYour daughter's argument about your gf is not fair since you are not going to plan a holiday of this sort without your own partner.\n\nPerhaps you could reach out to the bf's family and see if you could split the cost between you?", "Sorry bud, but YTA.  She's got a good point.  You're picking and choosing, and it seems you've chose to pay for everyone but her boyfriend. It's like the teachers always say \"did you bring enough for everyone?\"  \"His parents are rich\" so tf what?  Clearly you're rich too if you're paying for 11 people to go on vacation TO NICURAGUA!!!!  It's not like you're going to Myrtle Beach, my guy.", "INFO: if she asked to bring her bff would you say yes?", "Your big mistake was letting anyone know who you're paying for. You want to pay for your 30 y/o daughter's fiance? Keep it on the down low. But now that it's out seems like one more won't break you.", "YTA it\u2019s hardly fair that you\u2019re paying for your 16 year olds friend and not your 19 year olds boyfriend. You\u2019re also paying for your 30 year olds fianc\u00e9, does he not have a job? can\u2019t he pay for himself?", "NTA, that\u2019s super entitled thinking. I was 17 the first time my bf came on a family vacation and we paid for our portion separately as if we were on a separate trip. Your money your discretion. I like that your girlfriend still had  compassion for her even after she became the scapegoat. But you are NTA Don\u2019t fall for this now with your daughter or the wedding will be a hoot!", "NTA it's your money and your trip and you made a reasonable offer to her.", "YTA. You broke the rule about treating all kids fairly. What you do for one, you do for all. Otherwise, you are playing favorites. If you pay for one kid, you should pay for all kids. If you pay for one kid's +1, you should pay for all kids' +1. You can craft the rules however you like, but they should apply across the board. For example, you agree to pay for the kids' portion of family vacations until they reach the age of 30 or until they graduate or something along those lines.\n\nTo make it easier on your pocketbook, you could have offered to make each kid's +1 a birthday and/or Christmas present so you don't need to gift them anything more this year.\n\nOr, you could have just not offered to pay for any +1's, but it's too late for that now.", "It\u2019s definitely a double standard. You can spend your money how you like, but you\u2019re creating animosity by treating people differently.", "Nta it's your money and you're allowed to decide how to spend it", "NTA. Your daughter didn't even get an invitation to pay herself to join her bf and family in their trip and she wants you to pay for him to join your family?", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s shocking how anyone expects free vacations from you.\nYou can pay for family members but why for bf?", "NTA. Once again, not surprised by the entitlement of some of these commenters thinking you need to pay for boyfriend to go.", "NTA.  It is your money to spend as you wish.  If your daughter doesn\u2019t like the arrangements, she is ild enough ti stay home, get a job, then pay for her own vacations as she wishes.", "It's your money and you can pay for whoever you want.  NTA", "YTA. You have zero good reason not to invite him and you are **not** neutral. The truth slipped out and you don\u2019t want him there. \n\nIf you don\u2019t pay for the bf, you\u2019ll pay via your relationship with your daughter - and don\u2019t you dare ask her to baby sit the kids. Not even once. \n\nStop lying. You suck.", "Think about it\u2026everyone will have a partner there, the small children have each other\u2026and your daughter will be the only single person surrounded by couples and kids, or be pushed as a babysitter. Is this really a hill to die on when you\u2019re already paying for so many others? Can you offer something?\n\nYTA", "YTA.  so let me get this straight, you\u2019ll pay for your son\u2019s best friend but not for your daughters, long-term boyfriend? And then you say that it\u2019s about who can afford to come and who can\u2019t, yet your only reason for paying for a 30-year-old fianc\u00e9 is that they can\u2019t afford it because of wedding costs? You\u2019re clearly valuing the other children over this daughter and she knows it. Prepare for her to go either low contact or no contact with you.", "NTA - I can see why it doesn't seem fair to your daughter and if I were her, I'd probably be upset with it.\n\nHowever, that being said it's your money, so you get to choose how you spend it. No one else is entitled to a vacation on your dime.", "YTA. You\u2019re bringing other people\u2019s kids and you can clearly afford it. Plus it would make your daughter happy.", "NTA. 19 is an adult. They've only been dating a year and this vacation has been in the works for longer than that. Everyone else you're paying for is essentially established as a family member. It sucks his parents are stingy, but after the fit your daughter threw, I definitely wouldn't be paying. It's not okay for your daughter to attack your relationship with your girlfriend just because she's not getting her way.", "YTA - and there it is \"I pointed out the people I'm paying for are the people I want to be there, obviously making her think I just don't want her bf there, even though I have a neutral stance on it.\"  You don't want the boyfriend to go on vacation with you.   Clearly he is only paying for his daughter as he wants a built-in babysitter for the little kids.\n\nSo judgmental about his parents can afford it.  You can afford it too, you just don't like your daughter very much and you are happy for everyone else to know that.", "YTA.  You definitely seem to be trying to purposely exclude one person.", "I'm gonna say ESH.\n\nNo one is entitled to get a free vacation on your dime. But the 19 year old is basically the only one on the trip without a plus-one, so I can see why she thinks she'll be miserable and wants her bf there. If this is well within your means to afford, it could be worth doing just to make your daughter's trip experience as fun as your other kids'.", "NTA - your money, your trip, your reasoning for who you have included an invited. Your daughter doesn\u2019t get to dictate how you spend money.", "NTA! I don't care if you're paying for the whole street to go on the trip, it's your money and you're business. You're more than generous to say he can go, especially since he's on vacation with his parent's right now and they didn't invite her, then that would be another reason I wouldn't pay. If she wants him to go so badly, tell her to pay...she's an adult! I wonder did HE make a fuss like this to HIS parent's about taking HER on vacation.", "I'm going against the grain with an NTA here for several reasons. \n\nThe most basic reasoning is that it's your money to choose how you want to spend. It sounds like her boyfriend has had enough time to get a job and budget going if he wanted to bad enough. Doesn't sound like he really wants to go that badly. You also make the good point that they went on vacation and didn't offer at all for your daughter to go. \n\nThere is a big difference between paying for your son's friend who sounds like he's really close to all of you and almost part of the family, plus you've already budgeted for him to be there. \n\nYour daughter and her boyfriend are at an age where maybe they last, but there's a much higher chance that they will not. This is a major difference from paying for your other older kids Fianc\u00e9.  \n\nUltimately, you said he's welcome to come on the trip, you're just not going to fund it. I think that's an extremely reasonable response. I understand why your daughter is hurt by it being that she's the only one going without someone, but she's also acting pretty entitled by throwing a toddler tantrum about it.", "ESH. \n\nIf the rules were consistent I\u2019d say otherwise, but given you\u2019re inviting the 16 year old\u2019s friend and the 19 year old has been dating her boyfriend for over a year now it really does just come across as you playing favourites. His parents finances  are frankly irrelevant, and absolutely none of your business. Either you\u2019re offering to pay for +1s to come or you\u2019re not. \n\nUnless there\u2019s other examples of you funding things for your girlfriend/her daughter at the expense of your own children, your daughter\u2019s comments make her an asshole too. They likely stem from her trying to find a reason why you wouldn\u2019t pay for her boyfriend given your insistence that you\u2019re completely neutral towards him, but they\u2019re still uncalled for.", "NTA, and your daughter should be more concerned they didn't invite her on their current vacation & will not pay for their son going on vacation with her.", "YTA. You\u2019re paying for all these people and can separe one more? This sounds like a trip from hell with all those young kids. If I were the 19yo I wouldn\u2019t go.", "NTA, \n\nYour money so you can pay for whoever you want.", "NTA, I think the OP is paying for people who could use the extra money. The BF in this case comes from money. I would say, OP's money Op's choice. The daughter can stay home if she likes. Bf's family did not invite the daughter so this reciprocated. The BFs family did not consider your daughter close enough to invite along on their vacation. I don't care if op can afford this or not but it's his decision. The bf's family or he doesn't have/want to pay... well then... honestly, they have money and you did the minimum, which was inviting him along at his cost.", "NTA, your reasoning seems fair to me. To a teenager, this is of course the end of the world.", "YTA--you are paying for one childs friend,  and another childs fiance...there is no logical reason to not pay for your daughters long term boyfriend.", "NTA", "NTA", "Y T A\n\nYou\u2019re only basing it on the fact that he has wealthy parents. He said he doesn\u2019t have the money and you said \u201cwell tough luck\u201d yet your child\u2019s friend who also doesn\u2019t have the money gets to go and your son and his fiance gets to go even though they don\u2019t have the money either . So no one has the money to go and you don\u2019t have an issue with them but you have an issue with the one that has the wealthy parents? \n\n\nYou\u2019re playing favorites and clearly the boyfriend is not one of them.", "NTA, you daughter thinks that she is entitled to her wishes.  She need to realize that.", "NTA!   Your money, your rules.  Your trip.  Be strong.   This could totally get outta hand if you let it.  If you buy a child a souvenir or anyone for that matter, are you going to have to buy them a souvenir too??", "NTA", "If your daughter wants her boyfriend to come so bad, why doesn't she get a job and pay his way?\n\nEdited to add judgment NTA", "NTA.... Sorry but she's being completely greedy, needy and ungrateful....  Maybe she should stay home with her BF if she thinks daddy is so cheap", "Oh the hypocrisy of Reddit. It is HIS money, he can pay for whoever he wants. NTA.", "Yes it is your money and can do as you wish. With you paying for the friend then I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for your justification for not the bf. \n\nSome rich parents pay less than the single parent son that you are paying for. \n\nAs for your gf, yes you can pay for her but in your daughter\u2019s mind why can\u2019t your gf pay for herself and daughter? Your logic would be the same as you asking  for the bf to pay. If your gf can\u2019t afford it then she shouldn\u2019t go.\n\nDon\u2019t be a teaching your daughter a lesson that you can\u2019t stand by in your own relationship", "ESH.\nHer for trying to force you to do something you don\u2019t want to.\nYou for making it clear her boyfriend is less priority than the people you like and are willing to pay for. That\u2019s done if true, but don\u2019t expect your teen daughter to welcome that sentiment with open arms. You said everything you needed to say about how you view her boyfriend. \n\nI don\u2019t disagree with you not taking him, but at least be honest and just say \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d", "YTA, you have selective reasoning and are giving some kids perks that all aren't getting.", "Kind of think YTA since you're paying for your other kid's non-relative guests, yeah. Paying for a fiance, okay, but paying for a bestie and not her boyfriend? Ehhhh I can see why she's pissed. She's acting a little entitled but she's also the only sibling who doesn't get a plus one paid for by you.", "No, YTA...it cracks me up that you're paying for the 30 year old's Fianc\u00e9 otherwise they won't go...so if the 19 year old threatened to not come would you end up paying?", "NTA what people are failing to see is it is your money and you can spend it on whoever and however you choose to spend it. I understand your daughter wants it to be equal across-the-board but it\u2019s not her bank account that it\u2019s coming out of. You don\u2019t owe her any explanations. if she does not want to come without her boyfriend, then she does not have to go either. It sounds like his family has the means to have taken her on vacation and shows Not to as well. What you do with your finances or no one\u2019s business but your own", "Nta-your money, your decisions.", "YTA.  If you paid only for you and her, cool but you paid for everyone SAVE him, making him singled out for the entire vacation.  Was your plan to then go to restaurant and smile as he's drinking water because he has no budget for this sort of stuff?  This is so disconnected with reality it'd be funny if it wasn't so stupidly cruel.", "NTA, besides what 19 year old would want his girlfriends parents paying for him?", "YTA \n\nI've softened it a bit because I would have voted the other way if you weren't paying for the 16 year old's friend to come.\n\nYour daughter is going to see that as favoritism, ime any kid would in that circumstance.", "YTA you\u2019re welcome to do whatever you want with your money but you still have to deal with the consequences of your choices. Based on the information you provided, it seems like you\u2019ve got double standards for your oldest daughter and the oldest sons. Is it because they\u2019re not engaged? Then don\u2019t pay for the 16 year old\u2019s friend. Is it because they\u2019re not minors and can pay for themselves? Then don\u2019t pay for the 30 year old\u2019s fianc\u00e9.

Shelling out an extra $1000 which it seems like you can afford just fine? Or ruining your relationship with your daughter? \n\nYou said it yourself that the people you are paying for are people you want to be there, clearly signaling to your daughter that you don't care about her happiness. Maybe you don't particularly like the kid, that's fine, some people just don't click.

Sure, you're not obligated to pay for 19 y/o's bf and yes, it's your money to do with what you want. But you're being very picky and choosey about who you're paying for and this will make a lasting impact regardless of your purported reasoning. Your 19 y/o and her bf have been together a good amount of time and his parents being rich is completely irrelevant to the convo, so it definitely looks like you think he doesn't deserve to come along...that's obviously going to lead to bad blood.\n\nBottom line is you're entitled to choose who to pay for but there will be consequences to your choices.

My answer was yes but that he would have to pay the extra costs (flights, excursions, etc). We're renting a house and my daughter would be getting her own room anyway so he could stay in there for no extra cost.\n\nAccording to her, the only reason her boyfriend isn't coming is because he can't \"afford\" it.

I love them both and wanted them to come which is why I'm happy to pay for them.\r  \nMy 16 y/o has been best friends with the kid that's coming with us since 1st grade. He's been raised by a single mom, dad's not in the picture and money's always been tight for them. He's never been on a proper vacation, and he spends so much time at my house he is practically family.\n\nMy daughter's biggest issue is my paying for my girlfriend and her daughter, which she then escalated to be about any of the money I've spent of my gf. I told her it was none of her business how I spend money on my partner or how we split expenses. I earn 3x as much as my gf why would I expect her to split costs evenly. \n\n\rMy daughter is upset with me right now and I feel bad but don't really think I'm being an asshole. My gf thinks I was being an asshole during an argument with my daughter because I pointed out the people I'm paying for are the people I want to be there, obviously making her think I just don't want her bf there, even though I have a neutral stance on it. My gf I should cut my losses and just pay for the bf. I think she's just saying this because she feels bad my daughter turned it into an issue about her.

The former is likely a much stronger relationship at that age. At this point, I would let the BFF come if she is willing to pay her way. The dad is being a jerk.

I understand that the daughter is upset, but realistically that relationship isn't very long and who really knows how long they may last at that age. He probably wasn't factored in when the trip was being planned out, and why would he honestly? I can see if they were high school sweethearts or something that the dad would be more likely to pay.

So the flight, location, food, excursions which impact him more than you, you pick. They are also likely more expensive now than when you got them. The fact is you are comping a lot of adults and younger people, including non blood relatives you think of as family. You just told this guy he is not family. Have you considered he might be family to your daughter? Have you considered that by doing this, you are creating an unforgivable rift not only with him but also with your daughter. Sure, not at this moment, but it will grow and be highlighted in future actions. The impact will hit you hard, and then you will be back here asking what you did that was so wrong. Taked as a wronged former son inlaw. These things, attitudes, and actions add up fast. Before you know it, they could be engaged, married and you estranged. They might break up, and all your daughter will remember is how cheap you were, how you disrespected the most important person in  her life. Either everyone pays or everyone is covered, who is not a relative. I know this is a wrong response, but trust me, you are going to reap damages you cannot fix, and it would not surprise me if she decided not to go.", "NTA your money do what you like.  Your daughter is entitled it's a short terms relationship & she can pay for it.  Who you spend money on is none of her business.  If she wants to buy her relationship then she can, he has money.   Not your problem at all.", "Nta, bring who you want and pay for who you want. Get petty with it and don't take your daughter.", "I mean with the amount you\u2019re already paying, it really seems like money isn\u2019t an issue at all. So while you\u2019re not obligated to pay, I can see why your daughter is upset, as it just seems kinda petty to pay for everyone but him. So imma say YTA.", "You\u2019ve been planning this for years. The daughter\u2019s BF was not there years ago. Everyone else was. How the AH?", "NTA, the boyfriend is old enough to pay for his own vacation.", "Yes you are.\nYour daughter is right", "NTA.  Also, I find it deeply bizarre that people pay to bring their children's boyfriends/girlfriends along on family trips.  Probably the boyfriend's family feels the same way, which is why they didn't bring OP's daughter on their trip.  \n\nHowever, looking at the age spread and the fact that the 16 year old boy is bringing a friend, it well could be that 19 year old daughter is looking at the 9 year old, the 7 year old, and the 5 year old and is subconsciously worried that as the sole unattached participant she's going to wind up on babysitting duty the whole trip. It wouldn't surprise me if she decides to stay home.", "NTA. Your daughter is being entitled to ypur money", "NTA, ignore the other people about it, they just dont understand what is money.", "If I was the 19 year old daughter I don\u2019t think I\u2019d go, because all they want out of her is someone who can babysit all the young kids. No thanks.", "NTA but you need to put your daughter in check about staying out of your relationship with your gf.", "yeah, you're an asshole for clearly favouring everyone else's plus 1s but your daughter's long term bf but it is your money, she might end up hating you for it for a while and if you're okay with that, do your thing.", "Info: you can clearly very easily afford it since you're already paying for like a dozen people so why are you paying for him? Honest answer.", "YTA\n\nYou failed to provide an explanation as to why her boyfriend shouldn't be there.\n\nEnough said.", "I love that saying \u201cyou can be right or be kind\u201d\n\nFeels like reddit loves justice boners where it\u2019s so black and white, but kindness and real life gets lost on this sub", "Someone asked if the daughter could have her BFF come, and OP said no. The daughter is going to end up being a babysitter.", "The daughter couldn't bring her BFF if she asked and will probably end up being the babysitter.", "It's honestly a difficult one, but I feel sure there must be a compromise to be found here somewhere. For a 19 y/o a 15 month relationship would probably feel like everything, and she would consider him family. But from an adult perspective 15 months and a young relationship they see it from the perspective of it being \"young love\" and not destined to last, and not part of family. Why should dad pay for his daughter's bf who comes from a wealthy family? On the other hand why should everyone else get their partner/friend and not her? It's so easy to see both sides of this argument.\n\nOne thing op doesn't seem to mention is how long he's been with his gf. Or did I miss that? Cus if it's less than 15 months I could definitely see why the daughter would be mad.", "Where the OP really seems to have fucked up is arguing the merits of each +1, instead of just creating a neutral rule about +1s and sticking to it.", "Well OP has also said in another comment that she asked if her best friend could come (who could pay for her self) and he said no to that as well. Seems like OP just doesn't want her to bring anyone at all. She's 100% gonna be stuck with the kids on babysitting duty while the rest of the family have fun.", "He's definitely TA, but it seems like he is not paying for her boyfriend or her best friend so he can force her to babysit.", "I don't understand how all of these comments are missing the point by so much. \nPaying for the bf to come along isn't about the bf, it's about the daughter having a good time. If she has no one, she's going to be stuck as the 5th wheel or watching out for the littles. Honestly, I wouldn't even go if I were her. Imagine being on this vacation essentially by yourself while everyone in your family has a good time with their partner or bestie. \nOP is making this sound like it's about money, which I don't believe, but even if it were... The cost isn't for the bf to have a good time it's for your daughter to not be miserable and alone. YTA", "I wouldn't go either. Let's just assume that this isn't the free babysitting scenario that a lot of people have pointed out and I think is definitely possible. She's the only non-child that's functionally \"alone.\" That could easily turn into a bummer situation for her. Being lonely in a crowd sucks. Maybe that wouldn't be the case but that's how I'd feel.", ">They likely stem from her trying to find a reason why you wouldn\u2019t pay for her boyfriend given your insistence that you\u2019re completely neutral towards him, but they\u2019re still uncalled for.\n\nI wonder if OP tried to dismiss her request as \"I'm not paying for him because I don't consider him family as he hasn't been around for long enough\" and his daughter is raising his relationship with the girlfriend because it's fairly recent as well.\n\nThe fact that the girlfriend is on his daughter's side is pretty telling, IMO.", "whilst this is true, he'd sabotaging his relationship with his daughter over this.\n\nEveryone else is having a great time where OP paid for a great family holiday.\n\nShe instead is a spare wheel, probably lumbered with the kids, and just learnt how she comes second to 30+yo fiance's and 16yo friends in her father's eyes.\n\nIf you think \"its my money I can spend it how I like\" makes him not an asshole then fine, but whilst correct, I cant possible see how you can think that.", "Well, OP said in another comment he wouldn't even allow her to bring a childhood friend. So, I guess he ain't that fair at all.", "This angle didn't occur to me before the comments but honestly, yeah it really tracks. Who knows, could be way off base but this is so common it's hard not to consider.", "But the eldest son is paying for him and his two kids on his own?", "That\u2019s assuming he isnt a full time college student though, like yeah he could work part time but not on short notice and without being swamped with work.", "Lol, you had a much different 20th year than me. I was spending 40 hours a week on studying and 15 hours a week working as a part time  tutor to pay for the tuition that provincial loans wouldn\u2019t cover. I made it through but the only age group with less financial means than 16 year olds are 20 year olds who have to pay for food and rent as well.", "Well OP has also said in another comment that she asked if her best friend could come (who could pay for her self) and he said no to that as well. Seems like OP just doesn't want her to bring anyone at all. She's 100% gonna be stuck with the kids on babysitting duty while the rest of the family have fun.", "this is it, too far down to get logical.", "Which is why they said they aren't going to go rather than demanding OP to pay for them.", "THIS. She should just not go. He'll freak out even more then because I agree. He thinks he has a free sitter for the kids.", "Well OP has also said in another comment that she asked if her best friend could come (who could pay for her self) and he said no to that as well. Seems like OP just doesn't want her to bring anyone at all.

It's so common for young women to get stuck in this role, it's definitely not to be counted out as a possibility. \n\nIt's just so common and it's not like OP is going to say it. When I was a younger single woman (or someone who just didn't have their partner there right then) childcare and household duties were commonly put off on me, even if there were men of similar age that were just as capable and alone (not that I think it's fair to have the random single folks doing extra work on vacation just because no one is there for them anyway, but still).", "The 19yo also asked if her best friend could come instead, who could pay for their own flights/accommodation  but he said no to that as well. It's pretty obvious from that that he wants her to be alone so she can get lumbered with the babysitting duties.", "I'm even older, and ironically, I'd have a much harder time doing it now than I would've at 16.", "lol seriously. these people are like:\n\"N TA, it's his burger and he's allowed to throw it in the bin in front of a homeless person if he wants to\".\n\nit's scary how many people think morals and rights are the same thing", "Well OP has also said in another comment that she asked if her best friend could come (who could pay for her self) and he said no to that as well.

Plenty of parents do that. And now they can afford to pay with there own money. I don't see how this is even remotely an issue. They are getting married....they are family. Maybe the trip is their wedding present etc.", "So she goes alone and is the only person on the holiday that doesn't have a partner? sounds fun.

And it pisses me off.", "That\u2019s how I feel about the not allowing husbands in the delivery room ones. Like yeah technically it\u2019s a personal medical procedure but raising a child is a team affair starting from conception.", "2 16 yo boys. I bet she will be saddled with crap like that. Comes with being the eldest daughter in a patriarchal society.", "I agree. Especially seeing his comment where he said no to her own BFF. So it seems to be anyone she wants to bring because I'm guessing she's known her best friend longer than her boyfriend, he says she's been on trips with them before.", "Fianc\u00e9s can just as easy become ex\u2019s as a boyfriend can.", "Yeah this definitely make OP YTA. I was fully on their side until that came out. Cleary just wanting her as a babysitter. Why can't her best friend come and pay for themselves (when the son gets that)", "Someone asked if the daughter could bring her BFF and OP said no.", "For all you know, they're doing a $500 courthouse wedding in smart casual.\n\nOP giving excuses like \"they're paying for a wedding\" and \"this kid's family can't afford it\" but then goes on to say that his daughter's BFF can't even come if she pays her own way.\n\nSo is it about money, or isn't it?", "OP has said in another comment that she asked if her best friend could come (who could pay for her self) and he said no to that as well.

It his money and yes he can spend it any way he wants. But he is still an AH and for some money he could have a very good relationship with his daughter. Or just tell her the truth and he considers her childcare staff.", "We can agree to disagree then. I think it\u2019s mean to have his daughter be the only one alone on the trip while he pays for everyone else to not be alone.", "Same here, I was working FT, renting my own place and paying all my own bills at 16, married with a kid by 20. But I'm pretty sure I'm safe when I say we aren't the norm, much less the majority.", "Ding, ding, ding.", "This is how I read it also.", "I believe that too. OP says he thought his daughter wasn\u2019t invited. Why would the bf\u2019s parents invite her if their son wasn\u2019t with them on their vacation? It seems like the bf is with his parents.", "Maybe the brother met his fiance a month ago, the story doesn't say, so you can decide that the fiance relationship is more \"important\" but you can't say it's \"probably\" longer, that's an invention to justify siding with OP.", "But op isn\u2019t including her bff or bf hence she is going to be the free babysitter.", "Yup. That was added afterwards and new information so I added an edit to my orginial comment waaaaay up above, lol. (And I agree with you)", "Sure! Unlike loads of Reddit, I have no problem agreeing to disagree. :)", "He is a \u201cfamily friend\u201d to ONE child. That\u2019s favorites. It\u2019s asshole behavior.", "It\u2019s giving strong built in babysitter vibes. Also just sounds like a crap trip - everyone has friends but her. She\u2019s 19, I\u2019m surprised just not going hasn\u2019t come up more.", "Vacationing with your family changes those odds. My parents have included my brother's best friend from high school on our trips for a long time, since my husband and I started dating in college and they wanted to balance things out. \n\nWe're in our mid 40s, and not only are they still friends, but the four of us are close. We're a gaming crew and take trips just the four of us. He's like a brother to me, too."]}
