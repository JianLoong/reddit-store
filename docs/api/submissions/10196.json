Must have been a pretty bad date if they were so distracted by another table's conversation.", "Omg, SO NTA. Fuck that guy and his total lack of empathy. Maybe he should be a better conversationalist so he and his date could have focused on their conversation instead of yours!", "Absolutely NTA\n\nLook, you're fighting cancer, pay no mind to the random tossers around you, and kudos to your friend to stand up for you.", "NTA \n\nHe didn't have to listen to your conversation, unless you were standing on your chair and shouting to the whole resturant? No? OK, you're good!", "NTA.  You were with friends who cared about you and wanted to hear it.  If some moron at another table wants to eavesdrop on a conversation that has nothing to do with him, and then tell them that what they were talking about was inappropriate, he can piss up a rope.      It's very easy to figure out who the A is here, and it's not you.", "NTA, Jfc, that guy is doubly the AH, one for eavesdropping, two for having the temerity to say to you that you ruined the mood by talking about your cancer. I hope his date lost his number", "NTA. I hope this dipshit's date realised what she was getting into. I'm sorry he made you uncomfortable, but hopefully you saved someone from a life with him. Good luck with your treatment.", "NTA, it's very obvious that guy is just a morally bankrupt asshole. \n\nSorry you had to experience this during such a sensitive time. You don't owe it to anyone to hide your hardship and pain. Let alone a stranger in public.", "NTA. When you go out to eat in public, you may hear other people talking. It's part of going out. It's not your problem he was uncomfortable.", "No, NTA.  The guy making the remark needs to butt out of things that don't concern him.  He's a major AH.\n\nYour response should've been, \"I'm sorry my cancer is inconvenient for your lunch plans.\"", "NTA - that other diner was a massive asshole.", "NTA, what's the dude's problem??", "Absolutely NTA\n\nYour friends wanted an update and be able to support you, that stranger had no right to interject\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your diagnosis, but hope you continue to fight and stay strong! \n\nAnd seriously, never listen to idiots who feel the need to offer unsolicited comments into a conversation that does not concern them.", "Absolutely NTA. This guy was eavesdropping on your conversation and then has the nerve to complain about what you\u2019re talking about? Good on your friend for telling him to mind his own business. You did absolutely nothing wrong here.", "NTA. The guy was so bored on his date he decided to eavesdrop. I wish you a full recovery. You\u2019re allowed your discuss your life and health anywhere.", "NTA\n\nFirst, I\u2019m sorry about your diagnosis, I hope you will be ok.\n\nHe was rude to interrupt your dinner with his comment. He is in public, people are going to talk about different things.\nI didn\u2019t know we were only able to discuss happy things when out.\n\nWhat ruined his date was his comment, if I was on a date with him, I\u2019d be hesitant to another one.", "NTA at all.  If he'd been having any kind of interesting conversation on his own table then he wouldn't have heard you.  Plus he gets 100 extra AH points from me for confronting you about it.", "NTA", "NTA and if the topic of conversation had changed to rude blowhards whose dates should sneak out the back door of the restaurant and then lose the guy's number, I wouldn't have blamed you one bit.", "NTA.\n\n1. you were asked a question and all you did was answer\n2. you literally can't help that you have cancer, and you deserve to talk to your friends for support.\n3. that guy who complained was eavesdropping on a conversation that had nothing to do with him\n4. you didn't ruin their date, but he definitely did by being a jerk. I hope his date chooses not see him again after he showed his true colors. He was incredibly rude and insensitive.", "NTA. When you're in a public place you have to expect overhearing other peoples conversations, whatever they are. I'd understand if someone was being explicit of using way too many swaer words near a child, for example, but you were just talking to your friends and updating them on your life. He was the insensitive asshole in the situation.", "NTA. People need to mind their own business. I don't understand why some people feel the need to inject themselves into other peoples conversations.", "NTA - you were essentially out celebrating with your support group, and talking about your lives.  It is very normal that you'd end up talking about your cancer.

Guy was an evesdropper. \n\n(Overall, I would agree to not talk about unpleasant, icky topics in a loud voice in public settings or yo use foul language similarly. That doesn\u2019t sound remotely like what this is. So, I\u2019m not saying people should never be mindful about what they are discussing in a public setting. But you should *definitely* be allowed to discuss your cancer with friends in public.)", "NTA", "NTA - People are AHs. This guy was no exception.  Sorry he was such and ass to you and hope your treatment goes well.", "NTA and if I'd been his date I would have left him there!", "NTA , the guy was a jerk on evesdropping your conversation instead of minding his own business", "NTA. Talking about cancer is always uncomfortable and I am sorry you are having to go through it. \n\nSo your friend asked about an update and I think it was very appropriate of you to provide a response instead of remain silent about it. \n\nAs far as the couple on the date eavesdropping on you, TWBTA. Just rude, inconsiderate, and unrealistic expectations dining out. You didn't choose to have cancer. Wish they would have been at least a little bit empathetic or show some grace.", "This doesn't even really belong here. Dude is obviously the AH, sorry about your cancer.", "NTA, this dude can go heck himself\nHope you'll be okay though", "WTF. I got followed to my car after having a PRIVATE phone conversation someone didn\u2019t like. MYOB to these people. I am sorry and hope you get better.", "NTA.", "NTA. Also, why do some restaurants place tables so close to each other, no privacy smh.\n\nI get it, it's to save space, but still, I wish more restaurants, especially mid to high ends, were thoughtful about having good spacing between tables so that people could talk without having their conversations be heard by other people.", "NTA at allllll. You were having dinner with your friends, who clearly care about you and are concerned for you. They asked for life updates and you told them the news of the big C. \n\nThat couple should go f off. Sorry life isn\u2019t always roses and dandelions you entitled AH. This isn\u2019t your conversation so stay TF out of it. I think the awkwardness wasn\u2019t from your news but the d bag who snooped on your convo.\n\nGood luck OP, I wish you a speedy recovery, and hope you have many years to make beautiful memories with your friends and loved ones.
