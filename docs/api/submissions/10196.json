If he didn't like a completely acceptable conversation that he wasn't part of, then he should have minded his own business and continued his conversation with his date. He ruined his own night. You held your composure well. I would have snapped on him, \"oh, you don't like my depressing conversation, NEITHER DO I!!

It\u2019s jerks like him that make people terrified to talk about it, even though literally 50% of the population will have to go through this at some stage. My bestie recently had a mastectomy (she\u2019s in her 30s) \u2026 she also works in oncology with me and I guarantee if anyone piped up about us making them miserable when we were talking about her cancer she would have whipped that shirt right over her head and given him something to be uncomfortable about.
