While plenty of men are shitty, \"just fyi, your husband is going to leave you and you'll never have sex again\" is not a useful thing to say to newly diagnosed cancer patients\n\nCancer survivors who want to have sex continue to have sex. Spouses of cancer survivors can and do manage to maintain or rebuild attraction to even very changed bodies. If you are a cancer survivor who wants sex and your spouse can't or won't get into it with you, I don't think I just lucked in to a dozen or so men who can cope - I think lots of people can cope.", "NTA.\n\nIf I overhear someone is battling cancer, I'm either going to wish them luck or say nothing.  Life is hard enough without being an asshole to someone you know is fighting an uphill battle.", "NTA He should be focused on his date, not you.", "NTA and I would\u2019ve poured my water on his head.", "Baby, what I wanna say to that guy would get me banned from this sub. You\u2019re doing great. NTA", "NTA.  Dude shouldn\u2019t have been eavesdropping.", "NTA. This guy is a colossal bastard, and you did nothing wrong.  I'm so sorry this happened to you.", "NTA m", "NTA unless you're going into graphic detail about toe nails falling off and thrush infections.   Maybe it triggered something in him, like a memory of a loved one dying of cancer, but he's the massive asshole here, not you", "NTA you have every right to talk about whatever you choose at your table  lmao \n\nIt's a public place people talked about way worse. he probably was pressed and he ruined his date himself trying to talk about y'all like people need to learn how to mind their own business\n\ni'm sorry about your cancer.", "NTA, but that guy was definitely TA.", "NTA!!!  \nNo. Nope.  \nHis ears have this incredible function to them, that involves not focussing on conversations he isn't part of.  \n\nAs I say to my kids: make better choices, bruh.", "NTA.  His lack of empathy hopefully will cost him a follow up date.  Who would want to continue dating such an AH?", "What a heartless prick. NTA in anyway OP.", "Dude ruined his date by showing her what a douchevag he is. You did the girl a favour!", "NTA, if I was at your restaurant and overheard someone say that to another I would call them out for being rude and disrespectful. You were completely in the right, and best of luck man, I\u2019m sorry for your recent diagnosis.", "NTA. Your friend is awesome. You did nothing wrong. Hope the date sees what an asshat that guy is and runs. Sending positive vibes for your cancer journey. \ud83d\udc96", "NTA\n\nShould have told him to shove his plate of food up his arse.", "NTA! its not your fault that his date was having a shitty time", "NTA. why was the guy listening in on your private convo?", "I am so sorry you went through this! Totally NTA! I\u2019m only 38 and just went through a cancer recurrence (colon) and I\u2019m involved in some advocacy groups that are trying to end the stigma of talking openly about cancer (and especially early onset as we almost never get taken seriously because of our age). I\u2019m proud of you for being able to openly talk about it, and it sounds like that guy wasn\u2019t getting laid in the first place lol. Glad your friends are supportive \ud83d\ude0a", "I think his date noticed him staring at some girls so he felt compelled to make excuses.. regardless couldn't agree more..\n\nOP NTA", "Putting aside the depressing mood.. \n\nDepends on the volume of OP's conversation.\nThere are a lot of people in this world that have no idea how to control the volume of their conversation. I've definitely been on dates with my girlfriend that have been \"ruined\" by people loudly talking about whatever it is they have talked about. I usually just focus on my food and myself at that point. Whatever it is that they are talking about, it doesn't need to be said for the whole restaurant to hear. Almost all of the time its random conversation that isn't bad, but I still dont care. Basically, your voice shouldn't sound significantly louder than the persons voice sitting across from me talking at a normal level at most places.\n\nIf it was a respectable volume, it's definitely NTA.", "Hey at least now she knows he has absolutely no empathy and was apparently raised by wolves.", "She found out a lot about her date in that conversation, none of it good.", "My best first date was next to a very dramatic older couple (affairs on both ends, at least one 'secret child', references to 'the incident', etc. still partially convinced it was a hidden camera show that failed to take off), part way through I realized he was eavesdropping just as much as I was and the moment the other couple left we both absolutely lost it and had a blast dissecting their drama and speculating for the rest of the night", "It's part of going out. It's not your problem he was uncomfortable.", "I was warned. I've got surgery 1 next week. Thank you. I just grabbed the Target generic. Good to know the best ingredient.", "Right!", "I hope you're doing well now, and I'm glad your husband is a good one!", "Didn\u2019t Newt Gingrich do it also?", "Total bullshit. Lots of marriages don\u2019t survive cancer. But lots of marriages don\u2019t survive having kids or job loss or the many other stresses life throws at us. \n\nMy parents for example, stayed together thru breast cancer and continued to have a good sex life. At the time I wished I didn\u2019t know that detail. Looking back in the years since my mom died, I\u2019m just happy for them."]}
