And it sounds like you have anaemia, so get that checked out pronto, and take an Iron supplement, please. I crashed the car into a lamppost driving too soon after childbirth.", "NTA - Clearly there\u2019s something going on with your mom, but right now your focus is on yourself, your baby and your growing family. While you settle in to a new routine and life with a newborn, that is your focus. If she wants to see your child, then it\u2019s her responsibility to get herself to your home at a time that is mutually convenient. Placing that burden on a new mother is disrespectful. If she needs help with her new social anxiety or mental health issues, then she needs to reach out, but not place that responsibility on you as a new mother.", "NTA. Tell her your daughter is not less than her cousins and so are you", "Nta. It is simple, tell he if she is to sick leave the house then surely she is too sick to be around the baby and you look forward to the day she is well enough to come over", "NTA", "NTA, your energy needs to be focused on you and baby at the moment. You can\u2019t be running around after other people. You are probably exhausted still adjusting to a newborn and also taking baby out isn\u2019t advisable with so many virus etc as baby doesn\u2019t have an established immune system yet. It sucks as it does sound like she has something going on (anxiety or something else). Does your mother still drive? Does she have access to a phone that does FaceTime?", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on with your mom, and it sucks if she\u2019s actually dealing with social anxiety, but you are the exhausted mother of a newborn, and it\u2019s perfectly okay to say you don\u2019t feel up to making a trip over there. You have feeding and nap schedules to deal with, sleeplessness, hormone crashes, and everything else that goes along with having a newborn. \n\nIf you\u2019d made it clear she\u2019s welcome to come and visit, yet she still chooses not to, that\u2019s on her.", "NTA, your mom is a real piece of work.

Resist her pressure and be sure to let everyone know what she is doing.", "NTA. If your mother is to sick to leave the house she could invect your child (you can use this as an argument point). You are a new backed mother, You don't have to leave the house. Take care of yourself and your daughter and if your mother wants to meet her, she can come and visit. She might should look into meeting a therapist as well. But don't let yourself be guilttripted to do what she wants", "NTA.\n\nBut I think your mother needs help. \n\nMy grandma became like that when she got older. \"NO I can't come to you for Christmas \" \"NO I am too tired to come celebrate that birthday\". She just sat in front of her tv all day. It was really sad to see.\n\nMy mom and her siblings talked among them and decided whose turn it was to take grandma, then they shower up at her doorstep saying \"Hello mom, today we are going to my place for Christmas! I'll take you there and I 'll take you home again when you get tired. Now let's find a nice outfit for you!\" \n\nGrandma just went along with that person, and seemed to have a good time, almost as her old self, when she was at the thing. It was just the promising yes several days in advance, and the getting ready, that was too much for her.", "NTA. There is a thing of making yourself more ill because you refuse to try to lead a normal life.\n\nYou have a new baby why do you have to go to her? Normally people come to you. Exhausted, tired, struggling and having difficulty adapting to being a mom are reasonable reasons to not make the effort for someone who won't.\n\nIf you mom is refusing to make the effort but made the effort with your brothers. When was this? Has her condition changed since then?\n\nHate to say it but there is still an outdared stereotype that women have to drop everything and do unpaid caring roles because it is expected of them. If she puts effort in for other siblings but not you that is not fair.\n\nI'd tell her you are upset that it was a battle to get her to come to the baby shower. You were upset she didn't come to the hospital and you are struggling and upset you are being guilted and shamed. Tell her if she wants to see the baby. She has to put the effort in first.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Unfortunately, that's a vicious cycle.  You don't feel well enough to go to a doctor, so you don't go, and you just spiral down.  \n\n\nIt's extremely common for people at that age to hit a weird depression and massive energy drain.  I struggled a lot myself at that time.   Luckily a few courses of anti-depressants flipped the switch for me and I was able to rally.  Also, I didn't have anyone else but myself to bring home the paycheck, so I was sort of forced into at least some activity, so that helped.     If she never did this before and is just now experiencing it, as crappy as it feels to be on the receiving end of it, she may be legitimately in need of medical help.  Depression is no joke.    \n\n\nSo this may be a matter of you pressuring her to see a doctor.  Particularly as, from what you said in your OP, she wasn't like this before.  I know it feels personal, but if she's legit depressed and/or has a chronic fatigue type illness, it's not at all because she's trying to avoid you.", "If she wants to see the baby she should come to you. You should not have to travel with a newborn/2 month old baby, and she is only 5 min away", "NAH. It\u2019s not difficult for either of you to drive 5 minutes. You and your mom both feel unable to be up and about. Fine. But then the relationship dies on the vine if neither of you relents. \n\nIf your mom has social anxiety, don\u2019t make this a test of how much she cares for you or the baby. It\u2019s not about \u201cgiving in\u201d, it\u2019s about what relationship you want for your baby and mom. \n\nIf you\u2019re exhausted at 2 months, it\u2019s worth making sure your partner is pulling their weight and that you are getting checked for PPD, etc. \n\nHaving babies is very tiring, but there are resources that can help. Hang in there!", "NTA\n\nIf your Mother wants to see and be a part of your child's life, she can make the trip over to your place. You might want to put her calls on mute and let yourself move on with your life.", "No, it is not your responsibility to facilitate the relationship between your child and anyone. If they're interested, they can make the effort. If not, they can deal with the consequences of their inaction. It's so much easier for an adult (grandparent, aunt/uncle, ect) to come to you than it is for you to load up a baby, diaper bag, and whatever else to go to them. If it was so important to her, she'd make the effort. It doesn't take kids long to see who puts in the real effort to be a part of their lives and who doesn't. It's her choice to be in your child's life and it's not your responsibility to make it happen or even easy. Tell her she can show up or not, it's her choice.  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI bet she leaves when she needs to for other thinhs. \n\n>For instance the day of my baby shower she called saying she didn\u2019t feel good and probably wasn\u2019t gonna make it.

She needs to stop putting pressure on you.", "NTA, she can come to you. Obviously when someone has a baby it\u2019s a million times easier to visit them!", "NAH but your mum needs to speak to a doctor as it sounds like she does have a mental block over leaving the house and the longer this is left, the worse is likely to get. If she now has agoraphobia then she isn\u2019t going to leave without help. Which has probably been made worse by losing her job due to health reasons. The 5min distance means nothing if she is so anxious to leave. Trying to get you to go over there gives her an excuse to not confront her fears but not missing out on things she should be involved in. \n\nMy mum got the same way after COVID. She rarely left the house because she was so anxious. \n\nHonestly I wish you both the best and hope your mum gets the help she needs.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nIt's a 5 minute drive. Which means it's max 1hr walk, or 5 minutes by taxi/Uber. She can come see you. It's not your \"duty\" to drive to your mom because she thinks you ought to, especially with a new-born. It takes 30 minutes just to prepare the newborn for the 5 minute drive. Your mom is ridiculous.\n\nIf your mom is sick, then she shouldn't visit and you shouldn't take your newborn anywhere with sick people. At all.", "I can\u2019t say for sure but it\u2019s just my opinion since she won\u2019t see a therapist. But to be sick at every family event or any event at all isn\u2019t a coincidence.  She doesn\u2019t even go to the store anymore, my brother and sister in law does. (They live with her).", "I\u2019ve tried talking to her about it because this isn\u2019t normal. I told her she needs to see a therapist because her being sick all the time is all psychological but she refuses.", "I\u2019ve told her ( how am I supposed to bring her over when you\u2019re always \u201csick\u201d) her response is (I\u2019m not always sick).", "It\u2019s just a hard situation. I guess I\u2019m jealous of the mother my brothers got compared to what I got. It hurts that the same effort wasn\u2019t made. I know it\u2019s not completely her fault but her refusing any help is. As for my husband he helps when he can. He\u2019s a truck driver and I really only see him on his days off but my mil has been a live saver!", "I\u2019ve tried getting her to see a therapist but she refuses", "She has a perfectly running vehicle so she can\u2019t use that as an excuse. I don\u2019t believe she ever \u201csick\u201d it\u2019s just her excuse to get out of leaving the house.", "If you find a good moment to talk to her, tell her in a caring fashion you\u2019re concerned about her unwillingness to leave the house, and you want her to be able to enjoy life again. If you feel she would be open to it, there are Telehealth services where you can do therapy online. They\u2019re perfect for people who can\u2019t or won\u2019t leave the house. You can schedule her appointments for when your brother and SIL are out of the house, if she\u2019s concerned about privacy.", "As long as she refuses to accept that she has a problem you can't do much. With a newborn, there would only be that much you could do anyway.\n\nJust do not feel pressured or even guilty that you do not play into her mental problems in this situation. It would not make it better for anyone, if you did", "If she\u2019s refusing to help herself, you need to make if clear that, that does not mean you will bend to her will", "well it's not all pyschological as some people have weakened immune systems, but even that can have a serious impact on mental health\n\nbut even if it is all mental health related that would still make her v unwell no?", "What are the health problems that made her leave her job? Could they be tied to her behavior in any way?\n\nYou're not wrong by the way, but you're not going to get the result you want if you tell her it's all psychological. Being told the equivalent of \"it's all in your head\" likely puts her on the defense, because people commonly dismiss health issues that way. \n\nHer problems may originate in her mind, but it can cause very real physical symptoms. I thought I had my anxiety somewhat managed with treatment, but I was woefully wrong. It caused paradoxical vocal cord syndrome, and now my vocal cords will close and block my airway. Plenty of doctors brushed me off by telling me there's nothing wrong and it's all in my head (it is, but I still needed medical help). Discovering I have MS was also ridiculously circuitous. \n\nTry talking to her about her symptoms, rather than the source. Tell her you love her and you're really concerned. Tell her how much you miss her and that you want her to be healthy, as she has a lot of years being a grandmother ahead of her. Ask her to tell you what she feels, and how it's specifically affecting her. She might need some time to set aside any defensive reaction if that's how she's felt for a while. Help her feel validated by asking her to see her primary care physician and not a psychologist. Let her doctor handle that part, as she'll hopefully be more receptive to their medical advice.\n\nI know you're deeply hurt by your mom's actions, or lack thereof. It's hard, but try to remember she isn't specifically refusing to put effort towards you while she otherwise functions outside her home normally. Her inability to join the world outside should tell you this isn't personal, even though I know it feels that way. \n\nI know the pain in your heart makes you want to dig in your heels and wait until she \"values\" you enough to come see you, but I promise that's not the game she's playing. Something isn't okay inside of her. A lot of people's mental health declined due to the pandemic. Being able to hug her and look in her eyes while you tell her how much you miss her might help her break through some of the mental walls keeping her trapped.\n\nThis took me over an hour to write due to my health. I don't say that for sympathy, but to emphasize how much I want this to get better for you, your mom, and your little one. I wish you all the best \ud83d\udc9c", "Your wording needs to be specifically \u201cwhen you are well enough to get yourself here, you are welcome to come visit.\u201d That makes it clear that she should be visiting you. You\u2019re a Mom now; put your baby and yourself first.", "I would get her doctor involved, get them to do a home visit if need be. But you may have to accept that this is now her new norm.", "Not leaving her house is mentally sick...", "We'll just tell her \"sorry you're not feeling well mum, make sure you're feeling better before you come see bubba. I'm feeling sore and tired so be sure to let me know when you'll be here\"\n\nJust keep blanking here. \n\nYou have a newborn, this is the time people come to you, not you dragging a baby out and about everywhere."]}
