The two of them worked at the same company and would spend time together daily, they ended up developing feelings for each other and were sneaking around for almost two years, he left me and she left her husband. He also left me and my kids with nothing. My ex husband and I have two kids together (22M) and (20F) that are both off at school now, ex husband and I are NC, and my kids want nothing to do with him and Alex.\n\nI opened up my own bakery 3 years ago and the business has been great, as well as the money. We are very popular in my city and do a lot of custom orders for events like baby showers, gender reveals, birthday and most importantly weddings. \n\nA few days ago I'm at work and we get an order for a wedding cake. Two layer cake, red velvet cake, vanilla butter cream frosting and a sign that says \"congratulations \\*ex's name & Alex\\*\". I check the email address to be completely sure and sure enough, it's Alex's email address.\n\nThe absolute AUDACITY. I've tried to be the bigger person throughout my entire divorce with my ex, but this was taking it too far. There's hundreds of other bakeries in the area and they choose mine?\n\nSo I respond back to the order cancelling it giving some bs excuse like \"we're very busy right now with orders, the order is unfortunately cancelled\". \n\nWhat does she do? Couple hours later the order is resubmitted under a different email address. She must think I'm stupid.\n\nSo I decline the order again.\n\nI then get a call at my bakery from Alex telling my to stop cancelling her orders, that \"business is business\" and that I need to get over myself and stop being petty.\n\nI refused and hung up on her.\n\nI was then bombarded with calls on my person cell and to the bakery from Alex, my ex, my ex MIL etc. They were all fuming and demanded that I put the issues aside and treat them as \"regular customers\". Alex was sending me nasty text messages saying how I've \"taken this too far\" and that \"she expected me to be the bigger person and make the cake, since she's always been a fan of my cakes and they're the best in the city\". (Which is true, they are the best and very popular).\n\nI told them to all kick rocks and that both my ex husband and Alex have some audacity trying to order a cake from my business out of all places after all the shit they put me through. \n\nMy kids are both on my side, my mom think's I should've been the bigger person and made the cake.
