{"id": 30873, "submission_id": "17tzuy5", "title": "AITA for excluding my SIL from my baby shower?", "selftext": "I (mid-30s F) am pregnant, and a few months ago, my SIL (late-20s F) decided she wanted to throw a surprise baby shower. She asked my husband (mid-30s M) for our availability. He asked me what our schedule looked like for several weekends in the future because he wanted to have a get together with friends. At the time, I was overwhelmed with work and exhaustion at the time and said I'd check and get back to him. We both forgot about it.\n\nMy SIL reached out to my sister (30F), asking for help with the party. My sister called me, asked when I was free, and made up a story about coming to visit us for a weekend. I told her if she wanted to visit, it would be best to come on \\[convenient date\\]. My sister put invites together with \\[convenient date\\] and sent them out.\n\nMy SIL saw the invite, reached out to DH, and asked if we could choose a different date than \\[convenient date\\]. My husband said that \\[convenient date\\] couldn't be right because I had told him that my sister was visiting that weekend. One Abbott and Costello skit later, DH spilled the beans to me about the surprise party and asked me to pick a new date. I called my sister and told her I really didn't want a party (remember: exhaustion). If anything, it could just be an informal get together with both sides of our immediate family. She said that was all she and SIL had planned and invites had already gone out. I said fine.\n\nDH then explained to me the problem that SIL couldn't make \\[convenient date\\]. \\[Convenient date\\] was the only one that worked in the timeframe they gave, but I didn't want it cause drama, so I told him to tell them (our sisters) to cancel the party if it was going to be a problem. I'd take the day to sleep and that would be a lovely gift.\n\nLong story short: they didn't cancel the party; I made it through the party up until late afternoon/early evening, thanked everyone for their gifts, and went up to bed; my SIL didn't come, didn't send a gift\\*, and now she's being distant with me.\n\nTechnically, I'm not supposed to know that SIL's the one responsible for the idea of the party or that she feels snubbed that it happened on a date when she had to work. However, even if I actually didn't know, I'd notice the difference in how she behaves now: only interacts with me in the family chat and basically doesn't respond/react to anything I send her privately. And, of course, I did know that she couldn't come.\n\nStill, the whole thing seems ridiculous to me. I was asked for my availability. I gave it. I was thrown a party I didn't want. I did my best to be gracious. I feel like my SIL should either talk to me directly about her feelings or just move on. I don't think I deserve this cold shoulder treatment.\n\nAITA?\n\n\\*I want to be clear that I don't care about her not getting a gift. I just think it's weird that she was so gung-ho about throwing the party and *then* didn't send a gift.", "created_utc": 1699840128, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17tzuy5/aita_for_excluding_my_sil_from_my_baby_shower/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m barely functioning and a party sounds TERRIBLE.\n\nMy baby shower was like 10 people, we ate brunch, hung out for an hour, did a few gifts and then went home to nap. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to be gracious for an event you weren\u2019t involved in and literally said to cancel multiple times. Yes, SIL has her panties in a twist as she kept pushing for it and your sister is the one who made it happen, despite SIL\u2019s availability.\n\nI would just give her space for awhile and focus on resting.", "OK. Obviously, I needed more than whatever the word/character limit is because there seem to be some misunderstandings.\n\n1. I know everything ***now***. I did ***not*** at the time. It was supposed to be a ***surprise*** party. To be extremely clear, up until about two weeks before the party, I literally thought my sister was coming to visit and that was it.\n2. When my husband told me it was a party and asked me for a new date, he did not tell me it was because my SIL couldn't come. I thought it was because of another event (his best friend's birthday), which fell around the same weekend. I told him not to worry about it because I would just call my sister and cancel the whole thing now that I knew. My sister said \"they\" (she & SIL) had already sent out invitations. I decided to try to suck it up. Truly, not enough people seem to understand how wildly exhausting life is while pregnant.\n3. Clearly, I didn't properly explain what happened when I found out my SIL couldn't come. I was distressed. At the point that I found out, all of our weekends were booked for the timeframe I was given. Moving it closer to my due date was a hard no from me because I was already exhausted and feeling like hot garbage. So, I said to cancel. This was the second time I had asked for that. I didn't want to have a party. I certainly didn't want to have a party that was going to cause hurt feelings. Then, I was told that it would go on as planned because someone was flying in to be there. I was also told my SIL didn't want me to know anything about it or her role in it.\n4. I am ***not*** complaining that someone cared enough to throw me a party. My SIL is a great person; I love and appreciate her. I do not like big parties centered around me. It's not a crime to feel that way. I ***am*** complaining that no one listened to me when I said I really wasn't up for it. I ***am*** frustrated that the party happened when I ***TWICE*** said I didn't want it. I ***am*** baffled that I seem to be the only one getting the cold shoulder when I was ***specifically*** kept in the dark about things until it was too late and told that my SIL didn't want me to know about anything.", "NTA. I think if anyone is an asshole, it\u2019s your sister and husband. \n\n\nIf we give everyone in the scenario the benefit of the doubt, once your sister heard from SIL about the party, she\u2019s felt guilty or territorial about the fact that she should\u2019ve thought to throw you a party, and has leaped into overdrive in planning to make up for it. In doing so, she has stomped on SIL\u2019s plans and not taken her into consideration. I would suggest speaking to your sister about this & telling her to apologise to SIL just to clear the air for future. \n\n\nDH is a minor asshole as he knew about SIL plans and still didn\u2019t give her a date/follow up with you, but could\u2019ve just been absentmindedness. He probably could\u2019ve been more proactive at coordinating between sister & SIL to work out a plan once he became aware of the problem, without making it your problem. \n\n\nSIL feels slighted due to you not giving her a date, but giving your sister one. She also then feels extra upset that she couldn\u2019t make this date for a party that she tried to plan. She may or may not know how much you knew about this- maybe she thinks your sister looped you in on the plan and you deliberately went with your sisters party not hers - so I think she has every right to be upset. \n\n\nYou are NTA but I think YWBTA if you don\u2019t speak to your SIL. You don\u2019t have to take blame, but just say - \u2018hey, I\u2019ve found out about the mix up with the party planning! I really appreciate that you tried to throw me a party. I\u2019m sorry that it slipped my mind to give you a date and that silly DH didn\u2019t follow this up for you. \nI\u2019m also sorry my sister went ahead with a date without consulting you and you couldn\u2019t be there for the party - I missed your presence a lot. Hopefully we can catch up soon before baby arrives. He/she can\u2019t wait to meet you!\u2019\n\n\nSomething simple like that will clear the mix up and allow for the upset to clear instead of festering below the surface for you all. \n\n\nBest of luck for the baby and sorry you\u2019re dealing with this! Pregnancy is exhausting and maintaining social relationships was a really big drain for me too, so I understand how you\u2019re feeling.", "ESH\n\n\u201cMy sister put invites together with [convenient date] and sent them out.\u201d\n\nYour sister\u2019s the main AH for not going back to your SIL at this point before sending invites out. Your SIL reached out for help, and your sister took over, making decisions that excluded your SIL from the event altogether.\n\nYou get some AH points for not calling your sister in once you knew what had happened, and for not apologising to your SIL for how it all played out.", "Just initiate a convo with SIL, and give her some appreciation for being her, and missed her presence at the shower thing. A super normal, typical conversation with someone who you are close to, that was unable to attend an event & wanted there.  IF you didn't do that, then that is totally a shitty way to handly a relationship.\n\nSince SIL isn't talking & you aren't asking....you have no clue if its you, your sister, or she just needs to work through her feelings on her own time.  It might have nothing to do with you/your actions at all. I don't fucking know. I can only guess, like you are doing. When people don't use their big people words to communicate, all it is, is assumptions.\n\nAs for a verdict, NAH.  Reasoning being that you had zero control over something you had no say it whatsoever.  You didn't knowingly exclude anyone. No apology necessary.  SIL is also not an ass, because it is okay to be disappointed & hurt that she got totally push to the side for something SHE wanted to do for you. It doesn't sound like she is causing drama, she is just being quieter than normal for reasons you dont really know.  I could swing ESH due to the communication thing, and thinking you know sil's motivations and feelings when you haven't even asked and her for not communicating.", "So your sister wanted to take all the credit and didn\u2019t give a thing about the original planner AKA your poor sister in law. Your sister is the biggest asshole but you don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re frustrated with her. \n\nYour SIL tried to do something with love and excitement for you and you\u2019re here complaining how cold afterwards and complaining about you didn\u2019t get a gift and you\u2019re hurt that she didn\u2019t come (at your comments). Are you for real??? \n\nShe wanted to be there and asked for the date to change and you didn\u2019t change it so she couldn\u2019t come! You have no right to be hurt over this. Also, you\u2019re not entitled to a gift at an event that SHE COULDNT COME ESPECIALLY AT AN EVENT SHE ORIGINALLY PLANNED AND YOUR SISTER TOOK OVER FROM HER. And you let her. His sister asked you for a date but you didn\u2019t care and she had to ask to your sister so don\u2019t come here and say she should have asked me like in your comments; she DID ask you and didn\u2019t get an answer.\n\nYour attitude and the way you blame your sister in law is the asshole part of yours. She learned her lesson though. That\u2019s why she\u2019s distant and rightfully so. It sounds like your loss though, not her. She sounds like a lovely lady, unlike you and your sister.\n\nYTA", "SIL wanted to surprise you, asked for availability through DH, both you and hubby forgot about it.\n\nSIL still goes another route-asks your sister for help planning a surprise. \n\nYour sister acquires gets the convenient date and then plans the party herself (NOT SIL.)\n\nYour sister is now the head of this party (NOT SIL), and planned it in such a way that slighted your SIL.\n\nInstead of saying \u201cplease cancel it\u201d and owning it, you say \u201cplease cancel IF\u2026.\u201d And that left the choice to your sister. \n\nYou show up anyway. SIL wasnt there. That\u2019s not your fault-but not seems like your sister stole the thunder, and being \u2018gracious\u2019 is how you treat people and understand intentions and selflessness, not just by showing up to a party you didn\u2019t want. \n\nHow you\u2019re indifferent to all of that makes YTA.", "Nta, you didn't exclude her, circumstances did. I also kinda blame your sister for not communicating with sil before sending invites. But so it goes. \nAlso wanted to say, who throws a pregnant woman a surprise party? Always sounds like a bad idea to me!", "I understand your point, but if you can't see why SIL justifiably feels slighted and that you are involved in why, then YTA OP.", "I was really torn on how to judge this until I got to your footnote at the end.  You can\u2019t imagine why your SIL felt hurt and slighted that she was trying to plan a shower for you, but then your sister totally co-opted it and when you found out, your reaction was to shrug and basically say who cares about SIL?  You could not have made your real feelings about her any clearer.  Any now you\u2019re butthurt about not getting a gift from her?\n\nYTA.", "How does she treat your sister?", "A year ago you were asking if \"it was wrong not to be friends with your sister-in-law\" and how you didn't like her. So why are you complaining about her not talking to you now?", "YTA-for your utter indifference.  But the real AH is your sister and her actions fucked your relationship with your SIL.  Your DH is also an asshole because his sister was trying to do something nice and he forgot about it.", "NTA\n\nYou did not exclude her.\nYou were asked for a date, and you gave one, albeit just to hang out with your sister.\n\nYour husband sucks though, \nFirst, he forgets to get back to his sister about the whole thing, which is what led to all the drama in the first place.\nThen he totally spoils the surprise part of it and throws everyone else under the bus but himself when he tells you that sil wanted to organize it, but can't make it on this day.\nNow it puts you in the position you are in, where you can not talk to sil as you were never meant to know about her part in all of it until the fact.\nTBH canceling the party would have been sucky as other people had already made arrangements to be there for you, SIL should have tried harder to be there on the day. Does she have any kids of her own? Sounds like she does understand how much pregnancy can drain a person and leave you feeling like a wrung out rag. If she did she would have understood that your availability was based on how tired you are at the moment and either made it to the party on the day you gave, or still planned it the way she wanted even if she could not be there.", "Wow you tried to be gracious for a party you didn\u2019t even want or ask for. How super thoughtful of you. Your SIL should be thankful that you are sooooo gracious and attended a party she planned to surprise you to share in your major life event and you graciously attended it anyway knowing that she couldn\u2019t come.

I'd ask your SiL why she's being distant with you - and if she says it's about the party, tell her that you had absolutely no control over that at all, and it's unfair of her to take her upset out on you when it happened over your direct protests. All you did was try to be gracious about the whole thing - you were only supposed to have a weekend visit from your sister.", "NTA\n\nand if I would have chosen to become a mother I would have been very glad that I am German. Our baby showers are visiting the mother in hospital, congratulating her, giving her a gift, looking at the baby, telling how cute it is, clapping our knees once and leaving, lol. When I read the American spectacles about babies and actually weddings I feel exhausted only by reading it (not judging it, everyone on their own, if you love baby showers, gender reveals and/or a big wedding with bridesmaids and all, good for you (just, please, don't burn down half your state or something), it just would not fit my very German character).", "NTA.

A reasonable person would anyway realise you're exhausted and really don't need this additional stress right now, which is possibly why she didn't want you to know about her involvement in the aftermath.

If anything, it could just be an informal get together with both sides of our immediate family.\n\nGot shot down\n\n>She said that was all she and SIL had planned and invites had already gone out. I said fine.\n\nOPs second attempt\n\n>so I told him to tell them (our sisters) to cancel the party if it was going to be a problem. \n\nGot ignored or forgotten about. \n\nPlus all the cloak and dagger crap getting OP to pick a date, not once did anyone ever listen to OP saying \"I'm exhausted and I don't want a party.\" How is OP TA when her wishes went ignored.\n\nOP is pregnant, tired, probably feels like crap and definitely NTA.", "1) it was a surprise party, so I didn\u2019t know what I was being asked for.  \n2) It was not explained to me that it was my SIL\u2019s idea until it was also explained to me that she couldn\u2019t come on the date I had given.  I did call my sister and ask what the hell was going on. I said, again, cancel the thing.  \n3) You can decide that I\u2019m being dishonest about not wanting a party. I can\u2019t stop you, but if that\u2019s what you\u2019re basing your verdict on, then I don\u2019t accept it because I do not like to have big parties that center on me. I like them even less when I feel like absolute hot sewage water and have had months of terrible sleep. Pregnancy is challenging.  \n4) I quite honestly don\u2019t know what the protocol is to apologize for a surprise party that I didn\u2019t want being put on by someone who wasn\u2019t the original planner when literally no one listened to me about not wanting the damn thing. I thought I was planning to hang out with my sister, then it turned into a nightmare.", "I think the thing that is maybe not clear from my post is that I didn't have all this information in the moment. This is what I have discovered after the fact. I was under the impression that my sister was visiting up until maybe two weeks before the actual party happened.\n\nI was not in charge of the thing. When I found out what it actually was, I was distressed because I was in no way in a position to entertain or be the center of attention. I asked twice for the thing to please not happen.\n\n***I called my sister and told her I really didn't want a party (remember: exhaustion).***\n\n***\\[Convenient date\\] was the only one that worked in the timeframe they gave, but I didn't want it cause drama, so I told him to tell them (our sisters) to cancel the party if it was going to be a problem.***\n\nIf I had had access to the guest list and invites, I would have said - hey folks, there was a misunderstanding and unfortunately, this party is not happening.\n\nSo, if your verdict is that I'm the AH because my actions showed that I didn't care about her then I guess I should have called her directly and said thanks, but please don't do this.", "Yeah, that makes sense. I think I might be the AH for not just diving into the convo however hard/stressful I'm anticipating it being.", "Of course she is thinking about herself.   OP is the pregnant one.   OP is the tired one.  SIL was given a date.  SIL couldn't make the party that OP had said she didn't really want.", "Wow, you really would rather die on this hill than apologize to your SIL.", "Yes and no. I would apologize but I don\u2019t honestly know what else I could have done in the moment, and I feel like I\u2019m being punished for bad communication that I had no control over.", "You knew your SIL wasn\u2019t available on the date you chose, and you knew your SIL was co-hosting the shower with your sister.  You had all the information you needed to make a different choice, but instead you choose to exclude your SIL.  You really think that hasn\u2019t gotten back to her?", "Apologize now and stop trying to fight the verdict. This is the wrong hill to die on.", "I object to the way you're putting it because it's a warping of what happened. I ***didn't*** know either of those things until it was too late. My sister asked when she could come up to visit. That's what I knew. That's the date I gave.\n\nWhen I discovered what the date was really for and that my SIL couldn't come, I told my sister and husband to cancel the whole thing. Then, ***I*** was told: nope, someone's flying in, so this is what's happening. At literally no point was I like, good, I'm glad SIL can't come, let's roll with this date.\n\nYou can decide I'm the AH because I didn't raise hell or because I didn't reach out to SIL even though people told me not to or anything else that actually has a foundation in reality, but not on the basis of what you've decided to be true about the situation."]}
