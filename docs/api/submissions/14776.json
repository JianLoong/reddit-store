My sister brought a friend of hers I'd only met a few times that I've never had an issue with. At one point I went to the bathroom, and the ladies were in the living room, calmly enjoying wine. When I came out, my sister's friend was in the kitchen, arguing with my son. I asked her what she was doing.\n\nShe said my son went into the kitchen to get food, and she told him to wait until I came out of the bathroom to ask me for permission. I stared at her for a second and then said \"who the fuck are you? You don't live here. He does. Who are you to tell him he can't go in his own kitchen?\"\n\nShe looked surprised and said she was trying to be helpful. I repeated my question of why she thought it was okay to tell someone they can't use their own kitchen when she's a guest in someone else's house. She dodged the question and then brought up that she's a teacher, which isn't even relevant, and sometimes kids try to get around rules. I asked her what that has to do with anything. I then asked who even gave her permission to go in my kitchen.\n\nShe said she followed my son in. I said \"so you think my son needs permission to go in his own kitchen, but you can go wherever you like in my house without invitation? So you have more rights here than he does?\" She said she didn't feel welcome anymore and was leaving. She went back in the living room, grabbed her bag and walked out.\n\nMy sister asked what happened, and I explained that she had a disagreement with my son. My cousin and some of the other ladies said they thought it was strange she followed him into the kitchen and had been wondering why she did that, and thought her motive was weird as hell. My sister and a couple other ladies said her behavior was perfectly normal and I was unnecessarily hostile to her. My cousin said \"but why would you confront a child you don't know instead of saying something to the aunt who's right here? That's so weird.\"\n\nEveryone but my sister acknowledged that part was weird, and we all moved on. Later, my sister confronted me privately and said she was upset I \"chased off\" her friend. She said she really likes this woman, and that I was way over the top in the way I spoke to her. I can be a little extra when it comes to defending my kid, so was I an asshole?", "created_utc": 1681479390, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12lxjj6/aita_for_embarrassing_my_sisters_friend_and/", "score": 6678, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That friend is way out of line. She was in *your* house trying to boss around *your* son. If she was so concerned, she could have asked his aunt or, idk knocked on the bathroom door and asked you?

She didn't overstep the limits of acceptable behaviour. She hopped, skipped, and jumped over them", "Very strange situation. Your reaction is understandable and NTA, of course.

Sister\u2019s ex-bf got onto my kid for not letting his own kid play in her room. I told him that my kid lives here and he doesn\u2019t, so he can put up or shut up. He left and my sister got offended. Oh well.", "The friend was 1000% out of line NTA", "NTA She's one of *those* teachers", "NTA.

She is probably horrible to the kids she teaches.", "NTA\n\nA 10 year old is perfectly capable of sorting themselves out in their own kitchen. \n\nHer behaviour was strange and way out of line.

Grace for a stranger who gives themselves rights in your house and tries to restrict them from your child that lives there? Fuck. That. You could have cussed her out more and you\u2019d still be in the right.

WTF? \n\nNTA. What in the world was her thought process? She doesn't know you or your kid. I would have cursed at her too.", "NTA. Don\u2019t let anyone mess with your kid like that. You say it\u2019s not relevant that she\u2019s a teacher but I think that\u2019s the whole problem. I know teachers like this. They have an inborn need to control all the children. You could have left out the cussing but otherwise I\u2019m with you on this one", "NTA. For all the reasons already mentioned.

Immediate aggression and swearing at her seemed a little over the top, but I'm guessing you were caught off guard and reacted in the moment.  But she was being completely inappropriate, so I stand by the NTA.", "NTA. What a weirdo!", "NTA good on you for protecting your son, and your house, and for reals, what the fuck did she think she was doing.  I probably would've told her to get the fuck out before she decided to leave.", "NTA.  She was inappropriate and, frankly, her behavior was odd.", "NTA \n\nI can't even process what the hell she was thinking.\n\nThe everyone's sucks / you're an AH voters are the type of people you don't invite over. \ud83d\ude44", "NTA: Trying to wrap my mind around going into someone else's home and telling their children they can't get food. \n\nIt's super weird.", "NTA.

She is really strange Woman", "NTA\n\nShe was out of line and needed checked. Who does that in somebody else's house.", "NTA. Her behavior is fucking weird and I\u2019d have reacted the same way you did.

That's....insane. she refused to answer your question and then left when she couldn't figure out a good response anymore.\n\nHonestly, I would have taken it one step further and told her she's no longer welcome in my house and can leave.", "NTA. And no, if you explained it to them as you have explained it here then that is absolutely not normal. I would not have that woman back at my house OP.", "NTA for all the reasons you explained. I would not be okay with this if someone did it to my son and I\u2019ve never known someone to say no kids in the kitchen other than really little kids who try to use the stove", "Good job OP! This is what I wish my parents defended me instead of smiling when everybody thought it was their business to fatshame and teach me manners,mind you i was 15 by this point. And when i did confront them saying i didn't feel supported during those times,they just told me elders ought to be listened to and they wouldn't point out things if they didn't think it wasn't needed. So keep doing whatever you're doing cause now you're so knows you'll always have his back", "NTA\n\nPeople should think of it from the perspective of the 10 year old kid. How would you have felt being told off by a stranger in your own house? Food issues start as a kid and nobody needs policing of rules that don\u2019t exist in their own house. As someone said the kid being comfortable in the home comes before the adult stranger.\n\nEdit: Adult stranger could have just walked over to the sister and asked if the nephew could eat freely from the fridge rather than just say something to a kid she doesn\u2019t know as well", "That ''teacher'' sounds utterly creepy. I'm with you on this. Why would she follow him to the kitchen unless he asked her to be with him?...", "NTA.", "NTA.\n\nIs your sister romatically into this woman?  Or does she maybe have a problem making friends?\n\nI feel like you are totally right in your actions, but it reads as the sister feeling like she now had this person and now because of you its ruined.  \n\nEither way, it was your house and this woman was out of line", "NTA.  Perhaps it could have been done without cursing at her but her violation of your family space was pretty extreme and I don't blame you.  \n\nYour sister can hang out with her friend elsewhere.  I would not allow that person back into my home without her apology to me and willingness to apologize to my kid!", "NTA. Tell your sister to get better friends.", "NTA - If this lady was really concerned she should have just mentioned to you when you came out of the bathroom, \"Hey your son was looking for a snack in the kitchen\" or something like that so you'd be aware of him getting food but without making it a whole thing.", "Honestly she sounds more like a person who thinks it\u2019s her duty to watch children when parents are away, an overwhelming need to care for children. Teachers can be like that especially grade school or preschool teachers, they hover and feel others are ignoring child so they sub-parent,  I think she felt it was her duty to baby sit while mom was out of room. And feels child must be getting inappropriate food or junk food snacking, while mom isn\u2019t looking.  Some households are like this, no snacking between meals so when kids want something and mom is out of room\u2026they sneak junk.  The \u201cteacher\u201d probably thought that she was  doing a good thing.   DEFINITELY OUT OF LINE, definitely weird. To do this in a strangers home to a strangers kid.  D NTA,  but all the comments about the \u201cfriend\u201d. Being creepy or controlling.. I think has never met one of these types of hover teachers.  especially one who teach younger students.  While parents are not present they are ingrained to believe it\u2019s their duty to  sub-parent. Yeah it is weird to do it outside of a school or school related activity. But she may just have it so ingrained in her she can\u2019t \u201cturn it off\u201d   No OP is NTA.   But I think ya\u2019ll rush to judgment on the woman, just a bit.", "ESH\nIt\u2019s not wrong to correct her, but maybe \u201cwho the fuck are you?\u201d Shouldn\u2019t have been the first thing to leave your mouth. It sounds like she had good intentions and just wanted to make sure your son wasn\u2019t breaking any rules.\nThat being said, she was completely out of line following your child (whose age isn\u2019t specified, but I\u2019ll assume elementary school age) into the kitchen to confront him instead of saying something to his aunt in the same room, as others pointed out.\nWhat she did was wrong but you could have handled it better.", "You could have kept it peaceful. You could have said that your son didn\u2019t need your permission to get food. Instead you went from zero to 60, immediately. You must not like that person at all.", "NTA, though you could have just told her she was being inappropriate and left it at that. The way you handled it put the focus on your reaction instead of where it should have been - her overstepping.", "ESH. She overstepped her boundaries and didn\u2019t apologize.\n\nYou acted like psycho who *needed* her to feel bad or stupid. Or both.", "ESH - You are right that if she suspected something was wrong then she should have asked one of the other adults instead of directly confronting the child, but it sounds like you were quite aggressive and antagonistic about it. I think the \u201cwho the fuck do you think you are?\u201d attitude you took seems kinda toxic and overly hostile.", "INFO: how old is your son? A 4 year old trying to sneak treats vs a 10 year old getting himself a snack are different scenarios.", "NTA - although I don think you escalated it too quickly.  Just say something like, no, he has my permission to get food anytime and laugh.  She is totally an AH to assume she should be parenting your son like that, but you could have lightened up a bit with your response.  Still, totally NTA.", "A very gentle YTA. I'm amazed to see how quick not only you but a lot of posters here are to assume the worst about this guest's intentions. In a lot of cultures and communities there's more of an ethic that every adult will look out for every child and is welcome to intervene if they see a potential problem. And for sure, teachers do sometimes feel this kind of responsibility in my experience. I don't know; you were there, I wasn't, so maybe there was something really offensive about her manner toward your son, her tone of voice, something infuriating that's not obvious to me just by reading what you both said? If she was being rude or unkind to him then NTA for sure, and I admire your standing up for your son. But just from your words, anyway, I think it's possible she was trying to do (however unwelcome) a good thing by making sure you were aware of what your child was doing. And she was your guest, so she deserved the benefit of the doubt, at least to have one chance to understand what your house rules are. I think you could have handled it more politely instead of shaming her the way you did.", "NTA. Lady was weird as hell though like if your kid had to ask for things like that, why would it not occur to her that your sister and cousin would know that and that one of them would\u2019ve said something? Like she\u2019s a total stranger, even if you did require your child to ask for a snack, it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for her to attempt to enforce such a rule", "NTA this was not someone you invited to your house. she had no right to reprimand your son or wander around your house. even if she was your son teacher she still had no right.", "NTA - she was way out of line to a frankly ridiculous point, she doesn\u2019t get to parent your son", "NTA this is legit crazy person behavior.", "NTA! The friend's behavior was way out of line. You did the right thing by confronting her.", "NTA - and tell your sister that friend is not allowed back in your home.", "NTA\n\nIf your friends and family think how you handled it was bad, ooo hoo, they would not want to know how I would have handled someone (even my own husband) telling my child they needed permission to be in their own kitchen or to eat. You handled that in a much kinder way than I would have.", "NTA. Good on you for defending your son. He has every right to go into his own kitchen. She has no idea what rules you may have in your home and no right to try and enforce them to your child. I would have done the same thing. Tell your sister her friend can enforce your rule of not having sanctimonious, officious twits in your home.", "NTA Your house Your rules! This guest was out of line and your cousin wants to save face even if behavior is wrong.  No apology needed.", "NTA.\nI have major trouble staying in my lane and am always sticking my nose in if I see something I'm not sure is right, but if I was unsure my first instinct would be to ask the friend who invited me \"is he allowed ___\", NOT to go straight to assuming I know the rules best. Especially considering the friend was invited by the kids AUNT so she would have been a great person to ask about the usual rules, since she presumably knows him quite well and you weren't in the room. \n\nI can imagine if I knew a meal was being prepared for the kid and I saw them grabbing a ton of snacks, asking something like \"is he okay to have that many snacks this close to dinner?\". The only time I'd intervene without asking is if I saw something I thought was immediately dangerous, and even then if the parent came back and said the kid was actually fine to do that, I'd be super apologetic. Yes I'd be embarrassed and might want the earth to swallow me \ud83d\ude02 but that's my issue not yours", "NTA \n\nThat was weird. I wouldn't want that in my house.", "Info: how old is your son?", "NTA.  She would not have had the chance to leave in a huff.  I would have thrown her ass out.", "NTA that woman should have said sorry and took her ass back to the couch. Don\u2019t try to parent someone else\u2019s child in their own home.", "NTA and tell you sister her friend isn\u2019t welcome if she can\u2019t mind her manners and respect your boundaries. And if your sister doesn\u2019t like it, they can both stay gone.", "NTA. You don\u2019t know what a stranger will do to your kid. And telling him he can\u2019t eat without permission in his own home is kind of whack", "NTA. That woman was weird AF & stepped WAAAAYYYY over the line.", "NTA - That lady was crazy and had a lot of balls for confronting your child.", "NTA. If you don't pay rent/live there; you don't get to make/enforce the rules", "NTA wtf is going on in her mind to where she thinks she is the authority figure in someone else\u2019s home over someone else\u2019s child LOL \nHopefully she comes around and realizes it just a really silly situation and apologizes for her behavior so everyone can move on lol", "NTA. Your sisters relationship with her has nothing to do with your relationship with her.", "NTA!!!!!!! As a fellow parent no one is allowed to chastise your child unless they had explicit permission to do so (EG grandparents, uncles, aunts, etc) especially the friend of your sister. If anything I find the fact that she was incredibly creepy in following your son into the kitchen.\n\nUnfortunately it seems your sister needs a wake up call.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'm wondering why she even thought she'd be helping by telling the kid he has to wait for permission for food. I don't remember that being a thing in my house unless I wanted a treat like a Little Debbie or something else that my mom would have considered special like a soda.", "NTA  I'm a teacher too, so I get the urge to want to help \"keep an eye\" on kids. But this wasn't her house, nor was it any kind of an area where she had authority. She was a guest, and there were two adults present she could and should have defaulted to. You did nothing wrong by reminding her of that, and she should apologized as soon as you walked in instead of doubling down. Being a teacher doesn't give her authority over all kids in the world, and she needs to remember that. \n\nAlso, who cares if she felt unwelcomed? She made a child feel unwelcomed *in his own home.* That's unacceptable.", "NTA \n\nBeing a teacher doesn\u2019t give you the right to monitor all children everywhere. Yes it can be tough turning off the teacher instincts but when she\u2019s in someone else\u2019s house obviously if your son was doing something wrong anyone else there would have been next up to handle it. Not her, a total stranger to the child.", "Well... i mean, she was clearly wrong. Weirdly wrong. But if your first line is \"who the fuck are you?\", you're not helping her understand why what she did was so, so, so very weird.\n\nEdit: NTA", "Nta the friend is lucky it wasn't my house cuz I'd throw her ass out the door. Coming at my kid in their own house boggles my mind", "NTA. \u201cKids try to get around rules\u201d?? She doesn\u2019t even know the rules of your home, she doesn\u2019t know if your son has or not permission to grab whatever he wants from that kitchen.", "As I daughter that didn't get that kind of support, I know your son will trust you, be more open with you and know you got his back. Continue choosing your son over petty grownups.\n\nI wish my dad had stood up for me.", "NTA worry not op. The \"friend\" was totally in the wrong and may have been projecting some messed up childhood behavior on their end. They prob had to ask permission at their home so maybe out of some form of whether thinking it is status quo or wanting to do it to others? She followed the kid.", "NTA, but I hope your kid saw that exchange, I feel like I would remember that for the rest of my life in a positive way \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. I can\u2019t imagine trying to tell someone else\u2019s kid what they can and cannot do in their own home, especially when I don\u2019t know the host well.", "NTA and you just KNOW she\u2019s the kind of teacher who power trips over literal children all day long. The kind to say no to a kid asking to use the bathroom. Mean girl to teacher pipeline.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019d be peeved too. The simple solution would have been for \u2018friend\u2019 to mention it to you when you returned and let you deal with it as you saw fit. Why she thought she would be a better authority figure over you, your kid\u2019s aunt, or even your kid\u2019s cousin is beyond my comprehension. \n\nFriend has highly questionable motives and their over-reaction to your questions has me going \u201cWha\u2026?!\u201d In my head. \n\nAlso, sister is being weird about this- what does your relationship with friend have to do with hers? Why does she think her friend has a right to police her nephew in his own house?", "NTA - The only reason to intervene with someone else\u2019s kid is if there is clear and present danger. \n\nIf junior was reaching his hand towards a hot stove? Sure. Him walking into his own kitchen?  Nope.", "NTA being a teacher doesn\u2019t grant you rights to parent. That might be her safe area in a new place, like people with animals. But still", "NTA, not at all!!", "NTA. She needs to stay in her lane and stay out of other people's business.", "NTA and I wouldn't want to be a student of that teacher.", "My mom stood up for me many times as a kid to other adults who thought they were entitled to instruct/parent any child. Many adults view children as sub-human so it is challenging to advocate for yourself. There is a kind of righteous anger you feel as a kid and get \u201cin trouble\u201d for something your parents have always allowed you to do. I always appreciated my mom standing up for me and as a result I trusted her to support me and advocate for me. Great job, OP! You\u2019re child will remember this!", "ETA. She\u2019s a wack but you overreacted.", "NTA - Absolutely not!! You hit every nail that you needed to hit on the head. If she\u2019s a teacher, I am concerned about her being abusive to children. Even if her logic wasn\u2019t flawed, your child\u2019s mother was IN THE SAME HOUSE! Why would she involve herself in this situation. Are we sure she isn\u2019t some sort of sexual predator? Following your son into the kitchen is creepy!", "NTA whatsoever. That lady was way out of line and needs to stop giving shitty excuses about being a teacher. She was at your house - uninvited - so she shouldn't have even been there in the first place. You were right to defend your kid. I would have done the exact same thing. I hope she never steps foot at your place again.", "NTA. She did something embarrassing, and unwelcoming. If the shoe fits!", "Reading the title I thought you would be in the wrong, but oh my god i couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nNTA\n\nI'm not a parent, still in highschool, but if I was in that situation I would be so incredibly uncomfortable. She had no right to do that", "You were TAH only in terms of the over-the-top strength of how you confronted this lady. You had a teachable moment - for your son - that you missed.

My sister brought a friend of hers I'd only met a few times that I've never had an issue with. At one point I went to the bathroom, and the ladies were in the living room, calmly enjoying wine. When I came out, my sister's friend was in the kitchen, arguing with my son. I asked her what she was doing.\n\nShe said my son went into the kitchen to get food, and she told him to wait until I came out of the bathroom to ask me for permission. I stared at her for a second and then said \"who the fuck are you? You don't live here. He does. Who are you to tell him he can't go in his own kitchen?\"\n\nShe looked surprised and said she was trying to be helpful. I repeated my question of why she thought it was okay to tell someone they can't use their own kitchen when she's a guest in someone else's house. She dodged the question and then brought up that she's a teacher, which isn't even relevant, and sometimes kids try to get around rules. I asked her what that has to do with anything. I then asked who even gave her permission to go in my kitchen.\n\nShe said she followed my son in. I said \"so you think my son needs permission to go in his own kitchen, but you can go wherever you like in my house without invitation? So you have more rights here than he does?\" She said she didn't feel welcome anymore and was leaving. She went back in the living room, grabbed her bag and walked out.\n\nMy sister asked what happened, and I explained that she had a disagreement with my son. My cousin and some of the other ladies said they thought it was strange she followed him into the kitchen and had been wondering why she did that, and thought her motive was weird as hell. My sister and a couple other ladies said her behavior was perfectly normal and I was unnecessarily hostile to her. My cousin said \"but why would you confront a child you don't know instead of saying something to the aunt who's right here? That's so weird.\"\n\nEveryone but my sister acknowledged that part was weird, and we all moved on. Later, my sister confronted me privately and said she was upset I \"chased off\" her friend. She said she really likes this woman, and that I was way over the top in the way I spoke to her.
