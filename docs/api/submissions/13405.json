Although I'm in my 30s and have 2 kids, I've always struggled with being social. I have to admit that it can have negative impact but it's part of my personality and I'm glad everyone around me respects that and understands.\n\nHowever, My FMIL whom I met after meeting my current fiance, tends to make comments about me being awkward or overly shy. She always criticize me for it and often times she would bring it up inftont of everyone and make me feel anxious.\n\n\nMy fiance's birthday was yesterday. I'd put lots of work and preperation in order to fit in with the family and just be chill and normal. Everything was going well til we gathered at dinner table. My FBIL came to sit with us and pulled his chair too close to mine that our hips almost touched. I felt awkward, I got up and tried to pull my chair inches away from him. He didn't react but his mom (FMIL) was watching the whole thing and looked at me and said \"Good God! You're so uptight I bet you made your exhusband put a sheet over you each conception\" followed by a laugh. I was blown away completely. People actually laughed with her and I felt so upset. I quietly got up and took my stuff and walked out. My fiance followed me outside saying I overreacted and ruined his birthday over \"a joke\". I was so upset we got into a huge argumrnt then I insisted to go home.\n\n\nHe came back hours later yelling about how I ruined his birthday and made a scene inftont of his family. He said he was sick and tired if my uptightness and that I need to loosen up and stop acting childishly. His mom called and he's now refusing to speak to me unless I apologize to him and his mom for storming out like that since his mom was just \"giving her opinion in a funny way\" and this is how she is.", "created_utc": 1680021787, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124urb6/aita_for_walking_out_during_my_fiances_birthday/", "score": 3953, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hell, he is more worried about his birthday getting \u201cruined\u201d than how any of that nonsense made you feel. What a child. \n\nAs a socially awkward introvert (to an admitted fault, in that I need to get help for it at some point as it does impact my quality of life, which is ultimately my responsibility), this alone would be close to being a dealbreaker for me in a relationship.

He didn\u2019t talk to them for  almost 7 months until they realized either they respect me as a person and what I\u2019m comfortable with or he\u2019ll make the decision of what makes him happier.

I personally probably wouldn't have left over this comment, but it really is not your job to be essentially sexually harassed at your fianc\u00e9's birthday dinner (imagine if your FFIL or FBIL said this because you merely moved to have more space, it would be so creepo). Your FMIL is the one who ruined your fianc\u00e9s birthday. \n\nI would seriously reconsider whether you will be able to deal with your fianc\u00e9 choosing his inappropriate family over you for the rest of your life, because that is where your relationship is headed.", "NTA and this is going to be your life if you marry him.

The moment he says: \"I'm sick and tired of ...\" there is already a conflict that you and him need to solve before you get married, you should really think hard if that is a family you want to marry into.", "NTA but everyone else here is. Leave.", "NTA. Girl, run.", "NTA\n\nYour fiance is not a good life partner- partners are people with similar goals that pair up to complete those life goals together as a team.  If he isn't on your side- then you're not functioning as a team.\n\nYou were a guest in someone else's home/event- and instead of being welcoming/accommodating of you they took the first opportunity to make you the butt of their joke.  That makes them terrible hosts, and completely unaccommodating.\n\nInstead of recognizing you were publicly humiliated, your fiance came to his mother's defense over yours.  How are you supposed to build a life with someone that prioritizes other people and their feelings over yours?  (Children being the only reasonable exception to priorities).", "NTA.  It's only a joke if both parties think it's funny.  You don't have anything to apologize for, and your fianc\u00e9 is an AH for not backing you up.  If you do marry this guy, I would tell his mother that your introvertness or awkwardness around people is not open for discussion or comments.  If she doesn't abide by this, I would leave like you just did.", "NTA, FMIL sounds like a hot mess. The fact that the fiance didn't defend you about your social anxiety says a lot since he out of all people should have understood and cut the FMIL cut dry after that remark. You might need to have a long sit down with him and make decisions that best suit you", "NTA. It doesn't make much sense that FMIL needs your apologies because she gets to be who she is - while you, apparently, can't be who you are.\n\nThis is not a match for you.

The fact that your fianc\u00e9 is blaming you instead of defending you against his mom\u2019s weird sexual comments is red flag city.", "NTA. Humiliating someone to get a laugh out of others is not ok. Also I see her barreling past boundaries to inappropriately jab about ones sex life.\n\nNot one person put themselves in your position to see out it would feel to be on the receiving end of those apathetic, dehumanizing comments.\n\nFMIL was out of line. I find it concerning that no one even tried to empathize with you to understand your perspective. \n\nSo here\u2019s what I thought when reading her inappropriate comments to you: \u201cI picture FMIL\u2019s sex life as someone making obnoxiously loud barnyard noises.\u201d", "NTA, but this has nothing to do with being an introvert. Your former FMIL doesn't like you and doesn't want you around. To your husband, you are nothing more than an accessory, something he takes with him when he visits others.  He does not care about you at all.  In fact, he doesn't see you at all.\n\nPlease run from this. Completely ignore your obsession with others' feelings and take a very close look at how YOU  feel right now. Is this how you want to feel for the rest of your life?\n\nTake it from someone who realized this way too late.  RUN!!!", "NTA\n\nAs an introvert myself if someone weaponized it to make a cheap joke like this, I know I'd be upset. The fact Husband is putting Mom over you is a tad bit concerning: You think he'd be worried that his wife felt pressured to leave instead of how you put a wrinkle in his party. (He's 30, right? Is he really saying his party is 'ruined'? I think I said that when I was 12 and a relative literally shoved his face into my cake.)\n\nHusband has some priorities he has to sort out, I think.", "NTA but your fiance and his family are TOXIC.

They all owe you an apology, not the other way around.", "NTA please listen to what he's telling you and leave this relationship.", "NTA speaking as a MIL WTF? I would never speak to my son in law like that. My daughter has OCD that she manages without meds. There are certain accommodations that she makes not dissimilar to quietly moving her chair. One has to be watching pretty closely to notice, and one has to be a total AH to care or comment. \nYou fianc\u00e9e needs to have your back verbally and in practice (i.e., walk out with you)  If he doesn't move on.

These people have no respect for you and your person.  I have had plenty of family that is quiet, we don't shame them for it and we most definitely do not make crass statements like this.  The immaturity level is off the charts.  At 30 years old he should know better and his mom definitely should.  Do not stay with a man who treats you like this around his family or in private.  He should have called her out, instead it's like laughing when a child says a curse word.  Yeah, it's cute in the moment until they yell it out in an inappropriate setting.", "NTA.

Fmil is now goi g to be meaner than ever because she is not a nice person", "NTA. That was not a joke, what your FMIL said was judgmental, offensive, and incredibly inappropriate.

The fact your fianc\u00e9 not only invalidates your feelings but outright supports his family\u2019s mistreatment towards you is not ok. \n\nIt is not on you to \u201cloosen up\u201d, it is on your fianc\u00e9 to grow up, understand that everyone is different, and learn to respect those differences. It doesn\u2019t even sound like your fianc\u00e9 loves you for who you are. Is this really the future you want for yourself? A childish man who throws tantrums and violates your comfort level to conform to his ignorant standards? A man who puts his mother above his future wife? Who belittles you and tries to control you? That\u2019s not to mention his family, who you\u2019ll have a lovely lifetime of commentary from, should you marry into them. \n\nIt is much easier, and significantly cheaper, to break an engagement than it is to divorce.

FMIL is purposely causing arguments between you and your fianc\u00e9. It\u2019s working so no incentive for her to stop at this point.

My friend is from a large, loud family (think 40 people at dinner, yelling, laughing, so much loudness). His brother met a nice girl who is what we would call \"painfully shy.\" She is so shy that when her and I were doing dishes- I had met her twice- and I asked her question (like how is the weather level) she looked at me, stared, and went back to doing dishes. What does this large, loud family do with her? They could give a shit. She wanders off, they let her wander. She sits at the table, they ask her to pass the peas, she is quiet all night, they move around her. Of course they engage with her, but they never pick at her, follow her around, or judge her. She is bit more open now, but she is just not in to social interaction, so holidays she goes in to a guest room, they let her be, they don't ask her a 1,000 questions or force her to interact. When a newer person meets her and maybe is a little too extra with her, my friend's mom just says \"Oh X is a bit shy, leave her be\" or redirects them. \n\nShe is fully accepted and cared for in the family she has joined.

Although I'm in my 30s and have 2 kids, I've always struggled with being social. I have to admit that it can have negative impact but it's part of my personality and I'm glad everyone around me respects that and understands.\n\nHowever, My FMIL whom I met after merting my current fiance, tends to make comments about me being awkward or overly shy. She always criticize me for it and often times she would bring it up inftont of everyone and make me feel anxious.\n\n\nMy fiance's birthday was yesterday. I'd put lots of work and preperation in order to fit in with the family and just be chill and normal. Everything was going well til we gathered at dinner table. My FBIL came to sit with us and pulled his chair too close to mine that our hips almost touched. I felt awkward, I got up and tried to pull my chair inches away from him. He didn't react but his mom (FMIL) was watching the whole thing and looked at me and said \"Good God! You're so uptight I bet you made your exhusband put a sheet over you each conception\" followed by a laugh. I was blown away completely. People actually laughed with her and I felt so upset. I quietly got up and took my stuff and walked out. My fiance followed me outside saying I overreacted and ruined his birthday over \"a joke\". I was so upset we got into a huge argumrnt then I insisted to go home.\n\n\nHe came back hours later yelling about how I ruined his birthday and made a scene inftont of his family. He said he was sick and tired if my uptightness and that I need to loosen up and stop acting childishly. His mom called and he's now refusing to speak to me unless I apologize to him and his mom for storming out like that since his mom was just \"giving her opinion in a funny way\" and this is how she is.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

These are not your people.  They know about your anxiety and purposefully  exploit that to shame you in public and then double down trying  to make you appologize for enforcing your boundaries.  Again: These are not your people.  You will never feel safe around them because they do not want you to feel safe around them.  If they liked you they would treat you in a way that made you feel safe.  Instead they taunt you.  They are bullies and your fiance agrees with the bullies.  I'm sorry you are going through this.

The second person starts moving again and the first person once more tells them when they get too close.

You need to find someone who not only accepts you for you, but appreciates who you are. Totally NTA.", "He repeated his mother\u2019s language and called the OP uptight. I think OP you should be glad he is not talking to you. NTA.", "They aren\u2019t interested in \u201cfault\u201d they know she very sensitive and they are f***ing with her.", "NTA- The only apology you should give them is \"I'm sorry you and your family are so uneducated on social anxiety and mistake social anxiety for uprightness. I'm sorry you're too ignorant to educate yourselves. I'm not sorry that I got to see that uneducated ignorance before we got married so we won't have a messy divorce\" \n\n\nI have social anxiety as well and barely like being touched even by my own family. So I completely understand feeling awkward or uncomfortable when it's time to be social. It doesn't make you uptight and if your future husband doesn't understand that you need to get out of this relationship now, especially if he's letting his family talk to you like that. Also someone who demands an apology. \n\nPlease get out now, before any more verbal and mental abuse from them gets worse and it makes your social anxiety worse.", "He YELLED at you? \n\nAside from him not understanding how inappropriate the joke felt to you, and DEMANDING and apology, the fact that he came back, not to talk and understand how you were feeling or to reach a middle ground, this man came to YELL and DEMAND.\n\nNTA \n\nBut please reconsider how many times you will have to deal with this types of situations in your future.", "Pay attention he is showing you he isn't too much different from his asshole mother. Believe him. NTA", "NTA. Dump this guy now!", "DTMFA!\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntoo bizarre! His mom is  real gem here - and he's just tole you he'll take her side.....and this is before a wedding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't do it!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "This would be a dealbreaker for me. The fact that he came back yelling at you because his own mother made a crass and inappropriate comment regarding your previous sexual relations shows he isn\u2019t really ever going to be in your corner. If you really want to marry this mummasboy I would learn to grow a backbone and give back as good as mil gives it. \nDon\u2019t apologise, I\u2019d double down and tell her to go fuck herself.. with the covers off because she has no dignity.", "Honey, your fianc\u00e9 is not a red or maroon flag, he is borderline ABUSIVE. Yelling at you for making a scene when his mom straight-up insulted you shows blatant signs of emotional abuse. Being a single mom doesn't make these people entitled to your submission. The safest option will be to leave as soon as possible. \n\nNot to mention the BIL sounds like a perv.", "NTA run woman don't walk!", "I also think that even if the FBIL wasn't a part of a set-up, it's definitely weird (and gross) that he'd sit that close to her. I believe 99% of the time women instinctively know when a man is being creepy. She was just protecting herself based on decades of experience as a woman. Also definitely NTA.", "Maybe a set up, or maybe FMIL is a gossip who\u2019s said that same line to whoever would listen over and over again while crap talking OP", "Refer to my other comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124urb6/aita_for_walking_out_during_my_fiances_birthday/je3ckiu?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3", "They are eating at a restaurant and OP gave zero info on just how many people were sitting at the table. The table could very well be stocked full of people and there qas little to no room between the seats. We don't know. \n\nBut to go off an entire rant that this was a setup just seems like a far reach. Along with saying there is no way this was an accident is wild. We have zero information to go on about any of that, no even an incling from OP that FBIL did it maliciously.", "It seems you have stemmed away from the original point/post. \n\nWith regards to your previous comment, I don't know know what to say to someone who has no inference skills. If you read my comment and couldn't ObViOuSlY infer I was referring to OP's husband not defending OP when she hadn't done anything wrong and supporting her against MIL then, well, that's on you.", "I literally just covered this stuff. Just say you didn't bother to read it and go.", ">Not having your SOs back should be a crime.\n\nYou made a claim that a perfectly reasonable thing to do in a wide variety of situations should be made illegal. You carved out zero exceptions. This was incredibly explicit.\n\nI know exactly what you meant. The problem is that what you meant isn't actually what you said. Had you said \"the fiance is an asshole\" (which is actually the whole point of this subreddit) or \"it's wrong and shitty to not have your partner's back when they haven't done anything wrong and people are being cruel to them\", I wouldn't have taken issue with that in the slightest.\n\nBut instead of doing that, you said that a potentially reasonable and good action should be legally prohibited. You said that action should result in the involvement of the legal system. This was unwise and ridiculous for all the previously listed reasons.\n\nMy ability to make inferences is perfectly intact, I only wish I could say the same about your willingness to just *say what you actually mean* instead of jumping to criminalize shit (an instinct which has actually caused a great deal of harm on numerous occasions and persists far beyond an annoying reddit comment.)", "So much easier to break an engagement than get a divorce.", "Because it's one to thing to just scoot a chair an inch to the side.

I have thicker skin because my family is ridiculous and I am considered shy to them even though I am not to other people \u2026.but everyone is raised differently and have a different set of social rules. I make it very clear to my partners that my family is tough\u2026 I would never encourage bullying or mocking my partner but honestly you can\u2019t be around my family and be sensitive or shy because they don\u2019t accept that well. Honestly I would not bring a shy person around them who couldn\u2019t handle their poor behaviors. Yet, this is the family I was assigned too and I love them so being honest upfront and finding compromise can help or just realizing it won\u2019t work if the person is horrified by them.
