Although I'm in my 30s and have 2 kids, I've always struggled with being social. I have to admit that it can have negative impact but it's part of my personality and I'm glad everyone around me respects that and understands.\n\nHowever, My FMIL whom I met after meeting my current fiance, tends to make comments about me being awkward or overly shy. She always criticize me for it and often times she would bring it up inftont of everyone and make me feel anxious.\n\n\nMy fiance's birthday was yesterday. I'd put lots of work and preperation in order to fit in with the family and just be chill and normal. Everything was going well til we gathered at dinner table. My FBIL came to sit with us and pulled his chair too close to mine that our hips almost touched. I felt awkward, I got up and tried to pull my chair inches away from him. He didn't react but his mom (FMIL) was watching the whole thing and looked at me and said \"Good God! You're so uptight I bet you made your exhusband put a sheet over you each conception\" followed by a laugh. I was blown away completely. People actually laughed with her and I felt so upset. I quietly got up and took my stuff and walked out. My fiance followed me outside saying I overreacted and ruined his birthday over \"a joke\". I was so upset we got into a huge argumrnt then I insisted to go home.\n\n\nHe came back hours later yelling about how I ruined his birthday and made a scene inftont of his family. He said he was sick and tired if my uptightness and that I need to loosen up and stop acting childishly. His mom called and he's now refusing to speak to me unless I apologize to him and his mom for storming out like that since his mom was just \"giving her opinion in a funny way\" and this is how she is.", "created_utc": 1680021787, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124urb6/aita_for_walking_out_during_my_fiances_birthday/", "score": 286, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hell, he is more worried about his birthday getting \u201cruined\u201d than how any of that nonsense made you feel. What a child. \n\nAs a socially awkward introvert (to an admitted fault, in that I need to get help for it at some point as it does impact my quality of life, which is ultimately my responsibility), this alone would be close to being a dealbreaker for me in a relationship.

He didn\u2019t talk to them for  almost 7 months until they realized either they respect me as a person and what I\u2019m comfortable with or he\u2019ll make the decision of what makes him happier.

I personally probably wouldn't have left over this comment, but it really is not your job to be essentially sexually harassed at your fianc\u00e9's birthday dinner (imagine if your FFIL or FBIL said this because you merely moved to have more space, it would be so creepo). Your FMIL is the one who ruined your fianc\u00e9s birthday. \n\nI would seriously reconsider whether you will be able to deal with your fianc\u00e9 choosing his inappropriate family over you for the rest of your life, because that is where your relationship is headed.", "NTA and this is going to be your life if you marry him.

The moment he says: \"I'm sick and tired of ...\" there is already a conflict that you and him need to solve before you get married, you should really think hard if that is a family you want to marry into.", "NTA but everyone else here is. Leave.", "NTA. Girl, run.", "NTA\n\nYour fiance is not a good life partner- partners are people with similar goals that pair up to complete those life goals together as a team.  If he isn't on your side- then you're not functioning as a team.\n\nYou were a guest in someone else's home/event- and instead of being welcoming/accommodating of you they took the first opportunity to make you the butt of their joke.  That makes them terrible hosts, and completely unaccommodating.\n\nInstead of recognizing you were publicly humiliated, your fiance came to his mother's defense over yours.  How are you supposed to build a life with someone that prioritizes other people and their feelings over yours?  (Children being the only reasonable exception to priorities).", "NTA.  It's only a joke if both parties think it's funny.  You don't have anything to apologize for, and your fianc\u00e9 is an AH for not backing you up.  If you do marry this guy, I would tell his mother that your introvertness or awkwardness around people is not open for discussion or comments.  If she doesn't abide by this, I would leave like you just did.", "NTA, FMIL sounds like a hot mess. The fact that the fiance didn't defend you about your social anxiety says a lot since he out of all people should have understood and cut the FMIL cut dry after that remark. You might need to have a long sit down with him and make decisions that best suit you", "NTA. It doesn't make much sense that FMIL needs your apologies because she gets to be who she is - while you, apparently, can't be who you are.\n\nThis is not a match for you.

The fact that your fianc\u00e9 is blaming you instead of defending you against his mom\u2019s weird sexual comments is red flag city.", "NTA. Humiliating someone to get a laugh out of others is not ok. Also I see her barreling past boundaries to inappropriately jab about ones sex life.\n\nNot one person put themselves in your position to see out it would feel to be on the receiving end of those apathetic, dehumanizing comments.\n\nFMIL was out of line. I find it concerning that no one even tried to empathize with you to understand your perspective. \n\nSo here\u2019s what I thought when reading her inappropriate comments to you: \u201cI picture FMIL\u2019s sex life as someone making obnoxiously loud barnyard noises.\u201d", "NTA, but this has nothing to do with being an introvert. Your former FMIL doesn't like you and doesn't want you around. To your husband, you are nothing more than an accessory, something he takes with him when he visits others.  He does not care about you at all.  In fact, he doesn't see you at all.\n\nPlease run from this. Completely ignore your obsession with others' feelings and take a very close look at how YOU  feel right now. Is this how you want to feel for the rest of your life?\n\nTake it from someone who realized this way too late.  RUN!!!", "NTA\n\nAs an introvert myself if someone weaponized it to make a cheap joke like this, I know I'd be upset. The fact Husband is putting Mom over you is a tad bit concerning: You think he'd be worried that his wife felt pressured to leave instead of how you put a wrinkle in his party. (He's 30, right? Is he really saying his party is 'ruined'? I think I said that when I was 12 and a relative literally shoved his face into my cake.)\n\nHusband has some priorities he has to sort out, I think.", "NTA but your fiance and his family are TOXIC.

They all owe you an apology, not the other way around.", "NTA please listen to what he's telling you and leave this relationship.", "NTA speaking as a MIL WTF? I would never speak to my son in law like that. My daughter has OCD that she manages without meds. There are certain accommodations that she makes not dissimilar to quietly moving her chair. One has to be watching pretty closely to notice, and one has to be a total AH to care or comment. \nYou fianc\u00e9e needs to have your back verbally and in practice (i.e., walk out with you)  If he doesn't move on.

These people have no respect for you and your person.  I have had plenty of family that is quiet, we don't shame them for it and we most definitely do not make crass statements like this.  The immaturity level is off the charts.  At 30 years old he should know better and his mom definitely should.  Do not stay with a man who treats you like this around his family or in private.  He should have called her out, instead it's like laughing when a child says a curse word.  Yeah, it's cute in the moment until they yell it out in an inappropriate setting.", "NTA.

Fmil is now goi g to be meaner than ever because she is not a nice person", "NTA. That was not a joke, what your FMIL said was judgmental, offensive, and incredibly inappropriate.

The fact your fianc\u00e9 not only invalidates your feelings but outright supports his family\u2019s mistreatment towards you is not ok. \n\nIt is not on you to \u201cloosen up\u201d, it is on your fianc\u00e9 to grow up, understand that everyone is different, and learn to respect those differences. It doesn\u2019t even sound like your fianc\u00e9 loves you for who you are. Is this really the future you want for yourself? A childish man who throws tantrums and violates your comfort level to conform to his ignorant standards? A man who puts his mother above his future wife? Who belittles you and tries to control you? That\u2019s not to mention his family, who you\u2019ll have a lovely lifetime of commentary from, should you marry into them. \n\nIt is much easier, and significantly cheaper, to break an engagement than it is to divorce.

FMIL is purposely causing arguments between you and your fianc\u00e9. It\u2019s working so no incentive for her to stop at this point.

The only people who ruined the party were the rude mother and your fiance for not checking her. \n\nFMIL is trying to break you down. She knows you are shy so she embarrasses you in front of everyone, so now you get anxious, and then she mocks that too. Your fiance sees it and allows it to happen, and not only doesn't stick up for you but thinks his mother is right to treat you that way.

You deserve to feel safe, loved and respected, and your fiance is not creating that environment for you. \n\nLet me give you a clearer picture. My friend is from a large, loud family (think 40 people at dinner, yelling, laughing, so much loudness). His brother met a nice girl who is what we would call \"painfully shy.\" She is so shy that when her and I were doing dishes- I had met her twice- and I asked her question (like how is the weather level) she looked at me, stared, and went back to doing dishes. What does this large, loud family do with her? They could give a shit. She wanders off, they let her wander. She sits at the table, they ask her to pass the peas, she is quiet all night, they move around her. Of course they engage with her, but they never pick at her, follow her around, or judge her. She is bit more open now, but she is just not in to social interaction, so holidays she goes in to a guest room, they let her be, they don't ask her a 1,000 questions or force her to interact. When a newer person meets her and maybe is a little too extra with her, my friend's mom just says \"Oh X is a bit shy, leave her be\" or redirects them. \n\nShe is fully accepted and cared for in the family she has joined. You deserve that too, as do your children, and do not settle for anything less.", "As an introvert, I also always feel awkward in social situations, to the point of having social anxiety.

This is not a situation where an extrovert is making a comment about introverts. Your future MIL is purposefully trying to embarrass you and drive a wedge. If your fianc\u00e9 is not standing up for you and defending you to his mother, do NOT go forward with marrying this man, and his family! \n\nIf you do marry him, this will be your life.

Although I'm in my 30s and have 2 kids, I've always struggled with being social. I have to admit that it can have negative impact but it's part of my personality and I'm glad everyone around me respects that and understands.\n\nHowever, My FMIL whom I met after merting my current fiance, tends to make comments about me being awkward or overly shy. She always criticize me for it and often times she would bring it up inftont of everyone and make me feel anxious.\n\n\nMy fiance's birthday was yesterday. I'd put lots of work and preperation in order to fit in with the family and just be chill and normal. Everything was going well til we gathered at dinner table. My FBIL came to sit with us and pulled his chair too close to mine that our hips almost touched. I felt awkward, I got up and tried to pull my chair inches away from him. He didn't react but his mom (FMIL) was watching the whole thing and looked at me and said \"Good God! You're so uptight I bet you made your exhusband put a sheet over you each conception\" followed by a laugh. I was blown away completely. People actually laughed with her and I felt so upset. I quietly got up and took my stuff and walked out. My fiance followed me outside saying I overreacted and ruined his birthday over \"a joke\". I was so upset we got into a huge argumrnt then I insisted to go home.\n\n\nHe came back hours later yelling about how I ruined his birthday and made a scene inftont of his family. He said he was sick and tired if my uptightness and that I need to loosen up and stop acting childishly. His mom called and he's now refusing to speak to me unless I apologize to him and his mom for storming out like that since his mom was just \"giving her opinion in a funny way\" and this is how she is.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That these people agree with each other and will stand with each other about what the reality is and who is right and wrong regardless of anyone elses feelings or perceptions.  Recognize that this is who these people are.  I steer clear of anyone that abuses people and says \"that's just who I am\" as if that excuses thier behavior.  You cannot change them. These are not your people.  They know about your anxiety and purposefully  exploit that to shame you in public and then double down trying  to make you appologize for enforcing your boundaries.  Again: These are not your people.  You will never feel safe around them because they do not want you to feel safe around them.  If they liked you they would treat you in a way that made you feel safe.  Instead they taunt you.  They are bullies and your fiance agrees with the bullies.  I'm sorry you are going through this.  You can't argue this or cry this right.  All you can do is be firm and take care of yourself.  Don't sign yourself up for a life of this.", "NTA- Maybe self reflect on this relationship. Could you put up with a lifetime of this crap?", "In addition to the obvious sexually insulting joke, there is an undertone of disrespect against you for bringing 2 kids into the relationship.

Instead, he is standing with his family against you. It will only get worse if you stay. NTA", "NTA! Get the heck out of that family. I would NEVER let my mother make a joke like that about my partner, that's incredibly inappropriate and rude!", "Yikes. NTA. Why is she bringing up your ex? Why is she bringing up your ex in a sexual way? These people have no boundaries and I don't think you want these people in your future or your kids lives. It sucks that you're already engaged, better a broken engagement than another divorce or worse; kids with these weirdos. Good luck!", "you should not be marrying this person", "NTA, I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you.

I'm not one to tell people to leave their relationships because it's not my place but I seriously recommend you ask yourself if you really want to marry this man. a partner who truly loves you will defend you against their family who bullies you like this. when you get married to someone, you become their closest family, so they need to have your back, and he clearly does not care about having yours.", "NTA i think you know you need to end this relationship.

You had every right to leave a situation where you are being picked on in such a grotesque fashion.

No, it was his mom that ruined it with her disgusting potty mouth and bad attitude. You are always allowed to stick up for yourself.", "I can guarantee you they mock you behind your back. The MIL not understanding is excusable, though being an AH about it isn't. You partner though, he doesn't understand and doesn't seem to care enough about you to even try. I might want to reassess  marrying into this family. I doesn't sound like they like you at all.", "NTA. Not funny", "NTA his mum gets a kick from humiliating you and your partner should have defended you.

You're so uptight I bet you made your exhusband put a sheet over you each conception\"\n\nHoly shit, OP. This is so incredibly inappropriate and out of line for her to say. I cannot fathom why she would attempt to shame you like this. NTA, at all. And I would second guess even marrying into this family, especially given that your fiance is not sticking up for you. \n\nIt sounds like you might be signing up for a lifetime of his mother trying to make you feel small and embarrassed, until she dies. Are you ready to sign up for that? I sure wouldn't.\n\nIt almost sounds like she just doesn't like you, and wants to make your time miserable. Is she the kind of mom who over-mothers her adult son, and maybe she feels like you're \"stealing\" him from her now? Her comment about your ex-husband and your conception(s) makes me think she has a problem with the fact that you're not a virgin bride. It ALSO makes me think that she'd have a problem with you even if you were the perfect chaste virgin for her son. She'd find other things to pick on you for. And she sounds awful. I could not marry into a family like that.\n\nAnd not all MILs are like that. Like, MILs can be annoying and it can be frustrating working out the dynamic that works best for everyone.
