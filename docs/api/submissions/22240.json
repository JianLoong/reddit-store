We only grew up around each other until I was 8, my mom left my dad and took my sister only. A few years later sister went to college and had her own life. \n\nMy sister has always been a stuck up, self centered person. Our mom is severely mentally ill and once my sister left she cut my mom off & I was stuck having to deal with it by myself. Walking her home in the middle of the night, cleaning her apartment out, having to deal with her hair when it became infested with lice, forcing her to shower. I was only 12/13 at the time. I became a mom at 17 and my sister would always talk down to me when she came around. She would brag about how she\u2019s the only one in the family to go to college, she has a condo in LA, has such a great life without kids, told me I ruined my life, I was bound for a life on welfare etc. I ended up going NC with her. \n\nWell 2 years ago I got an inheritance of 7 figures from a relative on my dads side. The family member gave it specifically to me because she knew what I had to deal with growing up and she was proud that I stepped up cared for my mom. Since then, i got married to my kids dad, we bought a home in a nice neighborhood, have new cars, made investments and live a good life. \n\nMy sister ended up calling me from a blocked number one day and said she was in town and wanted to talk. I give her my address and when she gets to my house, she\u2019s upset. She asked me if this was my house and how did I afford this. She started hounding me on where I got all this money. I didn\u2019t want to tell her because it\u2019s not her business and my husband and I make 6 figures on our own, so I just told her it was from us saving and our jobs. She broke down crying that she is living in the projects and her and her husband are unemployed and they are broke. She\u2019s on welfare and only gets $50 a month for food. My kids ended up walking in and she didn\u2019t even know their names or acknowledge them and she made a rude comment about my sons behavior (he\u2019s autistic). I ended up telling her we had someplace to go so she would leave. \n\nA few weeks later she calls me again, screaming at me, that she found out through a relative about the inheritance and how dare I not offer her any help and why she didn\u2019t get any of it. I told her it has nothing to do with her and we got in an argument and I told her she should use her \u201cdegree\u201d to get a job. She told me she\u2019s going to sue me for the money, I just hung up on her at that point. \n\nI reached out to a relative and they\u2019re saying I\u2019m an AH for not giving her a portion of it especially now that she\u2019s broke. I explained to them the reason I even got it is because I took care of my mom and the relative wrote in her will and the trust that the money only goes to me so there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.

So your sister wants to benefit from her abandonment of you.  Does that make sense?  Not in my book.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that you put on your big girl panties at a very young age and did what needed to be done.   You should be proud of this.  Your sister should be ashamed of herself.  \n\nLast but not least, if you give your sister money now, you will be giving it to her forever.  Don't do it!

Seriously doubt it, especially since the benefactor is on your fathers side and not related to your sister.  Plus she\u2019s got to find a lawyer that will work pro bono and there are very few probate attorneys that will take money later (especially with an iffy outcome).  For your own peace of mind, spend an hour with a probate attorney and find out if she has any leg to stand on since some states have weird archaic laws and loopholes.\n\nI\u2019m curious where did that great job and condo go?    Either it never existed or there\u2019s an addiction draining the money.  If it\u2019s the latter, doesn\u2019t matter how much you give her, it\u2019ll be swallowed by the addiction and she\u2019ll want more.\n\nYou\u2019re not the AH for prioritizing your family.  She\u2019s a grown woman that has taken care of herself in the past and can do so again.  And if your relative starts in on you, then the response is \u201coh, how kind of you\u2026I\u2019ll send her your number right away so you can arrange to cover her bills\u201d.", "NTA.  She is not related to your dad.  She has no right to money given to you by that side of the family.  She also would not have rights to anything your mom left/leaves to you either.  That gold digger can pound sand", "Thank you for that! Means a lot:)", "Most of our \u201cfamily\u201d dislike me because they all have reached out asking for money and I refused to do so. Nobody cared about me until the $ came.  \n\nI have a big heart and I will help those who I feel deserve it and so far nobody has gotten a dime. I bought myself a home and better transportation. Everything else is in funds for my parents who will need care eventually, my kids, specifically my son who needs therapy and who knows what else down the road, and for retirement. I laughed when she said that too the entitlement is real..", "From what I know, she made an impulsive decision to move out of state and they\u2019ve had no luck finding employment for a while now. \n\nI didn\u2019t write this in the text, but my sister was \u201cadopted\u201d by her former teacher, who is very well off. Theyve taken her on trips to Hawaii, out of the country, they paid for her college, paid for her wedding and other things. She\u2019s been very fortunate, where I have not. I\u2019m not sure why she can\u2019t ask them for help or what their relationship is like now. It\u2019s not in my heart to be mean and I don\u2019t want to see my sister struggling, and it hurts me to be like this but she has never apologized or seen a problem with her behavior. And after seeing me for the first time in years, all she did was have her hand out asking for money. But that was my fault for being naive, all I can do is wish her the best and cut ties", "Why TF should she want to bridge a relationship with this manipulative, selfish, narcissistic, entitled, uncaring, guilt tripping, disgusting human that\u2019s has done nothing but treat her like shit? Because \u201cfamily is family\u201d? No way, throw that toxic sister, and the family member supporting this bullshit behavior, out with the trash.", "The family member that gave me the money was a very kind woman and she had her accountant/financial guy reach out to me and walk me through everything. He gave me his lawyer friends number that deals with this as well. He gave me a warning this would happen, everyone would come out of the wood works with their hands out. There was a lot of outrage that I was the only one who received it but he confirmed what you said that none of them would win the case, everything was documented since I was a teenager and there wasn\u2019t any random changes before she passed so there\u2019s no way anyone\u2019s entitled to the money. \n\nI explained to another commenter why she lost everything if you want to read it. But either way I\u2019m not intimidated and this only gives me the reassurance I need to just cut ties and move on. It hurts to turn my back on people but damn if this isn\u2019t a lesson to be kind to people, especially if you might need their help down the road, then idk what is.", "Glad to hear you got solid advice from the jump.  Unfortunately, most people I know that come into money immediately are bombarded by open hands.  And too many start filling those hands to be shocked that it\u2019s never enough.  \n\nYou\u2019re doubly NTA for making sure the money is tied into investments to cover the future for your parents and kids.\n\nI still don\u2019t believe the \u201ccan\u2019t find a job\u201d story.  If she\u2019s got a degree, she can substitute teach to make enough to pay rent.  Tons of places hiring in retail or food service.  Not the pay you want, but if it\u2019s covering groceries, you suck it up until you do find something in field.  Something doesn\u2019t add up there.  But good news, it\u2019s not your problem!  She\u2019s figured it out this long, she can figure it out in the future.\n\nThe people that honestly love you will support you and your decision to prioritize your family over someone else.  The people that don\u2019t\u2026well, that\u2019s why block buttons are built in."]}
