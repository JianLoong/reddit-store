Sylvia has twin girls who are 4 years old now. When she got pregnant, her boyfriend broke up with her and moved to another county. She was really heartbroken and had post natal depression so the entire family took turns taking care of her babies for the first year or so. Now it\u2019s just my sister and I who help because everyone else has either moved to another city or have kids of their own to look after. \n\nI also have a fianc\u00e9 Sarah (28F). Sarah got into a car accident a few weeks ago and I took a break from work to stay home and take care of her. Sylvia heard I\u2019m taking time off work and asked if I could take the kids full time for one week while she focuses on some exams she\u2019s taking. I said I\u2019m sorry I wish I could, but I have my hands full with my fianc\u00e9. Sarah can\u2019t do much for herself at the moment and is in constant pain. It\u2019s also a lot for me to bare seeing her like this and I don\u2019t have the mental or emotional capacity to take care of anyone else. \n\nSylvia asked if Sarah is the one who told me to say no and I said no, I\u2019m the one saying no because I genuinely can\u2019t. Sylvia said 2 four year olds aren\u2019t much work and they\u2019re quiet kids so they won\u2019t be too much to deal with. I said I know her kids, and while they\u2019re not super disruptive, it\u2019ll still be too much for me to handle. I took time off work to take care of Sarah, not to take care of her kids too. I said sorry again and asked her to ask around for someone else to help.\n\nShe said fine and ended that conversation. A few days after the initial conversation, she FaceTimed me to say she realised I don\u2019t prioritise family because I\u2019m picking my fianc\u00e9 over her and she won\u2019t be bringing the kids to me anymore. I laughed at the absurdity and told her to stop acting like me babysitting her kids is a privilege for me. I do it because I love and care for her and want to do her a favour. Babysitting is a favour for her, not a favour for me. She said I\u2019ve taken it too far now and hung up the call. \n\nI completely forgot about her and the conversation because Sarah was doing a bit worse and we had to go back to the hospital, but Sylvia sent me a message saying she can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t even reached out to her since. I haven\u2019t responded and don\u2019t plan on it.\n\nWas I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1684438248, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13l8f6l/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_its_not_a_privilege_to/", "score": 5382, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sorry to hear about your fianc\u00e9, I hope you\u2019re both recovering from that experience of the car crash. Good on you for prioritising your spouse, and your mental health. \n\nIs there such a thing as twin 4 year olds that aren\u2019t work? Like be realistic, you\u2019re a full time carer for your partner right now, the last thing you need is two more people to take care of. What would your cousin do with her kids if you weren\u2019t on leave? Send them to childcare? \n\nYour cousin sounds like she really relies on family a lot. She\u2019s lucky, but has unrealistic expectations.", "NTA why is it that 2 four year olds is a higher priority over a recovering adult? It just doesn't make sense.

Wow, she tells you she's going no contact and then gets mad because you don't beg forgiveness?    \n\n\nActually, you had me at \"2 4-year-olds aren't that much trouble.\"  OMFG.  Has this woman EVER actually participated in raising her own children?", "op please never babysit for this woman again, let her actually see how much of a favor you were doing for HER.

She's the AH, not you\n..", "NTA\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e was in an accident bad enough to need to be in the hospital.

When she was having a hard time, you stepped up and helped her. Now, you're having a hard time, and she's making sure to kick you repeatedly. Remember that this is who she is. Don't waste another second on her.\n\nAnd tell your sister what is going on and your stance. Don't bend on it. Any family who gets upset are offering their babysitting services!

It should be a breeze to watch them while studying.", "PREACH!", "Right?\nShe just said they\u2019re no trouble so she should be fine to study.\n\nOmg Sylvia sounds like an entitled nightmare.\n\nWho the hell heard a family member is taking time off work to *take care of their fianc\u00e9e who was in a horrible accident* and takes that as \u2018oh cool free childcare\u2019?!\n\nI cannot imagine the level of selfishness to even think this.\n\nAlso saying you don\u2019t prioritize family? Uh\u2026she does get that fianc\u00e9e means you\u2019re marrying them\u2026right?

You did not take time off to cater to her and deal with her kids.\n\nFor once someone in the family (because surprise! Fianc\u00e9e is basically family) needs your help and focus. She needs to get over herself and realize that she is not the center of everyone\u2019s world. \n\nI feel for her being left pregnant with twins but not everything is gonna be about her. I understand why you guys all rallied around her but thinking it may have went on a bit too long. She\u2019s now went from seeing it as a helping hand offered to something she is just owed.\n\nId honestly end up blocking her for the week otherwise she\u2019s gonna hound you relentlessly. \nYou need to focus on your fianc\u00e9e and neither of you need two 4 year olds underfoot. \nGood luck op", "She can tell that to her boss when she takes them to work.", "Ding ding ding!!! My sentiments exactly. I can\u2019t stand entitled people, they are the worse\u2026 she needs to apologize to op and make up with him before she lose a good thing.

If two 4 year olds are so easy, their MOTHER should be able to take care of them herself. \n\nAnd as someone who has worked in daycares and education for years, caring for two 4 year olds is NOT easy.
