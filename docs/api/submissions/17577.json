Sylvia has twin girls who are 4 years old now. When she got pregnant, her boyfriend broke up with her and moved to another county. She was really heartbroken and had post natal depression so the entire family took turns taking care of her babies for the first year or so. Now it\u2019s just my sister and I who help because everyone else has either moved to another city or have kids of their own to look after. \n\nI also have a fianc\u00e9 Sarah (28F). Sarah got into a car accident a few weeks ago and I took a break from work to stay home and take care of her. Sylvia heard I\u2019m taking time off work and asked if I could take the kids full time for one week while she focuses on some exams she\u2019s taking. I said I\u2019m sorry I wish I could, but I have my hands full with my fianc\u00e9. Sarah can\u2019t do much for herself at the moment and is in constant pain. It\u2019s also a lot for me to bare seeing her like this and I don\u2019t have the mental or emotional capacity to take care of anyone else. \n\nSylvia asked if Sarah is the one who told me to say no and I said no, I\u2019m the one saying no because I genuinely can\u2019t. Sylvia said 2 four year olds aren\u2019t much work and they\u2019re quiet kids so they won\u2019t be too much to deal with. I said I know her kids, and while they\u2019re not super disruptive, it\u2019ll still be too much for me to handle. I took time off work to take care of Sarah, not to take care of her kids too. I said sorry again and asked her to ask around for someone else to help.\n\nShe said fine and ended that conversation. A few days after the initial conversation, she FaceTimed me to say she realised I don\u2019t prioritise family because I\u2019m picking my fianc\u00e9 over her and she won\u2019t be bringing the kids to me anymore. I laughed at the absurdity and told her to stop acting like me babysitting her kids is a privilege for me. I do it because I love and care for her and want to do her a favour. Babysitting is a favour for her, not a favour for me. She said I\u2019ve taken it too far now and hung up the call. \n\nI completely forgot about her and the conversation because Sarah was doing a bit worse and we had to go back to the hospital, but Sylvia sent me a message saying she can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t even reached out to her since. I haven\u2019t responded and don\u2019t plan on it.\n\nWas I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1684438248, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13l8f6l/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_its_not_a_privilege_to/", "score": 1184, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But as long as you get everyone in line and the rest of the family actually understand what it is she\u2019s demanding of you in true entitled spoiled baby manner, you should be ok.", "My husband has surgery this last summer and had horrific pain after due to complications. Sleeping became basically impossible for both of us for weeks and it was a living hell. I wish you and your fiance restful, healing sleep and a good pain management doctor.", "it sounds like your cousin is used to having the world revolve around her and her problems for the past 4 years and isn't ready to give that up", "If this is how Sylvia acts *now*, can't imagine why her ex moved countries to escape..\ud83d\ude44", ">I can see cousin attempting to just leave them at your house.\n\nHonestly if she does that, CPS should be called. Not even as a vindictive thing, but because dropping your kids of with someone who has repeatedly told you they cannot and will not take care of them is massively irresponsible as a parent.", "4 year olds are considered preschoolers, not toddlers.", "Oh wow, I misread. \ud83d\ude02 Yup, that\u2019s worse.", "Absolutely!

Great example of (literally) fuck around and find out", "I was thinking the same thing.", "If it was just HER, I\u2019d agree but the dude also flaked on the kids he helped create.

Birth control does fail. Just because it works for me and my body doesn't mean it does for everyone. \n\nI do agree she feels far too entitled to her family's time and energy based on the consequences of her decisions though."]}
