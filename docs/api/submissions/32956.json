If I were you I would definitely be seeing this dentist again (if they are good and you actually like them) and just ask for a different hygienist. \n\nFuck her honesty. Instead of being mad at you, she should be doing her job better. This is not a job to be fucking around like this. She can get someone sick and bare minimum, gross out a patient and make the practice look bad.", "NTA. \nThat\u2019s a huge violation of health and safety and she deserved to be reprimanded! \nImagine if someone got really sick from her lack of hygiene. \nIf she values her job then she will start doing it properly. \nAlso it\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s business which dentist you go to.", "NTA I guess the other complaint wasn't unreasonable as well she just wanted to play the victim", "NTA, your fried is the problem, it's basic hygiene rules. They don't want to follow rules, they have to to face the consequences.", "NTA she thought she could get away with it because you\u2019re her friend. It doesn\u2019t matter who it is if it goes on the floor it\u2019s not clean", "NTA-She deliberately chose not to follow protocol. You didn\u2019t force her to break the rules.

I would have done the same.", "NTA \"clean new gloves that were wrinkled out of her scrubs pocket\"  WTF did I just read?  Sure let's touch this bleeding wound with gloves covered in pocket lint.  FFS people.  Your friend shouldn't be anywhere near healthcare.", "NTA. Not following health sanitation protocol can get someone hurt or sick. There is a reason you have these protocols in the first place. Your friend should know this and should be ashamed", "NTA - you go see any dentist you want. Its not on you if she isn't following proper protocol. \n\nEven single moms with kids wh ohave issues still have to do their job correctly.", "NTA - Who knows how often she's done this when people haven't noticed. As a health professional, she should know better than that.", "NAH\n\nBut your friend should follow protocol and be prepared to be reprimanded for not following it.\n\nYou didn't pose the question, but this is why I avoid mixing friendships and business. It's all great until either party feels \"forced\" to assume strictly business roles. Most people can not completely separate both roles rationally, I certainly can't and decided a while ago not to risk friendships I cherish over it.", "ESH, your friend doesn't seem to be the most professional person, but what exactly did you expect would happen? You knew she was reprimanded already for something similar so this is obvious she would get in trouble.", "Both of y'all are assholes\n\nI'm not stitching on my friend for a dirty bib you handle that with her in private \n\nThe friend works in a healthcare field, she needs to fix that shit", "NAH, but she's right, you need to find a new dentist.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her not following established protocols got herself in trouble. AGAIN. She;s been warned about this before and she;s still doing it? 100% on her", "Your friend got herself in trouble. What did she want you to do? Get an infection just to protect her blatant violation of patient safety. She went to school for this, she knows what she is doing is wrong. She just doesn't care. If her personal life has gotten to the point she can't do her job that means she needs a different job. It is not on her employer or her patients to compensate for her personal issues. NTA", "NTA.  She's supposed to observing health and safety rules.  A bib off the floor isn't sanitary.  Gloves coming out of her pocket aren't clean.  This all reflects on the doctor.  Her home situation doesn't excuse this in any way.  Sure she's furious. Nobody wants to be reprimanded.  Again, isn't relevant.  She needs to be reprimanded and if she doesn't get it, probably fired.  But that's all on her, not you.", "NTA, isn\u2019t keeping everything sterile like a huge part of being in the health industry? It seems like you\u2019re not the only person she\u2019s been relaxed with this around. And because it\u2019s a pattern with her, she got reprimanded. She has no one to blame but herself.", "NTA. She chose to not follow protocol even after being reprimanded for a similar violation before. That she did it to a friend is irrelevant. She violated health sanitation procedures repeatedly and her employers are handling those violations like they should. The easy solution to this situation is for her to choose to stop committing violations\n\nETA: you didn't get her in trouble, she got herself in trouble", "NTA your friend being bad at her job is a *her* problem", "Her personal issues have no bearing on whether she should be forgiven for significant safety lapses.\n\nIndeed, if she cites personal reasons as a contributing factor for significant safety lapses, that becomes a reason to fire her, not forgive her.\n\nWhatever your personal issues, if you're any kind of professional where distraction can compromise safety, you need to leave those issues behind on the job.", "I've switched dental offices for this very reason. So much ignorant cross contamination.", "There has been disease transmission related to poor practices in dental offices.  The rules and regulations are there to keep patients and providers safe.    \n\n\nSome people are not suited to healthcare professions.  This friend sounds like one.", "so according to your thoughts the fact that she's her friend means she shouldnt care about possibly getting a nasty infection or blood poisoning? Really?"]}
