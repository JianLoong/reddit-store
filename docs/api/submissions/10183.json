So we are quiet familiar with diseases. \nMy husband is hypochondriac. He always \u201edoes not feel well\u201c and runs to the doctors all the time who tells him: everything is fine (obviously when there is something going on they tell him otherwise. But this is not often the case). \n\nWhen Corona hit everything went downhill pretty bad. He had to work on ICU to care for infected people (i did not as i was pregnant) and always \u201ehad corona\u201c. He tested himself twice a day because he was so worried. (For himself - not me so much as he said he is protected very well and showers before coming home - which was cute by the way) And did not go outside besides for work. \n(Spoiler: non of us ever had corona. We know for sure as he tested himself so much and never actually had symptoms or anything). \nAnyway: when Corona got better he did not. Always when i got somekind of sick (stomach sick, throat sore or anything like that) he got it too. But not the normal: he gets is two days after me but a couple weeks after me. Or he had it the second i had and he was like dead sick. For example i had a fever and felt horrible. (Spoiler is was a mastitis) I had to take care for our baby. And take care for him\u2026 found out pretty soon that he had no fever (when i used the thermometer the last temperature is always shown). I told him to grow up and that he had a problem. He should go to therapy with it. \n\nNow i gave birth to our second. And as every women knows giving birth and the time after is not the best. Despite the sleep deprive and everything i got my period again. And it hit me like really bad. I never had such bad cramps. My husband asked what is wrong and i told him i have cramps (not that i am on my period again). Besides this i had a infection of the bladder and needed antibiotics. \nHe then said a couple hours later: hey i think our food wasn\u2019t good. And i asked why? He said well he now has bad cramps too! And also he thinks he has an infection of the bladder and wanted to get those sticks to test himself. \n\nI got furious. I told him i cannot even have my period for myself now. That he is not sick. The food was fine. I am just bleeding again and really need a break. He is a doctor and knows symptoms and how to deal with them and if he cannot do it by himself he does not need those sticks but therapy. \n\nHe got mad and said he really felt unwell and i be unfair. \n\nI told him that, when he is always \u201esick\u201c i cannot tell apart when he is really unwell and when not and i sometimes need his attention as well when i feel really unwell. And i gladly help him when he is really sick. He needs to go to therapy. \n\nNow he is not speaking to me and closed himself in the bedroom. \n\nThere are more examples. \n\nSo AITA for telling him that he needs to go to therapy because he cannot have every disease i have.

Has he ever had full bloodwork done to check out why he is \"ill\" all the time? Has he discussed being ill all the time with his GP? \n\nThere is a small chance that he is really sick but truly, since he copies your symptoms, it seems like its more a psychological problem. I think going to your GP together and expressing your concerns about his health (if you haven't done so already) might be a good idea. Maybe his GP can convince him to try out therapy.", "I think NTA, because your husband seems to be crying wolf, and that is really dangerous. And you have tried to explain that to him - that doctors are going to stop taking him seriously.\n\nMy grandmother was a terrible hypochondriac. It went on for years and years. It absolutely exhausted my mother. Always something wrong, never any evidence. The doctor actually gave her a stern talking to about all the times she called for an emergency visit with nothing wrong. She was caught faking a fall more than once after that. \n\nSo when she actually fell, alone, then got up and went back to her chair before calling for help, no-one really took her seriously because she could walk, and limps can be faked. \n\nTurned out this time she did fall, and she broke her hip. Took days to discover because everyone told her to just take some paracetamol for her \"sore hip\" and she'd be fine.\n\nI do think, OP, that your husband has a mental health issue here. I think he really believes he is ill, and that is something to worry about. He really needs to go to therapy to get to the bottom of this, before a genuine illness is ignored by doctors who are fed up with him.", "Husbands likely got some anxiety disorder along with OCD.

Has he seen a therapist about this? It sounds too intense to be just hypochondria. Maybe Manchausens?", "NTA it sound\u2019s completely draining to have to mentally support him through all of this, especially when you need some support yourself. You\u2019re only human so I\u2019m not surprised you snapped. Especially  because like you say if he was properly ill you might not believe it. I hope he can get some help as it sounds exhausting for both of you.", "NAH \n\nI suffered from SEVERE health anxiety for almost two yeas when corona hit and honestly it was out of control. I would often act the same way your husband is acting right now. He is not being malicious, but I get how frustrating it must be for you. I really do. Only therapy helped me", "Yes. It actually is. He never grew out of it i guess \ud83d\ude05", "You'd be surprised by how many germophobes work in ICU. I know I was.", "Thank you! \n\nYeah i always tell myself he feels this way because i think he really has a problem (even i think by now it is a mental problem, not a body one) I went to so many doctors with him to find anything out. MRT.  CT. Allergy Testing. He had a gastroscopy and a colonoscopy, dentist, just to name a few. \n\nBut when you feel really really sick and the other one is just taking it for himself you snap. I feel really bad right now because of it. But otherwise: it was about my period \ud83d\ude05", "Okay. Thanks. Yeah we got some problems at the moment. It was alot going on. Corona. Two babies.  I am not doing him right all the time as well. Either way he is a very good guy that loves me and my children alot. We are both on thin nerves right now and we both need some time to overthink certain stuff. Sometimes we just need help to put stuff in the right context to get a healthier relationship.

Like come on, she\u2019s right. She can\u2019t even have her period to herself without this man cosplaying her symptoms.", "Yeah. BUT: my Husband is private patient (we live in Germany) and everything is paid by insurance. Not matter what. He had a mrt. A ctg. A colonoscopy. A gastroscopy. We tested for allergies.

As he likes him alot and trusts him! \n\nYeah we have done alot the last year (mrt, ct, bloodwork, allergy testing. colonoscopy gastroscopy and so on\u2026) \n\nHe had a light anemia which is treated now and normal after we tested again. No allergies. His colon and stomach are fine. His brain is good. He actually has high pressure in the eye and takes eye drops now.

Living in Germany. It is alot better here then a year ago!", " Why did you write: \"my children\" and not \" our children\"?", "No, you're not understanding what I've said.  Regardless of all the procedures he's had, that doesn't mean he doesn't have a chronic illness.  You can read other people's accounts all over the place about how they tried for years/decades to find out what was wrong with them and came up empty until it progressed to the point where it couldn't be waved off any more.  If he says he doesn't feel good, then believe him.  You're his wife.  Yes, period cramps are horrific.  I'm not down playing what you're going through.  But that doesn't mean he isn't having issues as well.  I might change my vote to YTA. You seem like you don't care about him because your pain is a lot. Both can be true.", "That's totally fair and I understand. Trust me, I know how you feel. The only way I ever found to effectively deal with it was to maliciously comply. One time I left work in the middle of the day because my then-husband was texting me ridiculous things. I went home to make sure he was okay, which he was. Then I told him that I'd call an ambulance next time because I take what he says seriously. \"If you mean it, you need serious medical care. If you don't mean it, knock it off.\"", "I understand where this is coming from. I do believe him. And i try to support him as much as i can if he feels unwell. I try to take it serious. But also i try to help him with therapy. Because he may be chronically ill. But maybe he has a mental problem as well. And if he can go to any doctor to get help , he can also go to therapy. They will help him no matter what. Even if he is chronically ill a therapy can help to deal with it otherwise. \n\nEither way what is happening it is not healthy. Why treat the body but not the mind? \n\nI probably are not fair to him when i feel exhausted myself. And did i overreact this time? Yes. \n\nIt is just hard for both parts to go from doctor to doctor and to get told: everything is alright. I want to believe my husband. In moments where you feel like shit yourself it is just not always easy. \n\nAnd when every headache is a brain tumor\u2026 \nThe thing is: if you run to the doctors for every headache because you think it is a brain tumor and you get an mrt the doctor might not take you serious if you really have a tumor\u2026 it is just a huge big bad circle in which i want to support him to decide if this is reality OR just a thought and fear in his head. It is a huge difference and i want him to try to see the difference to help him better. \n\nIf he feels unwell this is fine and i gladly help him with everything i have. But there is a point on which i cannot decide anymore which i have to take serious and what not (unwell or braintumor)", "YTA you had 2 kids with guy.    \n\nDid he does this with children as well ?\n\nDo they tip toe around him because daddy is sick ?  \n\nYou are setting a terrible example for your children by enabling him.", "NTA. He needs some help. This is not normal. Just wait until the kids catch something lol.", "ESH. Why did you marry a hypochondriac? Either you believe he struggles with this, but it sounds like you don\u2019t, or you think he\u2019s dramatic and competitive, and it (understandably) pisses you off. Did you expect him to change when you had the baby?", "He really needs therapy. This is a serious problem. Also  he is acting like a child because he closed himself in the bedroom.\n\nProfessional treatments for hypochondria include:\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which is very helpful for reducing patient fears. In this type of therapy, the person learns to recognize and understand the false beliefs that set off their anxiety.\u00a0Research has shown\u00a0that CBT successfully teaches hypochondriacs to identify what triggers their behavior and gives them coping skills to help them manage it.\n\nBehavioral stress management or exposure therapy may be helpful\n\nPsychotropic medications, such as anti-depressants, are sometimes used to treat health anxiety disorder\n\nIt is worth noting that many sufferers are unwilling to acknowledge the role anxiety plays in their symptoms. This makes them less likely to seek help from a mental health professional. Often, hypochondriacs are so resistant to the idea that they have anxiety that it takes intervention from loved ones to help them understand that they need assistance.\n\nDoes your spouse accept that he has a problem. If yes then is he willing to go for therapy. If he is not willing then you figure things out on your own", "Lol nta he needs therapy if he tried claiming period cramps as food poisoning lol", "It sounds too intense to be just hypochondria.", "Yeah, her husband is definitely getting his period."]}
