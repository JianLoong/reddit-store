So if I were you, I would be on a lookout for weird behavior.", "NTA and good on you for standing up for yourself. Your bf's behaviour is deeply concerning. It's extremely possessive and suspicious. His trying to put a handprint on you is akin to branding you as his property. \n\nOP this is unlikely to get better. It sounds like it's part of a pattern - one that you don't need in your life and one that could do you harm in the future. \n\nIt's time to demonstrate to your boyfriend that you're your own person, a strong woman and deserve respect - by leaving him. \n\nInsert abusive single dude hand jokes here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When you said you didn't want the handprint, he should have removed his hand. \n\nWith that being said, I actually agree with him that it's weird that it was a big deal for you. It sounds like a funny inside joke for a couple. He keeps his hand on your ass and you have tan lines of his hand on your ass for a bit. That is the kind of fun and sexy stuff couples do. It's kinda like a sexy secret between you two because no one else will be seeing it. I'd ask about doing the same thing to him so there would be matching handprints. If my man didn't want to do it, I wouldn't get mad like your boyfriend did, but I would definitely have a serious conversation about it.", "NTA its dehumanising as hell to see your body as just purely something another man can enjoy rather than you, the human living in your body having a preference over not having an uneven tan. I had a boyfriend once who accused me of letting other men kiss me because i didn\u2019t want to buy a make up product that smelt bad, like it was completely irrelevant whether i want put a substance that smells on my own skin all day, the only thing that\u2019s important is other men being able to smell my skin lol. I dumped him. Like your boyfriend he sees you as a possession and gets angry when his possession doesnt do things his way, e.g giving you the silent treatment for not willingly accepting him branding you then telling you \u201cits tine to go\u201d. He doesnt see you as a human being with your own rights. Get out.", "NTA. It sounds like you're seeing things for what they are.

Your body, your choice.\n You don't even have to give a reason for what you want or don't want on your body. It is your body, it is your choice. \n\nIf he wanted to brand or tattoo a claim on you against your wishes, you wouldn't even be asking us this. You'd be saying NO end of discussion.  A tan line of his hand on you is no different because you said no.", "NTA!\n\nJesus your boyfriend is toxic AF. And the cheating allegations that came outta left field screams that he\u2019s projecting. My ex was the same way with projecting and he was the one who was cheating. I would back out of this relationship as soon as possible to save yourself from his toxic and childish behavior.", "NTA. By the way...he's probably the one cheating.", "NTA and actually sounds very toxic. He's trying to suggest some kind of ownership of your body and marking 'his territory'. In many cases of abuse, the abuser doing things like writing their name on the victims body or somehow asserting 'ownership' is common. This seems like a red flag, coupled with the rest of his behaviour, its a whole load of worry. You might want to reconsider whether you are with the right man.", "NTA. The most plausible reason you don't want his handprint branded on your body is because you are not his property. His behaviour sounds toxic, controlling and abusive. Leave.", "Not to mention the cherry on top of him telling her \u201cIt\u2019s time to go,\u201d when she\u2019s clearly not about to go anywhere. It\u2019s bossy, condescending and sounds like he wants to ruin her day out, because his is \u201cruined.\u201d \n\nHe\u2019s a walking red flag.", "Seconding this. NTA, OP, but I would reconsider the relationship - a partner should respect your boundaries and make you feel safe and supported. Please trust me, the infidelity accusations will rear their head again whenever you try to assert yourself or do something he doesn't like.\n\nI'd honestly dump his ass right now, because that red flag is visible from space.", "Correction with regards to the hand print. OP would see it and most likely would have altered some of her behavoiurs because of it. Like going to the beach which she clearly enjoys.\n\nIts highly possesive behaviour by OPs bf.", "This. Do you really want to stay with someone who doesn't respect your boundaries?", "There have been arguments before this where I\u2019ve brought up something and he leaves saying he\u2019s too upset to keep speaking on the issue.

When only one party, the one instigating this, sees it this way it is abuse.", "There's an old saying, Women marry a man hoping he'll change, men marry a woman hoping she wont.     \nHe will not change, not without counselling *and* the desire to change. If you stay with him this will be the rest of your life dealing with behavior like this.", "It's not abuse to find it funny and find it strange your partner has a problem with it. It is perfectly acceptable to initiate a conversation about it and explain that you think it's weird to have a problem with it. It would probably be a deal breaker for me just because it indicates a major compatibility issue *for me.* So I, of course, would want to discuss the issue at length. \n\nIt's only abusive if you force the issue and try to physically force your partner to comply or verbally berate your partner over it.", "NTA at all. Your body is your body and him trying to \"mark his territory\" is gross and massively disrespectful.", "NTA, you just finally reached your breaking point with your bf and his unreasonable behavior.

You don\u2019t deserve to be treated that way, he is immature.", "Dude wants to temporarily brand you with his handprint and gets mad at you when you don't want to do that? Please think about what exactly you're getting out of this relationship.", "NTA", "Wow! NTA\n\nhe IS toxic af.", "Nta. I would dump him. He seems very immature. Like he's getting his idea of how a relationship is supposed to be from tv shows and thinks conflict is normal. He started a fight for no reason. The way stuff like that turns out is eventually you will feel like you are walking on eggshells around him not sure what's going to set it off. Just break up and move on", "This relationship is *not* it.  I\u2019d 100% breakup with him if I were you.\n\nNTA", "Nta I had a boyfriend like this at your age. I'm not normally one to say this but I'd reconcider the relationship if I were you. He doesn't respect your bodily automomy. Not having a hand print on your bum is a reasonable request. He ignores your boundaries and he accuses you of things you didn't do. Even if it's not an everyday thing it isn't OK.", "I hate to break it to you, but he\u2019s projecting on you because HE\u2019S cheating\u2026 NTA, but you would be to yourself if you put up with him.", "NTA\nYour boyfriend is being ridiculous, and his insistence on having his handprint on your backside is troubling.", "NTA leave his ass wow", "NTA.

He is a controlling AH and this is only going to get worse.", "And if he\u2019ll refuse on a public beach, what\u2019s he gonna do in private if she\u2019s not in the mood one night? His attitude is really alarming\u2026", "I see. I find it interesting you think the handprint being visible on your ass would be trashy but you don't think your ass cheeks hanging out is trashy.  I would think someone finding one to be trashy would find the other to be trashy. And also the other way around. I would expect someone who *doesn't* find displaying a handprint on their ass as being trashy would also not think wearing a swimsuit with their ass cheeks hanging out as\n trashy. Either way, I just assumed your ass cheeks would be covered by your swimsuit. My mistake.", "What? OP over here has a right to wear whatever swimsuit pleases her, just as you do. As long as her privates are covered properly, a bit of cheeksp showing shouldn't be a problem.", "He didn\u2019t take his hand off her when she told him too. He then accused her of cheating bc that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t want his handprint in her ass. OP states he consistently tries to make her feel badly in situations where she does nothing wrong. All sounds like emotional abuse to me.", "Yeah, I said NTA because the boyfriend was acting like an ass. And I said he should have removed his hand."]}
