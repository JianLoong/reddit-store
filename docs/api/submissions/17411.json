A few times she has also blown up and said some terrible things - \"I don't know what my son sees in you\" and \"I wish you had never met\" for example. These incidents have really hurt my wife and at this point she doesn't want to be around my mother anymore, and I don't blame her.\n\nMy family is one where people (especially mom!) will blow up and say terrible things \"they don't mean,\" and later apologize and expect to move on as if it didn't happen.

Your mother is so bloody rude, and it's good you stood up to her. Stick to your guns. If your mother can't be nice to your wife, then that's her problem.", "Actually, it is now about the mother of your children. You did good. Maybe you should have sent a card, but she sounds like quite a piece of work and you were making a specific point about her behavior. Unfortunately it's unlikely to take, but you've tried. NTA", "NTA.  Your wife is lucky to have you!  And hopefully your mom eventually learns that she can't be a little shit to your partner and still get to be in your life.", "NTA, while you have taken baby steps into recognizing that your family dynamics are not normal, and started taking steps to create boundaries, they only work if the other person, your mother, actually knows about them. Otherwise you are still rug sweeping and not really confronting and dealing with the issue in a healthy way. You made the decision to spend mothers day with your wife and children, yet your mother will blame your wife, because you did not tell her it was your choice due to her treatment of your wife. You need to talk to your mother and set some firm boundaries about how things are going to go from here forward and what consequences will happen if she crosses those boundaries.", "NTA why did it take you so long?", "NTA, good on you for stepping up for your wife. Happy mother's day to her!", "NTA. Mothers are supposed to love their kids and support them, not verbally abuse their kid's significant other for no reason other than she just doesn't like them. If she can't do that, then she doesn't get awarded celebration for being your mother.\n\nAlso, you spent Mother's Day with the mother of your children. You spent a day setting an example for your children of how to act towards their mother and you showed your wife that you support her and her emotional well-being. \n\nThat's being a good father and a good husband. If your mother wants you to be a \"better son\" she needs to be a better mother and not bash the mother of her grandkids.", "Good for you, you finally grew a set.", "NTA, marriage always comes first. You made the right choice. \n\nBut not really sure how you expected your mom to react when you ghosted her on Mother\u2019s Day and she seems to have an inferiority complex around your wife.", "NTA! Your wife deserves to be put first especially when your mom is the cause of the conflict, and your mom got what her actions has cause. \n\nI would have explained to her why, though. Especially if you're not ready to go no contact with her. Tell her that if she keep attacking your wife, you're going to see her less. That is it her actions which causer your reactions. That way she can't play the victim card, and you don't have to be unsure every time.\n\nGood on you for standing up to your wife! No one deserves to have to be forced to meet people that are actively trying to get then down every way they can. Your wife can't protect herself from your mom, that's your responsibility. So it's very good that you're taking it. Just be clearer with your mom. Yes she's going to argue when you first tell her, but same as with a toddler she is going to have to face the consequences if she continues.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is gaslighting/manipulating you by trying to pit you against your wife. It is really toxic. You are setting boundaries that are necessary for the sake of your relationship and your own family that you are creating with your wife.", "NTA. Your wife is the mother of your children, and your chosen partner (and who chose to be with you). She is the most important person in your life. Work hard to maintain this good relationship.\n\nYour mom has boxed herself in, separating herself from polite society. You didn't forget her, you avoided her toxicity. Keep doing so and your life will be way better.", "NTA. It\u2019s really sad that you feel the need to ask this question. By mistreating your wife all these years, your mother is also disrespecting you and your life choices. She is actively hurting your family. Why should she get a Happy Mother\u2019s Day? That would be enabling the behavior.", "NTA. More people need to do this. You helped your children to celebrate their mother, not a narcissist who demands attention.", "NTA. She got less than what she deserves, IMO.", "NTA. You are correct to support your wife and make the day about her. I'm sorry that your mother has made it a situation where you have to choose sides. \n\nFor myself, when dealing with people I don't really want to deal with (even relatives), I try to remain as polite and positive as possible, even if distant, so I would have sent a card, maybe flowers or a gift, too. Sure, she would still be upset that you didn't visit or call, but you didn't forget her.", "NTA if your mam wants respect then she needs to start earning it back. She is no longer your no 1 priority your wife is the way it should be. I'd tell your mam that until she shifts her attitude for good that your wife will remain your only focus.", "NTA. Your mother needs to be civil to your wife.", "NTA\n\nThis is going to be a hard pill for your mother to swallow, but you have taken a step in the right direction by not rewarding her horrendous behaviour with gifts and attention on Mother's Day.\n\nYou now need to show your wife you intend to keep having her back by staying low-contact with your mother until she can find it within her to at least be civil.", "NTA you finally found your balls and put your family (wife and kids first)!! I bet your mom blamed your wife, huh? Get ready because thinks won\u2019t get easier with your mom so be ready to grow an even bigger pair of balls and stand by your wife!", "Go NC with her. NTA", ">Earlier this year my mom made a rude comment about my wife and I decided I was done taking it.\n\nINFO: And you sat down with her and had a mature discussion about this? And about what your relationship with her would look like going forward?  \n\nOr you just thought \"I'll totally ignore her on Mother's Day,\" that'll show her?", "NTA yeah it's a bit petty but why not actually tell her you didn't forget? Her behaviour has meant that for you there hasn't been anything to celebrate. \n\nMaybe if she respected your family there would be but now she has made herself an outsider, why should your wife either not celebrate mother's day at all or be forced to spend it with someone who is cruel to her?", "ESH. Your mother for obvious reasons.\n\nYou're NTA for choosing you wife over your mother, that was appropriate. YTA for not telling your mom what you were doing. If you want to go NC go NC. If you want to show her that she can't say these things and expect to have no consequences then you have to tie the act into the consequence. Now she gets to play the victim.", "Sort of YTA. When you ignored your mother you went low like she does. Two wrongs don't make a right. You should have sent flowers and a card. Your wife is now your primary relationship and is the MOTHER to your children. What the hell are you doing allowing your mother to make those comments to your wife?

I don't know how grown you are but boy if you don't cut off your family.. your wife is your number one now.

But I realize now that this isn't normal or okay.\n\nOP is NTA in this situation, towards his mother. His mother is a huge AH. \n\nIDK how to word this next part, because I think OP is on the right track now, I\u2019m sure he was trying to keep the peace before, and good on him for finally coming to his senses. But ultimately he was TA for not doing more to protect and prioritize his wife from his mother\u2019s abuse much sooner. I mean that from a very understanding perspective - I\u2019m not trying to say he\u2019s an awful person. I think his intentions are good. But being an AH isn\u2019t just about intent, it\u2019s also about impact. His wife took the brunt of her MIL\u2019s BS for 5 years of marriage (and longer than that, before you were married), and just looking at the examples he gave, it was pretty bad, and that\u2019s really unfortunate. \n\nIn the face of a family member who is abusive to your spouse, it\u2019s your responsibility to set boundaries with your family, and enforce consequences when those boundaries are violated. Any half measures come at the expense of your spouse\u2019s wellbeing.\n\nI get it, it\u2019s hard to really appreciate how messed up family dynamics are when you grew up with them, but it\u2019s unfortunate it\u2019s taken over 5 years. \n\nOP, please do everything you can to make this up to your wife, including maintaining rigid boundaries with your mother and allowing zero tolerance for her bad behavior. Being at risk of being cut off from grandchildren can be mighty inspiring for crappy MILs to get their sh*t together.\n\nNo more of your mother being alone with your wife, ever. The second your mother is rude, your family leaves (or if you\u2019re at your house, she is asked to leave your home). She blows up? \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way, we can talk when you\u2019re feeling calm again, I\u2019m hanging up the phone.\u201d Mother\u2019s Day is for the mother of your children - mom gets a call or a card, and a visit on another day.

You\u2019re on the right track now - stay the course and do what you can to make it up to your wife for the many years she\u2019s had to deal with your mother.", "Exactly.
