{"id": 19681, "submission_id": "149c5u0", "title": "AITA For Insisting my Husband Sleep in the Nursery Once a Week", "selftext": "Back story: I am a SAHM and my husband works four 10 hours shifts a week, waking at 4:30am. Our 7 month son still drinks one 2am bottle. I do this 6 nights a week, but want one night off on one of my husband's 3 weekend nights, so that I can get one uninterrupted deep night of sleep a week. Additionally, I want him to sleep in the nursery with my son for that one night, where we also have a nice twin bed. He wants to stay in our master for all 7 nights a week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy reasoning: I am a much lighter sleeper than my husband and always wake up to even small movements and sounds on the monitor. My husband sleeps through a lot/most. For instance, in the past he has claimed our son slept til 9am, when in reality he slept until 7am and then made lots of loud playful noises in his crib and my husband never woke up to them. I've had nights up with my son crying multiple times and he thought the baby slept through the night. Even if my husband does the 2am feed, if he stays in the master, I still will be the one who wakes up frequently on my \"night off\" since the monitor would still be in the room with us. I'd likely have to wake him when our son wants to be fed. My point of view is I would still carry the mental load of that night too since Id still be listening to/hearing the monitor and thus wouldn't actually get better sleep. I feel I deserve one night a week where I can truly sleep deeply with no monitor and no listening for the baby, and be able to trust that my husband has the situation fully handled as he is in the room with him. I also don't feel comfortable just having no monitor at this age as our son is at the mobile age where he gets himself into trouble such as arms/legs caught in his crib but can't get himself out of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband's reasoning is he is happy to do baby duties but wants to do so from his bed instead of the nursery and feels it is an unreasonable ask to be asked to sleep in the nursery once a week. He thinks if I wake up to the baby on his night, that isn't his problem. He thinks I am overly paranoid and that if I have trouble sleeping with the monitor, we should just turn off the monitor. The nursery is 10 yards down the hall from the master and we (read:me) likely would still hear him without monitor if he cried loudly, but wouldn't be able to hear quieter noises without a monitor. My husband thinks that me waking frequently to the baby is an anxiety problem and that I should basically work on myself at being less anxious by stop using crutches like the monitor or him sleeping in the nursery. He feels that by sleeping in the nursery he is enabling anxiety/paranoid behavior\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdditional relevant info:\n\n\\- Our baby can't sleep in the master with us, due to lack of space.\n\n\\- I don't want this arrangement forever. Either until he drops that feed or turns one, whichever comes first\n\n\\- My husband knows that I am posting and helped edit his side. We will go with what the internet decrees.\n\nEdit to add: We have already been doing it this way for the past month and my husband wants to discontinue doing it this way. I do feel that I get much better sleep this way and am able to sleep through. I usually have to ask my husband the next morning if he fed the baby, because I didn't hear anything and slept through.", "created_utc": 1686759843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149c5u0/aita_for_insisting_my_husband_sleep_in_the/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Considering he sleeps through the baby monitor alarm and apparently even the baby's voice?", "NTA - If the nursery has a nice bed he will can handle sleeping there for one night a week. Especially as you care for baby six nights a week. You don't have anxiety issues, just motherly instincts and light sleep. Your husband is selfish.", "NTA one night a week of uninterrupted sleep should be the priority. I really don't see why your husband has a problem sleeping in the nursery one night to allow this.", "NTA.  He doesn't get to sleep through the hard parts of fatherhood.", "NTA. Sounds like he can't actually do his night of caring for the baby unless he is right there with the baby. He might not like it but it's fair, it's one night.\n\nAnd you waking to the sounds the baby makes are most certainly not an anxiety or paranoia problem; it's a simple biology and evolution thing. We are tuned to respond to the sounds of our babies. I saw a program that talked about how becoming a parent /the primary caregiver to a newborn literally makes changes in our brains that help us to be able to respond to their needs. Usually it is the mother that has this happen because usually the mother is most involved in newborn care. They used to think this was a \"female\" brain thing but have since discovered that it is an \"anybody\" brain thing, it happens to dads or other people that are the main newborn carer too. In your family obviously this is you, and he doesn't respond as well because his brain didn't adapt for that because he didn't need to - that's not a bad thing or criticism of him, it's just the role he has is the external working provider instead of the hands on care provider. It does mean, though, that he will have to make a bit of extra effort to make himself be the one who is ready to respond on his night so that you don't have to.\n\nRemind him as well that it's only likely to be a few months of this. Babies move through stages rapidly and learn to sleep through the night before they are one usually. He won't have to do it for too long but the difference it will make to your wellbeing in the meantime is huge. Quality rest truly is gold.", "NTA. Sleep is critical and getting you one uninterrupted night per week should be a high priority for both of you. There is a bed in there, it's not like you're asking him to sleep on the floor. \n\nHis idea of just shutting off the monitor is not developmentally appropriate for a 7 month old. You need to be able to hear sounds of distress.", "NTA. One night sleeping in a slightly less than ideal bed so your exhausted wife can get some sleep is an extremely reasonable thing to do. He is being selfish.", "NTA. He needs to do his fair share. Source-a sleep-deprived mom who can't get her husband to do even one night a week but wishes he would.", "Nta.   I can't even get started on the fact that your husband thinks that you are too anxious or paranoid, and that a monitor is a crutch, ect.  \n\nSir, you need to look up and read what happens to the brain of the main caregiver of a baby.  There is no excuse for this type of ignorance.", "> He thinks if I wake up to the baby on his night, that isn\u2019t his problem.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t your husband care about your well-being? He\u2019s TA, not you.", "NTA. Why don't you do a 4-week trial of this plan and then have a discussion about it again? See if you actually do get a better night's sleep. See if your husband does wake up and tend to him without being prodded by you. You're not anxious or paranoid. You have totally normal first-time mom attentiveness. A monitor is still important at this age.", "if the husband is reading this: YOU SUCK. let your wife have one night of decent sleep a week. this is pretty much the bare minimum a partner should be doing and you can\u2019t even do that. how pathetic.\n\nto OP: NTA. you are not paranoid for wanting to make sure that your child is being taken care of throughout the night.", "NTA. I don't understand the enabling anxious/paranoid behavior reasoning. Just like him being a deep sleeper isnt something he can help, you being a light sleeper isnt something you can help.\n\nPutting the baby monitor stuff aside, just talking about it logistically, the problem you are trying to solve is you getting a full nights sleep uninterrupted. In order to do that, he has to wake up for the 2am feeding. He cannot wake up for it without an alarm. So, you two cannot be in the same room on that night (he needs the alarm, it wakes you).\n\nHe could stay in the master if you could go elsewhere to get a full night's sleep. Unless you have a different extra bed in the house somewhere besides the nursery, it seems this is the only way it works.", "NAH. It isn\u2019t his fault he\u2019s a deeper sleeper- this arrangement is a little odd and he isn\u2019t at fault for not wanting to sleep somewhere other than his bed. Butttt you\u2019re not wrong to ask when it\u2019s waking you up.", "if it were me, I would make him do it all 3 nights he has off. Share the load.", "[deleted]", "ESH, You are not going to get a full night sleep either way, he will sleep through the small noises that you seem to hear whether he sleeps in the room with baby or not.

Asking your husband to help out more with the baby at night is totally reasonable.  Kicking him out of his bed is not.", "Yta", "Mild YTA. I am a light sleeper too and believe me I understand. But you being a light sleeper is a you problem not a him problem, kicking him out of his bed is not fair. Do you have a travel cot you could put into your room one night a week while you take the bed in the nursery?", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"He wants to stay in our master for all 7 nights a week.\" .. you are an AH in this. You do not get to kick your partner out of his bed. YOU can sleep somewhere else, though.", "Info: have you considered earplugs? Your hubs can turn up the monitor volume and make sure he wakes up from it while in the comfort of his own bed. You still get the uninterrupted sleep. I do agree with you that you continuing the mental load would be an AH perspective on hubs' part", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I do personally feel though that he is basically relying on me to wake up if something unusual did happen, he might disagree.", "NTA for wanting the night off but if the husband never hears the baby how do you trust he will wake up and not leave the baby screaming and hungry.", "So he sets his alarm to feed the baby and doesn\u2019t sleep through that. He basically preemptively wakes up and gets a bottle ready just before my son would generally start getting hungry. When he is in the nursery with the baby I completely sleep through the night feed he does, otherwise I\u2019m at minimum waking up to his alarm but most often more.\n\nMy husband does still sleep through smaller noises (like when my son is quietly happily awake in the morning, it\u2019s pretty common for me to wake up in the morning and the baby is awake in the crib but husband is sleeping) but he also wakes up to a lot more when they are actually in the same room. For example he would sleep through loud cooing in our bedroom but not in the nursery. I definitely think he would wake up to something going wrong, such as arms/legs in crib bars", "So we actually currently have this arrangement (which my husband wants to change) and I do in fact sleep through the night when he is in the nursery with the baby.
