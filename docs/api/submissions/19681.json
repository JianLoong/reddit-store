Our 7 month son still drinks one 2am bottle. I do this 6 nights a week, but want one night off on one of my husband's 3 weekend nights, so that I can get one uninterrupted deep night of sleep a week. Additionally, I want him to sleep in the nursery with my son for that one night, where we also have a nice twin bed. He wants to stay in our master for all 7 nights a week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy reasoning: I am a much lighter sleeper than my husband and always wake up to even small movements and sounds on the monitor. My husband sleeps through a lot/most. For instance, in the past he has claimed our son slept til 9am, when in reality he slept until 7am and then made lots of loud playful noises in his crib and my husband never woke up to them. I've had nights up with my son crying multiple times and he thought the baby slept through the night. Even if my husband does the 2am feed, if he stays in the master, I still will be the one who wakes up frequently on my \"night off\" since the monitor would still be in the room with us. I'd likely have to wake him when our son wants to be fed. My point of view is I would still carry the mental load of that night too since Id still be listening to/hearing the monitor and thus wouldn't actually get better sleep. I feel I deserve one night a week where I can truly sleep deeply with no monitor and no listening for the baby, and be able to trust that my husband has the situation fully handled as he is in the room with him. I also don't feel comfortable just having no monitor at this age as our son is at the mobile age where he gets himself into trouble such as arms/legs caught in his crib but can't get himself out of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband's reasoning is he is happy to do baby duties but wants to do so from his bed instead of the nursery and feels it is an unreasonable ask to be asked to sleep in the nursery once a week. He thinks if I wake up to the baby on his night, that isn't his problem. He thinks I am overly paranoid and that if I have trouble sleeping with the monitor, we should just turn off the monitor. The nursery is 10 yards down the hall from the master and we (read:me) likely would still hear him without monitor if he cried loudly, but wouldn't be able to hear quieter noises without a monitor. My husband thinks that me waking frequently to the baby is an anxiety problem and that I should basically work on myself at being less anxious by stop using crutches like the monitor or him sleeping in the nursery. He feels that by sleeping in the nursery he is enabling anxiety/paranoid behavior\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdditional relevant info:\n\n\\- Our baby can't sleep in the master with us, due to lack of space.\n\n\\- I don't want this arrangement forever. Either until he drops that feed or turns one, whichever comes first\n\n\\- My husband knows that I am posting and helped edit his side. We will go with what the internet decrees.\n\nEdit to add: We have already been doing it this way for the past month and my husband wants to discontinue doing it this way. I do feel that I get much better sleep this way and am able to sleep through. I usually have to ask my husband the next morning if he fed the baby, because I didn't hear anything and slept through.", "created_utc": 1686759843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149c5u0/aita_for_insisting_my_husband_sleep_in_the/", "score": 137, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Considering he sleeps through the baby monitor alarm and apparently even the baby's voice?", "NTA - If the nursery has a nice bed he will can handle sleeping there for one night a week. Especially as you care for baby six nights a week. You don't have anxiety issues, just motherly instincts and light sleep. Your husband is selfish.", "NTA one night a week of uninterrupted sleep should be the priority. I really don't see why your husband has a problem sleeping in the nursery one night to allow this.", "NTA.  He doesn't get to sleep through the hard parts of fatherhood.", "NTA. Sounds like he can't actually do his night of caring for the baby unless he is right there with the baby. He might not like it but it's fair, it's one night.\n\nAnd you waking to the sounds the baby makes are most certainly not an anxiety or paranoia problem; it's a simple biology and evolution thing. We are tuned to respond to the sounds of our babies. I saw a program that talked about how becoming a parent /the primary caregiver to a newborn literally makes changes in our brains that help us to be able to respond to their needs. Usually it is the mother that has this happen because usually the mother is most involved in newborn care. They used to think this was a \"female\" brain thing but have since discovered that it is an \"anybody\" brain thing, it happens to dads or other people that are the main newborn carer too. In your family obviously this is you, and he doesn't respond as well because his brain didn't adapt for that because he didn't need to - that's not a bad thing or criticism of him, it's just the role he has is the external working provider instead of the hands on care provider. It does mean, though, that he will have to make a bit of extra effort to make himself be the one who is ready to respond on his night so that you don't have to.\n\nRemind him as well that it's only likely to be a few months of this. Babies move through stages rapidly and learn to sleep through the night before they are one usually. He won't have to do it for too long but the difference it will make to your wellbeing in the meantime is huge. Quality rest truly is gold.", "NTA. Sleep is critical and getting you one uninterrupted night per week should be a high priority for both of you. There is a bed in there, it's not like you're asking him to sleep on the floor. \n\nHis idea of just shutting off the monitor is not developmentally appropriate for a 7 month old. You need to be able to hear sounds of distress.", "NTA. One night sleeping in a slightly less than ideal bed so your exhausted wife can get some sleep is an extremely reasonable thing to do. He is being selfish.", "NTA. He needs to do his fair share. Source-a sleep-deprived mom who can't get her husband to do even one night a week but wishes he would.", "Nta.   I can't even get started on the fact that your husband thinks that you are too anxious or paranoid, and that a monitor is a crutch, ect.  \n\nSir, you need to look up and read what happens to the brain of the main caregiver of a baby.  There is no excuse for this type of ignorance.", "> He thinks if I wake up to the baby on his night, that isn\u2019t his problem.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t your husband care about your well-being? He\u2019s TA, not you.", "NTA. Why don't you do a 4-week trial of this plan and then have a discussion about it again? See if you actually do get a better night's sleep. See if your husband does wake up and tend to him without being prodded by you. You're not anxious or paranoid. You have totally normal first-time mom attentiveness. A monitor is still important at this age.", "if the husband is reading this: YOU SUCK. let your wife have one night of decent sleep a week. this is pretty much the bare minimum a partner should be doing and you can\u2019t even do that. how pathetic.\n\nto OP: NTA. you are not paranoid for wanting to make sure that your child is being taken care of throughout the night.", "NTA. I don't understand the enabling anxious/paranoid behavior reasoning. Just like him being a deep sleeper isnt something he can help, you being a light sleeper isnt something you can help.\n\nPutting the baby monitor stuff aside, just talking about it logistically, the problem you are trying to solve is you getting a full nights sleep uninterrupted. In order to do that, he has to wake up for the 2am feeding. He cannot wake up for it without an alarm. So, you two cannot be in the same room on that night (he needs the alarm, it wakes you).\n\nHe could stay in the master if you could go elsewhere to get a full night's sleep.

I do personally feel though that he is basically relying on me to wake up if something unusual did happen, he might disagree.", "NTA for wanting the night off but if the husband never hears the baby how do you trust he will wake up and not leave the baby screaming and hungry.", "So he sets his alarm to feed the baby and doesn\u2019t sleep through that. He basically preemptively wakes up and gets a bottle ready just before my son would generally start getting hungry. When he is in the nursery with the baby I completely sleep through the night feed he does, otherwise I\u2019m at minimum waking up to his alarm but most often more.\n\nMy husband does still sleep through smaller noises (like when my son is quietly happily awake in the morning, it\u2019s pretty common for me to wake up in the morning and the baby is awake in the crib but husband is sleeping) but he also wakes up to a lot more when they are actually in the same room. For example he would sleep through loud cooing in our bedroom but not in the nursery. I definitely think he would wake up to something going wrong, such as arms/legs in crib bars", "So we actually currently have this arrangement (which my husband wants to change) and I do in fact sleep through the night when he is in the nursery with the baby.

You are right, baby might wake up at any time, he is being very irresponsible.", "NTA.  One night a week YOU sleep in the nursery and put the baby in the master with him.  He doesn't want to be a dad, sounds like he was just a sperm donor.", "NTA. Good grief, the standards for fathers are on the FLOOR.\n\nMy husband also works a 4/10 with an early start. He's a deep sleeper by nature. But he realized I needed sleep, too, for my health and for our baby's. If I'm exhausted all the time, I can't keep our kid safe. I need rest to function. \n\nSo he started taking shifts sleeping in a guest room with the monitor turned up high, so I could sleep. \n\nNow our child is four, and he's still just as likely as I am to get up if she has a bad dream or needs something.\n\nSo sick of the \"deep sleeper\" excuse.", "If you are trying this out right now, and you're getting the full night sleep, for him, what is the current issue with sleeping in the other room for one night other than the fact that it's just not in the master? Is the bed more comfortable in the master bedroom? \n\nPersonally, your husband should suck it up until this phase is over. It's just one night. There is still a bed. Not getting enough sleep means you're always tired and you won't be at 100% during the day. Because not only are you taking care of your kid, your body is still recovering from giving birth. \n\nIt's not going to be forever as you said.

My wife and I both do the middle of the night feeds together, despite both working. You guys should be a team and if he\u2019s getting uninterrupted sleep most nights the least he can do is give you that when he can.", "He gets three days off.  He can deal with it as it is only temporary.  Everyone thinks that SAHM is a cake job.  Well, it's not.  I saw what my wife went through during my career in the Navy and always out to sea.  She's a freaking superhero.  Our family would be nothing without her sacrifices.", "NTA. Your husband is though. \n\nIn an equal partnership you shouldn't have to beg your husband for one night of sleep while he gets six. Even if he's a \"breadwinner\". Husband works 8-10 hours a day, with apparently 3 day weekends and thinks he deserves a break, but mom works 24 hours a day with no weekend and doesn't deserve a break? \n\nThere also shouldn't be any reason your husband immediately dismisses all of your concerns by saying it's not his problem, you should \"deal with it\", or claiming you have unreasonable anxiety. Pretty reminiscent of all the men and doctors who used to write off anything women said as \"hysteria\" so they didn't have to treat women like human beings with their own valid emotions and opinions. \n\nMr. Husband may do well to read https://matthewfray.com/2016/01/14/she-divorced-me-because-i-left-dishes-by-the-sink/", "NTA, for wanting a night off!

He could see how tired I was and he prioritised my need for a good sleep over his preference. Tbh I wouldn\u2019t have had more than one kid if I\u2019d not had his support like this!

Just be prepared for that.", "ESH\nFor anyone who doesn't have kids yet, put this on your list of things to discuss before your child is born. Have a plan to overcome stalemates when your opinions differ.\nIf my hubby tried to tell me where I am allowed to sleep, that would be a hard pass.

Turn off the monitor!

When my firstborn was a newborn my husband would literally sleep inches from her screaming face when I would try to settle her in bed. When she got a bit older, we decided he would be responsible for giving her the pacifier and night time diaper changes and then he would give her to me to nurse to sleep.\n\nOnce we made that change, he would wake up from all the small noises. And since it wasn\u2019t my responsibility to wake up until she needed to nurse, I could actually sleep through many noises. \n\nAnd then we got or second kid and suddenly I woke up from every small noise again until we started having the same arrangement. \n\nMy husband is also responsible for taking our older daughter to the bathroom during the night (since she is now potty trained).

Still not 100% fair but he is a first responder and needed sleep for safety reasons.", "She should go get a job for those 3 nights then.", "Maybe because then husband will have to care for a 7 month old alone rather than both of them having an easier day? Looking after a baby IS WORK.", "Working isn't that hard, dude. Most everyone has done it.", "He doesn't wake up. He doesn't hear the baby or the monitor.
