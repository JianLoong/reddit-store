She was offended and told me our names were given to us to follow us through life and my wife and I cannot say the same for our son, or for her and her siblings. I said I did think of his future and him being an old man with the name. I told her I know adults with unusual or unique names and they're proud of them. I said not everyone is but not everyone isn't and it's normal for my family now to have unusual names.\n\nI again reiterated that I did not care and told her to leave me the fuck alone.

Also Lake isn't even that weird.", "NTA - your sister sound super pleasant /s", "She doesn't have deeper issues with my wife. She's got some strong beliefs when it comes to names and she's a bit of a name snob in some ways. I think that's got more to do with it than issues with us personally.", "The deeper issue is what I\u2019m thinking too.", "Yes, she expects us to change the name and to find one more classic for our son. Also she is aware and she does believe that my wife and her siblings suffered more due to their names than they say. Even when they say they love their names and didn't have trouble. She believes it's untrue.", "The *sin* typo caught me off guard while drinking my coffee.", "I don't want anyone to judge the name. Just to judge how I responded to my sister.", "Your sister is the AH. Part of being an adult is putting up with the harmless things that other adults do that you wouldn\u2019t do yourself. Your sister needs to grow up and get over herself.", "IDK, I would take this opportunity to legally rename myself Tank or Valheim or something dope af. Then when she brings up the issue with that, then just ask \"so are we not siblings anymore?\" That'll shove the ol' sock in the mouth.", "Your sister is just plain rude and also arrogant. She thinks her opinion matters more than yours or your wife's.", "If she messages you about the name leave her on read, if she calls you about the name hang up, if she\u2019s trying to talk about the name in person walk away eventually she will realize she\u2019s not getting the desired effect she\u2019s wanting and she\u2019ll stop. Also I\u2019d not let her around my child period or the very least unsupervised.", "Your sister is being stupid. You\u2019re NTA! Lake is a beautiful name", "NTA Luke is a completely normal non exotic name like Emily, James, etc.\n\nIt\u2019s in the Bible man the name is not in any way exotic unless you are from a non English speaking country.", "Your sister sounds very arrogant thinking she knows someone else's experience better than they do. Is she always this opinionated? Sorry about her, I hope she stops. \n\nBe careful, if she continues to have contact with your son I think it's very likely she will tell him exactly what she thinks of his name without considering how hurtful that will be to him. Because she's right and just being honest of course.", "I have an unusual name (i'm the only one with that name in my country, maybe in the world, but not sure of the last one) and sometimes people pronounce it wrong, but i wasn't bullied because of my name growing up. People pronouncing it wrong isn't a big issue as i can always correct them.", "You have heard her out; anything else is repetition progressing to bullying. Maybe time to go broken record, or \u201casked and answered\u201d on her. Don\u2019t argue but instead treat it as the most boring topic in the world that ends your interactions as soon as she brings it up.\n\nIt sounds like a fine name, and her naming obsession means she probably wouldn\u2019t be satisfied until you gave her control. Which would be way out of line. This is your decision to make, together with your wife, and you have made it; the end.", "what are her children named?", "Another name kerfuffle. OP's children, OP's names. If the sister is so concerned, she should name her children her way and see if they can succeed in life just on the basis of a name and butt out of other people's business.", "Lake, not luke.", "We\u2019ll that\u2019s a lil early morning dyslexia for ya folks.  LAKE is a mildly weird name as it\u2019s a bit femme but like\u2026people have been calling kids Lake, Isle, and Ocean for a long ass time so it\u2019s not SUPER different\u2014but she\u2019s right it\u2019s not a classic lol.  But if you know any hippies\u2026..\n\nI\u2019ve got relatives with names like Lyric for a boy, and Cedar for a girl.\n\nDo I think my SIL gave her kids dog names?  Yes.\n\nLake is pretty reasonable.", "Yes, when it comes to names she can be. Not always. She had gotten a little better. From about 16 to 22 she was really obnoxious about it and she thought because she had a list of baby names and a set style that she was an expert and could judge other people's name choices.", "Does she have any kids of her own?", "She sounds awful. Like that chick that gets mad because a strangers picked \u201cher\u201d baby name. Also very entitled to think she has the right to taint such a beautiful thing for you. She must not have children because if she does she is just completely out of touch on what it is to be a good human being. \n\nUltimately she\u2019s saying she will act differently towards your son because she looks down on his name. So tragic"]}
