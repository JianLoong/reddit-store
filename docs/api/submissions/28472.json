Yes people will criticize you, people comment on the name, people will overstep their boundaries. However, you're going to get the people of that compliment the name! You're going to get people that get excited and inspire them to do the same or maybe they might tell a family member who's pregnant of your child's name and that family member might be inspired to name their child a unique name that's very special.

Fuck that shit man she\u2019s trying to pimp you guys and make you think you\u2019re in the wrong. You did nothing wrong and your kids name has no impact on her life, she doesn\u2019t have any inherent right to name your child.

I'll be honest, when I first read it; I thought it was an exceedingly unusual choice. But TBH when I think on it the more I like it. I'm from the South with a strict naming culture, so I get where she's coming from.

I'm not a fan of non traditional names personally, but imo a better move would be to wait, see if the person with the name grows to dislike it. If he does in fact want to change it of his own volition, his aunt can offer to pay the cost when he's an older teen or young adult.

They're actually a very traditional, ancient form of name.\n\nFor example, *Bryn* is a traditional Welsh boys name and is the Welsh word for 'hill'. \n\nMy Welsh teacher (m) in school was called *Nantlais* and that means 'voice of/like the stream'.\n\nI had an uncle called *Islwyn* - that means 'under a grove'.\n\n*Heulwen* is a fairly popular girls name and means 'sunshine'.\n\nEven in English, why are certain nature names, particularly flower names and those of precioys or semi-precious stoones, deemed appropriate? Some are so normalised that, when used as names, it's easy to forget their origins:\n\nRowan, Brooke, Rose, Lily, Violet, Flora, Fleur (borrowed from French, obviously!), Hazel, Coral, Daisy, Oliver, Olive (and Olivia), Robin, Glenn, Heather, Dawn, Dale, Cliff...\n\nBut others are seen as more modern and trendy, but gaining acceptance:\n\nRiver, Stone, Forest, Ocean (or Oc\u00e9an here in France), Autumn, Summer, Aurora, Jade (huge here in France and was no. 1 for years!), Misty...\n\nBut then others are still seen as being completely out there, for hippy, crunchy, new age type parents only! \n\nLake, Oak, Raven, Meadow, Luna, Orion, Rain...\n\nOr perhaps parents from certain parts of the US, with more rural lifestyles (particularly for some of the boys' names that seem to draw on a sense of strength, resilience and reinforce masculinity?):\n\nColt (one never knows if this is based on a young horse, the gun manufacturer, or both?), Steel, Hawk, Reed, Drake, Blaze, Storm, Terra, Flint...\n\nThere are other nature names that used to be used by the Victorians (their love for natural history inspired an enduring trend, still ongoing today, for first names inspired by the natural world) but are now considered too old-fashioned to be used by anyone except the very upper class in the UK (and are then immediately shortened to something more acceptable) and the most ardent name nerd!\n\nPeregrine, Myrtle, Oleander, Daffodil,...\n\nWhy do we accept some of these as perfectly acceptable names and turn our noses up at others?\n\nIt's all just snobbery, or inverse snobbery, if you like!\n\nAll names have to come from somewhere and were used for the first time by someone, at some time or other.\n\nOtherwise we'd all be called one of the many, many variants of John or Jane that exist in every European language, and possibly others too?\n\nExpanding a little, we'd all be called a name found in the bible.\n\nDrawing from nature is, at least, a source of inspiration that makes sense and has some meaning.", "Say what you will about that character, I don't think he's ever been in a bad comic. \n\n\"Spyder\" makes me think of Miguel Nunez's character from Return of the Living Dead, and that was a great dude.
