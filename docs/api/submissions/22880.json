The MIL saying \u201cfine put the other family first\u201d is entirely manipulative, and all the constant asks and wants are really interfering with your marriage. I understand being really upset with this because there *has* to be a middle ground everyone can reach.\n\nHowever, maybe not the smartest move to blow up in front of them. YTA for that. I know you said you\u2019ve talked to your wife about this, but all these feelings need to be sorted out with her and her alone. The instinct of your in-laws will be to get incredibly defensive and angry. Idk them personally but this may be hard for them to forgive and forget.\n\nI hope you guys can work through it as a family and try to find appropriate balance between what is an actual reasonable amount they can reach out to her for help without taking up too much of her time and getting in the middle of your marriage. Good luck with everything \u2764\ufe0f", "The biggest problem here is your wife, not your ILs. She\u2019s allowing herself to be guilted and used by her parents. You need to deliver her some kind of harsh ultimatum, like either she needs to stand up to her parents or you\u2019ll be leaving her. \n\nSo I say NTA for feeling what you feel but please target the right person here.", "ESH. For one thing, this conversation never should have been had *in front of the parents*. It's pretty obvious that your wife's parents are important to her, and now you've turned them against you. Not smart.\n\nYou guys clearly did not discuss boundaries with the in-laws before you got married, and that is the crux of the problem here. Your expectations were that you would become the most important person in her life when you got married. She is still putting her parents first. Neither of you are wrong, but this is something that should have been figured out before marriage--how to care for ailing parents is a very important conversation topic for engaged/soon to be engaged couples, and I hate to break it to you, but this is only going to get worse as they age. This is why you don't marry someone you didn't date for very long, these things don't get hashed out the way they should.", "INFO: Just want to check that this was not the first time your wife has heard this from you?", "She is choosing her parents over your marriage, and demonstrates this by putting the majority of her time and effort into serving them. When she got married, her loyalty and devotion should have switched from her parents to your. She should have YOUR back, as you have hers.\n\nNTA OP. You are correct - it\u2019s her job to manager her people, so if she wants to save your marriage, she needs to grow a backbone and tell them where to go.", "NTA but I kind of hate that her biggest issue is being a doormat for her parents demands and then you schedule a trip to go help your parents move. I mean, neither sounds appetizing to me, she's basically just always getting asked to do someone a favor and you already know she's not going to say no. She needs to stand up to her family and your parents need to hire a mover. She needs to get herself out of the cycle and you need to not request things of her that put her right back in that while she's growing a backbone and learning to say no.", "Perhaps ESH. \n\nYour wife is being a doormat and letting her parents walk all over her and your relationship. She needs to set some boundaries and prioritize your marriage. Her parents are being selfish and manipulative, and they don't appreciate her efforts. They need to respect your time and space as a couple. \n\nYou are justified in being frustrated and angry, but you shouldn't have blown up in front of them. That was disrespectful and counterproductive. \n\nYou should have talked to your wife privately and calmly, and maybe suggested some counseling or mediation to help you resolve this issue.", "ESH. I would have never tried to have the conversation in front of the parents, but if your wife is as spineless as you make her seem, then it may have been the only resort. At the very least, the ball is in EVERYONE\u2019s court now. Your in-laws will show their true colors in the upcoming months. If they continue asking for help, then they clearly only care about their errands getting done. If your wife continues to devote all her time, then you have your answer.", "ESH Only because you shouldn\u2019t have done it in front of her parents. Serious discussions/heated ones should be handled in private, but I do understand this has been building up inside of you. Plus, a positive that may come out of this, is now maybe her parents will realize what effect their demands are having on their daughters marriage. They do sound like AHs tho so they also may not care,but let\u2019s try to be positive. Your wife should not be pushing off her responsibilities in the house you both live, to go be a doormat to her parents. However, as a former doormat, it is not an easy transition. Expect for this to take time. But first and foremost, you need to have a calm and serious conversation with your wife. I would start by apologizing for blowing up at her in front of her parents. This will make her feel more comfortable and open to talking about mistakes she has made. Next I would be very clear \u201cI love you but you catering to your parents constant demands is making me feel alone in this marriage. This is suppose to be a partnership between me and you. It\u2019s not a partnership when I have to do everything alone. We never get time to just enjoy each other.

First, it's HER decision to continue to do it. She is the only one who can or will decide to change this behavior. Second, it's frankly something you and she needed to have a deep conversation about PRIVATELY to address this elephant in your relationship.\n\nLastly, by blowing up and causing a confrontation with the parents, you embarrassed and upset your wife and basically started a giant fight between them. All that does is cause resentment because you didn't talk to your spouse and make sure you were BOTH on the same page.\n\nIf it's a deal breaker for you, then YOU make that choice WITH your wife's involvement.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They're very old-school and to some extent they believe I should be \"in charge\" of the marriage as a male, but that's not what I'm looking for here and not something I'm trying to promote or take advantage of.

The main point here wasn't ailing parents, both her parents are in their early 50s and perfectly healthy. THEY are the main carers for her grandma, who is also still relatively healthy for her age (74). They simply ask my wife to do a load of stuff for them because they claim she has more time to do all these things. She can get a call with a simple MS Office question from her not-so-tech-savvy parents one moment, and the next she's being asked (almost yelled at) to go mow their lawn and empty their dishwasher because they've got people coming over and they won't get around to it in time: I wish I was making this up.   \n\n\nKey point I forgot to add into the post above is that this also automatically (due to how much time the driving/task takes) causes her to neglect the household duties we share in OUR household: this means I do all the work inside the house, in addition to caring for two pets and a full-time job now.   \n\n\nI do 100% agree in front of her parents wasn't the place for this argument to have occurred. I guess I didn't worry much about boundaries in the past. We never really felt interference from anything let alone her parents before. I've debated couples' or even family therapy and am very willing, but both her and her parents \"don't believe in therapy\".   \n\n\n(Definitely open to tips on how to get people to open to the idea of Therapy.)   \n\n\nSorry for the huge comment!", "I've had several conversations with her, where she'd feel like a bad wife and get generally down on herself. I'd comfort her and explain I don't resent her, but that these are issues that will snowball into something far worse and that quite frankly, I'm also overloaded now picking up the slack in the household WE have. Always she was super understanding of the situation, and she says all the perfect right things.\n\nShe's made commitments to improve this situation a few times now as well, but unfortunately that never materialized. Effectively, all I've really asked for is help with the household stuff since I physically cannot do it all with the amount of time I have as well as a handful of \"quality time\"-moments (like maybe 1 date a month, and a few \"blocks\" in our schedules for some movies or video games which we used to play a lot together, or a slightly longer walk with our doggo in the park).

Thanks for the insight", "Understandable, and I wanted to clarify this further but 3k character limit.   \n\n\nHer involvement in that was totally voluntary. She volunteered when one of the buddies I planned to take with me for the driving piece had an accident at work. \n\nShe wasn't initially part of the moving effort at all (we can't rely on her work schedule).\n\nShe definitely has a backbone, and she definitely can say no. To me, her friends, colleagues etc, she does all the time. That's part of where my frustration comes from: it's always NO to me and YES to them. It's purely and strictly with her family/parents that she just lets them walk all over her. My point in referencing the trip was that we counted on her and she dropped a fairly serious commitment last second purely due to guilt from her mother. \n\nAs for why no movers, my parents are elderly and not very stable financially (mom has permanent spinal damage, stepdad has lung cancer), so it was going to be a manual effort from the get-go by someone close to them as to minimize cost. They mustered a couple of people to help us with the efforts, though. \n\nGiven the hundreds of favors I've done my wife's parents over the years, including also helping them move in the past, I'd feel pretty disgusted with myself if I then didn't help my own parents move...", "I feel like this is the answer. The parents *are* being selfish and manipulative (I doubt They're paying for gas or anything for the 3 hour trip), and I'd bet they raised the wife so that she can't say no to them. However, she does need to learn to stand up for herself.\n\nAnd yeah. OP's feelings are valid, and exploding wasn't a good option. I do think the issue should have been brought up in front of the parents, but more in a \"why are you treating wife like your personal slave?\" way instead of getting mad at her in front of them.

For me that didn't really change until my father became too old to successfully beat me (literally..), but I recall that even when the threat was completely 100% gone, the anxiety it riddled me with to even \"think\" about going against them was immense, which all the while makes me feel much, much worse about the situation now with my wife. \n\nReally appreciated the advice about how to approach this. I'm usually great with words, people and conflict, but I'll admit I don't know left from right anymore when it comes knocking on my own door threatening my marriage. This helped!", "Thanks for this advice x2 - helped me get my wife over the line for therapy.

Talking privately about it seems to lead nowhere. Thanks for the insight!", "It is not so weird, and I can totally see how it made it worse. \n\nHer parents don't have her back. They devalue her as a woman and as a person.\n\nSo they'll bully her into doing what they want and call her a bad daughter if she won't.\n\nBut if a third party, especially a man, her husband, blames her for her behavior, well of course they'll be only too happy to jump on that bandwagon and to call her a bad woman/bad wife.\n\nIt doesn't matter that they are being hypocritical by blaming her for things they made her do. Being unfair and destroying her self-esteem is the whole point. \n\nAs for making it worse : she must feel very betrayed because no matter what she does, she loses in their eyes. And because of your outburst they now know you are angry against her and they now have more ammunition against her. \n\nBut she has to see you are not the enemy. You don't have double standards. If she chooses to prioritize you, you won't then turn around and call her a bad daughter. You will have her back. \n\nTherapy would be good for you as a couple but also for her alone, on her own, to untangle herself from her lousy parents.", "Your wife needs to learn to say no.

I\u2019m the same age as your in laws. I take care of my elderly parents. I don\u2019t ask for help from my kids except when I go on vacation. Her parents will likely need her help in the future, but they need to take care of themselves now. You\u2019re at the stage of life where you should be building the foundation of a long lasting marriage. Get your wife into therapy ASAP.", "I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re feeling that way but I understand it. If she\u2019s not willing to work on it too, then the marriage is not worth it.", "I mean, my point still stands. They may not be \"ailing\" from a health standpoint, but they clearly still need her help.

Again, this is something you guys needed to get on the same page on before it already started happening. And before you were married.

I definitely didn't think of it from that perspective, and the LAST thing I want to do is either give her parents more ammunition against her, or make her feel like she's a bad wife. She is great. She has been nothing short of wonderful throughout this whole relationship up until recently. I know she feels she's in a lose/lose and I really just wish I could persuade her to consider therapy. I won't give up though. If the marriage has a chance I'm down to exhaust all options", "I thought we were on the same page. We agreed if anything would be needed on both ends of the family we'd come through together first and foremost and make it work for all parties without compromising our own life. \n\nWithout a shred of doubt the most mature relationship I'd ever been in, all prior situations with her parents were totally fine and maturely handled, until this situation unfolded. \n\nIt's a tricky one because I can survive reduced levels of affection and attention for a certain amount of time, but there has to be \"some\" balance for me, too. Our pets are another story though: lots of attention needed, and combined with full-time work and now 2x the household work, it's not sustainable even if I'd want it to be.  \n \n\nI genuinely want this to work and will keep pushing for couples therapy in this, but I'm afraid if I can't make her see how bad it's gotten that I won't be able to do much to prevent the inevitable. Which really, really, really sucks.   \n\n\nI love her to death but I'm drowning myself here, and I have to figure it out with 0 help from her... Sorry to rant, but I appreciate your comments", "Both European immigrants from the same original area in Southern Europe. Exact same cultural background and upbringing, which does include a huge deal of family love and not leaving your parents out in the cold. \n\nI definitely don't want to make it out to be like I clash with her family or we don't get along. They love me, I love them. Throughout the relationship I've been close to them and even pushed my wife to reconnect with her parents more deeply to fix their rocky relationship in the first place. Hell, my wife claims I'm part-responsible for her being so close with her mother again. I worked a lot to get their blessing to join their family and they've never made me feel left out before. They also get along excellently with my family, and my wife is adored by my own mother. \n\nEverything was genuinely without flaws (as cliche as that is to say) until relatively recently, which makes this all the more shitty... I genuinely do not comprehend where this 180 came from, for the life of me. Nothing drastic changed in anyone's lives. We've always done plenty for them when needed/asked, but it just used to be more balanced and compromised, so it didn't cause any harm.    \n\n\nEven more shitty, it's divided the ENTIRE family now.", "I didn't say anything about elder care in this comment. I'm talking about the role her parents play in her life. You're missing the point--and even if elder care is not the topic at hand *right now*, it will be eventually. And you guys needed to get on the same page yesterday, or you will continue to harbor resentment towards her for the way she is handling things. Communication of expectations is the single most important thing in a marriage. And you guys are failing at that right now.", "Driving 3 hours round trip to empty a dishwasher IS elder care, in a sense. You should not have blown up at them, but also it sounds like you have/had a decent relationship with them up to now. Therefore you should have felt comfortable raising your concerns without blowing up at them. You could have simply said that you and your wife haven't had a weekend alone together in a very long time and that you have plans together. That it would upset you if you had to cancel due to \"chores \" in someone else's household. And continue to discuss how many chores she is doing for her parents but not in her own home, and that things have gotten out of balance.  It was a discussion to be had. Try re-approaching the conversation that way, with them all together and see if you get anywhere. How they respond will tell you what you need to know about the future. Because people in their 50s are not that old and should be perfectly capable of time management,  emptying dishwashers and doing standard household chores. If there's time to invite guests, there's time to prep for them. And if not, there's a hired service for that, too. Establish boundaries on things that merit a 3 hour RT drive and things that don't. Good luck!", "Thank you both for the insight, it's appreciated. I'm pushing for counseling for sure.", "Is moving closer to them an option? So she doesn't have to drive 3 hours round trip on seemingly a daily basis?", "You welcome!", "We've talked about it earlier this year, and I'd be fine with it since I work remotely, but this would set us back financially quite a lot, so easier said than done. It could work out towards end of next year when I'm due to receive a bonus at work that would definitely solve that, but I'm not sure the current situation can be sustained for that long."]}
