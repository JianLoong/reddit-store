At 18 he's old enough to 1) not hide in your room to vape (which could cause trouble for you if your parents smell it), and 2) realize that it's your \\*parents\\* house (not his) and if they don't want him vaping in it he can quit, do it somewhere else, or stop living under their roof.", "NTA you warned him you didn\u2019t like it.", "I don't feel like you're the asshole.

OP asked him to refrain from vaping in his room and his brother ignored him.  OP warned him and he still didn't stop.  Why is brother mad when OP warned him?

It\u2019s well within your rights to then go to the homeowners - your parents - and say he\u2019s vaping in your room.

When my wife is vaping in our spare bedroom I can instantly tell when I go in there after.\n\nNot that it matters, since OP doesn't want his brother to do it in his room and that should be the end of it. OP is definitely NTA, big bro can respect his brother's space while he is in his room or he can go \"act like himself\" somewhere else."]}
