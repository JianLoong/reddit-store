I just moved to a new post in December and he and I met in January. We went on a 30 day training exercise together and just got back. We\u2019ve only just started talking to each other less than 2 months ago, he tells people he\u2019s my \u201cgay best friend\u201d but I only consider us acquaintances. He is a rank lower than me and has to live in the barracks but I don\u2019t.\n\nWhen we got back, he said he lost his barracks key and doesn\u2019t have a means to get it that night. He said he can only get it the next monday(we arrived on a weekend). He asked to stay with me for those days and I said yes. When the weekday came, I drove him to work and then he texted me at the end of the day to say he couldn\u2019t find his barracks manager and needs to come back to my place. He invited someone he\u2019s never met to my house, he woke me up at midnight to go pick up his friend that was also apparently locked out of his barracks room. He woke me up at 04:00 the next morning to take the friend back.\n\nJohn spent the entire week in my house, and I have had to drive him and this other guy everywhere. At the end of the week, he told me that he still hadn\u2019t found his barracks manager and that he will be spending the 4 day weekend at my house. I am an introvert and I do not like people in my space for that long. I also do not have furniture besides a bed and a chair so I\u2019ve been sleeping on the ground this whole time. After sleeping outside on the ground for 16 days during this exercise and on an uncomfortable cot the rest of the days, you can see how I might want my bed instead of the floor? I am also doing online college and classes started while he was with me but I could not study or attend zoom classes in the house because he\u2019s loud and is always interrupting me.\n\nI finally had enough and I booked a hotel room for the 4 day weekend. I lied and told him I was going out of town for the weekend. Somebody else we work with saw me in town and must have told him. He texted me and accused me of being a bad friend, claimed he only stayed because he didn\u2019t want me to be lonely over the 4 day and that he thought I enjoyed his company. He said I was a terrible person for lying about where I was. He put me on blast on our platoon group page and accused me of being fake.\n\nMultiple people from the group have texted me and are saying it was bad of me to leave him alone in the house, that I shouldn\u2019t have offered to let him stay with me if I was just going to abandon him, and that I shouldn\u2019t have lied to him about where I was.\n\nI think I might be the AH because I lied about where I was, and because I left him by himself in my apartment all weekend knowing he had no car to get around. I also think I have the right to want some peace and quite and an actual bed after everything I went through the month prior.\nI am bringing it to you impartial people.

Dude, come on.", "Oh, honey \u2026\n\n\nYou left your own apartment to go stay in a hotel rather than say no to a \u201cfriend.\u201d  Please think about that.  IT IS OK TO SAY NO.  People don\u2019t own you, your time, your emotions, or your property.  Saying no doesn\u2019t make you a bad person or selfish - it makes you smart and responsible.  Choose for yourself when to say yes.  And when to say no.  And who to say them to.", "NTA - since you are a higher rank, see to it yourself that he makes contact with the barracks manager or even call the barracks manager yourself. Under the guise of looking out for a Soldier/Airman/Marine, get him out of your apartment.", "NTA instead of you getting a hotel room you should have kicked him out. Who needs friends like this guy.", "He has a place to stay. He doesn't want to.", "If he can't find the barracks manager he can find his 1st Sgt. He's either really stupid or he's pulling one over on you. Take his ass back to base.", "He knew he was an inconvenience...you were sleeping on the floor.\n\nHe was just taking advantage of you being non-confrontational.  You don't owe him any guilt or apology.  Or continued friendship.", "Seriously, friend, you need to develop the essential life skill of being honest with other people and standing up for yourself.", "Dead ferret?", "Ah missed the gbf part somehow. Dude is a user. He can go ahead and use any one of the people putting OP on blast.", "Well you never know, he says he\u2019s gay but people have lied about that to get close to people.", "You need to grow a spine. Plus, \u2018your friend\u2019 is using you.", "Slight AH for letting him \u2018put you out of your own place\u2019. He needs to suck it up and figure things out on his own. Don\u2019t be a doormat for him or anybody else.", "NTA. But what did I just read? He says he was only staying with you so you wouldn\u2019t be lonely. Like what? But you had to sleep on the floor in your own home. You are way too nice I think. Unless they were family I actually liked or a close friend I would have kicked him out after the first night. Assuming I let him stay in the first place.", "NTA\nNot even remotely could you be considered the AH in this situation. He took advantage of your kindness by not only allowing him to stay, but also by running him back and forth to post, and even allowing his friend to visit let alone stay the night.", "You're being a major AH to yourself. Stop letting people walk all over you. NTA", "He can go to the barracks NCO or CQ to get access to his room. He lied to you.\n\nNta", "NTA \n\n\n\nExpose his lies now", "ESH him for obvious reasons and you for not just kicking him out. A simple \u2018hey man I need some time alone\u2019 is enough. Time to set some boundaries.", "I think you need to get better at saying no and establishing boundaries. You're 26, you need to be able to do this.\n\nNTA, but it might be worth getting some help.", "I don\u2019t really understand why he invited someone OP never met to her house because uh\u2026 a dick move. And that\u2019s without the other asshole moves so yeah\u2026 NTA, OP", "Sorry but why are you such a pushover that you\u2019re sleeping on the floor and paying for a hotel to get away from them? You don\u2019t have to worry about being an AH, just about being a doormat. I honestly don\u2019t understand why you put up with this.", "He\u2019s a grifter. Why would you let him steamroll you like this?  The military has someone on duty 24/7. He can get into his barracks. He has ulterior motives where you are concerned. Send him away.", "Tbh if OP is Canadian these aren't worries/issues. Depending on rank you wouldn't pull rank on someone outside of work. And the CAF has worked very hard to get rid of rape culture in the military. Although  OP used the words barracks manager and I've never heard that before and my long term partner is career military and currently on a course in a different city and living in the shacks. Also shame on this dude for not letting OP have her own fucking bed. When my partner came back from a field exercise that only lasted like 5 days he NEEDED his bed.", "That\u2019s not how genuine friends act. This guy is a liar and a shameless user", "Awesome that there is no rape in Canada! Good to know!", "NTA, but dude stop being a doormat.", "NTA But I don't understand why you didn't just say no to him? You have that choice, you know that right", "You should never have let him into your apartment.  Bad decision.   These training events engender a false sense of intimacy.  He is not your friend.  He could have Ubered or rented a car.   He could have rented a hotel room.  It sounds like he is broke in addition to being careless.", "Honestly, wtf is wrong with you?  Do you not know how to say no?  YTA for treating yourself like shit, but NTA for lying to your work buddy, who is most clearly not your friend.", "This. NTA. But, OP, people call me a doormat, and I think you're even worse than a doormat. After the first day, you should have told him he couldn't stay with you again. That you need your own bed. He would have figured it out. He's taking advantage of you. Stop letting him.\n\nTell everyone the truth. Get him out of your place. Block him on everything. And move on with your life. If the harassment continues, talk to someone above both of you.", "He's gay. I doubt she's his type.", "You cannot possibly believe he's spent weeks looking for the person in charge of the barracks.  Do officers in your military just leave their posts without being replaced?", "He's lying, you deep down know that. He's had his key this whole time.", "I lol'd. Probably also expect to be addressed by their partner's rank.", "YTA.  Not for abandoning him, but for being suckered in to begin with.  The whole \"locked out of the barracks and can't get in\" excuse is suspect.  Was the barracks totally empty?  No other people assigned to that barracks?  They couldn't knock on the door and get in?  Did he still have all his gear with him from the training exercise?  If not, where did he leave it?  Usually the military assigns people from the same command/unit to the same barracks - makes it easier to find them in the middle of the night if there is a sudden change in plans.  Couldn't find the barracks manager for a solid week?  What, was he washing his uniform every night at your place?  \n\nEither this is fake as hell, you aren't in the USA or you people are assigned to a base that bears no resemblance to any of the ones my two brothers, one brother-in-law and my son have served at in the last ten years.", "God help us if we go to war. LMAO", "NTA but you can\u2019t let people walk all over you like this. You will lose respect and won\u2019t be taken seriously at work.", ">always want to keep the peace.\n\nBut whose peace were you keeping? Was it \u201cpeaceful\u201d to sleep on the floor? \n\nWas it peaceful driving people around day and night? Was it peaceful paying for a hotel room when you have a perfectly good home to stay in?\n\nWhose peace were you keeping?", "He is gay and did not try anything in the 16 days in a tiny apartment with only one bed", "As it turns out maple syrup and moose are a combination which kills that urge in humans.\n\nJust ask all the indigenous women in canada...", "INFO:  Why did you give him your bed?", "NTA\n\nKick him out\n\nWhat he is doing is taking your undue advantage and smearing your name. This is most likely harassment", ">He put me on blast on our platoon group page and accused me of being fake.\n\nwhat unit are you in? the flower arranging special forces? this story is badly fabricated.", "NTA.  You were trying to avoid hurting his feelings and leaving him without a place.  He has abused your kindness.  You need to kick him out.", "This guy pisses me off. OP you're NTA and dunno if you gonna read this when I'm posting so late, but he's clearly manipulating you into getting sweeter living arrangement.\n\nFirst: the story about being locked out is bull\\*\\*\\*\\*. It was plausible when it was just a weekend. But he had whole f\\*ing monday to get hold of his barrack manager or somehow solve his situation. If he really cared, it would have been solved.\n\nSecond: I have a suspicion he thought you're an easy target for some reason. Maybe because you're a woman and women get a lot of prejudice against them in military. He didn't like how he has to live in the barracks. So he kinda loved bombed you by telling you you're his bestie to make you feel guilty later. Then made up some sob story about being locked out, then told his buddy how he has this sweet deal outside of the barracks and moved him in with you with the same sob story. Than he tried to publicly shame you because you refused to be his taxi driver and delivery service. \n\nOP it's time for you to get angry and petty. Kick those leeches out. And don't trust a word that comes out of this persons mouth.", "Respectfully, you are an NCO, right? Where the hell is your spine? I absolutely would have respected any of my NCO's less for allowing themselves in to a situation like this. You need to take a step back and examine & reevaluate yourself.", "Well he lies to spend more time with OP, so you\u2019re more optimistic than I am that things like that can be taken at face value.  For both him and the randos he brings over.", "And if he can't, his chain of command certainly can."]}
