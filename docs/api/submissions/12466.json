{"id": 12466, "submission_id": "11szdjk", "title": "AITA for leaving my \u201cfriend\u201d alone in my apartment and getting a hotel room for 4 days knowing he had no car and would be stranded?", "selftext": "Me 26F and my friend 25M \u201cJohn\u201d are both in the military. I just moved to a new post in December and he and I met in January. We went on a 30 day training exercise together and just got back. We\u2019ve only just started talking to each other less than 2 months ago, he tells people he\u2019s my \u201cgay best friend\u201d but I only consider us acquaintances. He is a rank lower than me and has to live in the barracks but I don\u2019t.\n\nWhen we got back, he said he lost his barracks key and doesn\u2019t have a means to get it that night. He said he can only get it the next monday(we arrived on a weekend). He asked to stay with me for those days and I said yes. When the weekday came, I drove him to work and then he texted me at the end of the day to say he couldn\u2019t find his barracks manager and needs to come back to my place. He invited someone he\u2019s never met to my house, he woke me up at midnight to go pick up his friend that was also apparently locked out of his barracks room. He woke me up at 04:00 the next morning to take the friend back.\n\nJohn spent the entire week in my house, and I have had to drive him and this other guy everywhere. At the end of the week, he told me that he still hadn\u2019t found his barracks manager and that he will be spending the 4 day weekend at my house. I am an introvert and I do not like people in my space for that long. I also do not have furniture besides a bed and a chair so I\u2019ve been sleeping on the ground this whole time. After sleeping outside on the ground for 16 days during this exercise and on an uncomfortable cot the rest of the days, you can see how I might want my bed instead of the floor? I am also doing online college and classes started while he was with me but I could not study or attend zoom classes in the house because he\u2019s loud and is always interrupting me.\n\nI finally had enough and I booked a hotel room for the 4 day weekend. I lied and told him I was going out of town for the weekend. Somebody else we work with saw me in town and must have told him. He texted me and accused me of being a bad friend, claimed he only stayed because he didn\u2019t want me to be lonely over the 4 day and that he thought I enjoyed his company. He said I was a terrible person for lying about where I was. He put me on blast on our platoon group page and accused me of being fake.\n\nMultiple people from the group have texted me and are saying it was bad of me to leave him alone in the house, that I shouldn\u2019t have offered to let him stay with me if I was just going to abandon him, and that I shouldn\u2019t have lied to him about where I was.\n\nI think I might be the AH because I lied about where I was, and because I left him by himself in my apartment all weekend knowing he had no car to get around. I also think I have the right to want some peace and quite and an actual bed after everything I went through the month prior.\nI am bringing it to you impartial people.

Shitty people have a desire to control the narrative in these situations because he's assumes you're going to tell people the truth. And he knows he looks bad with the truth because he is.

You outrank this guy yet you are allowing him to call the shots?

I have a suspicion that he is either lying to you or he\u2019s going to get in some kind of trouble for losing his key. Either way how is this your problem? He is a GUEST in your home that has outstayed his welcome. Furthermore, why are you taxiing him and his friend around? \n\nHe should be the one taking the floor or a hotel room and not bringing back strangers uninvited. Furthermore why are you letting this guy who you\u2019ve only known a couple of months stay alone in your home doing god knows what and letting complete strangers in? \n\nGet onto his commanding officer and get this resolved. Kick him out of your home and change your locks for good measure. You seem to have mentally checked out from dealing with this kind of this conflict for some unknown reason. YTA to yourself.

Shooting an enemy combatant and telling your awkward needy acquaintance that you are not besties are two very different skill sets.  \n\nThat said, your suggestion of counseling is a good one.  \n\nThing is, OP is a female, AH platoon-mate is gay, there is going to be a lot of pressure to prove they belong there (yes, in 2023).  She is making a sincere effort to be one of the team; he, on the other hand, has found an angle on this.  Which makes him doubly an AH for exploiting OP."]}
