His son Jory is 15 and his daughter Emily is 7. Jory's mom died weeks after Emily was born. My brother and Jory's mom were long since divorced and he primarily lived with her until her death. Jory went through a lot in a very short period of time. Jory's maternal family are a very present part of Jory's life. This was something my brother and his wife disapproved of but allowed because my parents and I told them it was not about them or Emily but about Jory and how he lost his mom.\n\nTheir attitude did not change and it did influence Emily somewhat, I believe. She adores Jory and is very jealous that he goes away for hours and sometimes overnight to be with his family. She's jealous that he's not someone who keeps photos but has one of his mom in his room, in a special frame. Mostly she's a little girl who wants her older (half) brother's attention. She thinks he's the greatest person in the world. But sometimes I feel like she hears too much of what her parents think.\n\nTwo months ago there was an incident at my brother's house. Jory didn't want to spend time with Emily and was reading a letter his mom wrote to him before she died. Emily pushed and was told to get out of his room. She was angry and from what I can piece together my brother and his wife did not talk her down. When Jory left the room Emily went inside and broke the frame and tore up the photo of Jory's mom. Jory walked in as she was still tearing the photo up.\n\nJory yelled at Emily and Emily cried and said was mad and wanted him to spend time with her but he picked a letter over her. My brother walks in and tells Jory to stop yelling at his sister and goes to console Emily. Both my brother and his wife decide it's not a big issue. Jory disagrees and they argue. Emily went back to Jory's room later and says she's sorry but Jory ignores her and she cried and said she just wanted him to not love his mom more. He told her he didn't love her and would always love his mom more and he would never forgive her for what she did, that he did not want her as his sister and she needed to get out of his room and not speak to him again.\n\nThings got intense between my brother and Jory and Jory left and went to stay with his maternal grandparents. My brother tried to stop him but his wife said she didn't want Jory around Emily if he was going to be so hateful.\n\nJory is still with his grandparents. My brother thought Jory would have \"seen sense\" and calmed down. I said he couldn't expect Jory to see it as a minor issue. My brother was like I couldn't seriously be blaming a 7 year old for acting out the way she did. I said no, I blamed him and his wife, that they are the parents and handled it all badly and likely fed into Emily's jealousy with their attitude that Jory shouldn't see his family. I said I hold them accountable for that and then for acting like Jory had no right to be mad.\n\nMy brother believes I'm the one who is wrong and being an ass to him and his wife.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694258845, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16e3cvf/aita_for_telling_my_brother_i_blame_him_and_his/", "score": 2641, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's not what grief is for kids, they don't fully understand death.

Graduations, first crushes, learning to drive, etc... For me it lasted into my 20s. \n\nYour brother and his family need counseling, desperately.

But she also told him she didn\u2019t want him to love his mom more than her. \n\nAnd yes. She is 7. She doesn\u2019t have a lot of context or understanding of why Jory\u2019s situation is different from hers, especially given that her parents seem to want Jory to forget about his mom. But there are some words and phrases that you can\u2019t unhear. They can permanently change the way you think about someone. \n\nIt\u2019s possible that as Jory grows up, he\u2019ll understand that those words were more his dad\u2019s fault than Emily\u2019s. But even then, I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s going to feel comfortable having the kind of close sibling relationship that she wants. \n\nThis is 10000% the parents fault, but the way they\u2019ve poisoned Emily and Jory\u2019s relationship may not be fixable now.", "Doesn\u2019t have to be forever, 3 years and he\u2019ll move out and never think about her very much because of the large age difference. At that point he will have little motivation to get close with her, she will mostly exist as bad memories, and I doubt the relationship will ever recover even though it won\u2019t be specifically about her actions as a 7 YO to him", "One incident, probably not, even if it hurt Jory quite a lot. The thing is, it sounds as though Emily has been encouraged in this behavior by both her parents and they both blame Jory for this incident, not her. Unless Emily learns from this in a way that apparently her parents are unwilling to, I doubt there'll be much of a relationship.", "I've seen people on here and out there in the world hold children in contempt for things that weren't even their fault, cheating mothers who blamed their child to deflect ownership of their own actions, faulty parents whose inattention led to a siblings injury blaming their barely older child for not doing anything, and middle children holding a grudge for their entire life that the \"baby of the family\" title was taken from them.\n\nAt least in this scenario the child is held in contempt for something they actually did, and knew was wrong at the time they did it. She might be seven, and her impulse control is very early development, but she knew what she was doing at the time was something she'd have to apologize for later, but in this case the teachable moment she acquired was that puppy dog eyes, tears, and an apology are sometimes not enough when you do something genuinely unforgiveable.", "Really: how is she handling 2nd grade if she really thought this was ok? She absolutely knew better and acted in the way most calculated to cause severe distress and hurt.

So, ofc he's gonna resent the sibling who was forced on him, the child of the woman who seems to want him to have no connections to his mother.\n\nThe parents failed both children horribly.

It does not sound like he attacks her in any way, he just wants to be left alone to do his own thing.", "No, the parents are still responsible for setting the atmosphere of the home, the attitude they present to the children, and punishment for misbehaving. The father and stepmother fully created this problem through their own jealousies and selfish views pushing the son to forget his mother and to not see his mother's family.", "Do you think she's destroying other people's belongings in school? Or shoving her way into other kids' classrooms? Or telling her classmates she thinks they should be her friends and not Amy's? Actually, the last may be plausible, that's absolutely bully behavior.\n\nSeven is absolutely old enough to understand you don't destroy other people's property, that you don't go into other people's private spaces without permission, and not everyone is going to want to spend time with you all the time. I think I learned all those things by the age of four (as did all of my cousins, I remember hearing through the door someone explain to my 3-year-old cousin that sometimes people want to do things alone and would she like to do something else). And she hurt her brother in ways that would be hard for ANYONE to forgive.\n\nSo no, 'she's seven' isn't an excuse.", "If she can handle being taught at school then she is old enough for her parents to teach common decency.

She may never be forgiven. It may be a circumstance that the best choice for her is therapy so she can learn how to deal with the loss.\n\nJory can't be forced to forgive her.

OP didn't say anything about any other events or incidents. Also if you are too dense to understand that \"just this\" is not minimizing the event in this context but staying that if it doesn't involve other events, idk what to tell you.

I also feel compelled to point out, that I do not and never would condone this behavior, but this is a parental issue, not an evil child issue and she clearly does not comprehend the ramifications of her actions because OP even pointed out that the brother is the sisters favorite person.", "Well yeah but she's still a child. She may understand what she did was wrong (emphasis on may) but if her parents don't punish or reprimand her for it and she's upset that her brother doesn't spend the time with her that she wants him to then she won't learn just how messed up what she did is. She's only 7, sure children are often smarter and more perceptive than we give them credit for but they're still children and can have tantrums and act horribly.

Jory at 15 has a lot going on just trying to cope with being a 15yr old boy, let alone his Mom dying and blending into a new family.

They missed the chance to teach her empathy.\r  \n\r  \nThe fact that your brother doesn't see how big of a deal it is that his daughter ripped up the photo of his son's deceased mother out of spite is just as disturbing as the fact that they for some reason have an issue with Jory spending time with his maternal family. Regardless if his mother was still alive or not they're still his family.\r  \n\r  \nWhat does your brother want to achieve by isolating his son from his other family just because his mother is gone? If your brother doesn't get it together he'll lose his son & I wouldn't blame Jory for cutting him off.\r  \n\r  \nHonestly, your nephew doesn't need to go back to that toxic household. Hopefully his grandparents can continue to raise him for good.", "I feel so badly for Jory. I\u2019m glad that his grandparents are in his corner. I hope that they can help him deal with the loss of his mom. Poor child. His sister sounds like she needs to be disciplined. \n\nPoor Jory, of course you are NOT the asshole, unfortunately your brother is.", "I'm glad the maternal family is still around because they likely have many copies of photos of Jory's mom. You hear stories like this every so often of people having their only remaining copy of photos of loved ones being destroyed and they are irreplaceable. Was very worried about that note the whole time I was reading.", "That\u2019s a teachable moment Emily should have learned 3 years ago.", "Dude why does emily not want her brother to love his mother more than her? That is so weird!\n\nI feel like some info is being left out as to the effects of the parenting. I've seen lots of posts here of being upset when their elder siblings don't want to  spend time with them and lashing out in jealousy but never because they love their mother more! She literally told him I don't want you to love your mother more than me. That seems like something a stepmother or a parent would feel not a 7 year old half sister.\n\nTo be clear I'm not saying Op is holding back and the parents are innocent but some of the particulers are weird so I'm curious as to how that developed it.s? Is it some weird jealousy thing? How exactly did his brother and wife cause his sister to lash out like this, lack of punishments and spoiling sure but are they why she is so obsessed with her brother or something? He was divorced from his ex long before she died and Jory lived with her predominantly before so it's not like he'd have a reason to mourn so badly he'd want to erase her to avoid the pain or something. Jealously seems likely but still it seems so weird even for that!\n\nTo be clear I'm not saying Op is holding back and the parents are innocent but some of the particular here are weird so I'm curious as to how that developed", " not only that, but it seems like they favor her. i wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she ended up being a total monster", "I was about the same age as the sister, when I destroyed a picture my older sister made. I knew that it was important to her and why. That's the reason I chose this picture. I was angry at her and wanted her to be sad. I completly understood my actions. Kids understand a lot more than you may think.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

She is only seven, and she learned all that from her parents. Hopefully when she's older she can apologize to Jory, he can find it in his heart to forgive her, and they can start a new sibling relationship. His father and stepmother though...that is probably ruined. And it sounds like good riddance.", "You think it\u2019s possible this is deliberate on the brother\u2019s end?", "I definitely think this is something Emily's parents are putting into her head, or at least the mum. \"Your brother loves his dead mom more than he loves you.\" She doesn't want Jory around.", "Sounds like kid is geniunely lucky to have both you and his grandparents the way you all are.", "And stepmother said if he was going to be \u2018hateful\u2019 aka angry and devastated that a treasured item was destroyed then it\u2019d be better if he did leave \ud83d\ude31", "Jesus.... your brother just sounds worse & worse. He shouldn't \"force\" a relationship but he could have encouraged a bond of some kind with his new family. Instead he gets jealous of the family that was there for Jory while he was mostly absent.", "I think that you are NTA and are actually the MVP of this whole situation because you confronted your brother with his shit.", "NTA and I truly hope you and your family help the maternal case for Jory to stay with them. I hope that could work out for the sake of this kid.", "Oh for sure\n\nTo be honest, in this case?! I hope she sways OP's brother's mind into letting Jory stay at his grandparents. Otherwise the next three years will be hell for him", "Do you think the stepmother goaded her daughter into doing that to get rid of him?", "The question of it is if the picture is replaceable. If the picture can be printed out again, if the frame can be repaired or replaced. Op describes the frame as special, but that could mean a lot of things. If it is replaceable, I think they might still have a relationship one day, but if it is irreplaceable, then the relationship is probably doomed.", "I don\u2019t think he will forgive her. He will always see this as disrespecting his mother. And no amount of growing up will change that.", "I think you are overly optimistic .  It would be very easy for an older half brother living with a family that did not recognize the hurt the half sister inflicted to never trust or feel close to his half sister.  An 8 year age difference, especially between half sibling of different genders , tended to prevent relationships from being built.    \nEvery time he looks at her he will see her deliberately destroying s treasured memo of hosts mother.  Every time he hears her voice he will remember her saying she wants to be loved more than his mother.  kt", "I don't think this was a one off. I think it was the coup de grace. I think it's over between Jory & Emily. I think it's over between Jory & dad. I think stepmother is perfectly fine with it. I just hope OP & his parents can salvage their relationship with Jory.", "I think she destroyed the relationship. Some things are unforgivable even from a seven year old. \n\nPlus this seems like an ongoing issue with her.", "i think its completely deliberate & gaslighting the child into thinking THEY are wrong when clearly it is him & his wifes hangups", "Honestly yeah. I don\u2019t get along with my sister who\u2019s 2 years older than me and sometimes my brother who\u2019s 2 years younger but I get along great with my older brother who\u2019s around 7 years older lmao", "Seriously? Like yeah she did something awful, but NEVER? She\u2019s a kid. I\u2019ve forgiven ADULTS for a lot worse, would you really trash any chance of a relationship with a family member due to them being an asshole as age 7????", "100% This isnt something Jory should need to forgive. He may get past it, but forgiveness is not mandatory.", "You are not required to love your family, especially when they treat you poorly. He was 8 when his mom died and was likely forced to have a relationship with his half sister. I think OP is correct in that it's the parents who created the situation and I don't think any of this makes Emily a bad person, but you seem to be solely focused on her emotions just like the parents. Jory is allowed to be upset, he's allowed to not love his sister, he does not owe it to her especially since the relationship is so clearly broken by the parents' behavior.", "> She is 7 years old for goodness sakes!\n\nThat\u2019s old enough to learn that there are some things that an apology won\u2019t fix, and more than old enough to learn that tears won\u2019t get her her own way.", "So? That doesn\u2019t mean Jory is obligated to coddle her.", "Dad should look into a good photo restoration service that could provide Jory with a physical copy and digital backups. It won't feel the same and won't magically fix the harm that was done, but it's a small olive branch.", "My ex and I have 20+ years of digital pictures of us and our kids. So your point is totally valid.", "Oh agreed \ud83d\udcaf on the gaslighting.  I meant that it didn\u2019t hit me before that maybe they intentionally want to destroy memories of his mother.  I thought they were just coddling Emily too much because of usual parent \u201csecond child\u201d bias", "She's only 7, and he's only 15. That's still a child, dealing with some difficult shit. Don't judge him like an adult with adult perspective.", "Yes. And fully old enough to know NOT to steal, NOT to destroy other's property, and NOT to demand 100% attention. She is the age of second graders FFS.", "She is a seven year old who knew exactly how to hurt her brother the worst way.", "Hopefully for Jory, they will", "That too! They coddle Emily to the point where she is now showing that \u201cmy mom is your mom\u201d behavior and expects him to get over the loss of his own mother. Its only going to get worse and Jory is blessed to have his mothers family and OP.", "No. He didnt tell her horrible things. He told her the truth. She didnt like it.", "He did not tell her horrible things. People will not all love her no matter how she behaves.", "If my 7 year old was such a pathetic jealous destructive vengeful brat? 100% she deserved what he said. And no, I wouldnt have a problem with him being around her. She is reaping the consequences of her actions.", "Hell no. She needs discipline in the long term and harsh punishment in the short term.", "Even if they don't his dad's wife is fine with it so dad won't argue; they should send both the SS survivor benefits assuming this is US and child support for him.", "All of this, and she needs the simple, direct message (b/c 7 year olds are simple, direct people): Being mean to people won't make them love you more. Trying to force them to love you more by getting mad and doing mean stuff won't make them love you more, and it might make them leave.", "He clearly has mistreated her for a while for her to react like that, and in fact he did tell a seven year old horrible things.", "The 15 is way older than emily. Emily is 7 and clearly portraying that she has been treated very poorly by the 15 year old. The poor little kid is acting out because of her mistreatment. He is twice her age. He should know better.", "And that does not justify treating a child - your sibling - poorly your entire life.", "You completely ignored their question.", "An apology isn\u2019t a get-out-of-jail-free card. And, an apology doesn\u2019t change the actions of a child old enough to know better. The reaction from the parents (or, really, lack thereof) is just the icing on the shitparent cake.", "I am betting this is a pattern. 7 yearmld is an aeful little brat, but she said sorry so Jory has the be ok with it. And hell yes itnwas permanany damagr. Destroying treasured possessions is ABUSE. And abuse? Is permanant damage.", "The parents should have taught both kids compassion and respect for each other and when they realized brother was mistreating and cold to sister, should have stuck him in therapy. They should not have let him abuse his sister. And OP should have stood up for the mistreated sister as well.", "Awwww. You're one of those contrarians who think blame is equivalent on both sides.\n\nI remember being as immature and misguided as you are. When I was 7."]}
