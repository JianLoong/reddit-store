Ya'll definitely need family therapy on top of individual therapy.", "NTA. You\u2019re a minor and your parents should figure out how to treat you right. You literally gave him all the answers and they are still just not listening. I would say though, from now on, you\u2019re probably going to have to pick your battles until you\u2019re old enough and able to move out. It sounds like you have a lot of experience avoiding his bad temper, I wouldn\u2019t expect it to change too much.", "NTA - it's got to hurt that he could never bother to do the right thing for you, but for the \"new kid\" suddenly it's worth the effort.  He's spent a lot of years putting you through hard times with his issues; he doesn't get a free pass and suddenly everything is great because supposedly he is finally addressing the issue.  If he wants a relationship with you, he needs to put in the work and earn it.  You don't have to feel happy about anything.  If he finally gets his crap together, it's still your right to decide whether or not to have a relationship with him.  He's the one who screwed things up.", "NTA\n\nBut if you aren't already I think you should look into talking to a therapist.  It seems like you've got a lot of feelings about your dad and this whole situation.  It could cause problems if you ignore it.", "NTA. You're just a kid yourself, dealing with a lot of emotions and anger that is justifiable. Your parents should figure out how to treat you right.", "NTA.  And there's something really weird about him jumping through hoops for \"the new kid\" when he couldn't be arsed for the 4 he has been raising since birth. And it doesn't seem fair that she should get her own bedroom and force you to share all of a sudden.", "NTA, you were already forced to change your room which is ridiculous then made to feel like this other kid is more important. Good for you for standing up for yourself", "NTA. You\u2019re angry, a lot of suppressed emotions here. You\u2019re allowed to you know, feel and express those emotions. Your father is the AH for not listening all those years but he\u2019s at least trying now.", "NTA. However, any improvements made are a good thing for your siblings. You may change your mind at some point to have a relationship with him, or not. He has damaged the relationship, not you. Give it time and see how you feel.", "NTA.  This is a complex situation and I highly recommend talking to a therapist if it's possible.  My brother and a couple friends had some similar experiences and it's really something you want to work through for your own sake.", "NTA\n\nCan I just ask when did your dad found out about his kid. Because it sounds like he found this out not so long ago and already he's doing this for the kid whom he met not so long ago... rather than you whom he knows you since you were a baby.\n\nI would be mad too if I asked my dad to do something about his temper and then he tells me that he's doing this for someone else (someone he doesn't even knows that long).\n\nAnd about your room I guess your dad was trying to make up for lost time somehow. Or maybe he thought it would be awkward if your half sister had to share a room with someone she just met (I would ask about a reason so I could know for sure).\n\nOf course it's not the \"new kid's\" fault. So I suggest if you weren't treated badly by your half sister that you don't hate her for things your dad said. But you absolutely have the right to be angry. I do think that it's great that your dad is trying to get some help and I hope the best for you. I truly hope his anger issues get solved. You decide if you will give them a chance or not.", "NTA, he still doesnt get the point and is doimg stuff specifically for the new kid. \nDont hate your sister though, she isnt to blame for your fathers mistakes. Hopefully he realizes his mistakes in his therapy sessions", "NTA - Your feelings are perfectly valid. Yeah, him working on himself is a good thing but you can be as angry as you need to be for the blatant favoritism that he is showing. I would definitely feel the same way you are right now. He is not only ruining his relationship with you but also the relationship that you could have had with your half sister. I agree with others that therapy can help you work through your feelings constructively. We all need a bit of therapy every so often.", "I would say NTA\u2026 he had the opportunity to do that awhile ago\u2026 however I want to say some times people get a new perspective as life goes on and things change.. I would at least give your dad the chance to change and work on his behavior. i am not saying you have to be all buddy buddy with him, but if you wish to have a relationship with him much into your adult years, then please give him the chance\u2026 also make sure to communicate to him as to why this has hurt you ( you have every right to feel the way you do) , if you need to take a step back from him while you process these emotions, then do so\u2026\n\nPerhaps you could attend a therapy session with him at some point", "NTA\nYou are not wrong for being unhappy. \nYour dad is handling this very badly, so he gets TA label. Hopefully he follows through with the therapy and figures that out. \n\nYou should stop calling them \"the new kid\". They are first born and could justifiably see you and your siblings as dad's new kids. That this kid has suddenly been plopped into your dad's custody(given the complete lack of history) = trauma. Your dad might be going to state mandated therapy. Which is not actually something to be angry about, imo", "NTA", "NTA. Tell your prick of a dad to do one.", "NTA you have the right to express these emotions, but you have to keep in mind that your father is the problem not the kid", "NTA because you are  a child who is processing a very emotional situation. You father has been abusive not physically but emotionally. Your life have been rocked by the discovery of a sister which has resulted in a lot of change for your family as well as her. Dad has acknowledged he has an issue and is seeking help, which is a good thing. He reached out to you to try and explain this and did it the wrong way \n\nYou need to talk with your dad calmly and explain your feelings. He is so focused in his new kid that he probably doesn't even realise he  has made everything about her and how the change has effected you . you may wish to ask for a session with him and a therapist to allow you to explain why you are hurt and angry", "NTA. He's a huge asshole for expecting the kid he emotionally abused for a decade to be excited he's trying not to abuse her new sibling. His therapist needs to give him a reality check.", "I can see where you are coming from and it's totally understandable you feel that way, so I wouldn't say it was a AH move.\n\nHowever, the situation is quite tricky. The new kid has nothing to do with this tbh, she's the one who lived 15 years without a father. For your father this must be quite a difficult situation, may have caused him guilt or some other feelings and that maybe was the \"last drop\" he needed to seek therapy, because as you said, he seemed really resistant to do so.\n\nI totally understand giving the new kid a room for herself \u2014 she doesn't know you guys yet, she doesn't have intimacy with the other kids, so putting myself in her shoes I'd be totally uncomfortable in this situation.\n\nOther than that, you sound jealous of how your dads behaving because of the recently discovered kid, which is quite understandable because it must be a difficult situation for you as well, especially because until now you were the oldest daughter and you lost your room, i mean, it's a major change in events overall and house dynamics.. \n\nBut keep in mind the vast majority of people, especially resistant ones, don't seek therapy because they feel they could be better for their loved ones by working on their issues, people usually only seek it when they can't deal with a problem on their own and are hurting/stressing out. The good side is, if the therapist is good, your father will end up working on the issues he has with you as well. Give it time, because it's just like you got yourself a new member in the family, it's normal to the parents to be focused on the new member, happens when our siblings are born as well. The fact that she's already 15yo and her own father didn't know about her adds to this situation.\n\nAnyway, i hope you feel better soon, Op. Hang in there. Nobody can take your place away from you.", "NAH.  I understand your frustration and anger over your dad's past behavior, but sometimes it takes a major shock to our system to snap us out of our bad habits.  That's what this new kid was to your dad.  He's acknowledged that he's been a bad dad, and he's hoping to do better going forward.  Your mom is right that you should work through your anger and try giving your dad another chance, given that he's trying to mend the bridge with you.  I don't blame you for reacting angrily, but consider forgiving your dad at some point.  Also, cut your sister some slack.  You seem to be jealous of her, but don't forget that she didn't even have a dad at all for 15 years.  If anything, she should be jealous of you.", "NAH.\n\nHe's trying to improve himself - he's been an AH, obviously, but making an effort to stop is not a bad thing. \n\nYou're fully justified in being upset with him for the way he's been.\n\nYou're a little out of line for pretending to know his motivations for seeking help at this point - yes, the newly discovered child obviously contributed to his decision to do it now, but to say it's \"only\" because of her is pretty short-sighted. He clearly is doing it for you, too, which is why he wanted to talk to you face to face.  That doesn't mean you should forget all your frustrations with him or instantly forgive the past - like I said, you're justified in feeling how you feel - but you should not be upset with him because he's trying to be a better parent, period.", "This isn\u2019t really as clear cut as you\u2019re wanting it to be. Your dad sucks at parenting. To a degree all parents suck at parenting somehow. It\u2019s good he\u2019s going to try and get better, but the motivation and timing sucks.\n\nResponding out of hurt doesn\u2019t make YTA. Family sucks. You can try to make it work with him, and might benefit from some counsel too. Or you can hold it in and be angry and cut him off.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Occasionally the courts would force me to visit but I tried really hard to be as unpleasant as possible so he wouldn't ask the courts to order me to visit anymore. It eventually worked and I haven't seen him in nearly 30 years and I don't regret it at all.\n\nFor some reason adults tend to think that teenagers don't know their own minds.

It\u2019s very positive that your Dad is taking the steps he is, doing such things are not always easy. Your feelings are valid I would be mad too, but staying angry will only hurt you on the end. It\u2019s hard, especially at 14, to put yourself in another\u2019s shoes but it is an important thing to do. It sounds like you have some unresolved issues with your new sibling, remember that none of this is her fault or yours.

But OP has a right to resent the new kid, and no obligation to like her or be around her. I personally wouldn\u2019t like someone if they got all the love, affection, and good parenting from my father that I never got. The new kid is not to blame, but OP is valid for resenting her. It isn\u2019t fair and it\u2019s hard to be a kid and have to compete for your parents\u2019 love.

That he would change for his eldest child (she's not  justhis new kid- she's going through something too and you don't have to like or love her, but you should at least respect that) doesn't mean he loves her more, it means he's most insecure about his relationship with her. It isn't a comparison- he should have worked on his temper for you. He failed you. And you're absolutely entitled to be angry at him for that.

You are NTA at all for being upset by his phrasing. However, I think that from his perspective, you and your full siblings were always in his life and he had no motivation to change because he thought you love him enough as he was. Yes, this is crappy in and of itself. But with the new kid he realizes he needs to earn the things he took for granted from you, which was love and respect, and that he couldn't do it as he is currently.

At 15, you seem to be articulate, bright, and observant. Maybe that's why you two butted heads the most - you didn't want to lie down and let him run you over.

I am glad that your mother seems to be listening to you. You might consider speaking to your mother about therapy for you and once you feel that you are in a good place, start addressing things directly with him.\n\nAt 15 neither of my parents would listen to me. It was horrible. I ran away from home at one point, and instead of that being their wake up call, they doubled down. If either of them just let me switch schools or at least put me in therapy, my entire life would be different. It's not too late for you, though.", "NTA I am glad he is getting help, but part of that needs to be realizing that he has hurt you in the past and it seems like he has not acknowledged that. Plus therapy ISNT a guarantee. You are under no obligation to be a Guinea pig to test if he is finally at the point where he will stop hurting you. You can just do what w did and tell\nHim to fuck right off with that nonsense. \nI say this as a dad who grew up with a shitty dad", "NTA.

No,I don't blame you for being upset.", "NTA.\n\nIf you're comfortable though, you should try to tell your dad why that was painful, so he can add it to his list of stuff to work on in therapy, especially if your younger siblings are still in the household. \n\nHe needs to understand how cruel it was to essentially say to his four children he's always had that they weren't worth changing for.", "NTA", "ESH...him for only doing it for the new kid (who is actually older than you, but whatever)...you (slightly) for the way you said it.  I get it, you're a teen and it's super hard to keep the emotions in check in heated moments, it happens and the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.  My 2 cents?  Apologize for the language in the heat of the moment but not for how he made you feel.  Maybe ask if you can be a part of his therapy so that at the very least you know he's actually making progress (for your siblings' sake as well as your own).", "Hmmm... this is like the character from the good place.

Her appearing was probably a major shock for him and with her being so vulnerable he felt the need to focus on her.  Yeah, he should have been more mindful of his other children but humans are flawed.  \n\nAs for the having her own room, if she's come from foster care chances are she had her own room.

You losing your temper and yelling at someone, especially after this level of stress, is a thing that happens. Obviously I don't think you should've acted that way, but I don't know what he was expecting.\n\nYour dad is a grown man, and I hold him to a MUCH higher standard.

But I need to make up for new kids and 15y of absence is worse than 14y of psychological abuse\".\nDunno if it's considered an abuse thought. You're judge.\n\nNTA", "Info: did you ask him what he meant?\n\nIt could be his other child causing this rift, and him not handling it well - she pointed out he\u2019s in the wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s easier hearing things from someone new. But the impact is still that he would be able to be a better parent to you - he felt that was important and shared it with you probably because his intention is to make amends with you.\n\nYour other siblings (incl. The new one) will also benefit from this. Each of you will inspire different changes and things in your parents and others. This does not take away from how much it matters with respect to you and his intention to do right by you.\n\nYes it sucks he didn\u2019t listen before. I\u2019d still find out more how this came about. even if it was simply not to recreate the issues he created with you with your new sister, it means he\u2019s learned from his mistakes with you - and came back to acknowledge and amend that. People learn in different slow and twisted paths, I\u2019d just not want you to lose out on the outcomes you\u2019d always wanted cause how it came about. You\u2019re 14, not 34, it\u2019s still a lot of time you have with a good father during your high school years.\n\nDo you talk to new sis? It maybe she\u2019s not too bad, and you have a new ally. Given this twist\u2026maybe she doesn\u2019t like that things are this way and wants to help. \n\nOlder siblings can be cool, but I can definitely tell you - oldest siblings are not good at yielding that seat and control. No matter how old y\u2019all get (I have older sibs, and friends who are oldest sibs). It makes sense you\u2019d struggle most with this new person you\u2019re meant to call sister, but please know (as a younger sibling) that older sibling can take a huge load off you and offer an ally. Life being oldest and always in control is tiring, and often they don\u2019t learn to let others help them. Anyway - Regardless of your father, sounds like you and him wouldn\u2019t have been able to take the pressure of a new sibling together based on difficult interactions before\u2026think of the dynamic and it\u2019s affect on you. This isn\u2019t your sisters fault or yours. And it is good he\u2019s seeing that he needs to do the work as a parent. \n\nAnyway I totally hear and feel your frustration, NTA", "NTA, I am with you. Fuck him, he is an asshole.", "NTA. he could\u2019ve just said \u201ci just want to be a better person\u201d or \u201ci just wanna be a better dad to all of you.\u201d Why the need to particularly say that it was for the new kid. Favoritism always gets me riled up.", "NTA classic case of \u201cI can change, I just don\u2019t see you as worthy enough for me to change\u201d", "NTA for being angry with your Dad. I bet that the new kid was like, \u201cWTF is wrong with you?\u201d and your Dad paid attention because an \u201coutsider\u201d pointed out his poor behaviour. \n\nSometimes when our close family tell us things, we dismiss them because they are close family. We think that they are complaining or nagging or whatever. It\u2019s only when an outsider notices the problem that we start to think that maybe there is something to work on after all if an outsider can see it.\n\nI guess I am trying to say that sometimes it takes an outsider for us to realize how bad our behaviour has spiralled.", "yes, he is triying to change thats a good thing even if is not because you \n\nThe world doenst revolve around you\n\nyou dont need to like your new sister nor you dad, but you need to live with them, dont let his verbal abuse going unnoticed if he does again, and try to be kind to your new sister who has gone throught some shit herself", "NTA op you have every right to mourn the father you could have had, your reaction was an expression of grieve towards another life and another father, something that his other child is having now, and nobody can tell you how to feel about your grieve", "Agree with this.\n\nNTA.", "I cry every time I watch that scene.\n\nI was the child not worth changing for.\n\nIt sucks seeing someone else get everything you ever wanted.", "Sounds like the courts should remove all the kids from his custody tbh.", "Oh dude, I'm sorry for your situation.\n\nIs it possible for you to live with your mom long term?\n\n18 and freedom from family is not far for you. You are NTA \n\nHugs.", "Nta too little too late", "If she came from foster care, dad getting $ for child and probably some guidelines and requirements. It may not be the new kid, but the $ that's his motivator.", "NTA my dad was the same way went out of his way for others couldn't give a rats behind about the kid that was there the whole time. You're gonna be okay kid believe me", "Nope, NTA. You had to deal with his temper all these years, if he has something to say, tell him to go have a fucking cry to his therapist, at least they get paid to care. He hasn't *actually* done *anything* to deal with the pain he's caused you, and he sure as fuck isn't doing it *for* you. He broke it, about time he pulled his head out of his ass and fixed it and you are *not* obligated to make it easy for him.", "NTA", "NTA you have every right. He didn\u2019t wanna change for his other kids and NOW he\u2019s wanting to? It\u2019s obvious he\u2019s shown who really matters to him", "Thank you for introducing me to the perfect quote to sum up my relationship, (lack of), with my own father!", "Ouch well this hurt.", "This was my entire life until I was 50 and finally found my one night stand sperm doner via  dna. Turns out that mine wasn't a suburban dad he was in jail for 10 years for murder and my life was better with no dad than him.", "She was in foster care, not living with her other parent.", "The dad only found out about her a few months ago.\n\nWouldn\u2019t you bring your child you just found out about into your home if you found out they were in foster care? That seems like a very natural reaction to me."]}
