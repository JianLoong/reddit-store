Ya'll definitely need family therapy on top of individual therapy.", "NTA. You\u2019re a minor and your parents should figure out how to treat you right. You literally gave him all the answers and they are still just not listening. I would say though, from now on, you\u2019re probably going to have to pick your battles until you\u2019re old enough and able to move out. It sounds like you have a lot of experience avoiding his bad temper, I wouldn\u2019t expect it to change too much.", "NTA - it's got to hurt that he could never bother to do the right thing for you, but for the \"new kid\" suddenly it's worth the effort.  He's spent a lot of years putting you through hard times with his issues; he doesn't get a free pass and suddenly everything is great because supposedly he is finally addressing the issue.  If he wants a relationship with you, he needs to put in the work and earn it.  You don't have to feel happy about anything.  If he finally gets his crap together, it's still your right to decide whether or not to have a relationship with him.  He's the one who screwed things up.", "NTA\n\nBut if you aren't already I think you should look into talking to a therapist.  It seems like you've got a lot of feelings about your dad and this whole situation.  It could cause problems if you ignore it.", "NTA. You're just a kid yourself, dealing with a lot of emotions and anger that is justifiable. Your parents should figure out how to treat you right.", "NTA.  And there's something really weird about him jumping through hoops for \"the new kid\" when he couldn't be arsed for the 4 he has been raising since birth. And it doesn't seem fair that she should get her own bedroom and force you to share all of a sudden.", "NTA, you were already forced to change your room which is ridiculous then made to feel like this other kid is more important. Good for you for standing up for yourself", "NTA. You\u2019re angry, a lot of suppressed emotions here. You\u2019re allowed to you know, feel and express those emotions. Your father is the AH for not listening all those years but he\u2019s at least trying now.", "NTA. However, any improvements made are a good thing for your siblings. You may change your mind at some point to have a relationship with him, or not. He has damaged the relationship, not you. Give it time and see how you feel.", "NTA.  This is a complex situation and I highly recommend talking to a therapist if it's possible.  My brother and a couple friends had some similar experiences and it's really something you want to work through for your own sake.", "NTA\n\nCan I just ask when did your dad found out about his kid. Because it sounds like he found this out not so long ago and already he's doing this for the kid whom he met not so long ago... rather than you whom he knows you since you were a baby.\n\nI would be mad too if I asked my dad to do something about his temper and then he tells me that he's doing this for someone else (someone he doesn't even knows that long).\n\nAnd about your room I guess your dad was trying to make up for lost time somehow. Or maybe he thought it would be awkward if your half sister had to share a room with someone she just met (I would ask about a reason so I could know for sure).\n\nOf course it's not the \"new kid's\" fault. So I suggest if you weren't treated badly by your half sister that you don't hate her for things your dad said. But you absolutely have the right to be angry. I do think that it's great that your dad is trying to get some help and I hope the best for you. I truly hope his anger issues get solved. You decide if you will give them a chance or not.", "NTA, he still doesnt get the point and is doimg stuff specifically for the new kid. \nDont hate your sister though, he isnt to blame for your fathers mistakes. Hopefully he realizes his mistakes in his therapy sessions", "NTA - Your feelings are perfectly valid. Yeah, him working on himself is a good thing but you can be as angry as you need to be for the blatant favoritism that he is showing. I would definitely feel the same way you are right now. He is not only ruining his relationship with you but also the relationship that you could have had with your half sister. I agree with others that therapy can help you work through your feelings constructively. We all need a bit of therapy every so often.", "I would say NTA\u2026 he had the opportunity to do that awhile ago\u2026 however I want to say some times people get a new perspective as life goes on and things change.. I would at least give your dad the chance to change and work on his behavior. i am not saying you have to be all buddy buddy with him, but if you wish to have a relationship with him much into your adult years, then please give him the chance\u2026 also make sure to communicate to him as to why this has hurt you ( you have every right to feel the way you do) , if you need to take a step back from him while you process these emotions, then do so\u2026\n\nPerhaps you could attend a therapy session with him at some point", "NTA\nYou are not wrong for being unhappy. \nYour dad is handling this very badly, so he gets TA label. Hopefully he follows through with the therapy and figures that out. \n\nYou should stop calling them \"the new kid\". They are first born and could justifiably see you and your siblings as dad's new kids. That this kid has suddenly been plopped into your dad's custody(given the complete lack of history) = trauma. Your dad might be going to state mandated therapy. Which is not actually something to be angry about, imo", "NTA", "NTA. Tell your prick of a dad to do one.", "NTA you have the right to express these emotions, but you have to keep in mind that your father is the problem not the kid", "NTA because you are  a child who is processing a very emotional situation. You father has been abusive not physically but emotionally. Your life have been rocked by the discovery of a sister which has resulted in a lot of change for your family as well as her. Dad has acknowledged he has an issue and is seeking help, which is a good thing. He reached out to you to try and explain this and did it the wrong way \n\nYou need to talk with your dad calmly and explain your feelings. He is so focused in his new kid that he probably doesn't even realise he  has made everything about her and how the change has effected you . you may wish to ask for a session with him and a therapist to allow you to explain why you are hurt and angry", "NTA. He's a huge asshole for expecting the kid he emotionally abused for a decade to be excited he's trying not to abuse her new sibling. His therapist needs to give him a reality check.", "I can see where you are coming from and it's totally understandable you feel that way, so I wouldn't say it was a AH move.\n\nHowever, the situation is quite tricky. The new kid has nothing to do with this tbh, she's the one who lived 15 years without a father. For your father this must be quite a difficult situation, may have caused him guilt or some other feelings and that maybe was the \"last drop\" he needed to seek therapy, because as you said, he seemed really resistant to do so.\n\nI totally understand giving the new kid a room for herself \u2014 she doesn't know you guys yet, she doesn't have intimacy with the other kids, so putting myself in her shoes I'd be totally uncomfortable in this situation.\n\nOther than that, you sound jealous of how your dads behaving because of the recently discovered kid, which is quite understandable because it must be a difficult situation for you as well, especially because until now you were the oldest daughter and you lost your room, i mean, it's a major change in events overall and house dynamics.. \n\nBut keep in mind the vast majority of people, especially resistant ones, don't seek therapy because they feel they could be better for their loved ones by working on their issues, people usually only seek it when they can't deal with a problem on their own and are hurting/stressing out. The good side is, if the therapist is good, your father will end up working on the issues he has with you as well. Give it time, because it's just like you got yourself a new member in the family, it's normal to the parents to be focused on the new member, happens when our siblings are born as well. The fact that she's already 15yo and her own father didn't know about her adds to this situation.\n\nAnyway, i hope you feel better soon, Op. Hang in there. Nobody can take your place away from you.", "NAH.  I understand your frustration and anger over your dad's past behavior, but sometimes it takes a major shock to our system to snap us out of our bad habits.  That's what this new kid was to your dad.  He's acknowledged that he's been a bad dad, and he's hoping to do better going forward.  Your mom is right that you should work through your anger and try giving your dad another chance, given that he's trying to mend the bridge with you.  I don't blame you for reacting angrily, but consider forgiving your dad at some point.  Also, cut your sister some slack.  You seem to be jealous of her, but don't forget that she didn't even have a dad at all for 15 years.  If anything, she should be jealous of you.", "NAH.\n\nHe's trying to improve himself - he's been an AH, obviously, but making an effort to stop is not a bad thing. \n\nYou're fully justified in being upset with him for the way he's been.\n\nYou're a little out of line for pretending to know his motivations for seeking help at this point - yes, the newly discovered child obviously contributed to his decision to do it now, but to say it's \"only\" because of her is pretty short-sighted. He clearly is doing it for you, too, which is why he wanted to talk to you face to face.  That doesn't mean you should forget all your frustrations with him or instantly forgive the past - like I said, you're justified in feeling how you feel - but you should not be upset with him because he's trying to be a better parent, period.", "This isn\u2019t really as clear cut as you\u2019re wanting it to be. Your dad sucks at parenting. To a degree all parents suck at parenting somehow. It\u2019s good he\u2019s going to try and get better, but the motivation and timing sucks.\n\nResponding out of hurt doesn\u2019t make YTA. Family sucks. You can try to make it work with him, and might benefit from some counsel too. Or you can hold it in and be angry and cut him off.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I was in a similar situation, but my abusive father started dating a new woman before divorce was final and would act like a perfect father around her 5 yr old. It turned my stomach. I was 13 and said I never wanted to see him again. Occasionally the courts would force me to visit but I tried really hard to be as unpleasant as possible so he wouldn't ask the courts to order me to visit anymore. It eventually worked and I haven't seen him in nearly 30 years and I don't regret it at all.\n\nFor some reason adults tend to think that teenagers don't know their own minds. You know what you want/need from him and if he can't give it willingly FOR YOUR SAKE, then you should be free to determine the bounds of that relationship.

Some people do not have the emotional tools to handle the stress in a healthy way. As has been said in previous comments sometimes it takes a big shock to realize how bad your behaviour has been. It\u2019s very positive that your Dad is taking the steps he is, doing such things are not always easy. Your feelings are valid I would be mad too, but staying angry will only hurt you on the end. It\u2019s hard, especially at 14, to put yourself in another\u2019s shoes but it is an important thing to do. It sounds like you have some unresolved issues with your new sibling, remember that none of this is her fault or yours. In time after your initial anger has faded I would try talking with your Dad again about how you feel, and try to leave the anger out of it as anger is usually always a secondary emotion to something else you are feeling.

It's won't be that he likes her more than you, it's probably more that she made it clear what an AH he was being, and she said it in a different way.
