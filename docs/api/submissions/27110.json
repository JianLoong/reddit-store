{"id": 27110, "submission_id": "16lqhmp", "title": "AITA for turning down my stepdad's offer to walk me down the aisle?", "selftext": "I (27f) have chosen to walk down the aisle alone on my wedding day. The decision was made for two reasons. My dad died when I was 7 and he would be my number one choice if he were alive but he's not and two, my mom has made it perfectly clear that she would find it disrespectful to my stepdad if she walked me down the aisle and so would not do it. Given that both my parents are out and I don't want to ask my paternal grandparents to do too much, my grandma and I are already sharing a special dance, walking alone is what I feel the most comfortable doing.\n\nI could ask my stepdad and even when I contemplated my decision, I knew he would want to do it. But it would make me sad to have him walk me instead of my dad if I'm honest. I think my stepdad is a good man and he has tried his very best to be a dad for me. But I didn't want a dad when I lost mine. I wanted my dad. Nobody else was ever going to be able to fill that role in my heart.\n\nI asked my mom and stepdad if they would like to do a joint toast or two separate ones and whether they would like to walk down the aisle/dance to specific songs. While discussing this my stepdad asked who I would be walking with and I told him I was walking alone. He offered to do it and I said it was a lovely offer but I would walk alone. He pressed me on why and I said it felt like the best option. He said it would mean the world to him if he could do it, if just once he could feel like he's a real dad and not just second place to my dad. I told him I understood but it was not an option on the table.\n\nHe said he was already being shamed by having to watch me dance with my grandma when it should be a father/daughter dance. But to have everyone watch me walk alone when they know I have a stepdad is going to send a very big message. \n\nI know people will ask about details on our relationship, etc. I met my stepdad when I was 9 and he married my mom when I was 10. He offered to adopt me and give me his last name and I turned him down five times in the 8 years I lived with them. He was married before my mom and he lost his wife and unborn baby in an accident. He was also made sterile by the same accident. He always longed to be a dad. We got along well but our relationship was always more to him than it was to me. Where he sees a daughter and wants a daughter, I see a good man and someone who is a great spouse to my mom and is good to me, but does not fill the father role he wants to emotionally for me. Physically, he did. But emotionally I never felt like he was my dad and everyone in our lives is aware that I feel as though I have one dad and my stepdad is my stepdad.\n\nMy mom and stepdad are not paying or contributing to the wedding in any way. My fianc\u00e9 and I both have savings and we're putting those into the wedding. Though our wedding will be smallish since we want to prioritize other things.\n\nMy mom and stepdad say I am rude and heartless for turning down the offer.

Number one is he wants to do this badly and he's a good man so there's nothing wrong with him that would be a reason to say no. The other thing is I know this is just another rejection in his eyes and while it is a rejection of him as being \"my dad\" I know that will hurt him greatly.

While I can definitely sympathize with him, he is making your wedding about himself. He may be a good man, but he's definitely very selfish in this particular case. Stand your ground, it is your wedding. Your dad must have been amazing and I am sure he'll want you to be happy on that day (and every other day).", "Being a stepparent is truly a thankless job.  You're NTA but I really feel for your step-dad.", "NAH \n\nCan you do anything to acknowledge your stepdad at the wedding? A special dance, a toast, have him read a poem? I don\u2019t know but something to acknowledge his role in your life for years and that he tried his best?", "NTA - one thing my wife and I learned from our wedding is that no one should feel pressured to do anything or invite anyone they don't want to your wedding (especially since you are footing the bill). It sounds like atepdad is a little disappointed, and I know your mother is upset, but newsflash it isn't their wedding it's your wedding and your day. Maybe explain to stepdad that you think he is a good man, good husband etc. but you are walking alone as a way to honor your father? Or say fuck it and just tell them that's how it's going to be. To reiterate don't let anyone pressure or bully you, it's your day and weddings and planning don't need extra stress and b.s. added on to it.", "NAH but this post I will be honest shows once again why step parents don\u2019t like to invest emotionally in stepchildren.", "NTA - I was in a similar boat when I was younger. I don't have a good relationship with my biological father, but my stepfather is a wonderful man. \nWhen him and my mother married they gave me the option to take his last name (I currently have my mother's last name). I said I needed time to think. He took me aside afterwards and told me, \"no matter what name you want, I will always be there for you if you need me.\" \nIt has been nearly twenty years since they married, this father's day was the first I ever rang him unprompted to say thank you and that I had caught the Pokemon he wanted in the newest game that he couldn't catch so we could trade. \nIt took us more than two decades for him to take the role of father in my heart. And not once did he ever try to pressure me into it. \nI empathize with the feeling of no one being able to ever fill the role of father. Our circumstances differ in that mine understood the patience needed to overcome that barrier. \nI heard him cry for the first time on that call. Not only because for the first time I reached out to him, but also because he has never felt the connection to his own father to do that also. \nIt is obvious yours also harbours some pain. But you are not the arsehole, and no one has the right to make you feel so. I hope you have a wonderful wedding day, and as you walk down that aisle know how strong you are.", "What does it mean that he physically filled his role as stepfather but not emotionally?", "NTA. But i feel really sorry for your stepdad", "NTA.  Honestly I get both sides.  He has tried to be the dad and sounds like the emotional connection never happened.  That being said, I see why he would be sad and hurt that he is being absolutely excluded.  I almost want to say can you throw him a bone and do a separate dance with him, I do feel bad for someone who has tried so hard.\n\nEdit:  NAH.", "NAH You can choose to have your wedding whichever way you are comfortable. But as a parent I can understand why he would be upset. I think most people severely underestimate how much their parents have done for them until they parent themselves. It must hurt to know that the child you would die for doesn\u2019t really care too much.", "I feel a bit torn. You say he\u2019s a nice man and he filled the role physically. I respect you lost your dad and you remember and love him. Maybe it would be nice if you could also show your stepdad in some way on your wedding day how his support helped you become the woman you are today. It sounds like he tried to be there in all the ways you needed. \n\nObviously I don\u2019t know your life from this one small snippet so you are ultimately the one that knows what\u2019s right for you and I wish you the best for your future.", "NAH but I feel for your step-dad", "YTA. I really feel for him. Yes it\u2019s your bloody day, and ffs have it your way. You have plenty of people giving you the NTAs.  He was your father figure and truly cares for you. Catering to the dead is not a loyalty thing, it\u2019s a sign you really haven\u2019t stopped grieving. Having him walk you down the aisle is not a disloyal act against your father. I smh at the thought that weddings are start to finish all about the bride (and sometimes the groom) and what they alone want versus being a familial celebration. I think it\u2019s very cold hearted of you.", "NTA. I feel for your stepdad, but it is your day. \n\nAnother option could be both your mum and stepdad walk you down the aisle?", "NTA. It's your wedding. You're paying. But...I kind of get where step dad is coming from. It will send a signal whether it should, or shouldn't. It seems like you're fixated on making this about missing your dad and subconsciously you're hurting your stepdad, who, from your own words, has been good to you. Isn't there some role or way you could include him?", "Yes.\n\nAny man that treats a child who isn't his own like his own, is an absolute champion.\n\nYou treating him like that for no reason? Yeo you're the asshole.", "YTA\n\nHe raised you, he's a good man, he gave the most he could.\nOne wishes more epople were able to step up in a parent role like he did.\nYour choice is a petty one", "NAH - \n\nAwww, I feel so sad for your stepdad. This is all around so sad. There is someone there willing to give you unconditional love but your heart is not open to it. You probably never will be open to it but I hope one day you are because to have someone truly love you and you love them is really a lovely thing and something some people can only wish for. It's in addition to your dad not to replace him at all.\n\nBut if you don't feel that kind of love for him and don't want him to walk you down the aisle, then don't. Yes, it will send a message to the guests but there's nothing you can do about that. It is what it is. You can't force love.", "Your feelings that you have one father are legitimate and valid, completely understandable. \n\nBut you are the only child that he got to parent and I understand how it must hurt him to be rejected. \n\nNAH", "NTA because it's your choice but I feel really bad for your stepfather .... it's not your fault or responsibility but poor guy! Lost his wife and unborn child, lost his ability to be a father in the future and spent years trying to be accepted as one by the child he helped raising just to be denied over and over again. He must really love you and your mother!", "NAH.  Since you wanted your mom to walk you down the aisle, was it ever considered to let them both walk you together? That could be a third option, unless you simply don\u2019t want him involved at all.", "Unpopular opinion I guess but I do think YTA and making a huge thing out of something very simple - you lost your dad when you were a child and you were lucky enough to be given another person who took care of you and raised you. Why do you have to make it a point, on your wedding day for everyone to see, that this man never filled the spot in your heart that you still reserve for your dad and that you never \"emotionally connected\" to him? So what? He filled that role anyway and gave you all his love, and he even told you it would mean the world for him to walk you down the aisle. Can you not find ANY gratefulness in your heart at all? Your long-winded story sounds to me as if you actually enjoy some of the heartbreak you have caused him in the past and are causing him now - what for? What's the big deal? You think your dad is going to look down on you walking yourself to the altar on your wedding day and thinking \"Yes, that's my girl, glad she doesn't acknowledge that guy who made sure she was OK after I had to leave her too early..\"?? I really can't grasp how you can reject your family like that. Because that's what your stepdad is.", "NAH, but my sympathy is with your step-dad. He did everything he could and you just never opened your heart to him. \n\nMy stepson likes to say he has multiple hearts, one for each of his four parents. Love is not finite. He isn't your dad, but he could have been special in his own important role. I get at 10 you're just a kid, but you really lucked out with him as a step-dad and it sucks he's being shown how little he means. \n\nYour mom married a man who treated you as his own and she's just protecting her spouse from the blow you're dealing. I don't blame her. \n\nBut it is your wedding and you feel the way you feel. You shouldn't do anything that makes you uncomfortable.", "I totally get what you\u2019re saying and of course you are entitled to every feeling here. But it\u2019s also a little sad. I had a wonderful step dad and my dad. I danced with each of them at my wedding. My step dad was wonderful to me and it\u2019s ok to recognize your step dad for the important role he has had in your life. Maybe you could have a dance with him to recognize that. I suspect your dad would have been happy someone so loving cared so much about you growing up. He doesn\u2019t have to replace your dads love but maybe you could allow him to be someone who just loves you like a dad.", " NTA and while I feel badly that your stepdad is hurting, and lost so much in his life, it\u2019s your wedding and your choice.", "This one is complicated. \n\nYes. You are an AH. But I don\u2019t think I can vote YTA. \n\nNAH. Be nice to your stepdad.", "I guess I\u2019m the outlier here. YTA. You would not dishonor your father by having your stepdad walk you down the aisle. He knows he can never replace your father but it would honor him for the years of support he\u2019s given you.", "NAH - my heart breaks for your stepdad but it\u2019s not your responsibility to fill the void in his life. Hope you have a great day.", "YTA. Maybe N A H, but honestly life is full of little concessions for those we love so YTA OP. \n\nYou had your first (bio) dad for seven years. You might remember a few things before five and several things between 5&7 but in essence, you\u2019re choosing a rose colored image of a person over a very real and very much here person.\n\nYou\u2019ve had your second (step) dad in your life for 17 years versus 7 (the large majority of which you likely have no memory of) years with your first. In all reality your step dad is your father. That\u2019s who was there through the majority of your life. You say he was a good man who tried to be there for you as much as possible, but you held up a barrier. Stop punishing a good man for not being the super dad of your imagination. Because as harsh as this may seem, memories are extremely fallible (I suggest doing your own research) and while I\u2019m sure your dad really was great, he wasn\u2019t perfect. No one is. \n\nYou are SO lucky to have a man who wants to love and support you in a fatherly role. Be grateful. To shun the man who stepped up and was actually there, for someone who couldn\u2019t be ,is insanely insensitive. If you don\u2019t care about him then sure, don\u2019t include your stepdad. But if you do care for him, include him. Stop looking at is at a reminder of what you DON\u2019T have and look at is a beautiful example of what you DO have. \n\nI don\u2019t care if I get downvoted. OP I would rather internet strangers disagree with me, than have you damage an important relationship in your life. You came here for an objective answer, not an echo chamber, so here you go.", "Yep. You are an asshole. You slap every good step dad in the face. Beyond asshole.", "In my opinion, everyone is the AH here. \n\nYour mom and SD for pushing the issue on your big day. Your day = your rules.\n\nYou because you acknowledge he is a good man and I bet you benefitted from having him in your life, even if you don't see him as your dad. If you said he constantly harassed you and didn't support you in any way. It would be easy to understand but it ends up sounding like you just kicked him in the nuts.", "YTA - you can do whatever you want. But this man was in your life more than your dad. I feel like you love the memory of your father and you literally throw step dad to the side because your dad wasn't there. So the fact you denied it on both because of something you couldn't control. I honestly cannot imagine doing this to yourself and step dad. I mean this is honestly showing how it goes priority wise in your life.", "This will be anecdotal and i know isnt indicative of the relationship everyone has with their stepparents, but from someone who had a similar childhood and relationship with their birth parent, YTA.\n\nI had a similar feeling that you did, you missed the parent that wasn't there, the parent that you only have good memories of, and the thought of replacing them in a special moment seems unheard of, but just think for one minute. Would your dad be happy with the man your mom chose to marry, the man who from your post seems to be a pretty good dude. Would he want you to walk alone down the aisle or show some grace/love and walk with this man. \n\nI know I don't speak for you, but it could be an opportunity to show an immense amount of kindness to a person who has shown you that kindness for almost 20 years of your life.", "YTA-  you say this man tragically lost his wife and daughter.  He was good to you.  But you\u2019ve spent your whole life clinging to the idea of your bio dad.  I get that it was traumatic to you, but he\u2019s not there and stepdad is.  What a small, lovely gesture it would be to allow him to walk you down the aisle.  You are being selfish and childish-  yes, it\u2019s your day but you can expect this to put a strain on the relationships you two have.", "NTA. BUT not everyone gets a stepdad like yours, who's willing to love you as his own daughter. It's sad really, that his role in your life is only to be a giver (both love and money) while still being treated like the 3rd wheel by his SD.", "Respectfully, I don't think OP is TA but I think that you are allowing a valuable moment and bonding experience between you and your step father to be destroyed over your emotional unavailability. I understand that their is a heavy emotional toll that comes with the death of a father or any family member or close friend, but understanding from an adult perspective, your step-father willingly went into a relationship with your mother, who at the time was a widowed single mother with a 9 y/o child. Although it might not have been what you wanted at the time or even now he still took on your family as his responsibility and tried his best knowing that his step daughter would have endless amounts of emotional baggage. Your step-father, although going into the relationship he knew what he was signing up for and you as the child even if you have no actual responsibility to show any actual affection or appreciation for him, he tried and played an active role in an attempt to be a father figure in your life. I personally think that you are taking what you have for granted over something as small as walking down an aisle, I think that over anything that your father would have been grateful that someone was there to take care of you and made sure that if anything went wrong you'd always have a roof over your head and a home to come back to. I think that men understand that a good man does not come easily and the fact that you have had 2 strong and inspiring men play a father figure role in your lifetime is an incredible feat that shouldn't be taken for granted. People who show you unconditional love and devotion for years on end with no real return and would do anything for year simply out of their love for you are so rare in this world, you especially OP should know this after losing your father and knowing that no one could replace him, and the fact that someone really tried to take up your burden and treat you as family, offering multiple times to adopt you so that you could feel included and truly loved, wanting to walk you down the aisle on your wedding day etc, I think that it is a shame that you would let a bond that could be so beautiful be ruined because you are only ready for love in intimacy and not love unconditionally. OP is NTA and neither is step-father, I hope you can make a decision that will satisfy you because at the end of the day it is your life and you will have to continue to live it.", "Sounds like your stepdad tried to be a good dad to you and I can understand why he\u2019s disappointed but also I understand that it\u2019s your wedding\u2026. This may affect your relationship with him, and you have to decide if that\u2019s a concern for you or not", "NAH, it is just sad you couldn't bond with him as much as he wanted", "He's been in your life for 17 years and is a decent person. He offered to adopt you several times, you declined. He offered to walk you down the aisle, you declined. He wants to dance with you, you declined. Frankly, I don't think you like him very much. Liking him is all that is required to decide to have a dance, nothing more. And so, you're willing to dance with your grandma, because you like her. If only everyone could be so lucky to have a parent who tries so hard. Imagine if you wanted all of those things, wanted to be adopted, wanted to be walked down the aisle, and he refused, how small would that make you feel? I feel sorry for your step-dad. He thinks of you as a daughter and gets nothing but rejection regardless of circumstance. I understand grieving for your bio-dad but it's been 20 years, it's time to move on and allow your heart to heal enough that it isn't standing in the way of the relationships you still have. None of that requires ever forgetting your bio-dad.

With that said, it's not the job of a child to fill the gap in his life. (Offering multiple times to adopt you and have your name changed. Ick. Dude - let it go.)

It's your wedding and you don't owe anyone a place or role in it.  Nor do you owe your stepdad the place in your heart that belongs to your father.\n\nHowever, the hurt feelings of your stepdad (and your mom, by extension) are fully understandable.  He both feels the grief of his own loss and a sense of rejection from never quite gaining acceptance as a father.

You can also want to walk yourself for some feminism reason if you want. This is your day. You do you. (I absolutely don\u2019t want to say that women who share this moment with their dad ain\u2019t feminist, just that you don\u2019t have to walk the aisle with a man who agree to give you to another man. Everyone can do as they please). So you shouldn\u2019t have to justify yourself. And making your wedding about himself isn\u2019t nice at all. He will walk down the aisle with his wife, give a toast.

I never told my kids my preference, they just did what they wanted.", "NTA. But have you considered walking down the aisle w the groom? In my country the father of the bride does not give his daughter away, she is not his property. The bride and groom walk down the aisle, proceeding together towards the altar and their future.

He wants to feel for the first time like a real father to you and he wants to not feel ashamed because someone else is dancing with you. Those are his issues, not yours.

Especially since you feeling with dishonor your father and have your stepfather walk you down the aisle.\n\nThat being said, I think you could have explained it to your stepfather a little bit better so that he wouldn't have been his hurt. Instead of saying that's not on the table, I think you could have just said \"I would only want my father to do it and since he's not here I'd rather have no one to it, and I wouldn't feel comfortable having someone replace him.\" \n\nI think that would help him to feel better because he would see that it's not you rejecting him it simply you want to go honor your father.

I would even go so far as to say, let the guy walk down the aisle. But that\u2019s me I agree, that it\u2019s your wedding your choice. But statistically speaking, there\u2019s a better chance that the stepdad will be around in 10 years, then the new husband will.

He is gone and no amount of rejecting this man on such a personal level, especially after all he has done for  you that he was under no obligation to do, can change that.

Yes, because this is Reddit, and someone will always deliberately misinterpret your words to start an argument!\n\nThere are so many posts all over Reddit from people who have lost a parent early in childhood, either permanently through bereavement, or as good as through abandonment, or who have just been kept away from one of their parents, see less of one due to divorce. \n\nThey don't have loving, caring stepparents. At best, they might have overbearing or cold stepparents. At worst, they might have abusive stepparents of the very worst kind.\n\nI do think that OP's mum and stepdad messed up when she was younger by not addressing this together as a family. They should have tried to get some family therapy, or at least bought some books or done some reading on how best to introduce a new stepparent to a child whose other parent has died. \n\nThe 'bonus parent' who is an addition, not, never, ever, a replacement is such a simple and effective approach, it seems so obvious when you think about it but so many couples in this situation fail to use it!\n\nAnd her stepdad, I think, probably needed, still needs individual therapy with someone who has experience in grief counselling, due to his repeated insistence on adoption as a way of replacing the family he could never have back, or have again.\n\nWhat may be happening here, and he might not even realise it himself, on a conscious level, is that his latent grief means that he has a desperate yearning deep inside him that he needed OP to help him fill. \n\nBut that's not her job, and it's not fair to ask that of her now, and it certainly wasn't fair to ask that of her as a child!\n\nHowever, OP, I do believe that, you probably care about your stepdad, perhaps you might need to give yourself permission to admit that to yourself - it wouldn't be betraying your wonderful Dad to do so!\n\nIf that is the case, then be kind. Acknowledge the love and support that he has given you and allow him to dance with you, perhaps? \n\nWhy can't you dance with him and your grandmother both? There should be a way to make this work! I don't know how old and spry she is? Is she in her 60s or 80s or even older? If she has any mobility issues then she may not be able to dance for an entire song, so perhaps she could start dancing  with you to a slower song and then your stepdad could cut in, elegantly, at a prearranged point, as the DJ crossafades or the band switches to something more upbeat.\n\nYou can also acknowledge both your Dad and your stepdad as being equally loving, caring, and supportive but fulfilling slightly different roles for you in your speech.\n\nWhat would your Dad have wanted for you to have after he was gone? Wouldn't it have been someone who obviously cares as much for you as your stepdad? Again, you can love him, be loyal to him, and also love your stepdad for being a great stepdad. You can have room in your heart for both of them, but you have to give yourself the permission to do so first. \n\nThere's so much for you to think about here, OP, I don't think that you should rush into any decisions about the wedding yet, not when they have so much potential to hurt those close to you, even though that's not your intention.\n\nI think that you and your family need to sit down and talk properly, not about the wedding but about how all of you feel, probably with a therapist, or some other neutral party, as that may be the only way that they will give you the space to be heard and listen to you fully. It's too easy sometimes for parents (or anyone who's the other party) to hear the first phrase or sentence that you say as an attack on them and stop listening to the rest, or even interrupt and to start to talk over you!\n\nA neutral space with a mediator, who doesn't necessarily have to be a therapist, if you have a trusted family member such as an aunt, that understands your point of view but is also trusted by your parents, might be what you need to at least kick off the process of all of you listening to each other and understanding how each other feels right now and has felt in the past.\n\nThe goal of this initial discussion would simply be for your mum and stepdad to accept that there is a problem, not to reach any kind of resolution! Neither side should have high expectations. It might take a lot of work and a long time on both sides to really untangle all the knots, probably some  before your wedding, enough to reach a peaceful compromise, but it will be a long term process for all of you.\n\nI will say, though, please don't judge your mum and stepdad too harshly! As parents (well-intentioned, good-hearted ones only here), we're not given a manual when our kids are born. We are constantly just making things up as we go along. \n\nWe do make mistakes, we do fuck up and not just the little day to day stuff. Sometimes it's the big stuff and we only realise that we messed up with hindsight, when it's far too late to change what we did or said, when at the time we thought that we were doing the right thing, often based on what we knew at the time, sometimes during a difficult or stressful period of our lives.\n\nI know this was long, OP, but it was written with live and kindness.

The decision was made for two reasons. My dad died when I was 7 and he would be my number one choice if he were alive but he's not and two, my mom has made it perfectly clear that she would find it disrespectful to my stepdad if she walked me down the aisle and so would not do it. Given that both my parents are out and I don't want to ask my paternal grandparents to do too much, my grandma and I are already sharing a special dance, walking alone is what I feel the most comfortable doing.\n\nI could ask my stepdad and even when I contemplated my decision, I knew he would want to do it. But it would make me sad to have him walk me instead of my dad if I'm honest. I think my stepdad is a good man and he has tried his very best to be a dad for me. But I didn't want a dad when I lost mine. I wanted my dad. Nobody else was ever going to be able to fill that role in my heart.\n\nI asked my mom and stepdad if they would like to do a joint toast or two separate ones and whether they would like to walk down the aisle/dance to specific songs. While discussing this my stepdad asked who I would be walking with and I told him I was walking alone. He offered to do it and I said it was a lovely offer but I would walk alone. He pressed me on why and I said it felt like the best option. He said it would mean the world to him if he could do it, if just once he could feel like he's a real dad and not just second place to my dad. I told him I understood but it was not an option on the table.\n\nHe said he was already being shamed by having to watch me dance with my grandma when it should be a father/daughter dance. But to have everyone watch me walk alone when they know I have a stepdad is going to send a very big message. \n\nI know people will ask about details on our relationship, etc. I met my stepdad when I was 9 and he married my mom when I was 10. He offered to adopt me and give me his last name and I turned him down five times in the 8 years I lived with them. He was married before my mom and he lost his wife and unborn baby in an accident. He was also made sterile by the same accident. He always longed to be a dad. We got along well but our relationship was always more to him than it was to me. Where he sees a daughter and wants a daughter, I see a good man and someone who is a great spouse to my mom and is good to me, but does not fill the father role he wants to emotionally for me. Physically, he did. But emotionally I never felt like he was my dad and everyone in our lives is aware that I feel as though I have one dad and my stepdad is my stepdad.\n\nMy mom and stepdad are not paying or contributing to the wedding in any way. My fianc\u00e9 and I both have savings and we're putting those into the wedding. Though our wedding will be smallish since we want to prioritize other things.\n\nMy mom and stepdad say I am rude and heartless for turning down the offer.

He wanted to be a dad to me, but I was *really* traumatized by my mom's previous dating history and the \"dad\" roles in my life had been filled by my grandad and great grandad so I wasn't having it (I was 8 or 9 when we met and 10 when they had a shotgun wedding to prepare for my baby brother). \n\nLuckily I have a younger brother who really wanted a dad AND my stepdad and mom had their own kid together. he offered to adopt us and give us his last name (which I firmly refused, I have my grandad's last name.

If a loving, parental relationship builds then that's lovely for everyone involved, but the biggest mistake you can make is to push for a closeness that can't be forced.\n\nIt's completely understandable given his tragic past that OP's stepfather struggled to do this, but I suspect that if he'd focused on helping OP to maintain her relationship with her real Dad, on being what SHE needed, she would feel much more comfortable with him now as an adult and there would be a genuine closeness that would be recognised in the wedding.

Personally though, if it was my dilemma to solve, I\u2019d feel cruel denying him this. Stepdad just wants his love and presence in her life acknowledged and respected in way that would mean so much to him - and on a day that is supposed to be about love, there can never be too much of it around.

That would be different. Instead, OP has said she doesn't feel any attachment to him at all despite him being there for her since she was young.

It is fine that OP does not want that of course.\n\nI do understand the wishes of OP somewhat, but boy - will she regret that decision in the future.

From the rest of the post, I thought that the conversation was had with her mom and stepdad together, but only the toast part actually pertained to him and OP. I was actually wondering why OP brought up the walk down the aisle while stepdad was there since she was so clear she didn't want to do it with him, but my friend pointed out that she may not have intended for him to be there when she was discussing it with her mom and the songs may have just been a playlist request offer for a song her mom and stepdad might want to dance to together.\n\nu/DiligentDefinition33, could you please explain what you were offering/talking to your mom and stepdad about when you were having this conversation?

You can do whatever you want in your wedding\u2026and should.  Your stepfather has shown that he loves you and healthy love from anyone is always a gift.

Doesn\u2019t matter that the step dad had one more year with OP. That would have no bearing if the parents pushed him as a dad when she was 10. That would have closed off those feelings and set her up for this relationship they have now. Step parents ruin their own chances by being pushy. If you push in the beginning it mean you will *never* get the relationship you want. Feel bad for the guy since he also has trauma and I bet he did come on too strong back then.

Oh, poor OP has too many people who love her. I mean, there are so many people out there who would kill to have someone step up to love them. Reddit does a terrible job at being like, yeah, you don't need that step-parent trying to love you! They need to get a clue. Instead of reminding posters that it's not an either/or scenario.

I know you said you\u2019re a father, and this is no means an insult to you as a person or a father, but I urge you to seriously step back and contemplate that not everyone will share the same sentiment on certain topics, maybe even your kids, and that\u2019s 100% okay:) let\u2019s put this to rest and you have a good day!", "There is a legal element to it. If you adopt a kid then you have to look after that child. So for example if you marry someone with a kid and adopt them, if you later divorce you legally will need to pay child support etc. I can be a method to ensure that should something unfortunate occur to the other parent you have a legal standing to see and look after the child.\n\nBut this all comes with the caveat that the child has to want this too.

He is not an evil man for wanting to adopt her or for asking her multiple times.  I get that she loves her dad, but he passed, and this man, her stepdad, has been there for her over the years.  I'm sorry, but what she is doing is a slap in the face to a man who has accepted her as his own.

I've nearly died when they where younger. If i had and my wife had found a man like your step dad, that would be so great. So much consolation. If there was a way to ask me i'd advise my daughter to honor that man's love and support because through that she would honor me. Because now there's no father figure at all walking the bride down the isle. \n\nYou make this wedding an intense sad memory that isn't about your new life with your husband at all but very clearly about you mourning over your dad and your very obvious rejection of your step dad. That's what your guests will remember.\n\nI wish you a very nice wedding day but i truly hope you'll seek help.

Or just call him \"the man my mother married but had nothing to do with my upbringing\". That should put the cherry on the top for you.", "YTA.

But my step dad is still a father figure to me. He's a dad. And when my bio old man was still around I still considered my step as a dad. It doesnt have to be a competition.

My husband has been a parent to my daughter since she was 7 years old, doing all the parent things including going to her performances and taking her to the dentist and worrying about her and wanting the best for her.  I bet this stepdad did those things too. Why would he not be in second place?  He filled in for her missing dad the best he could  and now she is making a spectacle of showing everyone how inadequate he has been.  Why would he not be recognized as a parental figure?  Why are people endorsing this woman's unkindness to the person who did his best to give her some of what was missing?", "YTA, and it's shameful to see all these people mollycoddling you.

Ultimately it's your wedding and you can do what you wish, and its wrong of anyone else to insist otherwise.

No one is saying that your stepdad has to feel exactly like your dad, but it sounds like he stood in loco parentis to you for many years.   Family and parenthood take many different forms.  Maybe there is a way you can find a way to include him. Maybe have him walk down the aisle partway. Or have him hold a photo of your dad as he does so?    \n\n\nAgain, I dont think YTA.

Honestly, everyone is different.   She's not being disrespectful or selfish. And she's not being ungrateful.  She feels the way she feels.", "NAH. I don't think your stepdad is being too selfish like others have said. I think it is incredibly hard to be a step parent, put in so much work for decades and still feel like an outsider, so unless he was an awful man, I can't fault him for wanting that.\n\nI think it's a sad situation all around. But honestly, this is why I never want a wedding. I just find it all so gross and selfish. For your \"special day,\" the people who love you most are leaving with wounds. What is the point of that?!\n\nI don't consider my stepmom to be a mom by any means, but I like her because she makes my dad happy. The first time she said, \"I love you\" at the end of a conversation, my first thought was \"uh I have a mom, no thanks.\" But I kept that to myself. \n\nIf my mom, my favorite person in the world, died and I decided to get married, I would let my stepmom play that role not because it is something I would want or need, but because I know how much joy it would bring her and my dad to have her be fully included. I would find a different kind of joy giving them that and honoring my mom in some other way.\n\nThe amount of crap brides/grooms pull because they think they deserve to be fully selfish just because they decided to get married pisses me tf off to be honest. \n\nI'm not saying YTA because it is your wedding, I guess, but damn you are a bit cold imho. 17 years in your life, caring about you and your mom, and you can't give him one dance. Damn.", "I'm so sorry. You're not an asshole - just in a terribly difficult position. Your mother SHOULD walk you down the aisle, if that is your first preference, and the way she's being is awful. I feel a tremendous amount of pity for your step father and what he's been through, but it's never a child's job to fill those big emotional gaps for an adult in their life. \n\n\nThis is a very different situation, but I lost my brother in a car accident several years ago. I met my now husband a couple years after my brother died, we got engaged and I went to meet his family. His sister kept jokingly calling me \"Sissy\", and it just ..  I can't describe the feeling.

I know weddings are supposed to be about the couple and doing things how they want, but this just feels so sad and childish.

Is he perfect? Of course not. He's got flaws, and some of them are just as bad as the flaws my mom and stepdad have.

Maybe it could give some perspective on those others in this thread judging a guy who likely tried his best and is getting no reciprocation, which truly hurts.\n\nI married a woman who was struggling as a single-parent to a smart and beautiful 5-year-old. When I moved in and we eventually got married, it was my #1 goal to be a great father to this little girl whose dad was jumping around the country avoiding child support and responsibility. The marriage was to us as a family, not just to her mother. I included her in the proposal and asked her if she wanted me to be her dad first. While my wife was the breadwinner, I cleaned, cooked, took her to the park, played dolls, took her shopping. Our family soon grew and I gave her another brother and sister. She was an awesome big sister and I always treated her the same as my bio-kids.\n\nShe drifted away from me as a teenager. She was always very close with her mother and grandfather, so I gave her that space. I didn't feel the need to force a relationship when it appeared everything was good. She just liked spending more time with them. Frankly, when I was a teenager, I hated when my parents pushed spending time with me, so I thought I was doing the right thing. I still spent plenty of days helping out as a band parent, running forgotten books to school, driving around to athletics practice and helping decorate and clean for post-prom parties.\n\nSenior year, she skipped Father's Day... never acknowledged me and left the house to spend it with friends. I gave her a graduation and good-luck-at-college gift, wrote a letter that said it hurt me and I saw we had been drifting away the last year and wanted to know what I did wrong, yet I would always be there for a chat, a call late at night if she needed, and a hug and a shoulder to cry on any time. I loved her and wished her the best years away at college. She replied with a letter of her own (which my now-ex wife gave me on the day before Thanksgiving), stating I was never her father and never will be and she never wanted to see me again. So I gave her that space again. I have had friends and family who know the whole story assure me she plans to hold true to that promise. It hurts, but I'll never turn down an opportunity or \"rub salt\" in an old wound if she ever comes around.\n\nI got shit on by Reddit a few years ago when going through this initially, many speaking up spouting how I must have done something terribly wrong and backing up her NC and I'm ignorant of my own behavior that probably caused this. Hey, sometimes people don't know the whole story and sometimes a know-it-all 18-year-old is the asshole.\n\nIf I were the step-dad in OPs situation, I totally understand where he's coming from. It was one of my biggest fears that when my daughter got married, that she would choose to ignore the person who helped raise her for 15 years because I wasn't really her \"father\". She proved it once she moved away to college. It was the catalyst that tore down my already rocky marriage with her mother. Relationships are complicated. It tore me up on Father's Day this year when my other daughter gave me a card that said, \"I won't ever forget you on Father's Day and will always be here for you.\"\n\nMy question for OP if you read this; did you ever really give him a chance to be the person you wanted to walk you down the aisle?", "True.

I think it would be quite reasonable to ask once when younger, leave it with the understanding that you're open, and ask again once when older - 16+ probably.

She for whatever reason thinks her biological dad wouldn't want to see her walk down the aisle with her stepdad? That's wild. If he's a good man, who's been good to her mother and her, even if she doesn't see him as \"her\" dad, he's still been the father. He's unfortunately had to be the one going through all the difficult years with her too, so I'm sure she's experienced more arguments and all that with him which doesnt help.\n\nShe has an idyllic view of her father that died and for whatever reason doesn't see what this man has tried to do for her. She doesn't say anything bad about the guy, just that he's not her dad in her eyes? I'm not sure how else to sum it up other than her not having actually truly moved on from her father's death. I don't think OP is an asshole for making a choice about her wedding day. But I do think it is a bit of an asshole take to minimize everything this guy has probably done given his commitment to her family to consider him her mom's spouse but not a father. \n\nIt is, in some ways, heartless as she says the parents called it. Maybe not this decision in a vacuum, but overall. Not even a stepdad-daughter dance in addition to a grandparent dance? I really feel bad for the guy. \n\nAnd people point out he kept asking to adopt her over the years... like... given her age he didn't even need to ask. He could have, as the step parent and with her dad deceased, just adopted her with her mom's permission. But it was important to him to have her agree, so he kept trying. Not because he wants to own her but probably because he cares. \n\nAs a father idk how id feel about my daughter doing this to someone if I died and my wife did end up remarrying. I'd probably be disappointed, because I'd want all the love and care someone chose to show for my daughter that I wasn't able to myself, to be respected and reflected back to them. If I wasn't here for her, I could only hope someone half as caring as this guy seems to be would show up to pick up the torch. He wouldn't be taking my place. He'd be continuing the journey, and I would want, wholeheartedly, for someone to take on that role. Even if they weren't formally a dad or married to my wife, I'd want someone to fill the role for her. And if they walked her down the aisle, I'd be damn proud myself.", "True, especially the not even a stepdad-stepdaughter dance part. Wild...

Obviously when two families blend, the ideal reality is that it feels like one whole family in the end, but that isn\u2019t always the reality and often it is no one\u2019s fault. It ESPECIALLY isn\u2019t the fault of any of the children involved. It sounds like he (without meaning to) put a lot of pressure on you to be his child in the absence of his deceased child/any future children. I\u2019d venture to guess this pressure contributes to the fact that you didn\u2019t bond with him in quite the way he bonded with you.

Otherwise, OP is just being selfish.", "> Sounds to me as if you actually enjoy some of the heartbreak you have caused him in the past \n\nThis was my take too. The way OP talks about him gives off serious contempt, she acknowledges that he\u2019s a great man who\u2019s tried to be the best father figure he can be, yet she seems to love reminding him that he\u2019s nothing to her, it\u2019s incredibly sad \n\nThere\u2019s tons of people out there wishing they could have a halfway decent biological dad in their life, let alone being fortunate enough to have a loving step parent too. OP is willing to throw that all way over a meaningless ceremony. A wedding ceremony isn\u2019t as important as you think it is OP, it\u2019s about the memories you make with the people attending as you step into the next phase of your life, and you\u2019re choosing to step into it by telling your step dad that he isn\u2019t  worth anything to you, after he spent almost 2 decades doing his best. \n\nUltimately it\u2019s your wedding, but choosing to walk alone (after all your other options were exhausted) over letting him spend 30 seconds  with you walking down the aisle is just sad. I can guarantee your father would be disappointed in you treating the man who stepped into his place as best as he could so coldly", "I am getting a lot of I Will Just Walk Myself Down The Aisle so everyone knows how deeply I feel the loss of my biological father vibes. Maybe I\u2019m just reading drama where there isn\u2019t any. Idk. \nBut the bride and groom can do what they want. I do feel for the stepdad though - that\u2019s such a tough job and full of so many land mines and it sounds like he worked hard to navigate that situation and she just is cold.  NTA", "Yeah, I feel similarly. It\u2019s OP\u2019s wedding, and she can do what she wants, but man\u2026 walking down the aisle at a small wedding would take maybe thirty seconds. She knows that giving her stepfather those thirty seconds of her life would mean the world to him, but she can\u2019t bring herself to give this good man that small a gesture? It\u2019s so sad.", "Yeah. Ultimately it just seems like OP is still taking things for granted like a teenager would. I feel bad for him.", "I'm glad someone said this. OP is in her late 20s at this point. I would expect someone her age to understand that 1. new people who come into our lives don't replace the old ones, and 2. sometimes we do things that maybe aren't totally our favorite things because they mean so much to the people we care about who care about us. \n\nI get OP has grief over her dad dying, but I have a hard time understand how OP is getting hurt over letting her stepdad into the wedding in SOME fatherly capacity. Maybe it will hurt a bit that it's her stepdad and not her dad, but her dad can't be there anyway. But it will hurt her stepdad so much, and so needlessly IMO, to not include him.", "YTA. This post reads very entitled.  Drew a line of - well it would make me sad for somebody to walk me down the isle because they won't be my dad, but let me consider everyone else except my step father. Also seems like  is/has been intentionally distant because he isn't her father. You have been actively punishing him, because you haven't processed whatever you need to around your father. Seems like the relationship is entirely one sided. Post is a big red flag for getting married IMO.", "I think either NAH or YTA. At the end of the day, it's OP's wedding and her choice, so she can do what she wants. But it seems like her step dad has been trying to be there for you for most of her life\u2014a lot longer than her bio dad was, by no fault of his own of course. If her bio dad was as great as she remembers, he would want her to be happy and to have a father. I think he'd be glad to see that there's someone there who is willing to be that for her, instead of throwing away this second chance at having a father she's been given when many people barely get one.\n\nImagine how it would have felt for her growing up had her stepfather refused to care for her as his own because he had lost his baby and she could never replace them. He could have done that, but he didn't. He treated her as his own, and it seems like she's rejected him at every turn, which is really sad for both of them... As a child, this was understandable. But as an adult, it comes off as kind of ungrateful and maybe even cruel. Maybe her bio dad would have made her teen years phenomenal, or maybe that's when her relationship with him would have fallen apart. It's impossible to know.\n\nA wedding is literally a blending of families. Maybe this would be a good time to show some gratitude for her blended family, because it sounds like her stepfather has been a good partner to her mother and has tried very hard to be a good stepfather to her. Her dad would be glad to know there was someone to take care of her when he couldnt.\n\nAll that said, @afrodasiac, given which comments she's replied to and which she's chosen to ignore, it seems plausible that she was looking for an echo chamber and not an unbiased opinion. Pretty common for this sub unfortunately. I hope it's not the case, but it seems like she doesnt like to make concessions or change her mind so she probably is looking for people to reinforce her decision.", "She says her step dad is a good man who did his best to be a father to her. She just doesn\u2019t want him.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost two decades of him loving and caring for her while she remains unable to grieve and move on. \n\nIt\u2019s sad. Yeah, it\u2019s her wedding and it\u2019s her choice, but it is a shitty thing to do and it does close the door on any future relationship. Something that\u2019ll be more important to her once she has her own kids and realizes her childish behavior. \n\nYTA", "I don't think OP will read this, but say it regardless.\n\nWhatever she does, will change their relationship forever, for better or worse. If she accepts him as her dad, he will become her dad. If she rejects him, he will never forget the pain, will never be the same again. \n\nI hope he doesn't change the love for her regardless of her decision, but I strongly doubt it.", "I do get a little tired of the Bridzilla syndrome. It is her wedding, but brides tend to put way too much importance on getting everything their way because IT'S MY SPECIAL DAY! \n\nWeddings are more about celebrating with family and friends. This brides actions seem so hurtful. This man lost his first wife and child. He thinks of her as his daughter, and she's refusing to let him walk her down the aisle. Why? What would it take away from her. It just feels unnecessarily cruel for no good reason.", "I agree so much. While I do vote NAH, I think OP rejected a blessing in her life.\n\nSo many who have lost a parent would love to find someone who cares for them as their own. \n\nThose we hold dear do not have to be blood related. In fact, it sometimes can be even more special because someone is choosing to love you without feeling obligated to because of blood", "Agreed! And this is purely anecdotal, but if I died tomorrow I would want my daughter to remember me, but not hold me on a pedestal to the point that no other good man could fill my shoes. I'd want my wife to move on, and my daughter to move on too.", "She may be lucky but you cannot force a relationship. We don't know why she loved her father who passed away as much as she did or what transpired with the step father since then.\n\nIt sounds like stepdad really wanted a daughter, was too eager to make it happen, and OP backed away as a result. He asked multiple times to adopt her and if we take it down a notch imagine a guy you have no interest in asks you out near annually despite being told no. **Refusing to listen when someone tells you no will damage the relationship.**\n\nShe may be lucky to have a person in her life that's cared for her and helped provide for her but if she ultimately decides that this is how she wishes to proceed then that's up to her. \n\nThe stepdad is probably disappointed but forcing it would just be awkward. Unless she genuinely wants him there, he shouldn't be there nor should he want to be there anymore disappointed or not. I know I wouldn't want to be there out of pity. \n\nNAH", "Finally someone said it. There is no way I can see OP as NTA here. Ffs this dude gave up so much to raise a child that isn\u2019t biologically his. And his thanks? \u201cNah you\u2019re not my real dad\u201d.", "A lot of people would kill for a father that seems to care as much as her stepfather.", "Definitely YTA, She is being incredibly immature with how she handles her family relations. This read like a 16 year old teenager.", "And that is why being a step parent is a thankless job.  I agree with you \ud83d\udcaf%.  She\u2019s heartless and TA.  I feel so bad for this man.", "Man OP has no clue how hard it is to be a step-parent. By OP\u2019s account he treated her like his own child and raised her as a daughter. And she treats him like that\u2019s just expected and she never \u201cwanted that\u201d. No walk down the aisle or father/daughter dance. Basically she wants to specifically rub it in that he\u2019s not her father and he never will be.\n\nThat would be soul-crushing for someone that I raised from a 10 year old child.

Had to keep that relationship secret, because heaven only knew what my Mom would do if she found out - to either one of us.\n\nThen came time for me to get married. I had to break it to her that I was in contact with my Dad and wanted him to be there. She agreed she would not make a scene, but that she was in control of all of it - no Father/Daughter dance or anything. (I had a private ceremony out of town, wedding reception at hometown.)\n\nBy agreeing to that, I broke my Dad's heart. He left town the night of my wedding reception, and I never heard from him again (it's been 23 years). He left his long time girlfriend whom he lived with, took a car full of stuff and took off. (I've since found where he is but I've still been too afraid to contact him.)\n\nI regret agreeing to let my Mom win all these years. My heart is...incomplete, broken.

I'm sure he had his faults but I hope for OP sake she finds a way to balance her view of her dad. I could see her looking at her partner as a parent and expecting him to fit a warped view of her dad. My friend lost her father at 13 and I've watched her rip apart relationships based on what she thinks her dad would have done or said. I don't wish that level of hero worship on anyone.

I wish I had a better excuse for the way I treated my stepdad, but the effects my mother and her behavior had on me are a web of knots that I'm still trying to work out with my psychiatrist to this day. I was never mean to him, but I just never felt 'at home' when I was living with him and my mom. I think it was primarily because of my biodad walking out, so I just expected that to be a thing that all my dads did. And I never felt 'at home' anywhere because we moved around so much.  And sure enough, my mom packed the two of us up and hauled ass to another state while blaming my step-dad for driving her away. She left my little brother there, which I know left him with some long-lasting scars as well. Queue a parade of more men coming into her/my life, like some kind of carousel. I just became so numb to it. She's been with my latest step-dad for over a decade now but I think that's primarily because both of them are older. I can't stand visiting them because there's so many bad memories in that house. Yelling, screaming, the time I got up in his face and was ready to physically fight him because of the things he was saying. \n\nMy mom was who she was. But the vast majority of father figures in my life were absolute garbage too. That's why my step-dad, my brother's dad, really stands out. Stable guy, tried his best, wanted to adopt me, took great care of my brother. But when you go through life with so few people sticking around permanently, you learn to build up walls. \n\nGranted, this doesn't excuse OP's situation because it sounds like her step-dad has been there for a long haul. I would pay a fortune for that. Nothing like coming out of one of your childhood bedrooms and seeing a random guy sleeping in your mom's room. I feel like if my brother's dad had been able to stick around longer, I really would have warmed up to the idea of having a 'real' dad around. \n\nThe reason it took me so long to come around and repair the relationship with my step-dad and brother was because I had to grow up and get out from under my mother's thumb. I always knew she wasn't the best person, but it wasn't until I entered my late 20's, early 30's, that I went, \"Hang on a minute, I'm a grown adult, I live by myself, I can talk to whoever I want.\" and then queue me reconnecting with a LOT of family members my mother had burned bridges with, including my step-dad. And when I did, they all understood. They'd been dealing with her for years, and I think they were just glad I came out the other side okay. \n\nSo IDK what's going on in your step-daughter's life, but sometimes it does take time of private introspection, and maybe some therapy.  I hope the same is true for OP, too, and that she hits that point BEFORE her parents are on their way out. Maybe your daughter will too, in time. \n\nIt's a shame because you and I will never get back those years that were spent apart from our loved ones for whatever reason or another. And I've had to come to terms with that. But at least for now, I can keep reaching out to my step-dad, my brother, all those family members and just trying to enjoy what I have left while I can.

This must hurt.", "Whenever a friend of mine has thoughts about taking on a child that isn't his...raising the kid and loving the kid... this is a good story to share with him. Not only he will be treated poorly, he will even have many people applauding that treatment.", "Reddit is so pro choice for everyone's emotions that they don't care who suffers as long as you're \"telling your truth\", like some mild sacrifice to make someone over the moon happy is the great sin.\n\nI'm so glad to see the slow tip in the scales away from all this self centered living and actions. Just because you want something for yourself doesn't mean it's the right thing to do. We act like our feelings should dictate all our actions and allow us to act like petulant toddlers.\n\nGrow up people.", "I am sure she has hurt him numerous times over the years, and he tries to let it go. I've been a step parent for 20 years. I love them like my own. You have to have thick skin.", "And she's stated that she knows it will send a message and she's fine with that message being, \"I don't like my step-dad and want him out of my life, even though he's great. I'm just petty and trying to cut off my parents and any loving relationship I have with them.\"", "I mean a lot of families arent sexist and old school and don\u2019t see the need for it.\n\nBut who cares? Why should someone\u2019s wedding be tailored around gossips? If someone doesn\u2019t want to do something during their wedding they don\u2019t have to. If the wedding isn\u2019t for the two people getting married, why even have a wedding? If the purpose of a wedding is just to pat the fathers on the back, just skip the whole thing and have the fathers throw themselves a congratulatory party, fuck.", "The world where women don\u2019t belong to men or need ownership transferred from one man to another at their weddings, and so a lot of people walk down the aisle in some way other than escorted by their fathers.", "The world we live in is 2023. People can do what they want with their weddings. They can do it at the courthouse alone, they can walk with their dog, they can get married on surf boards in the ocean, they can have their entire improv troop walk them down the isle. It's no longer a transaction between parents, it's now an expression of joy between the people getting hitched.", "Lots of brides walk alone.  They often are repelled at the remnants of a ceremony during which the bride is sold to he husband's family.", "I can almost guarantee your relationship with your stepchildren is all the better for you having this kind of mentality.", "What?  That's exactly what makes OP the AH.  just because it is her choice doesn't mean she's not an AH.", "Ice in those veins for sure. Wow I can't even imagine what the man who stepped up and was her father for a decade is feeling right now.", "Don't do that. My stepdad ended up adopting me, and I always thought of him as just my dad. He walked me down the aisle and everything. Granted, I didn't lose my bio dad at 9 like OP, I was half her age, but that shows not every kid will be the same about it. Hell, you can have bio kids that are distant too.", "Exactly. Would he also be pitching a fit if she wanted to walk alone because \"giving the bride away\" is a tradition born out of patriarchal bullshit? If her dad was alive, but her parents were divorced, would he be mad if she asked both men to walk her down the aisle?", "Right and it's not like he's getting iced out. She's asking her mom and stepdad if they would like to make a speech as a concession. She may not see him as a father to replace the bio one she lost but it isn't like she hates or resents him. It's just that she never felt a bond with him the way she had with her bio dad. If walking down the aisle with step dad will just make her sad abt her own bio dad missing her wedding (on a day that's supposed to be a happy one for her) then I see why OP might want that. Tbh, the situation is sad what with OP being a daughter who never wanted a replacement for her dad getting a stepdad who seems like a nice man but due to the loss of his own family prior, was trying for a long time to get OP to accept his wish for family. But it is what it is. Rather than rock the boat, both should accept that this is the best their relationship can ever get and just respectfully live with it.", "This is exactly why I wanted to walk myself down the aisle. Even before my dad happen to pass before my wedding, I didn\u2019t want anyone to walk me. After he passed I had multiple family members offer, but it was so important for me not to have anyone because I wasn\u2019t their property. This was a joining of me and my husband, not him taking ownership.", "It's nice you remember your dad so idealistically, but he has been gone most of your life and there is someone you are hurting badly who had nothing to do with him being gone.  Holding onto someone for that long, and depriving yourself, and your step-father of a potentially wonderful relationship is cold and heartless.  Nobody admires that in a person.  One day it will be too late, and you will have missed opportunities with your step dad that a lot of you g women only wish they could have.\n\nShame on you.", "Being a stepparent is hard AF. You are damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t. OP says he was a good man and tried to be a father figure to her. Even if stepdad isn\u2019t her \u201cdad\u201d he was a parent to her all those years. He took care of her for many years and yet it still isn\u2019t good enough. It is a thankless job. \nShe\u2019s NTA-it is her wedding but I think she could have been kinder to a man who took part in raising her for years and by her own admission is a \u201cgood man.\u201d", "Those grandkids are never going to see step grandpa, which is sad because that\u2019s a deprivation of their relationship (whatever it would be) with step grandpa and grandkids", "Hey that's great for your stepdad! Unfortunately the stats don't seem so good. Every single guy I've seen go the stepdad road got burned.", "My post to OP was nicer than this.\nBut I wanted to stop and say \u201cno fucking shit\u201d on this comment", "Reddit is one of the least emphatic places I swear", "That detail is what tipped this entire story into bullshit territory for me. Still a fun thought experiment I guess, but fake af.", "Dude same.  I can barely remember if my wife walked with her dad down the aisle.  Everyone's looking at the bride, not whatever schlub is standing next to her... and that's how it should be.", "Exactly, on all this. This is why being a stepparent is such a shit position to have and why no one really wants the job. You can give that kid everything you have - your time, money, energy, love, encouragement, support - never miss a sports game, or dance recital, or band performance, and you still get treated like you mean NOTHING to the kid.\n\nIt is so degrading and discouraging. The stepdad sounds like he was just used to support the OP and now she's tossing him aside like last week's leftovers. It is a heartless move to make.", "Yes this is exactly how I feel! One of my best friends lost her dad when she was a child,and to this day, she still sees him as the ideal father and person because she was cheated from having a longer time with him. That\u2019s one of the many terrible things about losing a parent so young. I\u2019m sure OPs father was a lovely person, But I\u2019m also sure that he was human with flaws. Of course nobody could ever replace her father, but it seems like the stepfather really wants to be present in her life, and she\u2019s being just a little dismissive about it because he\u2019ll never quite measure up. This is the family that fate put in her path after her father\u2019s passing, and perhaps she should consider letting him play more of a role. If I were the stepdad, I would be crushed too. It\u2019s a blessing to have step parents who care for the children as their own.", "That is a beautiful, gut wrenching, response.", "\u201cI don\u2019t owe anybody anything so I should be able to do what I want, when I want, to whoever I want, and I should be supported in my decision\u201d is way too common of a sentiment", "As a step parent who did all those things and am very much never referred to even as step mom, this idea that my step kids would owe me anything is foul. \n\nMe helping raise them was the condition of being with my husband. Either I decided to be an adult in their life that was responsible for their well being or I left. This was not a \"job\" this was the situation, acting like you're owed anything for putting yourself in that place is so entitled I can't even. \n\nStep parent or bio parent are not owed anything. They decided to have kids, they don't get to decide how the kids are going to love the rest of their life.", "Thank you for the kind words, I truly hope so.", "Shit, I would have given my left tit for a Single fucking adult that gave an actual shit about me.\ud83d\ude05\nI feel very bad for the stepfather. \nOP should have been in all the therapy", "I\u2019d say she\u2019s the asshole, she\u2019s loved her hole life comparing him to someone she can only remember through rose tinted goggles and who wasn\u2019t there most of her life. She\u2019s built a perfect image of her dad in her head and it honestly feels like she is going out of her way to hurt him. I\u2019ve seen so many people in this thread say \u201cwell that\u2019s just tradition and based in misogyny.\u201d Well she choose to have a traditional wedding and is treating the guy who raised her with genuine love like someone she reluctantly interacts with.", "To me, it's just cruel. And no doubt will need something from him in the future, and her entitled butt won't think a thing about asking.", "Agreed, OP's being unnecessarily cruel. One can honor the dead while still honoring those who are alive and committed to loving you for decades. Sheesh! YTA"]}
