{"id": 27110, "submission_id": "16lqhmp", "title": "AITA for turning down my stepdad's offer to walk me down the aisle?", "selftext": "I (27f) have chosen to walk down the aisle alone on my wedding day. The decision was made for two reasons. My dad died when I was 7 and he would be my number one choice if he were alive but he's not and two, my mom has made it perfectly clear that she would find it disrespectful to my stepdad if she walked me down the aisle and so would not do it. Given that both my parents are out and I don't want to ask my paternal grandparents to do too much, my grandma and I are already sharing a special dance, walking alone is what I feel the most comfortable doing.\n\nI could ask my stepdad and even when I contemplated my decision, I knew he would want to do it. But it would make me sad to have him walk me instead of my dad if I'm honest. I think my stepdad is a good man and he has tried his very best to be a dad for me. But I didn't want a dad when I lost mine. I wanted my dad. Nobody else was ever going to be able to fill that role in my heart.\n\nI asked my mom and stepdad if they would like to do a joint toast or two separate ones and whether they would like to walk down the aisle/dance to specific songs. While discussing this my stepdad asked who I would be walking with and I told him I was walking alone. He offered to do it and I said it was a lovely offer but I would walk alone. He pressed me on why and I said it felt like the best option. He said it would mean the world to him if he could do it, if just once he could feel like he's a real dad and not just second place to my dad. I told him I understood but it was not an option on the table.\n\nHe said he was already being shamed by having to watch me dance with my grandma when it should be a father/daughter dance. But to have everyone watch me walk alone when they know I have a stepdad is going to send a very big message. \n\nI know people will ask about details on our relationship, etc. I met my stepdad when I was 9 and he married my mom when I was 10. He offered to adopt me and give me his last name and I turned him down five times in the 8 years I lived with them. He was married before my mom and he lost his wife and unborn baby in an accident. He was also made sterile by the same accident. He always longed to be a dad. We got along well but our relationship was always more to him than it was to me. Where he sees a daughter and wants a daughter, I see a good man and someone who is a great spouse to my mom and is good to me, but does not fill the father role he wants to emotionally for me. Physically, he did. But emotionally I never felt like he was my dad and everyone in our lives is aware that I feel as though I have one dad and my stepdad is my stepdad.\n\nMy mom and stepdad are not paying or contributing to the wedding in any way. My fianc\u00e9 and I both have savings and we're putting those into the wedding. Though our wedding will be smallish since we want to prioritize other things.\n\nMy mom and stepdad say I am rude and heartless for turning down the offer.

Number one is he wants to do this badly and he's a good man so there's nothing wrong with him that would be a reason to say no. The other thing is I know this is just another rejection in his eyes and while it is a rejection of him as being \"my dad\" I know that will hurt him greatly.

While I can definitely sympathize with him, he is making your wedding about himself. He may be a good man, but he's definitely very selfish in this particular case. Stand your ground, it is your wedding. Your dad must have been amazing and I am sure he'll want you to be happy on that day (and every other day).", "Being a stepparent is truly a thankless job.  You're NTA but I really feel for your step-dad.", "NAH \n\nCan you do anything to acknowledge your stepdad at the wedding? A special dance, a toast, have him read a poem? I don\u2019t know but something to acknowledge his role in your life for years and that he tried his best?", "NTA - one thing my wife and I learned from our wedding is that no one should feel pressured to do anything or invite anyone they don't want to your wedding (especially since you are footing the bill). It sounds like atepdad is a little disappointed, and I know your mother is upset, but newsflash it isn't their wedding it's your wedding and your day. Maybe explain to stepdad that you think he is a good man, good husband etc. but you are walking alone as a way to honor your father? Or say fuck it and just tell them that's how it's going to be. To reiterate don't let anyone pressure or bully you, it's your day and weddings and planning don't need extra stress and b.s. added on to it.", "NAH but this post I will be honest shows once again why step parents don\u2019t like to invest emotionally in stepchildren.", "NTA - I was in a similar boat when I was younger. I don't have a good relationship with my biological father, but my stepfather is a wonderful man. \nWhen him and my mother married they gave me the option to take his last name (I currently have my mother's last name). I said I needed time to think. He took me aside afterwards and told me, \"no matter what name you want, I will always be there for you if you need me.\" \nIt has been nearly twenty years since they married, this father's day was the first I ever rang him unprompted to say thank you and that I had caught the Pokemon he wanted in the newest game that he couldn't catch so we could trade. \nIt took us more than two decades for him to take the role of father in my heart. And not once did he ever try to pressure me into it. \nI empathize with the feeling of no one being able to ever fill the role of father. Our circumstances differ in that mine understood the patience needed to overcome that barrier. \nI heard him cry for the first time on that call. Not only because for the first time I reached out to him, but also because he has never felt the connection to his own father to do that also. \nIt is obvious yours also harbours some pain. But you are not the arsehole, and no one has the right to make you feel so. I hope you have a wonderful wedding day, and as you walk down that aisle know how strong you are.", "What does it mean that he physically filled his role as stepfather but not emotionally?", "NTA. But i feel really sorry for your stepdad", "NTA.  Honestly I get both sides.  He has tried to be the dad and sounds like the emotional connection never happened.  That being said, I see why he would be sad and hurt that he is being absolutely excluded.  I almost want to say can you throw him a bone and do a separate dance with him, I do feel bad for someone who has tried so hard.", "NAH You can choose to have your wedding whichever way you are comfortable. But as a parent I can understand why he would be upset. I think most people severely underestimate how much their parents have done for them until they parent themselves. It must hurt to know that the child you would die for doesn\u2019t really care too much.", "I feel a bit torn. You say he\u2019s a nice man and he filled the role physically. I respect you lost your dad and you remember and love him. Maybe it would be nice if you could also show your stepdad in some way on your wedding day how his support helped you become the woman you are today. It sounds like he tried to be there in all the ways you needed. \n\nObviously I don\u2019t know your life from this one small snippet so you are ultimately the one that knows what\u2019s right for you and I wish you the best for your future.", "NAH but I feel for your step-dad", "YTA. I really feel for him. Yes it\u2019s your bloody day, and ffs have it your way. You have plenty of people giving you the NTAs.  He was your father figure and truly cares for you. Catering to the dead is not a loyalty thing, it\u2019s a sign you really haven\u2019t stopped grieving. Having him walk you down the aisle is not a disloyal act against your father. I smh at the thought that weddings are start to finish all about the bride (and sometimes the groom) and what they alone want versus being a familial celebration. I think it\u2019s very cold hearted of you.", "NTA. I feel for your stepdad, but it is your day. \n\nAnother option could be both your mum and stepdad walk you down the aisle?", "NTA. It's your wedding. You're paying. But...I kind of get where step dad is coming from. It will send a signal whether it should, or shouldn't. It seems like you're fixated on making this about missing your dad and subconsciously you're hurting your stepdad, who, from your own words, has been good to you. Isn't there some role or way you could include him?", "Yes.\n\nAny man that treats a child who isn't his own like his own, is an absolute champion.\n\nYou treating him like that for no reason? Yeo you're the asshole.", "YTA\n\nHe raised you, he's a good man, he gave the most he could.\nOne wishes more epople were able to step up in a parent role like he did.\nYour choice is a petty one", "NAH - \n\nAwww, I feel so sad for your stepdad. This is all around so sad. There is someone there willing to give you unconditional love but your heart is not open to it. You probably never will be open to it but I hope one day you are because to have someone truly love you and you love them is really a lovely thing and something some people can only wish for. It's in addition to your dad not to replace him at all.\n\nBut if you don't feel that kind of love for him and don't want him to walk you down the aisle, then don't. Yes, it will send a message to the guests but there's nothing you can do about that. It is what it is. You can't force love.", "Your feelings that you have one father are legitimate and valid, completely understandable. \n\nBut you are the only child that he got to parent and I understand how it must hurt him to be rejected. \n\nNAH", "NTA because it's your choice but I feel really bad for your stepfather .... it's not your fault or responsibility but poor guy! Lost his wife and unborn child, lost his ability to be a father in the future and spent years trying to be accepted as one by the child he helped raising just to be denied over and over again. He must really love you and your mother!", "NAH.  Since you wanted your mom to walk you down the aisle, was it ever considered to let them both walk you together? That could be a third option, unless you simply don\u2019t want him involved at all.", "Unpopular opinion I guess but I do think YTA and making a huge thing out of something very simple - you lost your dad when you were a child and you were lucky enough to be given another person who took care of you and raised you. Why do you have to make it a point, on your wedding day for everyone to see, that this man never filled the spot in your heart that you still reserve for your dad and that you never \"emotionally connected\" to him? So what? He filled that role anyway and gave you all his love, and he even told you it would mean the world for him to walk you down the aisle. Can you not find ANY gratefulness in your heart at all? Your long-winded story sounds to me as if you actually enjoy some of the heartbreak you have caused him in the past and are causing him now - what for? What's the big deal? You think your dad is going to look down on you walking yourself to the altar on your wedding day and thinking \"Yes, that's my girl, glad she doesn't acknowledge that guy who made sure she was OK after I had to leave her too early..\"?? I really can't grasp how you can reject your family like that. Because that's what your stepdad is.", "NAH, but my sympathy is with your step-dad. He did everything he could and you just never opened your heart to him. \n\nMy stepson likes to say he has multiple hearts, one for each of his four parents. Love is not finite. He isn't your dad, but he could have been special in his own important role. I get at 10 you're just a kid, but you really lucked out with him as a step-dad and it sucks he's being shown how little he means. \n\nYour mom married a man who treated you as his own and she's just protecting her spouse from the blow you're dealing. I don't blame her. \n\nBut it is your wedding and you feel the way you feel. You shouldn't do anything that makes you uncomfortable.", "I totally get what you\u2019re saying and of course you are entitled to every feeling here. But it\u2019s also a little sad. I had a wonderful step dad and my dad. I danced with each of them at my wedding. My step dad was wonderful to me and it\u2019s ok to recognize your step dad for the important role he has had in your life. Maybe you could have a dance with him to recognize that. I suspect your dad would have been happy someone so loving cared so much about you growing up. He doesn\u2019t have to replace your dads love but maybe you could allow him to be someone who just loves you like a dad.", " NTA and while I feel badly that your stepdad is hurting, and lost so much in his life, it\u2019s your wedding and your choice.", "This one is complicated. \n\nYes. You are an AH. But I don\u2019t think I can vote YTA. \n\nNAH. Be nice to your stepdad.", "I guess I\u2019m the outlier here. YTA. You would not dishonor your father by having your stepdad walk you down the aisle. He knows he can never replace your father but it would honor him for the years of support he\u2019s given you.", "NAH - my heart breaks for your stepdad but it\u2019s not your responsibility to fill the void in his life. Hope you have a great day.", "YTA. Maybe NAH, but honestly life is full of little concessions for those we love so YTA OP. \n\nYou had your first (bio) dad for seven years. You might remember a few things before five and several things between 5&7 but in essence, you\u2019re choosing a rose colored image of a person over a very real and very much here person.\n\nYou\u2019ve had your second (step) dad in your life for 17 years versus 7 (the large majority of which you likely have no memory of) years with your first. In all reality your step dad is your father. That\u2019s who was there through the majority of your life. You say he was a good man who tried to be their for you as much as possible but you held up a barrier. Stop punishing a good man for not being the super dad of your imagination. Because as harsh as this may seem, memories are extremely fallible (I suggest doing your own research) and while I\u2019m sure your dad really was great, he wasn\u2019t perfect. No one is. \n\nYou are SO lucky to have a man who wants to love and support you in a fatherly role. Be grateful. To shun the man who stepped up and was actually there for someone who couldn\u2019t be is insanely insensitive. If you don\u2019t care about him then sure, don\u2019t include your stepdad. But if you do care for him, include him. Stop looking at is at a reminder of what you DON\u2019T have and look at is a beautiful example of what you DO have. \n\nI don\u2019t care if I get downvoted. OP I would rather internet strangers disagree with me, than have you damage an important relationship in your life. You came here for an objective answer, not an echo chamber, so here you go.", "Yep. You are an asshole. You slap every good step dad in the face. Beyond asshole.", "In my opinion, everyone is the AH here. \n\nYour mom and SD for pushing the issue on your big day. Your day = your rules.\n\nYou because you acknowledge he is a good man and I bet you benefitted from having him in your life, even if you don't see him as your dad. If you said he constantly harassed you and didn't support you in any way. It would be easy to understand but it ends up sounding like you just kicked him in the nuts.", "YTA - you can do whatever you want. But this man was in your life more than your dad. I feel like you love the memory of your father and you literally throw step dad to the side because your dad wasn't there. So the fact you denied it on both because of something you couldn't control. I honestly cannot imagine doing this to yourself and step dad. I mean this is honestly showing how it goes priority wise in your life.", "This will be anecdotal and i know isnt indicative of the relationship everyone has with their stepparents, but from someone who had a similar childhood and relationship with their birth parent, YTA.\n\nI had a similar feeling that you did, you missed the parent that wasn't there, the parent that you only have good memories of, and the thought of replacing them in a special moment seems unheard of, but just think for one minute. Would your dad be happy with the man your mom chose to marry, the man who from your post seems to be a pretty good dude. Would he want you to walk alone down the aisle or show some grace/love and walk with this man. \n\nI know I don't speak for you, but it could be an opportunity to show an immense amount of kindness to a person who has shown you that kindness for almost 20 years of your life.", "YTA-  you say this man tragically lost his wife and daughter.  He was good to you.  But you\u2019ve spent your whole life clinging to the idea of your bio dad.  I get that it was traumatic to you, but he\u2019s not there and stepdad is.  What a small, lovely gesture it would be to allow him to walk you down the aisle.  You are being selfish and childish-  yes, it\u2019s your day but you can expect this to put a strain on the relationships you two have.", "NTA. BUT not everyone gets a stepdad like yours, who's willing to love you as his own daughter. It's sad really, that his role in your life is only to be a giver (both love and money) while still being treated like the 3rd wheel by his SD.", "Respectfully, I don't think OP is TA but I think that you are allowing a valuable moment and bonding experience between you and your step father to be destroyed over your emotional unavailability. I understand that their is a heavy emotional toll that comes with the death of a father or any family member or close friend, but understanding from an adult perspective, your step-father willingly went into a relationship with your mother, who at the time was a widowed single mother with a 9 y/o child. Although it might not have been what you wanted at the time or even now he still took on your family as his responsibility and tried his best knowing that his step daughter would have endless amounts of emotional baggage. Your step-father, although going into the relationship he knew what he was signing up for and you as the child even if you have no actual responsibility to show any actual affection or appreciation for him, he tried and played an active role in an attempt to be a father figure in your life. I personally think that you are taking what you have for granted over something as small as walking down an aisle, I think that over anything that your father would have been grateful that someone was there to take care of you and made sure that if anything went wrong you'd always have a roof over your head and a home to come back to. I think that men understand that a good man does not come easily and the fact that you have had 2 strong and inspiring men play a father figure role in your lifetime is an incredible feat that shouldn't be taken for granted. People who show you unconditional love and devotion for years on end with no real return and would do anything for year simply out of their love for you are so rare in this world, you especially OP should know this after losing your father and knowing that no one could replace him, and the fact that someone really tried to take up your burden and treat you as family, offering multiple times to adopt you so that you could feel included and truly loved, wanting to walk you down the aisle on your wedding day etc, I think that it is a shame that you would let a bond that could be so beautiful be ruined because you are only ready for love in intimacy and not love unconditionally. OP is NTA and neither is step-father, I hope you can make a decision that will satisfy you because at the end of the day it is your life and you will have to continue to live it.", "Sounds like your stepdad tried to be a good dad to you and I can understand why he\u2019s disappointed but also I understand that it\u2019s your wedding\u2026. This may affect your relationship with him, and you have to decide if that\u2019s a concern for you or not", "NAH, it is just sad you couldn't bond with him as much as he wanted", "He's been in your life for 17 years and is a decent person. He offered to adopt you several times, you declined. He offered to walk you down the aisle, you declined. He wants to dance with you, you declined. Frankly, I don't think you like him very much. Liking him is all that is required to decide to have a dance, nothing more. And so, you're willing to dance with your grandma, because you like her. If only everyone could be so lucky to have a parent who tries so hard. Imagine if you wanted all of those things, wanted to be adopted, wanted to be walked down the aisle, and he refused, how small would that make you feel? I feel sorry for your step-dad. He thinks of you as a daughter and gets nothing but rejection regardless of circumstance. I understand grieving for your bio-dad but it's been 20 years, it's time to move on and allow your heart to heal enough that it isn't standing in the way of the relationships you still have. None of that requires ever forgetting your bio-dad.

With that said, it's not the job of a child to fill the gap in his life. (Offering multiple times to adopt you and have your name changed. Ick. Dude - let it go.)

It's your wedding and you don't owe anyone a place or role in it.  Nor do you owe your stepdad the place in your heart that belongs to your father.\n\nHowever, the hurt feelings of your stepdad (and your mom, by extension) are fully understandable.  He both feels the grief of his own loss and a sense of rejection from never quite gaining acceptance as a father.

You can also want to walk yourself for some feminism reason if you want. This is your day. You do you. (I absolutely don\u2019t want to say that women who share this moment with their dad ain\u2019t feminist, just that you don\u2019t have to walk the aisle with a man who agree to give you to another man. Everyone can do as they please). So you shouldn\u2019t have to justify yourself. And making your wedding about himself isn\u2019t nice at all. He will walk down the aisle with his wife, give a toast.

I never told my kids my preference, they just did what they wanted.", "NTA. But have you considered walking down the aisle w the groom? In my country the father of the bride does not give his daughter away, she is not his property. The bride and groom walk down the aisle, proceeding together towards the altar and their future. Which l think is lovely.", "Whilst he\u2019ll be upset you could probably turn that frown upside down when or if you give a little speech.

He wants to feel for the first time like a real father to you and he wants to not feel ashamed because someone else is dancing with you. Those are his issues, not yours.

He's just trying to guilt you into giving himself an ego boost.\n\nYou do what's best for you! Especially since you feeling with dishonor your father and have your stepfather walk you down the aisle.\n\nThat being said, I think you could have explained it to your stepfather a little bit better so that he wouldn't have been his hurt. Instead of saying that's not on the table, I think you could have just said \"I would only want my father to do it and since he's not here I'd rather have no one to it, and I wouldn't feel comfortable having someone replace him.\" \n\nI think that would help him to feel better because he would see that it's not you rejecting him it simply you want to go honor your father.

As a dad, myself, if I were going to pass, when my children were seven, I would be thrilled to know that a good guy would step in to my family\u2019s life and be a good person. I would even go so far as to say, let the guy walk down the aisle. But that\u2019s me I agree, that it\u2019s your wedding your choice. But statistically speaking, there\u2019s a better chance that the stepdad will be around in 10 years, then the new husband will.

He is gone and no amount of rejecting this man on such a personal level, especially after all he has done for  you that he was under no obligation to do, can change that.

Yes, because this is Reddit, and someone will always deliberately misinterpret your words to start an argument!\n\nThere are so many posts all over Reddit from people who have lost a parent early in childhood, either permanently through bereavement, or as good as through abandonment, or who have just been kept away from one of their parents, see less of one due to divorce. \n\nThey don't have loving, caring stepparents. At best, they might have overbearing or cold stepparents. At worst, they might have abusive stepparents of the very worst kind.\n\nI do think that OP's mum and stepdad messed up when she was younger by not addressing this together as a family. They should have tried to get some family therapy, or at least bought some books or done some reading on how best to introduce a new stepparent to a child whose other parent has died. \n\nThe 'bonus parent' who is an addition, not, never, ever, a replacement is such a simple and effective approach, it seems so obvious when you think about it but so many couples in this situation fail to use it!\n\nAnd her stepdad, I think, probably needed, still needs individual therapy with someone who has experience in grief counselling, due to his repeated insistence on adoption as a way of replacing the family he could never have back, or have again.\n\nWhat may be happening here, and he might not even realise it himself, on a conscious level, is that his latent grief means that he has a desperate yearning deep inside him that he needed OP to help him fill. \n\nBut that's not her job, and it's not fair to ask that of her now, and it certainly wasn't fair to ask that of her as a child!\n\nHowever, OP, I do believe that, you probably care about your stepdad, perhaps you might need to give yourself permission to admit that to yourself - it wouldn't be betraying your wonderful Dad to do so!\n\nIf that is the case, then be kind. Acknowledge the love and support that he has given you and allow him to dance with you, perhaps? \n\nWhy can't you dance with him and your grandmother both? There should be a way to make this work! I don't know how old and spry she is? Is she in her 60s or 80s or even older? If she has any mobility issues then she may not be able to dance for an entire song, so perhaps she could start dancing  with you to a slower song and then your stepdad could cut in, elegantly, at a prearranged point, as the DJ crossafades or the band switches to something more upbeat.\n\nYou can also acknowledge both your Dad and your stepdad as being equally loving, caring, and supportive but fulfilling slightly different roles for you in your speech.\n\nWhat would your Dad have wanted for you to have after he was gone? Wouldn't it have been someone who obviously cares as much for you as your stepdad? Again, you can love him, be loyal to him, and also love your stepdad for being a great stepdad. You can have room in your heart for both of them, but you have to give yourself the permission to do so first. \n\nThere's so much for you to think about here, OP, I don't think that you should rush into any decisions about the wedding yet, not when they have so much potential to hurt those close to you, even though that's not your intention.\n\nI think that you and your family need to sit down and talk properly, not about the wedding but about how all of you feel, probably with a therapist, or some other neutral party, as that may be the only way that they will give you the space to be heard and listen to you fully. It's too easy sometimes for parents (or anyone who's the other party) to hear the first phrase or sentence that you say as an attack on them and stop listening to the rest, or even interrupt and to start to talk over you!\n\nA neutral space with a mediator, who doesn't necessarily have to be a therapist, if you have a trusted family member such as an aunt, that understands your point of view but is also trusted by your parents, might be what you need to at least kick off the process of all of you listening to each other and understanding how each other feels right now and has felt in the past.\n\nThe goal of this initial discussion would simply be for your mum and stepdad to accept that there is a problem, not to reach any kind of resolution! Neither side should have high expectations. It might take a lot of work and a long time on both sides to really untangle all the knots, probably some  before your wedding, enough to reach a peaceful compromise, but it will be a long term process for all of you.\n\nI will say, though, please don't judge your mum and stepdad too harshly! As parents (well-intentioned, good-hearted ones only here), we're not given a manual when our kids are born. We are constantly just making things up as we go along. \n\nWe do make mistakes, we do fuck up and not just the little day to day stuff. Sometimes it's the big stuff and we only realise that we messed up with hindsight, when it's far too late to change what we did or said, when at the time we thought that we were doing the right thing, often based on what we knew at the time, sometimes during a difficult or stressful period of our lives.\n\nI know this was long, OP, but it was written with live and kindness.

The decision was made for two reasons. My dad died when I was 7 and he would be my number one choice if he were alive but he's not and two, my mom has made it perfectly clear that she would find it disrespectful to my stepdad if she walked me down the aisle and so would not do it. Given that both my parents are out and I don't want to ask my paternal grandparents to do too much, my grandma and I are already sharing a special dance, walking alone is what I feel the most comfortable doing.\n\nI could ask my stepdad and even when I contemplated my decision, I knew he would want to do it. But it would make me sad to have him walk me instead of my dad if I'm honest. I think my stepdad is a good man and he has tried his very best to be a dad for me. But I didn't want a dad when I lost mine. I wanted my dad. Nobody else was ever going to be able to fill that role in my heart.\n\nI asked my mom and stepdad if they would like to do a joint toast or two separate ones and whether they would like to walk down the aisle/dance to specific songs. While discussing this my stepdad asked who I would be walking with and I told him I was walking alone. He offered to do it and I said it was a lovely offer but I would walk alone. He pressed me on why and I said it felt like the best option. He said it would mean the world to him if he could do it, if just once he could feel like he's a real dad and not just second place to my dad. I told him I understood but it was not an option on the table.\n\nHe said he was already being shamed by having to watch me dance with my grandma when it should be a father/daughter dance. But to have everyone watch me walk alone when they know I have a stepdad is going to send a very big message. \n\nI know people will ask about details on our relationship, etc. I met my stepdad when I was 9 and he married my mom when I was 10. He offered to adopt me and give me his last name and I turned him down five times in the 8 years I lived with them. He was married before my mom and he lost his wife and unborn baby in an accident. He was also made sterile by the same accident. He always longed to be a dad. We got along well but our relationship was always more to him than it was to me. Where he sees a daughter and wants a daughter, I see a good man and someone who is a great spouse to my mom and is good to me, but does not fill the father role he wants to emotionally for me. Physically, he did. But emotionally I never felt like he was my dad and everyone in our lives is aware that I feel as though I have one dad and my stepdad is my stepdad.\n\nMy mom and stepdad are not paying or contributing to the wedding in any way. My fianc\u00e9 and I both have savings and we're putting those into the wedding. Though our wedding will be smallish since we want to prioritize other things.\n\nMy mom and stepdad say I am rude and heartless for turning down the offer.

He wanted to be a dad to me, but I was *really* traumatized by my mom's previous dating history and the \"dad\" roles in my life had been filled by my grandad and great grandad so I wasn't having it (I was 8 or 9 when we met and 10 when they had a shotgun wedding to prepare for my baby brother). \n\nLuckily I have a younger brother who really wanted a dad AND my stepdad and mom had their own kid together. he offered to adopt us and give us his last name (which I firmly refused, I have my grandad's last name.

Step dad could have done this. He could have been bitter and insisted that his step daughter would never replace the baby he lost.

But: as an adult you (ostensibly) learn to see the care givers in your life as actual people rather than people who are just there to serve your own ends and needs. To not acknowledge the love SD has given OP by not only being a part of creating a healthy home for herself and her mother, but also by physically being there for OP (emotionally too if she had wanted to) is OP:s right and I don\u2019t necessarily fault her. Personally though, if it was my dilemma to solve, I\u2019d feel cruel denying him this. Stepdad just wants his love and presence in her life acknowledged and respected in way that would mean so much to him - and on a day that is supposed to be about love, there can never be too much of it around. I would never make the choice OP has, couldn\u2019t just ignore my SD\u2019s legitimate feelings and the care he put into me.", "Correct.", "She offered him the opportunity to do a speech which would be as a parental figure, alongside her mum so she has tried to recognise that", "yeah, she has made it crystal clear that everything he has done for her means very little.

It doesn't have to be and shouldn't be a replacement for her dad. There's enough love out there and in our hearts to love multiple people at once without it affecting our love for anyone else.\n\nIf she said I really care for or love my stepdad but I think walking down the aisle is my dad's position. That would be different. Instead, OP has said she doesn't feel any attachment to him at all despite him being there for her since she was young. I think that is sad and that means she is not open to him because what more can he do besides be there for her and she feels indifferent toward him. \n\n\nBut you're absolutely right that he cannot force those things, which is what I said in my original comment.", "Personally I hated the idea of being given away and also of just the male parent doing the giving. I didn't like the idea of being handed off from one man to another. Moms play a big role too! My parents and husband's parents each walked down the aisle together, and then my husband and I walked down together. As far as I know everyone was happy with the arrangement. I'm just offering this as a different solution that would be slightly less frought.", "This would have been the best option imo.  You could offer this to them as both or neither, if this means this much to him, your mom wouldn\u2019t back out.  If she did, then you walk alone.  But it sounds like your mind up.\n\nDo you care about the message it sends? I ask because one possibility is that he gives a very thoughtful amazing toast, that touches on how proud he is of you and how great it was to watch you grow up and blah, blah, blah, which in turn makes you look like the A-H.  The speech is so eloquent that nobody can call him the A-H and to top it off, it\u2019s on one of the most special days of you life.", "10000%. I think her dad would have been happy that someone wanted to love her like that. Loving her step dad and giving him a special role doesn\u2019t mean she loves her bio dad less. It seems she\u2019s clinging to that feeling from her childhood. Like living the stepdad makes her \u201creal\u201d dad gone even more. That\u2019s just not how love works. Love can expand.

Seems she didn\u2019t learn that somewhere.", "Or maybe she just sees it as the father's role and this man is not her father? Its not that complicated. She is not obligated to treat this guy like her new daddy and give him to same space in her life as her dad just because he married her mom.", "It does seem as though she has offered him a place in the wedding. It may not be the most prominent but I can understand having no one walk her down the aisle might almost feel like giving a role to her dad.", "But he hasn't been her dad.

That's a role for the father figure in the bride's life and walking alone will be a massive announcement to everyone they know that stepdad is not a father figure and has no special place in the life of the child HE RAISED. It's treatment usually reserved for estranged parents or abusers.", "To understand it you have to understand how culture works and how emotions and the need to meet social expectations works.  You wouldn\u2019t understand.", "But that's not OP's reason, her reason is the slightly misogynistic idea that DNA equals parent", "I think its humiliating because the stepfather clearly has an idea in his head of how he wants the relationship to be. Unfortunately for him that isnt the case and he sees it as rejection and would be humiliating. Also depends on what family and friends know of the dynamic. If hes been telling people one thing and its not the truth he will now have to explain why.", "If that's how you feel then it seems like you know what you want to do, and if walking the aisle alone is what you want then go for it.

They were very correct that you aren't an asshole, but as a stepchild myself who is very close to my stepdad I just wanted to make sure you didn't accidentally do something that might not be able to be undone or possibly cause hurt you didn't mean to cause.

It is fine that OP does not want that of course.\n\nI do understand the wishes of OP somewhat, but boy - will she regret that decision in the future.

From the rest of the post, I thought that the conversation was had with her mom and stepdad together, but only the toast part actually pertained to him and OP. I was actually wondering why OP brought up the walk down the aisle while stepdad was there since she was so clear she didn't want to do it with him, but my friend pointed out that she may not have intended for him to be there when she was discussing it with her mom and the songs may have just been a playlist request offer for a song her mom and stepdad might want to dance to together.\n\nu/DiligentDefinition33, could you please explain what you were offering/talking to your mom and stepdad about when you were having this conversation?

You can do whatever you want in your wedding\u2026and should.  Your stepfather has shown that he loves you and healthy love from anyone is always a gift.

Doesn\u2019t matter that the step dad had one more year with OP. That would have no bearing if the parents pushed him as a dad when she was 10. That would have closed off those feelings and set her up for this relationship they have now. Step parents ruin their own chances by being pushy. If you push in the beginning it mean you will *never* get the relationship you want. Feel bad for the guy since he also has trauma and I bet he did come on too strong back then.

Oh, poor OP has too many people who love her. I mean, there are so many people out there who would kill to have someone step up to love them. Reddit does a terrible job at being like, yeah, you don't need that step-parent trying to love you! They need to get a clue. Instead of reminding posters that it's not an either/or scenario.

I know you said you\u2019re a father, and this is no means an insult to you as a person or a father, but I urge you to seriously step back and contemplate that not everyone will share the same sentiment on certain topics, maybe even your kids, and that\u2019s 100% okay:) let\u2019s put this to rest and you have a good day!", "There is a legal element to it. If you adopt a kid then you have to look after that child. So for example if you marry someone with a kid and adopt them, if you later divorce you legally will need to pay child support etc. I can be a method to ensure that should something unfortunate occur to the other parent you have a legal standing to see and look after the child.\n\nBut this all comes with the caveat that the child has to want this too. The fact he kept asking her says to me he was simply trying to fulfill a dream of his rather than doing what was best for her.", "I genuinely feel bad for you that you think that way.", "Of course, I read her post and comments, but he asked her when she was a child, and she might have changed her mind over the years.  He is not an evil man for wanting to adopt her or for asking her multiple times.  I get that she loves her dad, but he passed, and this man, her stepdad, has been there for her over the years.  I'm sorry, but what she is doing is a slap in the face to a man who has accepted her as his own.  She could walk down the aisle with her stepdad and have a photo of her birth dad with her on display.", "You\u2019re a hypocrite. He\u2019s worthy of a shout out? He\u2019s allowed to dance but not with you. He\u2019s allowed to make you look good in a speech but no meaningful symbolic participation is permitted. We get it. Your day. Blah, blah, blah. Crumbs for your step-dad. \nNice way to use tradition and a ceremony to publicly put everyone in their place.", "Of course there are merits to it, and I suspect the vast majority of people adopting children are doing it with primarily the child\u2019s interest at heart. But I do wonder about times like this where it feels like the potential \u201cadopter\u201d acts like they were robbed of the opportunity.", "He is being mentioned equal to my mom at my wedding. Literally they will be treated the very same as my mom on the day.", "Will you shut up please? OP doesn\u2019t consider him her dad, that\u2019s the end of it. He spend 5 years or 50 years as her step father, it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s OP\u2019s wedding day, her walk down the isle, she gets to decide who does it. She is mentioning him in her speech because she knows how much he helped her mom raise her, is a good person and is a good spouse. But he is not entitled to walk her down the isle."]}
