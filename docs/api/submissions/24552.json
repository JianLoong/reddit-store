It's important for your emotional health to set some boundaries here, so you know what to expect.\n\nI'm concerned about you going along with this so it's \"certain we would have the kids as planned\" -- is the ex keeping in terms of the custody arrangement?

Listen, you did not say, \"Hey lets do all vacations together going forward\"...you agreed to **ONE LAST** vacation; that was it. You already accommodate her for holidays to which I'd say you're already at champion 2nd wife status \ud83c\udfc6. I would say (in general) that most 2nd wives do not play at all with the ex wife, kids involved or not.   \n\n\nYou have already been more than gracious and understanding and I think you absolutely have the right to say, \"You know what, I'm not comfortable with this level of involvement\". It's called boundaries, something which I suspect your husband and his ex may struggle with, so it's going to be up to you to set them. Clearly.   \n\n\nDon't let anyone tell you it's not ok to say this. YOU are allowed to have feelings about this. YOU are included in this family too, so you should also be made to feel comfortable here. Unfortunately you're going to have to be the one in charge of that since hubby and ex aren't quite getting it.", "You do know that you are the mistress, right?", "No judgement issued but you need to COMMUNICATE with your fianc\u00e9 not confront him. This is not that he's doing something wrong but a conversation about figuring out shared boundaries not just imposing your boundaries on him. Also you need to get used to his ex being at any and all extended family events because she is part of the family. Divorce doesn't mean that your future in laws have to suddenly drop this person who they had welcomed into their family and clearly they've been continuing to include her for the past 6-7 years. You will not change this and you WBTA if you tried to.\n\n When it comes to family trips it's fine to want some without her but you have to understand that it might be nice for the kids to still have some trips with both their parents since it's amicable.\n\nAs for the kids not wanting to go on the trip, you didn't state their ages but considering the divorce happened 6-7 years ago I'd assume we're looking at pre teens and that's just how they are. Just because they're grumpy and would rather stay home doesn't mean that they won't end up making meaningful memories on the trip. They'd probably feel the same way if they were going with just you and your fianc\u00e9 so you can't be using this as a judgement toward the value of the trip.\n\nBasically you need to decide if you want to be part of this family dynamic because it sounds like it's working out fine for everyone but you. Small changes can happen but in general you need to weigh how much your specific concerns stack up against a good thing.", "NTA.\n\nUnless you talk **directly** to your fiance regarding the presence of his \"ex\" at family gatherings and vacations, this behavior will continue.\n\nYour fiance and his \"ex\" have unfinished business, and I'm not sure this will end well for you, OP.", "YTA here. They have kids together and are coparenting. If he wants to include her in trips with the kids and his family invite her to get togethers they are doing so for the kids and to continue an amicable family unit. You are definitely allowed to want to vacation with just your hubby and step kids, but it seems like he isn't on that same page. Don't get into a relationship with someone who has kids if you don't want that other parent around. Because to have a good relationship for the kids the other parent will likely need to be involved in events (even those not directly related to the kids) .", "Info: where is HER husband in all of this?\n\nAlso you said you're not a fan of hers because of \"how she treats the kids\". Is she mean? Neglectful? Does your fianc\u00e9 agree it's a problem?\n\nEx wife means EX. If it doesn't involve the kids, thus co-parenting, she shouldn't be there. Easier said than done if your fianc\u00e9 wants her there, but this will forever be an issue for you if you don't communicate and set boundaries. \n\nYou're NTA to bring this up with him.", "Definitely NTA.  There\u2019s no reason for her to be in your lives that often. Especially on occasions not pertaining to the kids. Absolutely bring it up and if it\u2019s a deal breaker, please make that clear.  Better to be on the same page before the \u201cI do\u2019s\u201d", "We've had some issues during past holidays. We try to make it so both families get to celebrate with the kiddos on agreed days/times. My family and his tend to plan far in advance, but his ex wife is a very last minute planner. \n\nSince he wants to avoid conflict with her, she basically always gets her way which has led to me attending family functions alone in past when she, at the last minute, decided to keep the boys at the same time. It puts me in a pickle as well, because my family in general is VERY important to me, but family includes him and the boys, so having to choose between them and my parents/sister/grandparents/nephew/etc. is always very hard. It leads to a lot of guilt on my end when I've already promised to be in one place. Thus, deciding to do holidays together.", "Ya absolutely, this keeps up there is no doubt they will end up sleeping together again at some point.", "He doesn't say much of anything and really just goes along with what's planned. He's a super nice guy and, knowing her personality, it may be that he just wants to avoid conflict. I'm not really sure what goes on behind the scenes or how he really feels, unfortunately, so I can't fully answer this. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 has mentioned that there were definitely issues at first with her husband disliking a lot of what was going on, so idk if he's just decided this is normal and moved on, or if he's just decided to keep it to himself.", "How?", "This needs to be the top comment.  You\u2019re a part of a blended family.  Your spouse and ex are co-parents and are putting their kids first as they should by doing joint events.  It shows the kids a united front.  As spouses of the parents it\u2019s important for you and the ex\u2019s spouse to participate.  However, I do agree with you that there should be some boundaries in place.  A solution based conversation with your spouse is in order not a confrontation.", "Did you read the post? The part where she bought him gifts and whatnot? Being civil with an ex is fine but her feelings are valid to have a relationship with her fianc\u00e9e without her involved...", "They are her kids so you don't get to decide to take them to your family events and cut her out. Don't try to play house with someone else's kids and expect that to be accepted.", "I don\u2019t think they are gonna GUARANTEED sleep together, but I am saying that they like each other still.", "I would honestly have a sit down with your fianc\u00e9 about how you are feeling. I would feel a type of way if I was trying to do things with my husband and one of his ex's was constantly inserting herself.", "Mistress with a ring. She is banging the husband; but has no say in family matters or any decisions. Husband and ex decide all holidays and vacations, etc.", "She can talk about expectations and that might involve setting a limit around gifts, but she doesn't want the ex to attend his family's events or do joint vacations. Some things need to be discussed, some she doesn't get to decide solo. The ex is still a part of the kids' lives and his family's life.", "We're trying to make it so BOTH families (hers and his) get to see the kids. My family and his celebrate together. Not sure where you got that I'm trying to cut her out, but when we have agreed upon days/times and she changes that at the last minute, it's a problem. They're HIS kids too, not just hers.", "Thats playing with fire, especially on a week vacation in Mexico together... OP's feelings are completely valid", "A mistress is someone who enters a marriage as a third party effectively destroying the marriage. This does not appear to be the case here", "You are missing the point. They were discussing a family vacation and her fianc\u00e9e invited he EX without her consent. You don't see a problem with that? Its one thing to be civil for a family dinner or something, but to be invited on a whole vacation without your partners permission? When you spend years of your life with someone you don't just lose all feelings for them once you separate... they are playing with fire here and OP is going with her gut feeling.", "To be clear, I have no problem with general holiday celebrations together - I was actually the one who decided it would be easier to invite her for those. But a party specifically celebrating my fianc\u00e9's birthday just does not feel like an appropriate occasion to invite his ex wife to. Any other general family party? Sure. \n\nI do appreciate your insight though. I've never dealt with divorce in my family and don't know what is or isn't normal.", "They can have a conversation but if he wants this kind of relationship with the ex, they may be incompatible. And she's TA for trying to dictate what family events the ex can attend.", "It's the kids' dad and mom. Do they want her excluded? His parents invited her. Maybe they don't want to impact the coparenting relationship.", "No, she's not lol. It is her life too. If she wants a vacation with HER husband and his kids and ONLY her husband there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.", "Nothing is wrong with it, but they aren't on the same page and she doesn't get to executively decide.", "Yes, she does. This is a fair ultimatum. His ex came to his birthday party for him... not his kids. Weird but tolerable if they are remaining friends. If she does not want her future husband's EX wife on her vacation then she absolutely has the right to make that call. Even to go as far as her or me. \n\nIf my wife's EX wanted to hang out with her I would absolutely not be ok with it... would you?", "She can say that she doesn't like that and they can be incompatible, but if he wants to maintain the relationship with his kids' mom that's not wrong. She doesn't get to set the rules for everyone's interactions with the kids' mom.", "It isn't about the kids, she came to HIS birthday party. They were also planning a trip together and he invited his ex. He absolutely should have consulted with his future wife. Maintaining a relationship is one thing, having her tag along while you make your own memories with him is completely different. Would be an absolute dealbreaker for me and 95% of other married people..."]}
