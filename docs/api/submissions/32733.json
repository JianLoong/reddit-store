You paid him back right away and he told you he was going out anyway. He's the one that's selfish here.", "NTA your friend doesn't sound like a freind. Sounds like he's just in this friendship for what benefits him.", "NTA- You asked him to pick up food you are willing to pay for while he is out getting himself food. This is not even an imposition. \n\nI am curious, however, why you be to everyone in your family that you are ordering food?", "NTA. \n\nyou paid for the food and such and you had clear reasoning as to why you couldn\u2019t get it yourself. i\u2019ve had friends drop off food for me or grab it if they are on their way and it hasn\u2019t been an issue. they clearly don\u2019t think of you the same way you think of them so i would drop them as soon as possible.", "NTA you had a very good reason to ask a minor favour- your friend mentioned he was already picking up food- unless he lacked funds to pay for yours, he is absolutely unkind and unreasonable to react this way.", "NTA.\n\nHe was already picking up food for himself and you offered to pay for yours. I don't understand why he was annoyed.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you often cook or buy food for friends who are coming over? You weren't able to do that so he was picking up food for himself on the way to hang out with you? \n\nUnless he'd already ordered/paid/etc, I can't see how it was any extra effort for him to get you some food as well, esp if you'd be paying him back for your part. \n\nI see in your responses to other comments that he's usually a kind person and a good friend, so it's definitely worth a conversation with him about it but like. Unless there's some big piece of this story you're leaving out I feel like he's being very unreasonable with his anger at you and is maybe taking advantage of what you're willing to provide to friends without wanting to reciprocate any effort on his end.", "have today's children learnt no more decency? you help yourself out and going shopping is not the end of the world... but what can i say - i'm a bit older and was a child in the last millennium  \n\n\nNTA - but thats not your friend... sry to say that", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When people show you who they are, believe them. I hope you heal quickly. Then go find better friends.", "NTA this \u201cfriend\u201d was already stopping for food.  It took no extra effort to grab you something.  You said you\u2019d pay him back.  He\u2019s being rude and uncaring about the situation.", "Nta", "He is not the OP\u2019s friend.", "He justified it with a mild fog, idk he is normally a good friend, so I am not sure what to think", "I asked him a bit more, his reasoning was that I should have ordered food for him and me at the first place - when I tried to explain that\u2019s not how things work at my household", "He is a good friend normally, I think I\u2019ll have a serious talk with him", "It\u2019s an odd rule basically my mum is in charge of delivery related things and she gets annoyed when there are unexpected deliveries so we schedule everything in advance", "I think it might be a cultural issue, he is a good friend and supportive usually \nI was just raised in a quite close knit jewish family , and I am quite collectivist and am often at odds with my peers because of it", "My friend, you have to realize is it pointless to generalize an entire generation of people based off of one internet post, particularly one where everyone agrees the friend was in the wrong. \n\nOf course people still help out their friends. This one guy being an asshole doesn't change that", "That\u2019s very strange.", "NTA this is very odd. If I get an invite to someone's house when they're injured, etc, the default thing to do is ask \"want me to get you anything on the way?\". Totally normal behaviour to do. \n\nIt's very strange for someone who is a friend to get annoyed with doing you a very small favour.", "This... This is wack... Your friend is wack. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\u2026and stop studying with this friend.  I really don\u2019t get how, since he was already getting food for himself, while coming over to your place to study, it was so difficult to get you some food as well?  Food that you even offered to pay for? What?  He was just going to eat in front of you? What would he have been out of by doing g this for you?   And you have done this for him before?   He is not a friend.  You do not need this type of person in your life.  Friends help each other.  Friends think of each other.  Especially when one friend is down and out.", "NTA. What kind of shit friend is that? If it's out of his way by a far bit then I'd understand but if not and he's already getting food then literally no reason to be shitty about it", "NTA, You weren't asking too much. He is mildly infuriated just because you gave him a little bit of work. Its not even that he had to pay for it (well, technically he had to), you were gonna pay it back. He is yelling at you for nothing.", "NTA your friend sounds like a dick", "NTA\n\nIce hockey team in New South York Stadium.", "Maybe it's a cultural thing, maybe it's just in my area or maybe it's just me and the people I know but when we go visit someone who is laid up we always call and ask if there is anything we can pick up for them.  NTA.", "Nta. Doesn't seem like a very good friend.", "This right here, OP.  The extra detail makes the difference for me.\n\nHe wasn't actually upset to pick up food for you, too-*he was mad that you asked to pick up food for you and didn't offer to pay for his, too*.  If you ordered delivery, you would have paid for it.  I don't see any mention anywhere of friend ever paying for any of the food, delivery or homemade.  \n\nHe's spoiled by the fact you always provide food and was probably expecting when he came over you'd provide again, despite everything you're going through.  And if you couldn't physically do it, you'd just buy it for him.\n\nIdk, maybe less of a friend and more of a mooch?  Possibly not in every way, but at least in the expectations of food and coming over.\n\nYou're NTA, but your buddy seems pretty entitled.  Not a friendship ender necessarily, but personally I'd want a little space myself if it were possible for a while.  It's pretty generous and a good host to provide food for every guest every time, and I guess I'd feel a little taken advantage of; but that's just my take.", "What do you mean it's not the way things work in your house", "Is he normally a good friend, or an entertaining leech? There is a difference...", "If he\u2019s getting food fir himself, he can pick up food for you. Complaining about that is not a friendly act. \n\nI\u2019d have offered, but that\u2019s me. \n\nAnd you should have a discussion with your family about rules because being injured _should_ give you a break from family rules, unless the rules are \u2018ask to see whether anyone else wants some\u2019.", "Are you sure?", "This is a little odd.\n\nNext time you are expecting a friend, explain to your mom that you will be ordering a delivery so that she can be prepared and schedule it. I think that will go a long way to helping the situation.", "That is super odd. I would be very confused by this if I was your friend."]}
