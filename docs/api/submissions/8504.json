They're Pokemon cards at the end of the day and they were traded by the kids.\n\nYWNBTA", "NTA. A trade is a trade. And honestly the card is probably not worth as much you think because of the condition of it being out of the pack and traded. It could also be a fake.", "NTA, well played Team Rocket!\n\n(Jk, this is just how trading goes sometimes)", "NTA-Your son didn\u2019t cheat anyone. The trade was done sincerely.", "NTA. Professional card buyer and seller here, mostly pokemon actually. Everyone has a bad beats story from trading the wrong card. This kid just got his. You CAN advise the kid and family, could be a cool teachable moment for you and your kid if you want to go down that route, trading and equity and all that. But kid traded the card. Personally, I would get the card framed as the best trade your child will ever make in their life.", "NTA.  The trade was made when the traders had equal knowledge of the value of the cards.  Son discovered after the fact that one of the cards had greater value than either of them knew.  There is no obligation to share that information with anyone.  You found out because of son's innocence.   IMO son should be allowed to keep the cards he trades for.   If the others don't take the same interest in value as he does, he should bear the fruits of his labor.  Trading is a business issue, not a morality issue.   Just my thoughts.  You decide.  I hope you decide in favor of your son.", "NAH. I really don't know what the correct option here is. Your kid traded it fairly, no stealing involved, so I wouldn't say you have to give it back. But I think it really depends on what you personally want to do. If your child just wants to keep it for his collection, then absolutely keep it. If he wants to sell it though, then it might be a bit iffy to not give it back. NAH either way though. Do what you think is right here. Remember just to think about what your teaching your child though.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like this was a fair trade your son did.", "Well, you might be legally obliged to do so. People who say \"a trade is a trade\" forget that kids that age are usually not considered able to make trades in that price class. For example, where I live, a kid could trade a 5 buck card, but not the one you mentioned. They can buy comics, but not I phones. So you really should look into the legal situation here.\nNot to mention the social fallout this could create for your son.", "Man forget about the other parents, get your money!", "NTA, but you have a huge teachable moment here.  If you  arrange to meet with the other child and his parents in front of your child, explain the situation and offer to return the card, your child will watch integrity in action.", "I think ywbta if you didn\u2019t let the other parents know. A lot of parents don\u2019t know these cards can hold a decent amount of value. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019d want to know if your child accidentally traded a card worth a few thousand right?", "NTA It\u2019s his/your card now, do with it what you will", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good to teach your child to be devious, but I think it\u2019s fair to keep the card and teach your son that you shouldn\u2019t trade things that you a) don\u2019t know the value of b) will be missed. If you tell the parents this could get really ugly in unexpected ways. If they show so little interest in their kids hobbies that they let them trade such value cards, then they are also at fault", "NTA Make sure the card is kept safely and not bent or damaged. Lookup online how to do this, as that with DRASTICALLY change the value from very high to like 200$.\n\nYou'll have to send it away to have it graded (appraised for quality and condition) and put into a case. Then auction it off online.\n\nBuy more cards for your kiddo and put some extra $ in his education fund.", "If my info is correct: The prices probably are for mint or near mint cards, means: just touched once and put directly into a folder.\nIf the card looks like it was played (which i would assume because kids) it's not nearly worth as much.\n\n\nNTA - kids don't care about collecting cards this way & they did a trade which seems valuable to both of them.", "NTA but think a minute. If the roles were reversed what would you want to have happen?", "NTA but your son might be one. \n\nDifficult situation, if your son traded some cards knowing that he was ripping off his friends I think that you have to discuss with him the moral problem this situation causes. Basically, if the trade was fair I don't really see the problem but the game should stay just a game and not a business for your child. Obviously, the money from your son's cards should stay with him maybe for his college tuition in the future.", "Haha \"not well off\" with \"kind\" grandparents that can afford a private school comes across as kind of well off. Anyhow, keep it.", "Imagine this kind of stuff happening in the sports world. LA Lakers dropping to the bottom of the NBA, New Orleans Pelicans drafting Victor Wembanyama, and he ends up being even better than expected and the Pelicans come over to the Lakers and say, \"Hey remember that pick? Yeah he was even better than thought, did you know this was going to be the draft this year?\" Of course not. Those trades are final once they're made. There's no going back unless both teams agree to another trade. \n\nPokemon cards are the same way. NTA. Sucks they lost out on that, but you're not obligated to tell them anything. That was a fair trade, your son just unknowingly finessed them.", "Exactly, if the parents had paid the full value of the card originally. then I could see there being an issue, but if the kid just traded cards they got in a packet, no one lost money.", "My husband had a rare shiny charazard card that was out of the pack and traded. It's worth \u00a3250,000 problem, is, he kept it \"safe\"  in a bible, and his mum threw away the bible.", "Exactly. If you're worried about losing an expensive card don't let your nine year old trade them unsupervised.", "To be blunt, a card that has been in a kid\u2019s collection and passed around is not likely to be worth the top dollar. My daughter has a few rare cards. But the value is much less than the highest grade values because the cards have to be absolute mint to have real value.", "Also would the card be his? Or would you keep it and sell it?", "If you read it, OP said their son did research on the card he traded and saw it was worth a lot. So, no the son isn\u2019t an AH.", "True. Even if it\u2019s not worth a few thousand I\u2019m sure anyone would want to know if their kid just gave away even a few hundred for free basically.", "He literally said the kid didn't know it was worth a lot but knew it was a good card with good stats."]}
