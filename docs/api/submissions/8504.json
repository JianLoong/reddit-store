And honestly the card is probably not worth as much you think because of the condition of it being out of the pack and traded. It could also be a fake.", "NTA, well played Team Rocket!\n\n(Jk, this is just how trading goes sometimes)", "NTA-Your son didn\u2019t cheat anyone. The trade was done sincerely.", "NTA. Professional card buyer and seller here, mostly pokemon actually. Everyone has a bad beats story from trading the wrong card. This kid just got his. You CAN advise the kid and family, could be a cool teachable moment for you and your kid if you want to go down that route, trading and equity and all that. But kid traded the card. Personally, I would get the card framed as the best trade your child will ever make in their life.", "NTA.  The trade was made when the traders had equal knowledge of the value of the cards.  Son discovered after the fact that one of the cards had greater value than either of them knew.  There is no obligation to share that information with anyone.  You found out because of son's innocence.   IMO son should be allowed to keep the cards he trades for.   If the others don't take the same interest in value as he does, he should bear the fruits of his labor.  Trading is a business issue, not a morality issue.   Just my thoughts.  You decide.  I hope you decide in favor of your son.", "NAH. I really don't know what the correct option here is. Your kid traded it fairly, no stealing involved, so I wouldn't say you have to give it back. But I think it really depends on what you personally want to do. If your child just wants to keep it for his collection, then absolutely keep it. If he wants to sell it though, then it might be a bit iffy to not give it back. NAH either way though. Do what you think is right here. Remember just to think about what your teaching your child though.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like this was a fair trade your son did.", "Well, you might be legally obliged to do so. People who say \"a trade is a trade\" forget that kids that age are usually not considered able to make trades in that price class. For example, where I live, a kid could trade a 5 buck card, but not the one you mentioned. They can buy comics, but not I phones. So you really should look into the legal situation here.\nNot to mention the social fallout this could create for your son.", "Man forget about the other parents, get your money!", "NTA, but you have a huge teachable moment here.  If you  arrange to meet with the other child and his parents in front of your child, explain the situation and offer to return the card, your child will watch integrity in action.", "I think ywbta if you didn\u2019t let the other parents know. A lot of parents don\u2019t know these cards can hold a decent amount of value. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019d want to know if your child accidentally traded a card worth a few thousand right?", "NTA It\u2019s his/your card now, do with it what you will", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good to teach your child to be devious, but I think it\u2019s fair to keep the card and teach your son that you shouldn\u2019t trade things that you a) don\u2019t know the value of b) will be missed. If you tell the parents this could get really ugly in unexpected ways. If they show so little interest in their kids hobbies that they let them trade such value cards, then they are also at fault", "NTA Make sure the card is kept safely and not bent or damaged. Lookup online how to do this, as that with DRASTICALLY change the value from very high to like 200$.\n\nYou'll have to send it away to have it graded (appraised for quality and condition) and put into a case. Then auction it off online.\n\nBuy more cards for your kiddo and put some extra $ in his education fund.", "If my info is correct: The prices probably are for mint or near mint cards, means: just touched once and put directly into a folder.\nIf the card looks like it was played (which i would assume because kids) it's not nearly worth as much.\n\n\nNTA - kids don't care about collecting cards this way & they did a trade which seems valuable to both of them.", "NTA but think a minute. If the roles were reversed what would you want to have happen?", "NTA but your son might be one. \n\nDifficult situation, if your son traded some cards knowing that he was ripping off his friends I think that you have to discuss with him the moral problem this situation causes. Basically, if the trade was fair I don't really see the problem but the game should stay just a game and not a business for your child. Obviously, the money from your son's cards should stay with him maybe for his college tuition in the future.", "Haha \"not well off\" with \"kind\" grandparents that can afford a private school comes across as kind of well off. Anyhow, keep it.", "Imagine this kind of stuff happening in the sports world. LA Lakers dropping to the bottom of the NBA, New Orleans Pelicans drafting Victor Wembanyama, and he ends up being even better than expected and the Pelicans come over to the Lakers and say, \"Hey remember that pick? Yeah he was even better than thought, did you know this was going to be the draft this year?\" Of course not. Those trades are final once they're made. There's no going back unless both teams agree to another trade. \n\nPokemon cards are the same way. NTA. Sucks they lost out on that, but you're not obligated to tell them anything. That was a fair trade, your son just unknowingly finessed them.", "Exactly, if the parents had paid the full value of the card originally. then I could see there being an issue, but if the kid just traded cards they got in a packet, no one lost money.", "My husband had a rare shiny charazard card that was out of the pack and traded. It's worth \u00a3250,000 problem, is, he kept it \"safe\"  in a bible, and his mum threw away the bible.", "Exactly. If you're worried about losing an expensive card don't let your nine year old trade them unsupervised.", "To be blunt, a card that has been in a kid\u2019s collection and passed around is not likely to be worth the top dollar. My daughter has a few rare cards. But the value is much less than the highest grade values because the cards have to be absolute mint to have real value.", "Also would the card be his? Or would you keep it and sell it?", "If you read it, OP said their son did research on the card he traded and saw it was worth a lot. So, no the son isn\u2019t an AH.", "True. Even if it\u2019s not worth a few thousand I\u2019m sure anyone would want to know if their kid just gave away even a few hundred for free basically.", "He literally said the kid didn't know it was worth a lot but knew it was a good card with good stats.", "YWBTA as you'd be taking advantage of children not understanding the value of property and from a legal standpoint in some places the other kid's parents (if aware) could file in small claims because of this very reason.\n\nGarage sales are fairer game as the onus is on the adult seller to appraise their goods.\n\nWhile I do get it, and the kids were both happy with their trading, due to having wisdom it'd be the right time to teach both kids about integrity. (And maybe treat your kid to a pack or two or such as a reward)", "NAH. Why is everyone saying NTA? Who in this story is supposed to be an asshole?", "I can't think of a modern era ungraded card worth that much. Definitely check the valuation. If it's a vintage card I'd reconsider your son's side of the story.", "YTA.  Your 9 year old traded another 9 year old something of high value.  Of course you make him give it back.  If he came home with a laptop and said he traded it for a stick of gum, of course you\u2019d call the parents and give it back.  You don\u2019t get to profit off a 9-year-old who doesn\u2019t know any better.  Geez.", "This is so tricky because of the ages. They are 9 year old kids who aren't going to know the value of these cards. We have a no trade policy at the school I work for, for this exact reason. I'd probably notify the parents personally but I wouldn't say you are an asshole if you didn't.", "NTA unless the other kid traded the card away by accident. You should consider if the other family needs the money more than you do, but you don't have to give it back just because you researched the card's worth and they didn't. However, you SHOULD encourage your kid to tell his friends about whatever resource you used to find  out the card's value. YWBTA for preying on his friend's ignorance in future, as I assume they aren't any more knowledgeable about the value of Pokemon cards than your kid was.", "INFO: you are keeping the card for your son right, not for your general finances?", "That\u2019s a cute idea.  He\u2019s probably more upset now that he can\u2019t/shouldn\u2019t actually use it. Thanks for your input!", "Thank you. Yes he had no idea and was purely into the stats. I know he wouldn\u2019t have done it on purpose.", "I don\u2019t know where the boy got his from. We just bought him sealed packs on Amazon. I know nothing about them but when we googled the card to verify, it\u2019s selling in that range online.", "I don't think the 9 year old was intentionally ripping off a friend and he only found out the worth after. He is 9. Not a professional collector.", "You might want want make sure it's not a reprint. Thr first edition of that card might be worth that, but odds are if the other kid just got it out of a pack like your son it's probably not worth what you think. I mean Def don't feel bad keeping the card, but I also wouldn't vet your hopes up that the card might pay off some bills or something. Most of the really expensive cards are older, so the fact that this kid has the card and has been playing with it and its still in good shape means there's a good chance it's a newer reprint.", "I can\u2019t think of any cards that\u2019s worth that much ungraded. You sure it\u2019s not a reprint?", "Same I'm struggling to believe this", "what can assure you that the son is telling the truth, are you telling me that in this situation with that kind of money a child couldn't lie? I'm not saying that he is an a\\*\\*\\* but he got his cards from the internet you may wonder what kind of knowledge he has. A 9-year-old is not stupid so I don't think you can rule this option.", "OP said the kid didn't understand the card was financially valuable and I don't know any 9 year olds that understand monetary value very well or even think much about money. \n\nAs a parent myself, I see no reason to doubt the post.", "I just think that's a possibility, do I think it's the most likely ? Never said that, but with the kid going on the internet AFTER, you might wonder if he told the whole truth about his knowledge. He sought the value of the card afterward, what if he previously knew? He never searched for the value of the cards he had before but after trading some he decided to look it up.  I think that's a possibility, the most likely? probably not, but we just have the parent side of the story.", "NTA, a trade is a trade, I highly suspect it to be a countefit", "INFO: are you going to keep all the money if it is worth something, or will your son get some of it?", "I don't think your 9 year old has a pokemon card that is worth that much. It's most likely fake", "YTA I have an 8 year old who trades cards. If he had one that was legitimately worth this much, I\u2019d ask him to give it back.", "Yes, only perfect cards have value.  It means not a single scratch or white dot.  Is the card sleeved at least ?", "Sell it and split it 50/50 with the other kids parents. Maybe third each, a third to OP's son for being a budding little entrepreneur", "What did she have against the bible? \ud83d\ude02", "[removed]", "Almost no shot it's actually worth that much. The prices you're seeing are likely very high grade examples. What's the card?", "Nothing \ud83d\ude02... he had moved out and didn't use it anymore. He was a seven day adventist for a while but came away from it in his late teens.", "Tbh, I doubt she even knew it was there.", "I guess we should properly get its value before figuring anything out. We only just found out about this so we\u2019ve not taken any action or had time to really. It doesn\u2019t sit right with me if it is valuable though and I would honestly feel terrible keeping it!\n\nSince I don\u2019t know this child or where he got it from, I couldn\u2019t say if it is a reprint etc. or have any clue on it\u2019s condition. Figuring that out is probably the first port of call in this situation.", "Yes I agree. Plus to you the card might look really good but when you have it graded will probably be an 8 or less. Those 3500 Crds are probably graded 9.6 or 9.8. A card worth that much that only has a grade of 8 could easily go from 3500 to 150 bucks. The only way to know for sure would be to have it graded but that also costs money so you could wind up barely breaking even on the card if it isn't super pristine.", "Looking around there's a subreddit /r/Pokemoncardappraisal which has a couple of useful stickies to read and you could post there if you desired to. If it's like an original base set card, you can likely search up the card and find someone comparing it to the original to work out what it is. Though I'd probably bootleg-check the card first - compare it to a known, good pokemon card and see if the print looks off. \n\nIf there is damage that is visible to you, then it's likely to be low grade - grading is a very fussy process, looking closely at the card for any dings and scrapes on the edges etc that a casual person would likely never notice. [Most of what goes into grading](https://www.psacollector.com/how-to-grade-pokemon-cards). If it wasn't stuffed into a sleeve soon as it was out of the pack it likely has some form of damage. Some cards can come out of the packs damaged...", "Fair point, but even then there's no social obligation to educate your trading partner that they're making a bad trade.", "If the kid knew it's an unfair trade, it's not about educating your trading partner but rather not hiding an unfair advantage. That's why Insider trading is illegal, the goal is that everyone is on equal footing.", "Legally the kid would have been fine as that info was publicly available for the other kid to research too.", "Of course YTA, the child who traded it likely had no idea of the value when he gave it away. \u201cA trade is a trade\u201d applies to ADULTS who are making educated decisions. So be the adult here, contact the child\u2019s parents and go from there.", "NTA. Like Beanie Babies and Avon only worth that to the person willing to pay it. Wish you luck finding that person.", "NTA you should have a clear conscience. If the kids' parent actively tries to get the card back, be a good sport and return it. If not, be thankful for a quick come up.", "Honestly, it's probably not worth 3500 quid. Before you worry about what to do with it, you should probably figure out the facts. Pretty much all kids get hyped up by youtubers and don't understand ebay and think their collection is worth thousands at some point. I'm a teacher and I hear it multiple times a day. They're pretty much always all wrong lol.", "You\u2019re doing him a favor as long as you let it grow in value and give it to him when he is an adult.", "I have a neighbor who made over 100k on his Pok\u00e9mon cards but he tells me that it\u2019s become increasingly difficult to make money on Pok\u00e9mon cards after Logan Paul.", "Professional card buyer...but you think the kid really traded for  3500 quid card??", "how can I be a professional PKMN card seller?", "Yea\u2026 surprised at all the nta comments here. Guessing the card isn\u2019t really that expensive though", "It blows my mind that somoene would pay 250k for the Pokemon card.", "Probably not, but, I've dream crushed enough kids I didn't feel like ruining the mood.", "U/ailyssa simple you just buy and sell enough pokemon cards at enough profit that it pays your bills.", "It's like trading stocks but the market is less influenced by terrorism.", "Agree. Especially the newer cards, my kid pulled a rainbow shiny whatever from a pack (so it would be near mint condition as it went straight into a sleeve), and that's worth like 25 quid. Newer cards are printed in such volume that they're not usually valued in the hundreds of dollars range.", "u/Sepasdfgh is possibly a bot. Remarks taken from u/SnooComics9052.", "I figured it was okay to dream crush the adult but...oof, that got me right in the feels. Know the feeling.", "even in Europe? My hat off to you sir.
