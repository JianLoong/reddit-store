She probably had met your mother, since your mother died 5 years ago, and your daughter is 19. Your gf probably has no connection with your mom, so why does she need the ring? By saying that the daughter won't inherit the ring someday, and that your gf will probably give it to her own child, it hurt your daughter, and you don't even seem to care. Whether your mom was terrible or not, the ring represents something to your daughter, and you just gave it away, making her feel like you do not care about her at all.
