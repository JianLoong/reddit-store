By saying that the daughter won't inherit the ring someday, and that your gf will probably give it to her own child, it hurt your daughter, and you don't even seem to care. Whether your mom was terrible or not, the ring represents something to your daughter, and you just gave it away, making her feel like you do not care about her at all.
