Shit I could I could want to do something tomorrow and then tomorrow could roll around and that doesn't sound like such a fun idea anymore. Did OP even try to compromise on anything? Like how about \"Sure I'll join you guys for a bit, but how about a movie after dinner instead of movies all night?\" It seems like there is zero communication here at all.", "My concern is that this is normal attention seeking behavior from him since he states it so matter of factly. People that use this type of behavior generally use it normally or don't at all. There are probably deeper issues here than OP realizes. \n\n>Are we taking his side?\n\nThat depends. Nobody is perfect. If it's not a frequent thing then there's no reason why it can't be dealt with in a more constructive way. And ignores all attempts at interaction? What interaction? When he complained she didn't want to bingewatch movies anymore? When he pouted and said he didn't want to play? When he nagged at her about cutlery? When he nagged at her about misplaced spices? When he nagged at her about not throwing away trash properly? When he nagged about her not putting her clothes away? When he questioned her about the check oil light on the car? He did not give one example of positive interaction the entire time after she got home. He was quite obviously just pestering her. Who wants to be pestered after a shitty day at work? I not saying she's in the right but I'm also not saying OP is in the right either. There is an obvious communication issue here.", "So you know for a fact what OP\u2019s intentions are or is that how you would act? \u201cWhy ask someone about laundry on the floor\u201d maybe he\u2019s doing laundry and wants to get all of it so they don\u2019t have to do multiple loads, maybe she has some clothing that can\u2019t be washed a particular way and he didn\u2019t want to ruin it. You\u2019re assuming that he\u2019s being childish and demanding attention he\u2019s simply existing in his own home and involving his partner in the decision she should take some part in.", "Regardless date or movie plans, whatever you may call it. she had no intention to even ask OP if he wanted to do something together before ditching. He obviously wanted to spend time with her and she repaid him with utter disrespect. While he was making dinner for her, for that matter.", "I'd say yes. She's flipping the situation on it's head to paint herself as the victim with the intention of encouraging OP to think he was the one at fault. Sounds pretty gaslight-y to me, bud.", "Using this incredibly broad interpretation of \"questioning perception of reality\" you could classify almost any disagreement as gaslighting. What she's doing is manipulative but not gaslighting.", "Or she\u2019s just emotionally immature and honestly believes everything she\u2019s saying. We\u2019re really stretching the meaning of gaslighting here. We can agree she\u2019s in the wrong without blowing it out of proportion.", "Well the Sanity isn\u2019t actually a requirement for it to be gaslighting, that\u2019s why there\u2019s a cheeky \u2018or\u2019 in the middle of the dictionary definition on the other side of the \u2018or\u2019 is the phrase \u2018perception of reality\u2019 surely by dismissing his worries without addressing them and instead suggesting his discomfort is actually him being jealous, manipulative and implying abusive behaviours (alienating your partner from friends is emotional abuse) would be covered by \u201ccausing a person to question their own perception of reality\u201d", "Oh good lord, you cant be serious right now. You want to redefine the word to \"oh yeah? well i'm going to use the word however the fuck i want and if you tell me i'm wrong YOU'RE GASLIGHTING ME\"\n\nThis whole subreddit is bonkers...", "Their intentions are relevant. They objectively are the most important part of gaslighting. That\u2019s literally the whole point of gaslighting. That\u2019s what makes gaslighting so insidious! \n\nIf it\u2019s not intentional it\u2019s not gaslighting.", "No. That\u2019s a disagreement. Gaslighting is a long term attempt to undermine someone\u2019s sense of reality. Even if we think she\u2019s being ridiculous, she may genuinely believe everything she\u2019s accusing him of. We have no way of knowing. \n\nGaslighting is not the same thing. People can just be stubborn sometimes and say dumb things because they\u2019re emotional.\n\nWhat you\u2019re describing is the pop culture version of it that has evolved over the past few years. It\u2019s not what the term actually means. People have misunderstood what the term means and have misused it.", "Again, not gaslighting. Gaslighting is a very long term, intentionally malicious strategy to force the other person to question their own sanity and become totally reliant on the gaslighter. \n\nThis is just someone avoiding responsibility for their actions.", "Aren't you a woman?", "Yeah ok. My gf sometimes comes home after a stressful day of work and says \"I don't feel like watching our show right now, I'm going to play some overwatch\" and I say \"Sure no problem I'll find something else to do for now, good luck\". I do the same some days. That's just how shit goes sometimes.", "Agreed.  \n\nWhatever's going on, the girlfriend not leaping away from her game because OP couldn't find the salt or whatever.  \n\nIt's rude to keep the food waiting, but IMO every single hobby has that issue: let me just finish my chapter, let me just knit to the end of my row, just one more minigame, I just blended the perfect watercolour shade, I'm just going to use it...", "We don\u2019t know what she\u2019s thinking. We\u2019re not mind readers. We can agree she\u2019s being ridiculous, but we don\u2019t know what\u2019s actually going on or what she\u2019s thinking. Let\u2019s not forget we\u2019re getting OP\u2019s version of what happened. I agree, based on OP\u2019s account, that she\u2019s in the wrong, but let\u2019s take it with a grain of salt and not assume.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s broad personally I think it\u2019s quite literal?", "No, I just want folks like you who get a high off correcting people online to stop behavior that keeps abuse victims from reporting", "I guess we just fundamentally disagree. I care about the victim's experience, and that defines the situation for me. I get where you are coming from, but we are talking about OP's experience here and how he should react. If the person has so little self awareness that their manipulation is unintentional, that still fits the bill imo because it doesn't change what OP experienced.", "Ok, but in this instance she blew off established plans with her husband to partake in this hobby with her work buddy. That could've waited until after dinner. The food getting cold means she was on there for a while.", "I care too. Nothing I said suggests I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if you just mis worded that, but I was a victim of abuse too. I care too. this isn\u2019t about whether we care or not."]}
