This part that got me was the way he said he kept trying to get her attention. \n\n>I try to get her attention throughout the session while making dinner/cleaning. (These attempts to get her attention were related to utensil, spice misplacement, trash/laundry being left by her upon arriving)\n\nIt just sounds like every time he wanted her attention he nagged at her about something. Sounds like a way to get her to want to spend time with him even less. Who wants to spend time with someone who just tells you everything you have done wrong.", "Thank you, my lord this forum has lost it's collective mind. No wonder the divorce rate is so high they're all ready to burn the house down over missing trash day. FFS.\n\nOP- You're insecure. You overreacted. You *were* being annoying, on purpose. Talk to your wife. It's good that you communicated how you were feeling. Really! I mean that. But you have to figure out *why* you felt that way. \n\nShe might not know you were so invested in this \"date\" and thought- reasonably - that it was just two people *who live together* hanging out and watching movies. It's not your wedding it's movie night. \n\nAlso anyone can get excited and \"giddy\" about a new friend and shared excitement for a game they both play. You read sinister motives into it.  She invited you to join! Why didn't you? Because you were already suspicious and irritated about the other guy, because the friend is male. Why? Has your wife ever given you cause to suspect she is unfaithful? If the answer is no- cut it out! That kind of insecure jealousy is toxic and repellent. \n\nIf you are this hyperalert of her spending any time with male coworkers or friends that's a problem. That poisons marriages. Get back on the same page and work it out. This is not the end of the world unless you both make it that.\n\nYTA here.", "They planned to bingewatch movies. Sometimes it sounds like a good idea, and then when the time comes you don't feel like it. My gf and I \"plan\" to do things all the time, and sometimes one of us just isn't in the mood for that thing when it comes up. Sounds like OP got butthurt about the cancelation (somewhat reasonable) but instead of just dealing with it, he passively aggressively nagged at her about stuff around the house for however long just to take her attention away from what she was doing because he was jealous. It sounds like even without coworker in the picture communication is an issue in this relationship if he thinks that is a normal healthy way to gain someone's attention.", ">I try to get her attention throughout the session while making dinner/cleaning. (These attempts to get her attention were related to utensil, spice misplacement, trash/laundry being left by her upon arriving)\n\nYeah sounds like there is a big communication issue if this is normal behavior in that relationship.", "What", "Nope. \u201cThe relationship is over\u201d with zero true context is absolute bullshit.", "Exactly, if you don't trust your partner, you have much bigger problems in your relationship", "\"Gaslighting is a form of psychological abuse in which a person or group causes someone to question their own sanity, memories, or perception of reality.\"  \n\"Gaslighting is the subjective experience in which an individual's perception of reality is repeatedly undermined or questioned by another person.\"  \n\n\nI mean.. .even with the dictionary definition of gaslighting, what she is doing is NOT gaslighting. Even if she WAS having an affair what she's doing right now is lying, not gaslighting.", "Still not gaslighting.\n\nOP: but we were made plans to watch movies today\n\nWife: no we didn't \n\nOP: but we had a conversation about it on Tuesday\n\nWife: no we didn't, I wasn't even at home Tuesday\n\nTHAT would be gaslighting", "No, this is just someone making accusations. Accusations which, mind you, we don\u2019t know are true or not.\n\nEven if untrue this isn\u2019t in the same stratosphere as gaslighting.", "Nobody plays \"just one time\" like that lmao.", "Yeah I don't want to make any assumptions to either side, but normally this type of behavior is not one-off behavior. The way OP presents it matter-of-factly as a way to gain attention suggests to me that he finds it to be normal behavior. We can't say for certain whether or not something is going on with the co-worker, but it does seem like there are underlying issues pushing OPs wife away from him.", "She's bored of sitting at home so she plays the video game?\n\nYou're reaching pretty damn hard here.", "Are you familiar with the term geriatric pregnancy? (Hint: pregnancy at over 35 is considered geriatric/high risk)\n\nI\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m downvoted, but the simple fact is that your mid to late 20s is the best time biologically/already established life. Peak fertility purely biologically starts in the late teens, with a steep decline past 30. \n\nAnyone who doesn\u2019t like that is shooting the messenger, I would suggest you shout your complaints to the sky/science/god/Gaia/whatever your personal belief system, because I certainly did not have a hand in programming human fertility", "\nNTA. This feels a lot like emotional abuse, to be honest.", "Ohhh thank you. I have been super sleep deprived for like 4 days so even the one brain cell I had took a vacation", "Who's sharing? Not him.", "I too, share his wife", "Thank you! That actually is exactly why I wasn\u2019t able to process it. I thought the comment was calling OP feminine for doing chores but I was a 100% sure I was misunderstanding lol", "Ahh gotcha. So it\u2019s ok to tell people to delete posts but you won\u2019t when you\u2019re told to.", "Yup, when I have board game night at my place with my friends he just goes to the bar (bunch of loud girls i get it) i trust him. People need to be less on things, imo maybe I am just old. He just leave me to my night with my friends and i leave him to his. Talk people! It is a two way street.\n\nEdit I dont word good.", "But surely the \u201cyou just being jealous and trying to leave me without friends just like what happened with my parents\u201d making him question if he\u2019s being crazy and manipulative and implying he\u2019s controlling falls into definition?", "that's what is happening\n she told OP he's only reacting the way he is because of irrational jealousy. its its all in his head", "I do see where you're coming from, but \"sanity\" applies in there.\n\nSaying he's being annoying, jealous, and just like her parents by not wanting her to have any friends. That would make him start to question his sanity on this topic, so gaslighting, while loose here, does fit.", "This still isn\u2019t gaslighting though, it\u2019s just lying. Gaslighting is a very long term strategy done maliciously and specifically to force the other person to doubt their own judgment and trust the gaslighter completely and without question. \n\nYour example is someone lying, but certainly could ultimately lead to gaslighting in the long term.", "Or \n\nOP: You were being pretty mean to me, ignoring my questions and getting pissy with me, why?\n\nWife: I wasn\u2019t doing any of that, you\u2019re just being jealous and don\u2019t want me to have friends\n\nIs that not gaslighting?", "No, she acted like an ass and when he told her about it she just shifted and said he was the one with the problem.

See the rest of my comments I an on no ones side. Just giving my personal opinion.", "They are saying that being annoyed by the questions isn't the point. The point is she canceled the plans on him to talk and hangout with someone else. If I had a plan with my SO and they did this I would be hurt as well. These guys are probably just young because this all sounds like really immature responses from everyone when OP should have just said \"Hey can we talk? it hurts my feelings you canceled on me to instead hangout online with some other guy. It's hard not to feel jealous when it feel like you are more interested in this new guy than me.\""]}
