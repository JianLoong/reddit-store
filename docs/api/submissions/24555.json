She starts smiling ear to ear when talking to him, getting giddy, and over exaggerating simple tips from him. \n\nI try to get her attention throughout the session while making dinner/cleaning. \n(These attempts to get her attention were related to utensil, spice misplacement, trash/laundry being left by her upon arriving)\nBut she ignores me, momentarily mutes him then cuts me off and then accused me of being annoying. \n\nI get frustrated.\n\nI finish dinner and cleaning.\nI tell her a couple of times that dinner is ready and served, she ignores it a couple of times. \nAfter about 10 minutes I ask her how much longer she's gonna play since food is getting cold.\n\nShe pouts, ends game.\n\nAfter their session ends, she gets mad at me and calls me annoying/jealous. \n\nI told her I felt that way because she cancelled our movie plans last second to play with a coworker she's been with all day, she ignored me when I tried getting her attention, cut me off to continue talking to him and displayed behaviors that made me slightly uncomfortable. \n\nNow she's mad and claims her parents did the same things and now I won't let her have friends.

Time to set clear and firm boundaries.", "NTA.  Gaslighting, emotional affair, refuses to talk about it, won\u2019t acknowledge your feelings.

But you allowed it which I guess is cool however instead of joining in on the game you decided to be clingy and codependent instead of enjoying the game which is an asshole move on your part. \n\nI don\u2019t think anything untoward is going on but in YOUR relationship you get to make boundaries on what YOU want in your relationship. \n\nNot being ok with your wife prioritizing game time with her Co-workers over YOUR alone time is an acceptable boundary to make.", "She for the streets", "NTA\n\nRefusing to discuss, blame-shifting, assigning motive (calling you jealous), false accusation (not letting her \u201chave\u201d friends), the silent treatment\u2026\n\nIf this is her pattern, she\u2019s emotionally abusive.", "If she hasn\u2019t cheated yet she 100% will with this guy.", "NTA.

If it was an affair like everyone is suggesting, there would be some level of duplicity and there isn\u2019t. \n\nSomething else is going on in your marriage probably that you don\u2019t notice and she does (like maybe they\u2019re in a rut, idk.) The whole thing is dumb. I think people saying she is emotionally abusive are really going too hard. I also think your wife\u2019s accusations toward you are extreme based solely off what you told us.\n\nYou guys suck at communicating and you\u2019re not feeling connected.

Most of these comments are batshit insane.\n\nShe just wanted to play a game instead of watching movies. Thats all. She asked if OP wanted to join for fucks sake.

She invited you to play with them, you refused. Would you blow her phone if instead of playing games at home she was out at a bar with a friend ? \n\nTo be perfectly clear : I totally get your frustration and I really think your wife owns you a apologise because she canceled last minute your movie night. But you behaved very poorly, like a teenager. You have to apologise for your behavior. After you apologised, I think as a couple you have a lot to unpack then : does she really feel lonely ? Does she have a crush on this coworker ? Is she bored in your relationship ? Do you usually feel neglected ? You can't build a relationship without an open communication and a reel honesty, both of you, especially if she feels something for him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My long term boyfriend and I started couple\u2019s counseling to learn how to communicate better because we started butting heads over dumb shit like this. And it turned out we had some underlying issues. He felt like I was accusatory and I felt like he didn\u2019t notice me, blah blah. We still have our issues but we communicate much better\n\nA relationship is work. Counseling isn\u2019t just for when things go wrong-you can go to learn how to solve issues before they start.

Because it sounds like you have suspicions, but only she can confirm them one way or the other.\n\nIf you're on a very tight budget for the last year, maybe it needs to be relaxed a little to allow for more fun as well.", "You sound like you are doing all you can to be supportive to her, which is great. However, she is a grown ass woman who is part of a team (you and her, I mean - that's what a relationship is) Was this \"anxiety & depression\" still there when she played with her new friend? Doesn't sound like it. Also, have you told her that her behaviour makes you feel neglected? Do you guys communicate well?", "Not really, the most I asked was \"How much longer are you gonna play\" \nThis was after I told her a few times dinner was ready and served, she ignored that as well.", "Well the food things I understand but the other stuff, meh I would be annoyed as well, is a new game you wouldnt play with her? Did she ask you to play first then to be clear asked you again to play with them and you didnt want to?"]}
