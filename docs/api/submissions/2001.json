Does she complain? Does she interact with your family while you're at said dinner/event?", "Hahaha buddy you're in a marriage. Yes you married your wife but your wife comes with her family. Maybe instead of being self serving try to think about it from her perspective. She doesn't want to spend multiple dinners a week trying to not feel awkward and explaining to her family why you just want to be a lump on the couch when they're there.\n\nYou're part of her life now.

I provide the same for him. I'd never force him into something he didn't want to do. I can't believe everyone piling on you. Sometimes less is more.
