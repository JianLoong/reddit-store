Grow up, YTA.", "If you're having trouble learning then a great way to fix that is to practice with native speakers. And yet you're trying to spend *less* time with them?\n\nHow old are you? Being in awkward and uncomfortable situations is a part of life. Sometimes that's just what adults do for the sake of those who are important to us. \n\nOne would hope your wife is important to you, and clearly her family is important to her.\n\nExpecting to avoid them because it's awkward is unreasonable if they haven't otherwise done anything wrong. And the more time you spend with them, the less awkward it will be.\n\nMake an effort.", "It\u2019s so pathetic when people act like assholes to the important people in their lives and then reframe it to make it sound like they are doing those people a favor.", "You clearly won't change your mind. Why did you make this post? Did you hope people would agree with you and you could show her?\n\nAnyway, please remember this post when your wife leaves you. A lot of people have explained to you why it's wrong not to put some effort into something that's important for your wife. You have no right to act suprised when she gets fed up and leaves.", "Said the man who just had his last BJ from his wife ever", "You really don\u2019t think your wife does things for you that she\u2019d rather not just for the sake of your relationship? If you feel like chicken and she feels like fish no one concedes and you make two separate meals? If she doesn\u2019t love doing the dishes they don\u2019t get done? If you want to see a comedy and she wants to see a romance y\u2019all watch separate movies? \n\nYou two just operate on completely separate paths of life with no one ever giving in to make the other happy?  Odd.", "This is a question about perspective and reciprocity in your relationship with your wife. This is a want that she expressed to you and you are free to say no but you should try to understand where she is coming from and how she views your actions because you said no. Her feelings are involved and you seem not to care. That\u2019s where you probably will have a problem going forward.", "It's worse than ignoring them, it's making a deliberate statement that you do not want to spend your time with them.\n\nIt's **rude.**\n\nYTA", "When you married, did you invite your in-laws to celebrate?\n\nWhen your FIL and MIL pass (knock on wood) away, will you expect your children and/or to inherit wife from them, if there is anything to be passed on? Do you expect to indirectly benefit from this inheritance?\n\nThis is what getting married means, you may not be related by blood to your in-laws, but legally you are bound together.", "I hope so. Wife deserves a lot more.", "No.  IT is not.  Your wife is only worth the bare minimum effort to you?  She is not worth more than human decency to you?  \n\n\nThat seems like an unfulfilling and miserable marriage to know that your partner views those you love as a burden and only worth human decency.  A marriage like that breeds bitterness and resentment.", "That\u2019s why I think it would be better for me to not go.\n\nLike if you only see them couple times a year wouldn\u2019t it be better to have some \u201cprivate \u201c time with your family?", "I feel as though you\u2019re just making excuses at this point to try and get more people to validate your choice so you don\u2019t feel like TA.", "What kind of private time do you think they need?  If they needed to have a sensitive conversation, it would probably be done at home, with you in another room (or in the same room, since you haven't learned their language anyway).  It's her visiting parents!  They don't need privacy, she wants you involved with her family because you're her family too.", "I see your side, but if you love her, that means you do things to make her happy (as long as they\u2019re legal and won\u2019t hurt anyone). If she really wants you there, just suck it up and go. You may think you\u2019re giving them more time together but they may think you don\u2019t want them around if you\u2019re not welcoming. I presume you\u2019re better company than you\u2019re presenting here if she really wants you there."]}
