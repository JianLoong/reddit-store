This might be her game but you sure as shit better be on the field ready for a pass. Stop behaving like a damn child. Now  give some real feedback instead of the same repetitive garbage.

In fact, husband added onto our house a $35K mother-in-law suite so my Mom (who at the time was in her early 50s) could live with us. She was like a third parent to our little girls. As she aged and they entered their teen years, they helped her take care of herself and her household tasks. When she had to move to retirement community, our daughters took turns helping their Memaw. My husband is my knight in shining armor and always has been.

You and your wife love each other and by extension your respective communities. You don't live in a vacuum. \n\nThis is especially helpful to remember when getting married into a different culture. You are going to bring your own habits, language, way of life into the marriage, just as your wife will. You learn her language, her customs, you befriend and spend time with her family and friends even when you don't want to because it makes her happy to share that part of her life with you. Just as she would do the same for you. \n\nI don't know how old you are but you sound very young and very new with this whole marriage thing so I want to remember to be gentle with my criticisms.\n\nThe attitude you are displaying with this issue comes across very selfish and inconsiderate of your wife's feelings or her family who are travelling to visit.  Even though you don't mean it this way but it comes across that you don't want to spend time with her family, you don't want to get to know her family, and worst case you dislike her family for whatever reason. \n\nThis attitude will cause problems in your marriage so you should try to reframe how you see these dinners, outtings, whatver with her family into a more positive light, like an opportunity to practice learning her language, to get to know her family better, etc.\n\nAsk her to help you with translating more, or finding topics of common interests, etc.\n\nI married someone from a completely different culture and his family doesn't speak English or my language. I constantly ask him to translate, and help me when we visit. We try to have dinners or meals together because we are a family, all together. Yes, it is hard sometimes and sometimes I do feel left out when I don't understand but it's not hard to sit through it. I will sometimes just listen to train my ears to his language. Sometimes I zone out.

My father in law lived in a different state and would come to our state once or twice a year for a week or two, split between my husband and his brother. He was a difficult man - bigoted, tactless and often demanding - and my husband was usually working more than me. However, I could suck it up for the time he was here for my husband's sake. He knew he was difficult and called him out at times but was also happy to let me vent to him when I needed to. He was definitely a product of his generation but also loved his son. He passed away a couple of years ago and I'm glad that I could bite my tongue for a few days a year so that my husband got that time with him before we lost him. Going out for dinner with house guests seems like the bare minimum of politeness. Even if he doesn't like them it's about being civil.", "INFO: How long have you been an adult?", "I stopped covering for my husband. I'm not doing the mental gymnastics anymore to come up for an excuse for him. When he decides to bail on family events and people ask me, I just tell them the truth. These are his choices; it's not fair to make me the one to deal with them.", "My husband is somewhat like that. He\u2019s not keen on going to restaurants. Added to that, he has health issues, and is picky as hell. ( His mom wasn\u2019t a very good cook, so he ate a lot of junk food.) I\u2019m a pretty good cook, and I manage to make things within the perimeter of what is healthy and that he likes. (Don\u2019t mind admitting that I get tired of cooking sometimes. On some of those days, he\u2019ll go buy himself a sub sandwich)", "What kind of dates do you go on ?", "On these dates how often are they...\nA: Things she's interested in but you're not, yet you do it to support her interests. \nB: Things you're both interested in.\nC: Things you're interested in but she's not yet still there because you are.", "So much this! There are certainly genuine causes of awkwardness or phobias around social situations, and I don't want to down play them, but I feel like a lot of people wave the introvert flag as a smoke screen for selfish asshole behaviors.\n\nI'm an introvert and people are shocked when I tell them. I used to do event coordination for trade shows and no one would have ever guessed I was. What they never saw was me collapsing and being utterly useless once I got home from the psychological drain of dealing with that many people for multiple days in a row. \n\nAs my wife learned, while we were still dating, this was just how I operated. On my recovery day, she'd order take out from one of my favorite places (I do all the cooking normally) and not even bother asking me what I wanted (my decision fatigue would be at 110%) but just picked a meal she knew I enjoy. Honestly it was one of the biggest green flags for me knowing she was an incredible partner since she understood and supported me in such simple but meaningful a way.\n\nWe've been together for 15 years now and I happily do my damnedest to reciprocate that level of support every day. If she tells me something is important, unless I have truly immovable obligations, I'll be there for her regardless of my personal opinions or feelings about it. She does the same for me.", "I hear you! My highly introverted husband runs a sales organization! Every single person who knows him professionally thinks he is the most genuine, open, engaged person.
