I love it. Simple, yet lethal to the ears. \n\nstress should never be an excuse for getting away with comments which are sensitive. Your sister should have apologised at least once she calmed down from Thanksgiving.", "NTA.  Just because someone is stressed does not give them a free pass on apologizing for bad behavior.  However, beware loud or messy (glitter) payback when you do have kids.", "NTA. What grudge? She never even apologised! It's still an open wound she hasn't done shit to heal - which by the by certainly argues against the \"well she's stressed\" defense - which by the by the by is a shit defense. If she's stressed, she can work on keeping her damn mouth shut. It's not on you to take her cruelty every time she' s stressed which, let's see here, you said it happened at Thanksgiving and she still hasn't apologised so apparently she can be counted on to be cruel for months on end. But you can't be hurt. Yeah, okay. I hope the toys have non-removeable batteries. Also high five to you for a comeback worth the wait!", "You shouldn\u2019t have told her why you bought all of the noisy gifts.

However based on the OP I'm going with NTA.\nYou asked her to stop. \nShe didn't.\n\nIt sounds like you have been trying for awhile and for whatever reason it hasn't work yet. It doesn't sound like it's a secret to the family, so even if she is stressed with four kids I could have let the first comment slide but not to keep going after you asked her to stop.\n\nTbh... I probably would have done the same thing you did but take it a step further... make sure it was all toys that were liund and obnoxious that she couldn't take the batteries out of (drums anyone??)", "It takes a pretty awful person to say the thing that they KNOW is going to hurt you the **most.**\n\nThen to have the *audacity* to blame it on stress. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, that was a very mean spirited thing for her to say.

She made fun of me for being older than her but not having kids yet (she has 4, I\u2019m still trying for my first). When I asked her not to talk about that because it\u2019s a sore spot for me she continued making fun of me for it, and I ended up crying, which she claimed was me fake crying for sympathy and to turn people against her. Everyone else excused her actions by saying she was stressed and she never would have done it otherwise, which I guess is true because she doesn\u2019t usually acknowledge me at family gatherings. \n\nShe didn\u2019t apologize and I was still mad by Christmas so every single Christmas gift I got for her kids were the most annoying noise-making toys I could find, as a sort of light-hearted payback. I told her that at least without kids I can\u2019t get driven mad by noisy toys like her, and she got upset saying she couldn\u2019t believe I held a grudge for so long and for something she did while stressed out and not thinking. She says I\u2019m punishing her for my own jealousy over her having kids, but honestly I just wanted a tiny bit of payback for her rude comments. My family thinks it was a weird thing for me to do and I should have forgiven her ages ago in the spirit of Thanksgiving and Christmas.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
