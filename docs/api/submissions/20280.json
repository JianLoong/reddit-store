Is your sister a drug addict? Im asking this seriously. If it was just the attempted theft (of other small things) and not asking for funds constantly on top of that, I may believe she did it for the rush/high of doing it. Her behavior however is an extremely high indicator of addiction, and I say this as a recovered addict. Normal people even in the most dire of circumstances (i.e losing their home, car, etc) don\u2019t do these things. \n\nThey\u2019re not willing to risk losing their kids, going to prison, ruining their reputation, and most importantly losing their familial relationships for that. They lose more than they\u2019d gain. The only people willing to make such a risk, are addicts. Say it were serious financial issue: like she was going into foreclosure. She would be taking out loans, getting a second job, or asking for money -specific to the bill in question. If that were the case.. you absolutely would have known about something like that by now. **Now say I\u2019m wrong, and it\u2019s not addiction. You have a way bigger problem on you hands if that\u2019s the case.

By doing so saving them the headache of having to deal with her themselves. They\u2019d rather further victimize the victim, than have to deal with the perpetrator in any way.** Don\u2019t fall for it, it\u2019s not your responsibility. Tell them if they feel she did nothing wrong: then you\u2019ll be happy to pass the message along to your sister that they\u2019re happy to let her ransack their home in place of yours.

She\u2019s not going to like either one.** Whatever\u2019s going on with your sister will come to light, but you cannot be in that crossfire. If it\u2019s addiction you trying to help her won\u2019t do a thing, if it\u2019s a mental health issue that\u2019s fixated on you/you\u2019re money you\u2019re only putting yourself in danger.", "NTA, but I'm also unsure why you made this post.

She probably told Mom she took three bags intending to give one to Mom.", "NTA family or not that is robbery, good job for catching her in the act, I\u2019d ban your sister from your house and file a police report if anything else comes up\n\nI hope you didn\u2019t give her any money when she texted you for it, if you do, stop", "NTA\n\nHas your collection been appraised and insured?\n\nA lock on the handbag collection might be a good idea.", "Wait wait why would your aunt be her mom and you guys are sisters? wait what? wait huh??? WHAT? also NTA", "NTA.  SHE WAS STEALING FROM YOU!!!!", "NTA. She was attempting to steal and that is simply wrong. How anyone could take her side in this blows my mind.\n\nYou obviously know her well enough to suspect her activities and she justified your suspicions.\n\nIf you don't want more conflict like this in the future, please cut contact with her.", "NTA, do your parents know how much those handbags are worth??? Sis tried stealing a massive amount of money from you. She knew what she was doing by targeting those specific bags. And the fact that she feels entitled to your wealth is disgusting. I\u2019d never allow her over agin.", "NTA. As much as I want to ask questions and get some additional context regarding the nature of your relationship with your sister, and why in God's name your parent's would support her taking your things, It's still clear cut theft and inexcusable. What does your husband think of the situation and how your parents took her side in such a clear cut violation of your trust?", "NTA", "NTA\n\nNext time say: we don\u2019t allow thieves at home. Next time we will call the police.", "Exactly!! I was so scared of it going missing it is the first one I got it was so so so expensive so I was very defensive about it, even my Chanel and my Christian Dior was a great 4k", "And you know NOTHING, Jon Snow.", "Mistake thank you for pointing it out I wasn\u2019t thinking lol I was thinking about my cousin.", "Mistake!! So sorry", "She won over my parents a very long time ago actually, she was better gradewise, and she was good with sports too and that really directed more attention towards her. She rubbed it in a lot, and she used to help them out while I was in college because she had an amazing job, but got laid off during COVID and fell into like deep state of depression, which also made my parents focus on her more so it has always been like this and they use her depression to get her out of these situations.", "Shouod have pushed her into the pool and deleted the ladder.", "NTA. Your sister is a low life trashy and classless bum who needs to find another job or a better job to buy her own designer bags. I\u2019m disgusted because she came PREPARED with her duffel bag to rob you. One thing is to rob a store vs. the person who feeds you. She is a very vile human being. Go NC. She will do it again, next time you won\u2019t be home to witness it. Even with your CC cameras she will deny it and you won\u2019t get your stuff back. A broke bum like your sister has no business stealing and wearing designer bags.", "Especially when she\u2019s been charged with stealing before (and brings a big ass duffel bag to dinner and takes it upstairs?)", "OP it\u2019s time to have a talk with those family members and let them know you will not be raising your children to think stealing is ok. If they continue to support your sister stealing from you then you will not allow your children to be in their presence and you will not be finically supporting families who don\u2019t support your decision", "I don't know if it's been suggested already, but there may even be trackers OP can have put into the bags too", "Artificial scarcity. Its nuts for whats essentially a pocket on a string.", "reading is fundamental", "It is her own home!  No way this is her fault.", "Back when I was taking riding seriously, I did a trial of one of their hunter/jumper saddles.  It was gorgeous but my horse has high withers and it just didn\u2019t feel right. His favorite saddle is a random one I bought off Craigslist as a backup. My horse has been keeping me humble for many years. \n\nThey had a falconry set in the Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog years ago but my husband just laughed at me when I showed it to him. I don\u2019t remember if it included the actual falcon which is kind of the important part.", "And her own sister.  I don\u2019t lock the doors from my sisters.", "Girl what?\n\u201cAITA for not letting my sister literally rob me?\u201d\n\nNo, of course NTA. A Birkin? Depending on which bags you have that could be upwards of 6 figures she was stealing from you. Drop her and anyone who took her side from your life. You can\u2019t trust them and they clearly don\u2019t respect you.", "Your sister is lucky you didnt call the cops on her for trying to STEAL your very expensive bags. Valued over $15K possibly. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nLook, I don't personally **get** the bag interest, but I get the idea of sentimentality and attachment. You bought those bags, you collected them, and you liked them. More to the point, those bags are **yours.** No one has a right to just take them on the basis that you don't have a need or won't miss them, that's on you to decide not some grubby thief playing the victim. I mean, personally, I have some big ticket items in my own home that I'd be **mighty pissed** if someone tried to just take them.\n\nFrankly I'd remember this day that your parents actually took the side of a thief and keep it in mind going forward that this is the quality of grandparent they'll be.", "NTA. Go no contact with your sister because she  is no good.", "NTA There's no way for your sister to steal from you, and you be the asshole unless it was food.", "NTA.  Thieves deserve nothing and should get nothing.", "Big time NTA! She was trying to steal from you and that is basic human conduct and should not be allowed nor minimized. This just shows her envy spirit and like what the papayas?!\n\nMe myself (29F) have a sister (25F) and even when sharing same size and similar taste we do not share anything! If I like something my sister got I asked where she got it and if it is OK with her for me to get the same one. We know that some of our clothes are the same so we let the other know when we are wearing something specific not to twin. \n\nYet thats a total different story: OP sister is in your house and should respect your space, your money and **not steal**! You were going to find out your handbags were missing and as far as I know you can even open police involvement for a birkin. Is your right to have as many bags as you want (not selfish at all) because you worked for them. If your sister is not able to afford them, not a reason to steal either.", "NTA\n\nYour parents suck.  Your sister sucks.  No matter how wealthy or poor you are, your property is your property.  No one but you has any right to it.  No matter how wealthy or poor you are, you have no right to anyone else's property.  Period.", "NTA.  I can't imagine the gall - going downstairs crying because she got caught stealing!!!", "I think I would be concerned because with that sense of entitlement, I would wonder if your sister is also shoplifting? \nThe high dollar value of what she stole makes me wonder if she needs money for something and was planning on selling them? \nIt\u2019s absolutely infuriating when close family takes the side of someone who is doing some thing that\u2019s wrong and possibly criminal. \nShe should have asked you for a bag or money - if that\u2019s what she really wanted. In my opinion, that would\u2019ve been the correct thing to do.\nMaybe it\u2019s time for a family intervention to find out what\u2019s really going on with her and if she\u2019s OK? at least that will distract your family from the bag stealing incident and put the Focus back on your sister.", "You should not have to even ask. Instant NTA! She was stealing, and you having a lot of something does not give her right to take it.", "NTA and never let that thief in your house again.  From now on you can call her thief whenever you see her and refer to her as the thief on any conversations.  No one should be taking her side as there is no excuse for trying to steal.", "NTA", "NTA", "This. As for people thinking it\u2019s \u201cSnobby \u201c to collect bags, well people collect all kinds of things that are expensive but aren\u2019t necessarily \u201cworth\u201d a lot intrinsically. Look at baseball cards (cardboard). \n\nGo no contact with your sister and give your parents a lecture on theft and let them know they need to apologize before they get to see the baby. NTA.", "Your sister is a thief - stealing from you =family on top of it and whoever took her side is an AH. \n\nI would send them a Link with the value of said bags (including your sister) and warn her I'd she tries again you will call the police. As far as I know designer bags are priced in the thousands of $ so it's a felony theft and she'll go to jail . Send them this information about the felony theft too.\n\nNTA", "Definitely time to put a lock on the closet and lock anything else up that you want to keep when she\u2019s in your house", "She came prepared to steal from you and carried out the deed. \n\nShe should never have house visiting privileges again. \n\nAny time you\u2019d parents push her to be lenient, tell them they can invite sister to take THEIR possessions and that not calling the police is all the concession she\u2019ll get. And keep that camera footage in case something else goes missing.", "That erases from my mind that she was potentially going to pawn them for money, and would have just kept them and then brazenly carried them about all like, \"oh yea, I thrifted these\\~\" or some such. Good thing you caught her, because god damn that would have been an agonizing experience to witness.", "Why aren't you reporting this to the police?\n\nIt seems like she needs a proper reality check", "Many people who are generous to their loved ones don't get repaid with theft. It's completely unreasonable to blame OP for their sister's behavior.", "They are already expensive enough, you don\u2019t need to wildly exaggerate the price even further.", "You should if they're thieving brats...", "NTA And I would tell her that next time, I'd be pressing charges!!", "You are financially independent. You don't need your family and they are just going to suck blood from you until you die.", "NTA\n\nIf she left you could have had her arrested for theft. Hell, you might have been able to have her arrested before she even left. I don't doubt for a minute the kids were meant to be a distraction, without her even telling them.", "NTA. Your sister and parents are though. How can they be ok with her stealing from you?", "NTA, they're your property, simple as that.\n\nI have no idea how much designer handbags cost but it would seem worthwhile to drop an Air Tag into a pocket of each one of them.", "WTH?!? No you are not the AH!!! She has no right to steal anything from you. Or even being in that room to begin with. How entitled can she be? And your parents taking her side?!? Why do they enable her stealing? If you are supporting them financially, stop doing that and go NC for a while. And make sure they don\u2019t have spare keys to your house.", "NTA. I was going to ask if your sister had some sort of disorder like Klepto, but I would think she would be more stealthy if that were the case. \n\nI'm not sure how the dynamics in your family work, but since you've sent the video to the family chat, and she immediately left it, it's up to them if they want to continue to support her. Either way, I recommend you cut her off and cut off anyone who thinks you did something wrong by not allowing her to steal from you.", "NTA. Locks. On your closet or bedroom door.", "I'm getting tired of reading these obviously NTA posts. There are so many of them. I'm starting to think most of the people posting on here are just attention seeking assholes.", "NTA, and you need to ban your sister from your house.  If mom and dad can't see the problem here, I'd let them know they aren't welcome, either.  They sure as hell wouldn't be anywhere near that new grandchild, and I'd explain to them in real short words why not.\n\nWhat is wrong with people??", "If you had wanted, you could have let her steal them and then pressed charges. Depending on what she stole they could have been pretty serious! Obviously that would be a bit harsh, but some people would have done that. Your handling of it was extremely mild. NTA", "NTA, I would have thrown that thief out like I was Uncle Phil and she was Jazz", "OP\nYou are sadly not going to hear the end of this. \nI am so sorry. \n\nYou are seen as a doormat for your sister and parents. And your relatives will follow the others lead since they will feel they know you best. \n\nThese types of people never learn unless they are FORCED to face consequences. The truth is that you are not going change their minds. If they do change it it will be because they have no other choice. You need a wall safe for your jewels and important documents. NEVER SAY YOU EVEN OWN IT.\n\nThen you will need a lock on your closet door. Sad but necessary or at least in your bedroom door. \n\nYou then need to file a police report and actually follow through.\nYou seem like a nice person and there lies your problem. You are nice. You don't want drama and you don't want to fight. You are in the right and you were second guessing yourself. Familial ties cloud your judgement when the answer is easy. \n\nStip being nice. \nFile a report with the police. Follow it through.\nCut off toxic family and live for yourself and your growing family. Don't allow cancerous people to stay in your life. You and your baby deserve better. Pls do something about this. Don't be a pushover. \n\nI'm rooting for you.", "Hello, the reason as to why I posted asking if I was TA was because it might be snobby of me to have so many bags + refusing to give any to my sister even when she is struggling, and how the 5 most important people to me are siding with her. That is why.", "Omg hahahah this was sooo funnyy\ud83d\ude02. But yeah I agree.", "So they agree with her stealing? Good lord \nI would never allow them in my house ever again.", "Memory storage is cheap, take lots of photos of the outside AND the inside to show the condition of each one. Do the research to determine what to show to prove each one is an original and not a knock-off.  \n\nIf you ever have a problem these will show what you have and it's condition. Most people don't have that many purses so the photos will show you do and will make it easier to show which are missing. \n\nStore a copy away from your house in case of fire or a snooping sis taking a purse and the photos so you can't prove you owned it.", "When someone already steals from you, and keep giving them things. It makes them think that stealing is ok. If someone steals from you and ask for money, you point them to the thing they stole, you don't just give them money.\n\nSo yes, it is OP's fault in continuing to give her stealing sister money", "Where did I say this was her fault? She didn't make the sister do anything but these are significant valuables. Do you know how much a new birkin bag costs???? It is more than I make in a year. I mean I hope she at least has insurance. What if kids got in there and wanted to play around and damaged something?"]}
