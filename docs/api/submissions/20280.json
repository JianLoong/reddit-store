Keep in mind that the cheapest Birkin is $15k or so, and the other items you have to buy to get the chance to buy it are expensive as well.  The only other way to get a bag directly is to enter the lottery at the flagship Paris store (before Covid you\u2019d have to line up early in the morning) to get an appointment to buy one.  \nOf course, you can also buy them on the secondhand market, although it\u2019s possible to get a fake and if it\u2019s real, it will probably cost more than retail.", "Sounds like Birkin could create world peace with importance like that!
