Pardon me, but your sisters a weirdo. I mean, you HELP her out and she\u2019s stealing from you? Talk about biting the freaking hand that feeds you, geez.", "NTA don't invite her over anymore.

Even worse is her reaction and attempt to twist blame onto you for finding out.", "Anyone who took her side over being caught stealing from family you should be leery of too.  Sorry it's all family.", "NTA, of course. She's a thief!\n\nStop inviting her to your house.\n\nAnd as for the members of your family who are taking her side, tell them they're defending a thief.\n\nHaving said that, your post is confusing.

It's always the precursor to something bad and/or illegal going' down. Hell no. And in your own house? Nuh-uh. And Birkin, Chanel and Dior to boot? No way in hell. F#ck that.

Glad you have cameras!", "   You don't have to justify what you spend your money on. It sounds like the people who took her side are just as bad as she is or are possibly jealous of your success. Maybe it's time to leave the enablers and the thief behind and focus on your real family. Those others sound unhinged. \n    Congratulations on the baby. Too bad the party was ruined for you and your poor husband. He must love you deeply to put up with your family. Please disconnect with them before it affects your relationship\n\nPs.

Seriously, it doesn't matter if it's a $1k bag or a $1 keychain. She stole it because of her jealousy.

It's not the Bags, I saw you said they represent your achievements and I get that because I'm the same. Do your parents know how much these actually cost? I don't love in the US but I'm guessing that amount of theft would be a Felony or Grand Theft?", "Your mom and dad took WHAT side? That she\u2019s allowed to commit grand theft in your house? She could get into a shit ton of legal trouble here. NTA of course.", "NTA. She's a thief and she for caught. Good for you. Personally, I didn't get the shoe and purse gene so it's not something I would ever spend a ton of money on. But it makes you happy and you can afford it, so go for it.

Do not be surprised if she may have stolen stuff from her own friends too\n\nMoving forward do not invite her back to the house. If she can steal your handbags what is it gonna be next time? Money? Or even a piece of jewellery? If she wanted one of the bags she should have asked you\n\nOP, don't just have the cameras installed or have newer locks.
