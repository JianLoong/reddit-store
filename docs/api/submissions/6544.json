You two are both stressed - you with more school and him with more childcare.  This sounds like a fight born out of stress and fatigue with everyone just lashing out. Take a breather and tell him you want to talk about it when you're both feeling calmer. Nobody's really wrong but he needs to realize what stepping up while you're busy means. And sometimes it will be you stepping up when he's busy.  This is how partnership works, not by keeping score but by acting as a team. And sometimes you thank the other person for doing something they should do anyway, just to keep the peace (but honestly I see why you didn't if the house was such a mess). But NTA", "NTA. This sounds like a typical part of being young and raising kids with a partner. Sometimes the workload is lopsided. I'm sure there will come a time when you are doing the lion's share of parenting, will he be thanking you for that?", "NTA. I never understand why some parents think it's an achievement to be alone with their kids. A marriage is a partnership and sometimes you have to pick up the slack to help the other parent. The kids are in daycare / preschool so it's not like he's with them 24/7. You shouldn't have to thank someone for being a baseline parent.", "NTA, he is a parent and an adult. Parenting and cleaning up are his jobs also.", "INFO: does he thank you every time you have the children by yourself?", "I\u2019ve said this before on a different sub. As a father, I am not babysitting my children. I\u2019m their father. I\u2019m raising them. That includes doing housework. Definitely NTA. Your husband needs to join the 21st century.", "NAH really. This is just normal parent bickering. \n\nYou both could be nicer to each other but it\u2019s a stressful time and understandable that tensions ran high. \n\nI don\u2019t know that you have to thank him for taking care of the kids but you could appreciate the fact that he took care of the kids and worked and there wasn\u2019t time to clean the house. He could appreciate how exhausted you are working so much this week. \n\nThe fact is that you both did things that you had to do which left you feeling exhausted at the end of the day.  Nobody goofed off or lazed around. Nobody went and had drinks with buddies. Now you have two exhausted parents and chores needing to be done. It happens. Do what you can without heaping expectations on each other.", "No, I don't think you're an AH for not thanking your husband everytime he's watching the kids himself but you sure do have a lot of expectations. And I get the vibe that you're not very appreciative of what goes on, which makes you an AH\n\nI work remotely often as well, and there should be NO expectation that I am cleaning the house on a break. I rarely take a break, but if I do it's to eat or actually take a moment to myself because after work I have absolutely no alone or downtime once I pick up my son. It's mentally draining. Ever since my partner started working 2nd shift, I am more irritable and more exhausted because I work all day and then am sole caregiver all night. \n\nSometimes it's easier or hard to get things done when kids are around, as I am sure you know. He's probably just as exhausted by working all day, and then being alone with the kids at night. Walking through the door and immediately complaining about things that weren't done is rude af - instead, I'd probably ask \"How was your day?\" And probably assume it was a damn rough one.", "NTA. Would he thank you for mothering? No. Why are you thanking him for fathering?", "ES / NAH?\n\nI'm going to make an assumption that your husband has had a busy day that includes a lot of meetings, if that's the case, from my own experience taking time out for anything at that point will be difficult.  On the other hand, if he had an easy day, then yes he could take some time to sort things out.\n\nAlso just want to point out that this is the 3rd day out of a 10 day marathon, so this is probably a new situation for you.  You really need to talk and figure out what is realistically feasible for both of you.\n\nESH - If you're both sitting around in your own worlds only thinking about what needs to be done individually to satisfy a 50/50 work split.\n\nNAH - If you actually sit down and communicate how you can both help each other make it work.", "NAH. You're both very stressed and division of labor and childcare are even more stressful topics. He wants to be appreciated but you are correct that parenting your children should be a baseline. It's also not unreasonable for him to expect some assistance with housework even though you were working out of the home because he worked in the home while watching the children.\n\nTbh you guys should sit down and discuss needs and expectations for the typical division of labor as well as unusual circumstances like you currently have where one of you may need to temporarily take on more work.", "So, I would say NTA but also your husband is NTA. \nBut I do want to know. You said he works full-time. And I am only asking this because apparently there are different hours for that... How many hours does your husband work? And/or what times? Are his hours flexible? Is he actually working those hours? Or more or less? I don't mean it in any mean way but WFH has very different time/work meanings...\n\n\nAlso, you are a full-time student... How many classes do you take and how many hours is that? Do you have more than once those kind of crazy 10 work-day things or is it a one time thing or sometimes but a different amount of days?\n\nAnd what are the hours for the preschool?\n\nAnd how is you usual?", "NTA, but your husband is also NTA. The truth is that when a situation becomes \u201clopsided\u201d and stressful, the person with the heavy side can get resentful with the weight of it all when you have a partner but they\u2019re just not there. It\u2019s something communication and commiseration for both sides can help ease. You knew This big event was happening, setting expectations on both sides is important, so that there\u2019s a clear understanding and a light at the end of that tunnel.\n\nYou, even with this big event, are still a member of this household. So, while you are exhausted, pitching in to do the dishes (but not everything) is not unreasonable. Just as it is not unreasonable to expect a husband to pitch into the family household he is a part of even if he were to work insane hours outside of the house. \n\nYour husband doesn\u2019t need to be thanked for being the parent he is supposed to be for his kids, but he does need to be acknowledged for taking the extra weight during this stressful time, just as you should be were the situation reversed. \n\nAnd that is the whole point: if the roles were reversed, what would you expect, need, and how would you feel? That is what he needs, and hopefully he would give you the same back (if not, that\u2019s a whole other issue. If he has big events where everything is dumped on you, and he doesn\u2019t help, participate, or appreciate, and you felt this was just turning the tables - that\u2019s a problem that\u2019s just flipped over instead of solved.)", "ESH/NAH. You're both busy and stressed. You obviously have an intense time with job stuff right now. He's picking up some of the slack by doing childcare on his own (outside of the regular childcare hours) on top of his regular job. Should he be doing that for you? Absolutely, marriage is about sacrificing for others and helping them when they're going through a lot as you currently are. But you're coming across as self-centered and ungrateful here. I work from home and it's not a simple matter of taking a few minutes to clean and wash dishes while the kids play. Balancing job and kids and house is exhausting. There are lots of times my hubby comes home to find a messy house because I just couldn't keep up. And his typical response is to thank me for doing everything I do, especially for caring for our children. I get that these are your hubby's kids just as much as they're yours, and maybe he shouldn't be insisting on recognition, but I don't see why you're unwilling to say a simple thanks for the way he's stepping up while you're unable to do what you usually do.", "YTA. \n\nYou're right in that he shouldn't be thanked for being an active parent but you can thank him for the reality that he's been doing the heavy lifting while you're doing this hackathon which will span 10 days. And that's the reality of the situation here, he's doing the bulk of the work with the kiddos while also working full days. \n\nTruth be told, I think you're stressed and can't see the forest through the trees.", "NTA but every time he is \"babysitting\" his own kids give him some pocketmoney.\n\nif he is a little bit smart, he would understand the hint...his own hint", "NAH - you're both stressed, for different reasons, and thanking someone for something they've done, even if it's something \"expected\", is a nice way to combat potentially feeling taken for granted. \nCould you afford for a maid/cleaner a couple of times this week, to take the pressure off you both? Nothing wrong with outsourcing when time is at a premium.", "ESH, but with you being the bigger one. Sorry, he's working from home AND taking care of the kids, AND you want him to clean up the house? Are you insane? This is absolutely crazy.", "NTA he\u2019s a parent, he\u2019s supposed to spend time watching his own kids. Wanting praise for that just speaks to him thinking it\u2019s not \u201chis job\u201d to take care of them, and that\u2019s not okay.", "Everybody sucks.\n\nYou don\u2019t get a free pass at home because YOU chose to go back to school. Having kids and going back to school is an intentional choice and you don\u2019t get to escape your family responsibilities. And he isn\u2019t some hero for spending three hours a night with his own children. You both seem to have bitten off more than you can chew. You either need to learn to share this load better or rethink your enrollment. This is how resentment starts.\n\nIf he is working full time AND taking care of the kids afterwards then you can go to school AND do a load of dishes when you get home. Tbh you both kind of sound entitled. You both chose to have kids and you both seem to want to escape the consequences that come with that choice and live as if you don\u2019t have those responsibilities.", "NTA.\n\nThe only person who is ungrateful and not appreciative enough in all of this is your husband. \n\nHe has ridiculous expectations and needs to become more mature and responsible ASAP.\n\nYou\u2018re doing the best you can, and he\u2018s not the hero he thinks he is.", "ESH. No, you shouldn\u2019t have to thank your husband every time he looks after your children. That\u2019s what parents do. However, he did work all day and look after three small children and you came in and complained about the apartment being messy. Did you take any time to consider that he may have had a very long tiring day as well?", "ESH.\nHe should have talked to you about his \"expectation\" that you help with the cleanup.\n\nBut you don't get a pass - just because he's working from home doesn't mean he can \"take time to wash dishes\". When I am WFH, I am WORKING. I don't just drop off to do other things because I am AT WORK.", "NAH. You've both got very busy lives and it would be good to have a deeper conversation and a better understanding of what he'd take on during busy season in school and what you would take on later on to make up for it\n\nI don't really believe in forced gratitude between life partners but it does look like your husband did take on a lot while you were busy with school and a gesture of gratitude wouldn't hurt since you're unable to do any house work at the moment", "Is school a new endeavor? Seems kinda silly to have kids when you are both not available. 2 and 4 and coming home at 8:30pm? And a dad that works all day. That great for development. \n\nESH you for coming home and complaining instantly and him for thinking he needs to be thanks for taking care of his own kids. What does he need a gold star for doing what\u2019s expected?", "ESH\n\nHim for \"balancing the scales\" out of spite. You for not appreciating him for doing the extra work. \n\nThere's a lot missing from this post as clearly we have no idea what the usual balance is of the household chores and parenting is like, nor do we know how much you both knew this 10 day thing was coming up and how you prepared for it. It sounds like he had a hard day and felt alone in the adulting, it sounds like you had a hard day at work. Apologize for the snark and work together to pick up the house so you can reset for the next crazy day. Work as a team, it's kind of the whole point in being married.", ">I told him (in an admittedly snarky way) that I shouldn\u2019t have to thank him for parenting his own children.\n\nYou forgot the word \"ALONE\" and \"over many days\".  \nYTA. You are ungrateful. Yes, it's his job to care for the kids, but it's yours too, and you fail to be there. The least you can do is be grateful that he allows you to prioritize your career, and accept that you don't get a pass on house chore just because you work.", ">am I the asshole for not always expressing my appreciation for him being with the children we made together?\n\nHave you ever thanked him for the extra work he does to accommodate your busy schedule?\n\nIt doesn't seem like the issue is really \"you haven't thanked me enough\" so much as \"It doesn't feel like you appreciate the *extra* work that I do\"\n\nIt sounds like you husband might have been tired as well, but when you came home you essentially said \"The work you've been doing isn't good enough\" which can be frustrating since he is already doing more work than normal to accommodate you.\n\n~~Y T A~~ NAH. You were both busy. Communication, however, could be improved.\n\n~~I would revise my assessment, however, if you usually do more housework/childcare during times when your schedules are normal. Does it seem like he is slacking off the rest of the time, or does it just seem like he isn't picking up enough slack when you are busy?~~", "YTA. If this had been written by a man it would be raining YTAS.\n\nworking from home does not Mean he isnt working, and you having a demanding crunch does not mean he has to pick up the slack id you haven't talked about it.", "NTA.  Your husband is lazy.  He's not doing his share.  Watching the kids is part of his responsibility.  You don't get rewarded for doing that.  You're gonna have to train him better.", "NTA. Yes things can be stressful when things get lopsided but it sounds like the expectation for you to clean was never communicated or negotiated and it's day 3 of 10. It's lopsided but you're also contributing and there is a very short end date. Maybe you two can communicate expectations better but honestly, pulling extra for ten days when need arises doesn't need giant cookies.", "ESH. Thank each other every time. Appreciate each other.", "YTA.\nHe's not asking for a thank you for performing his typical duties within the household. He's asking for a thank you for going above and beyond those typical duties to accommodate something YOU want to do. Absolutely he deserves some recognition for the extra effort he is putting into your household for your benefit.\n\nAt the very least this is not something you should be fighting over. Thank him and move on.", "NAH... Or ESH depending on your pov.\n\nYou're tired, he's tired, these situations are gonna come up when you both decide full time endeavours that eat up so much of your time. This is the reality of parenting so you and your husband better buckle in because you've got another 15+yrs at least of it until they up and leave the nest.\n\nHe worked all day, you were at college/ Uni all day. I assume you left out the part where you expressed disappointment to your husband after coming home to a bit of a mess (because I don't see how else this whole argument started). Just as much as I'm sure you wouldn't be particularly very happy if he came home and complained about the state of the house after you'd worked all day, I'm sure he wasn't either. From what you yourself laid out, he's picking up some of your slack for not being there. So at the end of your intense project, yeah a simple thank you would go a long way. That doesn't mean you have to thank him every day, he's a parent as well and if he didn't want the responsibility he shouldn't have had kids, but the last thing he needs is you coming home and questioning the manner in which he's carrying your end of the couch for this period of time.\n\nYou both need to learn to communicate better, fighting each other instead of working together is the kindling of divorce.\n\nINFO: how old are you both?", "YTA working remotely and getting\"home all day\" doesn't mean he has the time to do a bunch of dishes. You admit yourself that you've been absent for the last week and he has gone above and beyond with the childcare. Like yes, that's partly his responsibility but you could show some appreciation for the fact that he's doing more than his fair share right now and not berate him for things falling a bit behind.\n\nIf the roles were reversed would you want some extra gratitude?", "ESH\n\nHe\u2019s picking up extra slack. He\u2019s not used to having them alone, organizing dinner, and cleaning\u2014he\u2019s just trying to keep the kids alive and survive after his full day of work to support your career path. Seems to me that a thank you would be reasonable.\n\nBut then I\u2019m the kind of person who thanks my partner and my step son a lot. If partner pays for dinner, I think him. He makes dinner, I thank him. He takes out the garbage, swaps the sheets, walks the dog, gets me a glass of water\u2026.I thank him. With the exception of getting me a glass of water, these are all things that are both of our \u201cjobs\u201d but I\u2019ve found that things are much more balanced when I acknowledge and thank effort. \n\nAnd when I have to work late\u2014unplanned\u2014and he picks up something extra that I had planned\u2014like making dinner\u2014I give extra thanks. Because he really is making it possible for me to do my job by picking up some slack when I can\u2019t be available. \n\nLastly, I work from home and I realize that WFH varies by job. But when I\u2019m working, I\u2019m WORKING. I\u2019m usually in meetings or preparing for meetings. I *might* have time to swap laundry from the washer to the dryer but that\u2019s about it. I can\u2019t be away from my computer long enough to wash some dishes or vacuum or whatever. Any cleaning I want to do has to be done when I\u2019m not working. So it gets old to me to hear \u201cthey work from home, they could do X\u201d\u2026no. Not if you actually have a job to do.", "NAH, looking after 2 young kids alone is stressful, especially when they are grumpy and impossible to please. Many people will snap at their partner in that situation; which is a lot better than snapping at the kids I can assure you\n\nJust need some communication\u2026 appreciate your situation is difficult but the occasional text to check in on hubby to see how the kids are is likely to help him feel a smidge better and it would keep you connected to home", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Normally our son is in childcare, but this week we realised fairly late that this is closed due to the holidays. As a result, I've had to watch our son while I work, which is a fairly challenging thing to do as he's an emotional toddler who wants a lot of attention. I am also expecting our second baby, so my energy levels in general have taken a bit of a hit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving my son over the last few days and having to balance this with work has been exhausting. I haven't been able to get much work done and although I've had a quick tidy up, I am absolutely exhausted. If my husband came home today and started making comments about what I hadn't done, I would probably be very frustrated too. Your husband may work from home but he's taking on additional responsibility by caring for your children alongside this. They're his children too of course, but he has an additional responsibility to his employer and probably has tasks to complete at work, so it isn't realistic to expect him to do everything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're under a lot of pressure at work and I totally appreciate that you don't want to get home and fix the mess that they have all created, but it's all about doing what you can. I am sure your husband doesn't expect you to clear the apartment from top to bottom but it may have been useful for you to do a smaller job such as take the trash out or do the dishes. If your husband if anything like me, he'll be overtly aware that there are household jobs outstanding, and you picking up on them the moment you walk through the door isn't helping anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes I get annoyed at my husband because I feel he doesn't recognise what I do for our family, but I know that realistically I am just as guilty of this. It can be hard looking at the bigger picture when you're trying to balance daily responsibilities, your career, family, etc, but it really does help to take a step back and remember that your partner is a human being and will be dealing with the same stressors that you are.

My husband stays home with the kids so he doesn\u2019t get a thank you for that everyday, but if I have a work call or something outside our normal schedule, it\u2019s very much a kind gesture to show appreciation for him supporting my side business and the time investment needed to get it off the ground. Its just about being a supportive partner, which he\u2019s doing for you by trying to take care of whatever he can while you\u2019re working late.", "That's just pointless to bring up at this time", "His hours could be flexible if he wanted them to be. He typically works 8-5. Unlike when I worked remote, he does nothing but work during that time. He has the focus of a hawk. I\u2019m kind of jealous. \n\nBefore I went back to school and when I was working full time from home, I would do laundry in between meetings, cook dinner, etc. Still got my work done, but it wasn\u2019t a 9-5 straight through kind of thing if that makes sense. \n\nThis is a one time thing for the month of January. The rest of my classes follow a more typical schedule\u20142 hours twice a week, etc.\u2014and allow me to be much more hands on. Going to school has actually allowed me to spend more time with everyone. It\u2019s been really, really nice. \n\nThe kids are school/daycare from ~8-5:30 (all day).", "Fair point. Appreciate your feedback.", "Also he seems to be the sole provider of this household.\n\n\nNot saying ,that going to school In order to being able to provide In the future, isnt important, but currently it seems like he is earning all the money, takes care of the kids more and Is also expected to do the houseworks In the meanwhile. \n\nI dont really understand where he should find the time to do all that.he is not SAHP, he is working full time and Also taki g care of the kiddos", "the children are at daycare and preschool, so daddy aka babysitter has free time", ">NTA but every time he is \"babysitting\" his own kids give him some pocketmoney.\n\nFrom what I understand, OP is a student.

It isn't like the kids are neglected.", "Just to add more context: he was with the kids by himself for a total three hours yesterday. It was the two of us for every other moment they were not at school.", "Is he expected to thank her for cleaning up the mess he made with the kids?", "Fair points. \n\nI typically do the majority of the housework. I just can\u2019t do as much this week. \n\nAnd yes, I have thanked him in the past for picking up the slack. I should have led with that last night though. We made up last night, but this is something (the need to thank him for child care stuff) that\u2019s come up before.", "He's a husband... Not a dog", "But he's working AND taking care of the children. It isn't realistic to expect one person to manage household tasks, watch children and also complete their work tasks. I don't think the husband is lazy (I mean, he might be, but I didn't get that from the above).", "We\u2019re in our mid-30s.", "No, but I don\u2019t expect it so it doesn\u2019t bother me. I suppose if his plans changed suddenly and he couldn\u2019t come home until after the kids went to bed, I\u2019d appreciate a thank you. I imagine that this was going on for him last night. What irritated me was that he didn\u2019t clean at all because he wanted me to do that in exchange for taking care of the kids.", "I think that\u2019s right. I\u2019m making this my 2023 resolution.", "No it's not. If he wanted to be acknowledged he should acknowledged his wife. The shocker that it is discovering you have to parent your own children", "Does he thank you every time you look after them?", "The sole bread winner thing is definitely real. It\u2019s been a real team effort to actually prioritize his job to keep us afloat while also allowing me space to study. We\u2019ve managed to keep things balanced for the most part. \n\nI do most of the housework though. We typically spend most of our free time with the kids.", "Dads aren't babysitters, they're parents.", ">so daddy aka babysitter has free time\n\nHe has time to work at his job. Just because he can work remotely doesn't mean he is free.", "Oh yeah, all that free time people typically have during their full time jobs. Smh.", "You\u2019re totally right a 2 year old is much better off in school with strangers all day not seeing their mother except for drop off. \n\nStudies show the first years of development are greatly impacted by learning from their parents directly. \n\nI\u2019ll just never understand why people have kids then don\u2019t have the time for them/have other people raise them.", "Doesn't matter. Right now, he is picking up YOUR slack, and you won't even say a little \"thank you\" and expect him to pick even more slack.", "It's almost the busiest time of day when you have young kids. To run through his day, he started work at 8, finished at 5 with maybe a break to eat. Went and got the kids from daycare or school, brought them home by 5:30. Then in that total 3 hours he had to get them dinner, get them showered, brush their teeth and get them settled down and in bed asleep. He shouldn't need thanking for parenting but you should be appreciative of how much extra work that 3 hours is and that he is going to be tired and not complain he isn't cleaning as well.", "Yes. They should be appreciative of each other whether they are supposed to be doing these things or not.", ".... you mean, her house chores ?\n\nYou shouldn't have to thank someone for doing the chores they are **supposed to do**. I mean, OP lives there, it's normal she pick up some house chores. \n\nBut if your partner takes on some of your chores (like, you know, the whole child care for 10 days), then yes, they definitely deserves a \"thank you\".", ">I typically do the majority of the housework.\n\nDoes this split typically seem fair to you? Does you schooling typically seem more part-time/less intense than his job so you are comfortable taking on more household work since he supports the family's income?\n\n>the need to thank him for child care stuff\n\nI don't think you need to thank him for childcare, but it is good to appreciate when he is putting in extra effort into the shared job of childcare. It is a team project, and it is nice to know that your teammates recognize the value of the work that you do.\n\nIt sounds like to him when you complained about the dishes/toys etc... he was hearing that you thought he had been free during the day and was just too lazy to do them. In his mind, however, he was busy during the day with work and then with childcare.\n\nYou were both busy during the day, and neither of you had time to deal with the shared chores of dishes and tidying after your children. I will change my judgement to NAH because the fair arrangement would be for you both to take care of cleaning. \n\nIt isn't fair for the cleaning to be solely your responsibility, but if he is also busy it isn't fair for it to be solely his.", "gotcha.  and to be honest - women never expect it, but doesn't mean we shouldn't be thanked if that's what men expect.  I'd ask him the last time he thanked you - and see if it gets through.  And expecting you clean in exchange of him parenting is also pretty childish.  It's not like you were sitting on your sofa all day!  Hopefully you two can just sit down and talk without the emotions of the moment.  Good luck!", "No, almost never. But it doesn\u2019t upset me because I see it as my job. I\u2019m thinking that assumption might be a blind spot?", "> I do most of the housework though\n\nAh yes, I didnt mean it literally that he would be doing most of the housework, It was more of a remark about where he would find the time if he is working and Also taking care of the kids In the meanwhile(assuming that he was still working while watching over the kiddos).\n\nBuuut if his work day was already over , when he was alone with the kiddos, then there most likely should be a opportunity window or two here and there to do some housework too.\n\n\nBut tbh this sounds like Basic problems that People have when their kids are that young. Couple years later making sure the kids are fine shouldnt require 100%undivided attention anymore.", "daddy sees himself a babysitter, so I wrote:\n\ndaddy AKA babysitter", "He is not \"picking up her slack\" though, as he left all house chores for her. So he just substituted chores with caring for the kids", "You mean THEIR house chores, just like the kids are THEIR kids, surely?\n\nI mean, you can\u2019t have it both ways, either they\u2019re equally responsible for their shared responsibilities or they\u2019re not?\n\nI mean, if you shouldn\u2019t have to thank someone for doing the chores they\u2019re supposed to do then equally you shouldn\u2019t have to thank someone for parenting the children they\u2019re supposed to parent, right?", "HER chores?

You pick up slack if your partner is busy or has a hard time and the other way around. And yeah, a thank you is nice, but OP could have done that later, when she was less stressed and exhausted. Demanding a thank you directly seems a bit much... Seems like they just need a good conversation after they all had some sleep :-)\n\nNAH", ">Does your schooling typically seem less intense than his job?\n\nYep, that\u2019s exactly right. I\u2019ve taken on more responsibilities than normal because I have the bandwidth to do so.\n\nI guess what grinds my gears is that when I am with the kids while he\u2019s away, I nearly always make sure the kids pick up after themselves and the dishes are put away. I want both of us to feel like this 500 sqft apartment is a haven when we come home. I don\u2019t expect thanks, but I guess I am expecting reciprocation? That might be unfair of me.\n\nAnd you\u2019re absolutely spot on re: gratitude. I could attribute the grumpiness to the day I had, but the point remains that it\u2019s important to work together.", "I have never once in 9 years thanked my other half for being a parent. He\u2019s never thanked me and it\u2019s never expected. \nDoes he want a sticker or a gold medal? He\u2019s basically done the bare minimum possible and expects to be thanked, that\u2019s not right.", "Alternatively daddy sees himself as unexpectedly a single parent.", ">you shouldn\u2019t have to thank someone for doing the chores they\u2019re supposed to do\n\nI mean ... I do. \n\nIt might be a cultural thing but I think it is polite to thank people when they do something you benefit from even if it was their responsibility to do it. It helps people know that their work matters. \n\nIt's like if my coworker gets me a report I need. It was their job to do it, and their responsibility, but I still say thank you because I want them to know their work matters.", ">nearly always make sure the kids pick up after themselves and the dishes are put away. I want both of us to feel like this 500 sqft apartment is a haven when we come home. I don\u2019t expect thanks, but I guess I am expecting reciprocation?\n\nWhat you want is reasonable. It is possible that he has a weakness in this area and has room to learn to be better at taking care of the children.\n\nDoes it seem like he is *constantly* overwhelmed when he needs to take care of the kids alone? Has the house been messy when you came back on previous days, or was this just a one off where he was particularly busy?", "But it\u2019s not unexpected. OP states they both knew the care was going to be a little lopsided during this time, but that she\u2019s still trying to help as much as she\u2019s able.", "It\u2019s pretty consistently this way. I think he struggles with balance in general."]}
