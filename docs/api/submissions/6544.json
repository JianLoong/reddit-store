You two are both stressed - you with more school and him with more childcare.  This sounds like a fight born out of stress and fatigue with everyone just lashing out. Take a breather and tell him you want to talk about it when you're both feeling calmer. Nobody's really wrong but he needs to realize what stepping up while you're busy means. And sometimes it will be you stepping up when he's busy.  This is how partnership works, not by keeping score but by acting as a team. And sometimes you thank the other person for doing something they should do anyway, just to keep the peace (but honestly I see why you didn't if the house was such a mess). But NTA", "NTA. This sounds like a typical part of being young and raising kids with a partner. Sometimes the workload is lopsided. I'm sure there will come a time when you are doing the lion's share of parenting, will he be thanking you for that?", "NTA. I never understand why some parents think it's an achievement to be alone with their kids. A marriage is a partnership and sometimes you have to pick up the slack to help the other parent. The kids are in daycare / preschool so it's not like he's with them 24/7. You shouldn't have to thank someone for being a baseline parent.", "NTA, he is a parent and an adult. Parenting and cleaning up are his jobs also.", "INFO: does he thank you every time you have the children by yourself?", "I\u2019ve said this before on a different sub. As a father, I am not babysitting my children. I\u2019m their father. I\u2019m raising them. That includes doing housework. Definitely NTA. Your husband needs to join the 21st century.", "NAH really. This is just normal parent bickering. \n\nYou both could be nicer to each other but it\u2019s a stressful time and understandable that tensions ran high. \n\nI don\u2019t know that you have to thank him for taking care of the kids but you could appreciate the fact that he took care of the kids and worked and there wasn\u2019t time to clean the house. He could appreciate how exhausted you are working so much this week. \n\nThe fact is that you both did things that you had to do which left you feeling exhausted at the end of the day.  Nobody goofed off or lazed around. Nobody went and had drinks with buddies. Now you have two exhausted parents and chores needing to be done. It happens. Do what you can without heaping expectations on each other.", "No, I don't think you're an AH for not thanking your husband everytime he's watching the kids himself but you sure do have a lot of expectations. And I get the vibe that you're not very appreciative of what goes on, which makes you an AH\n\nI work remotely often as well, and there should be NO expectation that I am cleaning the house on a break. I rarely take a break, but if I do it's to eat or actually take a moment to myself because after work I have absolutely no alone or downtime once I pick up my son. It's mentally draining. Ever since my partner started working 2nd shift, I am more irritable and more exhausted because I work all day and then am sole caregiver all night. \n\nSometimes it's easier or hard to get things done when kids are around, as I am sure you know. He's probably just as exhausted by working all day, and then being alone with the kids at night. Walking through the door and immediately complaining about things that weren't done is rude af - instead, I'd probably ask \"How was your day?\" And probably assume it was a damn rough one.", "NTA. Would he thank you for mothering? No. Why are you thanking him for fathering?", "ES / NAH?\n\nI'm going to make an assumption that your husband has had a busy day that includes a lot of meetings, if that's the case, from my own experience taking time out for anything at that point will be difficult.  On the other hand, if he had an easy day, then yes he could take some time to sort things out.\n\nAlso just want to point out that this is the 3rd day out of a 10 day marathon, so this is probably a new situation for you.  You really need to talk and figure out what is realistically feasible for both of you.\n\nESH - If you're both sitting around in your own worlds only thinking about what needs to be done individually to satisfy a 50/50 work split.\n\nNAH - If you actually sit down and communicate how you can both help each other make it work.", "NAH. You're both very stressed and division of labor and childcare are even more stressful topics. He wants to be appreciated but you are correct that parenting your children should be a baseline. It's also not unreasonable for him to expect some assistance with housework even though you were working out of the home because he worked in the home while watching the children.\n\nTbh you guys should sit down and discuss needs and expectations for the typical division of labor as well as unusual circumstances like you currently have where one of you may need to temporarily take on more work.", "So, I would say NTA but also your husband is NTA. \nBut I do want to know. You said he works full-time. And I am only asking this because apparently there are different hours for that... How many hours does your husband work? And/or what times? Are his hours flexible? Is he actually working those hours? Or more or less? I don't mean it in any mean way but WFH has very different time/work meanings...\n\n\nAlso, you are a full-time student... How many classes do you take and how many hours is that? Do you have more than once those kind of crazy 10 work-day things or is it a one time thing or sometimes but a different amount of days?\n\nAnd what are the hours for the preschool?\n\nAnd how is you usual?", "NTA, but your husband is also NTA. The truth is that when a situation becomes \u201clopsided\u201d and stressful, the person with the heavy side can get resentful with the weight of it all when you have a partner but they\u2019re just not there. It\u2019s something communication and commiseration for both sides can help ease. You knew This big event was happening, setting expectations on both sides is important, so that there\u2019s a clear understanding and a light at the end of that tunnel.\n\nYou, even with this big event, are still a member of this household. So, while you are exhausted, pitching in to do the dishes (but not everything) is not unreasonable. Just as it is not unreasonable to expect a husband to pitch into the family household he is a part of even if he were to work insane hours outside of the house. \n\nYour husband doesn\u2019t need to be thanked for being the parent he is supposed to be for his kids, but he does need to be acknowledged for taking the extra weight during this stressful time, just as you should be were the situation reversed. \n\nAnd that is the whole point: if the roles were reversed, what would you expect, need, and how would you feel? That is what he needs, and hopefully he would give you the same back (if not, that\u2019s a whole other issue. If he has big events where everything is dumped on you, and he doesn\u2019t help, participate, or appreciate, and you felt this was just turning the tables - that\u2019s a problem that\u2019s just flipped over instead of solved.)", "ESH/NAH. You're both busy and stressed. You obviously have an intense time with job stuff right now. He's picking up some of the slack by doing childcare on his own (outside of the regular childcare hours) on top of his regular job. Should he be doing that for you? Absolutely, marriage is about sacrificing for others and helping them when they're going through a lot as you currently are. But you're coming across as self-centered and ungrateful here. I work from home and it's not a simple matter of taking a few minutes to clean and wash dishes while the kids play. Balancing job and kids and house is exhausting. There are lots of times my hubby comes home to find a messy house because I just couldn't keep up. And his typical response is to thank me for doing everything I do, especially for caring for our children. I get that these are your hubby's kids just as much as they're yours, and maybe he shouldn't be insisting on recognition, but I don't see why you're unwilling to say a simple thanks for the way he's stepping up while you're unable to do what you usually do.", "YTA. \n\nYou're right in that he shouldn't be thanked for being an active parent but you can thank him for the reality that he's been doing the heavy lifting while you're doing this hackathon which will span 10 days. And that's the reality of the situation here, he's doing the bulk of the work with the kiddos while also working full days. \n\nTruth be told, I think you're stressed and can't see the forest through the trees.", "NTA but every time he is \"babysitting\" his own kids give him some pocketmoney.\n\nif he is a little bit smart, he would understand the hint...his own hint", "NAH - you're both stressed, for different reasons, and thanking someone for something they've done, even if it's something \"expected\", is a nice way to combat potentially feeling taken for granted. \nCould you afford for a maid/cleaner a couple of times this week, to take the pressure off you both? Nothing wrong with outsourcing when time is at a premium.", "ESH, but with you being the bigger one. Sorry, he's working from home AND taking care of the kids, AND you want him to clean up the house? Are you insane? This is absolutely crazy.", "NTA he\u2019s a parent, he\u2019s supposed to spend time watching his own kids. Wanting praise for that just speaks to him thinking it\u2019s not \u201chis job\u201d to take care of them, and that\u2019s not okay.", "Everybody sucks.\n\nYou don\u2019t get a free pass at home because YOU chose to go back to school. Having kids and going back to school is an intentional choice and you don\u2019t get to escape your family responsibilities. And he isn\u2019t some hero for spending three hours a night with his own children. You both seem to have bitten off more than you can chew. You either need to learn to share this load better or rethink your enrollment. This is how resentment starts.\n\nIf he is working full time AND taking care of the kids afterwards then you can go to school AND do a load of dishes when you get home. Tbh you both kind of sound entitled. You both chose to have kids and you both seem to want to escape the consequences that come with that choice and live as if you don\u2019t have those responsibilities.", "NTA.\n\nThe only person who is ungrateful and not appreciative enough in all of this is your husband. \n\nHe has ridiculous expectations and needs to become more mature and responsible ASAP.\n\nYou\u2018re doing the best you can, and he\u2018s not the hero he thinks he is.", "ESH. No, you shouldn\u2019t have to thank your husband every time he looks after your children. That\u2019s what parents do. However, he did work all day and look after three small children and you came in and complained about the apartment being messy. Did you take any time to consider that he may have had a very long tiring day as well?", "ESH.\nHe should have talked to you about his \"expectation\" that you help with the cleanup.\n\nBut you don't get a pass - just because he's working from home doesn't mean he can \"take time to wash dishes\". When I am WFH, I am WORKING. I don't just drop off to do other things because I am AT WORK.", "NAH. You've both got very busy lives and it would be good to have a deeper conversation and a better understanding of what he'd take on during busy season in school and what you would take on later on to make up for it\n\nI don't really believe in forced gratitude between life partners but it does look like your husband did take on a lot while you were busy with school and a gesture of gratitude wouldn't hurt since you're unable to do any house work at the moment", "Is school a new endeavor? Seems kinda silly to have kids when you are both not available. 2 and 4 and coming home at 8:30pm? And a dad that works all day. That great for development. \n\nESH you for coming home and complaining instantly and him for thinking he needs to be thanks for taking care of his own kids. What does he need a gold star for doing what\u2019s expected?", "ESH\n\nHim for \"balancing the scales\" out of spite. You for not appreciating him for doing the extra work. \n\nThere's a lot missing from this post as clearly we have no idea what the usual balance is of the household chores and parenting is like, nor do we know how much you both knew this 10 day thing was coming up and how you prepared for it. It sounds like he had a hard day and felt alone in the adulting, it sounds like you had a hard day at work. Apologize for the snark and work together to pick up the house so you can reset for the next crazy day. Work as a team, it's kind of the whole point in being married.", ">I told him (in an admittedly snarky way) that I shouldn\u2019t have to thank him for parenting his own children.\n\nYou forgot the word \"ALONE\" and \"over many days\".  \nYTA. You are ungrateful. Yes, it's his job to care for the kids, but it's yours too, and you fail to be there. The least you can do is be grateful that he allows you to prioritize your career, and accept that you don't get a pass on house chore just because you work.", ">am I the asshole for not always expressing my appreciation for him being with the children we made together?\n\nHave you ever thanked him for the extra work he does to accommodate your busy schedule?\n\nIt doesn't seem like the issue is really \"you haven't thanked me enough\" so much as \"It doesn't feel like you appreciate the *extra* work that I do\"\n\nIt sounds like you husband might have been tired as well, but when you came home you essentially said \"The work you've been doing isn't good enough\" which can be frustrating since he is already doing more work than normal to accommodate you.\n\n~~Y T A~~ NAH. You were both busy. Communication, however, could be improved.\n\n~~I would revise my assessment, however, if you usually do more housework/childcare during times when your schedules are normal. Does it seem like he is slacking off the rest of the time, or does it just seem like he isn't picking up enough slack when you are busy?~~", "YTA. If this had been written by a man it would be raining YTAS.\n\nworking from home does not Mean he isnt working, and you having a demanding crunch does not mean he has to pick up the slack id you haven't talked about it.", "NTA.  Your husband is lazy.  He's not doing his share.  Watching the kids is part of his responsibility.  You don't get rewarded for doing that.  You're gonna have to train him better.", "NTA. Yes things can be stressful when things get lopsided but it sounds like the expectation for you to clean was never communicated or negotiated and it's day 3 of 10. It's lopsided but you're also contributing and there is a very short end date. Maybe you two can communicate expectations better but honestly, pulling extra for ten days when need arises doesn't need giant cookies.", "ESH. Thank each other every time. Appreciate each other.", "YTA.\nHe's not asking for a thank you for performing his typical duties within the household. He's asking for a thank you for going above and beyond those typical duties to accommodate something YOU want to do. Absolutely he deserves some recognition for the extra effort he is putting into your household for your benefit.\n\nAt the very least this is not something you should be fighting over. Thank him and move on.", "NAH... Or ESH depending on your pov.\n\nYou're tired, he's tired, these situations are gonna come up when you both decide full time endeavours that eat up so much of your time. This is the reality of parenting so you and your husband better buckle in because you've got another 15+yrs at least of it until they up and leave the nest.\n\nHe worked all day, you were at college/ Uni all day. I assume you left out the part where you expressed disappointment to your husband after coming home to a bit of a mess (because I don't see how else this whole argument started). Just as much as I'm sure you wouldn't be particularly very happy if he came home and complained about the state of the house after you'd worked all day, I'm sure he wasn't either. From what you yourself laid out, he's picking up some of your slack for not being there. So at the end of your intense project, yeah a simple thank you would go a long way. That doesn't mean you have to thank him every day, he's a parent as well and if he didn't want the responsibility he shouldn't have had kids, but the last thing he needs is you coming home and questioning the manner in which he's carrying your end of the couch for this period of time.\n\nYou both need to learn to communicate better, fighting each other instead of working together is the kindling of divorce.\n\nINFO: how old are you both?", "YTA working remotely and getting\"home all day\" doesn't mean he has the time to do a bunch of dishes. You admit yourself that you've been absent for the last week and he has gone above and beyond with the childcare. Like yes, that's partly his responsibility but you could show some appreciation for the fact that he's doing more than his fair share right now and not berate him for things falling a bit behind.\n\nIf the roles were reversed would you want some extra gratitude?", "ESH\n\nHe\u2019s picking up extra slack. He\u2019s not used to having them alone, organizing dinner, and cleaning\u2014he\u2019s just trying to keep the kids alive and survive after his full day of work to support your career path. Seems to me that a thank you would be reasonable.\n\nBut then I\u2019m the kind of person who thanks my partner and my step son a lot. If partner pays for dinner, I think him. He makes dinner, I thank him. He takes out the garbage, swaps the sheets, walks the dog, gets me a glass of water\u2026.I thank him. With the exception of getting me a glass of water, these are all things that are both of our \u201cjobs\u201d but I\u2019ve found that things are much more balanced when I acknowledge and thank effort. \n\nAnd when I have to work late\u2014unplanned\u2014and he picks up something extra that I had planned\u2014like making dinner\u2014I give extra thanks. Because he really is making it possible for me to do my job by picking up some slack when I can\u2019t be available. \n\nLastly, I work from home and I realize that WFH varies by job. But when I\u2019m working, I\u2019m WORKING. I\u2019m usually in meetings or preparing for meetings. I *might* have time to swap laundry from the washer to the dryer but that\u2019s about it. I can\u2019t be away from my computer long enough to wash some dishes or vacuum or whatever. Any cleaning I want to do has to be done when I\u2019m not working. So it gets old to me to hear \u201cthey work from home, they could do X\u201d\u2026no. Not if you actually have a job to do.", "NAH, looking after 2 young kids alone is stressful, especially when they are grumpy and impossible to please. Many people will snap at their partner in that situation; which is a lot better than snapping at the kids I can assure you\n\nJust need some communication\u2026 appreciate your situation is difficult but the occasional text to check in on hubby to see how the kids are is likely to help him feel a smidge better and it would keep you connected to home", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Normally our son is in childcare, but this week we realised fairly late that this is closed due to the holidays. As a result, I've had to watch our son while I work, which is a fairly challenging thing to do as he's an emotional toddler who wants a lot of attention. I am also expecting our second baby, so my energy levels in general have taken a bit of a hit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving my son over the last few days and having to balance this with work has been exhausting. I haven't been able to get much work done and although I've had a quick tidy up, I am absolutely exhausted. If my husband came home today and started making comments about what I hadn't done, I would probably be very frustrated too. Your husband may work from home but he's taking on additional responsibility by caring for your children alongside this. They're his children too of course, but he has an additional responsibility to his employer and probably has tasks to complete at work, so it isn't realistic to expect him to do everything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're under a lot of pressure at work and I totally appreciate that you don't want to get home and fix the mess that they have all created, but it's all about doing what you can. I am sure your husband doesn't expect you to clear the apartment from top to bottom but it may have been useful for you to do a smaller job such as take the trash out or do the dishes. If your husband if anything like me, he'll be overtly aware that there are household jobs outstanding, and you picking up on them the moment you walk through the door isn't helping anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes I get annoyed at my husband because I feel he doesn't recognise what I do for our family, but I know that realistically I am just as guilty of this. It can be hard looking at the bigger picture when you're trying to balance daily responsibilities, your career, family, etc, but it really does help to take a step back and remember that your partner is a human being and will be dealing with the same stressors that you are.

And while that may sound silly without context, there's a good reason for it that I've come to, related to his mental health.", "This should really be the top comment. Well said!", "Being young and raising kids *and* your partner.\n\nWittle Hubby wants his gold star for doing the absolute bare minimum. *Slow clap* Don't humor your husband, OP. Tell him to grow tf up.", "Agreed here, I don't think it's necessary to thank him for taking care of the kids as it is his responsibility as much as it is OPs, but appreciation for handling the majority of the childcare, dinner, etc during a hectic time period would probably be useful. \n\nI was in a similar situation last month, my spouse's work was crazy busy (healthcare) and mine was not. I picked up a large portion of the childcare, cooking, cleaning, so they could come home and not have to worry. They were very appreciative of my effort and said so, and I appreciated that they voiced their appreciation. Small gestures like that can go a long way.\n\nI told them parenting to me, is like american football. Some weeks the team is running and throwing the ball well and it ends up being 50/50 run/pass. Some weeks the team can't run the ball and relies heavily on the pass game that week, and others, the passing game is trash and the team has to run the ball more. At the end of the day, the goal is to win (successful parenting), and just may require one side to carry load more than the other but at the end, it all comes out in a wash as long as the ultimate goal of taking care of kids and the house is done. \n\nOP and husband are both stressed, and tired, NAH.", "This should be the top comment.", "Exactly. Spot on.", "> thank him for taking care of the kids \n\nI wouldn't call that \"normal\" parent bickering.  At least I hope it isn't.  OP is right, he shouldn't be thanked for parenting his own children.\n\nAgree with everything else you said though.", "This isn\u2019t exactly applicable to this situation but I do thank my partner when they are able to cover for me. She does the same. I think expressing gratitude to your partner is good for the relationship.\n\nI think people on this sub have a black and white mentality that leads to statements like, \u201c You shouldn't have to thank someone for being a baseline parent\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s true that you shouldn\u2019t have to but wouldn\u2019t it be nice if you did?", "Ofc not, it\u2019s \u201cher job\u201d", "Ok, genuine question. If you have to take care of 90% of child and house-related duties, while still working, would you consider this a regular part of your duties as a parent/husband? Not for a day, but say a week or a month. Would you not expect some sort of thanks for picking up the lion's share of what is supposed to be a joint responsibility?", "Agree.  People who don't work from home don't realize you're still working (sometimes harder) you just happen to be at home.  What she said when she came home was rude.\n\nPersonally though I can't get past him wanting to be \"thanked\" for parenting his own children.  Does he regularly thank her for that?", "Because both \"mothering\" and \"fathering\" in a house with two parents are a joint responsibility. If one partner suddenly has to do both, this partner should get gratitude.", "But the children were in preschool and/or daycare.  So what are we really talking about here?  He has them for 1 hr in the morning and then for about 3-4 hours after school or daycare until mom gets home.", "If she\u2019s an asshole, so is he. Seriously expecting a thanks for taking care of your own kids is strange behavior. Especially when he can\u2019t even be bothered to clean.", "The kids are in daycare every day 8:30 to 5:30.   She\u2019s probably home by 6:00.   So whose the AH here?   Poor poor husband to have to parent for what?  An hour?   Someone get him a hero cookie!!!  OMG.  The audacity!!   Looking after his own kids for a couple of hours!!  That\u2019s not his job ffs.   Isn\u2019t that why wives were created?   \nOP is NTA.", "Oh grow up!\n\nTaking care of your own children isn't an extra effort. It's a normal responsibility of every person who decided to have a child. He doesn't thank OP for everything she does for their household. \n\nNTA", "Agreed, they are both feeling overwhelmed and aren't acknowledging that they each have to give.  I mean, we've all been there, right?  It will help to talk about it later - maybe after her class is over and everyone isn't so stressed - just for them to each say how they feel about it without accusations.  In the heat of the moment, it's easy to dump on your spouse.", "Eh, that was my initial thought too but I don't think he would have said that if he hadn't been frustrated.  Working from home and childcare of young children doesn't necessarily leave a lot of time for cleaning and can also be exhausting.", "They both have full time occupations, OP goes to school and her husband has a full time job, yet she suddenly gets to relax after work yet her husband has to take care of the kids after work.... ig this is one of those NTA cause women situation because the TLDR if the genders were swapped would be \"AITA for wanting my wife to do the parenting because I want to relax?\"", "You mutually thank each other. I think the issue here is OP doesn't believe her husband would ever thank her for doing childcare or parenting or covering for him. Probably because it's more expected mothers do that, even though our expectation needs to be on both parents.", "That\u2019s a fair question. What I expect is a relationship with mutual respect and gratitude for each other. The scenario presented gives me the impression that this was an unusual situation due to OP\u2019s work schedule. It\u2019s also clear that dad wasn\u2019t tasked with watching the kids all day. I just get the impression that he decided he\u2019d done enough for the day and left a mess for her as a power play. AH move. Respect for her would include cleaning up after the kids \u2014not telling her that she\u2019s responsible for clean up because he already did his part for the day and she should be grateful.", "It's possible he feels he should be thanked. Maybe he thinks it's a favor of some sort, as certain things such as being the \"default parent\" end up falling onto many mothers and men sometimes fail to recognize this and fail to recognize that watching their own kids is just as much their responsibility, and isn't \"babysitting\" or a \"favor\". Very, very possible. \n\nBut I also think he could just feel chronically underappreciated. Clearly a lot of the child care and responsibilities of the home have fallen on him recently. Since he is also the assumingly primary breadwinner (because she is a full time student, and didn't mention paid work but I may be wrong) - he is  taking on the financial burden, most of the caregiving and home responsibility load to help her. This is what relationships are about, and it's not always \"fair\". But coming from the primary breadwinner, \"default parent\", and also end up doing majority of the household work - I would be PISSED if my partner came home to complain about something, thinking I should be doing more. I have never asked or expected to be thanked, but if I felt under appreciated after an especially challenging time - I can see myself perhaps saying it.", "Ok and? He\u2019s working the rest of the day?", "He can't be bothered to clean because she refuses to, they both work full time yet he has to do most the work?", "I think this is a good idea. Also, as you know he\u2019d appreciate it, since he was the one who asked, then you should \u201cdemand\u201d (really, ensure) that he gives that same respect to you. \n\nI think these arguments will become more infrequent this way.", "Because they thought of their point first, and then had to think of a way to explain it.", "I agree with this. But to be expected to be thanked for doing parental duties is a bit much. I doubt OP would be \"thanked\" if the shoe was on the other foot. Expressing frustration and exhaustion is ok, but expecting a thanks like hubby was doing favor isn't.", "Considering work from home he might get two free hours on top, because he doesn't commute or has to prepare for going out to work.", "My bet is there would have not been a thank you for OP after doing all the cleaning.", "To be fair, this is an extreme situation for you both. Both working full time. Both exhausted, and he\u2019s picking up some additional slack for the next 10 days. \n\nI don\u2019t think you need to thank him for taking care of shared children, but if he\u2019s going above and beyond so you can participate in a project, *acknowledgement* might be nice. Like, does he really want thanks or was he responding to being criticized for his performance beneath your expectations?  And no, it\u2019s not your job to clean up everything, but neither is it his. There is still stuff to be done after kids go to bed. Neither of you get to turn off completely after work hours, unless you\u2019re taking turns. \n\nMaybe you BOTH need to practice gratitude and appreciation for each other\u2019s hard work and sacrifices?  Cause it\u2019s gonna be like this a lot when you are out of school and both working demanding jobs with AH clients. So little words of encouragement or thanks throughout the day for you could become a way you also express your love. Like,y husband and I throw out, I love yous all day, and thank you could be the same. It\u2019s just words that make the other feel good.", "I guess I see it that in a healthy relationship, there should be room for thanks/appreciation going both ways.  I don't think there really is inherently anything wrong in wanting appreciation from your spouse for even just taking care of your daily responsibilities.  Unfortunately, there is usually an imbalance of work/inherent misogyny so men demanding a thanks always comes across as playing into that.", "My husband thanks me for being the almost sole parent and house-spouse at the times when he's crazyly busy with work. When we split 50/50 however, nobody expects gratitude. So it really depends on whether you are simply \"playing your part\" or you are taking on more to allow your partner to do something else.", "It may not be about the thank you he might just feel unappreciated", "There's a difference between \"being a parent\" and taking on a larger share of the responsibilities. How often does OP's husband require a 10 day stretch to focus solely on work, leaving the larger share of the parenting duties to OP? \n\nPretty snotty comment about the sticker or gold medal. In a healthy, co-parenting relationship there should be support and expressed appreciation.", "Doesn't mean he can't or doesn't feel that way...", "Couple of things:\n\nFirst you might have different needs with regards to how the house is kept. It is important for you that the house is clean and orderly when you come home, that the house is a haven. He may not share this need. \n\nPresumably you both want the other person to be happy so hopefully you can find a way of managing this that works for both of you.\n\nSecondly he might be less competent than you at tending to the house and the children at the same time. This does not mean you should take on a greater burden. Maybe he can find ways to improve, or strategies to make it easier for him. Maybe not. I don't have a good solution to this except to say that everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Again, however, that doesn't mean you should do more work than he does."]}
