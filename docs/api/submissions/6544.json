You two are both stressed - you with more school and him with more childcare.  This sounds like a fight born out of stress and fatigue with everyone just lashing out. Take a breather and tell him you want to talk about it when you're both feeling calmer. Nobody's really wrong but he needs to realize what stepping up while you're busy means. And sometimes it will be you stepping up when he's busy.  This is how partnership works, not by keeping score but by acting as a team. And sometimes you thank the other person for doing something they should do anyway, just to keep the peace (but honestly I see why you didn't if the house was such a mess). But NTA", "NTA. This sounds like a typical part of being young and raising kids with a partner. Sometimes the workload is lopsided. I'm sure there will come a time when you are doing the lion's share of parenting, will he be thanking you for that?", "NTA. I never understand why some parents think it's an achievement to be alone with their kids. A marriage is a partnership and sometimes you have to pick up the slack to help the other parent. The kids are in daycare / preschool so it's not like he's with them 24/7. You shouldn't have to thank someone for being a baseline parent.", "NTA, he is a parent and an adult. Parenting and cleaning up are his jobs also.", "INFO: does he thank you every time you have the children by yourself?", "I\u2019ve said this before on a different sub. As a father, I am not babysitting my children. I\u2019m their father. I\u2019m raising them. That includes doing housework. Definitely NTA. Your husband needs to join the 21st century.", "NAH really. This is just normal parent bickering. \n\nYou both could be nicer to each other but it\u2019s a stressful time and understandable that tensions ran high. \n\nI don\u2019t know that you have to thank him for taking care of the kids but you could appreciate the fact that he took care of the kids and worked and there wasn\u2019t time to clean the house. He could appreciate how exhausted you are working so much this week. \n\nThe fact is that you both did things that you had to do which left you feeling exhausted at the end of the day.  Nobody goofed off or lazed around. Nobody went and had drinks with buddies. Now you have two exhausted parents and chores needing to be done. It happens. Do what you can without heaping expectations on each other.", "No, I don't think you're an AH for not thanking your husband everytime he's watching the kids himself but you sure do have a lot of expectations. And I get the vibe that you're not very appreciative of what goes on, which makes you an AH\n\nI work remotely often as well, and there should be NO expectation that I am cleaning the house on a break. I rarely take a break, but if I do it's to eat or actually take a moment to myself because after work I have absolutely no alone or downtime once I pick up my son. It's mentally draining. Ever since my partner started working 2nd shift, I am more irritable and more exhausted because I work all day and then am sole caregiver all night. \n\nSometimes it's easier or hard to get things done when kids are around, as I am sure you know. He's probably just as exhausted by working all day, and then being alone with the kids at night. Walking through the door and immediately complaining about things that weren't done is rude af - instead, I'd probably ask \"How was your day?\" And probably assume it was a damn rough one.", "NTA. Would he thank you for mothering? No. Why are you thanking him for fathering?", "ES / NAH?\n\nI'm going to make an assumption that your husband has had a busy day that includes a lot of meetings, if that's the case, from my own experience taking time out for anything at that point will be difficult.  On the other hand, if he had an easy day, then yes he could take some time to sort things out.\n\nAlso just want to point out that this is the 3rd day out of a 10 day marathon, so this is probably a new situation for you.  You really need to talk and figure out what is realistically feasible for both of you.\n\nESH - If you're both sitting around in your own worlds only thinking about what needs to be done individually to satisfy a 50/50 work split.\n\nNAH - If you actually sit down and communicate how you can both help each other make it work.", "NAH. You're both very stressed and division of labor and childcare are even more stressful topics. He wants to be appreciated but you are correct that parenting your children should be a baseline. It's also not unreasonable for him to expect some assistance with housework even though you were working out of the home because he worked in the home while watching the children.\n\nTbh you guys should sit down and discuss needs and expectations for the typical division of labor as well as unusual circumstances like you currently have where one of you may need to temporarily take on more work.", "So, I would say NTA but also your husband is NTA. \nBut I do want to know. You said he works full-time. And I am only asking this because apparently there are different hours for that... How many hours does your husband work? And/or what times? Are his hours flexible? Is he actually working those hours? Or more or less? I don't mean it in any mean way but WFH has very different time/work meanings...\n\n\nAlso, you are a full-time student... How many classes do you take and how many hours is that? Do you have more than once those kind of crazy 10 work-day things or is it a one time thing or sometimes but a different amount of days?\n\nAnd what are the hours for the preschool?\n\nAnd how is you usual?", "NTA, but your husband is also NTA. The truth is that when a situation becomes \u201clopsided\u201d and stressful, the person with the heavy side can get resentful with the weight of it all when you have a partner but they\u2019re just not there. It\u2019s something communication and commiseration for both sides can help ease. You knew This big event was happening, setting expectations on both sides is important, so that there\u2019s a clear understanding and a light at the end of that tunnel.\n\nYou, even with this big event, are still a member of this household. So, while you are exhausted, pitching in to do the dishes (but not everything) is not unreasonable. Just as it is not unreasonable to expect a husband to pitch into the family household he is a part of even if he were to work insane hours outside of the house. \n\nYour husband doesn\u2019t need to be thanked for being the parent he is supposed to be for his kids, but he does need to be acknowledged for taking the extra weight during this stressful time, just as you should be were the situation reversed. \n\nAnd that is the whole point: if the roles were reversed, what would you expect, need, and how would you feel? That is what he needs, and hopefully he would give you the same back (if not, that\u2019s a whole other issue. If he has big events where everything is dumped on you, and he doesn\u2019t help, participate, or appreciate, and you felt this was just turning the tables - that\u2019s a problem that\u2019s just flipped over instead of solved.)", "ESH/NAH. You're both busy and stressed. You obviously have an intense time with job stuff right now. He's picking up some of the slack by doing childcare on his own (outside of the regular childcare hours) on top of his regular job. Should he be doing that for you? Absolutely, marriage is about sacrificing for others and helping them when they're going through a lot as you currently are. But you're coming across as self-centered and ungrateful here. I work from home and it's not a simple matter of taking a few minutes to clean and wash dishes while the kids play. Balancing job and kids and house is exhausting. There are lots of times my hubby comes home to find a messy house because I just couldn't keep up. And his typical response is to thank me for doing everything I do, especially for caring for our children. I get that these are your hubby's kids just as much as they're yours, and maybe he shouldn't be insisting on recognition, but I don't see why you're unwilling to say a simple thanks for the way he's stepping up while you're unable to do what you usually do.", "YTA. \n\nYou're right in that he shouldn't be thanked for being an active parent but you can thank him for the reality that he's been doing the heavy lifting while you're doing this hackathon which will span 10 days. And that's the reality of the situation here, he's doing the bulk of the work with the kiddos while also working full days. \n\nTruth be told, I think you're stressed and can't see the forest through the trees.", "NTA but every time he is \"babysitting\" his own kids give him some pocketmoney.\n\nif he is a little bit smart, he would understand the hint...his own hint", "NAH - you're both stressed, for different reasons, and thanking someone for something they've done, even if it's something \"expected\", is a nice way to combat potentially feeling taken for granted. \nCould you afford for a maid/cleaner a couple of times this week, to take the pressure off you both? Nothing wrong with outsourcing when time is at a premium.", "ESH, but with you being the bigger one. Sorry, he's working from home AND taking care of the kids, AND you want him to clean up the house? Are you insane? This is absolutely crazy.", "NTA he\u2019s a parent, he\u2019s supposed to spend time watching his own kids. Wanting praise for that just speaks to him thinking it\u2019s not \u201chis job\u201d to take care of them, and that\u2019s not okay.", "Everybody sucks.\n\nYou don\u2019t get a free pass at home because YOU chose to go back to school. Having kids and going back to school is an intentional choice and you don\u2019t get to escape your family responsibilities. And he isn\u2019t some hero for spending three hours a night with his own children. You both seem to have bitten off more than you can chew. You either need to learn to share this load better or rethink your enrollment. This is how resentment starts.\n\nIf he is working full time AND taking care of the kids afterwards then you can go to school AND do a load of dishes when you get home. Tbh you both kind of sound entitled. You both chose to have kids and you both seem to want to escape the consequences that come with that choice and live as if you don\u2019t have those responsibilities.", "NTA.\n\nThe only person who is ungrateful and not appreciative enough in all of this is your husband. \n\nHe has ridiculous expectations and needs to become more mature and responsible ASAP.\n\nYou\u2018re doing the best you can, and he\u2018s not the hero he thinks he is.", "ESH. No, you shouldn\u2019t have to thank your husband every time he looks after your children. That\u2019s what parents do. However, he did work all day and look after three small children and you came in and complained about the apartment being messy. Did you take any time to consider that he may have had a very long tiring day as well?", "ESH.\nHe should have talked to you about his \"expectation\" that you help with the cleanup.\n\nBut you don't get a pass - just because he's working from home doesn't mean he can \"take time to wash dishes\". When I am WFH, I am WORKING. I don't just drop off to do other things because I am AT WORK.", "NAH. You've both got very busy lives and it would be good to have a deeper conversation and a better understanding of what he'd take on during busy season in school and what you would take on later on to make up for it\n\nI don't really believe in forced gratitude between life partners but it does look like your husband did take on a lot while you were busy with school and a gesture of gratitude wouldn't hurt since you're unable to do any house work at the moment", "Is school a new endeavor? Seems kinda silly to have kids when you are both not available. 2 and 4 and coming home at 8:30pm? And a dad that works all day. That great for development. \n\nESH you for coming home and complaining instantly and him for thinking he needs to be thanks for taking care of his own kids. What does he need a gold star for doing what\u2019s expected?", "ESH\n\nHim for \"balancing the scales\" out of spite. You for not appreciating him for doing the extra work. \n\nThere's a lot missing from this post as clearly we have no idea what the usual balance is of the household chores and parenting is like, nor do we know how much you both knew this 10 day thing was coming up and how you prepared for it. It sounds like he had a hard day and felt alone in the adulting, it sounds like you had a hard day at work. Apologize for the snark and work together to pick up the house so you can reset for the next crazy day. Work as a team, it's kind of the whole point in being married.", ">I told him (in an admittedly snarky way) that I shouldn\u2019t have to thank him for parenting his own children.\n\nYou forgot the word \"ALONE\" and \"over many days\".  \nYTA. You are ungrateful. Yes, it's his job to care for the kids, but it's yours too, and you fail to be there. The least you can do is be grateful that he allows you to prioritize your career, and accept that you don't get a pass on house chore just because you work.", ">am I the asshole for not always expressing my appreciation for him being with the children we made together?\n\nHave you ever thanked him for the extra work he does to accommodate your busy schedule?\n\nIt doesn't seem like the issue is really \"you haven't thanked me enough\" so much as \"It doesn't feel like you appreciate the *extra* work that I do\"\n\nIt sounds like you husband might have been tired as well, but when you came home you essentially said \"The work you've been doing isn't good enough\" which can be frustrating since he is already doing more work than normal to accommodate you.\n\n~~Y T A~~ NAH. You were both busy. Communication, however, could be improved.\n\n~~I would revise my assessment, however, if you usually do more housework/childcare during times when your schedules are normal. Does it seem like he is slacking off the rest of the time, or does it just seem like he isn't picking up enough slack when you are busy?~~", "YTA. If this had been written by a man it would be raining YTAS.\n\nworking from home does not Mean he isnt working, and you having a demanding crunch does not mean he has to pick up the slack id you haven't talked about it.", "NTA.  Your husband is lazy.  He's not doing his share.  Watching the kids is part of his responsibility.  You don't get rewarded for doing that.  You're gonna have to train him better.", "NTA. Yes things can be stressful when things get lopsided but it sounds like the expectation for you to clean was never communicated or negotiated and it's day 3 of 10. It's lopsided but you're also contributing and there is a very short end date. Maybe you two can communicate expectations better but honestly, pulling extra for ten days when need arises doesn't need giant cookies.", "ESH. Thank each other every time. Appreciate each other.", "YTA.\nHe's not asking for a thank you for performing his typical duties within the household. He's asking for a thank you for going above and beyond those typical duties to accommodate something YOU want to do. Absolutely he deserves some recognition for the extra effort he is putting into your household for your benefit.\n\nAt the very least this is not something you should be fighting over. Thank him and move on.", "NAH... Or ESH depending on your pov.\n\nYou're tired, he's tired, these situations are gonna come up when you both decide full time endeavours that eat up so much of your time. This is the reality of parenting so you and your husband better buckle in because you've got another 15+yrs at least of it until they up and leave the nest.\n\nHe worked all day, you were at college/ Uni all day. I assume you left out the part where you expressed disappointment to your husband after coming home to a bit of a mess (because I don't see how else this whole argument started). Just as much as I'm sure you wouldn't be particularly very happy if he came home and complained about the state of the house after you'd worked all day, I'm sure he wasn't either. From what you yourself laid out, he's picking up some of your slack for not being there. So at the end of your intense project, yeah a simple thank you would go a long way. That doesn't mean you have to thank him every day, he's a parent as well and if he didn't want the responsibility he shouldn't have had kids, but the last thing he needs is you coming home and questioning the manner in which he's carrying your end of the couch for this period of time.\n\nYou both need to learn to communicate better, fighting each other instead of working together is the kindling of divorce.\n\nINFO: how old are you both?", "YTA working remotely and getting\"home all day\" doesn't mean he has the time to do a bunch of dishes. You admit yourself that you've been absent for the last week and he has gone above and beyond with the childcare. Like yes, that's partly his responsibility but you could show some appreciation for the fact that he's doing more than his fair share right now and not berate him for things falling a bit behind.\n\nIf the roles were reversed would you want some extra gratitude?", "ESH\n\nHe\u2019s picking up extra slack. He\u2019s not used to having them alone, organizing dinner, and cleaning\u2014he\u2019s just trying to keep the kids alive and survive after his full day of work to support your career path. Seems to me that a thank you would be reasonable.\n\nBut then I\u2019m the kind of person who thanks my partner and my step son a lot. If partner pays for dinner, I think him. He makes dinner, I thank him. He takes out the garbage, swaps the sheets, walks the dog, gets me a glass of water\u2026.I thank him. With the exception of getting me a glass of water, these are all things that are both of our \u201cjobs\u201d but I\u2019ve found that things are much more balanced when I acknowledge and thank effort. \n\nAnd when I have to work late\u2014unplanned\u2014and he picks up something extra that I had planned\u2014like making dinner\u2014I give extra thanks. Because he really is making it possible for me to do my job by picking up some slack when I can\u2019t be available. \n\nLastly, I work from home and I realize that WFH varies by job. But when I\u2019m working, I\u2019m WORKING. I\u2019m usually in meetings or preparing for meetings. I *might* have time to swap laundry from the washer to the dryer but that\u2019s about it. I can\u2019t be away from my computer long enough to wash some dishes or vacuum or whatever. Any cleaning I want to do has to be done when I\u2019m not working. So it gets old to me to hear \u201cthey work from home, they could do X\u201d\u2026no. Not if you actually have a job to do.", "NAH, looking after 2 young kids alone is stressful, especially when they are grumpy and impossible to please. Many people will snap at their partner in that situation; which is a lot better than snapping at the kids I can assure you\n\nJust need some communication\u2026 appreciate your situation is difficult but the occasional text to check in on hubby to see how the kids are is likely to help him feel a smidge better and it would keep you connected to home", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Normally our son is in childcare, but this week we realised fairly late that this is closed due to the holidays. As a result, I've had to watch our son while I work, which is a fairly challenging thing to do as he's an emotional toddler who wants a lot of attention. I am also expecting our second baby, so my energy levels in general have taken a bit of a hit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving my son over the last few days and having to balance this with work has been exhausting. I haven't been able to get much work done and although I've had a quick tidy up, I am absolutely exhausted. If my husband came home today and started making comments about what I hadn't done, I would probably be very frustrated too. Your husband may work from home but he's taking on additional responsibility by caring for your children alongside this. They're his children too of course, but he has an additional responsibility to his employer and probably has tasks to complete at work, so it isn't realistic to expect him to do everything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're under a lot of pressure at work and I totally appreciate that you don't want to get home and fix the mess that they have all created, but it's all about doing what you can. I am sure your husband doesn't expect you to clear the apartment from top to bottom but it may have been useful for you to do a smaller job such as take the trash out or do the dishes. If your husband if anything like me, he'll be overtly aware that there are household jobs outstanding, and you picking up on them the moment you walk through the door isn't helping anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes I get annoyed at my husband because I feel he doesn't recognise what I do for our family, but I know that realistically I am just as guilty of this. It can be hard looking at the bigger picture when you're trying to balance daily responsibilities, your career, family, etc, but it really does help to take a step back and remember that your partner is a human being and will be dealing with the same stressors that you are.

Yes, the place is a mess and I can understand how getting home to that can suck. But at the same time, expecting him to perfectly handle the entire load of the household for the duration of the hackathon deserves some leniency and understanding. His expectation that she'll clean up in gratitude is also out of line. They ought to tackle it together or or work out how to handle it in times like these.", "Yes! It's not 50/50 - It's 100/100. And everyone wants to be recognized for their efforts - which sometimes feels ridiculous. I thank show appreciation to my partner any time he does just about anything.

Well said!", "Being young and raising kids *and* your partner.\n\nWittle Hubby wants his gold star for doing the absolute bare minimum. *Slow clap* Don't humor your husband, OP.

I picked up a large portion of the childcare, cooking, cleaning, so they could come home and not have to worry. They were very appreciative of my effort and said so, and I appreciated that they voiced their appreciation. Small gestures like that can go a long way.\n\nI told them parenting to me, is like american football. Some weeks the team is running and throwing the ball well and it ends up being 50/50 run/pass. Some weeks the team can't run the ball and relies heavily on the pass game that week, and others, the passing game is trash and the team has to run the ball more. At the end of the day, the goal is to win (successful parenting), and just may require one side to carry load more than the other but at the end, it all comes out in a wash as long as the ultimate goal of taking care of kids and the house is done. \n\nOP and husband are both stressed, and tired, NAH.", "This should be the top comment.", "Exactly. Spot on.", "> thank him for taking care of the kids \n\nI wouldn't call that \"normal\" parent bickering.  At least I hope it isn't.  OP is right, he shouldn't be thanked for parenting his own children.\n\nAgree with everything else you said though.", "This isn\u2019t exactly applicable to this situation but I do thank my partner when they are able to cover for me. She does the same. I think expressing gratitude to your partner is good for the relationship.\n\nI think people on this sub have a black and white mentality that leads to statements like, \u201c You shouldn't have to thank someone for being a baseline parent\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s true that you shouldn\u2019t have to but wouldn\u2019t it be nice if you did?", "Ofc not, it\u2019s \u201cher job\u201d", "Ok, genuine question. If you have to take care of 90% of child and house-related duties, while still working, would you consider this a regular part of your duties as a parent/husband? Not for a day, but say a week or a month. Would you not expect some sort of thanks for picking up the lion's share of what is supposed to be a joint responsibility?", "Agree.  People who don't work from home don't realize you're still working (sometimes harder) you just happen to be at home.  What she said when she came home was rude.\n\nPersonally though I can't get past him wanting to be \"thanked\" for parenting his own children.  Does he regularly thank her for that?", "Because both \"mothering\" and \"fathering\" in a house with two parents are a joint responsibility. If one partner suddenly has to do both, this partner should get gratitude.", "But the children were in preschool and/or daycare.  So what are we really talking about here?  He has them for 1 hr in the morning and then for about 3-4 hours after school or daycare until mom gets home.", "If she\u2019s an asshole, so is he.

She\u2019s probably home by 6:00.   So whose the AH here?   Poor poor husband to have to parent for what?  An hour?   Someone get him a hero cookie!!!  OMG.  The audacity!!   Looking after his own kids for a couple of hours!!  That\u2019s not his job ffs.   Isn\u2019t that why wives were created?   \nOP is NTA.", "Oh grow up!\n\nTaking care of your own children isn't an extra effort. It's a normal responsibility of every person who decided to have a child. He doesn't thank OP for everything she does for their household. \n\nNTA", "Agreed, they are both feeling overwhelmed and aren't acknowledging that they each have to give.  I mean, we've all been there, right?  It will help to talk about it later - maybe after her class is over and everyone isn't so stressed - just for them to each say how they feel about it without accusations.  In the heat of the moment, it's easy to dump on your spouse.", "Eh, that was my initial thought too but I don't think he would have said that if he hadn't been frustrated.  Working from home and childcare of young children doesn't necessarily leave a lot of time for cleaning and can also be exhausting.", "They both have full time occupations, OP goes to school and her husband has a full time job, yet she suddenly gets to relax after work yet her husband has to take care of the kids after work.... ig this is one of those NTA cause women situation because the TLDR if the genders were swapped would be \"AITA for wanting my wife to do the parenting because I want to relax?\"", "You mutually thank each other. I think the issue here is OP doesn't believe her husband would ever thank her for doing childcare or parenting or covering for him. Probably because it's more expected mothers do that, even though our expectation needs to be on both parents.", "That\u2019s a fair question. What I expect is a relationship with mutual respect and gratitude for each other. The scenario presented gives me the impression that this was an unusual situation due to OP\u2019s work schedule. It\u2019s also clear that dad wasn\u2019t tasked with watching the kids all day. I just get the impression that he decided he\u2019d done enough for the day and left a mess for her as a power play. AH move. Respect for her would include cleaning up after the kids \u2014not telling her that she\u2019s responsible for clean up because he already did his part for the day and she should be grateful.", "It's possible he feels he should be thanked. Maybe he thinks it's a favor of some sort, as certain things such as being the \"default parent\" end up falling onto many mothers and men sometimes fail to recognize this and fail to recognize that watching their own kids is just as much their responsibility, and isn't \"babysitting\" or a \"favor\". Very, very possible. \n\nBut I also think he could just feel chronically underappreciated. Clearly a lot of the child care and responsibilities of the home have fallen on him recently. Since he is also the assumingly primary breadwinner (because she is a full time student, and didn't mention paid work but I may be wrong) - he is  taking on the financial burden, most of the caregiving and home responsibility load to help her. This is what relationships are about, and it's not always \"fair\". But coming from the primary breadwinner, \"default parent\", and also end up doing majority of the household work - I would be PISSED if my partner came home to complain about something, thinking I should be doing more. I have never asked or expected to be thanked, but if I felt under appreciated after an especially challenging time - I can see myself perhaps saying it.\n\nEdit to add: For example, my partner decided to leave a well paying job because it changed from 7-8 hour days and 40 hour weeks, to 9-11 hour days with travel and 50+ hour weeks and no end in sight. He found a low stress job, with a 2nd shift schedule and it came with a SIGNIFICANT pay cut. I was already making more than him, and this change meant even more responsibility was on me and has affected our lifestyle for sure. Not only financially, but he is not around after my work day to help with our son so more of the caregiving and parenting is on me. I have no breaks now. He is happier now, but this required some sacrifices on my end and has resulted in more stress for me. If he came home after work and complained that the house was a mess and expected me to do more, I'd feel underappreciated and irrate that despite me doing significantly more than him, making sacrifices for HIS happiness - there's no thank you? I don't need a thank you to watch my kids, or paying and managing the bills- but saying so would be more of a statement like \"you ungrateful AH\".", "Ok and? He\u2019s working the rest of the day?", "He can't be bothered to clean because she refuses to, they both work full time yet he has to do most the work?", "I think this is a good idea. Also, as you know he\u2019d appreciate it, since he was the one who asked, then you should \u201cdemand\u201d (really, ensure) that he gives that same respect to you. \n\nI think these arguments will become more infrequent this way.", "Because they thought of their point first, and then had to think of a way to explain it.", "I agree with this. But to be expected to be thanked for doing parental duties is a bit much. I doubt OP would be \"thanked\" if the shoe was on the other foot. Expressing frustration and exhaustion is ok, but expecting a thanks like hubby was doing favor isn't.", "Considering work from home he might get two free hours on top, because he doesn't commute or has to prepare for going out to work.", "My bet is there would have not been a thank you for OP after doing all the cleaning.", "To be fair, this is an extreme situation for you both. Both working full time. Both exhausted, and he\u2019s picking up some additional slack for the next 10 days. \n\nI don\u2019t think you need to thank him for taking care of shared children, but if he\u2019s going above and beyond so you can participate in a project, *acknowledgement* might be nice. Like, does he really want thanks or was he responding to being criticized for his performance beneath your expectations?  And no, it\u2019s not your job to clean up everything, but neither is it his. There is still stuff to be done after kids go to bed. Neither of you get to turn off completely after work hours, unless you\u2019re taking turns. \n\nMaybe you BOTH need to practice gratitude and appreciation for each other\u2019s hard work and sacrifices?  Cause it\u2019s gonna be like this a lot when you are out of school and both working demanding jobs with AH clients. So little words of encouragement or thanks throughout the day for you could become a way you also express your love. Like,y husband and I throw out, I love yous all day, and thank you could be the same. It\u2019s just words that make the other feel good.", "I guess I see it that in a healthy relationship, there should be room for thanks/appreciation going both ways.  I don't think there really is inherently anything wrong in wanting appreciation from your spouse for even just taking care of your daily responsibilities.  Unfortunately, there is usually an imbalance of work/inherent misogyny so men demanding a thanks always comes across as playing into that.", "My husband thanks me for being the almost sole parent and house-spouse at the times when he's crazyly busy with work. When we split 50/50 however, nobody expects gratitude. So it really depends on whether you are simply \"playing your part\" or you are taking on more to allow your partner to do something else.", "It may not be about the thank you he might just feel unappreciated", "There's a difference between \"being a parent\" and taking on a larger share of the responsibilities. How often does OP's husband require a 10 day stretch to focus solely on work, leaving the larger share of the parenting duties to OP? \n\nPretty snotty comment about the sticker or gold medal. In a healthy, co-parenting relationship there should be support and expressed appreciation.", "Doesn't mean he can't or doesn't feel that way...", "Couple of things:\n\nFirst you might have different needs with regards to how the house is kept. It is important for you that the house is clean and orderly when you come home, that the house is a haven. He may not share this need. \n\nPresumably you both want the other person to be happy so hopefully you can find a way of managing this that works for both of you.\n\nSecondly he might be less competent than you at tending to the house and the children at the same time. This does not mean you should take on a greater burden. Maybe he can find ways to improve, or strategies to make it easier for him. Maybe not. I don't have a good solution to this except to say that everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Again, however, that doesn't mean you should do more work than he does.", "YTA. your husband expressed how he was feeling and instead of reassuring him and thanking him you say things like, he could've at least washed the dishes... you're gaslighting him.  If a woman made this post about a man it would have completely different responses. Taking care of the kids, working and cleaning the house are 3 things while you're doing 1 but yet bitching about HIM not doing enough?", "There's more going on here with the cleaning, and lots have addressed that. I'm just going to comment on appreciation.\n\nWith our chosen domestic distribution, my husband cooks 80% of our dinners. It's his \"job.\" I thank him every time. I am a stay at home mom, it literally is my job so I do 95% of night care and am the default day parent. He helps me get showers and stuff during the day and spends more time with her during the evening. He frequently tells me, \"thank you for taking care of our daughter,\" even though it is my job. People on Reddit get up in arms when parents (especially dads) like to be thanked for caring for their own kids. But I just don't get that attitude.\n\nYou can, and should, appreciate someone for doing what they are \"supposed to do.\" Appreciation is free. When our daughter has given me a hell of a day, a simple \"thank you\" can turn my whole day around. What's the harm?", "NTA. OK you\u2019re not the asshole for telling him you don\u2019t have to thank him for parenting his kids. But you are the asshole for assuming someone that\u2019s working from home can stop whenever they want to clean up and do dishes. When we work from home we\u2019re working from home. It does not mean we can take breaks whenever the hell we want to to do stuff at home. I\u2019m tired of that attitude about those of us that work from home that we can stop anytime we want and do anything that we want to do.", "I\u2019m conflicted between ESH and NAH. \n\nThis fight stems from frustration, stress, fatigue and overwhelm. There\u2019s very good points to be made about both sides.\n\nHonestly, if he\u2019s home all day with the kids he should be at the very minimum doing the dishes clean up after the meals. It\u2019s unfair to leave a full day of cleaning up to the wife especially after knowing she\u2019s had a very laborious exhausting work day. It\u2019s his home and his children and it\u2019s as much his responsibility to clean the home and take care of the kids as it is hers. I\u2019d be upset as well walking into a trashed house and my husband expecting me to clean it at 8:30 or later at night.  He should have cleaned. \n\nHowever, there\u2019s also the added fact that he was also working a full day at home aside from child care. He may not have had time to clean either. So it might just be a lack of communication and poor judgment on his part to assume that she would clean when she got home as part of the deal. \n\nBut what this really boils down to is miscommunication, feeling stressed, overwhelmed and frustrated by the situation and trying to manage and navigate new territory. There needs to be better communication and a plan in place with set roles for each other. Clearly defined. And adhered to on both sides. \n\nAs far as the thanking him for childcare. Yes. Thank your husband for being willing to be an active father and a supportive husband. Thank him for being willing to work with you during the difficult time of your career. It\u2019s not about thanking him for doing his job as a parent. It\u2019s thanking him for his willingness to do it for his family. There is a huge difference. Just because it\u2019s his responsibility, doesn\u2019t mean he wants to do it. I mean come on, who really ever wants to take out the trash or do the dishes or scrub a toilet? No one. We\u2019d all rather not, but it\u2019s our responsibility to do it, so we do. It\u2019s a choice to be willingly and actively involved in your lives. Just as it\u2019s your choice OP. And he should be thanking you for your commitment to the family as well. \n\nThere\u2019s not any reason why you can\u2019t be grateful and thank him for being home with the kids, even if it is his responsibility because right now, you have put extra stress and workload on him while your schedule has changed. Common courtesy, respect,and gratitude are never inappropriate.", "I love how people try to downplay people's jobs by stating they either work from home or it's remote. \n\nHe works full time (remote) lol.

The other days of the week, we work together to care for our kids/home.   \nWhen my husband works late, I have \\*NEVER\\* had the expectation that he would come home and finish the clean up because i had handled the parenting without him and he owed me clean up. I just suck it up and do all the clean up by myself that day, even though i'm tired from parenting alone.  So THE husband is an A H for assuming with no discussion that OP'd clean up.   \nBut OP assuming he can clean the house while he's supposed to be working isn't fair either. He is supposed to do his job during the day. If he can fit in dishes, cool. But there are some days when you are too busy for that, even though you're working from home.   \nAnd while Dads shouldn't be thanked for stepping up as a parent in a general sense, when you are used to handling things together and one of you suddenly is handling it all solo, it's nice to be thanked.

Husband needs to recognize that OP will be tired, cranky and overwhelmed at the end of the day. OP need to recognize the same for him. Their house is going to be a disaster. It's okay. They're going to eat an entire meal off paper plates because no one has the energy for dishes. It's okay.  \nThe hardest thing about having a spouse who is working too much to help is that you're stuck doing all the work of a single parent AND you're being held to someone else's expectations of home care.

This is that whole \u201cif the roles were reversed\u201d thing and we know a man would get DRAGGED for that suggestion", "There have been many times when my partner was on a deadline where I basically took over 100% with the kids for multiple days and yes, hearing that it was appreciated goes a long way. And while I may not have \u201cexpected\u201d a thank you, if I\u2019m criticized for not keeping the place tidy when we\u2019re all just trying to survive, it\u2019s reasonable to think, \u201cwell you\u2019re not even appreciative of the extra effort I\u2019m putting out acknowledging what it takes out of me to do this, and you\u2019re over here criticizing\u201d?", "Exactly. I grew up in the 60s & Dad left for work long before my siblings & I got up in the morning. Mom worked too, so we stayed with an aunt & uncle before & after school & they fed us & made sure our homework got done. Dad stayed awake for a litle while after we got home from our aunt & uncle's but went to bed early so he could get up early. The few times Mom was sick, he called his boss & said he would be late so he could get us ready for school. However, we spent most of the weekends with him, even if it was just going to the local tavern (kids were allowed in bars with an adult back then) to watch the ball game in color. He would take us fishing or just sit outside watching us as we played football in the street to make sure we didn't kill each other when we were on opposite teams. Sometimes Mom would pack a picinc lunch & Dad would load us in the car & we'd spend Saturday at the beach or he would surprise us with box seat tickets to the ball game. He never, ever asked to be thanked for spending time with his children.", "He had them for three hours, 5:30 to 8:30. They were in school/daycare the rest of the day.", "No, they both are doing more because OP does more child work now, she literally admits he does more child work than her", "Fair point. My wife stayed home with 2 small children while I went to work full-time and law school at night. Never once did I come home to her demands that I now have to clean up. Mutual respect. Mutual appreciation. I understand her frustration. I don\u2019t understand his arrogance and insensitivity.", "Have the kids been in daycare/preschool during this week also? Like is he only caring for them in the evenings for these two weeks or all day? Because if it\u2019s just a few hours in the evening I\u2019d honestly say NTA because I\u2019m guessing you most likely do a lot of it when your not working crazy hours.", "Because her tasks are hers, and his tasks are his, just like in any couple where you split tasks", "Yeah, I missed the flair. Shoulda checked first.", "It also helps to recognize when appreciation and thankfulness is a need on behalf of your partner.  My husband's love language is words of appreciation, and he feels love through this method.  An extra effort to express love this way has worked wonders in our 20+ year marriage.", "We fought about appreciation/chores a lot when our kids were little. He\u2019d do half a chore and want thanks. I\u2019d say, how can I thank you for doing what you were supposed to do\u2014especially when you only did half the job?!\n\nNow that we\u2019re out of the intense little-kids stage, it\u2019s easier in some ways (harder in others). It\u2019s much easier for me to thank my partner for doing little/ordinary/expected things when I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m drowning. \n\nFor example, I leave tomorrow for a two-week business trip. I\u2019ll thank my spouse for handling all the parenting while I\u2019m gone. Of course he will do it. He\u2019s their dad! But I will still say thank you, because I do appreciate not having to worry about the house/kids when I\u2019m traveling for work. And it means a lot to him to be thanked, so I show him that appreciation. Which will probably come with chocolate and a back rub after my return, as I know my spouse.", "Yeah, I don't like this attitude of not thanking a partner because what they do is expected. I also don't see why a \"wow I'm tired, I'm so glad I have you as my partner so I can do things like this, thanks babe\". Is so hard for some people. My husband always does laundry and dishes. If there's an extra big pile of laundry (like after vacation) I thank him, if only for the fact that I don't have to do it. If I do the dishes for a change, he thanks me because he didn't have to. I get there are relationships where one partner demands thanks for changing the toilet paper, but that's not what I think this was. This was two people utterly exhausted who forgot that they were both in need of some TLC.", "I do this, too, but my husband also doesn\u2019t stomp around acting like a martyr who deserves a gold medal for washing the dishes. I regularly thank him, *he regularly thanks me*, and it works because neither of us act like the other person should be kissing our feet for doing our share, and the appreciation runs *both* ways.", "Sure, I thank my partner when they do something that warrants it. But I'm not thanking someone that whines about not getting a thank you for watching their own children for three hours solo.", "Then I don't see why he couldn't have done the breakfast dishes and take the trash out, honestly.", "I understand that as the sole income and currently virtually single parent he's frustrated that him picking up the slack is being met with disdain over a messy house. If he can do all that stuff, it isn't unreasonable to expect some help with cleanup.", "If someone yells at me while I'm hustling to support them, and taking on extra duties, I'm not going to be super happy.  It looks like this stems from her jumping him when she got home.", "He's been doing literally everything for the household during this period. He lashed out a little, but he's basically a single parent during this stretch and is likely burning out without support from OP.", ">I\u2019ve tried to help with child care as much as I can (e.g., dropping the kids off, helping to get them ready for the next day\n\n\nYep - that's in the post, but it's within a big paragraph so easy to miss.", "This is true, but this particular case doesn't sound like a \"love language\" misunderstanding. It sounds like he wants a gold star for doing the bare minimum of keeping the kids alive until OP could get home & take care of everything else- late into the night after a very intense work day no less.", "The very first job I ever had at a fast food restaurant my boss taught us you should always ask not tell people to do things and then say thank you when they agree and great job when they are done. Why wouldn\u2019t I at LEAST treat my spouse as well as I was treated when I was sweeping floors and making tacos? It takes zero effort to show appreciation and makes things go more smoothly. Particularly if your spouse is telling you this is how they want to be treated why not just do it? Weird hill to die on man.", "But he didnt take care of the daily responsibilities. He took care of the kids well being, but intentionally didnt lift a finger to take care of any cleaning, and then used the fact that he had to play dad on his own for a few hours as a reason to essentially punish OP... all while expecting praise! Hes an AH.\n\nWhen I come home and things are clean up/dishes are done, I'm always like \"house looks great, I appreciate you putting in that effort!\". If I come and the house is a mess and I know they've been home all day, no way am I saying 'omg thanks for doing the bare minimum of keeping the kids alive\" while I get to cleaning.", "I thank my wife every time I have to travel, and she picks up the slack with me gone. She's a SAHM and I've managed to allow her to do that for nearly 13 years, and she's been willing to be single parent at times while I've grown our business and hustled. I still try to help clean, and get up with the kids and dogs to give her breaks. She thanks me for the things I do. A little gratitude prevents a lot of resentment.", "Yes I agree - I don\u2019t thank my partner for being a parent but I do thank them for picking up my slack.", "It\u2019s only been 3 days! And he\u2019s only alone with the kids for 3 hours a day. He\u2019s not doing \u201cliterally everything for the household\u201d \u2014 he\u2019s just caring for his own children for 3 hours until she comes home. For a few days. Not cool for him to lash out.", "Helping isn't coming in and jumping him because the house wasn't taken care of to her expectations.", "My EX used to refer to this as \"babysitting.\" Like no...you are not *babysitting* your own kids, you are parenting. He's an EX for a reason.", "Lmao I'm guessing with preschool aged kids those 3 hours are everything. Can't imagine the kids being up at 9 or so when OP gets home. So after his shift that's just about as long as her schooling, he does all the childcare and is apparently expected to do all of the housework without his wife's support. He's just looking for some gratitude. He is the sole provider, doing the Lions share of the child rearing and doing the housework. Maybe not \"literally\" everything, but it sounds like the vast majority.\n\nI guarantee a \"I appreciate you picking up the slack during this time\" is all it would take to smooth out everything"]}
