Let me spare the poor parents the pain of knowing that they missed their child's first steps. You had no right to decided that. Most parents want to know what is happening with their children especially when it pertains to their child's development. I understand why your sister feels you broke her trust. You made a unilaterial decision to keep information from her about something pertaining to her child. Your actions would make me think I couldn't trust you to tell me what is going on with my child if you don't deem it important enough for me to know. It's like people who tell little white lies to spare people's feelings. The moment you get caught in a little no matter how small your trust is broken with that person because they now have confirmation that you will lie to them.

That's one thing I remember standing out from my infant/toddler class, because I said as a parent it wouldn't bother me if a teacher told me my baby did something for the first time because it would be my first time seeing it.
