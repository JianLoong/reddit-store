Your sister is just lashing out because she\u2019s upset she missed the first steps. Give her time", "Yes you were wrong and your reasoning is condescending. Let me spare the poor parents the pain of knowing that they missed their child's first steps. You had no right to decided that. Most parents want to know what is happening with their children especially when it pertains to their child's development. I understand why your sister feels you broke her trust. You made a unilaterial decision to keep information from her about something pertaining to her child. Your actions would make me think I couldn't trust you to tell me what is going on with my child if you don't deem it important enough for me to know. It's like people who tell little white lies to spare people's feelings. The moment you get caught in a little no matter how small your trust is broken with that person because they now have confirmation that you will lie to them.

That was one of the first things I was taught when I worked with children. I had a coworker who didn\u2019t follow this rule and the mother crying was so heartbreaking.", "Seconded (thirded?). That's one thing I remember standing out from my infant/toddler class, because I said as a parent it wouldn't bother me if a teacher told me my baby did something for the first time because it would be my first time seeing it. But I totally get why some parents would be bummed out. I'll usually wait until a parent mentions they've done said milestone at home before mentioning it to them.", "I\u2019m a childcare worker but I only learned this from reddit!", "For the same reason the neighbor was watching OP and the baby through the window: because they\u2019re nosey", "\u2026\u2026", "How come I can't see the rest of this story?", "NTA.

As a childcare worker with 15 years experience, I've learned the important thing to the parents is when they themselves experienced those firsts. I never told the parents when a baby walked for me, or did anything else for the first time. Most parents want to be the ones to witness it.\n\nYou where not being malicious and it's not your fault you and a nieghbors where the ones who saw her first steps. Your sister needs a few days to cool down. Shes at least lucky enough to get the event on camera. that is a prescious video that many parents don't have.", "I don't know. I'm only speaking from my perspective, but I would definitely want to know if my baby took his first steps, even if I wasn't there. Yeah, I'd be disappointed, but I'd still want to know. And hope that whoever witnessed it took a video of it! But I see no AHs here.", "NTA. Hopefully your sister will come around when she has time to cool off and really think about things.", "NAH.

Sheesh!", "Exactly. Our providers never told us if our child did anything and let us have our \u201cfirsts\u201d with him. That meant the world to us because we both had to work and it was killing us to have him in daycare.", "Came to say this as well! I worked in childcare for years, mostly with infants, and we NEVER told parents about milestones (crawling, walking, talking). We always waited for them to tell us about those important firsts.\n\nEdit: NTA for OP", "NTA can confirm. I saw a LOT of firsts and no one ever knew.", "You are wrong on so many levels it's not worth arguing but at least you're getting downvoted as such a poor response deserves.", "NTA\n\nTell your sister she needs to tell your A+H neighbor to mind her own business.", "NTA you wanted them to experience a special moment there\u2019s nothing wrong with that", "NTA She didn't miss out. She saw it on the security camera.  Maybe she needs to keep her daughter with her 24/7 so she doesn't miss out on any others.", "NTA. She is being petty. Your intentions were genuinely good. Let her go suck on a lemon.", "NTA. Your sister feels guilty that she wasn\u2019t the one to experience her daughter\u2019s first steps because of an appointment. That\u2019s normal, especially for first babies. Eventually, sis will realize this isn\u2019t something worth getting so upset over. It\u2019s kind of you to give her grace to be irrational and she definitely owes you an apology for her reaction.", "NTA - this is a common technique with child care professionals.  It does no harm, while preserving a \"first\" experience for the parent.  In my experience the only exceptions are when a child is delayed in meeting a milestone.\n\nYou sister is upset she missed it and is taking it out on you.  Stay calm, don't take it personally and hopefully her husband can bring her around soon.", "NTA\nWhat you\u2019re doing is sweet", "Yup. The only first we will tell parents about is rolling over on their own, because it is a safety concern and changes how we can swaddle and such. Sometimes I'll try to hint and be like \"hey keep a close eye out, I think Emily is getting ready to walk soon\" and then the next day mom is so excited to tell me that Emily took her first steps last night. Mom doesn't need to know that Emily has been toddling around the room the last two days.", "My son took his first steps - or at least the first steps I saw - in front of both me and our daycare provider. She fucking SOLD it and should probably get an honorary Oscar if it was fake. And for that I am forever grateful, because it means I got to see my son\u2019s first steps.", "I can attest to this. Missed my kids first words and birthday due to issues. It broke my heart and still does thinking about the fact that I couldn't be there for those moments.", "This is what we were taught to do, too.  Tell the parents \u201cooh, keep an eye out.  I think little Tammy is close to crawling/walking/pulling herself up/ (which ever milestone)!\u201d  That way the parents know to watch for it themselves at home, and don\u2019t know that their kid may have already done it at daycare\u2026"]}
