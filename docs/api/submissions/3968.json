Let me spare the poor parents the pain of knowing that they missed their child's first steps. You had no right to decided that. Most parents want to know what is happening with their children especially when it pertains to their child's development. I understand why your sister feels you broke her trust. You made a unilaterial decision to keep information from her about something pertaining to her child. Your actions would make me think I couldn't trust you to tell me what is going on with my child if you don't deem it important enough for me to know.

That's one thing I remember standing out from my infant/toddler class, because I said as a parent it wouldn't bother me if a teacher told me my baby did something for the first time because it would be my first time seeing it.

Of course, I hugged him and told him what a wonderful child he was and encouraged him to do it again.

Since I had a lot of time with our daughter, I got to see a lot of those \"firsts\" that he didn't get to see. I had comforted her when she got fussy and wiped away a tiny tear. I didn't tell husband. Later that night when he was holding her to calm her, she shed a few tears. He was so sweet! \"OMG! Your first tears. Awwww.
