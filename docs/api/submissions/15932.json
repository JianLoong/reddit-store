Chances are she did a lot of those things not because she wanted to, but because she was told by her parents that those were the things she needed to do to get into a good school, so even if you're right that they aren't exceptional, you saying that probably struck a nerve. She probably feels like she's disappointed everyone around her and that she's a failure.\n\nYou also said she got rejected by \"most\" of the top 20 schools, did she get into one?

There was another student who was top 10 in the class GPA wise, perfect SAT bas and subject scores, 35 ACT, was in the same academic extracurriculars as us (and was much more competitive) and others (He was on the International Math Olympiad team), learned calculus in middle school and he didn't get in to MIT. He still went to Cal Tech so its not such a sad story but I bet you can already guess what races each of us are. \n\nTLDR:A black guy got into MIT with an application that would have got a white guy into a state school while an asian guy who was definitely a way better candidate than both didn't get in.", "No it doesn\u2019t mean for sure that your accomplishments were enough without it - they might have been but you don\u2019t actually know that.

I am actually supportive of that, but it\u2019s a bit much for you to act like there\u2019s no effect on your chances from it.  I\u2019m happy you got into the schools you wanted, but I\u2019d have a little more compassion for your cousin.", "Oh yes, I wholeheartedly agree that that perception is a huge issue and obviously the cousin was being an AH there, thats why my judgement was ESH. Racism affects different groups in different ways though and not acknowledging one groups plights because its inconvenient to your argument is AH behavior.", "Agree. Should be ESH. You both made assumptions. Same judgement. But also think you're less AH than your cousin. You didn't say she had no accomplishments but that they were average. Pedestrian. She basically said your accomplishments didn't matter because you had an ace up your sleeve.

I don't think you need to stand up to family.*\n\n\n*monsters exluded.", "Where?", "Quality/narrative of the writing sample/personal statement matters too, and you have no way of knowing that factor.", "The issue with that is this had been going on for months and I wanted to stop", "Hmm, fair", "While she might not say these things to your face anymore, she\u2019ll likely continue behind your back and multiple family members now think you\u2019re an AH.\n\nIf the latter bothers you less than her direct comments then mission accomplished."]}
