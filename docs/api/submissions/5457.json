My car was in the shop & she came to pick me up from work & on our way back she decides to stop at a gas station. \nWe pull up to the machine, she looks at me funny for a moment, doesn't say anything & then gets out the car & starts pumping her gas. When she gets back in the car, I ask her what the funny look was for & she says, \"Really? How do I have a man in the car & I'm the one pumping gas?\"\n\n\"Because its your car & youre the one driving?\"\n\nShe says, \"Wow. And you're not even a little bit embarassed? Watching your girlfriend pump gas in the cold while youre sitting in the nice, warm car listening to music?\"\n\nI say, \"No I was actually quite comfortable & if I wasn't here, wouldn't you have to pump the gas by yourself anyway?\"\n\nShe says, \"But that's the point. You're here. A woman should never to pump gas while a man's in the car. My dad, uncle, cousin, brother, nephew, whoever would've never just did what you did just now.\"\n\nI say, \"Well, Im not them & I don't subscribe to that. Can we go now?\"\n\nMind you, the whole time were having this conversation she hasnt even started the car.

I get out & start walking down side streets to a friends place. She's following me calling my name & my phone, but I ignore her & eventually lose her when she gets stuck at a red light.\n\nSince last Friday I've been getting all sorts of angry messages & texts from her friends about how Im not a real man for not pumping gas & even my friends were telling me, \"Yeah, man, you should always pump the girls gas, its just principle.\" \n\nThat whole week was Finals week so I didnt really pay too much attention to what they were saying but Finals ended yesterday & I'm home now for Christmas. My extended family is all here, so I decided to ask them if a guy should always pump gas for the girl. I'm confused because all the men are saying yes, but all the women are saying that while they appreciate the men doing it, they can also do it by themselves, even when a man is in the car.

She was so lost. \n\nHaving help from time to time is nice - say you\u2019re at the gas station and you need something from inside; having one person run inside to make snack purchases while the other pumps the gas and wipes down the windows is always nice, shared effort and all that.

OP is not an AH but I do think it\u2019s a kind gesture that my husband pumps my gas for me.", ">never expects, but appreciates it from your husband\n>expects it from son\n\nhmmm", "No. The girlfriend is definitely an AH.", "Her communication of her expectations still put her firmly in the AH territory.", "Agreed.  It\u2019s a chivalrous gesture that makes you feel cared for. If I am to think I am getting shortchanged in life by being female, I will take the perks of not having to carry heavy stuff and my husband pumping the gas. IDC if that is sexist.", "What makes her pumping gas inherently dangerous, especially with him literally feet away", "So she should cook him dinner every night and blow him on command right?", "What are you respecting by pumping?", "So she should cook him dinner every night and blow him on command right?", "Do you cook him dinner every night and blow him when he wants?", "So someone taught you sexist bullshit? Eww", "And couldn't she have communicated that like an adult?", "Fellas, is it toxic masculinity to pump gas for someone who gave you a ride?", "\u201cChivalry\u201d code for, I don\u2019t see you as an equal so I think I have to do this for you. Gross. Stop.", "This here\n\nIf my girlfriend told me to go pump the gas for her car, sure...pretty normal thing to volunteer your boyfriend for lol\n\nGetting pissed and demanding an apology for not offering to pump the gas isn't even close to normal behavior. That's super sexist and not a great sign they're mature enough for a serious relationship.", "Yeah attitude is everything here. Conceptually I have 0 problem pumping gas for my girl, because it\u2019s just pumping gas. But if she expected it, and went _that_ insane over it? We\u2019d have a problem.", "I prefer \"misogynistic bigotry\".  Entitlement is \"you should do this for me because I am more special than anyone\", bigotry is \"you have to do this because you were born a certain way\".", "It\u2019s one of those things you might lightly heckle each other over. I feel like a lot of partners have that occasional, kind of whiny banter that makes sense with each other (will you pleeeeeeeeaaaaaaaase do it??) but it also comes with the mutual respect and understanding that it\u2019s not actually being demanded of each other. If I ask my bf to do something like that he\u2019s not afraid to say no, so it\u2019s not a problem if he \u201cgives in\u201d and says yes to me being a brat sometimes, because he knows me being a brat in that instance is a joke and not a real part of me, if I act pouty for a second afterwords he knows it\u2019s supposed to be a joke. I\u2019d never respond to him saying no like she did in the post.", "Old men who are proud to never have changed a diaper (despite fathering several) and old women proud to never have pumped gas are two super weird flexes to me. \n\nI'll admit I'm not the bungee jumping/spelunking type of person.

He rocks.", "Yup I send him a message on linkedin before, but he never got back to me, so rude.", "Misandry*", "I forgot to take it further. Let me add on:\n\nNot everyone shows appreciation the same. Just because he didn\u2019t think of doing that nice gesture at that moment doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s an AH in any form. He could very well show his appreciation in some other form of love language.\n\nHolding him accountable based on that standard is not fair at all.", "Had they not been in an airport since 9/11?", "If I asked to pump the gas for anyone that drives me they would think that I\u2019m having a stroke.

She needs to grow up INTO  a young lady still. She's a lite girl.", "My dad always drove but that was more to do with my mom being a terrible driver", "My partner almost always drives.  He\u2019s the worst to have in the passenger seat so unless we\u2019re going somewhere nearby, he generally does not let me drive - it\u2019s not a pleasant experience for either of us to have him be the passenger.\n\nThat being said he is trying more and more to let me drive a bit more and trying to become more comfortable with it.  But I know he\u2019ll never be as comfortable as when he\u2019s driving.\n\nHe\u2019ll always pump gas regardless of which of us is driving, but it\u2019s by no means required, he just does it, I think partly out of habit since he\u2019s the driver.  OP\u2019s girlfriend is batty for making it such a huge deal.", "Was in NJ recently and we had to top up on gas. One of the drivers near us started to drive away with the pump still connected because they didn't realize that the attendant had yet to remove the nozzle.\n\nYeah, so much safer.

Equal society means just that. You don't pick and mix", "Same. \n\nBut my dad would NEVER, never, ever under any circumstances, sit in the car & have my mom pump gas unless he was physically unable.

People can pump their own gas in counties with fewer than 40,000 people.", "It makes it less likely that people will accidentally leave their car running.

I think I know where you\u2019re from!", "And meet them at the gate upon their return.  It was very nice actually.", "In NJ the driver doesn\u2019t typically get out of the car.  I guess technically they could check the nozzle in the mirror, but honestly it never even occurred to me to do that, I just go when the attendant says I\u2019m done.\n\nI\u2019m not from there, but have driven through several times.", "I can't even imagine a gas attendant pumping gas for me. That's just pointless and awkward. It doesn't happen here ver. Regardless people here don't leave their car running here either or light a cigarette in the gas station. Why you may ask? Because they know that would be incredibly dumb and dangerous.", "Yeah born and raised in NJ, driving for 7 years. Maybe it\u2019s confirmation bias amongst my friends, but I\u2019ve never met anyone who didn\u2019t double check the nozzle in the mirror before going.", "My mother had me pump her gas with the car running. I've seen people light up at gas stations. I'm not saying this because it could happen Im saying it because it does happen.", "Maybe that's because they aren't used to doing it themselves all time?
