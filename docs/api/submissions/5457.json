My car was in the shop & she came to pick me up from work & on our way back she decides to stop at a gas station. \nWe pull up to the machine, she looks at me funny for a moment, doesn't say anything & then gets out the car & starts pumping her gas. When she gets back in the car, I ask her what the funny look was for & she says, \"Really? How do I have a man in the car & I'm the one pumping gas?\"\n\n\"Because its your car & youre the one driving?\"\n\nShe says, \"Wow. And you're not even a little bit embarassed? Watching your girlfriend pump gas in the cold while youre sitting in the nice, warm car listening to music?\"\n\nI say, \"No I was actually quite comfortable & if I wasn't here, wouldn't you have to pump the gas by yourself anyway?\"\n\nShe says, \"But that's the point. You're here. A woman should never to pump gas while a man's in the car. My dad, uncle, cousin, brother, nephew, whoever would've never just did what you did just now.\"\n\nI say, \"Well, Im not them & I don't subscribe to that. Can we go now?\"\n\nMind you, the whole time were having this conversation she hasnt even started the car. The gas station is filling up w/ cars & shes literally hogging a machine.\n\nShe says, \"I'm not moving until you apologize.\"\n\nTo make it even worse, the guy waiting in the car behind us walks over and politely taps on the window and says, \"Hey, sorry, are you guys leaving or...?\" She rolls down the window & asks him, \"If your girlfriend or wife was driving, would you still pump her gas?\" He says, \"Uhhh, probably?\" & she looks at me victory & we finally move.\n\nShe says, \"Seriously, don't ever do that again\" I probably should have let it go, but I couldn't: \"No, if we're in your car and youre driving, youre pumping the gas.\" She starts going off again until I cant take it anymore. I get out & start walking down side streets to a friends place. She's following me calling my name & my phone, but I ignore her & eventually lose her when she gets stuck at a red light.\n\nSince last Friday I've been getting all sorts of angry messages & texts from her friends about how Im not a real man for not pumping gas & even my friends were telling me, \"Yeah, man, you should always pump the girls gas, its just principle.\" \n\nThat whole week was Finals week so I didnt really pay too much attention to what they were saying but Finals ended yesterday & I'm home now for Christmas. My extended family is all here, so I decided to ask them if a guy should always pump gas for the girl. I'm confused because all the men are saying yes, but all the women are saying that while they appreciate the men doing it, they can also do it by themselves, even when a man is in the car. They're all still arguing downstairs & its getting pretty heated so I decided to write to you guys to ask AITA & should I apologize?", "created_utc": 1671811449, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztkkiw/aita_for_not_pumping_my_girlfriends_gas/", "score": 314, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They don't interrogate the small number of things they've been taught to do that benefit women because they don't correlate them with all the oppressive norms and see how they fit together and reinforce each other.", "Haha--thanks!", "Did it for you!! \ud83d\ude02", "In that situation I'd probably offer a few bucks for gas money, but i wouldn't pump for them", "THIS", "My always pumps the gas when I'm driving and vice versa.  But that's because:\n\na. We're married and\n\nb. The gas thingy is on the passenger side\n\nBut if I'm driving anyone else,  I pump my own gas", "Guess your partner makes you move the sofa and refrigerator too. Stay strong. Let us know when you've been together for decades", "Where do you people live and in what century? Also, if he had picked her up, would she then have to thank him by pumping the gas for him?", "That's not how it works. Maybe if they were going to be driving a few hours but you don't fill someone's tank for a ride home from work.", "In all honesty, how do you think OPs girlfriend would react if his expectation was that she cook and clean for him? Maybe, just maybe, she would have your worldview. But I\u2019m willing to bet some serious $$$ she would be offended as hell.", "I would never ask my gf to fill up my car if I was driving. Filling up the car also implies paying, and fuel is very expensive these days", "I thought you had to have a ticket and go through security to even get to the gate, so I don't see how a random person can do that or even be expected to do that.", ">It's perfectly fine if you're both fine with it, but also they don't cease to be sexist because you're fine with it.\n\ndingdingdingding", "Exactly. Gas money sure. Pump for my friend? Uhh..no.", "Why are you moving the sofa and fridge so much????", "Twenty years strong. \n\nAnd your response is completely irrelevant. Moving a fridge by myself does not equate to someone pumping gas into their own car. Stay ignorant.", "I wouldn't know personally because I was born in the late 90s, but from what I've read online, pre-9/11 it was actually rather common to be able to go all the way into the airport and wait at the gate with the person taking the flight", "Yeah we used to go in and have a meal with my cousin when we'd drop her off for visits home (she lived with us for college) in the 90's, and further back my grandad used to be allowed to actually escort his mother onto the plane and load her bags for her.", "Yup. You could go to the gate for pickup too. We'd do it for my dad when I was little and he was flying out for a few weeks away.", "Yes, this was pre 9/11. It still wasn\u2019t super common bc the person waiting would have to pay for airport parking, and probably walk a good ways.", "Yes, that was common even in the early 90s. I remember my little boys waiting for me to get off the plane and it was adorable.", "Yeah, that's true. But I don't think that story took place 20+ years ago."]}
