It was a great girls night and when she announced more North American dates over the summer for 2024 we made plans to go again. We all knew it would be a fight (again) to get tickets that don\u2019t cost a kidney each so we picked two cities and all signed up for a shot at the presale. Out of all of us I was the only one that got an actual code while the others got wait listed. We had an agreement that I would get the best possible tickets if able within the agreed upon price that worked for all of us and they would just pay me their share. We all also agreed to split travel costs as well.\n\nThe assigned ticket day comes in July and I\u2019m actually able to get four awesome seats. I was floored. I hopped on the group chat to let Jessie, Ashley and Laura know that we had tickets and how much each owed. Jessie and Ashley responded immediately excited about the tickets and sent the funds over. Laura was silent. A few days go by and still nothing from Laura. I texted her separately to see if she could send her share for her ticket. No response. Two days later she posts on IG that she moved out of state for a \u201cfresh start\u201d and needed space. She said nothing to any of us and we\u2019ve all been friends since elementary so we thought it was odd. \n\nWe all kept trying to reach out for a few weeks but Laura never responded so eventually we kind of gave up figuring she\u2019d reach out if and when she wanted. As far as the three of us know we didn\u2019t do anything to cause her to ghost us like this but it is what it is. Not wanting to waste the ticket and just sell it to some stranger, we invited another friend Lorraine (28F) and she gladly accepted and transferred money over for the ticket. Since her stepmom grew up in the city we are attending in, her step mom offered us her condo she owns and stays in part of the year as she won\u2019t be there at the time of the concert. This was a huge relief since she didn\u2019t want us to pay and just wanted to know all of us were staying somewhere safe. This all happened in October.\n\nLast week Laura messaged the group chat saying she was sorry for cutting us off but she needed a mental break. She told us she knew that we had given her ticket to Lorraine and felt like we were all \u201ca bunch of bitches\u201d and not being good friends. There\u2019s been a ton of back and forth in the group chat and I\u2019m just exhausted with it honestly. I told her she ghosted us for months and never paid for the ticket, that I had paid for the ticket and wasn\u2019t going to sit around and hope she came back around. She started posting on IG about all of us playing the victim and calling us assholes and all the rest. This was a decision made between Jessie, Ashley and I to invited Lorraine, not just mine alone yet now I\u2019m being blamed and scapegoated by Laura\u2019s friends.", "created_utc": 1703188314, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18nvmf1/aita_for_selling_my_friends_taylor_swift_ticket/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While I can appreciate you needing a break, the truth of the matter is you made a choice to completely ghost three people who care about you. Your only contact was to complain about my selling my extra ticket (because it was mine to sell - you\u2019ve given me not one penny in reimbursement). So for five months you disappeared. Mental health is absolutely important, but your journey to wellness apparently is predicated on ghosting friends and posting about your ghost on IG. Explain, please, why I\u2019m getting blamed for your lack of communication? All we wanted to do was support you and your first point of contact was to be a witch towards us.\u201d\n\nNTA.", "NTA \n\nShake It Off", "She went no contact. Her fault. Her loss. NTA", "NTA. What did she expect to happen when she owed you hundreds of dollars and ghosted y\u2019all??", "She ghosted you for 3 months before the 3 of you decided to give the ticket to someone else.

There was no way you could have supported her through this. And NTA. Sucks to be her. But, this is not a \"group\" problem.

I'd post to her social media: \"You sound like you're still wrestling with your baggage? And I am so sorry for it. But, you can depend on me to support you as you focus on you.  I get it, and even when I miss you, I'm happy to understand your self-imposed isolation and leave you be. I love you enough to respect your needs for space when things aren't healthy for you. So, you go work on your stuff again. Only you can work this out because its between you and you. I'll check on you in a few months. Bye honey.\"\n\nShe'd find out just how much of a B werd I can be.
