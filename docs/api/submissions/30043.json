They were going to a nature area where they'd visit lakes, streams and stuff with a guide that would explain various plants and animals. It not off-road, but rugged terrain, pretty far from a city\n\nAll was good until the van that would be driving them pulled up. Apparently the son of the guide is the chauffeur on this tour, 23 years old and has Down Syndrome, and i wasn't okay with that. I asked the guide if he would drive, and he said no, his son would. At this point, I decided my kids would not be going on this tour, and after I said that, a couple of other parents agreed. Let me be clear, this conversation was not infront of any kids or the driver.\n\nOther parents called me an ableist asshole, and other harsh terms. Ive interacted with people with down in the past, and I really don't believe I am being ableist. But, knowing what I know about Down  , I dont feel safe letting my kids in the car. I ended up taking my boys home, so did a few other parents.

That teen has a licence, so who are we to say if they are a good driver? Well, statistics show that the teen is about 5 times more likely to get in a crash than a 40 year old driver. \n\nWould the dad be an AH to say that their kids aren't allowed in a vintage muscle car? The driver has a license, so should we all pretend that the car doesn't lack modern safety features and the risk of crashing is much higher? How about not allowing your kid in a very small car that is proven to be much less safe in crashes?\n\nHow about a driver the dad knows hasn't slept much the night before? It's well documented that it's more dangerous, but they have a license and it's legal. is the dad an AH to keep their child from that car? What about a driver using legal prescription drugs that are safe to use while driving, but the dad is concerned about the driver's mental state? \n\nIf the only acceptable standard you draw is legal and licensed, then you should be okay with all of those.

They've kept their license this long, that's better than my own mother has done (fuckin' drunk).", "Bro I watched 3 people with downs unable to figure out if a spoon is metal. Idk if I trust them to drive", "I know...it's the most bizarre thing ever. I'd never let my kids hop in a car with a mentally disabled driver. WTF.", "It's not *proof*, no, but it's a standard that basically all of us are happy to use (if only for want of a better one), and OP surely is most of the time. If OP accepts letting a stranger without Down's Syndrome drive their kid around despite having no way to tell they're a safe driver but refuses to make the same leap of faith for someone with it, that's ableism.", ">I\u2019m just saying that \u201cthey have a license\u201d is not proof that someone is a safe driver.\n\nAnd it is not even clear that he has a license.", "OP mentioned the disability specifically. If OP did not mention it, then perhaps public opinion would shift.", "They didn\u2019t feel comfortable *because of their bigotry* and ableist views. That, 100%, matters in this discussion.", "I guess that's fair. No one knows the driver's capabilities. So if OP wanted to know if the guy was good to drive, they should've stated their worries and asked the person who does know. Shouldn't have been too much of a problem since OP doesn't mind being rude about the subject.", "You parents and your shitty attitudes lmao", "With that attitude of yours it\u2019s a miracle you\u2019re even willing to call them human. How does it feel to be so unabashedly ableist?", "Screams of \u201cI can\u2019t be ableist I know a ton of folks with Down syndrome\u201d \ud83d\ude44we get it.", "So first you're saying OP is ignorant, second that she's not. Make up your mind, will you?", "Yeah normal people don\u2019t have an iq of 75", "I agree. But people are weak willed and lazy and they tend to trust the authorities, the government, the licenses, bla bla bla.", "See how trusting the OP is?", "I really do not believe you\u2019ll ask your kids\u2019 school bus drivers if they have ADHD.", "But I think you're misunderstanding the abilities of someone who has slower processing speed. As I said, *they still drive well enough to get their driver's license!* And you're *really* going to ask everyone you meet if they have a learning disability, genetic disorder, history of brain injury, ADHD, or anything else that means they might have slower processing speed? Because if not, then clearly you don't care about your kids' safety enough. But no, you won't, because doing that would make you a pretty obvious AH to everyone around you, so instead it's easier to just make snap judgments about people whose abilities you have no actual idea of.", "I mean it sounds like you have car related trauma that means you wouldn't trust most people driving children in a car but the point is that even people with zero disabilities have days where their processing ability is impaired. Driving hungry or tired or upset or in my case on my fucking period (not helping the hysterical women stereotypes unfortunately but it is what happens for me) slows down my ability to focus so I try and take precautions to limit that and avoid driving under those conditions. But your trauma does not give you a pass to write off an entire group of people with a genetic condition as \"unsafe drivers\".", "No, I work in special ed with kids who have learning disabilities and am well aware of the wide spectrum of abilities and the importance of not putting them into boxes. Slower processing speed doesn't relate to math specifically, it's a part of everyone's cognitive profile and can affect many other areas of learning and functioning.", "So why would someone with Downs Syndrome who has a driving licence be more of a risk than anyone else with a driving licence?", "And you think an extra chromosome is going to increase the chances of that?", "I have worked with many students with Down\u2019s syndrome and I\u2019m definitely not an expert.  I was not aware that some individuals would have the capability to drive.  I\u2019m aware that there is a huge spectrum and I don\u2019t happen to work with students that don\u2019t need a lot of support. Clearly I need to educate myself further.

Like the driver being short or gay or Black?", "And? Discrimination based on mental isn\u2019t any better", "For real, I remember my driving test. I wasn't even required to go on the road! I just drove around a small loop track they had and had to do a 3 point turn and that was it.

Life must be so much easier if you can just hate others randomly because you\u2019re told to.", "Why assume someone is driving without a liscence? No business would risk that kind of lawsuit disabled or not.

You are ruining my impression of Reddit as a place devoid of responsible adults. \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut seriously, thanks for this exchange.  I learned something, too.", "I love this attitude so much, you\u2019re a good egg.", "One is 90 and the other is 23. Why would a 23 year old be presumed to have slower reflexes and mental degradation as in someone of advanced age?", "I do know that businesses have to be insured and that no  insurance company would allow the nature preserve to put an unlicensed incompetent driver behind the wheel with children passengers! \nI\u2019ve dealt with corporate insurance and they are no joke about stuff like that because they\u2019re the ones that would have to pay out in the event of an accident!!!", "Is cognitive decline due to age really comparable here?", "So you're saying that you at 23 should have been presumed to have as bad reflexes and memory for the rules as your own grandmother, because 7 years is such a long time? Or that your 90 year-old grandmother only took her test 7 years ago, and should be presumed to be as competent as a 23 year-old?\n\nOr are you claiming without any basis in fact that all learning disabilities are exactly like being an aged person who has slow reflexes as well as memory problems, compounded by the fact she's seen the rules of the road updated many times in her lifetime and can no longer remember which apply?\n\nBecause my entire point was that a 23 year-old will have been tested to modern standards and his reflexes won't have started to degrade significantly yet. And that a disabled 23 year-old will not have less skill than a non-disabled driver; he wouldn't have gained his licence in the first place if the examiner didn't think he was capable.", "But that is based on your personal knowledge of them, right?  Again, that's different.  I don't want to get in a car with my uncle because he gets road rage.  This is perfectly reasonable.  I don't then say that all people his age or all men or all people with whatever arbitrary characteristics in common with him are unsafe drivers.  That would not be reasonable.", "Well then don't get in any car ever with someone else driving\n\nNo school busses for your kids.  No public transit.  No carpools\n\nEnjoy\n\n\"Nobody has to know why\"\n\nExcept OP made it very clear why.  Didn't even drive their kids to the nature preserve themselves.  Just took them home", "That's funny, I didn't know you needed a CDL to drive a bus. My husband bought one last year for fun \ud83d\ude33 I'm glad we never got pulled over. Yikes.", "This is like saying that all autistic are mute since some people with autism are completely non verbal . It's a very wide spectrum. Some people will need help their whole lives, others go on to university and to start families.", "They'd probably not pass a driver's test, then.", "It is ableism, but when it comes to their kids safety, I can understand someone following their gut, even when it\u2019s not PC. \n\nI still say NAH, even if it\u2019s unpopular. OP did not insult anyone or cause a scene, simply removed their children from a situation they were uncomfortable with. The reason doesn\u2019t really make a difference to me.
