Nope don\u2019t give them a penny and block them all. NTA", "NTA and now is the time to go no contact. Now.", "Money turns people into parasites. People will literally kill for a few dollars. So I am not surprised that your father and his affair partner are circling above you like vultures.\n\nNTA", "NTA - you just say if mom wanted you touching her money, she woulda wrote you into the will. Byeeeee", "So sorry about your mom and grandparents. That just sucks.\n\nLife isn\u2019t fair sometimes. \n\nI hope you have lots of great memories to carry with you!!", "NTA you're not even related to them, they're not even half siblings, correct?  You'd still not be the AH though.  Although if it's some insane amount of money maybe you should look into what charities you want to support.", "NTA- Wow! That\u2019s some nerve! If I were you, I would make a will right now and make sure it stipulates that your father and his family get nothing if you die. Otherwise he\u2019s next of kin and people do crazy things when money is involved.", "NTA don't give them a penny. \nThe moment you do you won't hear the end of it and will keep asking for more.", "NTA\n\nI would tell friends suggesting 10%, it isn't good to reward bad behavior.  Mom wouldn't have wanted that money to go to them and they proved it by yet again acting terrible.  They don't deserve the money!  \n\n\nIf you decide to give them any which you definitely shouldn't tell them you are going to pay the step siblings schools directly because otherwise it very well may get wasted.", "NTA. You know what's heartless, OP's dad? Breaking up your kid's family so you can screw someone else, and then when your kid has lost their mom and grandparents and is in the middle of profound grief, barging in and demanding money for your cheating partner's kids, as if they owed you for prioritizing your dick over their childhood.", "Definitely contact your lawyers about it, and if necessary file a restraining order for harassment.", "NTA\n\nIf your friends are so concerned about daddy's finances they can cough up their own money to support him. \n\nAs for your father, tell him that your grandparents had no desire to share their wealth with him going by the pre-nup they made him sign.", "I'm so sorry  you lost your mom and grandparents. I imagine you're still grieving. What a bunch of assholes your dad and step-mom are to be pestering you about this. Especially so soon. Make no final decisions, either way, for at least a year. Maybe two. This was a big loss and clearly the other adults in your life aren't there to support you.", "NTA\n\nIf we were talking about your *mom's* stepkids \u2014 that she was heavily involved in raising \u2014 things would be different. But you obviously have no moral obligation to give her money to the children of the two people who destroyed her marriage.\n\nYour dad thinks he's a clever opportunist, but he's just delusional.", "No, they have no right to your money, and should not have asked.  They are emotionally blackmailing you.  Move on with your life and ignore them.", "I would never give my mom's money to my dad's mistress. Ever. \n\nThey aren't even half siblings. They are HER kids. Nta", "NTA - just tell them no. It doesn't sound like you had a relationship with them, and now they want your money. The step siblings college is their parents' responsibily - what would they have done if your mother and grandparents hadn't passed away? They can do that now.\n\nHave your lawyer write them a letter - not to contact you or your boyfriend with regards to your money. Your boyfriend should block their number and needs to just tell them to leave him alone.\n\nEdit: whatever you give them, it won't be enough. They'll be back for more, and more, and more, until there's nothing left to get.", "I\u2019ve always looked at others children as not your child not your problem. You\u2019re not the asshole, it\u2019s not your responsibility to take care of anyone else child even family. It would be nice but is not required.", "Your friends are a holes!", "If you give in and pay for their university that will be the beginning not the end. You will become a resource to them and they will try to bleed you dry.", "NTA First of all, i am so sorry for your loss. To lose 3 people in a tragic accident is heartbreaking. Im sorry that your father is just a money hungry pig and doesn't realise the grief you're going through. Him and his wife have no shame. You just lost your family, and all he cares about Is getting money from you, not even supporting you emotionally while you grieve.\n\nDo not give them a dime. You give in, and they will know their non stop harassment can wear you down, and they'll just keep asking for more. It won't end.\n\nFile a police report for harassment or lawyers for a ceast and desist if possible.", "NTA. That is not their money whatsoever, don't budge on this. That money is for you only. You sound pretty strong in your resolve, but definitely don't let up. Your father is an idiot for asking to begin with.", "NTA!\n\nIf you - on your own - had any feeling of connection to your dad's step-kids AND your own desire to gift them something, you could do that.\n\nBut your dad and his wife have no right to ask, much less demand, MUCH LESS HOUND you for anything. The fact that they are doing that would make me want to take steps (a lawyer's letter telling them to cease and desist) to make clear to them they are getting nothing from you.", "I can\u2019t believe the audacity of some people. Do not give them a dime. Otherwise, they will continue to beg! Your money is not their money.", "NTA.  Its your money, so you can do as you please.  However if your mother and grandparents wanted them to have part of the inheritance, then they would have included them in the will/estate.  Money brings out the bad side of people.  I'm sorry for your loss.  Put that money to good use in your life.", "NTA. Very sorry for your loss. Also, sorry that shitty family is preying on your loss as some sort of lottery ticket.", "NTA give them nothing. The same amount of care and time they gave you.", "NTA. Your friends are welcome to contribute if they're so opinionated. Your father and his affair partner fucked around and now they can find out.\n\nEdit: and if he keeps whining about how you're heartless, tell him you learned to be heartless when he cheated and destroyed your family. Then block them everywhere.", "NTA if your friends think your step siblings should get 10% tell them they can help your dad out. That is your money. And yours alone!", "NTA", "NTA.  You are no more responsible for supporting your dad, his AP or their kids than your mom or grandparents were.  If he wanted their money, he shouldn\u2019t have cheated on your mom.", "YTA. These are family members (your dad and his family). How greedy are you?", "NTA. Op should tell his dad and stepmother to go harass  the step kids biological  father for money instead of trying  to use money that came from a woman that was betrayed.", "Nta. Let them know that if they continue,you'll have an attorney draft a cease and decist because of their harassment. The audacity of that man to cheat on her then demand her family's money.", "\"...I don't see them as my family.\"\n\nThere's a reason for that. Because they are NOT. They are not your family in the slightest, not in any way, shape, or form.\n\nNTA.", "The woman who your dad cheated your mom with now feel entitled to your mom inheritance? Do you feel how wrong it sounds worded like that? NTA", "NTA\nDon't give them anything,  they will kerp coming back for more.  Tell them you will seek legal action if they don't stop pestering you about money and block all of them.", "NTA. Do not listen to your friends. You give them a little they will keep asking for more and more. They are not entitled to your money.", "Your mom had a prenup that I am sure your grandparents talked her into. Which is very smart. If these bat $hi% crazy people think they are entitled to any of  this money they are off their rocker. These people broke up your family and now expect to benefit from their deaths? I get that the step kids have nothing to do with their parents actions. But they are not related to you in any real sense and your mom, and grandparents did not leave them any money. If they wanted them to have money they would have stated that in their wills", "NTA. Don't give them anything. They don't deserve to inherit from people who had nothing to do with them. Please don't. You need to get your affairs in order. Your will, your POA, and don't mingle your finances with anyone you are not married to. You are a still young", "NTA\n\nGet that lawyer\n\nAnd make sure to never NEVER let them into your house. These money grabbing types will stop at nothing.\n\nBetter to go No contact completely already.", "Don\u2019t give them a dime, your dad made this mess he resides in now, live your life in peace. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing, condolences on your loss and take care of yourself.", "NTA. What would make you the a-hole is taking money that your mom and grandparents left you and give it to the guy that cheated on her/their daughter, and the kids of the homewrecker he cheated with.\n\nNext time they ask, just say \u201cYou aren\u2019t getting a dime of mom\u2019s money, not even a penny. Haven\u2019t you both taken enough from her? How dare you ask for more.\u201d", "Invest it.  Don\u2019t spend the principle, just take out and use the profit in earnings.  This way the money is working for you and you\u2019re not losing money.   Once invested, the money is gone, hard to get out, unlike a savings account.  Sorry, invested, can\u2019t get it out.  If you invested in real estate, what would they expect you to do? Give them couple of rocks?  Can\u2019t get it out.  Long term investing.", "NTA. They are out of control. So sorry you are dealing with this.", "NTA. Don't give them anything!  Don't give anyone any money not even the bf.  That is yours and for you.  Others will try to take advantage and say no.  If you ever loan any money get a promissory note or an iou.", "Nta. You're now in charge of the money, and it's inherited all to you. They don't owe you anything.\n\nYour dad made his bed, he can lay in it. What he did to your mom has now bit him back in the butt, so he has no say in the inheritance.", "NTA. As long as you do not give In to your fathers demands. How much do you think your mother and her parents would like to see any of their money go to the children of the woman your father ditched your mother for?", "NTA\u2026 make sure to make a will as well ensuring nothing goes to your father or his family if anything happens to you.", "NTA. Do not give them a dime. Not one. They only care about money. You lost your mom and grandparents and this is what they talk about. Cut them all out of your life and be as happy as you can", "is this real? looks like ai generated\ud83d\ude12", "NTA They aren\u2019t entitled to a penny of it. If you don\u2019t feel like they are family then they aren\u2019t family.", "But haven't you heard? Family doesn't ask back the money they have given as a loan, it's called being greedy and disgraceful.", "What  a load of bunk", "Those people are not OP's responsibility. They have been surviving on their own when OP's mother was alive, and they can continue to do so. They are not entitled to OP's money at all and OP should just cut complete contact with these parasites", "OP didn't earn the money but the money came from OP's money, you know the woman OP's dad cheated on. OP is not responsible to finance their siblings education, they can take loans like normal people do \n\nBut if being a \"good person\" means so much to you then drop your contact information and OP will pass it to their father and step siblings. They will be happy to know that you are willing to finance them", "This is dumb. All this will do is show them that enough nagging will result in payday.", "People that would do this would not pay the loan back.", "And if he gives them anything it will be considered an opening wedge, and evidence of entitlement, and it will go on and on.  Do talk to a lawyer\u2026", "Kind of chutzpah, for the cheater to blackmail his victim. \"You owe me and my affair partner money for having wrecked your childhood family, and it's now also your job to support the homewrecker's kids your adulterer dad abandoned you for. You should be grateful for the privilege of catering to my selfishness.\""]}
