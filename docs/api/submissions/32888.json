They were not mentioned in the wills. The mother and grandparents had NO intention to leave the steps, who are random strangers, anything.\n\nNTA. You owe them nothing.", "Unfortunately, since her dad was once married into the family, he already knows about the money.", "Not only will the father and stepsibs keep asking for money, but others will as well. It\u2019s never a good idea for someone with money, especially newly with money, to look like they\u2019re a soft touch or will give in if harassed enough.

What a silly silly man! The step-kids are literally nobody to OP & are not her damn problem!", "Oh, these \"friends\" will have their hands out soon and visit with a tin cup.", "LOL. \u201cWow, just think of all the money you\u2019d have right now if you\u2019d been faithful to Mom.\u201d", "His children are not OP's responsibility.

Once OP does that, the pests will ask for more.", "Something is deeply wrong for them to even ask, let alone be harassing you guys with demands. Absolutely do not give them anything. As someone who dealt with something similar, ignore them and do not give in. They are terribly out of line to think this would be appropriate. Definitely stand your ground & speak to an attorney. I\u2019m sorry for your losses.  If it helps to consider, based off the situation you described I doubt your Mom or grandparents would want those people getting any part of their estate. Best of luck! Stand your ground!", "You can\u2019t give into harassment, or it\u2019ll never stop.

I also pray you have  amazing support from your friends and mom's side of the family.", "This right here is why these people deserve nothing.\n\nAlso, if you haven't had a good relationship with your father since your parents divorced, he deserves nothing. If they haven't been nice to you these past years, they deserve nothing. If there has been a good relationship and they weren't harassing you, then I might consider it. But never forget that your Dad cheated and he is now still with the mistress. I obviously don't know the whole story but I am going to go with NTA and do not share. Not only are they not entitled to anything but based on what I know, they are deserving of none of it. You could also simply ask yourself what your mother would do if she were in your position.", "Thanks for responding. All the best to you.", "Yikes.  I feel bad for you. NTA.  These people are not family", "NTA\n\nAre you willing to go no contact? \n\nIf yes Public Shame may work.

You think they will stop bothering you if you give them 10% or anything at all. Absolutely not!! Once they waste the money they will come back for more. \n\nThe balls your dad and his wife have are HUGE. The fact he cheated on your mom and married his AP is disgusting. And karma took his job for it. And her kids aren\u2019t even your half sibling they are step kids. You have ZERO obligations to all 4 of them. \n\nBlock all of them everywhere.

Without sharing the actual amount, is it less than $3m USD or is it closer to 10m? Different answers in those cases.\n\nIf it's less than three, hold the line and don't share. That's a magic number, that invested properly can set you up with a very nice income for life. Example: $3M at 7% annual interest is $210,000/yr forever. \n\nIf it's considerably more than that, and you feel led to share something with your step siblings (and right now that sounds like a big if), then forget a percentage. Just come up with a nice gift amount, such as $50,000 each. Give it as a gift, not as their share because they don't get a share. It needs to be a paper check, not cash, and give it in person - you will be able to gauge their response.\n\nAnd be prepared for them to react with something disappointing, like \"is this all?\" If things get really ugly, sadly, you can call the bank and cancel the check if necessary. \n\nRegardless of the amount, if you don't feel led to share your inheritance, absolutely do not and don't feel bad. You may have a future family someday of your own.", "I'm sorry for your loss.

Her money is better spent getting an attorney and a financial planned than giving a single penny to the cheater and his new wife.", "That's great that you're in a financial position where if you inherited $1M, you'd stick your nose up at the paltry amount. \n\nAnyway, the amount was for illustrative purposes showing that giving 1% of your inheritance would seem like a lot to them, but a tiny dent in the overall inheritance, and enough where you could tell them to piss off.", "I thought this was the Only Bad Advice subreddit.", "Your father's new family sound awful.  These type of people will never be satisfied until they get ALL your money.  The advice above is good.  Take it.  Your are NTA.", "I can't help but think this would be like a blackmail situation.
