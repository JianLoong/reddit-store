You\u2019re living with a toddler. Five years olds can wash their own dishes and put them in the dishwasher. \n\nNTA", "NTA this has to feel even. Maybe skip the cereal argument bc if she\u2019s happy eating that fine, you\u2019re not her parent, but dishes and a shareable car are hardly large expectations to have for an adult. However as some folks said lecturing didn\u2019t seem to work. You may want to seek a third party\u2019s help even if just temporary so this is handled constructively as it seems you\u2019re at your wits end and she isn\u2019t changing thus far with what you\u2019ve tried. \n\nReddit is quick to jump to just dump the person but obviously you married her for I assume multiple reasons and if it were me I\u2019d try every avenue I could for something  such as home maintenance before throwing in the towel. (Not that you suggested you were on that path, just a thought). \n\nMeal prep, complimenting the help people give even if she does something small, scheduling such as hey how about Tuesday from 5-6 we just get it all done and then let\u2019s have a nice dinner out, I can\u2019t wait to take you to xyz place / make you abc to try that night etc, or in my case I\u2019ve found figuring out where we both do better works (he hates dishes and laundry but he doesn\u2019t mind doing the evening dog walk. Deal) for us. He doesn\u2019t cook so if I\u2019m not up for it (or right now our gas is off) he can choose what to order in. No prob. For the car, well, I\u2019d do what I do when he fails to put his stuff away. It\u2019s going in whatever drawer I see open of his or his closet. His mess his problem. Obviously dirty thing I throw in the hamper but you get my drift ;)\n\nYou\u2019re not an AH. What I always say is if what you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t working (In anything with anyone) change your tactic. \n\nAlso maybe get yourself a nice night at a hotel for a day. Say I\u2019d love if we can do this together but I don\u2019t want to say something I\u2019ll regret as I\u2019m rather upset you don\u2019t respect my feelings enough to make me comfortable in my own home. \n\nAll else fails, a mediator is not a gateway to life long counseling. Everyone needs a third party perspective sometimes.", "NTA. It sounds like your wife is using weaponized incompetence to not do any chores.", "I think it's a little more nuanced than that. Here one is working 50 hours plus commuting and the other doing 40 from home so the one doing 40 from home has quite a lot more spare time and should be doing more. Not all but more", "Wtf are you talking about? She doesn't do anything. You would be blaming the shit out her if the genders were reversed", ">She\u2019s exhausted. Doesn\u2019t matter why. Her job might be exhausting. She might be fighting isolation and depression.\n\nYou're giving a lot of benefit of the doubt.  You do realize that some people are just lazy and kinda selfish, right?", "\u201cPlease please, I need a detailed itinerary with documentation of your chores because I really really don\u2019t want to say the woman is the AH.  No you literally already stating she doesn\u2019t do any housework doesn\u2019t answer my question, that too unilaterally makes her the AH.  I need to find some nitpick where I can pin the blame on you as well, you deserve it for being a man.\u201d", ">You both need to clean\n\nBut he does, and she doesn't.  So where do you get E-S-H?", "exactly! At my house if I work less than my partner I will do the housework, and from the point where my work hours plus housework hours equal my psrtners work hours we split 50/50 again. Lately I've been working more so the reverse is true. \n\nas an example:\nI work 45 hours, partner works 40. Let's say there's 15 hours of cooking and cleaning a week for this example.

The mental work is often more exhausting and different than the exhaustion that comes with throwing your body at it.", "You notice how you\u2019re constantly comparing how you spend your time in order to position your time as more valuable than hers? It\u2019s part of every single claim you make about how she isn\u2019t cleaning enough. That\u2019s what makes me think YTA. You\u2019re dysfunctional and resent one another and you\u2019re doubling down on those feelings and cleaning constantly and obnoxiously so you can feel and say that you\u2019re better than her.
