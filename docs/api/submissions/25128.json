You're wife is a flaming asshole!  I'm sorry that she has cancer, but what she did to your daughter was very abusive!  If she is unable to deal mentally with her disease and treatment, then she needs professional help, not to manipulate and coerce your daughter into making a choice that she didn't want to make.  Make no mistake, she ABUSED your daughter.  \n\nHonestly, cancer or no cancer, if I were in your shoes, I would seriously be considering divorce, if only to get your daughter to safety.", "NTA\n\nI hope your daughter moves out when she can.

She sounds like she needs it desperately.", "NTA, your wife wanted to use your daughter as a prop to her cancer. She knows she's going to survive (presumably) but she wants the attention she will get from it. Forcing your daughter to sacrifice something that is probably very memorable about her so people can gush about it is her way of getting more attention.\n\nIt's unbelievably toxic, what she's done. The manipulation is honestly shocking. The power behind showing support through shaving your head for a cancer patient is that it's unasked and voluntary.

I think you were right to take your wife to task.\n\nWhen things are calmer, I would try to discuss this again with your wife, and explain your disappointment that she twisted Anna's arm to do something she didn't want to do by employing really, REALLY bad parenting technique \"If you don't do this you don't love me,\" e.g. That shit is absolutely toxic and CANNOT continue.\n\nWhile your wife did something egregious, hair will grow back, and the damage is done. But it might be worth getting some family counseling. As you said, your wife is going through something really traumatic, visible, and scary. It's also possible that you have some of your own things to sort through (of course, cannot tell from this post alone, but even mentioning she had a near 100% chance of survival seems to possibly imply you think she shouldn't be so upset...?)

That is rude, cruel, self-centered, and extremely entitled.  And very, very wrong.\n\nOP, just because your wife has cancer does not give her the right to force your daughter to do something this traumatic.  You already know this.  This would be a deal breaker for me - and I am a cancer survivor!  If my spouse did this to my child, I would take the kid and walk out.  There is no way I would tolerate this and I am glad to see you are taking a stand for your daughter.\n\nJust because you are sick does *NOT* give you the right to someone else's body.\n\nTell your wife to grovel to your daughter for forgiveness and to go buy her as realistic of a wig as she can, ASAP.

Your wife is indeed manipulative, and she clearly guilt-tripped your daughter into getting her hair buzzed off. The good news is, hair grows back.

I could never look at her the same again", "NTA. I feel for what your wife is going through, but what she did to your daughter is awful. She emotionally manipulated and strongarmed a teenager into lopping off her long hair. Bearing in mind this girl is at an age where she would be very self conscious about her image, and now she's having this do to deal with and all because she doesn't want her mother to hate her.\n\nYour wife is a piece of work, I'm sorry to say, and I sure hope emotionally manipulating your own child into cutting off her hair is worth the years of resentment that will follow. What you do now is extremely important. Do not sweep it under the rug, take charge and make sure she can't abuse her anymore.", "NTA \n\nBut I would be furious if someone did that to a kid in my family. \n\nI would look into things your daughter can have done until the hair grows out... wigs... fun dye colours.", "NTA.

And a FUCKING BUZZ at that\n\nI have a feeling thar you're going to be dealing with the repercussions long after your wife is in remission.", "NTA, that was extremely manipulative of her to do to your daughter. Her illness is not an excuse.", "Your wife goes through hard times and I wish you all the best. As I wish you both that you can fix your relationship.\nyou are NTA because your wife cannot just make someone do what she wants just because she has cancer and is envious of others.

It might put more strain on the relationship after all", "NTA \n\nYour wife was completely unreasonable and manipulative. Having cancer doesnt excuse someone from being called out if theyre being a dick.\n\nShe was a collossal asshole and should apologise to your daughter. Then seek some therapy as she obviously has some unresolved issues she needs to work through. My bet is she saw this as either a great way to garner positive attention or that she has taken some form of issue with your daughter having hair when she cant. Maybe im wrong and just being judgemental. Cancer is horrific. I have had two close family members die of it the past 3 years. But it doesnt stop someone from being human, sometimes part of being human is being a jerk. You did the right thing and she is absolutely in the wrong.", "NTA, it doesn't even show true support if you force your daughter into it by manipulation.

Cancer is no excuse for that behaviour towards your daughter.", "OP -  good for you for standing up for your daughter. I'm so sorry she got caught in her mom's trauma. 100% NTA for you. \n\nFor your wife - has she exhibited other behaviors in the past that would border on this level of abusive or manipulative? Or is this new since her diagnosis? If the second, I'd strongly recommend some family therapy, preferably with someone who has experience with family dynamics while a family member is experiencing serious medical problems. You guys can establish what norms and behaviors are and are not OK. Your wife needs to understand that what she did is not acceptable. \n\nIf you see other evidence that your wife might do other things that put your daughter at risk, then you need to find a way to protect her.

Where a relative who worked in medicine took time off to take care of their wife during their battle with cancer.  They prioritized them and their care to the point that they had to quit their job to give them full time at home care so they wouldn't be in a hospital for extended stays.  \n\nAfter nearly two year battle they survived, but things had soured.  They insisted that their husband had abused them. But here's the thing.  They had frequent visitors from family and friends and no one ever saw abusive behavior. She claimed there was a lot of physical abuse, but no one ever saw signs of it.  And she was on ***heavy*** chemotherapy.  Something that is known to cause hallucinations and other issues with memory.\n\nShe went to almost half a dozen therapists all of them counseling her and helping her work through it. And all but the last one came to the same conclusion that everyone else had. That her chemo had caused her to hallucinate abuse from the experience of struggling with the cancer.  The last one told her what she wanted to hear and she broke things off with him.  And before or since he's never had any allegations of abuse, nor signs of being abusive.  \n\nThe reason I'm sharing this is that this could, in part, be due to the chemotherapy your wife is going through.
