Yes my daughter got married at 18. Her ex husband was also 18 at the time. Me and her father did not think that getting married that young was a good idea, but supported her as she was an adult.\n2. I did not have a good understanding of what the marital problems my daughter was experiencing, but she confirmed that there was no abuse from her ex husband.\n3. She has always been a very private person, but that has never been an issue as she has always been honest with us.\n\nOnto the update. I received many messages and comments from you all, and I do appreciate the advice and wisdom all of you gave.\n\nI think the thing I struggled with the most was being lied to. I felt hurt that my daughter didn\u2019t want to tell me the truth. But I realized that this discussion wasn\u2019t about me.\n\nSo I asked my husband for advice, and he recommended my daughter and I sit down together and talk it out. My daughter agreed to talk to me, with the condition that my husband mediate.\n\nMy daughter started the conversation with that she didn\u2019t tell us about the true story about her boyfriend for two main reasons:\n\n1. She was worried about being judged by me. And I confirmed her theory. Hearing this made my heart so sad. To see that my own daughter was worried about my judgment.\n2. My daughter admitted that she was ashamed for how things down with her divorce. She and her ex were going through some rough times, her work schedule being crazy, and her husband being depressed contributed. She met her then boyfriend during this time and confided in him about this. Before she knew it, she was texting him every day, and even going to his house to hang with him and her friends. She realized at that time she was wrong. So she filed for divorce, and they started officially dating the day after her divorce was final. She again said she didn\u2019t physically cheat, but admitted she was not proud of how her marriage ended. \n\nThe conversation then went to my side. I reiterated that I supported her and her boyfriend. He is a kind and nice man, and he treats her well. And that I loved her unconditionally. I apologized for how I acted, and asked if she could forgive me.\n\nShe accepted my apology, and did tell me that while my words hurt, I am still a good mother, and that my love that I\u2019ve given her and her boyfriend has been consistent, and that my actions spoke to that.\n\nWe agreed to go to some family therapy together in the future, to continue to work out these feelings. We cried, hugged, and I think things will be ok. People can screw up, including myself as my last post shows. But ultimately, good people will always be welcome in my home, and I never plan on changing that.", "created_utc": 1683922206, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fvn4o/update_aita_for_telling_my_daughter_that_im/", "score": 552, "replies": ["Well, I'm glad you were able to work it out.", " It sounds to me like both you and her learned some things and grew a little. WTG \ud83d\udc4d", "I once read that 80% of people in a committed relationship met their significant other while they were in a committed relationship with someone else.  Not sure how accurate that is but I can say 100% that is true of every single relationship I have ever been in.  If your daughter is telling the truth I don't see how she or her sig other could have handled themselves any better.  I'm glad you came to an understanding and worked your way through this.", "I remember reading the original post.\n\nI\u2019m glad you guys cleared the air and I commend you for being able to reflect on your own traits/behaviours.\n\nI hope your daughter and her partner are very happy together and that you all continue to have an excellent relationship.", "Reddit amazes me once again. Emotional cheating is still cheating. Not telling someone you did something shameful because you\u2019re ashamed doesn\u2019t make you right. Yeah the situation was grey. She should have told you. Regardless. It still doesn\u2019t make her \u201cwaiting\u201d a year right. They didn\u2019t wait a year. They were already \u201ctogether\u201d before her divorce.", "Did she apologize for lying to you? It also doesn't seem like your daughter has taken full responsibility for her cheating either. If you emotionally abuse someone, it doesn't make it any better to say, \"well I didn't physically abuse them\". Emotional cheating is still cheating.", "Yeah so when she was still married she was going to his house to... do the cleaning? Sure. She was afraid of the judgement because she knew how bad the screw up was, and made it even bigger by not being woman enough to own it. Excuse me but I have no sympathy for her. And she is still lying.", "I'm glad you guys got to a good place. It sounds like your daughter hadn't realized she was falling for someone else until she was already in deep and probably never consciously intended to emotionally cheat on her husband. Even at the big age of 30 a crush can sneak up on you, and I'm glad you guys were able to get into the crux of the issue.", "She doesn\u2019t need to tell her mother everything. Once she realized what she was doing, she ended the marriage. Emotional cheating doesn\u2019t always begin intentionally (unlike physical cheating) and she did the right thing once she figured it out. I don\u2019t see anything wrong with the sequence of events . Real life is messy and filled with grey. We are all humans trying our best. I don\u2019t. See any villains here", "She didn't have to tell her mother anything. She didn't have to tell her on a specific timeframe either.", "Getting close to someone while married and abusing someone are not anywhere near the same. Get out of here with your high horse.", "She literally said she was going to hang out with him and his friends. Unless you're implying she went over to get a train ran on her, there's no reason to believe her infidelity went beyond emotional. It's still fucked up, yeah, but you have no proof she's lying, just your own assumption that two people can't be within walking distance of a bed without screwing.", "Yeah you are right is an assumption, doesn't sit right lying for so long about the end of her mariage.", "Thank you for this, it\u2019s really nice to have a post that shows mature, caring decision making. I\u2019m glad you all cleared the air.", "She wasn\u2019t forthcoming because she didn\u2019t trust her mother to not judge her. That was the problem. \n\nThat being said I hope you can repair your relationship.", "I don't understand why you get to have any feelings about your daughter's actions in her relationships, especially when it seems above board. The \"emotional cheating\" is a ridiculous notion if she isn't emotionally supported or has been emotionally deserted in her marriage. She should be congratulated, empowered and applauded for not settling and doing what was right for her. This seems like an individual therapy need rather than a family therapy need.", "ESH, this is a way to make peace, but it doesn't really address the real problems, it's like a bandaid fix.", "What would you recommend, if an honest, open conversation and an agreement to pursue family therapy isn\u2019t good enough?", "Affair. I think the word you're looking for is affair. \"Getting close to someone\" is just softening what she actually did. She had an emotional affair, just because it didn't get physical doesn't make it any better. But it seems to be a sticking point with the daughter, so my example was to show that it doesn't actually matter, she still cheated.", "Was it really honest and open though?  It's not like the daughter has truly owned up to what she did.  \n\nThe daughter did something awful, and was afraid to be judged for it.  Mother cares about her child in distress and is essentially seeking the bandaid fix to resolve the conflict.  \n\nFamily therapy doesn't really work here because it's not truly a family issue... it's just daughter masking it as that to avoid the real issues.", "Sounds like you were the victim of an emotional affair and haven't healed from it yet.", "Honestly, it's not her mom's business, and considering she was right about OP being super judgemental if she found out, she had every right to keep the real story to herself.", "That doesn't answer the question of what you would recommend.", "Nope. But I've seen what it does to people and how it gets downplayed.", "I'd recommend that a cheater learn to take responsibility for their actions instead of doing what they do typically and try to divert towards a different perceived issue to distract.", "Please detail exactly how the daughter should take responsibility for her actions to her mother, who was not the person she cheated on.", "Well she could have done so by not keeping it a secret.  Understanding why she kept it a secret, instead of doing the typical cheater thing and blaming something else for it.", "It's not always about the mistakes you make, but how you recover. I'm proud of you for doing the work necessary to heal your relationship with your daughter.", "This is why cheaters keep cheating, there are literally zero repercussions. Everything works out for them and they leave the carnage behind them and everyone is too afraid to pass judgment. So long morals.", "Your daughter is still a cheater.", "Tell that to the people who were cheated on and end up so damaged from it that they get into worse and worse relationships...", "For the record, I wasn't trying to come across as sarcastic or judgemental.", "So you don\u2019t like that she didn\u2019t blame someone else? And you don\u2019t like that she came clean to her mother?", "Lmao so you tell your mother all your worst secrets too? That's insanely inappropriate and controlling behavior. Regardless of age, no one owes their mother that.", "Came clean after they had gotten the story from her friend?\n\nShe trickle-truthed them for 3 years, and sometimes outright blatantly lied.  \n\nAnd even after they had a sit down chat... she put the blame on the mother and fear of judgment... which is just a cop out... for didn't want to be held accountable for being a cheater.", "Is this the hill you want to die on? Really?\n\nOP is doing family therapy and had a table talk with her daughter and spouse. What else is there to do? Would you like the daughter to go around to everyone she knows and tell them her personal buiness?\n\nWhy do you assume she owes *anyone* the truth outside of the ex? Because she doesn't.\n\n OP states daughter said she was ashamed. \nDaughter held herself accountable by ending the marriage and clearly there are people in her life who knew. Just not her mom.\n\n Daughter then went on to list mitigating factors to her being unhappy in the marriage which seems to have led to the emotional cheating she is, and again \"Ashamed\" over. \n\nWhat the hell would you have done? Gone and willingly told your mom?", "I dunno, man. It\u2019s like you read both the posts for only what you wanted to see. You\u2019re really going to tell me that you\u2019ve never withheld info from someone for fear that they\u2019d judge you because you knew it was wrong? You\u2019re a 100% perfect person all the time? You\u2019re full of it.", "So she leave her depressed husband ..oh.  i hope that man is better now", "Wow. Adults don't owe other adults explanations about their relationship. What happened or didn't happen is none of your business.", "I\u2019m glad you got to a good place but you were not TA. If your mom can\u2019t tell you the truth, who can?", "No longer the AH Yeah\n\nlove good communication", "Until the daughter and boyfriend have issues and story repeats, daughter finds another person to have an emotional affair and all of that.\n\nOr be happy forever?", "developing feelings for someone else while dealing with a troubled marriage is not an emotional affair, and she chose to file for divorce when she realized her feelings. exactly what everyone is always preaching you're supposed to do if you develop feelings for someone else while married.", "Noted, she  emotional cheating ,when her husband was depressed", "I mean, given her mothers reaction, and the reactions of people like you immediately calling her a cheater, I don't blame her.", "reddit throws out the words emotional affair far to often. she got close to someone else while dealing with a troubled marriage and realized she had to end things when she developed feelings for said person. calling that an 'affair' is a stretch. there's honestly no winning with you people sometimes. obviously married people are just never allowed to know other people cause God forbid they discover they aren't happy with their marriage or develop feelings for someone else and do the right thing and get divorced, cause you'll all still be here to scream about them being a cheater \ud83d\ude44", "'cheater' \ud83d\ude44 buddy get over yourself. I swear to God there's no winning on reddit sometimes. she did exactly the right thing by ending her marriage when she realized she had developed feelings for someone else and there are still a bunch of self righteous assholes preaching about how she's an immoral cheater", "She literally is an immoral cheater, and then she lied about it for years to her parents.\n\nIt's sad watching people like you get all whiny about very clearcut things just because you, like the daughter, would rather pretend other people are self-righteous aholes, instead of just admitting maybe you just aren't a very moral person.", "If my secrets directly affected her it would be insanely selfish to keep them from her and let her operate from a place of ignorance instead of having as much information as she can to make the decisions that would feel right to her.\n\nIt's cool that you think you don't owe your mother honesty in events that would impact her though.  You remind me of the people that cheat on their spouses and think it's fine to keep it a secret because it would be too inconvenient for them to share it with the spouse and deal with the fallout, and they just tell themselves it's their business and not their spouses.  Just such a selfish me-first everyone far below me in priority mindset.", "How the hell does that directly affect her? Youre unhinged if you think those are appropriate boundaries to have. Not everything is your parents' business and especially not your relationship issues. I get that you're triggered by this cheating thing, but this line of thinking is highly controlling behavior and leaning narcissistic.", "Right now that we know the whole story, I have to be honest, I take a lot of if not all of my previous judgement back because your daughter hasn\u2019t exactly been the decent person in her broken marriage especially towards someone with mental health issues that she\u2019s now likely worsened with her actions but I\u2019m glad she herself mostly realises this and feels accordingly but now I think she should\u2019ve been honest/owned up\n\nI really take it back, she definitely deserved to be judged before but with guidance to take proper accountability alongside with it", "Who hurt you?", "But she did consciously choose to confined in her issues with another man before all this"]}
