You asked her to stop, it is making you feel needlessly like crap, it is degrading these other women that you have nothing to do with at this point, and you observed - rightly - that yeah, actually, if you \\*have\\* a \"type\", you ended up with her in the end.\n\nHer commentary on how vile or disgusting your taste is by its very nature will boomerang right back at her, in that sense.\n\nIt just sounds insecure and mean-spirited and unnecessary. Hope you get to talk it out, at least.\n\nEDIT: That said, thinking on it a little bit, I do wonder why these other women come up so much. If the context is \"Oh, I wonder what she's doing now\", I sort of get it (I've been curious about random exes before now), but it isn't really the sort of thing you should be making a top three conversation for no reason if you're feeling secure about stuff.", "NTA. I've actually dealt with this issue a few times. I tend to just pretend like they didn't say anything or be really vague. There's no reason to bring up past relationships, especially when you two are married lol.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s insecure. Tearing down other women is such gross behavior and she needs to get over herself. Being beautiful doesn\u2019t give you the right to trash on other people.", "I think she\u2019s fishing for compliments.", "It\u2019s really uncool of your wife be dragging other women. No matter how they look (which they can\u2019t really help), it doesn\u2019t mean she gets to rip on them. \n\nNTA.", "Info: why do you spend such a significant amount of time discussing exes? Not saying what she's doing is good, but talking about your past relationships enough to make this an issue seems weird.", "NTA, but it seems like this is a constant problem. She must be really insecure to be bringing up the situation all the time. Confused on how this happens to often", "NTA. She could easily just make a joke about being prettier and keep it stepping, but chose to be mean. She brings it up to make herself feel better, dragging you down in the process. You were being fresh, but not asshole enough to be left or ignored.", "NTA. But for a knock out that knows it your wife is hella insecure.", "I'm just confused with the frequency of these conversations about your exs? And how much focus you are making on an ex. \n\nMy husband and I aren't precious about bringing up past relationships, it's hard to talk about your life before your partner without a brief \"I travelled to Reykjavik with my Ex and this is the experience I had....\" or something similar. But even then, without the need to sensor (my brother's wife will not allow any mention of his ex's so he has to think carefully or sensor how he talks about past experiences), it doesn't happen that often. And also usually just a very brief \"I had this experience with an ex\" or \"my ex's family did this....\" The mention of the ex is usually an extremely small part of the actual discussion/conversation. \n\nSo, is this how your conversations are going, are you just mentioning them as a brief part of the bigger picture of what you're talking about and your wife is grabbing hold of that small section and running with it. Or are you having big  discussions about the people themselves? \n\nUnfortunately you wife is being insecure, I'm just trying to understand if the insecurity is rooted in the fact that you bring up ex's a lot or talk about them in depth, or if it's nothing to do with what you're doing and something she needs to work on herself.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA but a smartass ^^", "NTA. Play stupid games. Win stupid prizes. Good for you.", "NTA. Hilarious comeback though! Your wife sounds kinda insecure and childish. Dont talk shit about others to make yourself feel better, thats a bit toxic imo. And dont dish it if you cant take it.", "so, shes allowed to bash other women and say some pretty fucking nasty shit about people she doesnt even know so she feels better about herself but when you get sick of her never shutting the fuck about it (thats what i assume shes doing) SHES the one who gets offended. NTA\n\nalso OP, imma be honest, your wife does not sound like a nice person at all. seems like she lets her good looks go to her head and now she thinks shes better than other women.", "NTA. She can dish it but can\u2019t take it? She\u2019s projecting her insecurities onto those women, and in turn, onto you. I can\u2019t stand people who talk shit about others\u2019 looks & put them down for it - but I can\u2019t imagine being around someone who never shuts about it. Insufferable. Especially when it also reflects on and hurts you. Sorry OP. Sounds like she needed to hear that comment and maybe it will make her think twice before talking shit in the future, since you politely asking her to stop didn\u2019t work.", "esh, please stop talking ab your exs so often\n\nthat being said do you maybe compliment your wife often? maybe that\u2019s why she\u2019s insecure", "She is insecure and may have other serious mental issues. Please pay attention to her behavior, character and how she loves to pick fights. You may be ignoring red flags that are dangerous in relationships. She may make you feel insecure or doubt certain choices or actions and become dependent on her. She may be beautiful but flawed on the inside.", "Justified A H isn't an option so ESH she was an AH and so were you... she was the bigger one", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just a mutual person she knew who I described as cute the first time we met and I wasn\u2019t even pursuing", "It\u2019s not a significant amount of time but probably once a month the subject will somehow arise. The girl I called cute I never dated or pursued, just described her as cute when trying to figure out if she knew her from work\n\n///edit///\n\n*I described the girl as cute the very first time my (now) wife met and I thought had a boyfriend. She brought up today that I had thought she was cute back then and how disgusting she actually is", "It's starting to sound like OP is bringing it up by sharing stories from the past.", "It is definitely more of a side detail i.e. talking about going to Popeyes Village in Malta after watching a travel vlog and I was with someone I was dating at the time when I visited. She zeros in on the ex detail and starts the whole bashing routine", "And we can always count on random Redditors to read between lines that aren't even there and insist someone is dangerous despite zero evidence.", "How does the subject of your exes come up if you don't like discussing it?", "I know you said she knows she\u2019s attractive, but in my experience, confident people don\u2019t just start bashing other peoples looks. Unless they\u2019re a real asshole. Which I\u2019ll give her the benefit of the doubt and say your wife isn\u2019t the latter, at least not regularly.\n\nYou said you guys talked but have you directly addressed why she feels the need to bash the looks of these other women? Women who have literally done nothing to her? Start there. Because until she starts addressing her insecurities, this behavior is unlikely to stop.", "that is a little often tbh. i\u2019ve been with my bf for 6.5 years and i can\u2019t remember the last time any exes or past flings were talked about. probably like 6 years ago.", "On one hand, I think discussing exes should be avoided. On the other hand, your wife shouldn't be saying nasty things about other women, especially since they're not even around. But once a month still seems often.", "I travel often and anyone I date ends up doing a lot of traveling with me. Genuine question, am I not allowed to talk about my experience in Malta (or wherever) because I was dating someone else at the time and they were traveling with me? The story will about some unique restaurant or bar or whatever, not about the person I was dating or traveling with, she is the one who then asks who I was with, were we dating, etc.", "Yeah that's shitty of her. So it sounds like it's something she needs to work through herself. There shouldn't be issues of bringing up an ex in that way, like I said it's difficult to talk about what you've done in your life without that brief mention of who was there. My husband has an ex wife, he was with her a long time, so she pops up now and again in conversation and it's no big deal, he had a life before me. Her looks don't make a difference to any of it. \n\nPersonally I would suggest that outside any of these conversations where she zeros in on an exs looks you bring it up to her and tell her it needs to stop, that it's insignificant in what you're talking about, that her doing that is her devaluing what you're actually trying to talk to her about and her making what could be a normal conversation into something thats unappealing and potentially causing arguments or issues within your relationship, it's unnecessary. Tell her you can't keep accepting it and if she continues to interrupt a conversation to bitch about someone's looks then that's her showing what she deems as important (basically her thoughts on looks are more important than what you're actually trying to have a conversation about) \n\nIn your post you mentioned you've told her how it's made you feel, what was her reaction to you telling her that??\n\nThen if she does this in the future after the talk, cut her off \"this isn't relevant to what I'm trying to tell you, can I continue what I was saying please?\" \n\nIf she doesn't stop and allow you to continue the conversation, simply \"we've talked about this, I'm sorry but I don't want to hear what you have to say\" and remove yourself. Harsh, but I think it will let her realise what she is doing.", "Yeah, maybe you need to have that checked \ud83e\udd28\ud83d\ude06", "It\u2019s always after some sort of funny story or a travel story that happened while with an ex and she starts going in on their looks", "I agree, been with my husband for 7 years and exes or past flings only come up naturally about once every 6 months or so - and that\u2019s only if we hear from or see them", "I'm inclined to agree. I've been with my boyfriend for over 4 years, and we don't really talk about our exes at all. There's just no point in it. We already know each other's past trauma from relationships, so it just isn't necessary.", "Hmm. Have you thought of just telling her that it doesn't matter who was accompanying you? If you travel a lot it would make sense that a lot of stories would involve places you've visited. Or simply tell her to stop asking questions about who went with you if she's simply going to sap all the fun out of the story. This is making me lean more in the NTA direction.", "ESH. Stop bringing up stories with your exes since they're such a sore spot for both of you. Your wife needs to work on her insecurities.", "Congratulations, Sherlock, you just cracked the case.\n\nStop talking about your exes, it's clearly tormenting your insecure wife. ESH because she's over sensitive, but it's not that uncommon for people to dislike hearing about their partner's former partners, and you're avoiding an easy fix here for no reason.", "The point of the stories are never about the ex. It will be about a traveling somewhere and something serendipitous or funny happening. An ex also being there is such an insignificant part of the story, should I just lie and say I was alone or with a male friend traveling? That seems like a road I don\u2019t want to go down and definitely don\u2019t want to keep track of lies because I can\u2019t say I was with a girl in fear of setting her off", "The only thing I spend money on is traveling. Anyone I date also travels with me. Am I not allowed to tell a funny story about a guy shitting himself at a bar in Paris because the person I was dating at the time was also there? Am I supposed to omit the detail of an ex being there too?", "Why not respond with \"it's not important\" or \"it doesn't matter\" upon her first inquiry?", "If you haven't already, I'd say it's time for a very frank discussion with your wife about why she feels it's necessary to be so unpleasant and say such ugly things about someone who isn't even a relevant part of the story. She's making a concerted effort to find out who you were with for the express purpose of tearing them down. That isn't normal. I misjudged this initially, I think. NTA.", "You're allowed to do anything you want. Your dilemma is that you know talking about your exes upsets your partner, and also that her reaction upsets you in turn. \n\nSo what are you looking for here? Permission to stick with the status quo? If so, you have our blessing - nobody has to live with the consequences except you two."]}
