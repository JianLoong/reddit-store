You asked her to stop, it is making you feel needlessly like crap, it is degrading these other women that you have nothing to do with at this point, and you observed - rightly - that yeah, actually, if you \\*have\\* a \"type\", you ended up with her in the end.\n\nHer commentary on how vile or disgusting your taste is by its very nature will boomerang right back at her, in that sense.\n\nIt just sounds insecure and mean-spirited and unnecessary. Hope you get to talk it out, at least.\n\nEDIT: That said, thinking on it a little bit, I do wonder why these other women come up so much. If the context is \"Oh, I wonder what she's doing now\", I sort of get it (I've been curious about random exes before now), but it isn't really the sort of thing you should be making a top three conversation for no reason if you're feeling secure about stuff.", "NTA. I've actually dealt with this issue a few times. I tend to just pretend like they didn't say anything or be really vague. There's no reason to bring up past relationships, especially when you two are married lol.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s insecure. Tearing down other women is such gross behavior and she needs to get over herself. Being beautiful doesn\u2019t give you the right to trash on other people.", "I think she\u2019s fishing for compliments.", "It\u2019s really uncool of your wife be dragging other women. No matter how they look (which they can\u2019t really help), it doesn\u2019t mean she gets to rip on them. \n\nNTA.", "Info: why do you spend such a significant amount of time discussing exes? Not saying what she's doing is good, but talking about your past relationships enough to make this an issue seems weird.", "NTA, but it seems like this is a constant problem. She must be really insecure to be bringing up the situation all the time. Confused on how this happens to often", "NTA. She could easily just make a joke about being prettier and keep it stepping, but chose to be mean. She brings it up to make herself feel better, dragging you down in the process. You were being fresh, but not asshole enough to be left or ignored.", "NTA. But for a knock out that knows it your wife is hella insecure.", "I'm just confused with the frequency of these conversations about your exs? And how much focus you are making on an ex. \n\nMy husband and I aren't precious about bringing up past relationships, it's hard to talk about your life before your partner without a brief \"I travelled to Reykjavik with my Ex and this is the experience I had....\" or something similar. But even then, without the need to sensor (my brother's wife will not allow any mention of his ex's so he has to think carefully or sensor how he talks about past experiences), it doesn't happen that often. And also usually just a very brief \"I had this experience with an ex\" or \"my ex's family did this....\" The mention of the ex is usually an extremely small part of the actual discussion/conversation. \n\nSo, is this how your conversations are going, are you just mentioning them as a brief part of the bigger picture of what you're talking about and your wife is grabbing hold of that small section and running with it. Or are you having big  discussions about the people themselves? \n\nUnfortunately you wife is being insecure, I'm just trying to understand if the insecurity is rooted in the fact that you bring up ex's a lot or talk about them in depth, or if it's nothing to do with what you're doing and something she needs to work on herself.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA but a smartass ^^", "NTA. Play stupid games. Win stupid prizes. Good for you.", "NTA. Hilarious comeback though! Your wife sounds kinda insecure and childish. Dont talk shit about others to make yourself feel better, thats a bit toxic imo. And dont dish it if you cant take it.", "so, shes allowed to bash other women and say some pretty fucking nasty shit about people she doesnt even know so she feels better about herself but when you get sick of her never shutting the fuck about it (thats what i assume shes doing) SHES the one who gets offended. NTA\n\nalso OP, imma be honest, your wife does not sound like a nice person at all. seems like she lets her good looks go to her head and now she thinks shes better than other women.", "NTA. She can dish it but can\u2019t take it? She\u2019s projecting her insecurities onto those women, and in turn, onto you. I can\u2019t stand people who talk shit about others\u2019 looks & put them down for it - but I can\u2019t imagine being around someone who never shuts about it. Insufferable. Especially when it also reflects on and hurts you. Sorry OP. Sounds like she needed to hear that comment and maybe it will make her think twice before talking shit in the future, since you politely asking her to stop didn\u2019t work.", "esh, please stop talking ab your exs so often\n\nthat being said do you maybe compliment your wife often? maybe that\u2019s why she\u2019s insecure", "She is insecure and may have other serious mental issues. Please pay attention to her behavior, character and how she loves to pick fights. You may be ignoring red flags that are dangerous in relationships.

Genuine question, am I not allowed to talk about my experience in Malta (or wherever) because I was dating someone else at the time and they were traveling with me?

So it sounds like it's something she needs to work through herself. There shouldn't be issues of bringing up an ex in that way, like I said it's difficult to talk about what you've done in your life without that brief mention of who was there. My husband has an ex wife, he was with her a long time, so she pops up now and again in conversation and it's no big deal, he had a life before me. Her looks don't make a difference to any of it. \n\nPersonally I would suggest that outside any of these conversations where she zeros in on an exs looks you bring it up to her and tell her it needs to stop, that it's insignificant in what you're talking about, that her doing that is her devaluing what you're actually trying to talk to her about and her making what could be a normal conversation into something thats unappealing and potentially causing arguments or issues within your relationship, it's unnecessary. Tell her you can't keep accepting it and if she continues to interrupt a conversation to bitch about someone's looks then that's her showing what she deems as important (basically her thoughts on looks are more important than what you're actually trying to have a conversation about) \n\nIn your post you mentioned you've told her how it's made you feel, what was her reaction to you telling her that??\n\nThen if she does this in the future after the talk, cut her off \"this isn't relevant to what I'm trying to tell you, can I continue what I was saying please?\" \n\nIf she doesn't stop and allow you to continue the conversation, simply \"we've talked about this, I'm sorry but I don't want to hear what you have to say\" and remove yourself.

I've been with my boyfriend for over 4 years, and we don't really talk about our exes at all. There's just no point in it.

If you travel a lot it would make sense that a lot of stories would involve places you've visited. Or simply tell her to stop asking questions about who went with you if she's simply going to sap all the fun out of the story. This is making me lean more in the NTA direction.", "ESH.

At the end of the day it doesn't matter what OP says, she is making him and herself miserable by giving priority to her insecurities rather than giving priority to his feelings or their relationship. And that sort of mindset is just toxic and selfish, and is unfair on OP, because all she is doing is punishing him for having a past. If he can't talk about a simple travel anecdote without her getting insecure, the problem is her, not OP.
