I purposely mentioned \u201cmy ego\u201d wanting to resist because I know I\u2019m not completely secure with myself either and I\u2019m aware of it. We\u2019ve talked about how to work on her insecurities and how I can be supportive while not being a doormat. \n\nIf you boil a person down to a single flaw they have, then of course they will be the most vile person in the world. This one (albeit large) character flaw of my wife does not define her. She is incredibly kind, funny, thoughtful, and supportive; I do truly adore her and can\u2019t imagine being with anyone else. Her actions are from deep rooted insecurities and really aren\u2019t about the other person she is insulting at all.\n\nAlso, the amount of you that want to just throw the baby out with the bath water was shocking haha but I get Reddit can be over the top with reactions.

You asked her to stop, it is making you feel needlessly like crap, it is degrading these other women that you have nothing to do with at this point, and you observed - rightly - that yeah, actually, if you \\*have\\* a \"type\", you ended up with her in the end.\n\nHer commentary on how vile or disgusting your taste is by its very nature will boomerang right back at her, in that sense.\n\nIt just sounds insecure and mean-spirited and unnecessary. Hope you get to talk it out, at least.\n\nEDIT: That said, thinking on it a little bit, I do wonder why these other women come up so much. If the context is \"Oh, I wonder what she's doing now\", I sort of get it (I've been curious about random exes before now), but it isn't really the sort of thing you should be making a top three conversation for no reason if you're feeling secure about stuff.", "NTA. I've actually dealt with this issue a few times. I tend to just pretend like they didn't say anything or be really vague. There's no reason to bring up past relationships, especially when you two are married lol.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s insecure. Tearing down other women is such gross behavior and she needs to get over herself. Being beautiful doesn\u2019t give you the right to trash on other people.", "I think she\u2019s fishing for compliments.", "It\u2019s really uncool of your wife be dragging other women. No matter how they look (which they can\u2019t really help), it doesn\u2019t mean she gets to rip on them. \n\nNTA.", "Info: why do you spend such a significant amount of time discussing exes? Not saying what she's doing is good, but talking about your past relationships enough to make this an issue seems weird.", "NTA, but it seems like this is a constant problem. She must be really insecure to be bringing up the situation all the time. Confused on how this happens to often", "NTA. She could easily just make a joke about being prettier and keep it stepping, but chose to be mean. She brings it up to make herself feel better, dragging you down in the process. You were being fresh, but not asshole enough to be left or ignored.", "NTA. But for a knock out that knows it your wife is hella insecure.", "I'm just confused with the frequency of these conversations about your exs? And how much focus you are making on an ex. \n\nMy husband and I aren't precious about bringing up past relationships, it's hard to talk about your life before your partner without a brief \"I travelled to Reykjavik with my Ex and this is the experience I had....\" or something similar. But even then, without the need to sensor (my brother's wife will not allow any mention of his ex's so he has to think carefully or sensor how he talks about past experiences), it doesn't happen that often. And also usually just a very brief \"I had this experience with an ex\" or \"my ex's family did this....\" The mention of the ex is usually an extremely small part of the actual discussion/conversation. \n\nSo, is this how your conversations are going, are you just mentioning them as a brief part of the bigger picture of what you're talking about and your wife is grabbing hold of that small section and running with it. Or are you having big  discussions about the people themselves? \n\nUnfortunately you wife is being insecure, I'm just trying to understand if the insecurity is rooted in the fact that you bring up ex's a lot or talk about them in depth, or if it's nothing to do with what you're doing and something she needs to work on herself.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA but a smartass ^^", "NTA.

Her looks don't make a difference to any of it. \n\nPersonally I would suggest that outside any of these conversations where she zeros in on an exs looks you bring it up to her and tell her it needs to stop, that it's insignificant in what you're talking about, that her doing that is her devaluing what you're actually trying to talk to her about and her making what could be a normal conversation into something thats unappealing and potentially causing arguments or issues within your relationship, it's unnecessary. Tell her you can't keep accepting it and if she continues to interrupt a conversation to bitch about someone's looks then that's her showing what she deems as important (basically her thoughts on looks are more important than what you're actually trying to have a conversation about) \n\nIn your post you mentioned you've told her how it's made you feel, what was her reaction to you telling her that??\n\nThen if she does this in the future after the talk, cut her off \"this isn't relevant to what I'm trying to tell you, can I continue what I was saying please?\" \n\nIf she doesn't stop and allow you to continue the conversation, simply \"we've talked about this, I'm sorry but I don't want to hear what you have to say\" and remove yourself.

But, in all these other women,  you r definitely the most gorgeous! \"\n\nAnd I agree, it's an insecurity on her part. She wants u to say that she is way beyond the rest.\n\nNTA but maybe a bit insensitive.", "OP married Regina George", "Not to mention the bodily changes that pregnancy and childbirth bring.  Will she be resentful because the kid \u201cruined\u201d her body/looks?\n\nEdit: unrealistic expectations greatly contribute to post natal depression.", "What ghosts lol", "ya imo esh just because i think it's kinda dumb for op to be talking about how great his exes are...she is of course a grown woman who could not pick on their looks, but i can def see how she'd feel insecure.", "Or even a son. She's going to teach them it's normal and okay to talk about women this way", "I think the point is more that her bashing seems extra annoying if she's bashing someone who's objectively good looking", "The OP made clear that his wife is gorgeous, a real smoke show. Almost as if he doesn't think he isn't in her league. I get the feeling he brings up his ex's to show her that he is also desired by other women. I think they both have insecurities and should seek individual and couples therapy. Why does he keep pushing her insecurity button if not to stroke his own ego?", "Even worse, what if they have a daughter who\u2019s prettier? I can only imagine the jealousy and how the wife would find ways to cut the daughter down and undermine her confidence at every turn.", "^^^^^^", "Sounds like she is insecure OP. I wouldn't talk about exes or other people's attractiveness with her.  Just keep refocusing the conversation on what you love about her.  If she's this invested and insecure about her physical appearance now, oh boy when she gets pregnant things will go off the rails. If you make it through that, then you can deal with aging. Good luck.", "You have a history. She has a history. None of that matters if you are happy together.", "No kidding it\u2019s bad enough that she\u2019s clearly super insecure to the point that she has to bash other women but then to go into silent mode and won\u2019t talk to him is such a childish thing to do. She\u2019s not just insecure she\u2019s incredibly immature.\n\nThis is the type of woman who becomes their daughters first bully.", "She\u2019s a pick me girl who can\u2019t understand she was already picked.", "Gods forbid this woman has a daughter", "Yes! This! My dad is obsessed with weight. My entire childhood was of him telling me that if I just lost weight, I could be really pretty. Now, I'm 27, and no matter how skinny I am, I always think I look super fat. I have never been comfortable in my own skin and have zero confidence. OP, don't let her do this to your future children!

I've asked him not to do that but he refuses\"", "Very good point.", "I'm sorry, *disgusting*? That's an absurdly cruel thing to say about someone's looks. Your wife sounds like an asshole, like not just in this scenario but life in general. And you're an asshole for not caring about her cruelty, but how it hurts your ego to be associated with these \"disgusting\" women.", "It's at least somewhat misogynistic to consider the perceived attractiveness of your ex girlfriend as a measure of your value as a man. She isn't an accessory and she isn't a trophy.", "he mentions it in the comments, also it\u2019s not like she keeps bringing them up just to hate on them", "All of this. I had MAJOR insecurity issues when I was younger and coming from that to where I am now I can see how clearly she is struggling with how she views herself. Maybe even feels a woman's worth is in her looks, maybe even hates herself. If she wasn't so venomous in her attacks I'd feel sorry for her.", "i would break up with her over this, not because i cared about the exes, but because of what this says about her personality. She's like a bully", "YES.  or their son brings home a girl that she perceives as prettier or less attractive. Just a minefield of bad ahead.", "My guess is she\u2019s more insecure about her personality. Maybe she feels like all she has is her looks so she\u2019s threatened by girls who can get guys without being as physically attractive.", "yeah honestly like in a lot of the relationship stories here, we don't know enough from the SO's perspective...if a guy is talking that much about the exes, i can def see how she would feel like she is not being prioritized/insecure in their relationship, though it's not an excuse to put the other women down. feels bad to see everyone quickly calling her a bitch or a mean girl tbh.", "Same. People in general can make you feel very sad if you let them. Especially as his main complaint was about his ego, not their mistreatment. They both suck as people.", "My ex used to try to trap me into telling stories that involved past ex's. I turned my travel stories into \"with friends\" or I just wouldn't tell the story. It is a huge red flag to be that jealous and to keep trying to be jealous. NTA.", "For these stories, they are no longer your ex\u2019s, they are now your \u201cfriends\u201d", "Your wife says this because she wants you to enthusiastically agree with her. She\u2019s hoping you\u2019ll tell her that she\u2019s far more beautiful, smart, desirable than the Exs. She may not consciously realise that\u2019s the compliment she\u2019s fishing for.\n\nIt\u2019s up to you OP whether you feed her the compliments she\u2019s seeking, or answer her logically, but you\u2019re both miscommunications on this one. \n\nNAH", "May I just tell you OP, speaking as a wife of many years, that no wife, or husband for that matter, enjoys any anecdotes about their partners previous gf/bf. This is a subject that should not be taking centre stage in your convos.", "Bingo! Never bring up Ex stories\u2026", "---OR---\n\nFind someone who isn't so insecure with your past.", "Nobody should have to pretend they don\u2019t have a past just because their current partner is insecure.", "Lol what? So just pretend like your life didn\u2019t exist before you current relationship??? My last ex was a 4 year relationship and we went everywhere together, so what just never speak again of cool trips and stuff I did just because it was with an ex??? That\u2019s insane and if you can\u2019t handle hearing about someone\u2019s life before you then you shouldn\u2019t be in a relationship.", "Everyone on here being oh OPs wife can't handle jealousy in a mature way. Naw. Me thinks OP simply isn't using his noggin when he brings up stories and talks about his exes exactly the way you're describing. I had an ex that always name dropped his ex in stories that he would talk about fondly but it was more because he was still obsessed with the one that got away even though they'd been split for over 2 years. I confronted him about it and he said well you can't just erase my past. Bud, that's not what I'm asking you to do, I'm asking you to stop name dropping so much. I felt like the other woman in the ghost of a past relationship. It sucked.\n\nOP constantly mentioning exes is probably tanking his wife's self esteem and she's lashing out the only way she knows how. OP keeps mentioning that she's a smoke show but he can't connect that every time he keeps bringing up stories about his exes, she probably feels second best despite how \"perfect\" she is. She's constantly reminded she's still not enough for him because he keeps letting these other chicks occupy his headspace.", "Or don't date some so immature and insecure that they are threatened by previous relationships", "Um, ok?...........", "The wife is also reducing other women\u2019s value/attractiveness to their looks. Which is pretty nasty behavior.", "\"All male supremacists are misogynistic but not all misogynistic people are male supremacists\"", "This is so well said, and I wholeheartedly agree. People who haven't been in a relationship with someone who name-drops their ex(es) don't get it.", "This too! The contempt combined with looks-based valuation would have me slamming on the brakes with both feet. Completely unacceptable from anyone.", "No problem. It\u2019s become a shorthand for that.", "Pretty much exactly, well said.", "Came here looking for a comment like this lol. I was a virgin when I met my girlfriend but she's had quite a lot of relationships... including a 10 year one. Does it bother me? Of course not, why would it? She's with me. Is she not supposed to ever talk about her past? \n\nPeople need to learn how to handle jealousy maturely. I'm a super jealous person, it's like... my base personality to initially have that brief flash of *grrr, mine!* when I hear stories about her ex. But it's brief. It's a literal lightning bolt of emotion and then I internally chuckle to myself, pat the emotion on the head, and shoo it away because it's just a feeling and not reflective of reality. Her exes aren't lurking in the corner waiting for her to mention them lol, and they're exes... she isn't with them anymore, she's with me. Seems the pinnacle of insecurity to be afraid of people your partner rejected in the past while they are actively choosing *you.*\n\nIronically, making yourself an unsafe person for your partner to talk to for fear of your reaction is one of the quickest ways to kill a relationship. No conversation should be off the table. If open communication and feeling safe with each other to bring up anything is the cornerstone of the relationship, they'll never have a reason to hide anything from you.", "OP said he brings up his exes once a month. ONCE A MONTH.\n\nBruh his wife is definitely insecure but he should NOT be bringing up exes names once a month. \"I did this in this city\" doesn't take anything away from a travel story compared to \"Katy and I did this in this city\".", "Me and my gf comment to each other about how hot girls are. \n\nYou arnt wrong about the double standard, but I don\u2019t feel like he is intentionally bringing his exs up to hurt her. If you saw someone for long enough, when you break up you\u2019ll still have memories and stories about things you did while together. If my partner brings up a musician, I might say \u201coh yeah I saw them in (year) with (ex). It was a great show\u201d and if that effected her in a way that made her lash out, I\u2019d see that as a red flag. I\u2019m FRIENDS with some of my exs.", "That works with reasonable people, but people like OPs wife tend to dig/assume and then get mad about you editing the stories.", "If you have to edit for a new partnerthat's a pretty big red flag regarding their insecurities.", "\u201cit\u2019s just a feeling and not a reflection of reality\u201d EXACTLY!! You put it perfectly.", "Its never really bothered me either. My husband married me, so obviously he likes me more. All the mutual friends who knew the ex also flat out said that they like me a lot more than they liked her, so I never mind hearing about her. I find it interesting to get that little window into his life before meeting me.", ">It reeks of possessiveness, immaturity, lack of confidence\n\nbingo. In a guy, this behavior radiates small dick energy", "I don't agree. I doubt anyone in love wants to hear about past people in their person's life.... Seriously, ask a sample of 100 people and see what they say. Whenever you're with your person talking about other people they've dated, a tiny knot forms in your chest and travels up the back of your throat. Even if you're enjoying hearing about your partner's past, because it you're in love, you'll be fascinated with every part of them, there's still something that doesn't feel right about hearing of exes. A lot of people pass it off as jealousy, of insecurity.. but I don't think it's the unhealthy kind. I think it's completely healthy to be anxious to hear about relationships ending, to hear about close people in the past who they will never talk to again. It's deep down, a fear, an anxiety that you could be in the same position. It's a feeling like a litmus test to your heart.", "It could be.\n\nBut it's also likely it's unintentional and he's just a clueless idiot who talks about his exes a bunch.", "Or is he being the unreasonable one?\n\nWhy does he keep bringing up exes?  He says once every month or two?!\n\nI can't even remember the last time I spoke about an ex, and it certainly wasn't regularly with my wife (where he also goes Facebook stalking to find an old crush)", "Who talks about exes constantly after years of marriage?!\n\nYes, it could be insecurity, but it could also be the other person is still hung-up on their ex.  How do you tell the difference?\n\nIf you were just starting dating I could see how they come up in the course of conversation.\n\nBut after years of being married?  You've gotta have new stories by then.", "When I was young and insecure (I was VERY insecure) I had those reactions but as I've gotten older, worked on myself, and become more comfortable in my own skin I don't get those reactions anymore because I don't feel threatened by my partner's past. If anything I'd be concerned if he hadn't had relationships before me. \n\nI don't necessarily want to hear explicit sex stories but my partner telling a story where their ex was present does not affect me. Young me sure, I'd get into my head and make it about me in some way. But now I know better. If it affects you to the point of getting a physical reaction either it's because the other person has given you a reason not to trust them and your body is setting off an alarm. Or you still have some work to do on finding acceptance that your partner is with YOU and you are good enough, the fact that they had a life before they met you is not about you and not meant to hurt you."]}
