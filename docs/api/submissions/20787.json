You asked her to stop, it is making you feel needlessly like crap, it is degrading these other women that you have nothing to do with at this point, and you observed - rightly - that yeah, actually, if you \\*have\\* a \"type\", you ended up with her in the end.\n\nHer commentary on how vile or disgusting your taste is by its very nature will boomerang right back at her, in that sense.\n\nIt just sounds insecure and mean-spirited and unnecessary. Hope you get to talk it out, at least.\n\nEDIT: That said, thinking on it a little bit, I do wonder why these other women come up so much. If the context is \"Oh, I wonder what she's doing now\", I sort of get it (I've been curious about random exes before now), but it isn't really the sort of thing you should be making a top three conversation for no reason if you're feeling secure about stuff.", "NTA. I've actually dealt with this issue a few times. I tend to just pretend like they didn't say anything or be really vague. There's no reason to bring up past relationships, especially when you two are married lol.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s insecure. Tearing down other women is such gross behavior and she needs to get over herself. Being beautiful doesn\u2019t give you the right to trash on other people.", "I think she\u2019s fishing for compliments.", "It\u2019s really uncool of your wife be dragging other women. No matter how they look (which they can\u2019t really help), it doesn\u2019t mean she gets to rip on them. \n\nNTA.", "Info: why do you spend such a significant amount of time discussing exes? Not saying what she's doing is good, but talking about your past relationships enough to make this an issue seems weird.", "NTA, but it seems like this is a constant problem. She must be really insecure to be bringing up the situation all the time. Confused on how this happens to often", "NTA. She could easily just make a joke about being prettier and keep it stepping, but chose to be mean. She brings it up to make herself feel better, dragging you down in the process. You were being fresh, but not asshole enough to be left or ignored.", "NTA. But for a knock out that knows it your wife is hella insecure.", "I'm just confused with the frequency of these conversations about your exs? And how much focus you are making on an ex. \n\nMy husband and I aren't precious about bringing up past relationships, it's hard to talk about your life before your partner without a brief \"I travelled to Reykjavik with my Ex and this is the experience I had....\" or something similar. But even then, without the need to sensor (my brother's wife will not allow any mention of his ex's so he has to think carefully or sensor how he talks about past experiences), it doesn't happen that often. And also usually just a very brief \"I had this experience with an ex\" or \"my ex's family did this....\" The mention of the ex is usually an extremely small part of the actual discussion/conversation. \n\nSo, is this how your conversations are going, are you just mentioning them as a brief part of the bigger picture of what you're talking about and your wife is grabbing hold of that small section and running with it. Or are you having big  discussions about the people themselves? \n\nUnfortunately you wife is being insecure, I'm just trying to understand if the insecurity is rooted in the fact that you bring up ex's a lot or talk about them in depth, or if it's nothing to do with what you're doing and something she needs to work on herself.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA but a smartass ^^", "NTA. Play stupid games. Win stupid prizes. Good for you.", "NTA. Hilarious comeback though! Your wife sounds kinda insecure and childish. Dont talk shit about others to make yourself feel better, thats a bit toxic imo. And dont dish it if you cant take it.", "so, shes allowed to bash other women and say some pretty fucking nasty shit about people she doesnt even know so she feels better about herself but when you get sick of her never shutting the fuck about it (thats what i assume shes doing) SHES the one who gets offended. NTA\n\nalso OP, imma be honest, your wife does not sound like a nice person at all. seems like she lets her good looks go to her head and now she thinks shes better than other women.", "NTA. She can dish it but can\u2019t take it? She\u2019s projecting her insecurities onto those women, and in turn, onto you. I can\u2019t stand people who talk shit about others\u2019 looks & put them down for it - but I can\u2019t imagine being around someone who never shuts about it. Insufferable. Especially when it also reflects on and hurts you. Sorry OP. Sounds like she needed to hear that comment and maybe it will make her think twice before talking shit in the future, since you politely asking her to stop didn\u2019t work.", "esh, please stop talking ab your exs so often\n\nthat being said do you maybe compliment your wife often? maybe that\u2019s why she\u2019s insecure", "She is insecure and may have other serious mental issues. Please pay attention to her behavior, character and how she loves to pick fights. You may be ignoring red flags that are dangerous in relationships.

Genuine question, am I not allowed to talk about my experience in Malta (or wherever) because I was dating someone else at the time and they were traveling with me? The story will about some unique restaurant or bar or whatever, not about the person I was dating or traveling with, she is the one who then asks who I was with, were we dating, etc.", "Yeah that's shitty of her. So it sounds like it's something she needs to work through herself. There shouldn't be issues of bringing up an ex in that way, like I said it's difficult to talk about what you've done in your life without that brief mention of who was there. My husband has an ex wife, he was with her a long time, so she pops up now and again in conversation and it's no big deal, he had a life before me. Her looks don't make a difference to any of it. \n\nPersonally I would suggest that outside any of these conversations where she zeros in on an exs looks you bring it up to her and tell her it needs to stop, that it's insignificant in what you're talking about, that her doing that is her devaluing what you're actually trying to talk to her about and her making what could be a normal conversation into something thats unappealing and potentially causing arguments or issues within your relationship, it's unnecessary. Tell her you can't keep accepting it and if she continues to interrupt a conversation to bitch about someone's looks then that's her showing what she deems as important (basically her thoughts on looks are more important than what you're actually trying to have a conversation about) \n\nIn your post you mentioned you've told her how it's made you feel, what was her reaction to you telling her that??\n\nThen if she does this in the future after the talk, cut her off \"this isn't relevant to what I'm trying to tell you, can I continue what I was saying please?\" \n\nIf she doesn't stop and allow you to continue the conversation, simply \"we've talked about this, I'm sorry but I don't want to hear what you have to say\" and remove yourself. Harsh, but I think it will let her realise what she is doing.", "Yeah, maybe you need to have that checked \ud83e\udd28\ud83d\ude06", "It\u2019s always after some sort of funny story or a travel story that happened while with an ex and she starts going in on their looks", "I agree, been with my husband for 7 years and exes or past flings only come up naturally about once every 6 months or so - and that\u2019s only if we hear from or see them", "I'm inclined to agree. I've been with my boyfriend for over 4 years, and we don't really talk about our exes at all. There's just no point in it. We already know each other's past trauma from relationships, so it just isn't necessary.", "Hmm. Have you thought of just telling her that it doesn't matter who was accompanying you? If you travel a lot it would make sense that a lot of stories would involve places you've visited. Or simply tell her to stop asking questions about who went with you if she's simply going to sap all the fun out of the story. This is making me lean more in the NTA direction.", "ESH. Stop bringing up stories with your exes since they're such a sore spot for both of you. Your wife needs to work on her insecurities.", "Congratulations, Sherlock, you just cracked the case.\n\nStop talking about your exes, it's clearly tormenting your insecure wife.

It will be about a traveling somewhere and something serendipitous or funny happening.

She sounds very insecure and it's sad she feels the need to bash how other women look because she's jealous. I also think it's bizarre that you talk about your exes this much.

Spankings are cheaper.", "Perhaps your taste in women ran to qualities deeper than appearance before you were dazzzled by your wife's good looks.  \n\nPerhaps if your wife would stop bashing the appearance women with whom you've been involved, she might notice that some of them even had qualities she lacks.  Such as feeling secure enough about themselves that they didn't have to bash other women to make themselves feel better about themselves, and to make you feel worse about yourself.\n\nHow is it that a woman who isn't that nice to you is \"the best thing that ever happened to \\[you\\]?\" \n\nAnd, excuse me, but what happens if you have a daughter whose appearance is...God forbid!!!!...*average*?

If she wasn't your type, you likely wouldn't be with her. So, for every vile thing she says about your exes, she's saying them about herself too.

It also doesn't show you, or your wife, in the best light. Sure, not every ex is going to be a showstopper but there's absolutely zero need for you to look people up on FB purely for your wife to unload her vitriol.", "NTA. My husband and I used to do this bc objectively our exes are fugly. However, it was really hurting our feelings, so it just kinda stopped.

She needs to figure out how to love herself and trust your taste.", "NTA... LOL sorry but you gave her some real shit to think about :')", "NTA\nYour wife is doing a retrospective negging behaviour , criticising your exes or taste in women purely in her judgement  of their looks, when you see the person. She has an insecure mean streak in her to want to put others down\n\nBut You should avoid talking about women you feel are cute really though, as you know it riles your wife. You love her , you\u2019re happy together - and those  kind of conversations about other women in romantic or fancying terms have no  necessary part in your relationship. They are old news.

Especially personality disorders, which are notoriously difficult to diagnose.", "The problem isn't your history or your stories. It's that your wife 1) apparently really enjoys putting other people down, 2) looks for any reason to latch onto someone she can put down (probably in an attempt to lift herself up? Awful) and 3) your wife has no regard for your discomforts and reasonable boundaries. Like, how hard is it to just NOT be an asshole about other people's looks? ESPECIALLY when your husband has told you he doesn't like it and has asked you to stop? Yikes.", "Because telling his wife \"it doesn't matter who I was with\" isn't automatically going to trigger his wife thinking the worst. At the end of the day it doesn't matter what OP says, she is making him and herself miserable by giving priority to her insecurities rather than giving priority to his feelings or their relationship. And that sort of mindset is just toxic and selfish, and is unfair on OP, because all she is doing is punishing him for having a past. If he can't talk about a simple travel anecdote without her getting insecure, the problem is her, not OP. Her being so fixated on the past to the detriment of their present does nothing but feed more toxic thinking and behaviour. And everyone here trying to make OP somehow responsible for that is just as toxic.", "I agree with these comments that once a month discussing an ex or other women \u2018s looks (even if past women you mutually knew) that  you thought were pretty is far too often!

You definitely do not add the travelling partner detail for no reason. You talk about the incident, not who you were with and dont use 'we'. 'I' saw a man shitting himself at a bar in Paris, not 'we' saw a man shitting himself at a bar in Paris. You dont ever need to mention who you were there with. If she asks, ask why she needs to know as it's not important to the story. Discussions about your ex's should NOT be a monthly occurrence. I've been with my partner for more than 10 years, we've talked about ex's maybe 3 times. Having said that, she does sound very insecure, and therapy might be a good option for her."]}
