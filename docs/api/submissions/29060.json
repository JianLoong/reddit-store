{"id": 29060, "submission_id": "179e0ag", "title": "AITA for telling my husband to let the stepkids stay at boarding school?", "selftext": "I have been with my husband for 4 years (married for 1). He has 3 kids from his ex-wife. Admittedly he has a strained relationship with his kids because his ex-wife and he had a bitter divorce. She took the kids and left the country. There was a lot of parental alienation going on. The kids live in a boarding school in their home country, they visit their mum on the weekends and spend holidays with us. Kids are 16,15,12.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4 months ago their mom sadly passed away. Now my husband has full custody and he wants to move the kids back once this semester finishes. The kids don't want this as they are comfortable in their boarding school and have their maternal family there as well. They have gone so far as to ask their maternal grandparents to fight for custody (they don't have the means to do that.)My husband is still insistent, I told him he was being selfish. After losing their mum it's not a good idea to rip them away from their only other support system. That boarding school has been their home for most of their lives and to rip them away now would be cruel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI suggest taking this more slowly or even moving there to be near them. I work remotely and my husband can move his job. My husband is furious at me, accusing me of being an evil stepmom and hating the kids. He says he is rethinking our marriage. I don't know what to do. I want what's best for the kids. They live in Northern Europe and we live in the U.S., I hate the schools here, not to mention all their extended family is there. I just don't think they would react well to this change and it would only alienate them more. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I feel like I need to add this. The main reason my husband doesn't want to move back is his ex's family. My husband's parents and his ex (let's call her Laura) were best friends so my husband and Laura grew up together. They started dating at 19. At 20 my husband lost both his parents so Laura's family took him in and they supported him through university. When Laura got pregnant with their youngest she said she wanted to move to the U.S. so they did with the help of her family. When the youngest was 1 year old a man reached out to my husband claiming to be the possible father of the kid. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTurns out Laura had been having an affair for 2 years and the whole family knew. That's why they insisted on moving to the U.S. because Laura herself didn't know who the father was and the guy wanted a paternity test. Long story short a test was done, hubby was the father, she moved back (with the financial support of her family) and my husband was left alone in the U.S. Since then he has been NC with the whole family and bit his tongue for the sake of the kids but moving back would mean seeing them regularly. These were people he considered to be his second parents, Laura's siblings he considered his siblings.", "created_utc": 1697483565, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179e0ag/aita_for_telling_my_husband_to_let_the_stepkids/", "score": 504, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Those kids have suffered the loss of their mom and your husband wants to uproot them from everything they know and love in top of everything. That is very selfish on his part. I am sorry he carries trauma from his divorce, but he now has three orphans in his care and he has to do right by them. It is his responsability, and if that means play house with those who sided with his ex during the divorce, so be it. If it was a normal divorce, despite it being bitter, and nothing extreme involved (crime, putting the kids at risk, that kind of stuff) it is time for him to put his big boy pants and do what is best for his children, and not for him. Otherwise, it is you who should rethink your marriage with him. A man who is capable of knowingly doing dirty to his children this way only to do whatever he wants is not worth keeping.

You don't need to ask your maternal family to fight for you- I will continue to work with them to ensure they can visit, you stay in school, and all that.

If seeing His ex' Family is unbearably painful for him, He needs to get therapy to get over it. It's sad that you, the Stepmother of barely four years, is more interested in Putting the kids' needs First, than he is, but it's probably still possible to Change that.

How is offering to pick up and move to another country to be closer to them you being evil? Since he has threatened your marriage, I think you should hope for the best and prepare for the worst. He isn't thinking clearly and he wants to jump at the chance to finally be rid of the people that betrayed him and stole his kids. If he does bring the kids back against their will, they only have a few years before they can move back to their maternal family, if they want. But maybe that is something he needs to experience. He was totally screwed over by his ex and her family and now, his kids are rejecting him. He needs to put his anger somewhere, so he's aiming it at you. And you don't deserve that. Personally, I would get my affairs in order and secure my finances, because that threat was unacceptable and you may need to act. I'm sorry he doesn't know much to deal with his feelings better than hurting the person who stands by him.", "NTA just in terms of schooling the kids shouldn't be moved, certainly not against their will.\n\nIt is a difficult situation.", "Honestly, the 15 & 16 yo are old enough to have a say in what they want and separating the youngest would be cruel.\n\nMoving there at least for the short term seems the kindest way to approach things.

How dare he accuse you, when you even suggested moving to a different country to be near them?\n\nI don't care what his issues are, that was an asshole move and he needs to apologize to you.", "One important thing is to not screw up their education. The two eldest are most probably heading towards major exam time, moving them to different schools could mean them having to learn a completely different syllabus if the new school doesn't use the same examination board, that could sabotage all of their work over the past couple of years. If your husband can't understand this part alone he's thoroughly selfish.", "NTA  \nOK, now it makes a bit more sense.  \nStill, you are 100% right, tearing the kids away from everything they know right now is wrong. They need their support support system and the family they know.

Your husband is being selfish. He wants to uproot their entire lives.\n\nBest thing for them is to stay in boarding school with their friends and near their maternal relatives.", "He needs to go see his children and have a heart to heart. If they are doing well and happy in the boarding school ( besides losing their mom of course) then he needs to consider them, not himself. If he divorces you over this, well then he\u2019s a double dolt. You aren\u2019t evil, you\u2019re willing to move closer and are respecting their wishes, as he\u2019s just trying to control everyone. They need to have their say. What they want matters, not your husband or you.", "NTA. You are putting the needs of the kids first. \nIt sounds like the kindest solution would he to agree to shared custody with the grandparents, so the children can stay in the school that they feel safe in, and have adult guardians nearby that they can turn to. The kids can still come visit during holidays, and can be told that they are welcome to stay longer or move in at any point if they wish to do so. \nI understand that your husband is deeply traumatised by what happened, but the important thing now is to act in the best interests of his kids.  Ripping them away from every link to their Mum, their friends, and support network, would likely permanently damage their relationship with their Dad. \nI recommend he and the grandparents have family therapy to discuss what happened and try to find a way to co-parent the children. \nYou are NTA for stepping up as a neutral party advocating for the children.", "YTA.

FWIW, this is about the only time left he has to seal a bond with his kids before they're old enough to just leave him high and dry. Moving there so the kids can stay in boarding school would still mean a wedge driven by his ex's family and very little bonding time, considering the kids would still spend a great deal of time in boarding school. \n\nI vote mild YTA, because they're his kids and he really is trying to do what's best for his family.", ">Your husband is being selfish\n\nas much as it hurts me I agree.

From what you said, it looks like the children only spent about two years in the US, 10 years ago, before returning to their native country.

I don't see how, even if your husband officially has custody, he could force the children to emigrate if they don't want to go.

It does come off as a power play though, a bit of revenge on her family by bringing the kids to the US, especially since they supported her leaving him there. \n\nIt doesn't change the fact though, that ripping them away from their support system when their mother just died is extremely cruel. Especially with him losing his parents at such an early age as well, I would hope he could have some empathy regarding this. I suppose he was in a different life stage if they passed when he was 20. But if he wishes to be closer to the kids, he's just going to have to put on his big boy pants and move back. That doesn't mean he has to interact with his ex's family though. I've seen enough small town grudges to know you do not have to interact if you don't want to.\n\nIs moving to a different town near the boarding school a possibility? I'm assuming as the kids are boarding many of them are not locals, so perhaps a town further down on the train line? Perhaps instead of selling your house in the US you could just rent it out (or close it up) for a few years until they've graduated?
