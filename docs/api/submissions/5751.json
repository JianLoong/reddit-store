Even though we are happily in love, the wedding was a complete disaster.\n\nSince I lost over half of my bridal party (due to covid), I asked my fianc\u00e9s cousin to be in my bridal party only a week before the wedding. Let's call her Linda (31 F). Luckily, she was a similar size dress to one of my friends that dropped out.\n\nHowever, Linda has always been very protective of her cousin (my fianc\u00e9), but in a very weird way. She would invite all of the family couples over for drinks at her house, excluding me. So she would just invite my fianc\u00e9 and the two of them would be a pair since she is single. The first time this happened, I was sick, so we didn't think that much about her not inviting me but then she only invited him again, and he respectfully declined. She invited him twice more after this.\n\nThe wedding venue was located at a beautiful barn that was close to my parent's house. All the people in the wedding party were invited to stay overnight at my parent's house so we wouldn't have to travel the day of. That night she snuck out claiming she needed to get last-minute things for the wedding. Little did we know she walked to the barn and started her sabotage.\n\nThe next morning I got all dressed in my beautiful dress and did my hair and makeup with my bridesmaids. Linda was nowhere to be seen. Thinking this was her trying to get attention we ignored it and continued having a fabulous morning.\n\nMy mom had gone out earlier to put the finishing touches on the wedding venue. She called me as soon as she got there and saw the damage\n\nAll of the vases that had flowers specifically picked from my mother's garden had been smashed\n\nThe water from the vases leaked onto the floor, ruining them\n\nThe tablecloths had been cut and multiple chairs were knocked over\n\nThere was a beautiful archway, covered in flowers, that we were supposed to be married under. It had been torn to pieces.\n\nWhen I first heard the news, I had no idea what to do first. We only had 45 minutes until the wedding started and guests would arrive soon. We ended up just having to sweep up as much glass and flowers as possible and throw it all away. The arch was unsalvageable and we had to get plastic tablecloths from my mother's attic to replace the cloth ones she had handmade.\n\n2 weeks later, in a typical Linda drunken state, she confessed that she had been the one to destroy my wedding. I am refusing to speak to her.\n\nMy Fianc\u00e9's family has been pushing me to forgive her and says that she only reacted that way because she is very protective over her cousin and doesn't think I'm good enough for him. My Fianc\u00e9 has taken my side and now the family is split.\n\nIt's possible that I have overreacted but I'm not sure.

He should let his cousin know that from that point forward, you are a family unit. If ahe doesn't invite you to something and treat you fairly, neither of you are going.

I think, unless you left out information about her repaying you, you are **UNDER** reacting. \n\n Also, I noticed that nowhere in your post does it say that Linda apologized. It says she confessed to destroying your wedding, but it says nothing about her apologizing for doing so.  And why is your husband\u2019s family so keen to sweep all this under the rug?
