Even though we are happily in love, the wedding was a complete disaster.\n\nSince I lost over half of my bridal party (due to covid), I asked my fianc\u00e9s cousin to be in my bridal party only a week before the wedding. Let's call her Linda (31 F). Luckily, she was a similar size dress to one of my friends that dropped out.\n\nHowever, Linda has always been very protective of her cousin (my fianc\u00e9), but in a very weird way. She would invite all of the family couples over for drinks at her house, excluding me. So she would just invite my fianc\u00e9 and the two of them would be a pair since she is single. The first time this happened, I was sick, so we didn't think that much about her not inviting me but then she only invited him again, and he respectfully declined. She invited him twice more after this.\n\nThe wedding venue was located at a beautiful barn that was close to my parent's house. All the people in the wedding party were invited to stay overnight at my parent's house so we wouldn't have to travel the day of. That night she snuck out claiming she needed to get last-minute things for the wedding. Little did we know she walked to the barn and started her sabotage.\n\nThe next morning I got all dressed in my beautiful dress and did my hair and makeup with my bridesmaids. Linda was nowhere to be seen. Thinking this was her trying to get attention we ignored it and continued having a fabulous morning.\n\nMy mom had gone out earlier to put the finishing touches on the wedding venue. She called me as soon as she got there and saw the damage\n\nAll of the vases that had flowers specifically picked from my mother's garden had been smashed\n\nThe water from the vases leaked onto the floor, ruining them\n\nThe tablecloths had been cut and multiple chairs were knocked over\n\nThere was a beautiful archway, covered in flowers, that we were supposed to be married under. It had been torn to pieces.\n\nWhen I first heard the news, I had no idea what to do first. We only had 45 minutes until the wedding started and guests would arrive soon. We ended up just having to sweep up as much glass and flowers as possible and throw it all away. The arch was unsalvageable and we had to get plastic tablecloths from my mother's attic to replace the cloth ones she had handmade.\n\n2 weeks later, in a typical Linda drunken state, she confessed that she had been the one to destroy my wedding. I am refusing to speak to her.\n\nMy Fianc\u00e9's family has been pushing me to forgive her and says that she only reacted that way because she is very protective over her cousin and doesn't think I'm good enough for him. My Fianc\u00e9 has taken my side and now the family is split.\n\nIt's possible that I have overreacted but I'm not sure.

Tbh if it were me I'd wonder a lot of there was more to the story between them.", "INFO\n\nWhy would you invite somebody, who has socially excluded you so obviously, to be part of your bridal party?

She should be sued for everything.", "She's a danger potentially to kids or pets, as well as OP herself.  No way she gets to be around after destroying someone's wedding.", "Oh yeah, sue her", "I was looking thru the comments for someone who was thinking the same as me.  Cousin or not, I'm seeing jealous woman/woman scorned vibes here.

Put down the incest porn, it's frying your brain.", "Are you high?", "I mean forgiveness could just mean not calling the police if she\u2019s seen in their street. Then I think it\u2019s an option to consider after she\u2018s gone through therapy.", "NTA, but you might wanna look in to sue her, and having her either pay for all the damages,  OR, go on the record in a public apology and be open about it.", "There was a story on here about the cousin died in an accident and the husband went off the deep end and then confessed to wife that they had been carrying on an affair since they were teenagers. I wish the best for OP but she really should press charges and so should the venue. Then her and her husband should get a restraining order. Anyone who complains can cough up the money for a NEW WEDDING!!!\n\nNTA", "NTA.  She is lucky you or your mother did not press charges against her or sue for damages.

Never talk to this lunatic again.", "NTA\n\nI honestly would have called the police and filed charges, this is craziness", "NTA and sue her for damages. Did anyone take photos? Anyone have her confession on tape/written out? \n\nThis woman is dangerous enough to be violent. Maybe she didn\u2019t hurt someone physically, but she wrecked an entire wedding out of a tantrum. \n\nIf you ever buy a house together, she will damage it somehow. \n\nIf you ever have children, she will break the crib and wreck the room. \n\nCut her off but don\u2019t let this slide.

I hope your husband goes NC with her as well. It's appalling that other family members are excusing her actions. Whatever her reasons were, it's unforgivable.

Fianc\u00e9 needs to make a big statement to his family about this and to say that what his cousin did was not understandable in any way and that he (stress this as his decision) has made the decision to file legal charges as well as to pursue a restraining order of protection for both of you.  Then also file a civil suit to recoup the value loss of the destruction she caused.", "NTA ask your husbands family why they\u2019re okay with his cousin having a crush on him", "NTA- she's incredibly possessive of your partner in an unhealthy, psychopathic way.

That would probably not help family reconciliation but yeah, that is not a ok.", "NTA. Call the police. This is unacceptable behavior I don\u2019t care how protective of her cousin she is. This is unhinged and insane. I would cut off anyone who says this is not a big deal.", "NTA - is this in Kentucky? I\u2019ve heard about the cousin lovin there and this reeks of it. Be careful OP - I think she\u2019s in love with your fianc\u00e9 and mad at you about it.", "NTA Linda is a psycho who is in love with her cousin", "NTA.\nNope. That\u2019s not it at all. Her protectiveness is out of control. Not to mention, you should let it slide because she thinks you\u2019re not good enough for him??? THAT\u2019S why you should FORGIVE her?

That is just about the shittiest thing anyone could ever do. And have. you really not worked out that this isn't about her being 'protective' of your husband but being obsessively in love with him. Your fiance's family are utter AHs for expecting you to forgive him on the flimsy grounds they cite. I give him little credit, btw, for doing the right thing now. There are some things that cannot and should not be forgiven.", "NTA", "Surely this is criminal damage?

There's more going on here than OP realizes imo. I'm glad her husband has her back since his family doesn't want to admit how awful the cousin is. Suing her might snap some sense into her, but I doubt it. Still, I'm getting an icky vibe from this if it's real.", "You underreacted, she ruined your wedding on purpose.
