Even though we are happily in love, the wedding was a complete disaster.\n\nSince I lost over half of my bridal party (due to covid), I asked my fianc\u00e9s cousin to be in my bridal party only a week before the wedding. Let's call her Linda (31 F). Luckily, she was a similar size dress to one of my friends that dropped out.\n\nHowever, Linda has always been very protective of her cousin (my fianc\u00e9), but in a very weird way. She would invite all of the family couples over for drinks at her house, excluding me. So she would just invite my fianc\u00e9 and the two of them would be a pair since she is single. The first time this happened, I was sick, so we didn't think that much about her not inviting me but then she only invited him again, and he respectfully declined. She invited him twice more after this.\n\nThe wedding venue was located at a beautiful barn that was close to my parent's house. All the people in the wedding party were invited to stay overnight at my parent's house so we wouldn't have to travel the day of. That night she snuck out claiming she needed to get last-minute things for the wedding. Little did we know she walked to the barn and started her sabotage.\n\nThe next morning I got all dressed in my beautiful dress and did my hair and makeup with my bridesmaids. Linda was nowhere to be seen. Thinking this was her trying to get attention we ignored it and continued having a fabulous morning.\n\nMy mom had gone out earlier to put the finishing touches on the wedding venue. She called me as soon as she got there and saw the damage\n\nAll of the vases that had flowers specifically picked from my mother's garden had been smashed\n\nThe water from the vases leaked onto the floor, ruining them\n\nThe tablecloths had been cut and multiple chairs were knocked over\n\nThere was a beautiful archway, covered in flowers, that we were supposed to be married under. It had been torn to pieces.\n\nWhen I first heard the news, I had no idea what to do first. We only had 45 minutes until the wedding started and guests would arrive soon. We ended up just having to sweep up as much glass and flowers as possible and throw it all away. The arch was unsalvageable and we had to get plastic tablecloths from my mother's attic to replace the cloth ones she had handmade.\n\n2 weeks later, in a typical Linda drunken state, she confessed that she had been the one to destroy my wedding. I am refusing to speak to her.\n\nMy Fianc\u00e9's family has been pushing me to forgive her and says that she only reacted that way because she is very protective over her cousin and doesn't think I'm good enough for him. My Fianc\u00e9 has taken my side and now the family is split.\n\nIt's possible that I have overreacted but I'm not sure.

She will try to destroy your marriage. You absolutely need to avoid this woman.", "Ummm there is a reason she would do something like that and it's not that she's \"overprotective....\" Bizarre to me that there aren't more details about your fiancee's (now husband?) reaction and explanation to his cousin behaving this way for so long. Tbh if it were me I'd wonder a lot of there was more to the story between them.", "Info\n\nWhy would you invite somebody, who has socially excluded you so obviously, to be part of your bridal party? How big was your bridal party before you had the withdrawals?", "NTA. You can and should sue her for damages.", "NTA \n\nshe isn\u2019t \u201cprotective\u201d of her cousin, she\u2019s IN LOVE with her cousin. This is so creepy and weird", "Exactly. She should be sued for everything.", "She's a danger potentially to kids or pets, as well as OP herself.  No way she gets to be around after destroying someone's wedding.", "Oh yeah, sue her", "I was looking thru the comments for someone who was thinking the same as me.  Cousin or not, I'm seeing jealous woman/woman scorned vibes here.  Linda wants the groom for herself.", "Yep. Willing to bet that at some point in their lives OP's now-husband and cousin had sex. When OP moved into the serious zone the cousin began her sabotage schemes.", "Yep you need to make a FU binder, see r/justnomil it  will  be  very  useful  to  have  it  all  documented when  she  pulls  the  next  stunt", "I love your brain. I screenshot your comment to have on hand, it\u2019s perfect \ud83e\udd70", ">>that night she snuck out claiming she needed to get last-minute things for the wedding.\n\nIt was the middle of the night.  Aka a B&E.  The venue would have no liability", "Wow. I've never thought too much of the comments that make wild leaps, but this one is deranged. Put down the incest porn, it's frying your brain.", "Are you high?", "I mean forgiveness could just mean not calling the police if she\u2019s seen in their street. Then I think it\u2019s an option to consider after she\u2018s gone through therapy."]}
