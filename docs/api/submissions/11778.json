I definitely don't agree with everything but I can see both sides. \n\nFirst I do want to clear up some stuff. I'm not sure why so many people act like I sprung it on Amanda. I never said I did, and I certainly didnt. I told her upfront about Ruby and was clear that I expected a partner to be willing to put in the effort for her sake. Also I never criticised Amanda for not being fluent. I had no expectation it would be easy or quick, hell I struggled at first. I've never insulted her or had issues with her progress. My only issue was that she refused to try anymore. While my words were immature, it was only after she basically said it wasn't worth learning sign language that I got upset and said it.\n\nI find the idea it's too soon honestly strange. Wouldn't it be worse for us to be engaged or married before I know if she's willing to put in the effort for my daughter? I don't expect perfection, just for her to try. I understand that Ruby needs to be able to communicate in other ways. She has to for school. But that doesn't mean she should be forced to at home. Besides all this I did consider our relationship serious, I love Amanda.\n\nWith that aside, I think it's mostly been resolved. Amanda came over and apologised for how she acted. She explained that she had been trying to hide how much she was struggling, and got frustrated seeing how quickly Mia was getting it while she understood nothing. Basically Amanda was seeing how quickly and 'effortlessly' I was getting close to Mia, and was feeling like she was useless with her lack of progress, especially knowing how important it was to me. We had a long talk about it. I apologised for my immature reaction and explained that it was always non-negotiable for me. And I brought up that if it would make her miserable and resentful it may be better to separate. Amanda did not like that and we talked about our relationship and expectations. I considered it serious the moment she met Ruby. While Amanda didn't see it quite the same way, she knew she wanted me in her life and understood that meant she had to try with Ruby.\n\nAmanda has decided to find her own professional teaching. She thinks it will be better for her frustration to show there than with Ruby or I. I'll keep teaching Mia, because she really enjoys it. It doesn't matter whether she is fluent, as long as she's trying. I know Ruby will appreciate the effort. For now Ruby will still have to use other methods to communicate (she was anyway), but hopefully one day she won't have to.\n\nUnfortunately my brother stands by what he says. He said that even though Amanda has 'given in', it was still unfair of me. That I'm 'lucky' Amanda is willing to put up with it. I've honestly lost a lot of respect for him with all this. I don't understand how he can think that about Ruby and I.\n\nStill, overall I'd say it's gone well. Thanks for the advice, whichever way you lent. I think we'll be able to get through it.", "created_utc": 1678279015, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11lva8c/update_aita_for_calling_my_girlfriend_selfish_for/", "score": 2370, "replies": ["Your brother said \"Amanda puts up with it\" that hit me the wrong way...", "Interesting Dilema. I get where you are coming from and where your partner  is coming from. It sounds like you resolved it.

Your brother sounds like he isn\u2019t who you thought he was and I am sorry for that. Has happened to me too with people. I sure hope it works out. We all have a more difficult language, any language, the older we get. I am glad it is working out!\ud83d\ude0a", "Kids pick up languages in whatever form, just easier than grown ups.

There should be an interpreter if she needs it. \n\nIn any case let your gf know that it's always going to be easier for a younger kid to learn something than it is for her..but sign language works best for adults when they learn in a physical classroom over online. Look into your local community College or Deaf community to see if there are classes.", "I'm glad she's still gonna try learning. Some people on the last post were total asshats, thing you it's unreasonable and that a lot of people don't know sign language so your daughter should have to adjust instead, like yeah expecting every stranger to know it is unreasonable but your gf would literally live in the same house as her why the fuck would it be unreasonable to expect her to learn sign language", ">Amanda has decided to find her own professional teaching\n\nCheck your local library system; if you have a medium-or-larger Deaf community in your area, you can often get free group classes at the library.  Also adults learn languages differently than children do, so it's totally normal that Mia is picking up ASL faster than Amanda.  But an organized class (whether it be lead by an official teacher, an interpreter, or a Deaf person who is a good teacher doesn't matter) is probably going to be better and less frustrating than DIY lessons. ASL is really hard until you un-learn a lot of the rules of English grammar, adults often under-estimate that, and it can be reeeeally frustrating at first.\n\nAlso I'd stick to mastering fingerspelling and the W-words (who, what, where etc) for now and not worry too much about vocabulary. So many of the signs are a combination of a letter you'd use if you fingerspelled that word plus an action of what that word looks like that if you get the fingerspelling down, you've got half the vocabulary done.", "Your brother sounds like the asshole here", "I need to know who Mia is, what her correlation to this is, and how she has anything to do with Amanda's ability to sign. I'm so nosey I want all the details no one thought to ask about.", "That's good. Glad Amanda admitted it and accepted to improve", "I would have lost a lot of respect for my brother too if I had the same happen to me\n\nI wish you the best!", ">Amanda has decided to find her own professional teaching. \n\nThis is a great idea.", "I didn\u2019t see the first post (so went back and read it). My heart broke for you guys. I see myself in that situation and all I can think is...I\u2019d do anything to be able to communicate with my partner\u2019s child.", "Glad Amanda and you are seeing eye to eye again. I can really understand where she's coming from. I really hope you'll be able to move forward in a constructive way!", "NTA, the right one will be invested in your kid because they want to be.", "Honestly, *as someone who speaks a different native language from my partner,* I feel that it's probably better NOT to add the role of language teacher to that of partner. It can be really hard to change languages and it can also place pretty heavy expectations on both roles (as \"student\" and as \"teacher\").\n\nI've also found it very hard to switch languages with friends when I \"met\" them thro' my partner's language and **I am a professional teacher of my native language**.\n\nI think it's best for Amanda to have \"proper\" classes with formal input and then have the opportunity to chat and practice ASL in a fun and safe environment. Playing with kids can be really helpful in learning another language.\n\nBest of luck to OP and Amanda.", "I\u2019m glad to hear that your girlfriend is making an effort to learn sign language! Ruby is your child. In a serious relationship where there\u2019s a kid involved (especially a child with a disability) I think it absolutely fair to expect there to be some effort on your SO\u2019s part to learn how to accommodate them. \n\nIt isn\u2019t fair to expect every partner you have to do so\u2014some people just don\u2019t want that out of a relationship, so I can understand to a degree perhaps what your brother was saying if (and ONLY IF) he isn\u2019t completely aware of how serious your relationship is, and perhaps this is something to communicate to him. He is Ruby\u2019s uncle, and he should be more aware of how this could impact her when considering a long-term relationship with someone (and honestly, how that statement in itself could impact her). That being said, all that matters is that you and your girlfriend are on the same page. No one will ever know your relationship better than the two of you. \n\nYou and your girlfriend clearly love each other and clearly value each other\u2019s presence in your lives\u2014I think that\u2019s wonderful! Happy to see that everything is going well for you three. I wish you guys the best!", "NAH\n\nIt's understandable you want this for your daughter, but asking someone to learn a language like this is a bit much. Not everyone in your daughter's life is going to accommodate her, and you shouldn't expect them to.\n\nEven talking about your brother - he may be a tiny bit of an AH, but he has a right to his opinion, and it's not like his opinion is unreasonable.", "Yta. Marshmallow parenting.", "What do you mean? Like about him? Or something up with me?", "[removed]", "I know that. I was originally frustrated myself. But as long as she's trying that's enough. Ruby will understand and appreciate the effort. She sees that with how willing some friends are to try and learn some.", "Thanks, I'm sorry you've had that. It honestly makes no sense to me that he sees it this way. And I'm definitely glad it's working too!", "How do I do that? I'll try to figure it out", "From what I understand she can effectively communicate without an interpreter. She's allowed her phone, unlike her peers. So she manages fine even if she prefers to sign.\n\nI'm not an expert, like I've said in another comment. She used to have one, but not anymore.", "I think she technically could. But from what the school has said this works better in terms of her learning. Since she can understand and will need the skills in her life and whatnot. I'm not an education expert admittedly, so maybe I took their word too quick. \n\nFor the rest, will do. That makes sense.", "She could have an interpreter but realistically having no other way to communicate is going to cause some social issues as she\u2019d have to have an adult following her", "Oh sorry if it's not clear. She's Amanda's daughter. She's been really excited about signing and learning surprisingly fast. She's still very very basic, but can kinda talk to Ruby.", "Some people don't want to, sure. Then I won't date them. \n\nIt's not reasonable to expect everyone to want a child. But no one would say expecting your partner who knew dated you knowing you wanted a child, to want a child, is unreasonable. \n\nSure normally it wouldn't need to be an expectation. But here it is. And I'm open about it. Im not 'lucky', a partner dating you with known expectations is the minimum. If things change, then the relationship is likely to end to. Same here.\n\nEither way, thanks for your kind words. I definitely love Amanda. She's an amazing woman. I definitely think it'll go great.", "Not everyone is gonna accommodate but if she expects to be part of her life she better learn it to some degree.", "I disagree, OP isn't asking everyone in his friends/family to learn ASL. I think if it's a serious relationship and Amanda is potentially going to be Ruby's stepmother in the future, then it's totally reasonable to want your partner to be able to fully communicate with your child.\n\nSome people in OPs shoes might not expect that, but at the end of the day OPs priority should be the child and making sure her needs are being met", "I get it's not a normal request. But for my daughter I disagree it's unreasonable. If it's wrong Amanda has had every opportunity to leave. She knew my expectations. If you date me knowing what I require in a partner, then hell yes I can expect that.\n\nAnd his opinion isn't reasonable. I'm not 'coddling' Ruby with this. And I'm lucky my partner stayed with me when I wanted to uphold my expectations she knew about from the start? That's the minimum.", "What's that mean? I'm guessing it's something about being too soft. If so how the hell?", "What he said sounds like your daughter is a burden. I'd seriously consider breaking up with HIM", "With his it sounds like he  insinuated  that she's a burden.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11f5c7d/aita_calling_my_girlfriend_selfish_for_refusing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf", "Does she use proper sign language or when she signs are there some mixed in that she and you have altered to make your own? The only way an interpreter would not be in her best interest is if they had trouble communicating what she was saying to the teacher.", "I think this is something worth pushing back on.  Ruby doesn\u2019t have the opportunity to participate equally or fully express herself all day at school - she has to use a slow, awkward, annoying mode of communication that keeps her from being able to interact evenly with her teachers and her peers.  It reduces her ability to ask questions, especially complex ones.  Not having an interpreter is cheaper and more convenient for the school, so most schools will resist even though it meant putting disabled kids at a major disadvantage.", "The interpreter would be for the teachers to understand Ruby's signing. I'd push this issue, as she may be legally entitled to an interpreter. Sometimes schools give reasons that sound appealing to parents to cover up their attempts to simply save money by denying money, and unfortunately disabled students are often the targets of this.", "Honestly the school should provide an interpreter AND instruction to the teacher and the other kids on how to sign. Likely that's all done by the same person, but the focus shouldn't only be how to make class more accessible to Ruby but how to make the *community* more accessible to everyone.", "Oh, I completely agree with you! Honestly, I just don\u2019t want to make any harsh statements about your brother\u2014there\u2019s only so much we can get from a single anonymous post, and I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. But, I completely understand why his comments are so frustrating! I think anyone in your position would be taken aback. I hope you guys can come to a resolution!", "As I said, both of you have understandable positions. And you dealt with this in a mature way, with good communication. Thus, NAH\n\n>*And I'm lucky my partner stayed with me when I wanted to uphold my expectations she knew about from the start?*\n\nYeah, but she's still doing it, even when it's not easy. It is something you should appreciate, I think. Don't take it for granted.", "Don\u2019t worry OP, your expectation that your partner learns sign language is not unreasonable. Some people are just lazy gits. \n\nDid your brother ever learn btw? I would, if it was my niece. If he hasn\u2019t, maybe he feels it reflects badly on him if your partner learns and he doesn\u2019t? Hence the whole \u2018she gave in\u2019 and \u2018you\u2019re lucky but she really shouldn\u2019t have to\u2019 talk", "Excuse me? Ruby is not a burden. Whatever my old in-laws think she's an amazing girl. Sure I had to learn sign language but she's not a burden to me.\n\nEdit. They changed their comment. It wasn't as clear they meant my brother originally", "He did.", "Thanks!", "It's proper to my knowledge. We did get proper training, and I had a nanny that specifically knew sign language cause I didn't at first. I think it's more how sometimes words can have slightly different meanings. Or she was just iverexcitment and missioned possibly.", "Really? They made it sound like this was the better, less disruptive option. I know Ruby dislikes her phone of course. But the school basically said it would be better and easier for her to communicate more directly this way. That the phone was the accomadation.\n\nI didn't realise it would be so damaging. Ruby's a bright girl and generally gets Bs, so I didn't really think anything was wrong academically.", "Also, consider it this way: your daughter spends at least 6 hours a day at school. No one probably knows how to sign or they don't know a lot. That means she has to choose between saying things in a way no one understands, typing on her phone, or saying nothing. How often do you think she is not saying anything just because it takes so long the moment has passed (conversations with peers, group discussions in class) or is just inconvenient or doesn't feel \"worth it\"? Even if Ruby doesn't complain, this is a problem. It sounds very isolating.", "I mean, I guess. He is kinda friends with her (they were coworkers when I met her, unrelated coincidence). So maybe that could change his perspective. But it's about Ruby, his niece. I can't really see a good reason to say it. Maybe it was just poorly expressed but I'm definitely not happy with him.", "I do appreciate her effort. But saying I'm 'lucky', is like saying you're lucky a partner doesn't cheat despite temptation, it was a base expectation in the relationship. I didn't hide it from her.", "He actually does now the basics. No where near fluent but can talk to Ruby mostly. Naturally he taught her the swear words though of course. It's possible that has to do with it maybe. Or at least thinking I'm lucky he did.", "I meant that's what he makes it sounds like which is why you should get rid if him. I edited my comment to make it clearer", "It's easier and cheaper for the school but if you pushed they would have to let it happen. Lots of schools say the same to Deaf children and it's so wrong. I would suggest talking with Ruby and see how she feels? If a child requires an interpreter Deaf or not the ADA says the school needs to provide one. Even in the future when she is older and on her own there are laws to allow for her to have an interpreter.", "They\u2019re dead wrong.  Being able to communicate freely like any other student is important both academically and developmentally.  They\u2019re demanding Ruby take a relatively passive role in the classroom instead of being able to participate more actively.  It\u2019s easier *for them*, because they won\u2019t have to hire and schedule an interpreter.  It\u2019s less disruptive *for them* because it means one student who is less able to interact with everyone else.  Having an interpreter in the classroom requires virtually no adjustment for the teacher, and no change to the lessons or schedule.  It\u2019ll mean more paperwork for the school administration, and a minor change to the classroom seating, and that\u2019s it.  The class will likely have a week or two of students acting out a bit because there\u2019s a change, but that only happens when the interpreter is first introduced, and it quickly fades.\n\nIf anything, having an interpreter should be less disruptive, because Ruby will be able to communicate so much faster!  The teacher won\u2019t have to wait while she painstakingly taps out her question on her phone.  Being interpreted is slightly slower than speaking for oneself, but so much faster than a kid typing on a phone.\n\nI used to sign (though I\u2019ve forgotten so much I can\u2019t honestly say I do now), and I\u2019ve had Deaf classmates in college and law school.  Once the seating arrangements were settled, that was the end of any kind of inconvenience or disruption to the class.", "My wife worked as a special needs advocate and it is not uncommon for schools to try to lead parents into solutions that work best for them but not necessarily the best for the child. It wouldn't hurt to get a second opinion.", "Whilst an interpreter is probably easiest for in class making sure ruby is able to communicate with her peers without an adult present is definitely important", "Not to mention that she might not be able to ask for clarification when she doesn't understand something she's being taught as all kids occasionally need to do, because while she can communicate, she can't communicate quickly or easily. She's mostly getting Bs but her grades might improve with an interpreter available to her. Either way though, it's best for the OP to sit down with Ruby and ask her how she feels about the situation and if she wants an interpreter.", "Totally understandable! What he said seems to have zero empathy for both you and your child; growing up with a disability can already be hard enough, so seeing your brother not double down on something that would support her is definitely grounds to not be happy with him. Hopefully, he can see why that perspective is harmful!", "Oh ok, that makes more sense. My old in laws saw her as basically a defect so I'm sensitive to that kind of thing. I definitely misunderstood", "I'll do that then. I just honestly believed them, and since Ruby's been doing well I thought it was fine. She complains about the phone, but she complained about the interpreter (if she was slow, didn't understand her, etc), so I didn't really think it meant this. Thanks for your advice.", "\n\nThat makes sense. I don't think she's passive, at least from parent-teacher conferences. But I can definitely understand the differnce. I'll look into it. I don't want Ruby to be disadvantaged.", "[removed]", "If I was you I'd react the same.\n\nAnd I just want to quote something an acquaintance recently said to me. Due to neurological issues and CPTSD I can't communicate anymore the same way as I did when I was healthy. Sometimes I forget things I have been told, sometimes I'm overwhelmed or too ill to write and need a break from all communication / can only answer really important stuff and some ways of communication like long voice messages don't work for me at all. That cost me several friends, including pretty close ones. And I lost my best friend because she turned out ableist and told me invisible disabilities don't exist. A few days ago I apologised to an acquaintance (who doesn't seem to mind even month long gaps in my answers) because I asked her something she had told me about a year ago. Her answer was telling me not to apologize and that it's a wonder I don't forget more (my memory is affected, as well as my cognitive abilities, I often feel as if I became stupid because I can't do things anymore like I did in the past, for example I went from being able to calculate things faster in my head than others could put them into a calculator to needing a calculator for pretty easy things) and not to feel bad. I told her what I wrote before about friendships and she said: \"Whoever thinks like this is not worth to be in your life.\" And that's important, especially for your daughter. An uncle who calls her a burden is not only a danger that needs to be removed to protect her from developing self-worth issues but also not worth the effort it takes her to write out what she wants to say to him, even if it's a well deserved \"f*** you.\" You and your daughter don't need such people.", "I wanted to add that your brother isn't just saying your daughter is a burden and not worth any effort being made for, he is also saying YOU are not worth it either.\n\nDoes your brother do any sign language? Defending Amanda might be him subconsciously trying to make excuses for himself. No praise for her being able to accept some fault, be vulnerable about insecurities, and make new plans to tackle something that was a struggle? People make mistakes, how they react to their mistakes is what's important. He didn't even make it and is on the being shitty side. It sounds like he's resentful that she self reflected and then choose to do the hard thing for someone she loves, so now he has to use dismissive language to imply this is not normal and so you shouldn't be happy about your partner agreeing to try for you.", "The part that stood out to me is the part about the seriousness of the relationship. \n\n\nYou stated you take the relationship seriously and more so by meeting your daughter then you said, her not so.much. \n\n\nWhat's the late part mean.", "Just an FYI schools will always lie to save money. My daughter has an IEP and getting them to provide what is legally mandated is like pulling teeth. But yes, Ruby is legally entitled to an interpreter if she wants one.", ">since Ruby's been doing well I thought it was fine.\n\nI'm a sign language interpreter and I have worked with many, *many* Deaf people who went through the school system in my country (UK) without appropriate communication support, seemingly doing well. What they were actually doing was nodding along with the teacher, not taking much in, and then self-teaching in order to keep up with their peers. Not only were they absolutely exhausted, they were also incredibly isolated socially.\n\nI'm not saying that this is what is happening with your daughter, but I am saying that schools choosing the cheapest, easiest option and insisting that it's working is something that happens all the time. So just be aware of that.\n\n>she complained about the interpreter (if she was slow, didn't understand her, etc)\n\nIt's hard to know with this whether the interpreter was completely useless or if, because your daughter is unused to working with interpreters, she expects perfection at all times and lacks patience. Only by being exposed to interpreters will she learn how to utilise us and forgive the occasional blip - because they do happen.\n\n>But from what the school has said this works better in terms of her learning. Since she can understand and will need the skills in her life and whatnot.\n\nShe also needs to be given choices over how she accesses her learning and, as I said above, be given opportunities to learn how to work with interpreters for her future. Empowering her in this way means she will be far more knowledgable about exactly what she needs when she leaves school and enters the workforce, where she will have to advocate for herself.\n\nEDIT:\n\nJust noticed this from one of your comments:\n\n>They made it sound like this was the better, less disruptive option\n\nMuch like a blind person's cane or a wheelchair user's chair, a Deaf person's interpreter should *never* be considered disruptive and it worries me that the school seems to think this. It leaves me feeling suspicious about their claim that what they have put in place for your daughter is in her best interests.", "That makes sense haha. But he's not that level, that's for them. \n\nMy in laws hate Ruby's existence. My wife lost her life giving birth to Ruby, she wanted the doctors to save our baby over her life. Finding out about the disability made everything worse. They just couldn't accept that I 'sacrificed' my late wife for a 'defect' like Ruby. I don't think I'll ever hate anyone more.", "He knows some. More than Amanda, but not really fluent. Basically just enough to manage to talk to Ruby. They get along well enough.

Do you have any idea how difficult it is to try mightily, be left behind, and then, instead of having your efforts acknowledged and receiving support and encouragement, to be berated?\n\nLearning a language is a skill some acquire easily and with which others struggle. I learn languages unusually quickly; my mother and brother don\u2019t. I\u2019d never dream of calling either selfish or lazy for not meeting a milestone at a preconceived time.\n\nIt sucks that Amanda feels uncomfortable sharing her learning with you and Mia and feels the need to learn away from you and her.

Google \"beginning ASL classes and the name of your town or nearby metro area.  \n\n\nAlso check to see if your local library offers Kanopy or Hoopladigital-- both are free streaming services that are ONLY available using your library card and both have some great kid's videos for learning ASL that teach basic signs.  There are some great basic ASL videos on Youtube as well.

As an adult, I've tried to relearn it and have the majority of the alphabet memorized, but it's so much harder than it once was. If this brings her any solace, she's not alone in realizing languages, even sign, are harder to learn once we're older. Patience, and getting help from a professional is not a bad idea whatsoever, a few community colleges offer the course for beginners. I genuinely wish you and your girlfriend good luck in continuing to learn and communicate with one another, as well as your daughter, and I do hope it gets easier for her.", "NAH, as far as actual judgement on Amanda and you.   I think your brother is off-base.  You rightfully want your daughter to be be comfortable at home with your girlfriend;  Your girlfriend is being asked to new language which is a lot to ask.  I think grace and compassion is warranted more than judgement.\n\nMaybe try to do some fun things together to distract or remind of why this matters.", "Who is Mia?

It was relatively inexpensive and I learned a LOT. Aside from learning for Mia's sake, Amanda should know that learning ASL could potentially help her in many social situations. For instance, helping someone in the checkout at a grocery store. giving directions to a deaf/hard of hearing person in a shopping center, or just communicating privately with the family that you're all over this party and want to leave ASAP. ASL is an amazing language that becomes more intuitive the more you use it and I highly recommend everyone learn it and/or attempt to teach it to their children before they learn to talk (you'll be surprised how much toddlers can communicate their wants and needs long before they can formulate spoken words).", "I\u2019m glad you guys had a discussion and figured it out.

We took two electives along with our core classes. Spanish and French were offered as language options, but I guess the kid\u2019s family moved to the area in the summer and the school had the time to go find and hire an ASL teacher because when it was time to pick electives before the year started, that was a new choice. It was a pretty popular choice too. My younger siblings had the option even years later and it was always a full class even after the deaf student left for high school. That was in the 1980\u2019s, though granted a private school with more money to do things like that than your typical public school.
