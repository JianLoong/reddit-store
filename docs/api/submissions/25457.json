Let me help you with the baby so you can set some things down and get situated since I know you\u2019ve been sick too.\u201d\n\nNTA. But your husband is about as big of an AH as they come.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds to me like your husband feels that when he's gaming, he has no obligation to his child and that watching her is entirely on you. So, even if the child wanders into the bedroom and you're nowhere in sight, he is free to ignore his daughter and focus on gaming.\n\nThat's not how it works. Unless he's working from home (in which case, the door should be closed), then your child is both your responsibility.\n\nYour husband is completely the asshole here, in a major way. I find it utterly amazing that all he had to do was reach out and move his coffee cup out of the way, when his daughter was less than two feet away, but somehow, this is entirely your fault while you were in the next room.\n\nYour child is at the age where she can walk quite capably on her own. And you both need to be prepared.\n\nIn addition, your husband's expectations that you do a quick check of the house, assess every possible situation, before you set your child down so you can put your keys away, is unrealistic.\n\nHe knows it's his own fault. You have a toddler who is capable of getting into stuff. And it's both your responsibility to watch out for her.", "NTA.\n\nYou can't be expected to walk around holding your daughter at all times so that your husband doesn't have to worry if she can reach his coffee mug. He just needs to remember to always put his mug where she can't reach it.\n\nYour husband was screaming at you for his own mistake.  To be clear, putting your daughter down on the floor once you got home was not even a \"mistake\" on your part. Your husband was the one inadvertantly at fault, for having a mug of coffee where she could reach it. He compounded that fault by abusing you for his own mistake.", "Wait wait wait.... You have 2 kids and you're responsible for both of them, including going to the doctor (and that should be done with both parents when possible because... 2 kids) and he's gaming.... I think the problem here isn't the coffee , the keys or leaving the kid on the floor (yes, kids need to crawl to learn how to walk, can't be in arms 24/7) but a husband problem.... He's not acting like he has 2 kids... 2 sick kids...", "NTA- can\u2019t see how people are saying y t a. Toddlers able to walk are going to cause accidents. Yes, your husband could have been caught off guard but maybe he shouldn\u2019t have been so absorbed in his game he couldn\u2019t hear a toddler walk into the room he was in, or left things within reach. Why is it your job to check his immediate surroundings?", "NTA! HIS coffee on HIS desk and somehow it's YOUR fault? In a house with kids living in it you've always got to assume a kid could enter the room at any moment and grab at something. Screaming at you and degrading you is also 100% not called for.", "I say NTA. Every parent had made some mistakes along the way, your husband seems to be going to an extreme by literally screaming at you, lecturing you,  and not even being able to look at you. Not a great reaction to something that could be squashed instead of blown up. \n\nPlus not to look to throw around blame but the guy was playing games at the computer. He could've prevented it too.", "NTA. Humans are often on the floor. You ideally should have been watching the baby, but can't at all times. He should have closed the baby gate if he had a dangerous condition in his office. He probably felt bad that he allowed this to happen and has an unfortunate impulse to shift blame rather than just taking this as a learning experience for both of you. Blaming and yelling were uncalled for. A mutual debriefing to see how to avoid the potential risk in the future would have been the sane route.", "NTA. He is also the parent here. When you have kids, accidents happen. It's not a huge deal your LO spilled a drink (it is lucky it wasn't hot). But it does not need yelling and name calling.", "NTA, it's his kid as well, you didn't do it intentionally and a 15 mo child is nearing toddler state, it's fine to let them on the floor", "So kid hit his table, his lukewarm coffee spilled, he got pissed off and called you names after you went to the paediatrician (alone) and set the baby down like a NORMAL human?\n\nDid he even change the baby out of the coffee-clothes or is that solely your responsibility too? \n\nDid he even bother to ask what the doctor said?\n\nNo one can scan the nook and cranny of a home to identify if there\u2019s anything unsafe. There\u2019s largely a glance and then faith in yourself and your partner to navigate any mishaps before putting the baby down. Idk how you\u2019ll trust him from now. Instead of being concerned for the kid, he yells at you (making the kid even more scared I suspect)\n\nSomeone commented about greeting your wife when she enters the home with your sick child. He didn\u2019t do that either did he. \n\nSeems like an absent father (at least where gaming is concerned) and an abusive one too. \n\nNTA.", "100% NTA. \n\nAccidents happen. Sure they can be avoided but when you are ill, tired, have a multiple things going on......\n\nYour husband also has the responsibility to place his coffee out of reach, because you know what? TODDLERS ARE NOT KNOWN TO JUST SIT STILL!\n\nGranted he has the right to get mad in the instant, but he also needs to take responsibility. \n\nYou are both tired. Now is the time to support each other by working together.", "NTA, it's totally normal to put kids on the floor, especially at 15 months, since she is most likely walking by now, or cruising.\n\nShit happens I can't tell you how many times my kids of nearly killed themselves. \n\nThough arguing about isn't going to solve anything, there's a baby gate for a reason it should have been up.\n\nDon't listen to anyone who is calling you YTA, they either don't have kids, or are bulldozer parents who will find all kinds of problems in the future.", "NTA. Verbal abuse is also abuse. He should be doing his share of the parenting instead of leaving it to you and playing games.", "This terminology doesn\u2019t make sense. \u201cPut her on the floor\u201d\u2026 she\u2019s a walking almost-toddler.

Is that his normal reaction ?", "NTA, parents make mistakes, luckily this was a minor one. But your husband sure is, i really hope he doesnt make a habit out of calling you stupid.", "NTA!! Kids do this shit all the time, that\u2019s why we baby proof the house, why was the baby gate open? Your husband needs to learn that it\u2019s his kid too and he should act like a father instead of teenager. Your husband should learn to control his temper, his children seeing him yell and berate his wife for simple things is not good for them. They\u2019ll grow up traumatized with an unhealthy view of relationships.", "NTA\nLet's list the thuings that happened to create thia situation shall we:\nMom enters house,  leaves walking toddler down to secure front door.\nDad leaves todder gate open,  leaves hot coffee within reach of toddler, picks up toddler that just had hot spilled on her and instead of helping to clean her up (take off clothes,  get to cool water) and comfort her decides to shout at wife about how irresponsible she is. Ya,  it's fairly obvious your husband made SEVERAL mistakes here and is blaming you for the outcome. Don't let him speak to you like this again.  Everybody knows if you have smallies in the house, you act like they are always tryin to kill themselves and you don't give them opportunities to do so. Your husband sucks.", "No.  Christ, toddlers practically live on the floor.  He's just deflecting because he left the cup on the wrong place.", "NTA - stopped reading after he verbally abused you. His opinions are invalid and he\u2019s TA.", "You are both human and both realize what could have happened here.\n\nDon't blame each other, but learn from this and thank your lucky stars that nothing bad happened.", "Based on this one incident, I'm going to say NAH. You should have been more careful and your husband shouldn't have yelled at you.

This is assuming that it was out of character for both of you.", "You seem new to this. Here's a life lesson:\n\nShit happens, you are not omnipotent and sometimes you can fuck up. Blame doesn't do anything. It can be you, it can be him and it makes 0 difference. Solve the problem at hand, be thankful that the kid has no burns and learn from it.\n\nAs a general tip it's a good idea to teach your child coffee cups are hot. My twins knew that already when they were one. We did it as a game. I actively showed them my coffee cup and told them it's hot, then touched it with my finger and showed them a reaction like I've got burned. Then I let  them try it for themselves. The glass wasn't really hot enough to burn but enough to show them it's not something they'd want to touch. Repeat this enough and it will save you a lot of trouble down the line.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Forgot the subreddit for a moment. NTA.", "Info: what your husband doing in the PC?

It could have been hot coffee but you know now and won't make that mistake again. Your husband probably had the coffee placed where she could reach it. That's on him. He is trying to displace his portion of the blame on you. We are not perfect as parents, we make mistakes but then take that on board and move on.\n\nYou'll perfect the technique of looking after her now, by which time she'll be older and have developed new ways of testing your parenting skills. I don't know how my kids survived childhood and I think I was very careful with them. We still had one set of fingers jammed in a car door and one child being xrayed because they'd swallowed a coin.
