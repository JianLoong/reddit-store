I just got back from taking my 15 month old to the doctor and put her down on the floor while I was putting my keys away.

My husband dragged her away and I ran to grab her while he was screaming at me yelling things like are you for real? Why weren't you watching her? How could you be so stupid! I should note the baby gate to the room was opened, and I didn't know he had a coffee, his desk is obscured by the PC so I couldn't see anything on his desk. She is very fast but not even as tall as the desk, so she can reach things that are just at the edge of the desk. He said I shouldn't have put her down on the floor and that if I did I should have been 100% sure and checked all ofy surroundings before I did it. It was an accident I couldn't see anything. I said he should also not leave things on the edge of his desk where the kids can get them. He thinks it's 100% my fault and is super mad at me and won't even look at me. Am I in the wrong? Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit to answer a few questions: 3yo wasn't home, and husband heard us come in I called out and announced we were home. The computer is about 10 feet away from the front door on the other side of a wall. Perhaps my fault I should have told him I was putting her down or made sure the baby gate was closed myself.

Let me help you with the baby so you can set some things down and get situated since I know you\u2019ve been sick too.\u201d\n\nNTA. But your husband is about as big of an AH as they come.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds to me like your husband feels that when he's gaming, he has no obligation to his child and that watching her is entirely on you. So, even if the child wanders into the bedroom and you're nowhere in sight, he is free to ignore his daughter and focus on gaming.\n\nThat's not how it works. Unless he's working from home (in which case, the door should be closed), then your child is both your responsibility.\n\nYour husband is completely the asshole here, in a major way. I find it utterly amazing that all he had to do was reach out and move his coffee cup out of the way, when his daughter was less than two feet away, but somehow, this is entirely your fault while you were in the next room.\n\nYour child is at the age where she can walk quite capably on her own. And you both need to be prepared.\n\nIn addition, your husband's expectations that you do a quick check of the house, assess every possible situation, before you set your child down so you can put your keys away, is unrealistic.\n\nHe knows it's his own fault. You have a toddler who is capable of getting into stuff. And it's both your responsibility to watch out for her.", "NTA.\n\nYou can't be expected to walk around holding your daughter at all times so that your husband doesn't have to worry if she can reach his coffee mug. He just needs to remember to always put his mug where she can't reach it.\n\nYour husband was screaming at you for his own mistake.  To be clear, putting your daughter down on the floor once you got home was not even a \"mistake\" on your part. Your husband was the one inadvertantly at fault, for having a mug of coffee where she could reach it. He compounded that fault by abusing you for his own mistake.", "Wait wait wait.... You have 2 kids and you're responsible for both of them, including going to the doctor (and that should be done with both parents when possible because... 2 kids) and he's gaming.... I think the problem here isn't the coffee , the keys or leaving the kid on the floor (yes, kids need to crawl to learn how to walk, can't be in arms 24/7) but a husband problem.... He's not acting like he has 2 kids... 2 sick kids...", "NTA- can\u2019t see how people are saying y t a. Toddlers able to walk are going to cause accidents. Yes, your husband could have been caught off guard but maybe he shouldn\u2019t have been so absorbed in his game he couldn\u2019t hear a toddler walk into the room he was in, or left things within reach. Why is it your job to check his immediate surroundings?", "NTA! HIS coffee on HIS desk and somehow it's YOUR fault? In a house with kids living in it you've always got to assume a kid could enter the room at any moment and grab at something. Screaming at you and degrading you is also 100% not called for.", "I say NTA. Every parent had made some mistakes along the way, your husband seems to be going to an extreme by literally screaming at you, lecturing you,  and not even being able to look at you. Not a great reaction to something that could be squashed instead of blown up. \n\nPlus not to look to throw around blame but the guy was playing games at the computer. He could've prevented it too.", "NTA. Humans are often on the floor. You ideally should have been watching the baby, but can't at all times. He should have closed the baby gate if he had a dangerous condition in his office. He probably felt bad that he allowed this to happen and has an unfortunate impulse to shift blame rather than just taking this as a learning experience for both of you. Blaming and yelling were uncalled for. A mutual debriefing to see how to avoid the potential risk in the future would have been the sane route.", "NTA. He is also the parent here. When you have kids, accidents happen. It's not a huge deal your LO spilled a drink (it is lucky it wasn't hot). But it does not need yelling and name calling.", "NTA, it's his kid as well, you didn't do it intentionally and a 15 mo child is nearing toddler state, it's fine to let them on the floor", "So kid hit his table, his lukewarm coffee spilled, he got pissed off and called you names after you went to the paediatrician (alone) and set the baby down like a NORMAL human?\n\nDid he even change the baby out of the coffee-clothes or is that solely your responsibility too? \n\nDid he even bother to ask what the doctor said?\n\nNo one can scan the nook and cranny of a home to identify if there\u2019s anything unsafe. There\u2019s largely a glance and then faith in yourself and your partner to navigate any mishaps before putting the baby down. Idk how you\u2019ll trust him from now. Instead of being concerned for the kid, he yells at you (making the kid even more scared I suspect)\n\nSomeone commented about greeting your wife when she enters the home with your sick child. He didn\u2019t do that either did he. \n\nSeems like an absent father (at least where gaming is concerned) and an abusive one too. \n\nNTA.", "100% NTA. \n\nAccidents happen. Sure they can be avoided but when you are ill, tired, have a multiple things going on......\n\nYour husband also has the responsibility to place his coffee out of reach, because you know what? TODDLERS ARE NOT KNOWN TO JUST SIT STILL!\n\nGranted he has the right to get mad in the instant, but he also needs to take responsibility. \n\nYou are both tired. Now is the time to support each other by working together.", "NTA, it's totally normal to put kids on the floor, especially at 15 months, since she is most likely walking by now, or cruising.\n\nShit happens I can't tell you how many times my kids of nearly killed themselves. \n\nThough arguing about isn't going to solve anything, there's a baby gate for a reason it should have been up.\n\nDon't listen to anyone who is calling you YTA, they either don't have kids, or are bulldozer parents who will find all kinds of problems in the future.", "NTA. Verbal abuse is also abuse.

Kids do this shit all the time, that\u2019s why we baby proof the house, why did your husband leave the baby gate open? Your husband needs to learn that it\u2019s his kid too and he should act like a father instead of teenager. Your husband should learn to control his temper, his children seeing him yell and berate his wife for simple things is not good for them.

Ya,  it's fairly obvious your husband made SEVERAL mistakes here and is blaming you for the outcome. Don't let him speak to you like this again.  Everybody knows if you have smallies in the house, you act like they are always tryin to kill themselves and you don't give them opportunities to do so.

I added periods between the letters below to discount it from the vote while not changing my original comment.\n\nBased on this one incident, I'm going to say N.A.H. You should have been more careful and your husband shouldn't have yelled at you.

Blame doesn't do anything. It can be you, it can be him and it makes 0 difference. Solve the problem at hand, be thankful that the kid has no burns and learn from it.\n\nAs a general tip it's a good idea to teach your child coffee cups are hot. My twins knew that already when they were one. We did it as a game. I actively showed them my coffee cup and told them it's hot, then touched it with my finger and showed them a reaction like I've got burned. Then I let  them try it for themselves. The glass wasn't really hot enough to burn but enough to show them it's not something they'd want to touch. Repeat this enough and it will save you a lot of trouble down the line.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Forgot the subreddit for a moment. NTA.", "Info: what your husband doing in the PC?

It could have been hot coffee but you know now and won't make that mistake again. Your husband probably had the coffee placed where she could reach it. That's on him. He is trying to displace his portion of the blame on you. We are not perfect as parents, we make mistakes but then take that on board and move on.\n\nYou'll perfect the technique of looking after her now, by which time she'll be older and have developed new ways of testing your parenting skills. I don't know how my kids survived childhood and I think I was very careful with them. We still had one set of fingers jammed in a car door and one child being xrayed because they'd swallowed a coin.

Setting the baby down, you not realizing she walked away from you/ him not realizing she had entered the room; they are even more understandable.

She assumed it would be closed or didn't assume it was dangerous even if it wasn't.\n\nSo this is just when you both realise you were lucky the coffee wasn't hot, count your blessings kid is fine and realise what you can do better in the future to ensure it doesn't happen again.\n\nThis is NOT when you start berating your partner for very understandable behaviour. If she'd started berating him for not closing the gate she would have been in the wrong too. Because at the end of the day it's a small lapse of judgement and neither parent deserves to have their partner speak to them like that over such minor stuff.\n\nEven worse than this is berating very likely happened in front of the child.

You two are into some finer details I think, and I've noticed this \"misandry/misogyny\" stuff before too, and what I see is that in general, with a gender reversal, you would in fact get some people who will tend to identify with the perspective of one particular gender.  You could easily imagine that someone would support the OP even as the gamer, saying that it's the husband's responsibility to know basic standards of care, you *never* put an infant on the floor, etc. and they will sometimes get a million upvotes that way.  \n\nThe big thing is that AITA is binary 99% of the time, that's the point, it's YTA or NTA, that's what we're here for. However in lots of cases, with the right argument, you can justify and rationalize either side, especially if you consider you're starting with a biased story to begin with, and let your mind fill in the blanks, as a lot of us tend to naturally do.  Those blanks we fill in are also partly bias.  So a big challenge of these stories is that you have to be able to recognize and think through those biases.  Not all of us can do that, or even try, or really even want to.  When we just go with the character we naturally feel is correct, and we don't challenge that by testing ourselves for bias, we can come up with conclusions that feel inarguably correct but in fact do not appear to be completely consistent. \n\n The major issue is that occasionally you may see this has happened on a post, or it may be pointed out that you are actually participating in it, and because it's reddit, it comes out as an accusation of sexism, when really all that is happening is that people are identifying with who they naturally are drawn to, and will subconsciously approach the question as to rationalize their protagonist's behavior.  It's perfectly normal bias that can be pointed out in other ways, which are not as incendiary and accusatory, and that don't imply bad faith or anything like that. \n\n Moreover, if all the women are siding with the woman, and you feel that is sexist, you should probably consider whether your own biases are clouding your ability to see why exactly they are identifying with a character who you feel is objectively wrong, and perhaps why you are not seeing what they are able to see so clearly.  I don't really know any way to help things ultimately, but thanks for having your discussion about this so far in a civil way, so I could clarify some of my thoughts about it.  \n\nFor what it's worth, it seems like you both have justifiable votes, and my observations are in no way judging whether either of are you are biased, nor did I mean to try to determine that.
