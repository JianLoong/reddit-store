When I wrote \u201chusband\u201d I meant the in-law baby daddy, aka BIL. BIL should have been asked to watch his own kid. Not OP\u2019s husband. It\u2019s not his job to watch the kid either.", "Aahh alright. I'm sorry, I probably misunderstood. English is not my first language. Like I said, she maybe could have reacted differently. Yet again it's not her responsibility, so for saying no to her SIL and SIL's \"problems\" OP is NTA imo."]}
