I told her to go get her husband to help because he was only playing football.\n\nShe and her family think I\u2019m TA because I already had a play pen and baby monitor setup for my child.

Weird that Mommy\u2019s mad at you for putting the idea in DIL\u2019s head that her darling son should help.", "Why didn't Amy MIL watch her grandchild E so Amy could nap& Amys' SO could play? \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. If Amy's ML has an opinion, maybe Amy's MIL should have offered to babysit.", "NTA, Amy should be mad at her husband. It's not your fault she's married to a dud and not your responsibility to care for their child.", "NTA. Someone needed to remind Amy she has a baby daddy.", "NTA. In a house full of adults, there were plenty of people who could step up. You had a legitimate reason not to watch her kid. All you did was offer an alternative when you said no.", "NTA What if you had agreed, but then had an urgent issue come up with your own child which required you to step away from the playpen? What if you finished your emails and want to take your child to play, but now you're stuck watching 2 kids, one of which needs significant supervision while crawling around and the other which could toddle off in any direction?\n\nYou had every right to say no, and I don't think it was inappropriate at all to inquire about where the baby's dad was. Why couldn't he watch their baby so the mom could nap? Their family child care needs have nothing to do with you. \n\nTell your in-laws that they should volunteer to watch Amy's baby so she can rest and baby's dad can continue fucking off wherever he is.", "I was pleasantly surprised by Amy. I thought that she would be mad at you. Instead, your reasonable question as to why her husband doesn't help her out with watching their kid helped open her eyes. You can't be blamed for that, it was a legitimate question that could lead to long term improvement in his parenting.\n\nI was predisposed to say that if you were watching your kid then you could watch their kid at the same time. If you were playing with your kid, you could play with both. But you were only watching your kid and you had a good reason why you couldn't take the time to play. You are NTA.", "NTA. Taking a nap is not a valid reason to dump your baby on someone else.", "NTA. you could have offered some other time I guess, but she should be finding someone (not working) who will babysit if she's that tired. You don't know how the kid would have reacted to you, therefore it could make you minding your work very difficult.", "NTA, it always amazes me when people demand help with their children from everybody but the other person responsible for creating said children, and as far as I can tell you didn't help Amy make her baby. \n\nIt's not your fault Amy has a baby with someone who is not interested in being a parent. This is not you problem, it's an Amy and her husband problem. And since her MIL has so much to say, I don't see why she couldn't take her grandkids because her deadbeat son was busy.", "NTA for not wanting to watch her kid, but you were rude. All you had to say was you\u2019re busy and your baby is going down so you can\u2019t. As for their pouting, that\u2019s on them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Seriously it can't be the luck of the draw if you get a partner who will help out 50-50. I feel there a tons of warning signs before hand to let you know if your SO is the type of partner who will help out with responsibilities 50-50.
