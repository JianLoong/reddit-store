IMO next time your friend wants to invite his boyfriend tell him you and others get really uncomfortable when they argue and to please save it until they're alone or leave the room if they have to. if he doesn't respect the boundary after that you're well within your rights to refuse to let the boyfriend hang out with y'all.", "YTA, for putting up with something you don\u2019t have to.", "YWNBTA. I would phrase it just like you said in your post. We love having you guys around but when we get together we want to chill, catch up, etc. When you guys are around you bring with your drama and it\u2019s making us uncomfortable. We want you both to continue coming but not if you\u2019re going to argue, fight, etc.", "YWNBTA - they\u2019re physically fighting. Not cool. \n\nI would say something.", "NTA- you are allowed to your opinion and if others in the group don't like it as well you could say something. just try to phrase it as nicely as possible", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to your feelings and are allowed to make them known to them. I would even go so far as saying that only if you speak up there is any chance for them to change their obviously annoying behavior since they don't seem to be aware of it.\n\nJust make sure that this is not against them personally or even as a couple, but about how their behavior affects the mood if everyone around them.\n\nIf they don't change after this and your friend continues to be annoyingly all about his BF you may even want to consider to let the friendship sizzle out. Don't necessarily make a big affair out if it, but basically let the friendship die a natural death, as is not uncommon when people, values, and/or goals change and are no longer compatible.", "NTA. Kind of sounds like this guy and his boyfriend don't fit the group anymore though? Maybe invite them less.", "NTA. If no one is having a good time because of their fighting someone should say something. It more than likely will either embarrass them into stopping or embarrassing them enough to stay away.", "The thing is they don't even seem happy or \"entertained\" by it, tho my friend thinks it's cute how his boyfriend yells at him as he thinks it makes him masculine.\n\nI am just realizing how cringe their whole relationship is while typing this lmao.", "I just hope he won't take it personally and understand that even if it was any of us we would react the same way.", "He is a roommate with our other friend who sadly is taking the biggest slap as he is around the couple the whole day so it will be cocky not to invite them.\n\nHe feels miserable about it.", "If you show genuine concern for their relationship he may welcome the discussion. Maybe start with \u201care you two okay because we\u2019re all really concerned and frankly uncomfortable when you guys around. It seems like you\u2019re always fighting about something and that\u2019s not healthy.", "If he's going to take it personal there is nothing you can do about it. All you have control over is what and how you say it. As long as you're friendly about it and say something like you said in your post or like the commenter above said, you have nothing to feel guilty about."]}
