We don't know the sex of the baby but we've started thinking about baby names. A couple of nights ago we were suggesting names. I had a girlfriend for around 6 years before meeting my now wife. Unfortunately she passed away and I was absolutely devastated. It's still painful to think about and I always imagined naming a child in her memory. I also just love the name itself (Nancy). When I made the suggestion to my wife she seemed unimpressed. She told me she didn't really feel comfortable with doing that. She felt it was strange and didn't make sense as Nancy had been my girlfriend. The way I see it is that Nancy was very important to me for a really long time. She was my best friend and losing her was just a terrible thing. I feel as though it would be a great way to remember and honour a dear friend who I miss everyday.  My wife doesn't share my views and honestly its caused a lot of issues. I dropped it and said it was important we both agreed on the name but she's still insisting it's strange and she doesn't understand why I suggested it. I don't know if she feels insecure or maybe the pregnancy is stressing her but she just won't drop it. I honestly don't see the issue whatsoever. AITA?\n\n\nI just thought I'd put a quick edit/disclaimer/update here if anyone was interested. It seems like most people have said that I'm wrong in this situation which is understandable. I think I'll apologise again and hopefully the situation will end there. It probably was a weird idea and maybe I wasn't seeing that clearly as I'm still grieving to some extent. I also just wanted to make it clear that myself and Nancy weren't together when she passed. Nancy passed around two years after we separated but we had decided to stay friends. I met my wife around 2 months before Nancy and I separated. I probably should have mentioned that in the original post but maybe it doesn't make much of a difference.

While it is okay for you to miss your ex-girlfriend and rightfully so, if she passed away, but naming your child after her will signify that she will always be on your tongue, when you will call out for your daughter. It is not fair to your wife for having to live with the fact that you will always have the memory of Nancy for the rest of your life, in the form of your daughter. \n\nIt is okay to grieve her, but your wife did not know her.
