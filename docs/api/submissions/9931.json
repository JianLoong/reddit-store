It\u2019s okay to still feel sad, but your wife does not need a daily reminder of your ex girlfriend. I\u2019ll be damned if I grow a baby for nine months just to name it after my husbands ex. You need to show more respect to your wife and ask her to forgive you.", "YTA.  I was ready to consider that you dropped it as a mitigating factor, yet you\u2019re continuing to profess incredulity and blame it on pregnancy stress and hormones for her  VERY NORMAL response and reaction of WTF", "YTA - this is your wife\u2019s baby too and you want HER to think about someone you intimately loved before you married her? Ouch. You can\u2019t honestly think that wouldn\u2019t be hurtful, do you?", "YTA. I don't think there's any way suggesting to honor an ex over all the names in the world isn't going to come off as insulting. It's going to come off like you would definitely be with her if she were still alive vibes.", "YTA, and it's a good bet your wife now wonders if you're thinking about Nancy when you're with her.", "YTA. C'mon man, use your brain. A: she is feeling big and ugly at this stage. B: she is already probably insecure about a girl you obviously have put on a pedestal in death (perfectly normal to do C: she doesn't want to be reminded of the love you held for someone else....fix it by apologizing and never bringing it up again", "YtA...you do realize that this is her baby too, right? You'd be asking her to say your ex girlfriends name 20x a day for the rest of her life just so you can \"honour\" a memor. I'm sorry about your loss but how about you focus on the present. Plant a tree... donate to a charity but jfc move on man.", "YTA.

I loved and valued this person so much, I want to name our unborn child after her. That is exactly how it comes across and how is your very pregnant wife supposed to feel about that? If the roles were reversed and she was telling you she wanted to name your son after a boyfriend who dies (and she probably would have married), how would you feel? Grow up, apologize and tell her you agree it was a stupid idea and you will never bring it up again.", "YTA. You say you miss her every day, so it doesn't sound like you don't have a problem remembering her. I hope it's a boy and your wife names it for an ex, then leaves you so you can spend the rest of your life missing Nancy.", "YTA\n\n\nShe is not dropping it because you didn't just suggest it. If it would've been just a suggestion, your wife would've told you she isn't comfortable with that and you would've been fine with it. You weren't fine with it.

And not one is your wife being irrational insecure. To just name a few- how will the ex-gfs family feel about it?, what if your daughter is the absolut opposide of nancy?, are you planning on telling her who she was named after? How will that look to others? (Yes, depending on where you live has weight on how she and her mom will be treated-greetings small town life)", "YTA\n\nNaming your child after your ex is so wildly inappropriate. Your Wife has no ties to Nancy, so why would she want to name her child after a stranger? Especially the one who makes her sound like second place.

You cannot expect your wife to want to name HER CHILD after your deceased girlfriend because you want to name YOUR (singular) CHILD after her. Do you see it ?\n\nThis chid BELONG TO BOTH OF YOU. YOUR (collective) child should have a name you both want. If you push this, your wife will feel like she has to live in the shadow of your deceased girlfriend.  That will strain the marriage and can cause irreparable damage.

While it is okay for you to miss your ex-girlfriend and rightfully so, if she passed away, but naming your child after her will signify that she will always be on your tongue, when you will call out for your daughter. It is not fair to your wife for having to live with the fact that you will always have the memory of Nancy for the rest of your life, in the form of your daughter. \n\nIt is okay to grieve her, but your wife did not know her. Your wife was not a part of your relationship and naming your kid that will mean you will never ever let the spirit of Nancy go.", "Lmao you don\u2019t just suggest you and your wife name your child after your ex.

I hope she leaves you and finds someone who loves her as a first place winner and not a distant second.  \n\nYour suggestion shows a narcicism and disregard that is staggering. It's incomprehensible that you thought this was a good idea.  You're incapable of even the simplest forms of empathy. You only see yourself. Your wife is not even a person to you. She's just a thing that you use.", "YTA wow imagine calling your heavily pregnant wife insecure while pushing this issue.\n\nWhy would your partner want to look at her own child everyday and be reminded of your deceased ex? She may have meant the world to you which your poor partner now knows but she meant nothing to her. Also give your daughter her own name to live with not 1 of your dead ex who again won't mean anything to her, don't do that to your own daughter.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yay, win.\n\nI assume you'll love your daughter very much, and everytime you show affection towards her, your wife may have a voice in her back of the head saying the love you are showing is the love you had for your late GF (she was/is not ex) which may result in her resenting you\n\nScenario 2: you throw a tantrum like \"Fine I give up, I won't name her that, happy now?\" without having an adult conversation with your wife like a normal grown up, your wife names your daughter some other name.

And to me is astonishing the amount of people that wouldn't understand a partner grieving, and even more so the amount of people that would turn that grieving into an attack to their person. Like how fucking insecure and shitty are you to be jealous of a dead person? I'm not saying the pregnant wife should name her daughter that name, I'm just saying that not understanding your partner and taking an insult to their grief is a fucking crazy and shitty thing to do.", "What is ridiculous is your suggestion. Have you ever had any person close to you die? Would you feel honoring them by making donations? How shitty are you? You just overlooked that man's grief. A 6 year relationship with your best friend is not just anything. And she was aware of his situation. She doesn't have to agree, but not even understanding your partners point of view? Who raised y'all?", "Lol, I'm not insecure at all. \n\nAnd jealousy is irrelevant. \n\nEveryone here, wife included, finds it weird and disrespectful. \n\nWhy do you think the dead woman trumps the living woman creating the human?\n\nHis grief is not a pass to disrespect his wife, period. \n\nHe did zero of the work to create the child and he wants to name it *after a dead woman he used to fuck.*\n\nThat's weird.", "Lol, ridiculous. His grief over an ex doesn\u2019t mean  he gets to name their baby after her.

He said he dropped it, told her both should agree and then she kept saying how weird it is. And what about his feelings, she didn't even tried to tell him that she understands his grief but that the name would make her feel uncomfortable, she just berated him, and that is fucked up. \nWhat is ridiculous is your implication that Im pro naming the baby his dead gf's name, I just think that he is being treated unfair and that his feelings are being overlooked and minimized. It's not a weird thing wanting to honor important people in our life.", "I'm not insecure because I disagree with you. \n\nBut it's extremely rude to continue insulting me for no reason; it undermines whatever point you think you've made.

She never tried to empathize and then explain to him that she wouldn't be ok with the name. She just called his grief weird and basically told him that he is attacking her for grieving. \nOnly I disagree because all of you just don't care about the guys feelings. He just wants to know if wanting to honor his dead gf is an asshole move and I don't think so. I'm not saying he should do it, but I don't think that honoring important people is an asshole move.", "Your dismissal of his feelings is astonishing. Have you ever had close people to you die? You think is something people just get over? Is he not allowed to grief? \nI'm not saying they should be set on that name, neither is him, in just saying that his partner dismissing his feelings is wrong. \nBut all of you seem to think that he should just suck up his feelings an man up.
