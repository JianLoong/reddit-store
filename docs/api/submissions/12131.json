I\u2019m white, and my Slavic ass grew up using tonnes of herbs and spices (pretty much w very person in my country has a box full of spices). Granted, I like my food spicier than most people from my country but they like their spices just fine.\n\nThis week, my friend asked if she could bring her new boyfriend who none of our friends had met yet and I said sure.\n\nI made an amazing vegetable stew with beans, corn, pepper, jalape\u00f1os, etc. served with rice or bread. I use a lot of spices and it\u2019s got a lot of heat but it\u2019s layered and is just beautiful and doesn\u2019t overwhelm other flavours and can be made milder with some sour cream on top.\n\nMy friends boyfriend was amazed and had seconds and found it delicious. He asked (important to mention that he\u2019s black) where I ordered it from. I said I didn\u2019t and I made it. He didn\u2019t believe me and I repeated that I made it from scratch. He wouldn\u2019t let it go and insisted on who taught me that. I said, it\u2019s a basic recipe that I came up with on my own based on veggies and spices I like.\nHe still wouldn\u2019t believe me and said that I should stop lying because white people\u2019s food is bland and someone had to teach me how to use spices so it\u2019s edible.\n\nHonestly, I was offended at that and told him that. He said \u201csorry, it was a joke\u201d but despite that, he continued with \u201cseriously, who taught you how to use spices, they were black, weren\u2019t they.\u201d\n\nI told him to leave. I found this whole exchange inappropriate.\nHe called me a stuck up bitch who can\u2019t take a joke and left. My friend is angry with me, the afternoon was ruined and everyone left. I\u2019m just sitting here wondering if I was the asshole here and perhaps I did overreact.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

A stranger eats your cooking and enjoys it, then proceeds to accuse you of serving takeout, then demands to know who \"taught\" you, and slurs cooking by another race, thereby ruining a social meal. Dude has issues, none of which are your fault.", "Nta....I  am white and can cook. I won a Mac and cheese cook off. My black co workers were pissed. They kept asking  who I stole the recipe from. They didn't believe that it came from a time my grandma and I were cooking.", "As a black person- wtf? Why would he act like this? There's joking, and then there's mocking and undermining a person's abilities TO THEIR FACE.

Before that it might have been possible that he was just an idiot with a shitty sense of humour pushing a bad joke too far. Using vile language like that to describe someone who you just met, who was hosting and feeding you is something only the worst people would do.", "NTA - He was racist and kept up an unfunny \u201cjoke\u201d after you made it clear you found it offensive. He was an abhorrent guest. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong here, he was rude and your friend needs to recognize that you were in no way at fault.", "nta\n\nthat dude was a racist idiot. i had thrown him out as well, such behavior isnt on.", "NTA.

Still a shame to assume with no real reason to", "IDK, I think it's always worth maintaining a healthy amount of skepticism when it comes to anonymous posts on the internet. A lot of people will lie and make stuff up for no reason."]}
