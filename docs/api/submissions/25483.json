{"id": 25483, "submission_id": "1610rbq", "title": "AITA for not mowing my neighbor's lawn?", "selftext": "I'm heading out of town for a family emergency so I thought I'd mow the lawn before leaving. I finished the front and back, and as I was wrapping up, my neighbor leaned over the fence. He was drinking beer in one hand and asked \"Hey, wanna do our lawn too?\"\n\nI said \"No, that's okay. Sorry.\"\n\nThen he mentions how the tenant living in the basement mows my lawn a couple of times, which is true: He's done it about 3 times this summer (all without asking me) and also for the neighbor on the other side. \n\nI should mention that our lawns aren't joined in anyway either. Backyards are separated by a fence and the front is separated by pathways, so it's not like I stopped halfway through a joined lawn. (Context: In the past I've told my neighbor that his tenant doesn't have to mow my lawn, and he's told me \"Yeah, I told him he doesn't have to, but he did it anyway\". So I said Thank You at the time and left it at that.)\n\nAnyway, I still say No, and say I'd prefer to keep things separate. He got a bit annoyed and then started asking personal finance questions (how much my mortgage was, etc) which I ~~didn't~~ sidestepped and said I'm managing it.\n\nSo AITA? I feel like if the lawns were at least joined without fencing, then that makes sense to keep them even, but they are separate houses. I might've also done it if the tenant who had done it in the past had asked me, rather than the guy drinking beer and chilling on his deck.\n\nAlso: I'm a single guy maintaining the entire house by myself, but my neighbor has 2 sons and 2 tenants that are looking after their place too. I'm struggling enough on my own, than to be adding chores for my neighbor's on my plate too. \n\nOr maybe it's bad etiquette on my part since their tenant mowed my lawn a couple of times (Again: Without asking or telling me.)\n\nEdit: Fixing grammar", "created_utc": 1692973496, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1610rbq/aita_for_not_mowing_my_neighbors_lawn/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My biggest problem with the post is why this is even a question in your mind.\n\n1. Basement tenant mowed your lawn - without asking or talking with you at all. Maybe nice; maybe not what you wanted and not a favor at all. But if you felt like 'returning a favor, it would be to the tenant, not the nosy neighbor.\n2. There is no connection between the lawns. Even if there were, there is still no obligation to mow for them. We have a very good relationship with our neighbor whose lawn connects to us. If she needed a little hand from us, we would happily do it. We collaborate as needed, but we don't do each other's work and don't expect that of each other. Same with our neighbors across the street. And these are people we have good relationships with.\n3. Even if you have a collaborative relationship with your neighbor, there's no obligation. He asked. You were done and weren't ready to tackle his at the last minute. End of story.\n4. His nosiness about your financial situation is creepy and concerning.\n5. Since his tenant has mowed his lawn before, I have to wonder why the tenant was not mowing the lawn this time: (1) was the tenant just not able (or required) to do it this time and the neighbor was just trying to avoid doing the work himself by cashing in on his tenant's earned goodwill? (2) Is it possible the tenant got sick of the landlord dumping an extra responsibility on him and is no longer willing to do it? None of this is your concern. It just begs the question of whether this neighbor of yours is always angling for something from somebody else.", "NTA what an absolutely bonkers request. I wonder if he has shocked people into doing things for him this way in the past. I used to have a friend who would just ask people if he could have their stuff, like once he asked me if he could have my smoothie blender that I had just gotten for Christmas. And some people would say yes!! It baffled me.", "NTA", "The lawn didn't need a mowing right away. There was growth, but it probably could have gone another week before a cut. But because I'm going out of town for a family emergency, I figured it was best to do it before I left, in case I was delayed and had to stay longer.", "You don\u2019t know what op does and doesn\u2019t offer to to the person that mowed their lawn (without op asking) or if they would even accept op\u2019s repayments and even said that they might\u2019ve done it if it was them who asked and not the guy demanding free labor from someone who doesn\u2019t even live with him."]}
