She accepted to let me visit my dad during hollidays and a weekend every two weeks\n\nNormally it is not about what \"mom accepts\" but about what the court said. (Just like childsupport is not based on \"what dad wants to\").\n\nINFO: what is written on visitation in the custody agreement?", "NTA. You deserve stability, comfort, and privacy as much as your parents can provide. Your father could not do that and it was affecting your schoolwork. You're not the asshole for expressing your feelings. It might help if you emphasize that it does not mean you don't love your father anymore and still want to spend time with him, but until you finish school, you won't be staying with him.", "NTA  \nAs a parent it is his responsibility to provide his child with what is needed. He failed to do so. That's not your fault. And senior year is really important, you can't hurt your future just so you don't hurt his feelings.. maybe this will give him the kick up the arse to get his priorities in order.", "NTA.\n\nHim taking a trip abroad at the expense of your comfort of living shows his priorities are in the wrong place.\n\nYou're well within your rights to be angry and choosing to stay away if that's what you want.", "NTA, and if you were my kid and in this situation, I\u2019d be proud of you too.  Maybe I\u2019m a little bit harsh to say this, but your dad sounds like a bit of a deadbeat to be honest and he isn\u2019t prioritizing you.  You also have to do what is best for you, and if what\u2019s best for you is to stay with your mom, then so be it", "school comes first. if you cant focus on school at dads, than he comes second. you can meet him on we for x amount of time but study at home. he didnt have your back in his previous relationship and not now. it will not change in the future either. NTA", "NTA your doing what's best for you, just because you won't be spending weekends with him doesn't mean that you can't do other stuff with him  and I assume you can still go to your grandparents for the day etc.", "NTA! If you don't feel comfortable in that environment, then you don't go & it's ok! Focus on your school and other stuff in your life. Good for you to stand up!", "NTA good for you you stood your ground", "NTA.\nYour mom is right. You set a reasonable boundary and expressed it clearly. Your focus right now should be your school work and you're doing what you need to do in order to do so. \nIt doesn't sound like you're doing this to be petty or manipulative. You know what you need to study and do well at school, and you're taking reasonable steps to ensure that you have that. \nIt sucks that your dad is upset, but the year before graduation is a lot of stress for students and you need to be able to get the sleep you need and have the space to focus on your studies. \nGood luck with school and kudos to you for setting your boundaries.", "NTA - Taking care of oneself while not hurting others is not always possible, unfortunately. But what is always possible is to voice your needs simply, and be empatheric to other's pain while staying firm in your decision. It seems you handled it like quite well. If you feel sad for your dad, you can tell him you understand he is disapointed and fear to loose contact with you, but that you really need to sleep in in the weekends and want to focus on school. If he voice the fear of loosing you (and if you feel it seems a valid concern), there is always some solutions like spending a day together but going back to sleep at your mon's house.", "Sad for your dad, but his life is a shambles because he made it that way. There's no reason he should be allowed to destroy your life, too. Maybe this will be an incentive for him to stop taking your relationship for granted, and put his energy and money into creating an actual home for himself, where you could be happy to visit.\nYou're NTA.", "NTA! You're very brave for saying what you need. You deserve your own space. I wish you all the best!\n\nAnd your dad will be fine. He's an adult, and he should never be making his own child feel guilty. You are NOT RESPONSIBLE for his feelings.", "NTA, completely understand your feelings but i think your dad has a lot goin on, even if you think he is not saving or spending his money on a holliday. He probably needed the holliday and has a lot of stuff goin on mentally and financially. (He is living with his parents again even tho he is a full grown adult) that is not good for your self esteem. Maybe he has debt and inflation hit the whole world quite hard. Houses are too expensive even is food. Maybe he doesnt see light at the end of the tunnel. So NTA, but i guess you deciding to not come over anymore is just another blow to his face, when it seems like he had quite few. Maybe you could tell him you guys will be doing more picknicks or other non expensive activities to spend time together, i bet that wil cheer him up!", "Nta. Im not too sure your dad is thr asshole either tho. Not enough information and I got the vibe you don't know the information either. At your age it's really common to just see your parents for the day and then go home afterwards. It's OK you don't want to spend the night there anymore because of the lack of room. The reason I say I'm not sure if your dad is the asshole is because I do not get the vibe you really understand his financial situation. He could have bad credit thst is blocking him from buying a home or renting an apartment- but that doesn't stop him from being able to go on trips. The ex gf could have funded parts of those trips before or the computer. He could have gotten a good deal on the Egypt trip. Who knows. Its fair to say he's bad with money regardless. But at least he does love you. Again- dont feel bad. You weren't going to be rotating like that much longer and not having a bedroom is uncomfortable.", "NTA he was NOT sad enough to go on lavish vacations and stuff, while letting you sleep on the floor!  He\u2019s not a good father! Stay away from him.", "NTA, good for you, but would also recommend taking to your grandparents too!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your at an age where you need your own dedicated space.  And he is not and has not prioritized your need for a dedicated space when in his care.  Why doesn\u2019t he have his own place?

That's the deal and anyone not understanding that should stick to houseplants.\nI can't stand parents who make empty promises to their kids.

I'm so sorry he let you down.", "My parents split when I was a tween. It was always way easier for my brother to go back and forth between houses but I always had to pack a big suitcase. I loved being with my dad but when he moved 10 minutes away when I was 15 I had to stay with my mom full time because my friends and life were here. Telling him was one of the hardest things I did.

His dad could try to hire a lawyer and go to court, but that takes a lot of time and $$. By the time this is addressed OP will be finishing HS and it becomes a non issue.

You have needs that are not being met. You didn't state an age, but given how long this was going on, we can assume you're in high school, and grades are going to matter real soon. If you feel like you or your schoolwork is suffering from this arrangement, you are allowed to protect yourself (and your future - if your schoolwork suffers, how will that affect your post-high school life?).
