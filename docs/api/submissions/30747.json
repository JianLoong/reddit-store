Your friend invited you to share a very important celebration in their life with them, something not many people get and some only get once. Rather than celebrating your birthday on a different day, which is a very normal thing if someone has other plans on their Bday, you are choosing yourself over a friends celebratory event.

Your priorities are your own but it still puts you in the asshole spot in this situation). \n\nI\u2019ve had friends miss lifetime milestones of mine (graduations/so on) for similar reasons and it has permanently affected how I see them, even if I try to not hold it against them.

Most people only do one baby shower *ever* because having multiple is considered tacky. A birthday is literally nothing special once you're an adult. You have one every year, and the day is the exact same as the day before it and the day after it. Nothing magical happens because it's your birthday.

Your friend obviously forgot it was your birthday, she kind of sucks for that. But, she\u2019s right that this is a one-time event you don\u2019t get to have ever again, and it clearly means a lot to her. So while you aren\u2019t an AH for wanting to celebrate yourself on your own birthday, maybe you could have been more delicate in how you approached this. The fact that you weren\u2019t upfront with why you couldn\u2019t attend probably didn\u2019t help either.", "Sorry, YTA:\n-- A baby shower is an uncommon celebratory event, whereas your birthday does come every year.

You do realize that it's not actually *your* day, right? More than 17.5 million people celebrate the same day as their birthday. \n\n\n--As you've said, its not a milestone birthday. You could celebrate it a different day -- it's completely normal to celebrate your birthday on a different day (do you normally have your party the day of your birthday when it falls on a weekday?) \n\n\n--When you say you have plans, are you having a party? Have you sent out invites, made reservations somewhere, etc? Or is it just a normal get-together with friends where you'll be the center of attention? \n\n\n\n\n\nIt's perfectly fine to prioritize yourself, but realize that you are messaging that you think her (possibly once-in-a-lifetime) event is less important than your birthday.

While it's totally understandable for the friend to want to follow-up, as an adult she should understand that there are plenty of reasons ppl may not be able to attend her event. Instead of pushing for an answer, she should be content with a polite decline of an invitation and well-wishes sent her way.

It sounds like OP would have been willing to go if it was on another date, but it makes a lot of sense that ppl would want to celebrate their birthdays with friends.

After that, they've got it for later babies.\n\nBut it hasn't been that way for 30 years. Now it's a baby shower for each baby. Plus, possibly, a gender reveal party.

But actual friends are either straight up or polite in declining what is a big day for that person. She didn\u2019t do that. She won\u2019t be invited to anything else because she went down to avoidance/all about me route- real friends are worth more than a decline with no explanation", "That could be true, but it also could have been coincidental because of the friends schedule. We weren\u2019t given that much context besides they are longtime friends who now live far away from each other. It\u2019s all about mutual perspective.

You just want to be validated by everyone but maybe there\u2019s a chance to grow here and learn to  be a better friend? This friend is obviously not that important a friend and that\u2019s the end of it. But if my friend who I cared about rsvps no to my wedding without a reason I would ask why. And likewise if I couldn\u2019t make a wedding I would say why. Because communication is important to maintaining GOOD friendships.", "If my friend couldn\u2019t come and they were a long standing friend and I asked why and it was for their own party they organised after they got my invite I would be upset. Not about the baby shower element I just think your communication could have been nicer because now it\u2019s really obvious you didn\u2019t want to go and that will leave your friend wondering why.
