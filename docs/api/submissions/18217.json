If it's not allowed, I understand.\r  \n\r  \nI'm a tattoo artist and piercer. I co-own and run a tattoo/piercing business with a friend and I have many employees under me. We are open 6 days a week from 1PM to midnight. 4 days are a regular appointment schedule, while the final 2 days of the work week are walk-in days for people who want something faster than usual without having to set up a time. On top of setting up and closing the shop every day, I drive 45 minutes to work and then 45 minutes home each day. I get home past 3AM almost every night, eat, and then sleep a few hours. We are busy constantly throughout the week. I only have one day off and I usually end up spending it cleaning the house, cooking or doing anything else needed done.\r  \n\r  \nMy boyfriend, on the other hand, is trying to become a successful Twitch streamer and Youtuber. He started around 4 years ago. He has a few dozen followers on both platforms and usually has around 2 to 5 viewers for each stream or video. It's gotten pretty bad in the past 2 1/2 years or so though. He streams while I'm at work and that'll usually be an 11 to 13 hour stream a day depending on what he does. His life revolves around content creation now. He wakes up to stream, then spends all day streaming a game and then uploads it to Youtube. The other problem with it is that in the 4 years he's been trying to do this he hasn't worked a single job. He's unemployed. No single donation or any monetary expense has come from his endeavor. He literally does nothing but stream. He quit his floor manager job at Walmart to become this.\r  \n\r  \nI've talked to him recently about maybe cutting down the hours on his streams so he has time to do stuff around the house, spend time with me, or better his health. He doesn't even eat unless I remind him when I get home late. It's literally hurting him. I also explained that maybe he should think about getting a new job so I'm not the only one paying all the bills or groceries. I'd like help of any kind. I can't do all this alone anymore. Each one of these talks has turned into a fight between us. He will get super defensive about it and tell me off. He tries to convince me that I don't understand his \"lifestyle\" and that \"I don't know how hard it is to be a content creator\". It's gotten more and more heated. He'll have a tantrum and go back to streaming to his \"community that supports him\".\r  \n\r  \nThe other day, I straight up told him his dreams of being a successful streamer or content creator of any kind were never going to work out the way he thinks they are. He doesn't seem to understand that the hours he's putting in are doing more harm than good. For us and him. He had another tantrum, and promptly told me he wanted a break from the relationship. We aren't talking and now he's doing nothing but the same usual routine.

He's had time to lay the groundwork for his streaming career and it hasn't taken off, so you've been more than understanding. \n\nAT THE MINIMUM he needs to be taking care of himself and cleaning up the house if he's not going to be able to contribute to the household. Most streamers until they hit bigger numbers still have \"normal\" jobs and \"normal\" daytime routines. In fact I just watched a video from CC Suarez where she explicitly says **do not** quit your day job until you can support the lifestyle. Gaming streamers have created a massively diluted market and unless they have some kind of hook or incredibly entertaining streaming style/personality, it's going to be very hard to break through and find monetary success.\n\nWho's the owner of the home? If he wants a 'relationship break' then he needs to go do his own thing elsewhere. Otherwise I'd start charging him rent and if he can't pay (because no cashflow), then the hard truth is he'll have to leave.

Someone should tell him straight up, if you've been doing it for that long and you're not an affiliate yet, your content sucks. He doesn't need to spend every waking hour streaming. He just needs content people want and post it regularly. Honestly, you're better off living alone. He's going to leech off you, then, if he ever gets successful, he won't remember all the nice things you've done for him, and he'll disappear. Don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm. My mom used to do that, she died of breast cancer in January and she had nothing when she passed.", "NTA\n\nHe can have his own lifestyle when he can support it financially alone.

Let alone get a part time job? There\u2019s literally no compromise from him at all here from what you\u2019ve described, and I have to wonder why you\u2019re putting up with this. \n\nYou know you don\u2019t have to keep putting up with it, right?", "NTA At minimum he\u2019s gotta pay his bills.

The fact that he's this dedicated, this focused, means that this is become an obsession for him.  It's literally all he's got.

Ideally, he would too, but that's his problem, not yours.", "You might actually be doing him a favour then, getting him to get his act together by leaving", "It doesn\u2019t have to suck. Leave the relationship. You\u2019ve made it clear in your comments he sucks and doesn\u2019t do anything, there\u2019s no contribution. So\u2026. Leave? Why sit here and complain about something you can fix?", "Yeah. He doesn't sound well.", "You'd figure after years of trying, he'd figure out his formula isn't working. Really, with any type of new business, most of the successful ones can be emulated. I bet you he lashed out because he knows his shit sucks. And he's also upset that he knows he's failing. He's stuck in a sunken cost fallacy. He's invested too much time and won't cut his losses or change his formula.", "Who bought the games?", "Problem is he's far, far, far from being the only one doing that kind of thing online, especially after the lock down years when a lot of people took to streaming as a way to make a living in spite of the quarantine.\n\n20 years ago, it was new enough that anyone who started just streaming gaming online had a fighting chance. Nowadays, they also need to know how to do a lot of other things like online marketing, Search Engine Optimization and the likes, and he obviously has no idea how to do those, or even that he needs to know them.", "OP, it sounds like he's a video game addict covering it up with the \"becoming a content creator\" BS.  Anyone who has ever tried to make a living from social media knows the number one rule is to constantly review your content's appeal to your audience. Anyone doing it seriously would put out limited content, and constantly tweek what they put out to make sure it's getting attention. 4 years of doing this for under 50 followers?  Yeah he DGAF about content creation.  He wants an excuse for his addiction.", "It doesn't matter what he thinks he is qualified for if he can't prove it.", "Don't even try. That's HIS problem, not yours. Your problem is to stop enabling his leeching behavior.\n\nSo what you need to do is kick him to the curb and get yourself into therapy to avoid repeating YOUR behavior in your future relationships.", "I often say, you cannot force the eyes to see, the ears to hear or the heart to care. You have put it out there. That's all you are able to do. It's on him to take it and either run with it or run away. Right now, he's in limbo.\n\nNow, you need to remove him so you don't suffer further. He needs the reality check, and you need to heal yourself after 4 years of constant giving with no receiving.", "May I ask out of curiosity what kind of content he is streaming? Because like what shadowofthegrave said 4-5 viewers per stream is ridiculously low for being on the platform for so long. Is he just streaming game content with no commentary or doing something so boring that no one wants to watch the content?", "Too bad for him. He needs to leave. He\"s a freeloader.", "Ask his parents to come and get him. Tell them he's deteriorated and that you aren't taking responsibility for him anymore. Pack up his stuff. Don't let him take a car youre paying for.", "Sounds like a plan. He's already blaming you for eveything so you really don't have much to lose, except for the dead weight.", "Well acting like this, he shouldn\u2019t have a girlfriend anymore either tbh. (Or boyfriend, not sure you mentioned your gender.)", "If you cancel the house internet you could afford a mobile phone deal with unlimited internet and hotspot your devices off that, then he couldn\u2019t even switch it back on while you\u2019re at work \ud83d\ude09", "If you love him, you need to dump him. He won't ever get anywhere as long as he doesn't have to take responsibility for his life.\n\nI know it's hard, but it is the only way.", "The second he started the \u201cbreak\u201d in the relationship you should have made him leave/evict him. It is ridiculous that you let him stay. Make that break permanent!", "He can, or can't, but again it's not your problem. Your only problem is to find out what makes YOU keep enabling him, apart from stopping to do it ASAP.\n\nAgain, BTDT and it didn't get better, for either of us, until I opted out and forcefully broke the vicious circle we were stuck in.", "He's delusional, as are you if you continue to enable him. You aren't helping him by allowing him to continue his ridiculous fantasy, and it's clearly taking a toll on you.", "Look my kids want to be creators. Both stream on Twitch and other platforms. Guess what they go to school, do chores and stuff. My youngest is 21 and he would love to stream full time, but he also is majoring in computer science with a specialty in cyber security. He knows for quite a while streaming is his hobby and his career will allow him to cover his expenses plus upgrade everything to be a better streamer. My other son is on the spectrum and still manages to stream plus help with a ton of chores around the house.", "Well, then that's what you need to do.\n\nYou've been doing the same thing for 4 years, and it obviously is not working for either of you. What makes you think the results are going to change if you don't change the situation? \n\n\u201c The definition of insanity is doing the same thing. over and over again, but expecting different results\u201d \r  \n Albert Einstein.", ">He's still ~~living in the house.~~ mooching off me\n\nHere. I fixed it for you", "I really hope you ditch him. You\u2019re gonna find that your life is so much better without him. Like you can\u2019t even imagine now how much better you going to feel with him gone. It will feel like a weight is lifted off your shoulders that you didn\u2019t even know was there.", "Tons of streamers wont get anywhere.  It takes random good luck to break put off each tier and hes stuck and the lowest 2nd tier.  \n\nMore people in the world want to be some artist, celebrity or personality and theres not  enough people in the world to feed them all", "Lmao my bad, my app was a bit messed up earlier it would load the wrong things", "As one would say, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over again expecting different results. Your BF is clearly not changing a single thing and still expecting to make it big. At this point, if he doesn't change up what he's doing - cutting hours and doing things that promote his presence other than streaming - and you continue to support him, it'll be a long, vicious cycle. Please reconsider this relationship, especially if he's not contributing anything else to it.", "I'm not trying to imply you somehow weren't.  More trying to say that, as a peace offering, you'd lay off this subject for a while and continue to support (quite literally, you pay the bills!) his efforts.

You\u2019re literally keeping this word-stronger-than-parasite/freeloader/loser-needs-to-be-invented alive, and he\u2019s still hinging on it. If he remembered to exist and act outside of it this wouldn\u2019t be such a problem, but another commenter literally stated he would starve on stream if not for you. Forgetting to eat is a common indicator of a need for professional intervention.", "I know you've already had others say it but I genuinely think the relationship has run its course. Sit him down soon and tell him he needs to pack his things and leave. He's no longer an equal partner in your relationship and you can not afford to support both of you. He will likely try to convince you he can change but it's been 4 years, any changes that might happen will have to be funded by someone that isn't you. This is going to hurt because you still love him, but he's not a good partner to you and you need to be good to yourself.", "He provides nothing anymore.", "I do love him. I want to see him go far. It's just hard anymore. I'm tired.", "I do want happiness.", "That's all true.", "You are exactly right.", "Sadly for the most part, me.", "I'd prefer not to say haha.", "He also does NOTHING around the house. Zip, zilch, nada. He's a gamer boy who wants a mommy with benefits to look after him.", "True. But OP is also doing the same thing and expecting a different result. Somebody needs to break this vicious circle and we all know bf will not so OP has to do it by kicking him out.\n\nEdited typo", "He asked for some space. Give it to him. If his strategy is to force you to come crawling back to him because you love and miss him - let him see how that's a bad plan all around. \n\nCrickets. He wanted the space. He stopped speaking to you. So give him crickets and watch what he does - not listen to what he says when he finds out there is no crawling back to the BS he's been pulling.

He hasn\u2019t earned one red cent from it in four years.\n\nIt is not a job, it is a hobby.\n\nYou guys are on a break.

Stop this nonsense.", "This sounds heartbreaking and I\u2019m so sorry.\n\nIt will be hard to leave if you love him, but I agree that though Reddit tends to jump the gun on this stuff, this is a good case to leave. It\u2019s simply not sustainable for your mental health\u2014or his.\n\nYou sound like a lovely person, so I just wanted to add this: being kind to someone you love can sometimes mean cutting them off if that\u2019s what needed to stop enabling them. Because that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing right now. Like you said, it\u2019s hurting him. And though you mean well, your monetary support and care taking are allowing him to live like this. He needs a harsh reality check, which may or may not help him succeed but ultimately, you can\u2019t help him if he won\u2019t help himself.\n\nDo what you need to do for you, but know that in the end, you\u2019re also doing the only thing you can for him which is showing that his behavior isn\u2019t healthy, sustainable, or okay. Then it\u2019s up to him if he\u2019s willing to change it (or if he\u2019ll find another enabler to sustain this life but that\u2019s nothing you can change). It\u2019s not mean or unkind to leave him but the kindest thing you can do for him and yourself.\n\nGood luck and best wishes, whatever you decide to do \u2764\ufe0f", "You gave him four years of support financially, relationship wise and mentally. Many people start building a platform while working a full time job and then quit to pursue the work full time. Hell, some big big influencers still have a full time job, they just give you the illusion of doing this full time. \n\nIn truth, it is a hard job. That's why a lot of them take a mental health break at some point or bank content to be online and yet away or have assistants to help. \n\nThe truth is, if he has amassed only a couple dozen followers in four years,  he doesn't have a hook, a reason to stand out and he isn't doing what it takes, except to game for 12 hours a day, uninterrupted, and streaming it under the guise of being an influencer. \n\nTake the break,  but make sure that he understands that no relationship means roommates who handle their own stuff. He is on his own for laundry, cleaning, rent, maintenance,  cooking, etc. He may see the light quickly when he runs out of clean underwear and is starving because you haven't been his personal door dash for three days. Not to mention when he realizes he painted himself into this corner, he will get angry, so you may need to evict him when you come to terms with completely breaking off the relationship.  I say this gently, but I think you're in love with the person he was, not who he is. You seem to be smart and motivated to rock this business, him, not so much. \n\nI say NTA and I hope you share an update. You deserve better.", "May I ask: what do you CURRENTLY actually \"love\" about him? Not what you used to love when you first met. Right now. He seems to not even really be in the relationship, and doesn't particularly strike me as introspective. He also seems to have a bit of a self-centered approach to life, which is going to make his dream of streaming impossible. You have to be conscientious of your AUDIENCE (\"the other\") in order to build out and adapt. He just sounds like he wants to do what he wants and somehow magically also get paid for it. Real popular streamers put in A METRIC TON of time and effort, above and beyond what they are actually streaming. 13 hour sessions are absurd. \n\nHe doesn't have the character traits, nor the life interests really, that are typically required of both his dream, and of maintaining any semblance of a healthy relationship.\n\nThere is a LOT of work he needs to do. Things don't just magically happen. And just based on him \"tantruming\" but still benefiting from staying at, essentially, mom's house? Come on. Is he like 15? It's juvenile, and that's the absolute most clement term I can use. NTA, but you are likely worth a lot more than you give yourself credit for here.", "If you want him to go far, stop enabling him by supporting him. Ask him to move out and if he refuses, then you move. Let him know that if he gets his shit together in the next 6 months you would consider taking him back. You are not doing him any good by allowing him to do nothing all day. Everyone needs to be able to function as an adult. He is not doing this because you enable him to be a bum.\n\nI personally would move on and find someone that is an actual grown up, but if you can find good in him that is your choice.", "That's not love.  Sure, you care about him and want to see him do well because you are good person.  But if it comes at a cost to your emotional and physical well being, it's not love but some kind of co-dependency.
