If it's not allowed, I understand.\r  \n\r  \nI'm a tattoo artist and piercer. I co-own and run a tattoo/piercing business with a friend and I have many employees under me. We are open 6 days a week from 1PM to midnight. 4 days are a regular appointment schedule, while the final 2 days of the work week are walk-in days for people who want something faster than usual without having to set up a time. On top of setting up and closing the shop every day, I drive 45 minutes to work and then 45 minutes home each day. I get home past 3AM almost every night, eat, and then sleep a few hours. We are busy constantly throughout the week. I only have one day off and I usually end up spending it cleaning the house, cooking or doing anything else needed done.\r  \n\r  \nMy boyfriend, on the other hand, is trying to become a successful Twitch streamer and Youtuber. He started around 4 years ago. He has a few dozen followers on both platforms and usually has around 2 to 5 viewers for each stream or video. It's gotten pretty bad in the past 2 1/2 years or so though. He streams while I'm at work and that'll usually be an 11 to 13 hour stream a day depending on what he does. His life revolves around content creation now. He wakes up to stream, then spends all day streaming a game and then uploads it to Youtube. The other problem with it is that in the 4 years he's been trying to do this he hasn't worked a single job. He's unemployed. No single donation or any monetary expense has come from his endeavor. He literally does nothing but stream. He quit his floor manager job at Walmart to become this.\r  \n\r  \nI've talked to him recently about maybe cutting down the hours on his streams so he has time to do stuff around the house, spend time with me, or better his health. He doesn't even eat unless I remind him when I get home late. It's literally hurting him. I also explained that maybe he should think about getting a new job so I'm not the only one paying all the bills or groceries. I'd like help of any kind. I can't do all this alone anymore. Each one of these talks has turned into a fight between us. He will get super defensive about it and tell me off. He tries to convince me that I don't understand his \"lifestyle\" and that \"I don't know how hard it is to be a content creator\". It's gotten more and more heated. He'll have a tantrum and go back to streaming to his \"community that supports him\".\r  \n\r  \nThe other day, I straight up told him his dreams of being a successful streamer or content creator of any kind were never going to work out the way he thinks they are. He doesn't seem to understand that the hours he's putting in are doing more harm than good. For us and him. He had another tantrum, and promptly told me he wanted a break from the relationship. We aren't talking and now he's doing nothing but the same usual routine.

Hobbies dont pay the bills.", "NTA - he's not your boyfriend, he's your dependent. And of the \"moody teenager\" variety from the sounds of it.", "4 years, OP???\n\nOkay you've been pretty patient. He's had time to lay the groundwork for his streaming career and it hasn't taken off, so you've been more than understanding. \n\nAT THE MINIMUM he needs to be taking care of himself and cleaning up the house if he's not going to be able to contribute to the household. Most streamers until they hit bigger numbers still have \"normal\" jobs and \"normal\" daytime routines. In fact I just watched a video from CC Suarez where she explicitly says **do not** quit your day job until you can support the lifestyle. Gaming streamers have created a massively diluted market and unless they have some kind of hook or incredibly entertaining streaming style/personality, it's going to be very hard to break through and find monetary success.\n\nWho's the owner of the home? If he wants a 'relationship break' then he needs to go do his own thing elsewhere. Otherwise I'd start charging him rent and if he can't pay (because no cashflow), then the hard truth is he'll have to leave.

Someone should tell him straight up, if you've been doing it for that long and you're not an affiliate yet, your content sucks. He doesn't need to spend every waking hour streaming. He just needs content people want and post it regularly. Honestly, you're better off living alone. He's going to leech off you, then, if he ever gets successful, he won't remember all the nice things you've done for him, and he'll disappear. Don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm. My mom used to do that, she died of breast cancer in January and she had nothing when she passed.", "NTA\n\nHe can have his own lifestyle when he can support it financially alone.

Let alone get a part time job? There\u2019s literally no compromise from him at all here from what you\u2019ve described, and I have to wonder why you\u2019re putting up with this. \n\nYou know you don\u2019t have to keep putting up with it, right?", "NTA At minimum he\u2019s gotta pay his bills. You\u2019re subsidizing him and he\u2019s made no progress. And he\u2019s not pulling his weight as a partner or a roommate. If he wants a break from the relationship he should move out.

In fact, everyone, go out and find someone who needs to hear that, because there's too many of em.", "NTA\n\nMaybe he is on to something.

The fact that he's this dedicated, this focused, means that this is become an obsession for him.  It's literally all he's got.

But love alone does not equal to a successful relationship. Currently he provides NOTHING to the table, not even affection. He is sacrificing everything for his addiction\u2026 So my advice is give him his break, but make a point of him moving away for the time being. Honestly he needs help with his addiction, but unless he sees that for himself there\u2019s really nothing you could do. So by giving him his \u201cbreak\u201d you\u2019re basically forcing him out of his addiction and face the reality of the situation.

I have a full time Job too), your boyfriend needs a reality check. \n\nThe amount of creators that make it big is a fraction of the number of people trying and while some of it is networking, so much if it is luck, right time, right place, sorta luck. And I'm sorry, but if He has \"a couple dozen\" followers after 4 years, he's never gonna get more. I have almost 500 after 2, some times with a handful of viewers a stream, more often between 10 and 20, with occasional spikes up to 40 because of the friends I have made sending their people to me, or hitting the right game at the right time (which is rare, I play things I love and people like the energy and vibes that brings, I don't try to chase the next big thing) \n\nBut all that aside, if we are talking cash money, I make about $40 a month on patreon and anywhere from $50-$300 a month on Twitch. And I stream 4 days every week. With rotating games on 2 days and the same game on 2 days.  Unless I'm doing a super special event, I stream 3 hours Tuesdays, 3 hours on  Thursdays,  4-6 hours on Friday and Saturday. Sure, it can be a lot, but it's rewarding because I enjoy it. I never set out to make money, and my goal has never been to \"be a creator\" my goal was to share stuff i love with the internet and build small safe corner for LGBT people to find connections.\n\nBeing blunt here, your boyfriend is a failure at this, and it's clear he will never succeed. If he ever actually made friends and networked with other even remotely successful  people, he would have been told that he is going about this all wrong and wasting his time. Then again, he sounds like someone who WAS told that and ignored it.  The thing is, people can smell the desperation of wanna be \"creators\" that  only do it cause they want money. And I'll admit, being a trans woman has helped if only because there are so few of us that have streaming communities that being found by people looking for that is easier. Your boyfriend sounds like every other white bread dude bro on the internet who just wants money with no work and wayched hours of \"how to be a streamer\" youtube dudes who dont actually stream and are just in the business of faking it so people like your boyfriend get sucked into giving them momey for \"tips\", and that crowd is so overfilled that no one cares about another dude in the line up.", "NTA, and honey, get him OUT.

Charge him rent. Even in the relationship, at some point you are done supporting him playing video games all day and he doesn't get to leech off you.

Let him live independently, do his own dishes, own laundry, etc. and let him see how hard it is to literally carry everything by himself. Let him know that that's what you've been going through.", "Even kids have to do something, like chores. And can even cook something.", "Good job! So happy for you!", "Good on you.", "Wonderful!", "Happy that you\u2019re able to move on. Sucks that you have to lose someone you care about though. He\u2019s going to realize what he lost shortly after he leaves, I bet.", "Turn off the Wifi. You're paying for it.", "You will not change him and he is not going to change.", "Honestly ya should let his parents know that this is what he doing, warn them before you kick him out because he is absolutely delusional. \n\nSure I get he is trying to make it in a harsh market that has a very high pay ceiling but he has made nothing in 4 years, he is no different from a guy staying in his parents basement and playing videogames. \n\nIts the sad through but similarly not actors make it... sure he might but 4 years without any income? common..", "That still goes with the sentence stop living with him ala kick him out.", "Incredibly low, after 4 years. Maybe he has no interest in self-promotion. He might have,  \"if \"I\" play it, they will come\" mentality. Possibly even putting down his viewers or kicking anyone out of his stream, who does something he doesn't approve of. \n\nI started streaming after work for about 4 or 5 hours (longer on weekends) for about a month or so. I had 10-15 consistent viewers after about week 3. I had no cam, and not many people in the chat were talking. I got most of them from self-promotion. Talking to people in the community and posting my stream where I could (not spamming in other channels). Getting friends to watch.\n\nLike most of the comments here. I dont believe he wants to make a living streaming. After 4 years, he could find more than 5 people to join his stream. He wants a free ride so he can play games all day.\n\nGood luck to you OP. If you decide to kick him out, hopefully, he leaves without a fight. You sound like a kind person with motivation. I'm sure you will find someone new, like-minded, who you can build a life with.", "Let us know how it goes, good luck OP!!", "He\u2019s 100% a teenage boy taking advantage of \u201cmommy\u201d. \n\nNo job, no bills, no responsibilities, a clearly not working out pipe dream. Get rid of the dead weight.", "But he\u2019s not OP\u2019s child\u2026\nThat\u2019s a pretty substantial distinction here."]}
