If it's not allowed, I understand.\r  \n\r  \nI'm a tattoo artist and piercer. I co-own and run a tattoo/piercing business with a friend and I have many employees under me. We are open 6 days a week from 1PM to midnight. 4 days are a regular appointment schedule, while the final 2 days of the work week are walk-in days for people who want something faster than usual without having to set up a time. On top of setting up and closing the shop every day, I drive 45 minutes to work and then 45 minutes home each day. I get home past 3AM almost every night, eat, and then sleep a few hours. We are busy constantly throughout the week. I only have one day off and I usually end up spending it cleaning the house, cooking or doing anything else needed done.\r  \n\r  \nMy boyfriend, on the other hand, is trying to become a successful Twitch streamer and Youtuber. He started around 4 years ago. He has a few dozen followers on both platforms and usually has around 2 to 5 viewers for each stream or video. It's gotten pretty bad in the past 2 1/2 years or so though. He streams while I'm at work and that'll usually be an 11 to 13 hour stream a day depending on what he does. His life revolves around content creation now. He wakes up to stream, then spends all day streaming a game and then uploads it to Youtube. The other problem with it is that in the 4 years he's been trying to do this he hasn't worked a single job. He's unemployed. No single donation or any monetary expense has come from his endeavor. He literally does nothing but stream. He quit his floor manager job at Walmart to become this.\r  \n\r  \nI've talked to him recently about maybe cutting down the hours on his streams so he has time to do stuff around the house, spend time with me, or better his health. He doesn't even eat unless I remind him when I get home late. It's literally hurting him. I also explained that maybe he should think about getting a new job so I'm not the only one paying all the bills or groceries. I'd like help of any kind. I can't do all this alone anymore. Each one of these talks has turned into a fight between us. He will get super defensive about it and tell me off. He tries to convince me that I don't understand his \"lifestyle\" and that \"I don't know how hard it is to be a content creator\". It's gotten more and more heated. He'll have a tantrum and go back to streaming to his \"community that supports him\".\r  \n\r  \nThe other day, I straight up told him his dreams of being a successful streamer or content creator of any kind were never going to work out the way he thinks they are. He doesn't seem to understand that the hours he's putting in are doing more harm than good. For us and him. He had another tantrum, and promptly told me he wanted a break from the relationship. We aren't talking and now he's doing nothing but the same usual routine.

He's had time to lay the groundwork for his streaming career and it hasn't taken off, so you've been more than understanding. \n\nAT THE MINIMUM he needs to be taking care of himself and cleaning up the house if he's not going to be able to contribute to the household. Most streamers until they hit bigger numbers still have \"normal\" jobs and \"normal\" daytime routines. In fact I just watched a video from CC Suarez where she explicitly says **do not** quit your day job until you can support the lifestyle. Gaming streamers have created a massively diluted market and unless they have some kind of hook or incredibly entertaining streaming style/personality, it's going to be very hard to break through and find monetary success.\n\nWho's the owner of the home? If he wants a 'relationship break' then he needs to go do his own thing elsewhere. Otherwise I'd start charging him rent and if he can't pay (because no cashflow), then the hard truth is he'll have to leave.

Someone should tell him straight up, if you've been doing it for that long and you're not an affiliate yet, your content sucks. He doesn't need to spend every waking hour streaming. He just needs content people want and post it regularly. Honestly, you're better off living alone. He's going to leech off you, then, if he ever gets successful, he won't remember all the nice things you've done for him, and he'll disappear. Don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm. My mom used to do that, she died of breast cancer in January and she had nothing when she passed.", "NTA\n\nHe can have his own lifestyle when he can support it financially alone.

Let alone get a part time job? There\u2019s literally no compromise from him at all here from what you\u2019ve described, and I have to wonder why you\u2019re putting up with this. \n\nYou know you don\u2019t have to keep putting up with it, right?", "NTA At minimum he\u2019s gotta pay his bills.

The fact that he's this dedicated, this focused, means that this is become an obsession for him.  It's literally all he's got.

But love alone does not equal to a successful relationship. Currently he provides NOTHING to the table, not even affection. He is sacrificing everything for his addiction\u2026 So my advice is give him his break, but make a point of him moving away for the time being. Honestly he needs help with his addiction, but unless he sees that for himself there\u2019s really nothing you could do. So by giving him his \u201cbreak\u201d you\u2019re basically forcing him out of his addiction and face the reality of the situation.

I have a full time Job too), your boyfriend needs a reality check. \n\nThe amount of creators that make it big is a fraction of the number of people trying and while some of it is networking, so much if it is luck, right time, right place, sorta luck. And I'm sorry, but if He has \"a couple dozen\" followers after 4 years, he's never gonna get more. I have almost 500 after 2, some times with a handful of viewers a stream, more often between 10 and 20, with occasional spikes up to 40 because of the friends I have made sending their people to me, or hitting the right game at the right time (which is rare, I play things I love and people like the energy and vibes that brings, I don't try to chase the next big thing) \n\nBut all that aside, if we are talking cash money, I make about $40 a month on patreon and anywhere from $50-$300 a month on Twitch. And I stream 4 days every week. With rotating games on 2 days and the same game on 2 days.  Unless I'm doing a super special event, I stream 3 hours Tuesdays, 3 hours on  Thursdays,  4-6 hours on Friday and Saturday. Sure, it can be a lot, but it's rewarding because I enjoy it. I never set out to make money, and my goal has never been to \"be a creator\" my goal was to share stuff i love with the internet and build small safe corner for LGBT people to find connections.\n\nBeing blunt here, your boyfriend is a failure at this, and it's clear he will never succeed. If he ever actually made friends and networked with other even remotely successful  people, he would have been told that he is going about this all wrong and wasting his time. Then again, he sounds like someone who WAS told that and ignored it.  The thing is, people can smell the desperation of wanna be \"creators\" that  only do it cause they want money. And I'll admit, being a trans woman has helped if only because there are so few of us that have streaming communities that being found by people looking for that is easier. Your boyfriend sounds like every other white bread dude bro on the internet who just wants money with no work and wayched hours of \"how to be a streamer\" youtube dudes who dont actually stream and are just in the business of faking it so people like your boyfriend get sucked into giving them momey for \"tips\", and that crowd is so overfilled that no one cares about another dude in the line up.", "NTA, and honey, get him OUT.

It's pretty much the extent of my social life outside of my wife and kids for the last 20yrs. All the money goes towards equipment, gas or food so everyone can do it for free.\n\nHe needs to grow the fuck up and face reality.", "WHY tho??", "super hot, right??", "I'm sorry, I don't understand why you want to support him. It's hard for me to see your POV on this. To the rest of us he sounds pretty pathetic. When you look at him, are you seeing the reality of his actions and their consequences, or are you seeing a fantasy of what you hope he could become?  \n\n\nBecause I know you care about him, let me put it this way: if you're always looking at your partner through the lens of what they *could* become, that's not love, or respect, or appreciation. Love means loving someone for who they really are. It's better for both of you if you bow out.", "You're not supporting him you're enabling him", "Honey, you \\*need\\* to dump and legally evict this person. He's literally costing you money and energy that could be put to better use.", "Time to start eviction proceedings, however that looks where you live.", "Did the pandemic grew his view counts at all?", "If you own the house and car\u2026This is difficult but you need to break up with him and kick him out. \n\nThis relationship is not serving you. At all. He brings nothing to the table and is only a burden. You\u2019re functioning as his mother at this point, and you deserve a strong, independent partner who loves you - a relationship in which you take care of each other. Not this one-sided bullshit.\n\nAnd as you mentioned, this lifestyle is also terrible for your boyfriend\u2026.\n\nYou\u2019re gonna have to force him into making a change. It sounds like the only way to do that is to cut him off completely. Maybe one day he\u2019ll even thank you for it.", "Hitting a wall would imply that he ever had momentum.  He never started.\n\nBeing a successful content creator means having content people want to watch.  A dozen or two followers, and 4 or 5 viewers on each stream means he does not.  He needs to add at least two zeros to each of those numbers before he can even think this is serious.  The fact that he has not made a single cent on it only illustrates that.\n\nHeck, even a musician trying to break into the music scene can get a couple bucks in pity money from strangers by sitting on a corner and playing.  He isn't even managing that.\n\nOP, I would set a limit for him.  Tell him he needs to contribute at least X percent towards the monthly bills (I would go no lower than 25%).  How he earns that money can be up to him - if he can (somehow) find a way to get a revenue stream from his content, fine.  But if it continues to be a zero income source, he needs to pick up a job in the meantime until he gets his \"big break\".  He needs to pull at least some of his weight.  If he is unwilling to contribute even 25% to the bills, inform him it is time he thinks about finding a new place to live.  (Maybe give him a little lead time - \"Within the next two months, you need to be able to help pay some of our costs of living here.  If you can't, or won't, help pay by then, you will need to move out.\"", "Your happiness matters, your peace matters, you don't seem to matter to him..", "He is going to blame you regardless.  That\u2019s what people with zero accountability and zero self awareness do.  All you have control over is you, your actions, your decisions, your happiness. If his choice is to sabotage his well-being and his relationship for some half baked career aspirations, that\u2019s outside of your control but you certainly can wish him well and send him on his way.  It will be hard and he will be hateful and ugly about it but in the long run, you\u2019ll ask yourself why you didn\u2019t do it sooner.  \n\nPartners PARTNER.  He\u2019s not a good friend or partner to you. Please love yourself more than you love him and do what you know is right.", "Then go get some! You say you love him, but what about him do you actually love? I mean like right now, not the \"oh well he was perfect at the start\" kind of answer. Right now today, what do you actually love about him that only he can give you? From what you've said he gives you nothing. \nYou're in a rut with this absolute waste of space trash human. He is manipulating you, in to being his mummy. You want to be his mummy? Is that the life you want? Yo udo deserve happiness, but you gotta ditch this AH to get it.", "don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm!", "For a spiteful person sure, I agree with everyone kick him out", "I would be shocked if he wasn't depressed. This kind of behavior is largely a coping mechanism. Even if that's not the case, the alternatives (addiction, delusional, etc.) also really require professional intervention.", "For both your sakes, then, it sounds like it should happen now rather than continuing to drag this out.", "i second this. You would be doing in him favor. He needs to learn that he needs to take care of himself or remember what its like to do that. He has the experience to go get a job and pay for his own bills because I'm guessing he did when he worked at Walmart as manager?", "This is a good assessment.", "It's legit branding. He sounds like he doesn't have a niche and is not charming enough to just play games. It's definitely do able but he clearly doesn't know what his audience wants. I had a friend who started just playing games but found that when he would open packs of cards on one of the Fifa games, he'd get hundreds of views. So he focused on that and started making a killing. He stopped because he said, it became too much of a job lol. Go figure haha.", "Take a look at my other comment. You're not wrong but it's even worse, I don't do search engine optimization, or like,  real marketing and I do it as a side gig to a 40hr a week office job, and for WAY less time per stream and per week than this loser and while im Not wildly successful, I might as well be the hottest shit in existence next to this guy.", "The guy you fell in love with is not the guy you're living with now. This is a different person. Would you have fallen in love with this person?", "Wdym by anymore? What did he do before? What did he contribute before? How long has this been his only work? Did he support you when you started tatting?", "If you are giving each other space or on a break, you're now roommates - outline for him the billing schedule and what his half of the living expenses are. Rent is due on the 1st, power is due on the 15th, internet is due on x, so forth and so on with any services you both share. Do it in writing, document it all, start with the paper trail. I wouldn't be surprised if you end up having to evict this loser through the courts, since you know he isn't getting a job to pay for anything.", "Well that's your answer then. NTA.  You can't force others to love you and treat you the way you deserve. They either do or thay don't.", "Sooo do you realize that every time he yells or screams you back down and he basically gets his way until you bring it up again.  Its perfect...almost tactic like.\n\nHe can probably do that all day, every day.  Why not?  He's not being held accountable, has a free roof over his head, a free bed to sleep in and free food to eat all under the comfort of an air conditioned/heated home that he isn't being made to pay for.  Why not manipulate to keep that sweet setup?\n\nOP when are you going to get sick and tired of this?  I guarantee you're not because he's still there, doing what he's doing.   You're not acting because you're in love???  How's that working out?  Clearly your love isn't enough of an incentive for him to get a job to help out.  But you're doing a great job of enabling this lazy, unmotivated, self centered ah to keep being just that.", "You can support and encourage him in his dreams, AND be realistic about needing him to contribute financially and with emotional and physical labor around the house. These tasks should not and cannot solely fall to one member of the household. The current set-up is entirely inequitable. \n\nOfc he's going to be pissed about any suggestions for change. He's got a sweet-ass set-up RN where he gets to engage in his hobby all day and literally contribute nothing. But it's time to stop enabling him. If he has a problem with contributing his fair share to the household he does not respect you or value your time and energy. And that's really telling.", "Please don\u2019t hurt yourself for his sake. This situation sounds exhausting and you deserve to be in a fulfilling relationship.", "Hes not going anywhere but a job at walmart or  mooching off you. Move on from the bum", "Honey, ask yourself - what would be missing in your life if he was gone?", "OP, it's fine to love someone but you have to love yourself too. Loving him at the expense of your health and happiness isn't good for you. No sense drowning to keep someone who doesn't really care about you afloat.\n\nLearn to separate \"I want the best for them\" from \"this no longer serves my best interest\". Wish him good luck with his dream and love him from elsewhere. \n\nNTA.", ">I want to see him go far\n\nSure, but that isn't going to happen. Not only has he made no advancement in almost 5 years, he now has a gap of 5 years that cannot be justified to an employer. \n\nEven if he were well educated and could get a job in a specialized field (sounds like that's a no anyway) that 5 years is going to tank him, he's entry level at best. Even if he went back to Walmart he's not going to be a supervisor.\n\nIt sucks when you love someone but at this point he is dead weight that's dragging you down and you need to cut the string tying you together before it drowns you.", "You cannot fix him.  \n\nYou can love someone but not be with them anymore.", "so my roommate\u2019s best friend recently broke up with her boyfriend who she didn\u2019t live with, but is the exact type of person you\u2019ve described.\n\nbeen unemployed for much longer than any self respecting adult should be. plays video games for an unhealthy amount of time. smokes weed all day.\n\nwhat she\u2019s really struggling with now is the realization that for the past year she\u2019s been wasting her time on a guy who\u2019s frankly, a loser with nothing going on him, and the embarrassment that comes with it.\n\nthis fella you\u2019re with is a loser who games all day and you don\u2019t have to settle for that", "Do you honestly think he can change at this point? He\u2019s completely taking advantage of you, your labor, you money. I don\u2019t get how you\u2019ve let this go on for so long.", "He\u2019s not \u201cworking to become a content creator.\u201d He\u2019s living the dream life of a teenage boy. You house him, feed him when you get home at 3am, and I suppose probably have sex with him sometimes. Do you see that? It\u2019s permanent summer vacation with a bang maid. He\u2019s explicitly taking advantage of you. I\u2019m sorry.", "YTA for enabling this behavior.", "It feels like he never found anything his audience did want. It also feels like he's not teachable and not ready to listen to anything anyone tells him, not even the few people who watch him. That's a lose-lose situation in my book.\n\nTell your friend that yes, people who are ral successful at that work an anwful lot, just like anyone with a J O B LOL", "Prefer not to say your gender ? Are you one of the made up ones ? I\u2019m a black lesbian nice to meet you", "Not even just a hobby, an addiction. He needs reminded to eat. He doesn't do anything else. He's oblivious that his \"lifestyle\" has to be materially supported, and if treated as a business, profitable, and is a net negative to everything else in his life. There is no everything else to him, just the flashing lights and dopamine hits and threats to getting more of it. He's more than a hobbyist, he's an addict.", "Seriously, this. OP, you deserve so much better, but I understand how hard it can be to center our own worth and needs when it comes at the expense of someone we love.\n\nHowever, he has asked you for space. The most respectful thing you can do would be to honor his request. Give him tons of space. You'll find that it benefits you, too.", "4 years and still not being able to gain any monetary value from it. Sounds like a hobby to me. Hobbies dont pay the bills.", ">He asked for some space. Give it to him.\n\nOutside of you home.", "He thinks he's going to be the next Mr. Beast lol.", "right i know people who could reliably get 8k views for a video and had to suppliment their income with other jobs, he's not even getting that", "oh i like that. 'well you pay for it honey and it goes on.\"", "YES TURN OFF THE INTERNET", "You don\u2019t have to do this, just change the password and don\u2019t give it to him.
