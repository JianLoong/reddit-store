I don't know her boyfriend well, but we have had only positive or neutral interactions in the past, which is why this is kind of weird. I said hi, but I didn't really look up from what I was doing because I was trying to focus.\n\nThey went into the kitchen for a little and then he came out with a drink and asked what I was doing. I explained that I was putting together a table. He bent down and picked up a bag of screws. I said, not in a confrontational tone of voice, \"oh, don't touch those. I have everything organized.\"\n\nHe put them down and I continued what I was doing. I put the instruction booklet down and screwed in a piece. While I was doing so, he picked up the instruction book. This annoyed me. When I finished screwing the piece in I said I needed the book back. He asked if I wanted help. I said no, just the book.\n\nHe said \"I can read the steps to you. Or you can read the steps and I'll put the pieces together for you.\" I said \"or I can read the steps and put the pieces together. I can also walk and chew gum at the same time, too. Give me the book back.\"\n\nHe said that it \"looked complicated.\" At this point, I was really annoyed, because I hate being interrupted when I'm focusing on something, and now I've completely lost my train of thought. So I said \"well, it isn't. Now kindly fuck off.\"\n\nHe put the book down and walked away. He and my roommate went to her room and hung out. I finished what I was doing and then went to my room. After he left, my roommate asked me what happened. She said \"you never go from 0 to 60 like that, what the hell?\" I told her I just got irritated. She said it was an asshole move because her BF was just trying to be helpful. I get that, but I didn't need or what help.

The 3rd part was a comment about how it looked complicated he did not ask if she wanted help again and she was again rude. So at what point was she kind? The one time she said no.
