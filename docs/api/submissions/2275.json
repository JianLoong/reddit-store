And frankly just weird behavior, who does that? He barely even knows OP. It\u2019s also certainly neither polite nor helpful.", "How is her telling the truth snarky?  Like, that is as straightforward as can be.  That was literally ALL she needed and he took it from her without asking her.", "How is gender a factor?", "He was the one being an asshole about it, I don't know about you, but I learned in preschool not to just grab other people's things. \n\nShe was in the middle of working on something, and he came up and grabbed her stuff slowing her down and preventing her from continuing her work until he gave it back. \n\nThat is PRIME asshole behavior.  But how dare she get annoyed with someone getting under foot and slowing her down.", "I don't trust the pink tools. I assume they're not built as well as the regular ones. I understand I could be wrong, but that's my opinion.", "Yeah my dad was really great. He could fix literally anything. He let me sit and watch and try. I can fix my car and renovate my house with yt diy videos now cause he said I can do anything if I just use common sense.", "I once dated the guy who asked me who put up the shelves on my wall. I said me of course. He thought I would have had a previous boyfriend put them up for me. Sir, I own several power tools and have fixed my own sink.", "Lol!", "If you reckon a tractor's a man magnet wait til you see how many an excavator can dig up!(pun intended)", "Right!?! I never see those guys when I am working! I can even pretend I'm a helpless girl who needs a big, strong male savior if it makes them feel better! I'll even make sandwiches! Just give me a hand with this damn renovation, I'm tired of doing it all on my own, and by now, the hard and important stuff is done anyway, so no possibility to screw it up \ud83d\ude02", "One time a random guy on the curb tried to help me pull into a parking spot by making hand gestures like he was directing air traffic. Like thank you, I can park just fine lol must be something in their brains", "Thank you!", "*\"Oh hey you're putting together furniture, you need any help?\"*\n\n*\"Nah I'm good.\"*\n\n*\"Alright, hit me up if you change your mind I'll be hanging out with <Roommate>\"* \n\nThat's all he needed to do, not grab at her shit and be annoying.  And yet all these people are bending over backwards to defend him because... Idk, reasons?", "Some aren't built as well, but some are just scaled down so they fit smaller hands better.", "I got a black and pink 25 piece tool set from aldi for something ridiculous like $20 about 5 years ago and it's brilliant! Maybe that's because it's just pink trim though?", "Yeah I do the same, always buy men's work shirts and boots too.", "When I was a tradesman I plastidipped the handles of all my tools pink, it stopped all the guys from borrowing them", "I have the same one and my skills have transformed into something of excellence ever since! ;)", "If you truly are a women, then you surely must understand the frustration of our \"No's\" not being taken seriously. Surely you must be upset that we women are expected to constantly be nice and say no repeatedly with a happy and pleasant tone or else we are accused of being mean. Surely you would support a woman standing up for herself after a man refused to repeatedly act accept her no. I'm sure you agree that people need to learn that when a woman says no, they need to accept her no and if they get their feelings hurt, it's their fault for not listening. Surely, you, a woman, will  agree with me, another woman.", "I\u2019m sure you understand that asking to help someone is not the same as asking to fuck them and deserve different responses. Ya\u2019ll are trying to equate this to something way bigger and it\u2019s showing how bad you want to play the victim. Nothing insane was done to her. And I hope you\u2019re being sarcastic when you say I have to agree with you because i\u2019m a woman. It sounds sarcastic and hypocritical so ima take it that way.", "The context DOES NOT matter. OP SAID NO. That's it. The fact that you're still arguing about how OP is the bad guy for establishing her No, when someone refused to listen. When someone says No, you accept their NO. You don't keep pushing and then cry because they weren't coddling their feelings while they ignored you repeatedly. And the fact you're calling HER \"playing the victim\" because she dared say *No* makes you sound like a \"pick me girl\" or you're a man faking being a woman."]}
