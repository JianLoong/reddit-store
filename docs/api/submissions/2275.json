I was 23, pregnant, and  desperately wanted a BBQ hot dog, so I bought and assembled the grill.   My kids and I assembled the book cases.    So when the EX got mad about the grill, I remind him of the time he went to trim the  hedges, first he cut his finger, then he cut the cord.  He went to light the furnace, and blew it up. .....

He owes you an apology for interrupting, for moving things he had no reason to touch and for assuming you wanted or even needed his help.  His behavior was sexist and derogatory.  Don\u2019t tell her you just got irritated, tell her exactly why you got irritated, each treating you like an inept idiot thing he did that caused your reaction.

He wants to \"help\". So we usually end up trying to find things for him to do that won't get in the way and have to clean up the aftermath later.
