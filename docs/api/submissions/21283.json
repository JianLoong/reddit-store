In the past, my mother has repeatedly stolen money from my father and screwed us over, always chose men over her children, and was a very abusive alcoholic. \n\nMy amazing father, unfortunately, passed away last week due to cancer. One of his dying wishes was for me to continue living here and finish school. My parents never officially got divorced, and my dad made her executor of his Will. Before he died, I told him my feelings about how I don\u2019t trust my mother to follow through on her promises, especially knowing her history. \n\nWell after his death a week ago, my mom suspiciously calls me all excited and tells me about how she is going to work extra hours to get me my dream apartment and cover the costs. She starts telling our whole family and all of our close friends about how she is going to cover all my expenses and support me entirely while I finish school.\n\n Something is clearly suspicious here due to the fact that she would go out of her way to come up with an extra thousand for me to live in my own place in my dream city. I declined and told her that I would be staying at the home that my dad wanted me to continue living in. Her reaction to my decision seemed very off, and I could tell she was hiding something.\n\nSo I decided to stay home in my room while she came here to work on our home after my father\u2019s death. She had no clue that I was there as I made sure to be very quiet. Thank god I did. I found out her entire deliberate plan and what a trap it is. My mom and stepdad talked all about how they really needed to get my other family members to convince me to take that apartment. My stepdad told my mom, \u201cWe\u2019ll stop paying after a few months and then she\u2019ll be completely on her own.\u201d My mom responded \u201cI know, but we\u2019re not going to tell her that. If we told her that, she would panic.\u201d \n\nBy getting me out of this home, they\u2019ll benefit because they\u2019ll be able to rent the whole place out for more, rather than just separate rooms. \nBoth of them know that I could never find an apartment that is as good of a deal as my dad\u2019s place. If I were to get all the amenities that I have here but at an apartment, it would be at least two thousand more per month. My mom was offering to get me a studio apartment, which starts at $2,400 around here. There is no way I could ever afford that as a student. They both know that I\u2019d eventually have nowhere to go and be forced to live out of my car while putting myself through school. \n\nAITA for calling her out and wanting to cut ties with her? I called her out yesterday for everything. I also told her that under no circumstances will I be moving\u2026let\u2019s see if she takes me to eviction court. \nShe is playing victim to my whole family and telling all of them that I\u2019m just making things up.", "created_utc": 1688455710, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14q85eo/aita_for_not_wanting_to_have_a_relationship_with/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If there is a very good claim, including an estate with cash assets, they may agree to pursue action on a payment plan. But if the source of any recovery is the house, that means it has to be sold.\n\nOP's first step is to send a letter requesting a copy of the will and any estate plan (like a trust). The executor owes fiduciary duties of good faith fair dealing and providing full documentation is part of that duty.\n\nIf there is evidence of Mother's bad intent, then OP may have grounds for objecting to Mother being named executor.\n\nOP should reach out to the local Bar Association for referrals to probate specialists."]}
