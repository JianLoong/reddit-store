I get you have strong principles about honesty and fairness as always being the best policy which is why you feel you were right, but you misunderstand what casinos are and why people go there. Casino games, by their very nature are rigged in favor of the house. A person might win a game, but with enough people, enough games and enough time, the house always comes out on top. Their business model is fundamentally predatory and the everyday customer is usually at a disadvantage. Even their design (no windows, confusing layouts, stimulating lights, higher oxygen levels) and perks (free drinks and other comps) are chosen to keep people around, spending, and addicted for as long as possible. The reason people go to casinos and play isn't to be \"the fair winner\", it's to be the lucky few of the night that took home more than they spent. Your bf knows he isn't an expert at cards and understands he's more likely to lose, he just wants the fun of winning even when the odds are stacked against him.\n\nBy telling on your bf, you end up taking away that experience. Even worse, you show him that you'd rather help a rigged business making millions make a profit it would have never noticed go missing. The only virtue in this would have been helping your dealer avoid losing their job for their mistakes as a newbie. However when you went to their boss the second time, you took that opportunity away. It's likely they got reprimanded and their footage got reviewed for more mistakes which may be out there. All in all, that dealer is likely on probation or fired and your bf likely realizes your commitment to honesty takes priority over your loyalty to him, even in unfair situations.
