I worked in surveillance for years (you know, the ones actually watching these cameras). We called in any errors and they did collect the money, be it a one-off $5 or $500 bet. If the customer refused to pay back, they would be removed from the tables for c amount of time, potentially banned if it's been an ongoing issue. Not to say we could catch every error on everything, so there's a chance people get paid out for things they shouldn't have, but our team was pretty solid.", "Not 'a big deal' definitely, but looked at yeah. For every single \"one-off instance\" I was aware of. Like when I was sup, and someone messed up the insurance on blackjack, so pocket change, it was called down even if it was just as I was in the process of correcting it.\n\nJust in my experience though, I just know the few places I worked in, over two countries. So not totally a fantasy.\n\nIf you worked in places that were less particular, I'd believe it absolutely. My workplaces however, were very exacting.", "you\u2019re living in a complete fantasy if you\u2019re taking this comment section this serious", "Lol. See ya later 80% off their regular clientele\u2026", "Whether or not the business is protected from things like that isn\u2019t the issue. Sure they screwed up and gave you money, does that make you morally absolved to pocket it.\n\nIf you went to a mom and pop store and they miscounted your change and gave you back an extra 20 dollars by mistake, do you still feel morally correct sliding that into your pocket? You\u2019d probably say something.\n\nJust because a company can afford the doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not wrong if you knowingly profit if someone else\u2019s mistake.", "That's not what was happening. She overstepped twice by interjecting herself into other people's business. She escalated the situation by involving the pit boss. SHE DID SOMETHING wrong. She behaved contrary to casino etiquette. \"Keep your mouth shut\" is harsh but it isn't abusive language. He didn't yell \"shit your mouth you effing B.\" When an attorney tells her client \"when the police ask you questions, keep your mouth shut\" that isn't insulting or abusive. It is instructional. When you're observing games you are not to interfere. Interfering can get you in really ugly situations with the people gambling and it can easily get you kicked out of the casino.\n\nThe majority of the people on this thread remind me of my autistic neighbor. They prioritize the rules of the game while having no understanding of the social norms at play.", "OP was trying to piss in her boyfriend's cheerios. Her behavior was contrary to casino etiquette. She caused a scene and was interfering in a game in which she wasn't participating. What she was doing will always piss off the gamblers. She was the problem.", "Sorry, but accepting winnings from a casino because of their staff\u2019s own mistake is absolutely not, and never will be, the same as keeping money someone dropped on the ground. Those two things do not equate at all.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Found the one person who has literally never said anything in their life that wasn\u2019t absolutely polite and perfect in every situation they\u2019ve ever been in.", "Andy Garcia", "lol why are you hunting me down to reply to you weirdo?", "A casino is not a mom and pop store.
