Is that something that you are ok with?", "NTA\n\nCasinos have cameras everywhere. They soon would have figured out the dealer paid your bf when they shouldn't have. Probably the dealer would have been fired and the both of you might have been banned.", "INFO: What type of \"new game\", and what type of casino was this?", "I wouldn\u2019t have noted it.\n\nCasinos have overpaid me too. If they want to give me money, I\u2019m not stopping them.", "YTA", "Lol soft YTA. Why would you not want your bf to have extra money? It was the casinos mistake to correct \u2014 not yours. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re stealing from St. Jude\u2019s. You ratted him and the dealer out for no reason other than to be all sanctimonious and high-horsey. I also don\u2019t think you avoided any scene-making by calling the pit boss over. You likely just redirected your bf\u2019s anger at you instead of the casino. Side note: are you okay with being with someone who is so prone to outbursts while drunk? Food for thought.", "YTA.  Dealer made a mistake that would benefit you and BF.  Anyone who thinks security would have noticed is absolutely delusional.  They watch everything live, but they aren't watching each hand at every table.  They are just watching for behavior out of the normal and will watch back if there is a complaint.  Sounds like you just wanted to prove you were right that BF should quit.\n\nI am a former poker dealer at a major east coast casino for additional info.", "NTA, you stated facts that the house would find out anyway. *You wanted to prevent his potential drunken scene* arguing with the house, but *now you're the one he's mad at* instead of the house. Your boyfriend was mad because *he wanted to sneak off with his earnings from their mistake*. You called it out which causes him a money loss, but highlights the fact that he didn't call it out himself. *He's telling you to keep your mouth shut in the future?*  Think about all that for a while and ask yourself if you don't deserve better company.", "NTA- You don't mess around like that in a casino. It is more than one person's job in a casino to make sure the house down't lose money it's not supposed to. There are cameras everywhere. You could have been banned and the dealer could have those their job.", "YTA. House already has an advantage in all games, and you have to go and protect a billionaire's money when their employees make a mistake?  Why is it \"the right thing to do\" to protect corporate profits when they have no problem ripping you off at every opportunity they get? You are the worst kind of person.", "YTA - there are times it's best to keep from talking. Your boyfriend was losing money. He was going to continue to lose money. The casino is happy to throw him a bone every once in a while, just to keep him in the seat losing money to the casino. The odds are always in favor of the casino. \n\nAnd pointing out the dealer's error only makes them look bad to the boss, could cost them their job. You are doing more harm than good by pointing out the error.\n\nRule of thumb from someone who has been to a lot of casinos and that the vast majority of people follow. If they make an error in your favor, you keep your mouth shut. If they make an error against you, you speak up politely immediately. There's a reason they put the cards back in order, it's so the hand can be examined.\n\nNow, if the dealer keeps making the same error, like 5 or 6 times and you just can't take it AND YOU ARE THE ONE PLAYING, you might say something non-commital like \"are you sure? I thought I lost.\" But if it's not your money and you are not the one playing, you shouldn't be injecting yourself into the game - you aren't part of the game.", "ESH.\n\nRule #1: If you see a dealer make a mistake that favors the players, you didn't see anything.\n\nHonestly just awful behaviour on your part. \n\nThe casino doesn't love you. The casino wasn't paying you and you didn't get an award or even a \"thank you for your honesty\" like you might if the local barber gave you too much change. \n\nThe casino won't run you down to give you money if they make an error.\n\nAnd if you make an error, they won't let you have a do-over. They'll say \"Oops! Our money now!\"\n\nAnd every single game deliberately is unfair, favoring the house. (often dramatically)\n\nIt sounds to me like you were:\n\n1. Mad that he was hammered\n2. Mad that he was burning $ by throwing good money after bad.\n3. Saw the opportunity to shit on his good time", "Fair enough if it was  charity shop giving you the wrong change or something, but calling the pit boss over to make sure the dealer didn't give your BF some undeserved winnings from a scummy place like a casino is a bit over the top in my opinion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou sound like the kid in class that would remind the teacher there was homework.", "YTA. Casinos are very good at collecting people's money. If they occasionally screw up, that's on them and is someone else's gain.  Would have been your boyfriend's gain had you kept your mouth shut but couldn't because you had a pointless point to prove. Next time he wants to go to the casino, you should go somewhere else.", "You may not be an asshole but you sound like you'd be no fun and that you don't have your boyfriend's back. \n\nI get doing the right thing when it's a person or small business... It was a CASINO. They wouldn't have done a thing if the dealer made a mistake unless it was thousands of dollars.\n And if she kept on making mistakes she shouldn't be handling money.", "YTA the poor casino might miss out on someone\u2019s gambling losses.  Boo boo.\n\nYou showed him where your loyalty was.", "Wow, person tried to be honest and her boyfriend said to shut up?\n\nRed flag on boyfriend being a decent person.\n\nYou don't take advantage of another persons mistake.\nJust because its in a casino doesn't make it right.\n\nSo many in here need to reevaluate their sense of honesty.\n\nNTA, and honestly, you need to evaluate your choice in boyfriend.", "ESH - It\u2019s not your business but also your bf shouldn\u2019t try to be shady in a casino. Those people don\u2019t mess around.", "YTA. It's the casino's mistake, not yours.", "NTA, it was clear that between the alcohol and the inexperienced dealer this game should have never happened or the dealer should have gotten more training and the bar people should have cut him off before he got to a state to become aggressive and cause a scene", "YTA - Is it your place to tell someone how to do their job? It sounds more like you didn\u2019t want to appear to be wrong.", "ESH. Why would you be such a narc? The casino is so grateful you're looking after their bottom line. Great job, wannabe cop.", "YTA", "Nta and run from him.", "You\u2019re the asshole mega.", "YTA. You screwed over your boyfriend and embarrassed him and the dealer and probably cost her her job. All to save a casino's money,  which is always won by being dishonest. Is this a real post?", "NTA as you stated they would have found out and even if they didn't honesty is the best policy I would have done the same thing", "NTA.\n\nI broke up with an otherwise nice man because he was willing to take advantage of a service someone forgot to shut off. The company pursued him for payment, and because he had called me LD on the service, I was pursued for information. It was a nightmare. \n\nThe lesson? Don't take/use what isn't yours. It comes back to bite you on the butt.\n\nAnd you certainly don't mess with a casino. Those dudes are serious about their money.\n\nGood call, OP. Don't cave to the user/cheater.", "NTA. Surveillance would have caught the transaction. It would have ended up involving security and been a huge ordeal.", "NTA but keep quiet next time.
