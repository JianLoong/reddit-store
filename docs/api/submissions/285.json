{"id": 285, "submission_id": "yiqnwe", "title": "AITA for not wanting my mom to come visit for my birthday?", "selftext": "My mom texted me a couple days ago asking if I wanted her to come visit me for my birthday, and I said I had to think about it and that I would let her know. After thinking about it I decided I just have too much going on right now between work and personal stuff. Also, I am still trying to be cautious about covid due to health issues, and my mom (+ the rest of the family she lives with) aren't as careful anymore about wearing masks, eating indoors, etc. so I'd be stressed about that too.\n\nShe called me today to talk more about it and we got into a whole argument where she was saying things like I should want her to visit and that it's absurd that I don't. But it's not that I don't actually want to spend that quality time with her; I love her and love doing things with her. But right now things are just so stressful and having her come would just add more stress on top of that. For my mental and physical health, I honestly just can't. It's my own birthday anyway, shouldn't it matter what *I* want?\n\nOne other thing I wanted to mention is that I'm currently staying at a relative's house who passed away a few months ago, and I'm here working on going through everything and getting the house ready to sell. So technically it isn't my own place, my parents inherited it. I don't know if this changes anything or if it makes me have no right to say whether she can or can't come since the place isn't actually mine - this is also one of her arguments and she said she doesn't care what I say, she's going to come up anyway because there is other stuff she wants to work on at the house. I told her she can come the next weekend instead but she just kept arguing with me about how selfish and ridiculous it is that her own daughter doesn't want to spend time with her, and especially on a day like my birthday. But honestly it's nothing personal at all and she's completelty taking it the wrong way. In the end I still think what I want should matter because it's *my* day and I have the right to spend it how I want it.

I have enough health issues and respiratory problems, the thought of adding more isn\u2019t appealing. It\u2019s frustrating when you don\u2019t ask anyone for anything except \u201cplease let me keep my home/living area as my safe/comfort zone\u201d and they try to steamroll over that one, easy to keep boundary."]}
