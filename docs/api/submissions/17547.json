Family counseling is a #1 priority right now. Otherwise, when you do decide to show your partner to them, they may never accept him.", "NTA. Five years is more than sufficient time after your spouse dies before dating. The fact that your so has issues with this is his problem to deal with, not yours.

But it's also fine if you do find someone! My dad passed away a few years ago and my parents were married for over 40 years. My mom has started to joke about dating again and you know what I did? I had a talk with my almost 70 years old mother to make sure she knew about STI's and safe dating habits. I'm excited for her to get out there, and my siblings are fine with it too. We feel that my mom is completely entitled to be happy and I hope she is, if she has a new partner or not.\n\nI'd also rather be open about it so my mom is willing to talk to me about who she might be dating.

They met when she had two older teenagers. She also was hesitant to merge families. The man had 3 young adult children. I came in to the picture to date my now husband when we were quite young, about 18. The wonderful man was being introduced, but he and his family kept at arm length from her kids and family. My MIL always thought to herself she\u2019d get her kids through high school and then fully integrate this man into her life. And she did integrate him into her life, eventually. The thing is though, that sets up patterns that continue. She had her family, he had his. She had holidays with her kids, he would come and join. She would join him when he hosted family gatherings with his side. Maybe that sounds ideal to many people. The downside is that they wanted to live together, but they\u2019d set up such separate family lives and expectations that it took them almost two decades to figure out how to do that without upsetting the apple cart of their lives, keeping their kids separate. They kept hosting two different sets of everything, one for her side, one for his side. Didn\u2019t even have a joint housewarming or bbq for their loved ones to meet. But at the same time they were also completely integrated into each others family. The wonderful man became grandpa to my kids. My MIL developed wonderful friendships with his kids, and his grandkids- some were young enough when she joined him that they looked at her as a grandma like figure. Eventually, the wonderful man got cancer, and he passed away. Both sides of their families finally met, and his adult kids and his grandchildren are absolutely wonderful people. We were happy to put faces to names, welcomed a chance to hug them in their grief, we appreciated their support and inclusion of my MIL, and they without prompting recognized the grandparent/grandchild relationship he had formed through her family. We have seen them over the years since he passed. People have remarked that we get on so well, it\u2019s a shame he was never able to see it. It\u2019s sad that we only met first while funeral prepping. \n\nSo, I understand not wanting to force relationships, and not wanting to make people merge when they don\u2019t need to. Maybe keep that up a few years. But 25? Too long. People should also be aware that by restricting relationships in order to let everyone have their space, they risk preventing good relationships and good memories that could have happened. If you love people, and those people are generally normal and sane, it\u2019s ok to let the different people or families you love know each other.

To find out that everyone in the family knew for 6 months and was specifically keeping the secret from her?\n\nThat is just human nature.  No one likes to feel excluded; especially from your family.\n\nOP didn't do anything wrong.  She is NTA.  It was an overreaction by her son but it is a natural reaction too.", "Two adults don\u2019t owe each other explanations about who they\u2019re dating. He\u2019s 25 with a wife, it\u2019s none of his concern.", "If you care about your son and want him to be part of your life, I would say you should invite him over for a serious conversation about how you feel. Ask him how he feels about you dating and why he feels that way, maybe he's also thinking about what his own wife might do in that situation and it scares him. If you had approached your son and talked to him about how you felt in regards to wanting to go out and date people again it might not have been as big a blow up. He might have been upset about it at the time, but it would be much easier to get over than finding out that you've been dating someone for 6 months. At this point it's too late to have that initial talk but if you want to, you can still have this discussion and just get everything out in the open.", "He definitely wasn't the last thing in my vagina since a month ago.", " You haven't done anything wrong, you are allowed to move on and be happy.", "why is this true?", "Are you dense or something? Why wouldn't the daughters know, especially the 14 year old who lives at home still? Is it not obvious to you that maybe part of the reason the son wasn't informed yet was because his mom knew his reaction would be the unreasonable one he had? You can stop spam replying to the comments already yeesh", "That saw her by coincidence, it was never like \"Surprise!\" I've been on the other end of the spectrum (my mom couldn't wait to introduce her new boyfriend to us) and I wish she would have waited a little longer.\n\nI think it's too situational to make a judgement on that part.", "Yeah, because she knew exactly how he would react. Like an asshole. Her son is an adult and she's an adult. She doesn't need to tell him a damned thing until she fucking feels like it.", "To me, 6 months is still fresh and new. We are still getting to know each other.", "Kids can't imagine their parents as sexual beings so that would be a great line to bring your son down to earth\n\nAnything to freak them out when they deserve it \ud83d\ude02", "I\u2019m absolutely dying at this thread, this right here is why I\u2019m on Reddit. Also NTA", "There\u2019s a difference between introducing and telling him that she has a partner or even that she\u2019s starting to date", ">She doesn't need to tell him a damned thing until she fucking feels like it.\n\nAnd she can remember that when she misses the birth of her first grandchild", "I don't mean tell him you're going to marry this person, I mean tell your son how you feel about getting back into the dating game in general. You already kept it secret that you're considering dating again so that ship has sailed, but at least have a genuine conversation about how you feel about being alone. That no matter what happens you will still love his father, but you are a human and you desire companionship.", "I mean, I see why you didn't tell him; if it's going to end in tears anyway, why bother. I wish you good luck sorting it out anyway", "You don't have to down vote me simply because I have a different opinion. This is a discussion sub, if you can't accept someone having a difference of opinion, perhaps this isn't the sub for you.\n\nI don't mean this in a mean way. We can agree to disagree, that's completely fine.", "So you agree the her son is a huge asshole. Good.", "Why...this is a grown ass 25 year old ? She doesn't need to vet anything by him about her personal life. That's toxic af", "It\u2019s not his business. Being related to someone does NOT mean you\u2019re entitled to know a damn thing about their private life especially their love life", "Lol, you\u2019re the one getting upset because you\u2019re getting downvoted - and it\u2019s not me, so", "> She doesn't need to vet anything by him about her personal life. \n\nShe doesn't, but as I said:\n\n> **If you care about your son and want him to be part of your life...**\n\nShe doesn't need to tell him every intimate detail of her personal life, but he clearly feels a way about the loss of his father, she should have an open conversation about that. I lost my mother at the same age, my father came to me some years later and told me he wanted to start dating again, I was all for it and would have been thrilled if he told me he had been dating someone for 6 months.\n\nClearly her son isn't for it, and while I don't agree with her sons point of view (it's very immature), she can at the very least find out WHY he's so bothered by this. Maybe he has some unresolved issues due to the loss of his father, everyone processes grief in different ways, it's not unheard of for an adult child to be bothered by their widowed parent dating again."]}
