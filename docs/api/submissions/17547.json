Processing grief does not mean it goes away, it means you have learned to live with it and have worked thru it to come to peace in your new reality.\n\nYou are absolutely not the asshole.\n\nHonestly I'd be pissed af to come home to people waiting for me in my own house.   Who the hell do you think you are? Talk about massive boundary stomping.  You don't have to run your life plans by anyone, and for all they knew you could have been out alllll day.

They don\u2019t have to like it  or him but they must respect you are an adult and it\u2019s your life. As a parent to teens you are wise enough to know when or if a partner integration may happen.

Dating as a parent is tricky. the best option is only introduce the kids when you're ready and know the person is worth introducing. Also it's been 5 years... That's a beyond reasonable timeline. \n\nIt's really weird your DIL especially is acting like this. I can understand your son\u2019s hurt but it's something for him to address privately and shouldn\u2019t prevent you from dating. Nor should they do this around the younger kids, if they were home that makes it so much worse. \n\nBringing his Grandma into it was super weird as well.

I can't stand parents who bring a whole slew of new partners around their kids.\n\nNot only this but it would be really difficult to navigate a relationship after being widowed so that makes it even more understandable that you would keep it private.\n\nThat said, I think six months is a good time to talk to the kids anyways. It really, really sucks they found out how they did. And to be honest I probably would have mentioned it to the oldest child before now.\n\nThat said, I don't judge how you're navigating this and I think your eldest (whilst entitled to his feelings) is being unfair with those comments.\n\nYou're not betraying anyone and you're allowed to move on.\n\nI hope this all resolves itself.", "NTA, you don't bring home a man and say: hey, its your new father! \n\nMy mom passed away 15 year ago.

Your other child say its fine, so don't worry :)", "NTA moving forward and deciding when to date again is very much up to you, and since your son is an adult it's none of his business.

Your son is an adult. He doesn\u2019t get a front row seat in your life anymore-he has his own to live. You have the right to tell your family about this when you\u2019re ready to tell them.

I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. It is a shock to your son and daughter in law but hopefully they will come around.

Only thing I\u2019d do differently is reassure the kids that if I were ever to become seriously attached to another man they\u2019d be the first to know - but otherwise my male friends weren\u2019t going to be paraded past them for approval.\n\nETA - NTA.", "Most men that I know who lost their wives remarried within a year or two.

I think it shows how wrong their attitude is. If you interfered with their private life at the same level, how would that go down?\n\nYou suffered the loss of your husband, these people have no right to judge your behavior.", "Much sooner. A simple \"I'm seeing someone\" would be enough.", "You said in another comment that your son didn't know. And then he finds out you've kept this relationship secret only from him for 6 months. I agree that you're NTA for dating and moving on, but a son losing his father can be a big deal for him even if he doesn't outright show it. You shouldn't be surprised that he's upset.", "You never told them you were dating.   If you'd talked to them earlier, that would have diminished the drama, got them used to the idea slowly and gently.

Don\u2019t listen to that comment (I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll have plenty of downvotes within a few hours)\n\nIt is absolutely none of anyone\u2019s business who you date.\n\nNTA", "Right! It's been 6 months.", "> It isn't if she doesn't plan on bringing the dude around her 14 year old. \n\nYes!

Myself, I introduced my kids to my partner when I knew it was a long-term relationship and that we\u2019d want to move in together. We both had kids with over a decade till 18 (still do), and I refuse to make my kids live with someone they don't actively want to live with. If they were near adulthood and moving into their home wasn't a factor? The timeline would have been VERY different.", "But why? They've only been dating 6 months that's nothing. Why introduce someone to your kids or tell them your dating if it's not a serious thing yet? I would argue it's harmful to mention or introduce someone your dating to your kids if you don't know if its serious or not and haven't been together very long", "Yes, my main concern is my daughter who still lives with me and still depends on me. As for my son, he is independent and my dating someone doesn't affect him UNLESS I brought him around which I never have and don't plan on doing.", "I just said it isn't. She's not planning on him meeting the 14 year old, so it's really none of her kid's business.", "It would've ended the same way.", "No, I can see why :-(", "Yes but surely that will happen sooner or later?", ":-(", "No, hun. You were trying to help me out with this situation!.", "No, not \"surely\" as she could decide in a few days not to see him anymore. Which is probably why they've never met. She also mentioned in a comment that the kids at home *do* know that she's dating."]}
