{"id": 8597, "submission_id": "10o8rjj", "title": "AITA for throwing my friend out of my birthday party because she asked for a smaller piece of the cake?", "selftext": "I have been friends with this girl, Tara, forever. We've both always been on the heavy side. Throughout our school days, we both used to get bullied for it. I think this experience just pushed us closer together and we became inseparable. We are both in our early 20s now, and Tara has lost a lot of weight. She used to be 190 pounds and now she's down to 145. I've noticed that her behaviour has changed a lot since her weight loss. She wears more revealing clothing now, eats a lot less and is more social than she used to be. Which means that she spends less time with me, when we used to hang out a lot before. This hurt me, but I can see that she's happy, so I never brought it up. \n\nA few days ago, it was my birthday. A situation took place that turned a little too messy than it needed to be. One of our friend's made a brownie cake for my birthday, and when the time came to cut out pieces for everyone, my sister cut huge slices for everyone. When she handed Tara one of these slices, she said that she only wants to taste a little bit of it, and cut the piece into two, eating only half of it. When she said this, she was standing right next to me, and I was eating my \"big slice\". I told Tara that she was being ridiculous. One whole slice of cake isn't going to do her any harm, but she told me that it never stops at one slice for her, so she'd rather eat only a little, enough to taste it so that she remembers she has control over her eating habits. This ticked me off. She was clearly trying to take a jab at me and my eating. I told her she was being bitchy and trying to body shame me. She denied this, and wouldn't accept responsibility for her actions so I told her to leave. \n\nOut mutual friends have all told me I'm the asshole for doing what I did, and Tara isn't speaking to me currently.

SHE is recovering from an eating disorder, she's clearly done work on changing her relationship with food, and it's having a substantially positive impact on her life.\n\nYou, in your jealousy, saw that she was happy and making active choices and started behaving like the worst kind of friend, like pushing alcohol on a recovering alcoholic because \"you used to be more fun\".\n\nClearly you don't like where you are.

Or was she just explaining herself after not being allowed to just get on with it?\n\nIt looks to me like she is just managing her habits by being consistent, so that she doesn't backslide. It sounds like it's all about her -- in a good way. She knows to be mindful of her weaknesses and temptations and has a healthy way of managing them. It sounds like she's aware that she's not at a point where she can throw caution into the wind once in a while -- and so she doesn't.\n\nYou sound like you are the sensitive one here making everything about you -- in a bad way. Her simply living as she does now in order to keep accomplishing her goals is not a slight against you, unless she is doing something *additional* to that, such as making sly comments or giving you looks indicating she thinks she's better than you.

We've both always been on the heavy side. Throughout our school days, we both used to get bullies for it. I think this experience just pushed us closer together and we became inseparable. We are both in our early 20s now, and Tara has lost a lot of weight. She used to be 190 pounds and now she's down to 145. I've noticed that her behaviour has changed a lot since her weight loss. She wears more revealing clothing now, eats a lot less and is more social than she used to be. Which means that she spends less time with me, when we used to hang out a lot before. This hurt me, but I can see that she's happy, so I never brought it up. \n\nA few days ago, it was my birthday. A situation took place that turned a little too messy than it needed to be. One of our friend's made a brownie cake for my birthday, and when the time came to cut out pieces for everyone, my sister cut huge slices for everyone. When she handed Tara one of these slices, she said that she only wants to taste a little bit of it, and cut the piece into two, eating only half of it. When she said this, she was standing right next to me, and I was eating my \"big slice\". I told Tara that she was being ridiculous. One whole slice of cake isn't going to do her any harm, but she told me that it never stops at one slice for her, so she'd rather eat only a little, enough to taste it so that she remembers she has control over her eating habits. This ticked me off. She was clearly trying to take a jab at me and my eating. I told her she was being bitchy and trying to body shame you. She denied this, and wouldn't accept responsibility for her actions so I told her to leave. \n\nOut mutual friends have all told me I'm the asshole for doing what I did, and Tara isn't speaking to me currently. Aita?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "[removed]", "YTA so much.

Also, this seems to be more about your owm insecurities than her brownie eating.", "YTA. She\u2019s learned to eat in moderation, lost a lot of weight, and has gained self confidence.

This was ObViOuSlY a jab at me\u201d like no, get over yourself", "YTA - why you thought it was appropriate to pressure someone to eat more than they wanted to is wild.

I guarantee it isn't just her developing a healthier relationship with food that makes her spend less time with you.  You lashed out at her for making a personal choice about a slice of cake.

It\u2019s almost impossible to lose weight without doing real and lasting damage to your health. \n\nSome people, however, are able to lose weight quite easily (from a physical perspective) but emotionally they struggle. So yes that one slice of cake isn\u2019t going to hurt you, you understand that it\u2019s just the one, you aren\u2019t going to drive to the store after a party and go on a binge. \n\nBut babe, it could be that way for her. By putting the spotlight on her eating habits (not yours, no matter where she was sitting) and demanding she do something you wanted her to do with her own body, and then attack her vulnerable admission that she has difficulty controlling her eating-was not ok. \n\nEmotionally eating is humiliating, because like most mental health struggles it \u201cshould\u201d be something we can control, right? Sometimes I get mad when people assume I\u2019m heavy because whenever I get sad I probably binge ice cream or something. \n\nI have a lot of hang ups where I won\u2019t allow myself to almost eat at all when I\u2019m sad, because I find that label so hurtful.\n\nI\u2019m sure if you are not an emotional eater you become furious when people try to pretend you are-think if that were true, and you actually were and you were being blasted at a party by your best friend?\n\nCall and apologize, tell everyone in your group you were out of line. You\u2019re young and living as a bigger person is difficult, you\u2019re going to have to learn to love yourself the way you are and maybe get therapy for the abuse you have suffered up to this point.

Maybe she has an eating disorder and can't control herself? \n\nI'm a larger dude who tries to monitor my intake because I'd like to be at a healthier weight for my joints etc. It is nothing to do with you. Stop making it about yourself. You're acting out because you feel like you're losing your friend, but the reality is you're pushing her away.", "Wow, YTA.  \"She was clearly trying to take a jab at me and my eating. \"  No, she's trying to control her portion size, which she should be allowed to do, ESPECIALLY since she's lost a lot of weight and wants to stay that way.  Everything people say or do isn't all about you.", "She said it never stops at one slice FOR HER. so it doesn't even seemed aimed at you, you were just standing next to her.\n\nYou're projecting your issues with your food and your weight on things other people say about themselves, nd insisting on being hurt and offended.\n\nYTA here, and you owe her a sincere apology.", "Yeah OP is clearly projecting their own insecurities. YTA op, your friend is entitled to consume whatever amount of food they want without it having anything to do with you.", "OP is just insecure about herself(clearly) so everything concerning weight or food habits feels like jab at her even if that is not true.", "You\u2019re jealous and won\u2019t admit. If you wanna lose weight ask her for tips instead of pulling her down", "Exactly big ASSHOLE", "This reason YTA.", "After this I don't need to say more...\n\nYTA", "She even said that her and her friend were bullied for being overweight and now she is bullying her friend for losing weight.", "YTA \n\nAs an addition to point 1, OP is trying it sabotage her friend\u2019s weight loss. She\u2019s acting like a junkie trying to get her clean friend hooked again. \n\nAs a fat, I will say that the yo-yo weight thing is hard, and it takes real effort to make improvements in weight and lifestyle. And good for friend for doing it. As a kid, my mom constantly called me fat while feeding me pop tarts for breakfast. As a kid I made peace with with the fact that I was and always would be a fat person, and to love myself in spite of it. I\u2019ve gotten in great shape a few times, but don\u2019t realize until I reach fat again and look back saying \u201cdamn I was pretty hot then\u201d.  I\u2019ve never figured out how to see myself as something else, \u2018in shape\u2019 feels an abnormality, like one of the unstable elements at the bottom of the periodic table, provable but fleeting. \n\nWhatever self improvement journey she is on, I\u2019m happy for her and wish her the best. It\u2019s brave to imagine oneself as a new reality, and to change something you\u2019ve probably done a lot of work to forgive yourself for. I hope friend has learned from this and sees who OP really is.", "Exactly this, YTA", "OP just wishes her fat friend remained fat and stayed friends with only her.\n\nIf you have insecurities deal with it yourself or get help/support from your friends to work on it. Don't project them onto others, which is a really good way to push people away", ">The way I read this: \"My fat friend lost weight and isn't ONLY MY FRIEND now! She must think she's better than me and is taking jabs at me now!\"\n\nDon't forget \"I'm super jealous that she lost weight and I didn't.\"", "Not to mention:\n\n>but she told me that it never stops at one slice for her\n\nPoor Tara went out of her way to be clear that her not having more cake was *her problem* and hers alone, but that wasn\u2019t good enough for OP.", "Right? That was the thing that was most striking to me- the lack of insight into her own motivations, insecurities and fears. This is a real study in how people can drive themselves insane reacting to things without clarifying them/ communication. Fact is OP is envious of her friend and not a little bit jealous. I hope she gets the help that she needs to overcome her own internalized body shame. Because it\u2019s sad and it\u2019s going to cost her in ways she can\u2019t anticipate.\n\nYTA OP, you\u2019re letting your insecurities ruin your life, quit it", ">I told her she was being bitchy and trying to body shame me.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like OP is trying to body shame her friend for losing weight.", "All of this. OP, you\u2019re projecting and YTA. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being fat, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with losing weight and changing your habits. What\u2019s wrong is when you treat other people the way you\u2019re treating your friend.", "I get that it must be hard to see somebody that you bonded with over being overweight and the stigma (and bullying) that often comes with it, change so much. It might feel to you like your friend is \"leaving you behind\" and maybe you even think she\u00b4s kind of \"betraying\" you (because you might have told each other that it\u00b4s ok to be different and that everybody who treats you different because of your appearance is an asshole - which is absolutely correct, people like that are A\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*s). But you know OP, when you loose weight it might not necessarily have to do with wanting to be \"like them\" or something like that. Loosing weight will usually give you more energy, you can move more comfortably, you get a whole different feeling for your body. Skin and hair might get better too and a lot more changes might come as side effects that make you feel better about yourself. As a young person, that might be enough change for somebody to change a lot in their behaviour as you describe your friend now, as you gain confidence and might have a different relationship to your body and yourself. \n\nTara might just simply feel great about herself and enjoy life. You feel left behind, but rather than being angry at your friend, ask yourself: are you happy with yourself? If the answer is YES, then there is no reason why you can\u00b4 be happy for your friend also and not take everything personally or interpret everything as an insult /attack. If the answer is NO, you should still be happy for your friend and start to change about yourself what makes you unhappy. Also: apologize to your friend.   \n(YTA, because you are a shitty friend in trying to expecting her to change her eating habits so that you don\u00b4t feel bad about your own)", "Yes!!! And if having a \u201cfat friend\u201d is important to OP, why don\u2019t they just find a new one? Tara is under no obligation to gain her weight back.", "Even if she did refuse, people don\u2019t have to have cake if they don\u2019t want to. OP is ridiculous, how could you type this out and still think you aren\u2019t an AH.", "Misery loves company, as they say.", "wouldn't be surprised if the \"mutual friends\" left her on read moving forward", "OP is the shittiest and most immature 'friend' ever, honestly. Instead of being happy for her friend, she's projecting her insecurities and also feeling tons of envy that that girl managed to lose weight and change her life for the better in terms of health and socializing. Throwing her out of the party? I would NEVER speak to OP again in my entire life if I was that friend. Instead of being supportive and appreciative of the friend's discipline to lose weight and become healthier, OP would have definitely liked her to stay 'fat' and receive no attention, just so they'd both be eating the big slice of cake. FOH.", "Not even really half a piece of cake. OP said her sister cut huge slices for everyone. Half of a huge oversized piece is probably a normal piece or normal serving.", ">SHE is recovering from an eating disorder\n\nThis right here. Instead of attacking their friend for their hard work and recovery, they should be looking to them for help to join them in recovery. It's clear op is upset they don't have the same success as their friend, but asking them how they did it and for support is the right approach here, not shaming them for their success. \n\nDefinitely YTA", "Yes!!! YTA. I\u2019ve lost a lot of weight, and while I will pig out at *my* birthday, I eat modestly at others\u2019 birthdays. If you use any excuse to pig out, then you will regain the weight. So OP should understand that it\u2019s normal to eat a big piece at your own party, but not necessarily someone else\u2019s. If Tara was judging her, it would be different, but she wasn\u2019t.", "Tara wants to maintain her self control knowing that a bunch of sugar will make her crave more and possibly fall back on old habits.
