That way, hypothetically, everyone is happy. YTA.", "YTA for not thinking of a third option, which was having a smaller party. I get how it's mean to throw a party for, say, 30 kids and only exclude 3. But it's also very dismissive to force your kid to invite people she really doesn't want to be around. You could have planned something maybe a little cooler for just her and her closest friends, problem solved.", "YTA. You just taught your daughter that no doesn't mean no, it means maybe if I can convince you its a good idea.\n\nYTA like, wow, she is old enough to know who she doesn't want at a birthday *and who cares if one, two, or 6 kids get left out* that's life, you get left out, figure out how to deal with it.\n\nJust in case: YTA.

Your daughter is old enough to choose who she doesn\u2019t want at her party. You\u2019re old enough to not make that about you. You probably felt so magnanimous for not excluding anyone, but you wound up excluding your daughter from her own party planning.", "YTA, you most definitely can exclude kids from parties.\n\nOr how about you do something unconventional and actually ask your child who she wants to invite?\n\nMy guess is that the party was an excuse for you to be the centre of attention and you did that at the cost of your daughters happiness.", "YTA: \u201cthey don\u2019t bully her, they just kicked her out of their friend group\u201d.

This can lead to her having trouble enforcing boundaries in other spaces. \n\nYou ruined her birthday so as not to \u201cexclude\u201d when in reality she is the one being excluded. You as her parent should\u2019ve supported her, not forced her to spend her special day with her bullies (a group of girls dumping one friend is absolutely bullying). \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d organize a replacement celebration day with the friends of her choice.

You showed your daughter that it's more important for you to be a \"nice\" host than listen to her wishes on HER birthday. You completely dismissed her feelings and ruined her party. Should have only invited kids she wanted to (and I doubt she's such close friends with all other 27 kids in her class) and had a smaller party.", "YTA. Kicking her out of their friend group is bullying. You should have respected her wishes or at least investigated more as to why she was so adamant. I\u2019m a former elementary school teacher and those issues we see are small are still very big to them, and they echo into older ages and even adulthood. Not having her feelings and boundaries validated probably did some damage.", "YTA \nI'm amazed that you'd rather exclude your daughter from her own birthday to appease 3 other children that don't even want to be friends with her.", "YTA \n\nYour daughter wanted her birthday party to be a safe space where she wasn\u2019t going to be bullied by those 3 girls.

What kind of a parent are you", "YTA. \n\nYou should have asked her that beforehand and respected what she has to say. Kids can be cruel and don't always makeup.

I also think you may have mistaken a conflict for socially isolated kids.", "INFO: did you ask your daughter why she didn\u2019t want the girls there?", "YTA\n\nKicking someone out of a friend group may in fact be a form of bullying. It\u2019s a trick young girls, especially, use to exert dominance, often having nothing to do with anything the bullied child did wrong.", "YTA the fact that you didn\u2019t have her back TWICE is something she won\u2019t forget. You shouldn\u2019t have invited the *whole* class if that meant it would ruin the party for your daughter. You should have just invited the few friends", "YTA - it would be ok to invite someone she wasn\u2019t close or friends with, but inviting those people after a strong reaction from your daughter isn\u2019t good", "Op YTA. Your daughter needed your support and to be heard and respected and she was disappointed on all fronts. Please talk to your daughter and find out what is going on and then support who through it.\n\nYour priority is supposed to be your daughter's emotional well-being.   Let the other girls mother's worry about their kids a d focus on your girl...good luck.", "YTA. This is a betrayal of trust. And you seem awfully sure that \"kicking her out of the friend group\" doesn't constitute bullying - wanna rethink that now that your kid has been hurting for two days about it?", "YTA, even more so after your edit.\n\nYour daughter told you the reason she didn't want those girls at her party. If they made up before then, your daughter would tell you those 3 girls would be coming. Instead, you assumed they will \"make up\" by then.\n\nShe confided in you her boundaries, and you disrespected those boundaries.\n\nYour daughter did a good job of communicating her needs, and you need to listen more than assume you know everything / best. I hope you are able to fix this relationship or say goodbye to your daughter ever sharing anything important to you.\n\nPlus it's her birthday. You don't do that on someone's birthday.", "YTA.\n\nIt appears that the party was more about showing you as a nice hostess than for your child. A child who appears to have a problem at school.", "Obviously YTA\u2026 you ruined her party and clearly have no respect for boundaries she laid out.", "I will never understand whole class invites. It's not worth the risk of inviting people who they don't want to see. \n\nNo one is owed an invite, people who they don't like don't need to come.

Respect your child\u2019s boundaries.", "Wow YTA your daughter could very be bullied by these girls but you never even asked her what was wrong.", "YTA, your daughter stated her boundaries and you stepped right over them ON HER BIRTHDAY, and then tried to make a lesson out of it? Not okay at all.", "YTA. This day is about your daughter's happiness, not your moral superiority. You made a little girl cry and ruined her birthday.", "YTA. She didnt want them there, she cried when they showed up. You've taught your daughter that you will steamroll over her and disregard her feelings. All because you didnt want anyone left out.", "YTA\n \nYou ought to be ashamed. You undermined her twice.

You literally allowed your daughter's bullies into your home to bully her during her own fucking birthday party after she explicitly asked you not to.

And you just invite these bullies to your house where they can smugly walk around her house, invade her privacy, and her own mother supports her enemies over her... you better turn this around or she'll never speak to you once she's an adult.

My father was like you, we haven't talked in 4 years,\n\nYTA", "You invited your daughter's bullies (theyve thrown her out of the friend group and aren't talking to her.... which is shunning & bullying) to her party when she specifically asked you not to...\nYeah...\n\nYTA\n\nI expect she has lost all trust in you. Good luck ever regaining it back.", "YTA\n\nShe didn't want them there and you decided to go against your daughter's wishes and invite them anyway. Essentially ruining her birthday, well done you", "A few years ago there was a bully in my daughter\u2019s class. I didn\u2019t want to invite him to her birthday party, but because it would have been too suspicious to single him out, I decided to not invite everyone in the class and just invite the girls. She had a great time and I spent less money since it was only half the class.\n\nETA: I almost forgot to render the verdict: YTA. Always listen to your child when they tell you something. I know what it\u2019s like for friends to suddenly stop playing with me. It\u2019s very hurtful.", "\"They don't bully her they just kicked her out if their friend group\" how is that not bullying? And why would you invite kids who *excluded your child* to her BIRTHDAY? Jesus christ. YTA", "YTA\n\nShe didn't want them there. You ruined your child's birthday OP. Just cause she's 7 doesn't mean she does not know what she wants", "You can have a small party and invite a few kids. You cannot invite the whole class with the exception of a few kids.  \nMANY schools have very explicit rules about this, for a reason.  \n\n\nIf your kid doesn't want to invite the whole class, they should select 6 or so kids to do something with.  \n\n\nYou are right for not letter her exclude a few select kids, but she should have had the option for a smaller party if she really didn't want to be around them.", "It all depends on the reason she didn't want them there, if she was excluding them for the sake of excluding them, then she definitely needed to learn that that sort of behaviour is not ok. However if the girls have been bullying her and making her feel upset/unsafe in school then you brought her tormentors into her home, a place where she's meant to feel safe.
