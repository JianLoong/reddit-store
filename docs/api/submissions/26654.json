We have just finished our Thailand part of the trip and were packing to leave for Vietnam, our fight was in a couple of hours. While packing she realised she had lost her passport. For context she has been fairly careless this trip with her bank card being blocked because she didn\u2019t tell her bank she was leaving the country and losing her phone by leaving it around our hostel. \n\nWhen she found out she had lost her passport she immediately called her brother and avoided/ignored my questions because she was stressed. I asked her if we should look up how to get emergency passport and she said no she is too stressed and her brother will find out what to do. The whole time she was avoiding me by walking into different rooms giving one word reply. So I decided that I would be no help by staying in the hotel and our flight was in an hour so I would just go to Vietnam. I had already booked and paid for my whole trip in advance and I didn\u2019t want to lose the money. I also felt like I was getting in the way and was confused what was happening. At the time she was fine with my decision to leave, hugging me goodbye and telling me she will miss me. \n\n\n\nHowever when I landed, I got a text from our mutual friend that she is really mad at and is telling everyone I abandoned her in a different county. When I asked her about this she said that now that she has had some time to think about this, she thinks I\u2019m an asshole for leaving and if the situation was reversed she would\u2019ve stayed. She said I should\u2019ve offered to stay and she shouldn\u2019t have to ask. \n\nOur friends say they understand both sides but my family say I\u2019m in the right as I shouldn\u2019t waste my trip and money\n\nEdit - I\u2019m getting a lot comments saying I should\u2019ve never left a friend in a foreign country and should have shown more empathy to her. I comment this below but think maybe is this was her first \"emergency\" I would've should more empathy. It had become more of a pattern than anything. I was there and figured her how to get her phone and a new SIM card. I lent her a lot of money when her card got blocked (until her brother could send her money) . Payed for things in advance for her because she had to wait for her brother to transfer. Booked flights for her because she accidentally booked the wrong one which cost us money.\nAnd the key of my argument was that she wasn't communicating with ME She was freely talking to her brother and laughing (she says she does this when stressed) while we are good friends, her emergency can\u2019t always be an emergency for me\n\nEdit 2 - also for everyone worrying over my friend she is currently out clubbing rn so I think she will be fine in a foreign country alone\n\nFinal update- I don\u2019t know if this is the update everyone was hoping for but we both talked on the phone now that we have cooled down a bit. We both admitted we were in the wrong, she with being irresponsible with her belongings and me leaving her there alone. We have been friends for a long time but this is the first time we have travelled together so both understand there would be some issues but to not let this incident ruin our friendship. And we also have tickets to see Taylor swift next summer we are stuck together lol. Thank you for the advice it helped me let go of my pride and see things from her side too.", "created_utc": 1694437743, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16fuv6c/aita_for_leaving_my_friend_in_thailand_after_she/", "score": 2351, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You shouldn't have to cancel your whole trip and lose all of that money because of her mistake. And it sounds like she had the support of her family (they could send her money, etc. if needed).", "NTA she literally avoided you and every question. You had a solution, she ignored you and kept on panicking. You already paid for this trip it\u2019s not like the airline will care your friend lost her passport\n\n\nAlso. She would have given you the money? Then she would have the money to travel the 15hrs to an embassy. She\u2019s going to have to go there anyway to get an emergency passport", "Nta. She was irresponsible with her passport.  Why should your vacation be ruined and you lose the money you paid for the trip due to her irresponsibility?  She didn't want to take care of the problem herself.  She wanted he brother to take care of her.  She did nothing to keep the vacation going.  Nope she is the ahole.  You just continued with your vacation plans.  How would it have helped if you had canceled your vacation and just stayed with her. She is an adult. She made the mistake.  She is not your responsibility.", "NTA. She wanted her brother's help and if she didn't want your help there was no reason for you to not continue your vacation as planned. If she needed or wanted your help it would be different, but at the time she didn't either want or need you to help resolve her error. It's unfair to decide you were wrong later just because she later changed her mind.", "Tell everyone that she hugged you and demanded that you not waste your trip over her.", "This is sooo tough to judge. I've been on holiday with a friend like this who acted carelessly with their possessions because they're \"relaxing on holiday\" but then when they lost their phone it was on me to try and get it back because they were too stressed. It really ruins your holiday and stresses you out. There's no real financial compensation for losing that travel experience too.\n\nThat being said it's scary to lose your passport and be stuck in Asia so she probably really needed your support. HOWEVER, going on a 15 hr bus journey to the embassy with her? That's asking a LOT of you\n\nHow much would a replacement flight have cost if you went the next day, just until she had a plan in place? Could she have travelled to the next country with you with an emergency passport or would she need to go straight home?", "NTA. Why should you lose money because of her carelessness. Also, she was fine with you leaving at the time.", "YTA, I would not think about leaving a friend behind or doing the vacation we started together alone. With a good friend, I would have more fun staying with her and figuring things out, so we can laugh about it later, than travelling alone. \n\nBut if I go on vacation with friends, they are the real good ones, and no one would abandon any one of us. Perhaps it was not \u201ebest friend\u201c material in your case.", "Esh.\n\nShe is an idiot. The end on her part.\n\nBut I can't imagine what kind of friend you are to think ok byebye I am going. You don't ditch your friends.", "sorry, but there's no way in hell i would leave a friend (and a young female one at that) behind in another country.", "NTA- she\u2019s an adult and has to fix her own issues given the timing of your flight. She\u2019s blaming you for her mistake and after losing her phone and the bank card issue, it\u2019s her fault.\n\nWas she going to reimburse you for the flights and hotels? Probably not. Now you know you can travel with her and she\u2019s a mess.", "I am going against the majority here, but I would go ESH.   \n\n\nIt is absolutely on your friend to keep track of their possessions, and I would even argue that if you miss your flight because of her careless-les she should probably compensate you. Her loosing her Passport and not communicating with you about the follow up steps absolutely makes her an asshole.  \n\n\nOn the other hand, you and your friend were on vacation together in a foreign country that is (presumably) far away. This means you both don't really know the environments and should be able to depend on each other if something goes wrong or someone is in danger. So, as much as I think she was being an asshole for the way she behaved, I (personally) don't believe that makes it OK to leave her behind.(It would be a reason for me to make it the one and only trip I ever do with this person).", "I am saying ESH. Redditors really love to be and promote selfishness. Friendship sometimes requires sacrifice to build and maintain trust. You're right to be annoyed with her, and she is right to be annoyed with you. I can't imagine leaving my friend in a foreign country due to a mistake like that. Travelling as a woman by yourself is dangerous. You suck for prioritizing your vacation over her safety. She sucks for being careless and ruining your trip.\n\nI'd stop being friends with you over this.", "YTA - ditching your panicking friend in a passport emergency over the potential loss of a flight reschedule charge and potentially one night in a hotel or hostel is definitely AH behaviour.  Ditching a friend in ANY panic situation / emergency over money is something I can't get behind, even if that friend is unreliable.", "NTA.  She was careless on several different things and didn't want your help when you offered it.  Not sure why her tune changed, but probably to deflect from her own carelessness.", "Don't know if yta but you're definitely a shitty friend.", "I\u2019m not going to pass a judgement on you. I just went on a three week trip through Asia (Thailand included) with one of my close friends, and I can\u2019t imagine leaving her if she\u2019d lost her passport, but I also can\u2019t imagine her being nearly as careless as your friend was. \n\nI will say, this is a good lesson to be very careful about who you travel with internationally, especially for that long. I\u2019m sure you know this now, but when you\u2019re in these foreign countries that don\u2019t speak English and have a whole new system of currencyc transport, etc. for you to figure out, the only person you can rely on is the person you\u2019re traveling with. Effectively, you should be able to trust them with your life. And then on a less life threatening side, it absolutely sucks to travel with someone who doesn\u2019t communicate or is generally not fun to be around. \n\nIn the future, I\u2019d suggest trying smaller trips to see how they go before booking such a long trip. For instance, I did a day trip, a weekend trip and a week-long trip with my friend before we booked our big trip. So on our big trip, we knew how we traveled quite well and there were no surprises", "I\u2019m gonna say ESH. Yes, she shouldn\u2019t have reacted the way she did, but this is a high-pressure situation. Then you went and abandoned her in a foreign country. Just because she\u2019s fine right now doesn\u2019t mean something won\u2019t happen to her.", "Yta", "ESH. Her for being careless. You for ditching your friend in a foreign country without a passport lol. You\u2019re on vacation for a month, what does a day or two difference make. Hope the cost of that flight was worth your friendship.", "Can I just say I have been reading the OP's comments to everybody (mostly the YTAs) and she is so incredibly defensive. I don't know why she would be posting in something like this if she wasn't willing to be introspective and look at other people's perspectives. Maybe you're just feeling guilty for leaving your friend in a foreign country? Some friend.", "So you are upset because your friend lost her passport and when she was on a phone call trying to get it sorted out, you wouldn\u2019t wait a few minutes and got upset because you couldn\u2019t interrupt her conversation?\n\nYeah, big YTA energy here for that alone.", "I understand you don\u2019t wanna lose money, but morally I would never leave a friend behind in another country. It\u2019s just like you shouldn\u2019t leave your friend alone after you guys go out or have been drinking or anything.", " NTA, but I\u2019m gonna give you a piece of advice I know the exact type of chick that your friend is and you need to drop her ASAP. Don\u2019t travel with people like that, don\u2019t ever lend people like that money, stop covering for her inane and avoidable fuck ups. Travelling is a big deal full of responsibilities and tense situations that can have serious financial and safety consequences. Find a friend who treats you a little better and isn\u2019t a complete ducking idiot.", "NTA it was the straw that broke the camel's back.  She's not intelligent, and doesnt seem to be a functioning adult. She'd be a nightmare to carry on travelling with.", "Lol YTA.  Look, its annoying that your friend was careless and panicked, but you don't leave friends alone in a foreign country without a passport.  Part of being a friend is being there for them even when they make mistakes / dealing with difficult situations!  You mentioned this is a pattern with her- if thats the case, don't travel with her overseas again.", "Adults stay in  countries by themselves all the time. Strange country or not. She is adult.", "NTA - Ugh I would\u2019ve left her too. She sounds wayyyy too unprepared and disorganized for international travel as an adult.", "YTA - you don\u2019t leave a friend in a foreign country like that. I get that you felt pressure to make your flight, but you just up and left her to deal with this alone (I don\u2019t care that she has access to family via phone - you left her physically alone). One or two days to help her out was not going to ruin the rest of your trip. Things like this happen and they make for great stories later in life. Instead, you\u2019ll always be the AH who abandoned her friend in her time of need. Way to show her that she can\u2019t trust you.", "Sorry, but YTA in my eyes. What friend leaves under friend stranded in a foreign country? Sure she might be a bit weird with her belongings or whatever, but you are friends. Of course she wouldn\u2019t have wanted you to ruin your vacation but she most probably was in shock after losing her passport in a foreign country and not really able to communicate well. Leaving her behind is kinda shitty.", "NTA. Irresponsible people drive me nuts when I travel. Like you said, this was a pattern and not the first or second thing she did to make things harder. \n\nPlus, she already owes you money for her card being blocked and not having backup funds. It's understandable that you didn't want to stay around, miss your flight, and \"lend\" (doubtful that she's paying you back) her even more money to get this sorted. \n\nObviously never travel with her again.", "NTA, especially after that edit. She sounds scatter-brained and like she doesn\u2019t travel often (or if she does, she doesn\u2019t learn from her mistakes and lets others fix them for her). You don\u2019t need to lose more money and time because of her ineptitude. A passport is something you just HAVE to keep track of while traveling.", "Have her go to the nearest American embassy and ask them to help out", "YTA", "Nta I went to Vietnam with my brother, we got to the airport in the UK and I didn\u2019t have 6 months on my passport I said to him don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll catch you up! We were both gutted but I caught him up. I lost a lot of money but, I would have never expected him to stay, I wanted him to have a good time. I know I wasn\u2019t in a different country but I feel like that\u2019s the right person to do when they mess up the trip.", "NTA you learned a valuable lesson. You can't travel with everyone. I wouldn't have wasted my money either. She doesn't seem mature enough for international travel. She's careless and depends on other people to solve her problems. Be safe and don't travel with her again", "YTA, you abandoned your \u2018friend\u2019 in a foreign country because you felt inconvenienced (yes there\u2019s more padding around your story, but this is the bare bones of it). Your friend might have been annoying but you abandoned them, AH move", "ESH. Your friend is terrible for being so negligent- losing phone, passport, booking wrong tickets etc. But you can't leave a single girl alone in another country. You already said she is incompetent. Her going out clubbing just means she is going to end up in worse trouble.", "YTA. There\u2019s no way I would have left my friend alone in a foreign country to sort out such a stressful situation. I would never have been able to enjoy myself in Vietnam while knowing my friend was dealing with a serious issue alone. Yet you apparently did. And using the excuse that she wasn\u2019t communicating is frankly dumb. She was in obvious distress! Nobody communicates well while panicked. Real friends don\u2019t abandon friends when they\u2019re in distress. But hey, that\u2019s just me based on my definition of friendship. Yours is clearly different.\n\nEdit: OP decided to ad an edit with some valuable information AFTER I commented otherwise my opinion would have been different.", "YTA delaying your flight a day or two wouldn't have been much. Flights in SE Asia are usually around $100. You left your friend in a foreign country and now have to figure out how to connect with you in Vietnam.", "YTA. \nI get it that once you go on a trip with someone they could turn out to be annoying, like your friend here. \nBut that doesn\u2019t justify leaving your friend alone in a foreign country. \n\nShe should\u2019ve talked to you but it seemed like a rushed situation?? She might be anxious?\n\nif this post was about shouting at her for ruining the trip or something, I would have totally sided with you. But I cannot understand how people are saying NTA for leaving her alone in a foreign country????", "NTA - I'd dump her as a friend", "NTA. You literally offer to help with the one thing she should have been doing, finding out how to get a replacement passport and she not only rejected your help she proceeded to ignore you and childishly walk out of the room to avoid you. What was her brother going to do? Does he has magic powers to found or produce a new passport out of thin air?", "NTA\n\nIf she wanted or needed your help, she would have asked or involved you. \n\nSecond, it is very easy to get another flight so once she resolves her passport issue, she can simply join you. \n\nIt would be different if she had involved you and wanted you to stay and for example offered to cover your costs related to delaying/ missing your flights etc -- but she did not. It's not on your to assume significant costs bc she is continually negligent with her own property.", "She sounds like a mess. NTA. Though to assume that she\u2019ll be fine because she out clubbing alone in a foreign country\u2026 I sure hope that was sarcasm because I\u2019d say she\u2019s the opposite of fine, especially considering she doesn\u2019t seem to have much survival skills.", "ooo this is tough.  i can see both side.  i mean you went on a fairly exotic adventures together so she must be your close friend.  to leave her there alone while you continue to go enjoy a vacation is a bit heartless.  also, losing a passport and she doesn\u2019t have any access to her bank, A LOT of bad shits can happen to her.  basically if she disappear, nobody would know.\n\nyeah, now that i think about it, YTA.  seriously, if your friendship end bc of this, it would not surprise me.", "Where were you, that was 15hrs away from Bangkok? Thailand\u2019s not that big. I would never leave a friend alone in a foreign country like that. Why not delay your trip for a day or two for her to get an emergency passport.", "That decision is totally up to you and either one is perfectly acceptable. You didn\u2019t act a fool, she did. You both had a plane to catch, you caught it she didn\u2019t. That\u2019s not on you. NTA. Any reflection on her part should lead her to the opposite conclusion that it did.", "You're not an asshole for leaving her there. It wasn't the first rescue for her. It also sounds like she's doing fine now.\n\nI hope you have a great time on the rest of your vacation.", "NTA.", "NTA not your fault. Your not her keeper. Thailand U.S. beautiful and easy to navigate. You didn\u2019t leave her in Russia!!!", "NTA. She's the careless one and should've kept better track of her stuff.

You are not responsible for her incompetence in coping with her irresponsibility.", "NTA. She brought everything on herself.", "NTA the friendship is over. You\u2019re done with this being a pattern. But you have to be honest with yourself and know that it was a friendship ending act.", "NTA. Friends you can travel with are a rare find. She isn\u2019t one of them. You didn\u2019t spring it on her and she was fine with it. She can meet you in Vietnam when she figures it out. She is an adult not a child. She can handle things on her own and it would be unreasonable for you to loose your money because of another one of her mistakes. Tell her you weren\u2019t mad at her when she had a blocked card, booked the wrong flight, lost her phone, etc. In fact you helped her with everything. She expects everyone to fix her problems and cater to her.  Do you really want to be friends with someone like this?", "not ideal, I'd say NTA because realistically there was not much you could do.\n\nI would be interested if travel insurance would kick in though, then you would have been able to refund the flight lost because of carelessness.\n\nAlso, without shaming, but who loosed their passport?

I hope you have no plans to ever travel with this person again.", "NTA you tried to help, she didn\u2019t want it. You asked her what you should do and she accepted your decision. She is careless - enjoy Vietnam and stop worrying about what other people think!", "NTA\n\nShe was shutting you out. She relies on her brother and trusts him. OK, then that's what she needs to do. And yes, there's a big difference between a one-time emergency and a pattern of being a hot mess.\n\nDon't travel with her again.", "NTA. Your friend sounds exhausting. Plus she\u2019s definitely fine if she\u2019s clubbing. Can your friend do anything for herself or not?", "Sounds like she's a flake.  Don't plan anymore trips with her.

I have been to Thailand, and with normal precautions should be safe.  But frankly, you signed on to travel with a peer, not a child.  For all you knew, she would be getting on the next flight.  It sounds like she is not nearly mature enough for this kind of adventure and needs her mommy with her.  She can't even verbalize that she would like you to stay.  But yet expects you to react perfectly when she is creating catastrophic problems.\n\nMaybe  you're both selfish.

I couldnt imagine how terrified I would have been if my friend didnt care about me enough to leave me in a foreign country with no way of getting out.  You also wouldnt have lost any money, just would have been changing a flight and buying an extra night or two where you were.   I probably would have never spoken to that friend again if she pulled what you did.", "YTA \n\nIf anyone has backpacked in south east Asia, you can easily book another flight for $30-70 usd one way from Thailand to Vietnam. If you have the means to travel for a whole month, you could\u2019ve spared a day to be there for your friend while she sorted out her passport situation. \n\nIt just sounds like you lost patience with her and wanted to go off on your own. \n\n+1 to the other comments noting how highly defensive you are and only agree with anyone who validated your perspective.", "YTA. Yeah, it sucks that your friend is careless, but there's a big jump in levels of suckiness between not keeping track of your possessions and leaving your friend in a foreign country while she's completely stressed out. Especially since it seems she's an inexperienced traveler. Rebook the flight, and enjoy Thailand for an extra day or so while the passport issues get worked out, then head to Vietnam.", "NTA. She's making all of her careless mistakes into your problem. If she can't prioritize communicating with the person she's travelling with (and most affected by her poor decisions) then you have no obligation to coddle her anymore. Honestly, you should have set down more boundaries before it got to this point. She sounds exhausting.", "Does she ADD or something?", "NTA.  I did this in Thailand too.   a friend I was traveling with was very careless and had her passport stolen while skinny dipping with some guy she had just met.  She ended up going to Bangkok early to get her replacement passport and I went on to a full moon party and met up with her in Bangkok.  We haven't spoken since. No regrets.", "She sounds like an awful travel partner.", "Is your friend my ex? Lmao NTA", "NTA.\n\nYour parents are right - not fair for you to have lost out on something you paid for.\n\nPS - your friend sounds like a flake and you might do well in letting the friendship dissolve.", "Ytah. You probably knew all of this about her before you left. She is forgetful and unmindful. Ytah to yourself and for enabling her through your friendship. Other side of this is she was just anxious as hell in another country", "Good on you for taking the right decision. Next time, be very discerning about your travel partner. Much better to travel solo and make friends along the way than to travel with someone who is unreliable and requires constant minding. Thailand is pretty safe if she exercises common sense. Welcome to southeast Asia and enjoy Vietnam!", "I didn't see that anyone in the comments has considered the possibility friend didn't really lose her passport, but just didn't want to go to Vietnam.....\n\nNTA btw", "NTA - that\u2019s sounds like a her problem, not yours", "Has she ever solo traveled? \n\nI've solo traveled but I would never go on vacation with a friend who's never when solo before and then leave them. If you don't know how to navigate it's very easy to make mistakes. Did she know to call her bank in advance? Did she know that she would need to get a phone and a new sim card? I'm assuming she needed to get those because her phone was not unlocked and swapping sims wouldn't have worked. All things people who have traveled before or have done thorough research would know, but probably not a first time traveler.", "Nta", "NTA. if her answer is always to get help from big bro then let them sort this out themselves. the emergency passport would be the first thi g i would have done after turning the place upside down. she will be fine in thailand while waiting for travel docs as long as she has money to live off on.", "In this situation NTA. Your friend needed a sink or swim moment and to basically figure it out on their own", "You really find out a lot about a person when you travel with them.  This friend isn\u2019t worth traveling with.", "I know it\u2019s cold to have left but part of me also thinks this scenario has all the hallmarks of two people who are not destined to be, let\u2019s say, \u201cfriends for life.\u201d Still, that\u2019s the sort of knowledge that usually comes further down the road of life, no way I would\u2019ve done it at that age. But hey, OP is just built different and she was in Thailand, not a war zone. People need to chill a bit.", "Eh\u2026both. If your friend needed help, the best thing you could do was help her find resources by asking appropriate subreddits instead of posting on this one trying to defend yourself. \n\nYou\u2019re not the asshole for continuing your vacation, but this post is a waste of time if she actually needs help. \n\nBoth Thailand and Vietnam are extremely safe. If she\u2019s in Thailand and needs any advice, feel free to give her my account. I\u2019m a 40F expat here with many friends around the country. She can remain anonymous and if I\u2019m familiar with areas she is in then I\u2019m happy to assist with advice.", "Hm... this is a tough one. I don't think I'd Ieave a friend alone in a foreign country, but if the situation were reversed, I'd feel guilty they had to miss their trip because of me. I'll go with NAH. I see both sides.", "NTA - people like this bug me so much. Not my problem you can\u2019t look after yourself \ud83d\ude02", "As one of the old(er) men here (50\u2019s), I can tell you with great conviction that flakey poor communicators normally don\u2019t get much better with age.  They just become more bitter as the shine and beauty of their youth wears off. \n\nThey wonder why \u201ceveryone sucks\u201d and can\u2019t se that they were never a \u201ccatch\u201d but rather just hot on the outside.  \n\nAlso, spoiled people rarely change.  It\u2019s a sad truth.", "NTA. You know how much flights cost?? What exactly would you missing your flight do to help the situation? I\u2019d help her with all the research to get a new emergency passport (like you did) and make sure she is safe and can afford a new flight or changes, but I\u2019m getting on my flight home.", "NTA. She\u2019s a grown adult. You shouldn\u2019t miss out on your paid trip just because of her lack of responsibility.", "NTA. This is what you sign up for when you go on trips. Cant handle it, dont travel.", "NTA", "There are loads of young, solo, female travellers in Thailand, now there's one more.\n\nIf she doesn't feel op makes her safe and supported, what's the point in op staying with her?", "LOL. Thailand is probably the safest and easiest to navigate country for foreign tourists in the world. Friend is already checked into a hostel and is fine. Dumb, but fine. Literally any taxi driver in the city will speak enough English to get her to her embassy and hostel staff are going to be more than helpful in this situation. She can get an emergency travel document and fly back home and she's already figured out how to get money from her brother. OP is *also* in a foreign country all by themselves when the original plan was to have a travel buddy. That fell through when friend was irresponsible to the point of negligence. Depending on where they're from, OP's friend may only be able to get a travel doc that allows them to return to their home country which would mean rebooking an expensive last minute flight. Since they couldn't even be bothered to do that research themselves, I think it would have been crazy for OP to stick around. At a certain point friend needs to learn how to help herself. Could be a good learning experience for her.", "Nah, OP only *might* be an AH if the friend opened their mouth and explained why they really need OP to stay with them, offered to pay etc., and OP still left. That's what open communication is about. Mind-reading expectations can go fuck themselves. This means if I were the friend, people like that friend and you will insist to stay because \"you'd be the AH if you leave\" by some weird default, whereas I would be horrified because *I wouldn't want* my friend to waste their money and vacation because I screwed up and somehow the burden is on me to convince you I'm don't share this \"anyone who leaves friend behind is an AH\" mentality? Wild.", "Meh. The were travelling together. She was on the phone trying to 'get it sorted out' while the capable human who held her hand through every difficulty during the actual trip was right there, actively offering to help. \n\nIf she needs her brother for emotional support, then she puts the brother on speakerphone. If she's expecting support from her travelling companion, then she can't be excluding her from the crisis management discussion. OP had a flight in less than an hour, and if she's not going to loop OP on the plan when time is of the essence, then OP has to fend for herself, as she did. \n\nNTA", "I'd stop being friends with someone for being this irresponsible while traveling. OP is right to ditch her friend especially when her friend was doing nothing to communicate with her.\n\nTrips cost money! Why should OP be out a lot of money because her friend is acting like a child?", "Ffs. Thailand is not somalia. Her friend is an adult thought apparently without much common sense.", "If you\u2019re anything like OP\u2019s friend then good riddance.", "Nah, OP only *might* be an AH if the friend opened their mouth and explained why they really need OP to stay with them, offered to pay etc., and OP still left.

Wild.", "Yea that\u2019s the part a lot of people are missing. Unfortunately, it is not safe for a young woman to be alone in a foreign country. Thailand specifically has a massive sex trafficking problem and OP left a 19 year old women there alone because they didn\u2019t want to waste money. \n\nIm 23 , if I were OPs friend I would have offered to pay for at least part OPs accommodations or something but OP won\u2019t ever know if her friend was going to offer that because she didn\u2019t even consider staying behind.", "There\u2019s a ridiculous amount of 18-21 year olds traveling Thailand / Indonesia / vietnam by themselves. Including women\u2026 I think it\u2019s more of a ah move to have OP cancel her flight and itinerary for her friends carelessness. \n\nYou probably don\u2019t travel much if you think being alone in a foreign country like Thailand is sketchy\u2026 it\u2019s basically a rite of passage for travelers.", "Yeah the friend might have adhd or be autistic. You never know", "So what? You would have lost out on the trip you planned due to her irresponsibility and refusal to speak to you. Why did she not act this way with her other issues? She's trying to blame you for not mommying her during the trip. NTA", "Wrong. \n\nShe was on the phone. OP couldn\u2019t handle having to wait for a few minutes for her to get off the phone and had to have attention RIGHT NOW. That\u2019s what this is about. She is beyond rude and suffering from main character syndrome.", "i travel plenty, though mostly to the americas and west europe. heading to asia in a few days.\n\nOP's friend almost certainly hasn't traveled much. she screwed up booking stuff herself, she keeps misplacing her phone, her card was declined and had to borrow money from OP. she's a hot mess.\n\nbeing in that kind of situation she could become desperate and trust the wrong person.\n\nyou think getting roofied, kidnapped, etc., isn't a problem in thailand?\n\ni'm glad nothing particularly bad has happened to you in your travels, but shit happens all the time--both abroad and domestically.", "tbh even North Korea would be relatively safe with your tour guide and all", "What, exactly, did I say that was wrong?\n\n>OP couldn\u2019t handle having to wait for a few minutes for her to get off the phone and had to have attention RIGHT NOW. That\u2019s what this is about.\n\nNo, that's not what this is about. OP had a flight in an hour and her travelling companion was refusing to talk to her. Having a flight in an hour is an hour past when you should have passed the security check point. Every minute is a minute you might spend in a line or running to a gate, and if you're 1 minute past door close, you're SOL. You speak like someone who's never flown before.", "I've traveled as a single woman extensively in latam, USA, Asia etc. You just need to be more careful.", "Why is it inadvisable? Most women who solo travel have a great time. There is always risk to travel, but life solely isn't about avoiding risk.\n\nYou can spend your whole life in the small town you grew up in, that still doesn't mean you can't be assaulted.", "It sounds like OPs friend doesn\u2019t have street smarts, so just telling her to be careful doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019d be effective", "Such a weird fucking statement. Women who have been assaulted, killed, or trafficked just needed to be more careful? Get a grip.", "If her friend is stupid, she is not responsible for that stupidity and lack of sense.", "Maybe she is just weaponising her incompetence.", "Sounds like you've never been out of your town on your own.", "I swear that\u2019s one of Reddit\u2019s favorite things. Maybe she\u2019s having a panic attack because traveling isn\u2019t what she pictured it to be. Maybe OP has been rushing her the entire trip and has caused her to misstep and forget things. Maybe she was assaulted and is too embarrassed to say anything about it. \nThe point is you don\u2019t know. What we do know is that an unreliable narrator laid out a story from their perspective and it still makes them look like an asshole.", "At least you can think critically enough to realize that."]}
