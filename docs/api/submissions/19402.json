She was allergic to cats. I had always had pets growing up and wanted to have one again. We had some outdoor cats that I often fed and always liked to pet. I never let them in while my roommate lived here. The week she left I let one in and the cat was so happy. I had to help him out. I gave him a bath, got him fixed and he is now a very pampered prince living mostly inside with me. She was going to come back in two weeks to pick up the last bit of her things, but I promised myself that I would clean up before she came and vacuum as much cat hair as possible (not that he sheds that much). I did not tell her I was getting the cat, I had an incredible two weeks with the cat. Before she came back, I gave the cat to a friend to watch over so there wouldn\u2019t be extra dander in the apartment. Mind you I kept my roommates door closed so the cat would not go in. She comes back and if you\u2019ve ever had a cat, you know there\u2019s always a slight smell and slight dander. She immediately starts asking questions as her eyes get puffy. I told her I got a cat, but it has not gone in her room and I tried to vacuum as much as possible, and I even got her allergy meds. She did not have a bed, So she was expecting to sleep on the couch. The cat had been laying on the couch the past two weeks. I got her an air mattress and put it in her room though. We went on the porch so she could breathe a little bit better. She then proceeded to yell at me of how selfish I was, and how inconsiderate I was. I told her she had moved, and I was doing her a favor by letting her store stuff at my place.

Wtf is up with giving the cat away and trying to hide it? Like, of course it blew up in your face. This could\u2019ve been entirely avoided if you communicated better.", "I gotta say NTA.  Once it became just your place, you could do what you want.  But, it would have been considerate to tell her about the cat if you knew she was planning to sleep there when she came back for the rest of her stuff.", "NTA. She doesn't live there anymore. Your house, your rules.\n\nCongrats on the kitty! :)", "NTA\n\n\"Ex\" roommate.\n\nYou were very considerate trying to accommodate her overall.\n\nLife is a series of people entering and leaving your life. She's leaving your life and had no right to yell at you.

You were being nice by letting her store stuff in your apartment to begin with. Her getting mad at you for not continuing to live your life like she was still there is incredibly selfish of her. Enjoy your new cat.", "NTA, she isn't your roommate anymore and she isn't in the place to tell you what to do, if you decide to have a cat, it's none of her business", "A tad the AH. She did move out, but she still had stuff over. You both knew she was  going to speed at least one night at your place, to pack her things. i'd have.told her i've gotten Mr. Purrs after she moved out. Absolutely NTA there, as he is well looked after.\n\nTA, as she should have been informed. Cat hair gets even under closed doors, unless said doors are an airlock system.\n\nMy cat says mewbe, definitely ^^", "Why wouldn't you tell her you had a cat if you knew she was planning on *staying the night*? YTA for that. She could've made other plans", "NTA.  She moved out.  To another state.  You are free to adopt a cat if you wish.  It was kind of an AH move not to tell her about the cat before she came to visit, though.", "YTA. \n\nShe had moved out so you were totally within your rights to get a cat, but you had told her she could store stuff with you *and* stay with you, knowing she was allergic. Basic human decency was to inform her before you got the cat so that she could make other arrangements for both her stuff and her stay. \n\nYou say you guys had to go outside so she could breath better - that indicates a pretty extreme allergic reaction. Typically with that kind of reaction she would have had to be on allergy meds for days before her visit to mitigate it, and even then would be risking a reaction. It\u2019s not as simple as her popping a Benadryl or you doing some vacuuming. You put her health at risk.", "Doesn\u2019t matter how much you vacuum. The thing causing the allergy is a protein in the cat\u2019s dandruff, it\u2019s microscopic and floating around in the air wherever a cat lives.

You're allowed to have a cat", "NTA.  When someone moves out, they don't get a say in what happens to the place.", "It\u2019s a very nuanced situation obviously but I\u2019m siding with YTA. I understand she wasn\u2019t entitled to leaving her stuff there and you were also totally in the right for giving the cat a home right away. But these allergies can become very dangerous even when they previously weren\u2019t a big deal. You should have informed her earlier and let her decide whether she wants to collect her stuff right away or maybe even just as much as take meds before coming to your place.", "Yta not for getting a cat, thats fine. But not telling someone who is allergic and whonyou *knew* planned to sleep on the couch?  You should have told her so she could get a hotel room!", "NTA. As you say, she stored her stuff with you. You had no obligation to keep the household dander free. (And btw, vacuuming a lot before a visit by someone allergic just spreads the dander around and makes it worse.)", "YTA. \n\nYou knew she was coming back to get the rest of her stuff and that she would have to sleep on the couch where the cat slept.\n\nYou should have waited until she was totally moved out to let the cat in, or at least tell her that you got \u00e0 cat so she could take the medication before getting to your place or find other accomodations.", "Everyone said she couldn't wait until she was fully moved out to get one. She LET one in that was outdoors. Idc, if she still had stuff there, op also got an air mattress since the roommate wanted to sleep on the couch originally. Sorry, she didn't bring it to a rescue place, but she saw a cat in need and took care of it. She didn't let it in the roomates old room. Honestly, to me, she did everything right, although I agree with others that she could've let her know prior to her coming over", "NTA. Once it was no longer her apartment, then it was yours. \n\nI am assuming she\u2019s no longer paying rent. I might feel differently if she was still paying rent while storing her stuff there and coming back to stay was taking advantage of the room she was paying for. \n\nI think you probably should\u2019ve been more up front with her that a cat was in the apartment so she\u2019d know she couldn\u2019t stay there and should get her stuff out sooner than later. That would have been the right thing to do if she\u2019s your friend. But still, NTA.", "YTA. If you had told her you had a cat, she could have changed plans and slept somewhere else, then get her stuff while on Benadryl and with a mask.\n\nI'm allergic too and can't imagine sleeping in a couch that a cat was in. AND I like cats. But it would be hell on Erth. \n\nOnce I was visiting a friend with three cats, who was literally dying, so not visiting was not an option. Got Benadryl, mask, but somehow my eye itched and I put my finger on it. Dude. My face swelled thrice its size, and the eye was closed because of the swelling.\n\nOk, darkest humor on Earth now. We decided to take the dying friend to a clinic and she agreed. Four people arrived there: the friend, rail thin, looking jaundiced and weak; her husband, who had a wobbly walk because of a cerebellum injury: me, with a huge swollen face and one eye closed; and another friend who's afraid of elevator and ran 9 floors to reach us, so breathless and red. \n\nPeople at the waiting room were baffled as to whom they should offer their seats! Four of us looking sick in very different ways. Quite a sight.", "YTA for doing it when you knew she was coming. Not sure why you couldn\u2019t wait until she was completely moved out.", "YTA you knowingly contaminated the space you knew she\u2019d have to be exposed to, so incredibly selfish", "NTA. The cat-hater is TA.", "NTa", "If she'd moved out, and was no longer paying rent, then she has no grounds to be upset.\n\nIf she was still paying rent (and it sounds like she might have been, given that her room and stuff were still there) then YTA - she's still a tenant, and still has the right to live there, and you knowingly moved a cat (which you knew she was allergic to) in to the common space that she pays for.\n\nSo it depends on when she stopped paying for the place.", "Mild YTA. You\u2019re totally have the right to own a cat as your former roommate doesn\u2019t live there anymore, however if you knew she left stuff there and was coming back, you could\u2019ve waited to bring the cat in or at least give your roommate a heads up that there\u2019s a cat in vicinity now since she has allergies.", "NTA.

You knew your ex-roommate was coming back and needed a place to sleep, and you knew that she didn't have bed furniture in her room to stay in, leaving the couch as the only option. As a host, you either provide safe accommodations, or you're honest about the fact that you can't, favor to her or not. \n\n You put your roommate in an unhealthy situation by lying by omission.

A friend's quilt she brought with her baby was enough to set his allergies because the cat had sat on it right before she left for our home, and his eyes and throat swelled up within 5 minutes of exposure. \n\nYour friend has a right to be pissed at this.

You just let her eyes get puffy before admitting you allowed your friend, whom you\u2019re supposed to care about, into a living space of a cat. You mentioned that you went out on the porch so she could breathe better. Does that mean that she gets an asthma attack around cats, or a runny nose? If she has asthma, then you risked her life. If her eyes get puffy and she gets a runny nose, then she\u2019ll probably look like she had a massive crying jag for days. That\u2019s just grand, for her to look and feel like that while she\u2019s in town. If you put her in a situation where she had breathing problems, then that\u2019s a terrible thing to do. I used to work with someone who was deathly allergic to cats. Hugging someone who owned a cat could bring on a major asthma attack for him. For some people, allergies are serious.\n\nIf you wanted the cat, all you had to do was either put her things in storage, or wait two more weeks to bring him home. I hope you got him tested for toxoplasmosis, FIV, and FeLV. Cats that are allowed outside can spread those diseases to other cats. If you bring him in, then you should consider keeping him in. If he hasn\u2019t caught toxoplasmosis yet outside, he eventually will, and then he\u2019ll bring that parasite to you in his litter box. Outdoor cats also kill songbirds.\n\nI love cats, and have one, myself, who was born on the street. He\u2019s a house kitty. If he got out, he\u2019d get eaten by a coyote, bobcat, or mountain lion. If you live in a suburb or city, then your cat could get hit by a car.\n\nIn my personal opinion, pet cats are healthier, and live longer, as strictly indoor pets, with perhaps a catio or other enclosed pen to get some sunshine.\n\nThe friends of people with allergies, or other health issues, should make an effort to protect them.

This is NOT about the cat - this is about your entire blatant disregard for someone you call your friend!! I say this as someone with a moderate to severe cat allergy.

Dude. You accepting the responsibility of storing her items. You agreed to it and you did not have to. Regardless of if the door is closed, there\u2019s still cat hair moving around. It is likely on her things and she may not be able to keep some things because of the dander. You did not give her the opportunity to set boundaries regarding her things and this cat that, even as a favor, you accepted responsibility for. If you\u2019d have given her a heads up, she could\u2019ve found alternate storage options or picked things up earlier, but you made a unilateral decision that affected more than just you. You accepted the responsibility to keep her items safe and you invited her into your home that she physically is not safe in. \n\nHer eyes puffed up immediately after you cleaned and no cat was present - it\u2019s incredible she was able to stay the whole night, but I know she didn\u2019t sleep well!

In contrast, my friends literally wash their clothes/put on recently washed clothes that the cats haven\u2019t sat on and put whatever blankets they used in my washing machine before leaving so I don\u2019t have to risk touching the dander. This isn\u2019t something I requested, but it\u2019s so nice having friends who put the thought into not exposing me to dander! \n\nYou crossed a boundary that, again, you didn\u2019t give her the opportunity to set because I guarantee she wouldn\u2019t have left things with you if she knew she couldn\u2019t trust you, and it\u2019s damaged your relationship.

You should not have agreed to keep her things if you were unwilling to maintain the typical cleanliness (/dander free) of your home.

But to not give any warning or even just wait an extra couple is just extremely inconsiderate. Your roommate might have wanted to make alternative arrangements for their belongings and accommodation when back in town (and almost certainly would have from the sounds of it). We have no clue if the allergens could have gotten onto their possessions and led to them needing a deep clean at best or at worst throwing out (I know you said you\u2019ve kept them out of her room but still, allergens can travel through vents or slits under doors etc).  All you had to do was text her or wait 2 weeks, I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t have wanted to stay if you\u2019d told her so I don\u2019t get why you didn\u2019t?

Your friend had to suffer for one night and suddenly you're the AH because she was too entitled and ignorant to come prepared? If her allergies were really that bad, she wouldn't go anywhere without her meds. As someone with an autoimmune disorder and eczema as well as many allergies I would never go stay overnight somewhere without bringing a few antihistamines, even if I know they don't have pets and house isn't dusty, etc. It's called being responsible for your own self.

One needs steroids, a rescue inhaler, and breathing treatments after cat exposure. The other needs a epipen then steroids and breathing treatments with hospitalization. She could have put her in danger not knowing how allergic she is. Ppl always think sniffles when they hear allergies or allergic. I get she was doing a favor but a warning could have been given allergies aren\u2019t something her friend has chose.

One of the latter friends once had to go to the ER after sleeping over at my place. We had slept in the basement where the cats didn't really go, and I'd deep-cleaned and vacuumed every carpet and fabric surface, worn freshly cleaned clothes that the cats hadn't touched, my friend took two Benadryl prior to arriving and prior to going to sleep, and it *still* wasn't enough. Her entire face was so swollen she couldn't drive and her throat was actively closing up as she left my house.

Were you deliberately hiding this fact?", "100%. Some people are deathly allergic to cats. I\u2019ve invited a friend to come watch a movie at my place and she has declined because literally stepping foot into my home could actually kill her.

If she\u2019d known I\u2019m sure she would have made other arrangements or done *some* sort of preparation.

Your friend has a serious allergy, you could have been way more respectful and considerate. If you had told her about the cat, she may have been able to make other arrangements for picking up her things, or perhaps take needed medication in preparation for being around a trigger.", "Im going full on YTA you cared more about bringin in a stray IMMEDIATELY than your friendship. She asked to leave her stuff for two weeks, and if you where gonna get a cat immediately you should have said no.\n\nThen when you got the cat anyway you should have called her to figure out something else with her stuff and where to stay when she came to get them.\n\nYou are a bad friend honestly.", "Nta.

My family members are all extremely allergic to cats, and they tend to be allergic to the saliva which if you have a cat you know it gets everywhere. I would\u2019ve probably told her you were getting the cat, and you\u2019d be giving her the option to be able to get the rest of the stuff now. It was kind to let her keep it there though, and she probably should\u2019ve expressed her feeling differently. It can also be hard to do while having a flare up though, so i would try to be a little understanding as should she should with you.", "YTA \n\nNot for getting a cat after she moved away but for not warning her that you got one when you told her she can come and sleep at your place.

They're awesome.\nAn allergy that's so severe she's having trouble breathing?  That's not a minor thing.  That's something you *warn* her about so she can make other plans and protect herself.\n\nAlso, you shouldn't vacuum for an allergy like that.  Instead, after you move the cat elsewhere, you spritz everything with a bit of water to keep dander from floating into the air while you clean and wipe everything down with a wet cloth. Follow gravity, so start with the tops of cabinets and doors (ceiling fan of you have one), then furniture, and finish with baseboards and carpet.\nAfter you have wiped up fur and dander by hand, you use a carpet scrubber on any carpet instead of a vacuum.  Again, it keeps dust and dander from floating in the air.  After that, you air the place out for half a day if possible.\n\nAnd for some people that will still not be enough to safely spend the night in a home where a cat has lived.", "NTA.

Especially if they're exposed to it over many hours. At this point the cat had been everywhere in the house (excluding the room) so your friend in theory was going to have to stay exclusively in one room and what never leave? Never get a drink? How did you think she'd get to her room without a reaction? If it's severe enough she couldn't breath and a visible reaction started immediately she has a severe life threatening allergy. Also how did you put the air mattress in the room without breaking the isolation of said room... Your plan here made no sense at all.This all could have been resolved with a quick text saying I've got a cat instead you let her risk her life by not preparing her.  You always need to inform people if they're going to encounter any allergens so they can make the choice themselves about how large a risk to life this poses. YTA and a poor cat parent at that,  part of being a good cat parent is being educated on the risk cats pose and making correct judgement calls", "YTA big time!

I am SO very allergic, and the amount of people that assume I\u2019m being dramatic and just suggest I take an allergy pill and that they can vacuum so it should be fine astounds me. I will just never come into your house rather than risk me ending up in the hospital. I\u2019ve tried ALL the suggestions that would supposedly make it okay for me, and none of them work. I\u2019m surprised she even stayed over night. If she was enough of a friend and OP cared enough about her to hold on to her stuff for her, but yet didn\u2019t care enough to let her know about the new furry room mate, OP is most deft TA.

Hiding the evidence hoping the guest wouldn't know isn't being considerate it's being shady. \n\nIf their intent was to adopt a cat 30 seconds after the roommate moved out, then don't say they could store things or stay in 2 weeks. \n\nAnd also they clearly aren't friends.", "No no understand the OP did EVERYTHING SHE COULD\n/s\n\nPeople are wild man. If you can't wait two weeks to get a cat jeez", "As I said, she should have told the friend. However, if you have an allergy it\u2019s smart to make sure you have what you need in case of a reaction. I keep my inhaler and allergy medicine in my car, or purse. There\u2019s cats everywhere, maybe it\u2019s just me but I like keeping them close.", "This is correct, OP is NTA for getting the cat but she should have warned the roommate.\n\nRoommate has moved out so she is now a houseguest. I think it is pretty standard courtesy to warn an allergic houseguest that you have a pet. That way if she isn\u00b4t comfortable sleeping on a sofa with cat hair on it then she could have  planned to sleep elsewhere.", "yeah this. i have had cat dander (and probably other allergens) close up my windpipe before just being in an apartment a cat lives in for like an hour or so, not even petting or touching the cat. When i stay or visit my friends, who all have cats, I have to prep by taking my heavy duty allergy meds at least a week or so before the visit and my friends super vacuum & run an air filter when i\u2019m over. My best friends have a cat free room too for guests since they have multiple with allergies. \n\nYTA. OP should have let the former roommate know about the cat so she could have made other arrangements. And tbh i\u2019ve only been in one house that SMELLED of cat despite all my friends having them- they had multiple cats, not enough boxes and a cat with a spraying problem. It should not have smelled of cat in the two weeks she was gone if OP cleaned as she said so there\u2019s another problem on top of the allergies", "Oh please just both childish not telling her about cat and other not talking anymore.", "It sounds like a stray or abandoned cat since it was friendly found her. They have a thick sense about who will pamper them and showed up right on time ..", ">unconsiderate\n\nlmao\n\nAlso, it's inconsiderate because you invited them to stay there and did not tell them about the cat. You're right, it's their house and they can have a cat if they want, but all they had to do was not lie by omission to the ex-roommate. \n\nIt's very clear OP thought \"I'll just vacuum and it'll be fine, they're overreacting\"\n\nMy aunt did this and my throat fucking closed.", "A lot of people don\u2019t \u201cbelieve\u201d in allergies unless they see a reaction. \n\nMight have something to do with it.", "Agree. She wasn\u2019t living there so you are free to get a cat.

However, if you were friends, that was a really crappy thing to do. \n\nAbsolutely, you should have given her heads up. \n\nIf you were a friend, you would have let her know you had a cat so she could make other arrangements.  Ideally you should have  waited to bring in the stray until she got back.  You could have also asked your friend that looked after the cat when your roommate came back to watch the cat for a few weeks.\n\nYou knew your roommate was coming back soon otherwise you wouldn't have agreed to let her keep her things there.  \n\nCat dander gets everywhere for people that are really allergic- it goes through AC vents. I have severe cat allergies - I get it.  \n\nTell your friend you're really sorry - you didn't realize how severe her allergies were and you didn't realize how much you'd miss her so you alleviated your loneliness by taking in a stray cat", "Let me know the next time you have a friend that\u2019s allergic to peanut butter and you spread it around their bed, wipe it up, then tell them it\u2019s cool to sleep there. She knew her friend was coming back to grab stuff. Obviously it\u2019s nice of them to let them keep stuff there, but that\u2019s what friends do.

That\u2019s seriously messed up to get that cat, even if she moved. If I was your friend, you would never see me again. Definitely TA.", "Exactly, so many people in this thread are like \"not the asshole you are in your right to have a cat\" yes we know she has the right to have a acat that's not what we are ralikg about.

She coulda moved her shit on moving day but got free storage from OP.", "I would still say YTA. Maybe not for getting the cat, but for not informing her.\n\nINFO: did you know how severe her allergies are?", "You did her no favors by not letting her know in advance that you'd gotten a cat. I know you tried to clean as best as possible, but step 1 should've been telling her. The girl couldn't even breathe properly inside.\n\nThis \"n t a \" is such a technical one. She's not on the lease, so screw her need to make informed decisions about her health, I guess./s Just because you're not technically in the wrong doesn't mean it wasn't inconsiderate of you.", "You were doing her the opposite of a favor. It would have been better to refuse to hold onto anything than to put her health at risk when she came back to pick those things up.", "Exactly! YTA for not telling!

For some people, including myself, allergic reactions from cats and dogs leaves my entire face swollen and i get rashes break out on my body. My breath shortens considerably and thats nothing on the eye itching, congestion, and consistent sneezing that leaves my entire body in aches from tensing up so much and so often. These are symptoms WITH medicine. I\u2019ve tried every allergy medicine in the book and nothing can reduce my symptoms more than that. After exposure, I always have to do breathing treatments multiple times until I feel normal again\u2026 as bad as you think your allergies are my friend, these allergy meds barely cover the real symptoms", "Correct she is allowed she is just an AH for doing it.", "Y T A\n\nOP should have at least told her, since the plan was for her to come back for a couple more days.

You really think it was OK for OP not to tell the 3x roommate about the cat in advance?", "I cannot believe this is even a topic of discussion. As a person with severe animal allergies, I NEVER expect someone else to keep my allergies under control for me. The fact that she had an air mattress and allergy meds for her friend is enough.

When your talking about other people\u2019s allergies, you play it extremely safe and make sure you don\u2019t trigger their allergy. That means you inform them of any potential contaminations so they can make their own decisions based on that information, and you do your best to make sure the allergen isn\u2019t present if they are an invited guest in your home. You wouldn\u2019t invite a person who is allergic to shellfish and then make a seafood fish, and expect them to eat it cause their last reaction was mild.
