She was allergic to cats. I had always had pets growing up and wanted to have one again. We had some outdoor cats that I often fed and always liked to pet. I never let them in while my roommate lived here. The week she left I let one in and the cat was so happy. I had to help him out. I gave him a bath, got him fixed and he is now a very pampered prince living mostly inside with me. She was going to come back in two weeks to pick up the last bit of her things, but I promised myself that I would clean up before she came and vacuum as much cat hair as possible (not that he sheds that much). I did not tell her I was getting the cat, I had an incredible two weeks with the cat. Before she came back, I gave the cat to a friend to watch over so there wouldn\u2019t be extra dander in the apartment. Mind you I kept my roommates door closed so the cat would not go in. She comes back and if you\u2019ve ever had a cat, you know there\u2019s always a slight smell and slight dander. She immediately starts asking questions as her eyes get puffy. I told her I got a cat, but it has not gone in her room and I tried to vacuum as much as possible, and I even got her allergy meds. She did not have a bed, So she was expecting to sleep on the couch. The cat had been laying on the couch the past two weeks. I got her an air mattress and put it in her room though. We went on the porch so she could breathe a little bit better. She then proceeded to yell at me of how selfish I was, and how inconsiderate I was. I told her she had moved, and I was doing her a favor by letting her store stuff at my place. She stayed one night and then left when she was supposed to stay two night.

Wtf is up with giving the cat away and trying to hide it? Like, of course it blew up in your face. This could\u2019ve been entirely avoided if you communicated better.", "I gotta say NTA.  Once it became just your place, you could do what you want.  But, it would have been considerate to tell her about the cat if you knew she was planning to sleep there when she came back for the rest of her stuff.", "NTA. She doesn't live there anymore. Your house, your rules.\n\nCongrats on the kitty! :)", "NTA\n\n\"Ex\" roommate.\n\nYou were very considerate trying to accommodate her overall.\n\nLife is a series of people entering and leaving your life. She's leaving your life and had no right to yell at you. Seriously, benadryl is a thing you can buy.\n\nIt's up to her at this point to demonstrate she wants to maintain a relationship with you.\n\nIf she doesn't reach out - let her go and enjoy your new kitty.", "NTA. You were being nice by letting her store stuff in your apartment to begin with. Her getting mad at you for not continuing to live your life like she was still there is incredibly selfish of her. Enjoy your new cat.", "NTA, she isn't your roommate anymore and she isn't in the place to tell you what to do, if you decide to have a cat, it's none of her business, you are not in the guilt especially if you have apologized", "A tad the AH. She did move out, but she still had stuff over. You both knew she was  going to speed at least one night at your place, to pack her things. i'd have.told her i've gotten Mr. Purrs after she moved out. Absolutely NTA there, as he is well looked after.\n\nTA, as she should have been informed. Cat hair gets even under closed doors, unless said doors are an airlock system.\n\nMy cat says mewbe, definitely ^^", "Why wouldn't you tell her you had a cat if you knew she was planning on *staying the night*? YTA for that. She could've made other plans", "NTA.  She moved out.  To another state.  You are free to adopt a cat if you wish.

Basic human decency was to inform her before you got the cat so that she could make other arrangements for both her stuff and her stay. \n\nYou say you guys had to go outside so she could breath better - that indicates a pretty extreme allergic reaction. Typically with that kind of reaction she would have had to be on allergy meds for days before her visit to mitigate it, and even then would be risking a reaction. It\u2019s not as simple as her popping a Benadryl or you doing some vacuuming. You put her health at risk.", "Doesn\u2019t matter how much you vacuum. The thing causing the allergy is a protein in the cat\u2019s dandruff, it\u2019s microscopic and floating around in the air wherever a cat lives.

You're allowed to have a cat", "NTA.  When someone moves out, they don't get a say in what happens to the place.", "It\u2019s a very nuanced situation obviously but I\u2019m siding with YTA. I understand she wasn\u2019t entitled to leaving her stuff there and you were also totally in the right for giving the cat a home right away. But these allergies can become very dangerous even when they previously weren\u2019t a big deal. You should have informed her earlier and let her decide whether she wants to collect her stuff right away or maybe even just as much as take meds before coming to your place.", "Yta not for getting a cat, thats fine. But not telling someone who is allergic and whonyou *knew* planned to sleep on the couch?  You should have told her so she could get a hotel room!", "NTA. As you say, she stored her stuff with you. You had no obligation to keep the household dander free. (And btw, vacuuming a lot before a visit by someone allergic just spreads the dander around and makes it worse.)", "YTA. \n\nYou knew she was coming back to get the rest of her stuff and that she would have to sleep on the couch where the cat slept.\n\nYou should have waited until she was totally moved out to let the cat in, or at least tell her that you got \u00e0 cat so she could take the medication before getting to your place or find other accomodations.", "Everyone said she couldn't wait until she was fully moved out to get one. She LET one in that was outdoors. Idc, if she still had stuff there, op also got an air mattress since the roommate wanted to sleep on the couch originally. Sorry, she didn't bring it to a rescue place, but she saw a cat in need and took care of it. She didn't let it in the roomates old room. Honestly, to me, she did everything right, although I agree with others that she could've let her know prior to her coming over", "NTA. Once it was no longer her apartment, then it was yours. \n\nI am assuming she\u2019s no longer paying rent. I might feel differently if she was still paying rent while storing her stuff there and coming back to stay was taking advantage of the room she was paying for. \n\nI think you probably should\u2019ve been more up front with her that a cat was in the apartment so she\u2019d know she couldn\u2019t stay there and should get her stuff out sooner than later. That would have been the right thing to do if she\u2019s your friend. But still, NTA.", "YTA. If you had told her you had a cat, she could have changed plans and slept somewhere else, then get her stuff while on Benadryl and with a mask.\n\nI'm allergic too and can't imagine sleeping in a couch that a cat was in. AND I like cats. But it would be hell on Erth. \n\nOnce I was visiting a friend with three cats, who was literally dying, so not visiting was not an option. Got Benadryl, mask, but somehow my eye itched and I put my finger on it. Dude. My face swelled thrice its size, and the eye was closed because of the swelling.\n\nOk, darkest humor on Earth now. We decided to take the dying friend to a clinic and she agreed. Four people arrived there: the friend, rail thin, looking jaundiced and weak; her husband, who had a wobbly walk because of a cerebellum injury: me, with a huge swollen face and one eye closed; and another friend who's afraid of elevator and ran 9 floors to reach us, so breathless and red. \n\nPeople at the waiting room were baffled as to whom they should offer their seats! Four of us looking sick in very different ways. Quite a sight.", "YTA for doing it when you knew she was coming. Not sure why you couldn\u2019t wait until she was completely moved out.", "YTA you knowingly contaminated the space you knew she\u2019d have to be exposed to, so incredibly selfish", "NTA. The cat-hater is TA.", "NTa", "If she'd moved out, and was no longer paying rent, then she has no grounds to be upset.\n\nIf she was still paying rent (and it sounds like she might have been, given that her room and stuff were still there) then YTA - she's still a tenant, and still has the right to live there, and you knowingly moved a cat (which you knew she was allergic to) in to the common space that she pays for.\n\nSo it depends on when she stopped paying for the place.", "Mild YTA. You\u2019re totally have the right to own a cat as your former roommate doesn\u2019t live there anymore, however if you knew she left stuff there and was coming back, you could\u2019ve waited to bring the cat in or at least give your roommate a heads up that there\u2019s a cat in vicinity now since she has allergies.", "NTA.

You knew your ex-roommate was coming back and needed a place to sleep, and you knew that she didn't have bed furniture in her room to stay in, leaving the couch as the only option. As a host, you either provide safe accommodations, or you're honest about the fact that you can't, favor to her or not. \n\n You put your roommate in an unhealthy situation by lying by omission. My husband can't breathe when he touches anything that's touched cat hair. A friend's quilt she brought with her baby was enough to set his allergies because the cat had sat on it right before she left for our home, and his eyes and throat swelled up within 5 minutes of exposure. \n\nYour friend has a right to be pissed at this.

Two more weeks without an indoor cat wasn\u2019t gonna kill her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo OP, YTA.", "It\u2019s inconsiderate when you have agreed to store a few things for someone for 2 weeks who is allergic to cats and also you agreed to let stay over the night knowing they  are allergic to cats. Had this been months after the move that would be one thing but this was right after. Is OP allowed to get a cat?  Yes. Is she also an asshole?  Also yes. All she had to do was wait two weeks for when ex roommates things were gone, especially as dander spreads and it\u2019s likely ex roommates things got dander on them.", "my mother needs an inhaler for her allergy because if she\u2019s in contact with a cat her throat will literally constrict so that can no longer breathe. my allergy is the same way, though luckily not that extreme (yet).", "Your attitude should be as well, but here we are.", "> It definitely is as simple as popping a benadryl\n\nActually, we can read. You made a statement of FACT about how the roommates allergies would react because of how your allergies work. That's super dumb.", "So because you\u2019re willing to be miserable, everyone with pet allergies has to be willing to be miserable?"]}
