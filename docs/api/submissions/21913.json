While you probably should have anticipated that she would take all night it really isn't acceptable to do that every night, and you are fully within your rights to be upset that she is uncommunicative and doing this nightly. These are not your children you shouldn't be taking care of them that often. I'd make it clear to your sister that while you're happy she's found someone new, it is unacceptable to have you take care of her kids that often. Scale back when you're willing to look after her kids to once a week if not less.\n\nAlso not really relevant but her calling them dick appointments really rubs me the wrong way, makes it seem like she doesn't actually care for this person outside of sex and I can't help but wonder if the guy she's seeing knows how she sees him.", "NTA - A text takes less than 30 seconds to send.

She can't just bail. Not answering was an AH move, because what if she'd been driving home hours earlier but got in a wreck? She should have answered just for your peace of mind. Then top it all off with not bringing you food? Total AH move.", "actually, INFO: rther are a few things you may want to clear up for people to be able to make an assessment. such as:  \n1. how old are you, that you need someone to get you food? or are you short on money?\n\n2. did she make sure the kids had something to eat? Anything around the house?\n\n3. did you even try to put the kids to bed?\n\n4. Is she paying you enough to be satisfied with the pay without her getting you food?\n\n5.

Maybe I\u2019m missing some of the information but sounds like you both needed to communicate how long she was supposed to be out till. If she told you she\u2019d be out all night and you accepted payment, kind of is what it is. Moms deserve self care too, even if it\u2019s in the form of a dick appointment. That\u2019s sad, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s cool for her to be doing this on the regular to her kids. Regardless what you two agree to, the kids didn\u2019t get a vote and they matter most of all in this scenario.", "NTA.

You could probably bring up the issues and set boundaries without snapping. But I get it. You're being more of an adult than she is. It's tough, because the kids sound like they're in a precarious situation having a mom like that. Kind of scary honestly. You deserve to have your boundaries and needs respected.
