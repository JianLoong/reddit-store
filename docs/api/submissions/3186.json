We bantered back and forth that I needed to wear some for jokes about gorging on holiday food. My sis wanted me to actually do it so she could post a video but I don't even like having my picture taken so I declined.\n\nUnbeknownst to me, my sis had apparently brought a pair of hers and told my stepmom that I agreed to do it beforehand, so when I said no my stepmom joined in trying to make me do it. I sorta got angry after they kept pushing it infront of everyone and calling me chicken. I said no and to drop it. My initials are KW, my stepmoms are AM. And there is this whole sham of my dad saying \"she's my wife and the mother of your other siblings, so she's your mother too\" which I take issue with because she's obviously not so I don't like calling her that but I get yelled at if I don't, but when I'm not around them I call her by real her name instead.\n\nApparently saying no made her upset enough to yell (not real names) \"Kevin William! You get your other word for behind in here and do this!\" I responded \"Anita Marie! No and back the f off about it!\" The look on her face seemed like I just spit in her food. She blew up, and said that I wasn't so grown that she couldn't still whip me. I said you can try, but you won't get very far. Her and my dad both started in with how I'm so disrespectful by calling her real name instead of mom. And infront of the whole family no less.\n\nIt ended up with me leaving after telling them to grow up and stop thinking she's something that she's not now, ever has, or ever will be. Now I'm getting texts from them demanding I apologize and make it up to her by still doing the video skit. Still not doing it btw, and I don't feel like I need to do anything to appease her. The family is torn on both sides about it.

Your sister, stepmom and father sound like the kind of people that caused friendsgiving to become a thing.", "NTA. **You are always allowed to say \"no\" to something.

If this is real, you can\u2019t go NC fast enough. Who escalates sth like this to *threatening assault*? Who takes the side of someone like that?", "NTA and recommend you make plans for Christmas elsewhere too, since it's unlikely this is going to smooth out anytime soon.  It's just amazing how unrealistically entitled and demanding families believe the amount of control they believe they can threaten their adult children with childhood physical punishment and abuse.", "NTA\n\nAnd thats bullying.\n\nYou are ABSOLUTELY within your right to NOT do something like that, which you dont want to do. And they are ABSOLUTELY in the wrong to try and force you - even to the point of your step mother (NOT your mother!) pulling the 'Im your parent and you will do as I say' using your full name for emphasis. And to threaten to whip you?? Nope Nope and REALLY Nope.!\n\nTHAT is Aholeness !\n\nLastly, because she is NOT your Mother, you do NOT have to call her that. You have a Mother and its not her. If she is going to get so butt hurt over what you call her, then she really needs to grow up. 'Mother' is a label, not a feeling - and you are never going to have that feeling for HER, whether you call her that or not.\n\nYou do not owe her or anyone else an apology. Nor do you have to do the video.", "NTA.  Dad's wife does not equal mom, unless that wife gave birth to you.  You're 27 years old. Your dad and his shitty wife have to learn that they can't boss you around anymore like you're a child.", "Wow. These people are bizarre. NTA.", "There\u2019s a few a$$holes involved but you were not one of them.  Your stepmom seems like she needs medication.", "NTA\n\nThey\u2019re insisting that you, a 27yo adult, call your stepmother \u2018mom\u2019?

Both your sister and your step-mom can put on the pants and make their own skits and videos if they want to, but tell them to leave you out of it.  You have already declined, and no means NO.", "Wow.. NTA, we've seen more of these stepmother stories here: you can't force titles like dad/mom on your kids.\n\nSad you lost your calm but they just shouldn't have pushed so hard...", "NTA, your family sounds toxic.", "NTA", "NTA spit in their food", "NTA. No is a complete sentence. She pushed, she got what she deserved", "NTA. You get to say no to the stupid thing. But you also get to choose how you, an adult, relate to this adult woman. If they want you to call her mom, she has to earn it from you.", "NTA and really your 27 years old and your absolutely in the right here she's not your mom never will be. And you need to tell all of them you will go no contact if they keep up with the crap. Another thing why not just do the friendsgiving and maybe not do Christmas this year to make it clear that you have boundaries and that you are an adult and going no contact is very possible", "You're 27 and they're still demanding you call her mom?

Then, yeah, I will go with YTA. Not because of the full name thing, I think that's silly, you are an adult, you choose how to call other adults. Based on the use of the word at her, at her place, with invites and what not around, that's disrespectful. For what it's worth, I would also thought YTA had you said \"f*off, beloved mom\" or whatever"]}
