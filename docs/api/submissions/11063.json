Dawn lives alone, does not have a license, and works full time. I work full time as well, I have a car and make significantly more money than Dawn. From the start of our friendship/ any relationship I am in I\u2019ve always been someone who doesn\u2019t mind picking up the tab, driving, hosting, cooking, etc., and do these things without any expectation of anything in return. As my love language is acts of service and giving. \n\nWithin the last year of our friendship I\u2019ve noticed Dawn stopped bringing cash out, when we went out. I thought this was rude so started asking for split bills, every time I did this Dawn would make it known how \u201cpoor\u201d she is and I noticed her bringing up financials all the time. This made me uncomfortable and honestly annoyed because Dawn is not poor, Dawn just lives like she\u2019s a millionaire, Ubers everywhere, doordash every meal, Starbucks everyday, going out to the bar every night, etc. \n\nOn Friday Dawn and I went out and I drove us( like I always do), paid for dinner and a drink, then took us home and we continued drinking at her place. A few hours later Dawn asks if I wanted to get pizza delivered I said sure. With the promo she had the pizza costs 15$ish dollars delivery charge included and when it arrived she told me I wasn\u2019t allowed to have a slice until I venmo her $7.50. I don\u2019t know why this is when I snapped, but I did and I told her it hurts my feelings that I feel like I do a lot for her and this is ridiculous. She then says \u201cI\u2019m poor and you\u2019re rich\u201d and then I really snapped and told her that she\u2019s not poor, she\u2019s broke. - I said this because she makes good money, she\u2019s just fucking terrible with it.  For info - I do make a significant amount more than her and maybe that makes me the asshole. I also don\u2019t feel great about throwing the things I\u2019ve done for her in the past in her face during this argument, as I really did do those out of love and never with the intentions of anything in return.

Do it only with people who are of the same mindset. Mindset doesn't mean they need to be of the same income level or even that they match your generosity 1:1 by picking up the tab every other time...no, rather that they make the offer (and are genuinely willing to pay) on some occasions and do not have an expectation that you'll pick up the tab.

I don't have a lot of friends to begin with but the ones I have we have been friends since grade school. This was a huge problem for me in my younger years because I wanted to do things that my friends could not afford. I had issues with them on stuff like this over pizza where everyone needed to have the money to them before they would order. Going to concerts I would want the best seats but they could only afford the nosebleeds. When i was young I felt kind of taken advantage off.\\\\\n\nNow that I'm older I don't think they where taken advantage but the income disparity almost put us at different levels. For example a 15 dollar pizza is nothing to me but some of my friends might only have 30 bucks in the bank until they get paid. Why would I put one of my friends in a shitty position over a 15 buck pizza. Its easier for me to just buy it. Kind of the same thing with concert tickets. If there was a show I wanted to see badly I would just pay the difference between there ticket and mine.\n\nI don't feel that I'm being mooched off but why should I not use money to make everyone I know life a little easier.

But then don\u2019t say you\u2019re poor. Poor and broke are very different. \n\nI am totally open to opposing opinions on this because this is a huge reason why I got so upset that night!", "Sadly, that seems to be the consensus, which really is a bummer because we have spent a lot of good times laughing/talking together and it hurts to know I was maybe just being used - this really sucks haha", "NTA. this \u201cfriend\u201d is using you.
