As my love language is acts of service and giving. \n\nWithin the last year of our friendship I\u2019ve noticed Dawn stopped bringing cash out, when we went out. I thought this was rude so started asking for split bills, every time I did this Dawn would make it known how \u201cpoor\u201d she is and I noticed her bringing up financials all the time. This made me uncomfortable and honestly annoyed because Dawn is not poor, Dawn just lives like she\u2019s a millionaire, Ubers everywhere, doordash every meal, Starbucks everyday, going out to the bar every night, etc. \n\nOn Friday Dawn and I went out and I drove us( like I always do), paid for dinner and a drink, then took us home and we continued drinking at her place. A few hours later Dawn asks if I wanted to get pizza delivered I said sure. With the promo she had the pizza costs 15$ish dollars delivery charge included and when it arrived she told me I wasn\u2019t allowed to have a slice until I venmo her $7.50. I don\u2019t know why this is when I snapped, but I did and I told her it hurts my feelings that I feel like I do a lot for her and this is ridiculous. She then says \u201cI\u2019m poor and you\u2019re rich\u201d and then I really snapped and told her that she\u2019s not poor, she\u2019s broke. - I said this because she makes good money, she\u2019s just fucking terrible with it.  For info - I do make a significant amount more than her and maybe that makes me the asshole. I also don\u2019t feel great about throwing the things I\u2019ve done for her in the past in her face during this argument, as I really did do those out of love and never with the intentions of anything in return.

I had issues with them on stuff like this over pizza where everyone needed to have the money to them before they would order. Going to concerts I would want the best seats but they could only afford the nosebleeds. When i was young I felt kind of taken advantage off.\\\\\n\nNow that I'm older I don't think they where taken advantage but the income disparity almost put us at different levels. For example a 15 dollar pizza is nothing to me but some of my friends might only have 30 bucks in the bank until they get paid. Why would I put one of my friends in a shitty position over a 15 buck pizza. Its easier for me to just buy it. Kind of the same thing with concert tickets. If there was a show I wanted to see badly I would just pay the difference between there ticket and mine.\n\nI don't feel that I'm being mooched off but why should I not use money to make everyone I know life a little easier.

I\u2019m sorry your friend sucks.", ">Where's that same energy when OP was giving her free food and fronting the bill? A free ride?\n\nSo you're saying OP should be expecting things back?\n\nOP literally said they pay for things without expectation that it should returned. But that seems like dishonesty since, both OP and you, think that there IS expectations and obligations.\n\nOP needs to be clearer with the boundaries around this and stop paying for everything and then getting taken advantage of.", "It\u2019s also the smallest thing anyone could ever post on this subreddit, but you are making it into a friendship-ender, which suggests a long and deep history of resentment that you failed to resolve over a long period of time due to a lack of communication.", "We met in university, Dawn ended up dropping out and immediately was hired as a sales associate at Apple, through the years I finished my studies she worked her way up to a Manager Position, where she\u2019s told me her salary/any time she gets a raise multiple times. (Which I\u2019m fine with telling me about a raise, and I\u2019m happy for her when that happens) I\u2019ve been in the work force now for two years and know I make more, because she\u2019s told me on multiple occasions what her wage is.", "Okay, well thank you so much for your response! at least I know I\u2019m not alone in the guilt feeling and perhaps it\u2019s even semi normal. I do think I need to do some more reflecting on this situation and be a little bit more stern.", "I can relate to that totally. Also, your username gave me a good laugh, that I desperately needed. \ud83d\ude02 thank you", "Totally agree I needed to calm down from that situation and get some fresh eyes! I have tried to talk to her since and I\u2019m getting the vibe that the only way she\u2019ll want this friendship to continue is if I apologize\u2026 which I\u2019m fine to apologize, I\u2019m just now realizing that an argument like this will inevitably happen again, in some way shape or form.", "I believe so", "No what I'm saying is it's clear her friend is taking advantage of OPs generosity. Literally told OP that because they make more theyre expected to pay for when they go out AND for when they're offered food. That's clear entitlement. \n\nI think anyone in this situation would've been more than happy to pay for the pizza themselves, as friends do. They take care of each other. OPs friend is a clear moocher and literally spelled it out for her. \n\nStopped bringing money when they went out to places and then literally told her \"Well you make more so I'm justified.\" \n\nAnd again the friend is an ass for HOW they also asked. \"You're barred from eating UNTIL you Venmo me money.\" \n\nShe's a shitty friend and i understand why OP blew up in the situation as it is a fucking ridiculous thing to say to someone after you've offered to buy food. OP even feels guilty about it. \n\nSo yeah. The friend is an asshole and OP got fed up about it. Maybe she should've drawn boundaries a lot sooner but i think her friend has shown her true colors and OP should at the very least stop footing the bill for them in the future.\n\nI don't understand how \"Well you were nice so that's your fault.\" even a thing.\n\nEdit: it's one thing to not be able to afford to treat your friends the way they treat you... It's another thing to tell them \"you make more and are better at finances so i expect you to take care of everything we do\"", "It\u2019s weird that she is sharing such private info with a non-partner, but that is her choice I suppose. Next time she tells you how you make more money than her, just tell her that she doesn\u2019t know your financial situation, you don\u2019t appreciate her assuming what you can and can\u2019t afford and let her know that you can\u2019t afford to keep buying for her (even if you can afford it AND if you two do continue being friends). While being a leech is generally gross, its even more gross to just decide that someone has more money than you and use your uninformed judgment to justify being said leech."]}
