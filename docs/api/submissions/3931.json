I\u2019ve met about 90% of the group in person at least once, but since it\u2019s an open group there are bound to be people I haven\u2019t seen before. Everyone is generally very pleasant, and it\u2019s a great way to find events. \n\nMost of the group went to a concert together last night, which left behind a couple of stragglers who had appointments, or like me, are mildly claustrophobic and hate big crowds. My evening was free, so I organized a small group dinner. I extended an invitation in the group chat to anyone who might be interested, specifying that I would be paying for everyone. A friend of a friend of a friend, who we\u2019ll call \u201cNicole\u201d, expressed immediate interest. I\u2019ve never met her in person, but she texts a fair amount and seemed like a lively personality, so I was happy to get to know her a bit better. My very close friend Sachi also joined us, but I was prepared for a bigger group than just the three of us.\n\nThe problem started after we got seated at the restaurant and started to order. I had a sizable budget since I was prepared for more people. So money was not exactly at the front of my mind, I knew how much Sachi and I ate and that we couldn\u2019t possible go over with one extra person. I get myself an appetizer and a main course. Fifty five dollars. Sachi orders herself a main course, and asks to steal some of my appetizer. Fine, another thirty. Then comes Nicole. She picks out the most expensive possible appetizers, main course, and desserts, proceeds to add every single paid modification possible, alongside a couple of drinks. Half way through the order I tell her to relax and that we could get more later, but she insisted that she wanted everything. I then told her that if she kept going I wouldn\u2019t pay for it, but she literally laughed at me and told me I said I\u2019d pay, so she was going to order what she liked. Her personal total came up above a hundred and fifty dollars. \n\nTo me, this was in bad faith and I wasn\u2019t having it. She was taking advantage of the fact that I was treating her, and using it to eat and stock her fridge for a few days with the leftovers. Obviously, when it came time for the bill, Nicole did not take well to the fact that I covered Sachi and not her. She told me that she wasn\u2019t leaving until I paid her bill. I was not willing to compromise because it seemed clear to me that I was being abused. We waited for over an hour as she threw a fit and attempted to guilt me into paying.\n\nEventually her boyfriend texted me looking for her, so I explained the situation. He got pissed and told me to just pay and take her home, but I was adamant, so I gave him the address of the restaurant, made sure he was coming, and left her there. She is now telling everyone that I\u2019m a liar and abandoned her in the middle of nowhere last night.

And you definitely shouldn\u2019t feel bad for sticking up for yourself. Would it have created less \u201cfriction\u201d for you if you had paid for her, sure.

Have some self respect. If you're broke that's okay, just ask for help don't try to scam it.", "The offer was not intended to be empty, I was prepared to pay for her. If there was a single dish on the menu that she really wanted and costed $150 and she seemed a bit guilty about it I would have still paid. My problem with her is that it feels like she was intentionally taking advantage of me, and unapologetically so. My other friend had no problem ordering reasonably and I had enough funds to be lenient, so I don\u2019t feel like my expectations were too confining."]}
