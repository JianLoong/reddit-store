My evening was free, so I organized a small group dinner. I extended an invitation in the group chat to anyone who might be interested, specifying that I would be paying for everyone. A friend of a friend of a friend, who we\u2019ll call \u201cNicole\u201d, expressed immediate interest. I\u2019ve never met her in person, but she texts a fair amount and seemed like a lively personality, so I was happy to get to know her a bit better. My very close friend Sachi also joined us, but I was prepared for a bigger group than just the three of us.\n\nThe problem started after we got seated at the restaurant and started to order. I had a sizable budget since I was prepared for more people. So money was not exactly at the front of my mind, I knew how much Sachi and I ate and that we couldn\u2019t possible go over with one extra person. I get myself an appetizer and a main course. Fifty five dollars. Sachi orders herself a main course, and asks to steal some of my appetizer. Fine, another thirty. Then comes Nicole. She picks out the most expensive possible appetizers, main course, and desserts, proceeds to add every single paid modification possible, alongside a couple of drinks. Half way through the order I tell her to relax and that we could get more later, but she insisted that she wanted everything. I then told her that if she kept going I wouldn\u2019t pay for it, but she literally laughed at me and told me I said I\u2019d pay, so she was going to order what she liked. Her personal total came up above a hundred and fifty dollars. \n\nTo me, this was in bad faith and I wasn\u2019t having it. She was taking advantage of the fact that I was treating her, and using it to eat and stock her fridge for a few days with the leftovers. Obviously, when it came time for the bill, Nicole did not take well to the fact that I covered Sachi and not her. She told me that she wasn\u2019t leaving until I paid her bill. I was not willing to compromise because it seemed clear to me that I was being abused. We waited for over an hour as she threw a fit and attempted to guilt me into paying.\n\nEventually her boyfriend texted me looking for her, so I explained the situation. He got pissed and told me to just pay and take her home, but I was adamant, so I gave him the address of the restaurant, made sure he was coming, and left her there. She is now telling everyone that I\u2019m a liar and abandoned her in the middle of nowhere last night.

This reminds me when I was in high school and my Mom took me and a friend for lunch. My friend ordered the most expensive thing on  the menu - full steak dinner. At lunch! It was $35, when typical mains were more like $15-$20.

The restaurant let  you sit there for an hour?   If I was the waiter - you better tip 40% for taking a table while being children.  You all suck.", "The reason why I opted to include that I would pay the bill up front was because it\u2019s the end of the week and some people may have exhausted their \u201ceating out\u201d budget.

Such lack of awareness is mind boggling at almost any age.", "She was in bad faith, has no manners, and was quite rude all to someone she was meeting in person for the first time. A person nice enough to treat everyone who wanted dinner. This was not okay. You did nothing wrong. You even tried to tell her to mellow out and that she was pushing your goodwill. To rack up a $150 dollar bill was taking advantage of a good guy. You stuck up for yourself. You did good.", "NTA - she broke friend code and also just general manners. If she insists on shit talking to the group I would post this and tell the group that the internet agrees with you, she was taking advantage.", "NTA. She should have ordered similar to what you and your friend ordered or less. Well now you know her true colors. You also warned her not to order more, but she didnt listen", "NTA, though you could have partially paid. Three times more than you ordered is a bit much. Twice as much as the two of you together. That's ridiculous.  You even warned her in advance while she was still ordering. Don't feel bad, she needed the lesson.", "NTA - your title is misleading, she is not your friend. There are several terms for a person like this, ill mannered, low class, greedy etc. We can hope, though, that this taught her not to do this any more to others. It doesn't work.\n\nAnd I have to wonder why her boyfriend called you. Why didn't he call her? One of the posters suggested she was ordering for him. He may have figured something went wrong when she was gone so long and he was trying to talk you in paying the $150 meal. I have never had a $150 meal, or anything close to it, in my life, even when others were paying. \n\nI agree with the others, be sure your friend group knows exactly what she did, you had never seen her before, and you told her you weren't paying if she kept ordering expensive things for the leftovers. If they still think you did the wrong thing, they aren't your friends. NTA", "NTA But set the record straight with others and next time state you will pay up to $50 anything above that the diner has to pay the difference.", "NTA at all. I had a former friend who would never offer to treat any of us (friend group), and whenever we offered to treat everyone, she would order multiple apps, the most expensive entree, multiple cocktails, and dessert (keep in mind this girl would only buy an entree if she was paying for herself- money wasnt the issue, she was just stingy lol- and she would have a few bites of the appetizers everyone else shared but refuse to pitch in for those appetizers bc she \u201cbarely ate any\u201d). it was tacky, and soon we stopped inviting her out to dinner altogether.", "Maybe she changed the name on her post? Just guessing but that\u2019s weird.", "Yes! Before my grandparents passed it was always a competition between my grandpa and my dad for who could pay the bill first. I went up to visit them on my own and it was so nice to be able to pay for dinner and other things for them.", "NTA\n\nShe jumped at the chance to take advantage of a generous friend of a friend and got greedy(around triple your meal? Sheesh!)  If someone offers to treat you that isn\u2019t licence to gorge and splash out more than you would be comfortable with your own money", "When others offer to pay I often order an app. I feel I have been taken advantage & don\u2019t like the feeling. Sometimes I order a meal but I wait to see what they order & order an option cheaper than that. NTA", "NTA\n\nShe was rude and so was anyone who faulted you. I\u2019d never invite her to anything again. She should be embarrassed.", "She was warned! You told her to chill and she said \u201chold my beer\u201d.
