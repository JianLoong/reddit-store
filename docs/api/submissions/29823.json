He dresses for varsity but never plays. I got home at 5 and the game was at 7, 15 minutes away. \n\nMy husband seemed to be in a mood tonight, so I offered to make dinner before we left instead of having him do it; I\u2019ll be honest, though, his foul mood put me in a bit of a foul mood. But I made dinner and we ate together. \n\nIt\u2019s 630 when we finish up, and he starts rushing me to get out the door. It\u2019s cold out, so I needed a little time to bundle up and hadn\u2019t had time before as I was cooking dinner. He was rushing me to the point where I grabbed my boots to put them on in the car, instead of in the house before leaving like a normal freaking person, and we were on our way by 640. \n\nWe had to stop to grab cash on the way, but we still would have made it by 7. I didn\u2019t understand the rush to watch our kid sit on the sidelines in the freezing cold. Even if he, by some stroke of miracle, got to play this game - it wouldn\u2019t be til later in the game. \n\nAnyways, we get the cash and we\u2019re on our way out of the gas station area. My husband hopped in the right lane, but in typical GPS fashion, it can\u2019t make up its mind til you really get on the road. So it switches and says we need to take a left at the light that we\u2019re currently stopped at. The guy in front of us is too close for us to get over, but has room in front of him to scoot up, so my husband starts getting impatient and pissed. The guy finally scoots up for us to BARELY have room to switch lanes, and my husband guns in without looking in the blindspot, side-swiping the person passing us in the left lane.\n\nWe pull into a parking lot, they exchange info and that\u2019s it. My husband gets in like it\u2019s NBD, nonchalant af like oh, there was no damage, it\u2019s wiping right off. She\u2019s not gonna claim anything. Let\u2019s go watch some footy-ball, babe!\n\nBut I\u2019m PISSED! Not only did this happen in MY daily-driver, but it felt like he was taking zero accountability for what just happened. He asks me what\u2019s wrong and I go off. He\u2019s like, it was an accident, it\u2019s not like I did it on purpose, yada yada. But I\u2019m like, if you weren\u2019t in such a rush, when we were literally going to make it on time, this wouldn\u2019t have happened! And I guarantee that she\u2019s going to claim it and our insurance is gonna go up, and this whole living paycheck-to-paycheck has been hard enough without us having higher insurance rates. \n\nWe only ended up staying for half the game bc he was so upset that I was upset.

It\u2019s a fender bender.  It\u2019s an annoyance.  He knows he messed up.  Downplaying the significance of it is a normal response.  \n\nYTA.  You did not need to pile on in that moment.  I am not sure anyone would be ok with their spouse basically yelling the obvious after a mess up.  \n\nCould he have handled it better? Sure.  Could you have handled it better?  Yup.  Don\u2019t escalate these situations.  \n\nAlso regarding your sons games\u2026 he may actually like watching the game.  He may like watching his sons friends and that is probably an important connection between the two.  They may discuss it and talk about the game and how others played.  Just because you only care about how much your son plays and you act accordingly doesn\u2019t mean he feels the same way.  \n\nAlso as a man, it is so frustrating when women get angry at men just because they are angry.  His mood may have nothing to do with you at all but you make it about you when your response isn\u2019t understanding or support or even silence, it\u2019s retaliatory anger.  Treat your husband how you would want to be treated.  The results might surprise you.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe try to not to be late when you agreed on a leaving time?", "YTA for yelling at him. There is more going on in the background that made you explode.", "YTA for being unkind to your partner. Handle your emotions like a grown up.", "Not only that it was damaged on the side she was sitting in.  so she could have gotten hurt as well in the accident.", "I can\u2019t explain his behaviors when we were at home, just nuances that you catch onto as a spouse. And he admitted he was in a mood too!\n\nIn the car, he was getting super irritated. Talking \u201cat\u201d the driver in front of us, being pushy. Which is honestly out of character for him. Further proving that he was in a mood tonight lol\n\nYes there was damage to both vehicles. I didn\u2019t get out to get a close look at the other vehicle, but it definitely looked damaged, although he claimed they were able to rub the marks off and that\u2019s all it would take, and why she didn\u2019t plan to file a claim - only to file a claim less than an hour later. Our vehicle definitely got a good ding on it though.", "I mean that\u2019s good advice, but unfortunately unlike drinking and driving you can\u2019t really choose not to be having a bad day like you can not drink. Driving while angry or upset absolutely is dangerous and people in general need better coping skills to avoid that being a problem, but just don\u2019t drive when you\u2019re pissed off isn\u2019t realistic advice", "I\u2019d agree with you if we hadn\u2019t been so good lately!\n\nBetween my PMS moodiness and the long week we had, the last, literal, 24 hours have been\u2026.less than joyful\u2026.in our house \ud83d\ude43 \n\nAnd we\u2019ll be good again here in the next day or so, but I\u2019m here to see if I was out of bounds tonight or not!", "How to infer that? If they sideswiped someone passing on their left then it would hit the drivers side. She would be in the passengers seat on the right.\n\nIt's reasonable to conclude this is in the US (or at least not the UK/Aus) since varsity football is a very American thing.", "So in that case I would say ESH. He's an ashsole for being reckless and letting his impatience and anger cause him to crash. Also for not understanding why you would be upset. \n\nI think you're a bit of an asshole because you don't take it seriously that you should be there for your kid's game. Even if he's not playing for the entire game, he's going to be excited to see you showed up and are there watching, and it will make him feel that you care. It's important to show up on time and stay for the whole thing. \n\nIt also doesn't seem like you really gave yourself enough time to be ready to go on time. Your husband was in a rush because you were causing him (and you) to be late. You said it takes 15 minutes to get there and you also needed to stop to grab cash on the way, and the game actually started at 7. You probably really needed to leave earlier than 6:40 to stop for cash, park, find seats, and be in your seats by 7. 6:40 was cutting it really close and you weren't even ready by then.", "I have to admit that you would\u2019ve irritated me with your nonchalant attitude (before leaving the house). You got home at 5 and didn\u2019t finish up dinner until 6:30 (for only 2 adults)? Then you take more time to \u201cbundle up?\u201d Why didn\u2019t you both make yourself a couple of sandwiches and eat a couple of pieces of fruit? Bundle up? Grab a sweater and your coat. You had just come home from work so you knew the temperature outside. The \u201cbundling up\u201d shouldn\u2019t have been last minute or a big endeavor. Believe me, I\u2019ve sat through MANY games in the cold and was rushed to get out the door. I learned to keep blankets in the car (just in case we needed them), extra hats and gloves, etc. \n\nI\u2019m guessing that your husband wanted to be in the stands before your son\u2019s team came onto the field so your son could catch a glimpse of the both of you. \n\nIt takes time to park and get into the stadium. So if you were leaving your home at 6:40, game starts at 7, stadium is 15 minutes away\u2026..yeah, I wouldn\u2019t be happy if I were your husband. That time frame doesn\u2019t even take into account possible traffic issues. \n\nRegarding time management, my ex was you, and I was your husband. That\u2019s why we started taking separate cars. If my ex wasn\u2019t ready, I left without him and then would text to tell him where I was seated in the stadium. \n\nRegarding your husband\u2019s poor driving, that\u2019s a separate issue, and I\u2019d be pissed.", "I don't know why you're getting down voted for your appraisal. I'm guessing from the way OP describes this, kid was playing American football, which I don't know much about (I'm Australian), but I think any kid wants to see their parents at the game regardless of whether they get onto the field or not, and they would probably be too involved watching the game once it starts to see parents arrive even if only a few minutes late. Was it necessary to stop for cash beforehand? Whose decision was that? Without clarification on that, I'd agree with ESH.", "I got home at 5 and needed to shower. My husband didn\u2019t start dinner until around 545, which is right around the time I was coming down from getting ready and took over for him. By the time it was done and we finished eating, yes it was 630. \n\nYes, I needed time to bundle up. I put on a whole other outfit overtop of the one I was wearing, and no I couldn\u2019t have done that earlier without sweating for an entire hour. I also had to pee before throwing all those clothes on. We do have blankets, gloves and hats already in the car for these exact circumstances. \n\nAnd to wrap it all up, our kid doesn\u2019t even see us in the stands 99% of the time because they\u2019re so packed. So that point is moot as to why he would NEED to be there so early. Our kid would have never known we were 5 minutes late. And we ended up being even more than that because of the accident, so how silly is this whole argument anyways? \n\nShould I have let my husband finish cooking while I finished getting ready? Maybe. But I\u2019m always more than on time, so you would think he would\u2019ve understood, \u201chey, maybe she\u2019s running a little late because she made dinner for me after I had a bad day.\u201d", "Football here is huge, our kid doesn\u2019t even know whether we\u2019re there or not because the stands are so packed. He\u2019s certainly not going to know if we\u2019re a few minutes late. \n\nWe needed cash to pay to get in the game. It was no one\u2019s outright decision.", "So you didn't factor the time it takes to get cash into your driving time? I'm not sure I understand why this wasn't already sorted if you were home at 5. And I reckon your kid would notice you not being there, even in a crowded venue. Seems odd to me that you wouldn't want to wish him luck or something beforehand."]}
