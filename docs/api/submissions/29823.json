It\u2019s a fender bender.  It\u2019s an annoyance.  He knows he messed up.  Downplaying the significance of it is a normal response.  \n\nYTA.  You did not need to pile on in that moment.  I am not sure anyone would be ok with their spouse basically yelling the obvious after a mess up.  \n\nCould he have handled it better? Sure.  Could you have handled it better?  Yup.  Don\u2019t escalate these situations.  \n\nAlso regarding your sons games\u2026 he may actually like watching the game.  He may like watching his sons friends and that is probably an important connection between the two.  They may discuss it and talk about the game and how others played.  Just because you only care about how much your son plays and you act accordingly doesn\u2019t mean he feels the same way.  \n\nAlso as a man, it is so frustrating when women get angry at men just because they are angry.  His mood may have nothing to do with you at all but you make it about you when your response isn\u2019t understanding or support or even silence, it\u2019s retaliatory anger.  Treat your husband how you would want to be treated.  The results might surprise you.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe try to not to be late when you agreed on a leaving time?", "YTA for yelling at him. There is more going on in the background that made you explode.", "YTA for being unkind to your partner. Handle your emotions like a grown up.", "Not only that it was damaged on the side she was sitting in.  so she could have gotten hurt as well in the accident.", "I can\u2019t explain his behaviors when we were at home, just nuances that you catch onto as a spouse. And he admitted he was in a mood too!\n\nIn the car, he was getting super irritated. Talking \u201cat\u201d the driver in front of us, being pushy. Which is honestly out of character for him. Further proving that he was in a mood tonight lol\n\nYes there was damage to both vehicles. I didn\u2019t get out to get a close look at the other vehicle, but it definitely looked damaged, although he claimed they were able to rub the marks off and that\u2019s all it would take, and why she didn\u2019t plan to file a claim - only to file a claim less than an hour later. Our vehicle definitely got a good ding on it though.", "I mean that\u2019s good advice, but unfortunately unlike drinking and driving you can\u2019t really choose not to be having a bad day like you can not drink. Driving while angry or upset absolutely is dangerous and people in general need better coping skills to avoid that being a problem, but just don\u2019t drive when you\u2019re pissed off isn\u2019t realistic advice", "I\u2019d agree with you if we hadn\u2019t been so good lately!\n\nBetween my PMS moodiness and the long week we had, the last, literal, 24 hours have been\u2026.less than joyful\u2026.in our house \ud83d\ude43 \n\nAnd we\u2019ll be good again here in the next day or so, but I\u2019m here to see if I was out of bounds tonight or not!", "How to infer that? If they sideswiped someone passing on their left then it would hit the drivers side. She would be in the passengers seat on the right.\n\nIt's reasonable to conclude this is in the US (or at least not the UK/Aus) since varsity football is a very American thing.", "So in that case I would say ESH. He's an ashsole for being reckless and letting his impatience and anger cause him to crash. Also for not understanding why you would be upset. \n\nI think you're a bit of an asshole because you don't take it seriously that you should be there for your kid's game. Even if he's not playing for the entire game, he's going to be excited to see you showed up and are there watching, and it will make him feel that you care. It's important to show up on time and stay for the whole thing. \n\nIt also doesn't seem like you really gave yourself enough time to be ready to go on time. Your husband was in a rush because you were causing him (and you) to be late. You said it takes 15 minutes to get there and you also needed to stop to grab cash on the way, and the game actually started at 7. You probably really needed to leave earlier than 6:40 to stop for cash, park, find seats, and be in your seats by 7. 6:40 was cutting it really close and you weren't even ready by then.", "I have to admit that you would\u2019ve irritated me with your nonchalant attitude (before leaving the house). You got home at 5 and didn\u2019t finish up dinner until 6:30 (for only 2 adults)? Then you take more time to \u201cbundle up?\u201d Why didn\u2019t you both make yourself a couple of sandwiches and eat a couple of pieces of fruit? Bundle up? Grab a sweater and your coat. You had just come home from work so you knew the temperature outside. The \u201cbundling up\u201d shouldn\u2019t have been last minute or a big endeavor. Believe me, I\u2019ve sat through MANY games in the cold and was rushed to get out the door. I learned to keep blankets in the car (just in case we needed them), extra hats and gloves, etc. \n\nI\u2019m guessing that your husband wanted to be in the stands before your son\u2019s team came onto the field so your son could catch a glimpse of the both of you. \n\nIt takes time to park and get into the stadium. So if you were leaving your home at 6:40, game starts at 7, stadium is 15 minutes away\u2026..yeah, I wouldn\u2019t be happy if I were your husband. That time frame doesn\u2019t even take into account possible traffic issues. \n\nRegarding time management, my ex was you, and I was your husband. That\u2019s why we started taking separate cars. If my ex wasn\u2019t ready, I left without him and then would text to tell him where I was seated in the stadium. \n\nRegarding your husband\u2019s poor driving, that\u2019s a separate issue, and I\u2019d be pissed.", "I don't know why you're getting down voted for your appraisal. I'm guessing from the way OP describes this, kid was playing American football, which I don't know much about (I'm Australian), but I think any kid wants to see their parents at the game regardless of whether they get onto the field or not, and they would probably be too involved watching the game once it starts to see parents arrive even if only a few minutes late. Was it necessary to stop for cash beforehand? Whose decision was that? Without clarification on that, I'd agree with ESH.", "I got home at 5 and needed to shower. My husband didn\u2019t start dinner until around 545, which is right around the time I was coming down from getting ready and took over for him. By the time it was done and we finished eating, yes it was 630. \n\nYes, I needed time to bundle up. I put on a whole other outfit overtop of the one I was wearing, and no I couldn\u2019t have done that earlier without sweating for an entire hour. I also had to pee before throwing all those clothes on. We do have blankets, gloves and hats already in the car for these exact circumstances. \n\nAnd to wrap it all up, our kid doesn\u2019t even see us in the stands 99% of the time because they\u2019re so packed. So that point is moot as to why he would NEED to be there so early. Our kid would have never known we were 5 minutes late. And we ended up being even more than that because of the accident, so how silly is this whole argument anyways? \n\nShould I have let my husband finish cooking while I finished getting ready? Maybe. But I\u2019m always more than on time, so you would think he would\u2019ve understood, \u201chey, maybe she\u2019s running a little late because she made dinner for me after I had a bad day.\u201d", "Football here is huge, our kid doesn\u2019t even know whether we\u2019re there or not because the stands are so packed. He\u2019s certainly not going to know if we\u2019re a few minutes late. \n\nWe needed cash to pay to get in the game. It was no one\u2019s outright decision.", "So you didn't factor the time it takes to get cash into your driving time? I'm not sure I understand why this wasn't already sorted if you were home at 5. And I reckon your kid would notice you not being there, even in a crowded venue. Seems odd to me that you wouldn't want to wish him luck or something beforehand.", "NTA. People who wait until it's too late to try and change lanes are the worst. If you were stopped in a right turn lane and realized you needed to turn left, the safest thing to do would have been to just take the right turn, then turn around at the first opportunity (using a side street, driveway, or U Turn if nobody's around) and go back through the intersection and you'd be headed in the right direction with only about a minute of time lost.", "NTA\nIt doesn't matter if he was in a rush he crashed into someone oh it was a accident doesn't really change that fact you are reasonably pissed off and his attitude shows no willingness to take responsibility for his actions.", "ESH- you for your attitude about your son\u2019s game. Newflash- he works just as hard as everyone else practicing hours a day to wear that jersey.

You weren't to the game yet, what else do you do in the 10 minutes after an accident? \n\nYou sound like you were having a bad day and an extra frustrating thing happened while you were going to go do something you didn't want to do in the first place. Almost all of that is not your husband's fault or responsibility. \n\nNTA for being frustrated. YTA for \"going off on\" your husband.", "YTA\n\nHonestly, I think you caused the accident by stressing him out so much about missing the game that it ruined any level headdress he had. I was getting so stressed out reading how sloooow you were with everything. I hate sports of any kind and even I would have been really angry with you. Heck, I would have left you behind. \n\nYou took your sweet time for everything. You were even done with dinner until 6:30. I would have been there already. Then you took while to get ready, then took time to stop by the bank, etc. Most people like to arrive early to places. Getting somewhere right on the dot is stressful and leaving so late leaves zero wiggle room for anything that may happen...such a a possible car wreck or bad traffic. \n\nHonestly OP, I think it is on you to pay for damages here. I know I'm in the minority here with this judgement, but this gave me such anxiety to read.", "YTA\n\nWhat stuck out to me is how you seem not to care about being on time for your sons games since he doesn\u2019t get much playing time. When I was in his position, it make me feel warm and fuzzy to look up and see my parents in the stands, even if I wasn\u2019t getting much field time. It\u2019s just a matter of being there to support him. \n\nAlso, nothing is more frustrating as a man than when a woman makes you late for an event. 9/10 times being late is inexcusable and is only caused by poor planning. I guarantee this is not the first time you\u2019ve made him late and \u201cgetting bundled up\u201d sounds like a ridiculous reason.", "You\u2019re both TA.

We\u2019re smart enough to know yes, even when he says idc", "I don\u2019t care one way or another how much playing time he gets! There is zero disappointment coming from me in that regard. But I\u2019m not gonna rush like a crazy madwoman to get to a game where he\u2019s sitting on the sidelines. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not gonna get there, or get there half an hour late. But I think I can give myself a little grace to be 5-10 minutes late to ONE game. And I don\u2019t think that makes me a bad mom, either.", "I'm still caught up in the part about listening to the GPS telling him what lane to be in. This is the area where you live and he needs a GPS to figure out how to get from home to your son's school? Some place you've been to a number of times before?", "Maybe making a sandwich as opposed to cooking on these type of evenings would be a good choice. Or heating up leftovers. Or scooping something out of the crockpot. Way less stress and time for the both of you. \n\nPersonally, if I got home at 5 on game night that\u2019s at 7 (and knew I needed to shower and wouldn\u2019t be ready until 5:45), there\u2019s no way I\u2019d be cool with my spouse starting dinner at that time. But I\u2019m over the top about being on time. I was raised that if you\u2019re not 10 minutes early, you\u2019re late. So your approach (and your husband\u2019s) to this situation would\u2019ve stressed me out beyond belief. That\u2019s just me, and I acknowledge it\u2019s one of my issues. \n\nFor me, to make things less stressful, my now ex and I drove separately (after many years of this kind of stress for me). Dinner was something from the crockpot on those nights or leftovers that were easily and quickly heated up. \n\nAnd I fully understand your statement that your kid doesn\u2019t see you in the stands 99% of the time. But it\u2019s that 1%. My kids are now adults and I\u2019m many years past where you are. What puts a smile on my old face now is the memory of one of my kids commenting (offhandedly) that he or she saw or heard (my cheering voice carries) me. \n\nI also understand getting to the stadium/field in the cold and/or rain, your kid sits on the sidelines the entire freaking game, and your kid later comments \u201cOh, you were there?\u201d Been there, done that too many times to count. \n\nHaving said all of that, your husband\u2019s nonchalant attitude to his fender bender (100% avoidable) would piss me off beyond belief. You know that your insurance rates are going to go up, and he probably has points on his license now (will also raise your insurance rates). \n\nYou\u2019re both the A H and N T A, if that makes any sense. \n\n\nI feel for the both of you.", "So you say that you offered to make dinner because he was in a mood, but now instead you went to shower for 45 minutes while he made dinner? \n\nAlso I don't understand how it takes 10 minutes to dress for going outside, and not even putting boots on! We reach close to -20\u00b0C where I live and I can't even start to imagine what takes so long to put on if you are an adult. Even dressing my 7yo doesn't take so long!", ">My husband didn\u2019t start dinner until around 545\n\nBut you said in your original post that you made dinner?", "What kind of work do you do that you have to shower before going to your son's game?", "I don\u2019t necessarily disagree with you that dinner should\u2019ve already been ready to go. That\u2019s why I suggested sandwiches, leftovers, or crockpot dinners. \n\nDinner seemed like an unnecessary production when they were in a time crunch. She seemed to take time getting ready (before and after dinner). Granted, I\u2019m one of those who can get ready in less than 20 minutes tops (shower and makeup included) so I don\u2019t understand taking close to an hour in order to go to a kid\u2019s game. That\u2019s me. \n\nSeparate cars would\u2019ve solved all of this. Stress removed for both of them. \n\nAnd I agree with you that I would never let him drive my car again and would make him pay for the premium increases.", "It wasn\u2019t one single sentence, you mention over and over how it isn\u2019t REALLY your sons football game and it doesn\u2019t matter\n\nYour husband was in a mood because he felt like your son will be hurt by how you treat his stuff\n\nLike literally whatever you say goes out the window if you can\u2019t even remember that one sentence isn\u2019t a paragraph and a half", "I\u2019m changing to YTA.

The idea that he\u2019s not going to see us, whether we\u2019re there on time or not, is what gave my mind a little flexibility when we were running behind yesterday. Which, again, is not a common occurrence in our household. Just one of those weeks, ya know?\n\nYour insight is definitely appreciated though! We\u2019ll for sure be adding easy meals to our shopping list this week. I\u2019m tired of us acting like superhumans who can cook every freaking night \u2620\ufe0f", "Military and hadn\u2019t washed my hair all week. And I would\u2019ve had more than enough time to shower and be ready in time to leave if I hadn\u2019t taken over dinner for my husband and he cooked like we had planned. But when I came down and saw he was upset, I wanted to take that burden off of him and give him a little time to relax. Ended up creating a whole different burden, but I thought I\u2019d have time cook and finish getting ready.", "If her husband so so concerned about being on ti.e, why did he wait to start dinner (that he didn't even finish because of his mood) until OP had been home for 45 minutes! \n\nThat was his part of keeping them on time. Making dinner which he did late and then pawned the task off to OP.", "I don\u2019t think y\u2019all are understanding just how big these games are. We don\u2019t even get to see him prior to the game; we literally have to wish him luck in the morning before school and that\u2019s the last we see of him til he\u2019s on the field to play. We ask him everytime if he saw us and I think he\u2019s seen us once??? And at the end of the day, it\u2019s not like we weren\u2019t showing up at all like\u2026.everyone\u2019s acting like they\u2019ve never been 5 minutes late to something lol\n\nWe always get our cash on the way to the games. We cut it close this time, time-wise, yeah. But in a perfect world, we only would\u2019ve left about 10 minutes earlier.", "Remind your husband that GPS will recalculate your route if you miss a turn, and how late would you be if that was a semitruck in the next lane and not another car? \n\nPoint out you're sure your son would prefer you both make it a few minutes late if the other choice is visiting you in the hospital.", "What gets me is that if he was supposed to be the one cooking and he was in a foul mood but you took over why couldn't he had start prepping to get ready to go to the son's game beforehand.\n\n\nYou said you had to put on another outfit over it could he have got it laid out for you? On his way home why couldn't he have stopped and got money.\n\nWhy did you all take your car and him drive? Couldn't you have taken his car instead that way the accident would have been in his car\n\n\nYou said you worked military was there a reason why you had to wash your hair before the game instead of after the game?", "Why would you wait til the night of your son's game to want to shower and wash your hair?\n\nAnd going to the game with wet hair?\n\nOr did you take the time to dry it?\n\nI would have just put a hat on my head to, yah know, bundle up and keep my head warm and not let anyone see my dirty hair.\n\nI would have showered after.", "But you didn't leave 10 minutes earlier, and you've asked for a judgement on the situation. In a perfect world, you wouldn't need to ask, and it seems you're only on here to have judgement go your way because you're refusing to accept the judgements that go against you. Your husband obviously wanted to get there earlier and was stressed that you weren't going to. You already said he was \"in a mood\" and yet you did nothing to help ease that tension, such as ensuring you left at the agreed time, and then proceeded to yell at him for being stressed in that situation. Yes, he was in the wrong for causing the accident, but you're not free from blame, so I stand by my judgement of ESH.", "My car gets better gas mileage; it\u2019s what we always take when we\u2019re not going separate places. I grew up the same way - mom and dad have separate cars but when we go places all together, we take mom\u2019s and dad drives.

And let it air dry since I volunteered to take over dinner. When it was originally the ONLY thing on my agenda prior to the game, I really didn\u2019t think it was insane or irresponsible of me to do that. Do you? How long does it take you to shower and wash your hair?", "I\u2019m struggling to accept the judgments against me bc the judgments against me are claiming idc about my son\u2019s game (I do care), I\u2019m the reason my husband was in a bad mood to begin with (I wasn\u2019t), and isn\u2019t even addressing the original question about if I\u2019m an AH for being pissed that my husband got in an accident. \n\nI\u2019ll take all the E S H votes, and I accept that I didn\u2019t manage my time as well as I usually do. But the majority of the E S H and Y T A votes focusing purely on this idea that I\u2019m a shitty parent for being late to one football game is where I get a little defensive.
