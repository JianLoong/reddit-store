She married someone who calls her culture \"primitive nonsense\" and doesn't let her child socialise with the family. Why would she get welcomed when she won't respect others?", "NTA - Yes, it stinks that your sister is alienated from the family and the culture. It sounds like her husband is not very willing to understand her (and your) culture and why you perform certain ceremonies. Although, she is understanding, and abiding to his, causing her to feel unsupported by the family. \n\nIn cross cultural marriages, the ones that work, both parties are open to the other's culture. This does not seem very constructive for K and BIL's marriage and may eventually result in divorce, if HE does not open his mind or become willing to learn about his wife's family and culture.\n\nPS. Do not blame your sister, this sounds like emotional abuse. Blaming her is victim blaming. She loves him and her family and he is unwilling to budge. \n\nNTA, neither is sister, BIL is the a-hole!", "NTA\n\nshe alienated herself and her husband rejected your culture, that isn\u2019t your fault. sometimes people just need to be told shit how it is even if it is harsh.", "NTA. If they refused to have the welcoming ceremony for her child, she can hardly cry about not getting gifts like you did at yours. She's alienating herself. \n\nObviously she's feeling torn between cultures and her husband who seems to think your culture is \"primitive\" is making the situation a lot worse. She needs to figure out how she wants to live and raise her child and not blame her family for benefits/support she has rejected.", "NTA. Idk what she expected...", "NTA\n\nYou know she\u2019s just upset cause you seem to have a better life than her. Say what you want but from where I am from, people think they\u2019re so high up once they study abroad and maybe feels that way?  She\u2019s the one with the education from the US, but why is it that you have more great things than her? \n\nInstead of teaching her husband her culture, she supports his racism. \n\nThere\u2019s a chance she\u2019s a narcissist.", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Has it occurred to you that this is NOT your sister's fault?    \n\n\nThis is a classic case of spousal abuse.

Your sister married a racist who alienated her from her family, and she's now blaming the family for it? What were you supposed to do, when she wouldn't visit you or invite you over because BIL thinks you're savages?

That doesn't mean she can insult you freely, you have a right to stand up for yourself, and it doesn't sound like you were unnecessarily cruel. She needs support to get out of her situation when she decides to leave it. Her husband shits all over your shared culture and calls it primitive, that's extremely classiest and bigoted, and possibly racist as well (race wasn't specifically mentioned but I'm making an educated guess that there's a difference between her husband and your family.)", "NTA her and her husband have alienated themselves, also like tons of cultures have pig slaughter ceremonies for various things, it's hardly a rarity. That said I doubt an American would necessarily know that, but you'd think they'd do some research into their partners culture at some point.", "NAH , except the stupid bil.\n\nI think your sister is being isolated from her family and she is sad and angry.  Bil sounds controlling.   I worry that she is facing abuse at home. \n\nOf course it\u2019s not your fault for snapping back at her.  But rejecting her isn\u2019t going to help.

It's sad that your sister married someone outside your culture that refuses to acknowledge, understand or appreciate your cultural traditions.  I'm sure many of his cultural traditions seem very odd to your family as well, but they have the tact and kindness not to call them \"primitive\" or \"barbaric.\" \n\nI hope your sister gets over her jealousy and sees this for what it truly is: a situation of her own making since she chose to marry someone who is prejudiced against her culture - and as such - against her.
