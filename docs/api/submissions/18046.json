Although, she is understanding, and abiding to his, causing her to feel unsupported by the family. \n\nIn cross cultural marriages, the ones that work, both parties are open to the other's culture.

Pigs or not.", "Not to mention in the BORU post the OP was in an entirely different country on a whole other continent.", "Nta it does seem like your family wants to include your sister and her husband but they are not interested in being included. You could try talking to her later and more gently ask her how she should be included when the previous attempts have been rebuffed.", "NAH.  \nI think there are a lot of complex feelings at play here. The husband probably didn't move willingly but out of necessity and the new local culture is very different from what he's used to and he struggles a lot to adapt. He lost his business and he's probably grieving for that and this probably makes him reject his new life and country. He must be going through a really hard time.  \nYour sister is aware of that and empathizes with him but she also must feels caught in the middle and her feelings came out that way. You and your family aren't assholes and it doesn't sound like you did anything wrong.  \n They are just going through a very difficult time and taking care of a baby on top of it. I wish your brother in law could go to therapy because I think he really needs it. He's also not doing himself any favors by isolating himself, he needs all the support he can get.", "Her husband absolutely refused welcome ceremony, you went ahead with it, called culture primitive nonsense. Damned if you do, Damned if you don't, your sister is resenting herself more than her husband because she got to see first hand what she missed out on and is now mad at everybody bcz she is unable to accept she's mad at herself and her husband.", "NTA.\n\nHe is obviously ethnicentric and hateful about your culture - \"primitive nonsense.\"  \n\nI am questioning  as to how abusive he is to her.  She is isolated from people and her culture.  Could she be brainwashed or manipulated by him.\n\nOverall, she did cause her own mess.  You were correct in that.", "NTA\u2026 poor woman.. her husband sounds awful", "You are 26 not 16, ten years is not a big deal", "Hunting is actually really important for the deer population, and probably other populations.\n\nIf deer aren't hunted, they go into overshoot.", "Yeah, in areas where we wiped out the natural predators we need to cull the populations of some species and hunting is one way of doing that.", "Oh, I had assumed both were from different parts of India."]}
