She married someone who calls her culture \"primitive nonsense\" and doesn't let her child socialise with the family. Why would she get welcomed when she won't respect others?", "NTA - Yes, it stinks that your sister is alienated from the family and the culture. It sounds like her husband is not very willing to understand her (and your) culture and why you perform certain ceremonies. Although, she is understanding, and abiding to his, causing her to feel unsupported by the family. \n\nIn cross cultural marriages, the ones that work, both parties are open to the other's culture. This does not seem very constructive for K and BIL's marriage and may eventually result in divorce, if HE does not open his mind or become willing to learn about his wife's family and culture.\n\nPS. Do not blame your sister, this sounds like emotional abuse. Blaming her is victim blaming. She loves him and her family and he is unwilling to budge. \n\nNTA, neither is sister, BIL is the a-hole!", "NTA\n\nshe alienated herself and her husband rejected your culture, that isn\u2019t your fault. sometimes people just need to be told shit how it is even if it is harsh.", "NTA. If they refused to have the welcoming ceremony for her child, she can hardly cry about not getting gifts like you did at yours. She's alienating herself. \n\nObviously she's feeling torn between cultures and her husband who seems to think your culture is \"primitive\" is making the situation a lot worse. She needs to figure out how she wants to live and raise her child and not blame her family for benefits/support she has rejected.", "NTA. Idk what she expected...", "NTA\n\nYou know she\u2019s just upset cause you seem to have a better life than her. Say what you want but from where I am from, people think they\u2019re so high up once they study abroad and maybe feels that way?  She\u2019s the one with the education from the US, but why is it that you have more great things than her? \n\nInstead of teaching her husband her culture, she supports his racism. \n\nThere\u2019s a chance she\u2019s a narcissist.", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
