Our only criteria is \u201chas a pulse, 60 college credits in anything, and can pass a finger print background check.\u201d We are still seeing soooo many days where there are more teachers out than subs to fill spots so colleagues and admin are scrambling to cover classes on our prep time.

Either way, your wife seems to really struggle to say no to her mum even when her requests are unreasonable. As a doormat people pleaser who has spent years learning from my assertive husband how to say no to people properly, and really advocate for myself without feeling guilty for it, growing a spine can be difficult and uncomfortable. She might stumble occasionally (like mentioning a trip she knows she's meant to keep a secret on the phone, for example) but I wish her every success. I started small - learning to take the last biscuit, even when it was offered to me, was actually a little tricky. Weirdly, learning to play video games was very helpful. I think it's because learning that I actually could do something I thought was scary and too difficult for me ended up boosting my confidence a lot. (Plus, you *cannot* play God of War (2018), or it's sequel for that matter, without learning that 'no' is a complete sentence.) I realised after a while that my inability to stand up for my self was linked to some fairly crushing low self esteem. Be easy to support your wife and build her confidence if that's the case for her too because when I finally acknowledged how much I kind of loathed myself, it was not pretty and I needed support. \n\nThings that might help your wife are looking up 'grey rocking' and limiting all communication with her mum to texts and emails (that way her mum cannot interrupt her, she can think about what she says, take time to think about whether she wants to say 'no' before she replies, get your help to craft a polite but firm reply and get your assurance that she's being assertive not rude etc). A therapist might also be able to help unwind her feelings about her mum and herself with her, and give her some practical tools to handle her in conversation. It sounds like your mother in laws criticisms of your wife boarders into persistent verbal abuse. A call from a parent should not leave you feeling like shit. A call with your abuser is likely to. It may take some time and thinking for her to recognise that. She would be completely justified in cutting her mother off completely, and extremely unwise to stay in the situation she's currently in. Anyway, apologies if I've misjudged the situation or protected wildly, but I hope some of this is helpful.", "That and there's plenty of kids nowadays who would give her a run for her money.

I told you, I need you to do that thing we talked about!\" Daughter whined \"but MOOM\" then told the friend on the other end of the phone \"sorry, my mom is just impossible today\", hung up and then thanked me.
