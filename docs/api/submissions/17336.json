Your MIL knew damn well she was calling on Mother's day to ask to go on the trip.  Sometimes spouses have to be the bad guy and this was one of those times and that you stepped up for your wife to correctly take.  Do not give in and you are absolutely correct that it would be stressful.", "NTA\n\nNeither you or your wife have any obligation whatsoever to her parents. Why does she continue to contact her mother when her mother makes her feel awful?", "NTA but your wife is for putting you on the spot. That should have been a conversation after the phone call.", "NTA, i would never go on vacation with my mil but that is for a number of reasons.", "Nta at all keep those boundaries mothers day does not mean invite your mil on vacations planned for you and your wife.  Your mother in law having a boring retirement doesnt obligate you to provide her with activities or trips either. She is toxic to your wife and will ruin the trip", "NTA. We went to a family wedding, and everyone booked at the same hotel. We booked a Air B&B down the street. Make your boundaries known. If/when you decide to have children she will cause them to have that same anxiety. My 8 and 12 yr old nephew asked that MIL not come to Easter this year.", "NTA your MIL sounds like a treat.  If she wants to go to Hawaii then she can take herself there.  Also your poor wife.", "NTA. That's what toxic people do when you set boundaries with them. The only way you'll ever have any kind of peace with your MIL is if you give in every single time to her every whim. Stand your ground, firmly and kindly.", "NTA it's your vacation, people tend to want to relax on vacation, and it sounds like your mil will put your wife to work, therefore putting you to work.", "As someone that has had to deal with difficult parents in relationships, NTA. It\u2019s clear that MIL is, at best, not considerate of your wife\u2019s desires. Not only did she push to make the request, it had to be down \u2018now\u2019.\n\nI think it is definitely fuel for a potentially uncomfy conversation between your wife and her seemingly difficult mother, though. So try to be sympathetic to the fact that YOU don\u2019t have to carry the load of the blowback.", "Can I go to Hawaii with you? No?\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your wife needs to learn to say no to her mother.", "NTA. Mothers Day doesn\u2019t entitle the MIL to a free trip a few months later.", "Lol, NTA. Inviting herself to someone else's vacation was entitled. What did she expect you to do? Change all your plans to accommodate her?\n\nYou could've been kinder or quieter about saying \"no\" while they were on the call, though.", "NTA..and your wife is a bit of an AH for asking that question while on the phone with her mom..\n\nIn which world would anyone want to go to Hawai\u2019i with in laws, if she\u2019s retired it\u2019s good to go out with her friends - that\u2019ll be more fun for her", "NTA - if your MIL were a drunk at a bar and trying to punch your wife, would you step in?   Would you feel guilty about it afterward?   You should feel no more guilty about protecting her in this situation.\n\nStill you can do a better job of it with more finesse.   Simply firmly say \"I want our vacation to just be us\" and not project that your MIL would make the vacation stressful even though true.    Part of protecting your wife is also to protect her from fallout from being overly blunt.", "NTA, but I think it is beyond time for your wife to put her mother on an information diet. Planning a tropical holiday? She can find out about it after it happened because it was a \"spur of the moment\" trip. Just because you spent 6 months planning this tropical holiday, doesn't mean she needs to know about it. Should also look into the Grey Rock Method with your wife and hopefully that helps make interacting with her mother easier.", "NTA for drawing a firm line, but YTA for not managing the situation better and putting your wife directly in the line of fire...and then pouring gas on the fire with your stressful comment. \n\nIt doesn't need to be said, but your MIL is also an AH in this.", "Info: can your MIL pay for the trip or would you have to cover it? \n\nNTA: even if you liked (or loved) your MiL, having her on the trip will change it from a romantic trip to a family trip. Explain that to your wife that it won\u2019t be a romantic trip with a family member there. And that she and her mom should plan a girls trip together later this year.", "NTA for saying no, but you could have been a bit more diplomatic in your response so to not add drama. A better response could have been \u201cI think that\u2019s a conversation we should have in private\u201d then come up with a way to say no that doesn\u2019t hurt you MIL\u2019s feelings.", "ESH. \n\nYour MIL for obvious reasons\n\nYou're wife for not having a backbone, not being able to say no to her mom herself, for not even waiting until she was off the phone to ask you, and for not notifying you that her mom was still on the phone. Honestly, what was she expecting to happen here?\n\nAnd you for being that harsh about your MIL. Even if she wasn't on the phone, it's still your wife's mom and you know she's trying to have a relationship with her. If she seriously was going to ask you about taking her mom, a little tact would be nice. Essentially, you were being a bit of a dick even if you were 100% correct in saying it would be stressful. Being honest doesn't mean you're not being am AH.", "YTA. It should be a mutual conversation between you and your wife prior to making the decision. A simple \u201cwe will talk about it later\u201d would\u2019ve sufficed.

She can volunteer., learn a new hobby , join a book club or card group", "NTA, a married couple with no kids going to Hawaii is called a romantic trip to paradise.  You are a great husband for being the fall guy.", "NTA. I'm going to be harsh here. You described your wife as a people pleaser and you realized on here that it's most likely that your MiL planned this whole thing to manipulate your wife into agreeing to let her come on the trip. \n\nYour wife needs to grow a spine. She needs therapy to learn how to set boundaries and enforce them. You can't constantly be the bad guy who does it, especially since she's mad at you for looking out for her best interest when she won't do it herself. \n\nIf she wouldn't tolerate this behavior from someone else then she shouldn't tolerate it from her mom \"because family\". It's a dumb reason to let people treat you like garbage. Family are the people that love and support you and lift you up, not someone who manipulates and tears you down.\n\nSpeaking from personal experience, you learn to be a people pleaser because you're trying to manage someone else's emotions. When you grow up with someone that throws a tantrum or worse when they don't get their way, it becomes easier to just do what they want so you can avoid the blow up. It becomes a habit you practice with everyone, not just the one volatile person. In the end though you're just making yourself miserable because other people learn real quick that you won't stand up for yourself and will do whatever they want, so they keep pushing and taking more from you. \n\nShe desperately needs to learn how to say no and enforce it. She can't let you do it for her because her mom will just go around you.

And does she not understand that the MIL will destroy any fun you two might have?\n\nIf she refuses to keep it a secret then tell her that she doesn't ever need to ask you.

But Mum won't ever stop talking to him or tell him off because FAMILY. \n\nAnd NTA, by the way. If this makes your MIL go no contact with you, I really wouldn't worry. She brought this on herself.", "All this is my subjective interpretation: Your MIL is a narcissist and your wife, her daughter, has been groomed to be a people pleaser. A narcissist needs stimulation and adoration. They can never be wrong or disrespected. Your wife sadly had to learn the hard way to survive, which is kowtowing to such a person as a parent when you're a helpless child. That eventually becomes engrained. Your MIL absolutely planned to raise this 'request' on MD for maximum leverage.\n\nYour wife would really benefit from reducing contact, perhaps seeing a therapist and critically assessing her childhood and her mother's behaviour in hindsight. It'll be painful, but she will learn a lot and save herself more pain in the long run.\n\nHowever, even if you set aside all of that, please don't stop being such a firm, good support and empowering person to her. Anyone with a narcissist parent needs that.\n\nYou're NTA and it's normal and natural your wife loves and cares for her mum... but her mother will never return those feelings as she is incapable of it.\n\nExpect more difficult situations like this and continued, endless gripes from your MIL throughout your future. Take care and don't be made to second guess yourself!

Nope. NTA before this anyway, but that isn\u2019t even reasonable.", "And some times we wish we kept the receipt for return/exchange on the ones we have.", "Right?
