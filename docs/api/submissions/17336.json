Your mother in law having a boring retirement doesnt obligate you to provide her with activities or trips either. She is toxic to your wife and will ruin the trip", "NTA. We went to a family wedding, and everyone booked at the same hotel. We booked a Air B&B down the street. Make your boundaries known. If/when you decide to have children she will cause them to have that same anxiety. My 8 and 12 yr old nephew asked that MIL not come to Easter this year.", "NTA your MIL sounds like a treat.  If she wants to go to Hawaii then she can take herself there.  Also your poor wife.", "NTA. That's what toxic people do when you set boundaries with them.

Simply firmly say \"I want our vacation to just be us\" and not project that your MIL would make the vacation stressful even though true.    Part of protecting your wife is also to protect her from fallout from being overly blunt.", "NTA, but I think it is beyond time for your wife to put her mother on an information diet. Planning a tropical holiday? She can find out about it after it happened because it was a \"spur of the moment\" trip.

You described your wife as a people pleaser and you realized on here that it's most likely that your MiL planned this whole thing to manipulate your wife into agreeing to let her come on the trip. \n\nYour wife needs to grow a spine.

It's a dumb reason to let people treat you like garbage. Family are the people that love and support you and lift you up, not someone who manipulates and tears you down.\n\nSpeaking from personal experience, you learn to be a people pleaser because you're trying to manage someone else's emotions. When you grow up with someone that throws a tantrum or worse when they don't get their way, it becomes easier to just do what they want so you can avoid the blow up. It becomes a habit you practice with everyone, not just the one volatile person.

A narcissist needs stimulation and adoration. They can never be wrong or disrespected.
