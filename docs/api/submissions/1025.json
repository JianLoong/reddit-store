You may have used words that inflamed Kate; but your heart was in the right place by re-assuring Sally that yours and hers relationship will always be special and that it will not be harmed by the arrival of your own biological child.\n\nLet things cool down a bit. Then, talk with Matt about how best to reinforce that Sally's biol mom is Kate and that you have no wish to undermine THAT relationship.\n\nAnd at some point, you need to discuss with Sally the complexity of her relationships among her various parental figures -- biological, step, and ex-step.", "NAH. It's a complicated situation and everyone needs to be delicate. 12 yo girl having issues with her mother is quite typical and they'd have those same exact issues if you hadn't been in the picture at all. Maybe try to view Sally as your younger sister rather than daughter and your baby as her niece rather than younger sister. Looking at the dynamics and getting Sally see them that way might make things easier for everyone.", "NAH, probably just stress talking\n\n\nIt takes a village to raise a child, especially a preteen/teen. You are a wonderful person for staying contact with this girl and forming a healthy and positive relationship. And your heart was in the right place to reassure her that your relationship with her would not change even with your new kid. \n\nKate and Matt are probably very frustrated and stressed out with raising Sally and 12 is the age when at least one parent is on distant terms with the kid no matter what. Kate is probably holding on for dear life trying to keep a positive relationship, parent and stay connected and probably feels jealous your're having it easier and feeling threatened. And Matt is doing his job by backing her up and being her partner.\n\nI suggest taking a few days to let emotions cool and offer to talk to both of them with some coffee and snacks. Let them know you respect their relationship with Sally and how important she is to you are well and what you were trying to reassure her about. It doesn't sound like you knew anything about what's going on at home so making that clear will probs make a big difference.

If she\u2019s drifting from her parents that\u2019s very sad but it\u2019s not the result of having alternative places to go: if you were an aunt or even just a family friend that could still happen and you\u2019re not trying to displace her mother at all, you\u2019ve been very clear in your stepparent role.\n\nBoth her birth parents should understand that in allowing you to form a strong bond with their child this is a situation they created and that it really isn\u2019t a bad thing. You can all help Sally to rebuild the bonds with her mother by supporting each other\u2019s parenting styles and maintaining boundaries that are agreed between the parents.\n\nStopping her seeing you at this stage will only make the child resent her parents all the more because from her perspective it will look like they have chosen for her to be lonely and that they care more for their own jealousy and insecurity than for her happiness - and that will happen more, the less she is allowed to see you.\n\nIt seems like you need to explain to the parents that loving her is something you give to her, not something you take from them.  Either way they need some family therapy to sort this out, and you can\u2019t force them to do that but you could recommend that they do it on the grounds of rebuilding their relationship with their child rather than on the grounds of their adjusting their position to you - I think a responsible therapist in this situation would be likely to represent the child\u2019s best interests and honour and reinforce the strong bonds she has with all of you rather than to help her parents cut you off, because it would be impossible to cut you out after so many years without damaging the child\u2019s mental health at a very critical time in her development and also further damaging her parents\u2019 own relationships to her.", "NTA.\n\nYou were just comforting a child that you have bonded with and love.

(my only friends from SC to this day to visit me). just like old times. i took him for a walk, just the two of us. when he first saw me he ran up to me. that little boy will always be my first baby. despite the fact that we aren\u2019t close anymore. i have a 4.5 year old son. my twin sister has a daughter who is 7 months younger. my sister always says my son is her first baby. when you bond with a child like that - it\u2019s special. taking that away from the child is cruel. especially just because you told her she is your first baby. that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re trying to play mom. i completely understand what you meant by it. you\u2019re not trying to replace her mother at all. you\u2019re letting her know she will always have a special place in your heart. she\u2019s the one who taught you how to care for and love a child. that\u2019s it. another thing - as a mother i will never be threatened by another woman loving my child. anyone who loves my child is fine in my book. as long as they\u2019re not doing anything to hurt him, they respect me as his mother (meaning they respect my wishes like when it comes to discipline or something like that), and they bring positivity to our lives - i\u2019m all for it. if his dad and i don\u2019t work out, and he got a girlfriend \u2026 i won\u2019t hate her just to hate her. we could be friends if it worked out that way (wouldn\u2019t force it but i wouldn\u2019t completely say it\u2019s out of the question simply because she\u2019s with my ex. that\u2019s some high school shit). my point is - if someone had the relationship with my son that you have with their daughter - i would be so grateful for that. i love seeing people love my son. it makes me so happy. i want my son to be surrounded by the type of people who tell him \u201cyou\u2019ll always be my first baby.\u201d sorry for the novel.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's just what happens at that stage in life.\n\nI see the other perspective, but that's more of a selfish stance.  Kate isn't thinking about Sally's feelings, she's only thinking about her own and acting out of jealousy.  She's also blaming you for Sally's distance from her, which is just a product of nature.  Preteens start to want independence, parents push back, the kids rebel.

You're not step mom. You're dad's ex. \n\nAnd that's 100% okay. It's great you've kept up with Sally and love her.

I can even see why ex got upset/took her side.\n\nBut all that's happening is hurting a hormonal 12 year old girl, so if you're given the opportunity to make amends and fix this, it'd be great if yall would actually try. Having an extra trusted adult through puberty/teen years could be brilliant for her (heck, maybe try to mention that if you can get anyone to listen).\n\nGood luck", "*My husband says he understands my view, but that I have to remember Sally has a mother*\n\nI think your Husband sort of hit the nail on the head here. The more healthy adults around a child to love on them the better imo. But styling yourself as a 'second Mum' figure when you're not involved with Sally's father, so not a StepMum, and Sally has a present and involved Mum is tricky. In my culture, we call the adults around us 'Aunt' and 'Uncle', even for family friends etc. That allows us to have these close loving relationships like you have with Sally without overstepping on the parental roles. \n\nYou might have to check that this is really coming from Kate. It could be that Matt has a new gf who dislikes being overshadowed by an ex who is incredibly involved despite not being the mother of his kid. But either way if the parents have asked for space, it does no harm to respect that & stay in touch with Sally via phonecalls every few weeks. And then after the baby arrives inviting Kate, Matt & Sally to meet your baby as an ice-breaker. NAH", "NTA\n\nReverse the genders, and I could've written this post about 10 years ago. My child is 15 now and still sees his \"Mitchie\" every week and is always excited to do so. His father was jealous - so jealous - because he felt like his \"fatherness\" was being encroached upon. \n\nThe thing is, it wasn't. It's that his father didn't put in the effort when they had time together. He had insane rules that included not allowing him to bring his blanket (her name is Gloria, she is a penguin and I continue to protect her with my life to this day), which was his comfort thing, not letting him leave with clothes he bought, not letting him take toys home, etc. Things that caused my kid to close himself off from a close relationship with him. He also tried desperately to stop him from seeing Mitch. We broke up in 2012 but I have done everything in my power to ensure my kid continues to have time with him because I love my kid more than I was ever mad at Mitch. I did my best to make sure he never knew about this but he's not stupid. He knew I was stressed out. He knew Mitch was stressed out. And he heard the things his father said about Mitch. \n\nNow that he's at an age where he can actually articulate his feelings, he made it clear he will see his dad for a dinner or two a month but refuses to go for full weekends. Our state doesn't have a defined age line for a child to decide on visitation but I think he finally realizes he fucked up because he hasn't even tried to fight it. \n\nKate needs to understand that this could very well be her fate as well. You have a long, established and, by all accounts, loving relationship with Sally. Sally is also stumbling head-first into adolescence. It's only going to get worse for Kate, unfortunately. Telling a preteen/teen they can't do something explicitly translates into I MUST DO THIS THING.\n\nSally's feelings have to count for something. If Kate is willing to ignore them because her feelings are hurt, that's a problem you don't own and can't fix. She's most likely unable to accept that their drifting apart is related to aspects of their relationship unrelated to you but you're an easy target so unfortunately, you get the brunt of her rage. Looking inward is hard.\n\nI hope you're able to keep that connection with her. I see how my kid is when Mitch is around and his world is always a little brighter. Sally deserves that, too.", "NTA just being a good step mom. Kate needs to stop attacking you and put her energies in repairing her relationship with her daughter.", "NTA. So they think you are an aH for caring for a child? You're an AH for lifting up a child's spirits when her parents failed to? For providing a safe and comfortable environment when her parents failed to?", "YTA for saying it's slightly inappropriate for two adults to date because of a ridiculous \"AgE gAp\". There is nothing inappropriate about it whatsoever.  \n\nNTA for how you handled your \"first daughters\" reaction to your pregnancy.  Kate is the AH in that situation.", "NTA. Sally needs and love you. Only a shit parent would try to take away their child\u2019s \u2018safe person\u2019 when that person Is actually safe.", "Nah but leaning towards yta, think of this from Kate's POV, and think of how you'd feel if this was your baby", "Sally is not a child anymore, she can choose who to spend time with,", "i\u2019d say a lot of those times it does happen, it\u2019s probably the child\u2019s parent that is being a dick and doesn\u2019t want the stepparent in that kids life anymore if they\u2019re not together. parent use their kids as weapons. happens all the time.", "YTA. Instead of causing drama, you should be encouraging Sally to develop a good and healthy relationship with her mother. Sure it\u2019s fun to play cool aunt, but at the end of the day you aren\u2019t the one who has to discipline, sacrifice time, and provide financially. Come on man, you see this kid once a month and have fun of course she\u2019s gonna prefer to you Mom who has to you know, literally be the parent.\n\nI really think if you were the full time caretaker and supporting Sally financially, you would be more empathetic. As a teenager, I would have said NTA but as an adult I think differently.\n\nNot to mention there are a bunch of different ways you could have consoled Sally instead of using it to widen the divide between her and her mother. You\u2019re the adult and labels matter a lot. Not to mention, it\u2019s very cruel to tell Sally she\u2019s basically your daughter when most likely, if push comes to shove you aren\u2019t likely to step up. Are you planning on helping her with college expenses? Medical bills is she gets sick? Time and energy? No, because you are not the parent. Proceed very carefully, how are you going to handle a situation where Sally wants to live full time with you? \n\nI think it\u2019s great Sally has an adult in her life where she can vent and have a good time however this shouldn\u2019t come at the expensive of her relationship with the woman who is actually going to be there if everything goes to hell, aka her mother.", "YTA despite best intentions, you overstepped. You should apologise to Katie but ultimately its her call whether you see her daughter", "YTA, u should be trying to take a aunt or friend role on her life Not take her mothers", "YTA\n\nAnd you are an adult who knows more words than mother, father, sister, brother, etc. Like AS AN ADULT how did you think there weren\u2019t any other words you could use? \n\nYou are not her mother. Her mother never abandoned her. Your baby is not her sister. These are titles. These titles simply do not apply to you. \n\nIt\u2019s weird that you give yourself the title of mom when she already has one. Honestly it\u2019s almost creepy.", "NTA - I was in Sally\u2019s position for a bit as a kid. I would have never said I loved the other woman as much as my mother if my mother had been good at her job. If Sally is having issues with her mother that\u2019s a reflection on her parenting, not yours.", "So they just want to erase the past x number of years ? Yah okay ......", "NTA I wish everyone had the capacity to love as you do", "NTA", "NTA.  I will never understand people who think it is bad for kids to have more adults who love them.", "NTA and shame on her mama for letting her insecurities get in the way of a happy, positive relationship in her child\u2019s life. Especially now as she in a rough time and needs all the support she can get. SMH, some women.", "NTA. You didn't tell Sally you were her mother. You just told her she would always be welcome and special to you as she was the first kid you willingly, lovingly and as a stepparent figure took care of in your adult life.\n\nI see how Kate may be angry and feel threatened if Sally rather runs to you with questions about life than to her, but I hope Sally's parents will see what's best for their kid, which is allowing her to see a non harmful bonus 'adult' next to her parents, one she chose herself too.", "NTA, and cutting contact may backfire on them. It'll push her more against her mom to have them suddenly restrict access when neither of you have done anything wrong and the relationship is a healthy one. If her mom is upset, she needs to invest into her relationship with her child. If her child is angry with her, that is an issue they need to work through and between them, it's not fair to punish Sally by restricting access to you", "YTA the asshole Sally isn\u2019t your daughter and has never been your daughter. You helped take care of her in your relationship but not anymore.  You being her cool aunt absolutely fine but you should not have said she was your first baby.  There where plenty of different things you could\u2019ve said and not referred to her as your first baby", "NTA - and for Kate to take offense is very shallow and probably feels like she is competition to you!  I have this with my oldest grandlove - she has lived with us at times (short times and then once for over 7 months) and she and I are very close, sometimes her mother (my daughter) gets upset with me because grandlove will come to me - I told her I would always be there for my grandlove and would never turn her away! I do NOT pit one against the other ever and if it's a big topic I will gently steer her to her mother and tell her to \"ask your mother\".", "NTA. It takes a village to raise a child, and the more people who love that child, the better life they'll have. If, for any reason in the future, my fiance and I split up, I want his next relationship to be with someone who will love my daughter as much as we do and consider her their own child as well. I want my closest friends to be like aunts, uncles or even second parents, too. I can sort of understand why she's upset, but she should consider herself lucky that her ex was with someone who actually cared about her child. A lot of kids aren't lucky enough to have step parents who love them.", "NTA. Next steps are critical though. A lot of good advice in the comments I won't repeat, just here to day congrats, good on you for loving Sally and being there all these years in a way that enhanced all the relationships in her life, and good luck navigating this next step with your chosen extended family. Please update us, I am rooting for all of you!", "This is the way. I know Kate is feeling the competition right now, but it's fine to remind her that more people loving a kid is a good thing, and that love is not a finite resource that has to be hoarded or parsed out. There is enough room in Sally's life for every person who cares about her and loves her. Sally loving you doesn't take away from her love of Kate. Kate is feeling a lot of things right now, but what she needs to be focused on is Sally.", "[edited because I misread]\n\nIt's okay for Sally to have two moms if Sally sees both of the women who raised her as her mother.\n\nAlso I wouldn't see anything wrong with an older sibling who helped raise their younger sibling saying \"you'll always be my first baby\".  \n\nOp has raised this girl for 2/3 of her life.", "Sally is allowed to view op as her mother if that's what Sally feels.  Op has been helping to raise her for 8 years.", "You're a mature 32 year old and everything you said is spot on. My oldest grandchild does not biologically belong to us but I made a deal with his mom that my love for her son is forever. (His mom and my oldest son dated but didn't work out but they're still good friends.) My grandson has continued to spend every weekend, summers and holidays at our home since he was a baby and he's soon to be 12. With that being said I'm still very close to his mom, her husband and other children. You can't have too many people loving your children.", "Oh the baby and Sally don't share a dad. OPs husband (and her baby's dad) is someone else, not Sally's dad Matt.", "Seeing her once a month isn\u2019t \u201chelping raise her\u201d.", "absolutely! the more positive influence a child has around the better! it really does take a village!", "Ah fair enough. Still if Sally wants to see her as a mom that's Sally's right. Chosen family exists. \n\nI can absolutely see an aunt, sister, even friend telling someone \"you'll always be my first baby\"."]}
