I decided to make a lasagna for dinner. I had enough for dinner the next day since the rest of my family had dinner to go to with friends and it would be a hassle to make more food just for one person. My brother (13M) and I were supposed to go but since it's my birthday they let me stay home. I'm having my CAIE exams which, if you don't know, could make or break your future so I've been stress eating and gained weight. I lost 2kgs and have been starting to work out regularly again. \n\nSo yesterday I remembered that I had the lasagna in the fridge so it motivated me to work out more than usual. By the time I was done and showered I was very hungry and went down to eat and get back to studying. I had skipped Eid celebrations up to this point to study, which if you don't know is a large holiday for Muslims. I had already had my fair share of missing large meals I always looks forward to and having my brother rubbing it in my face so when I went downstairs to see my brother eating my Lasagna. Seeing this pushed me over the edge and I yelled at him that it was my food and that if he wanted something I could have ordered him a pizza or a burger. After this, I went to my room and just studied while being on the verge of crying. He didn't say anything at the moment but instead just smiled at me.\n\nLater my grandmother throws open my door and starts yelling at me nonstop for yelling at my brother and how I'm supposed to be the older brother. She said instead of going to dinner now she has to stay home to console my brother because he is inconsolably crying. In the background I see my brother peaking his head around the door and silently laughing. After he saw that I saw him he started to fake cry and went to my grandmother telling a wildly exaggerated story of what happened, saying that I gave him the lasagna then cussed him out for eating it while laughing and him crying etc etc. My grandmother said I'm fat enough and that I should let my brother eat now and again. Despite being 3 years younger than me, my brother is still 7 kg heavier than me partly because he always eats all the food and blames it on me. I got so mad I was so tempted to yell. I tried to tell my side of the story but I was constantly cut off. He was then given MY birthday cake to eat as a consolation. \n\nI had to go to bed hungry on my birthday. My mom just said that maybe I shouldn't have taken a long (5m) shower and left it at that. My brother has a history of doing this and eats all the snacks and blames it on me. Everyone believes him because he's \"the innocent younger brother\". He constantly swears and says racist things and when showed the proof I was called a liar and told I manipulated the images and the audio. He constantly gets C's and D's but it's fine but when I get a B suddenly I'm a disgrace to my family. \n\nSo am I the AH?", "created_utc": 1683106355, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136fn7z/aita_for_yelling_at_my_brother_for_eating_my_food/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sorry for what happened to you, but the only thing I can advise is - stop paying attention to him, don't talk about him to your family, don't try to show them his faults, etc. Distance yourself from this competition that he has going on and start thinking about your future away - what are you going to do, who do you want to be. They are not going to realize what games he is playing intil you are not around to cover up for his slack.", "NTA\n\nThat's awful. I'm imagining myself at your age and honestly the fact you haven't said you will never speak to your grandmother again is a testament to how much of a better person you are than me lol.\n\nI mean a 13 year old brat is a 13 year old brat, but that lady is grown and still decided to not hear your side of the story and gave your brother your birthday cake? She is the worst and I wouldnt forgive her easily. Or your parents. They owe you a birthday.\n\nOne thing you could maybe try is avoiding your brother and when he brings it up just say \"I don't like to spend time with people who lie to get me in trouble, steal my food and were fine with ruining my birthday and eating my cake despite knowing they were in the wrong\". Then walking away or saying nothing else to him after that if leaving isn't an option.\n\nYou may end up in trouble for that too, but if you are in a home where you are constantly in trouble even if you behave perfectly, nothing actually changes on that front. If that not the case or you would be unsafe, disregard that advice though.", "NTA - I hope when your family asks why you don\u2019t have a relationship with them after moving out you\u2019ll though that in their face.", "No you're nta, your family is ta though. No one should have to go to bed hungry on their birthday. Please know your worth (you are worth more than they want you to know), know you don't deserve this, and when you turn 18 get out while you can.

There are a few things that might help you hold on to your sanity until you're able to get away though: \n\n* React as little as possible to your brother's goading as possible. If he tries to bother you or start trouble, get up and walk away without saying anything. Keep as much distance between the two of you as possible. \n\n* If your friends have parents that are fond of you, see if you can spend time at their house more often. You need a safe space to escape to every now and then. Always take your laptop with you when you leave, and any valuables or sentimental things you have that you can't keep with you, keep in a lockbox or a hidden place. \n\n* Document all instances of goading, blaming and harassing as soon as they happen. This will keep it clear in your mind, or you run the risk of being emotionally manipulated into letting big things go. \n\n* Your food supply is unstable so it helps to have emergency stashes in places only known to you. Crackers, chips, pretzels, drinks, anything long-lasting, keep a constant supply nearby.", "NTA.. I'm sorry you have to deal with that. \nhe will get his one day, you'll be there laughing", "Nta. The case of they annoying little brother eating your food. Just do what I did, attack your little brother with his own nerf gun.  And maybe you should distance yourself if the elders are continuously making excuses for his behavior", "NTA but this'll continue until you put your brother in his place.", "Oh, hon, NTA.\n\nNot sure where you live at, but the petty in me wants to know if you can find some ghost pepper sauce and/or some of those laxatives that look like candy. Like make another batch of lasagna and cut a \"leftover\" piece for yourself. Be sneaky and put it away while no one is looking. Carefully lace the layers with the ghost pepper sauce. I mean, peel back the top layer and douse it on the inside. Or, find some  Senecot or another laxative pill; grind them up into a powder, peel the top layer and generously sprinkle the inside. Pat it back down, wrap it up, stick it in the fridge. Tell your brother \"That's mine. Don't eat it\". (He will.) Then watch him pay the piper.\n\nYes, I know. I shouldn't be so mean. But, I grew up with a brother and 7 older cousins who made my life a bit hellish with pranks and stealing out of my piggy bank and stealing my goodies from Easter and Christmas stockings. I think it may have come to a head when my brother put a tarantula in my bed. I drew back the covers and there was this poor thing, size of my dad's hand, doing the tarantula equivalent of \"WTAFH MAN!?!\". It startled me, but not in the way they were hoping. (I am not afraid of spiders) I heard laughter and knew they had done it. Took me a good half hour to coax the poor thing into calming down enough to crawl into my hand so I could take it back outside. Next morning, I was up and out the door with the sun. Went and caught what I thought was a baby garter snake, came back home, snuck in the back door and waited for my mom not to be paying attention. I put the baby snake inside my brother's lunchbox, under the sandwich.\n\nLater that day, all hell broke loose. Apparently, it wasn't a baby garter snake; it was a baby rattlesnake. When my dad found out why I did it, well, not only did my brother get a whipping, he got grounded. And my 3 boy cousins got their butts beat and grounded. I got my butt beat and grounded. There was a declaration that if any of us pulled another prank on anyone, didn't matter, they'd get their butts beat and grandpa would use them in place of his mule.\n\nYes, I am kind of old. 55. So, that should tell you about the mindsets I grew up with.\n\nBut, yeah, you could break him of that behavior really quick. Just be prepared to suffer consequences if you do go that route.\n\nI am very sorry you are going through this. It's never a good thing to grow up in an environment where you aren't one of the favored kids. Literally, it is psychological torture that leaves scars (I have some really horrific ones from it myself). However, I strongly encourage you to focus on your studies and use them as a way out. Use your education as a springboard to a good job that can take you OUT of that situation. Then go and don't look back. Your culture might put a lot of empathsis on family and whatnot, but realize that you do not have to submit yourself to that for the rest of your life. And family is not always about biological ties. \n\nMy best advice is to focus on your studies, maintain excellent grades, take advantage of any and all scholarships offered to you, take advantage of any internships offered to you then get a job and solidify plans to move far away. It's going to take you some time, but focus on the end goal. I believe in you. Love and hugs.", "NTA but your family sure is.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My parents have threatened to take away my laptop and already have given MY ps4, which I got from a friend group as a birthday gift so I could play with them and give it to my brother because he \"felt left out\" and \"you're old now and need to cous on studies hence don't need this\" thay happened when I was 10 and he was 7.

Currently it's all in an account I will inherit when I turn 18.", "Ok let me breakdown the flaws with every point though I do appreciate the attempt  \n\n\n1. Ok, so when I did try to do this he cried bloody murder and said I was ignoring him on purpose. Then I was yelled at for doing this and ruining him and me knowing he needs special care (no he does not have any illness). Then I was once again scolded and he was given something of mine to make up for it. I was also told I was the reason nobody at school liked him, which is not true. That would be because he yelled the N-word at a black man in recess and everyone heard it. They all empathise with me and hate him after that. That was in grade 7.\n2. I do have parents of friends who really love me and friends who I'm really close with but my mom gives me specific timings every month when I'm allowed to visit my friends which can also be over ruled by my brother if he wants to go somewhere else. Also, he gets to go whenever and stay as long as he wants at his friend's houses. I can't lock anything in my room because of my mom's rules and my brother will once again complain and it will be permanently given to my brother. I can't take any items along with me because my mom would catch on to what I'm doing. Also, my room has absolutely zero hiding spaces as it's my mom and dad's old room before they refurnished the upstairs storage (it is a huge storage room) to be theirs and let my brother choose which room he wants and obviously, he chose mine.\n3. This I will actually do because that is really good. Thank you for that. It'll stop me from thinking I'm the villain in all of this and keep my mind at least stable\n4. I can't do this since we have a huge ant problem in the house and anytime I've tried this the ants have gotten to it first.", "Thank you.

As a matter of fact, I have ghost peppers and ghost pepper extract available. I love spice and put it on almost everything I eat. While this might be funny to watch, unfortunately, my mom would take everything of mine and probably restrict food even more. I feel really bad all day now and am struggling to maintain good grades especially as all my tuition teachers also put additional pressure on me to succeed after hearing who my dad is. However, I will keep trying and breaking free. My plan is to wait until my dad gets an off day so I can talk to him about all of this. He always believes me and doesn't put much pressure on me. Unfortunately due to his job, I barely get to see him but when I do he always makes it worth it. He also never puts work ahead of important events for me as well so I'm just waiting until his work gives him a day off.", "Besides my Father and Grandfather I would have to agree", "Dang I'm sorry...", "May have to tale out loans then...hope they don't earn too much money so you can get FAFSA.", "I'm afraid you will have to develop a thicker skin about this.

You could try fight for yourself as \"Why am I the topic again when you were talking about my brother?\" or some other teenage passive aggressive way of saying \"Yes, I know you believe it is always my fault.\" but basically there is nothing else to do. Your younger brother is a brat. Either he is getting spoiled by family, or it is just early-teen years and he will outgrow it. In any case, don't burn any bridges, but keep your sanity and energy for protecting your mental health and just look towards the future.

It was the fact that it didn't change and now he's breaking stuff as well like my glass chess board I get on my 14th birthday that's made me very mad.
