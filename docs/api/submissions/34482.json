I find having a hard time punishing her or holder her accountable because she is not my actual daughter and I don't want to make thinks weird.\n\nMy phone charger went missing, and it keeps randomly appearing then moving. I've asked everyone where it is and no one knows so after two weeks of not being able to charge my phone consistently I went into my daughters room. Zara and my daughter share a room, and while searching I found alcohol. I don't know what to do? I know it's A's, because I found it on her side.\n\nZara takes school online and doesn't really have friends, she's already house kept. So I don't know about anyway of punishing her. I've heard from my daughter that Zara has found other accommodations but still chose to stay with us. I don't really want to kick her out. Maybe if I say if it happens again I will?\n\nIf this was my child this would be competently different. So if making threats would be bad what should I do so this completely stops? I don't want to got to extreme measures and my son says he listens to a lot of reddit so maybe you can help.\n\nEdit: I just weed pen in her room as well, I\u2019m from the USA aswell \n\nEdit2: Hello All thank you for your input. I talked to her and I\u2019m giving her three months to make better choices and if not I\u2019ll decide later if she has to move out. I\u2019m going to talk to my daughter as well.

Have you thought about what happens when she turns 18? Will you continue to support her? \n\nShe also likely needs counseling to work through whatever situation she had with her parents that resulted in them abandoning her and that abandonment itself (source: I was abandoned by my parents as a teen).

Wouldn't follow the rules, started fights, committed crimes, etc. The staff in every group home and independent living program I ever went to was extremely nice and the rules really weren't all that wild, and got more lax the better you behaved. \n\nIn the IL program I was in from 18-21 the staff basically just let me do whatever I wanted because I was responsible, well-behaved, and self-motivated, and they had bigger fish to fry. \nLike one of my roommates trashed our apartment, did coke on our living room table, had some older dude fresh out of prison for aggravated assault and grievous bodily harm over and was drinking 40s and smoking Black and Milds with him.

Not asleep by bedtime? Find a bed somewhere else!  Put the tp on the wrong way? Straight to jail.", "As someone who\u2019s served my community for years I\u2019ve seen it first hand in that aspect. Growing up my childhood best friends mother had foster children always and while the ones she had flourished it was a fight and they had awful histories with other families. That might be the first \u201csuccess story\u201d I\u2019ve ever heard from foster care. I also now work closely with at risk populations and can absolutely attest that putting a kid in the system at 16 is not going to be beneficial. \n\nThanks for asking tho \ud83d\ude05", "Sounds like your basis for \"the vast majority\" of foster care experiences being bad is knowing the mom of one foster family. I'll definitely trust my 8 years actually in the system, meeting group home workers, social workers, foster kids, and foster families over that lol.\n\nMy primary reason for vehemently rebuking people's unfounded fear of CPS is that the trauma of being in CPS is far less than that of being in an abusive household. My mom told me all sorts of shit about CPS because they'd taken my sister before I was born and she didn't want me getting into CPS, and that combined with all the bullshit the internet and media in general spread about CPS put me off calling them. I should've called them myself years before I stumbled into their care by chance, and I strongly encourage any kid in an abusive situation to call them. As long as you can self-advocate, you can get through the system just fine and come out on top.", "Dude I know several families that are foster parents and those kids are out through hell. I'm glad you had a good time but that doesn't make you an expert.", "Sounds like your evidence is your very limited experience when the person you responded to actually spoke about working with at risk populations beyond their friend's mom who fostered kids. Maybe try to use your brain next time instead of getting your panties in a wad, cupcake.", "I spent 6 years in the system. You were extremely lucky. Like hit the jackpot lucky. \n\nI wasn't a wild out of control kid, I was a severely abused child and all that happened for me is more abuse. That's from the kids I know and  adults who survived it the norm. \n\nStop acting like your singular experience is the truth for everyone.", "So those families are abusive? Or their parents were abusive and CPS got them out and into non-abusive families?", "At risk populations =/= foster children. Dude could be working with domestic abuse survivors, the homeless, drug addicts, etc. Foster children are a very specific group, at risk population is an umbrella term.", "It's the truth for literally everyone I met lol."]}
