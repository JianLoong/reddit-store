He was a sweet man, but towards the end he started to become hostile towards me and I found out he was sleeping with other girls. My entire family knows the full story and exactly what happened. However, my mother (54) is acting like he is some sort of saint in this situation. She keeps telling me that he was a good man, and I shouldn\u2019t hate him. She tells me I was too harsh and that we are \u201csoulmates\u201d and that \u201cshe truly loves him so much and he will always have her heart\u201d almost every day. She even tried telling me he didn\u2019t even cheat on me. As much as this frustrated me, I ignored it because I did not want to start an argument with my mom.  However, my breaking point was a few days ago when I was catching up with family members who haven\u2019t seen me in a few years, and our relationship came into the conversation. They asked me for a photo of him. I told them I didn\u2019t have one because all photos of us were wiped off my phone. My mom looked at me stunned and told me \u201cWait, all of them? Are you sure?\u201d and I told her again I had no pictures of us together or of him anymore. She then told me that I shouldn\u2019t have done that because of \u201chappy memories.\u201d I immediately turned to her fuming and asked her \u201cWere you sleeping with him too or something? Do you want him too? Why do you care so much about him?\u201d She got red from ear to ear, got up, and sprinted out of the room while on the verge of tears. My family members told me that was uncalled for and I was too harsh and I should apologize to her immediately. I refused, and my family members ended up leaving a few minutes later. I haven\u2019t talked to her since. Am I the asshole?

Wonder if he wasn't messaging and begging your Mom to manipulate to get you back together", "NTA.  One small thing, though.  I try not to ask questions that I don't want the answer to.  If your mom had said yes, then... well, you did get your answer.  Awkward.  Sorry.", "Hahaha nope, NTA at all. The one person that you're supposed to be able to rely on for a bit of comfort in a situation like this is your mum. Yet she's gone out of her way to make this break up as hard as possible for you. My mum was a bit like this with one of my break ups and there were other instances of her not being there for me. Anyway, long story short, I live in another country now and only see my parents once a year. Don't get me wrong, I love them, but whenever something bad happens I don't get the urge to contact them for support. I've built my own support system. If your mother continues with this kind of behaviour, she's going to find herself on the receiving end of a very perfunctory relationship with you.", "NTA. Sure, you were harsh but your mom needs to butt out of your love life. You'd think your mom would want better for you than some guy who\u2019d become hostile to you and been cheating, whether physically or emotionally. If it was physically, get a STD test and be sure to share the results with your mom whichever way it goes.", "NTA", "Maybe she was\n\nNTA", "Info \u2014 have you asked your mother directly why she believes he\u2019s such a great guy? Is your Mom divorced?", "NTA. That made me smile so hard my cheeks hurt!", "NTA and I think your mother dost protest too much. I doubt she was sleeping with him (though it's certainly possible) but she definitely had a crush on him. You do not owe her an apology. She needs to back off.", "This is tricky for me to judge, because she's clearly wrong about him in general. The previous comments she made are weird, unhelpful and seemingly incorrect (like saying he didn't cheat). But.. deleting all the pictures of the two of you seems like it would involve deleting most pictures of special events that happened between the ages of 17 and 20. And I can see the logic of thinking that you will regret that decision down the line. Not because he's secretly a good guy (or your soul mate!!), but because it was your life. \n\nIf I based my judgement solely on the event in question, then I'd say that you overreacted to that comment and did go off on your mum in front of a bunch of people. If I add in the context, your reaction is understandable. You're reacting to the build-up, rather than the actual comment made.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It makes me wonder if she is the sort of woman that is like, \"men can't help but cheat... it is just how they are made.\" Or some other BS so she doesn't see it as a big deal.  I wonder what sort of man your dad is or was now because her reaction makes me wonder what she put up with in her own life.", "Lol what would you have done if she said yes\u2026", "NTA. I can\u2019t help but feel like something DEFINITELY went on between your mom and him. I know, because I\u2019ve already been through that, and your mom is showing the same signs\u2026", "NTA, and I think her reaction was everything. It\u2019s extremely cringe and messed up that she kept trying to rewrite history and say he didn\u2019t cheat on you. But yes, she obviously was/ is in love with him. Her reaction is an obvious tell, and the way she\u2019s handled your breakup is disgusting. Probably would have been a better thing to do in private, but I doubt it would have had a better effect with her.", "NTA\n\nAnd it sounds like you hit on something =/", "her reaction is a bit\u2026 i mean i wasn\u2019t gonna say it! but when you\u2019re poking around in the dark people don\u2019t usually shout that loud if you don\u2019t hit bullseye. maybe mom *was* thirsty.", "He was a sweet man.\n\nHow old was this sweet man? For it to be more likely your mother to like him, he should at least be a several years older than you.\n\nThe younger he was, the weirder your mothers behaviour.", "NTA.\n\nSeriously, your Mom has some major psych issues going on.  She needs professional help.\n\nYou were a little bit harsh with her- but not inappropriately or undeservedly so. A normal reaction would have been for her to have either been hurt, or gotten upset and clapped back at you.  Her reaction was. . . super cringy.  You didn't hit a nerve there, OP- you hit the freakin' brain stem.", "Nta.  That's weird and she's acting sus.", "NTA.", "NTA especially since she didn't answer you.", "NTA, your mom is being very inappropriate. If anything, you should have said something sooner, and maybe the frustration you were feeling wouldn't have built up as it did, but I can't blame you for avoiding confronting your mom.\n\nI don't know what's wrong with your mom, but does she have a son? Not that it justifies her behavior, but some people carry their gender disappointment for a long time.", "Jesus Christ.

You both need a checkup from the neck up .", "I have to go with ESH.  You said your mom has been doing this almost every day.  You also asked if you were the A because you didn't keep silent as you \"always have.\"  So while your mom is the worst here, you've let this go on and on and only choose to say something embarrassing to her in front of other family?  You should have handled this the first time your mom said something.", "NTA. I can only imagine that she's made her own fidelity compromises in her relationships. Maybe she feels guilty about those and instead of confronting that guilt, she's projecting it onto you by acting like you should act how she did. That deserves being called out. What she is doing is not support. And it isn't loving.", "My thoughts exactly. Not hurt, not angry, not indignant- a totally uncalled for and over-the-top reaction from Mom.", "I was going for more of the perfect SIL that she could brag about and be the envy of her friends. Good thing OP isn't easily manipulated.", "Some women like younger men.", "Umm maybe? But it\u2019s pretty odd that her mom was still that pushy about reconnecting with her ex and trying to not say he cheated over just being a \u201cperfect MIL\u201d. But maybe.", "Not a problem per se, but there is a difference of 34 years between OP and her mother...", "Yikes, I hope you warmed up before that stretch. \ud83d\ude02", "It\u2019s certainly creepy, I agree with you there. I\u2019m just saying that I can see it happen. Assuming the mother DID actually sleep with OP\u2019s ex boyfriend, of course.
