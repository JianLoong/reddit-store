He was a sweet man, but towards the end he started to become hostile towards me and I found out he was sleeping with other girls. My entire family knows the full story and exactly what happened. However, my mother (54) is acting like he is some sort of saint in this situation. She keeps telling me that he was a good man, and I shouldn\u2019t hate him. She tells me I was too harsh and that we are \u201csoulmates\u201d and that \u201cshe truly loves him so much and he will always have her heart\u201d almost every day. She even tried telling me he didn\u2019t even cheat on me. As much as this frustrated me, I ignored it because I did not want to start an argument with my mom.  However, my breaking point was a few days ago when I was catching up with family members who haven\u2019t seen me in a few years, and our relationship came into the conversation. They asked me for a photo of him. I told them I didn\u2019t have one because all photos of us were wiped off my phone. My mom looked at me stunned and told me \u201cWait, all of them? Are you sure?\u201d and I told her again I had no pictures of us together or of him anymore. She then told me that I shouldn\u2019t have done that because of \u201chappy memories.\u201d I immediately turned to her fuming and asked her \u201cWere you sleeping with him too or something? Do you want him too? Why do you care so much about him?\u201d She got red from ear to ear, got up, and sprinted out of the room while on the verge of tears. My family members told me that was uncalled for and I was too harsh and I should apologize to her immediately. I refused, and my family members ended up leaving a few minutes later.

Wonder if he wasn't messaging and begging your Mom to manipulate to get you back together", "NTA.  One small thing, though.  I try not to ask questions that I don't want the answer to.  If your mom had said yes, then... well, you did get your answer.  Awkward.  Sorry.", "Hahaha nope, NTA at all. The one person that you're supposed to be able to rely on for a bit of comfort in a situation like this is your mum. Yet she's gone out of her way to make this break up as hard as possible for you. My mum was a bit like this with one of my break ups and there were other instances of her not being there for me. Anyway, long story short, I live in another country now and only see my parents once a year. Don't get me wrong, I love them, but whenever something bad happens I don't get the urge to contact them for support. I've built my own support system. If your mother continues with this kind of behaviour, she's going to find herself on the receiving end of a very perfunctory relationship with you.", "NTA. Sure, you were harsh but your mom needs to butt out of your love life. You'd think your mom would want better for you than some guy who\u2019d become hostile to you and been cheating, whether physically or emotionally. If it was physically, get a STD test and be sure to share the results with your mom whichever way it goes.", "NTA", "Maybe she was\n\nNTA", "Info \u2014 have you asked your mother directly why she believes he\u2019s such a great guy? Is your Mom divorced?", "NTA. That made me smile so hard my cheeks hurt!", "NTA and I think your mother dost protest too much. I doubt she was sleeping with him (though it's certainly possible) but she definitely had a crush on him. You do not owe her an apology. She needs to back off.", "This is tricky for me to judge, because she's clearly wrong about him in general. The previous comments she made are weird, unhelpful and seemingly incorrect (like saying he didn't cheat). But.. deleting all the pictures of the two of you seems like it would involve deleting most pictures of special events that happened between the ages of 17 and 20. And I can see the logic of thinking that you will regret that decision down the line. Not because he's secretly a good guy (or your soul mate!!), but because it was your life. \n\nIf I based my judgement solely on the event in question, then I'd say that you overreacted to that comment and did go off on your mum in front of a bunch of people. If I add in the context, your reaction is understandable. You're reacting to the build-up, rather than the actual comment made.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
