The one person that you're supposed to be able to rely on for a bit of comfort in a situation like this is your mum. Yet she's gone out of her way to make this break up as hard as possible for you. My mum was a bit like this with one of my break ups and there were other instances of her not being there for me. Anyway, long story short, I live in another country now and only see my parents once a year. Don't get me wrong, I love them, but whenever something bad happens I don't get the urge to contact them for support. I've built my own support system. If your mother continues with this kind of behaviour, she's going to find herself on the receiving end of a very perfunctory relationship with you.", "NTA. Sure, you were harsh but your mom needs to butt out of your love life. You'd think your mom would want better for you than some guy who\u2019d become hostile to you and been cheating, whether physically or emotionally.

I doubt she was sleeping with him (though it's certainly possible) but she definitely had a crush on him. You do not owe her an apology. She needs to back off.", "This is tricky for me to judge, because she's clearly wrong about him in general. The previous comments she made are weird, unhelpful and seemingly incorrect (like saying he didn't cheat). But.. deleting all the pictures of the two of you seems like it would involve deleting most pictures of special events that happened between the ages of 17 and 20. And I can see the logic of thinking that you will regret that decision down the line. Not because he's secretly a good guy (or your soul mate!!), but because it was your life. \n\nIf I based my judgement solely on the event in question, then I'd say that you overreacted to that comment and did go off on your mum in front of a bunch of people. If I add in the context, your reaction is understandable. You're reacting to the build-up, rather than the actual comment made.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It makes me wonder if she is the sort of woman that is like, \"men can't help but cheat... it is just how they are made.\" Or some other BS so she doesn't see it as a big deal.

She needs professional help.\n\nYou were a little bit harsh with her- but not inappropriately or undeservedly so.

But I certainly give you a pass on the level of provocation she has put in here.....to be clear - I'm more concerned about fallout with your extended family for **you** if they are seeing this come out of left field.\n\nnow your mother is definitely an asshole, and confidentially, between you and me, I think you should consider if she is narcissistic and/or caters to and craves all male attention. In this sense, you don't matter very much because you are female (and/or a scapegoat to her narcissistic self) whereas your bf was a male that she got attention from for something or other.
