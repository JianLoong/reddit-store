Our mother and her ex husband are taking turns watching the two kids, taking them to school, appointments etc. Anyway, I recently found out that the reason she left her husband was because she found a wealthy older man.

It was clear she has no feelings for him she never once spoke about his person she only talked about his money and his possessions. I told her she was selfish and acting like a child and I told her she doesn't deserve happiness. My mom said I'm immature and told me I'm not allowed to come to Christmas and she has since blocked me.

But what you said was out of line and, frankly, the situation is not really your business.  The Christmas ban seems a bit heavy-handed but probably all of you need to take a break and get some help, especially for the sake of the kids who are caught in this Peyton Place drama.", "ESH, yes she\u2019s a shitty person for doing this to her ex-husband, but it\u2019s also not any of your business.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
