(Sorry for the weird formatting)\n\nContext:\n\nI currently live with my father (44m), my stepmother (43f), my younger step brother (16m), and my biological brother (9m). My bio brother who I will call Bailey jumps back and forth between my father and my biological mother's (37f) house every 7 days.\n\nI used to do the same, but after I came out in 2022 as trans I have since cut off all contact with my bio mother and her family. I have given her multiple chances of redeeming herself but after I moved out of her house because of her husband, she didn't bother trying to make plans with me anymore even if I was asking her to hang out.\n\nShe has shown on multiple occasions that she is either transphobic, or is fine with transphobia. She  married someone who is transphobic (47m) and he tried to tell Bailey that he can't call me by my new name or new pronouns and more. (I would give more examples but character limit)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I haven't spoken to my bio mom, her husband, his kid (10m) since May of 2022. My close family knows exactly how I feel about her and her new family.\n\nNow, my father told me that my bio mother, her new family, and Bailey were coming over because Bailey wanted to show them the new kitten we got recently. I was of course not happy with it but I just went up into my room and closed my door.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen they arrive. I hear Bailey showing his stepbrother (Dylan) around the house and I quickly get up and stand by my bathroom door (Bailey and I have a bathroom in between our rooms - look up Jack and Jill bathroom) because I hear them in there. When Bailey tries to open the door to my room from inside the bathroom, I hold it shut. So Bailey goes around to my main door and I open it and tell him that I don't want Dylan to see my room. Bailey gets a little upset but leaves me alone.\n\nSo I'm sitting at my desk working on stuff and I hear the boys in the bathroom again and 5 seconds later, Bailey is opening my door. I immediately tell them to shut my door but Dylan comes in and I tell them to get out, and they do. Then I spent the next few minutes trying to calm myself down because I'm always extremely paranoid that my bio mother will seek me out and come talk to me, which she has done before.\n\nAfter an annoying half an hour of them being here, they leave without any further incident.  I eventually go downstairs and my father asks me why I was an asshole to Bailey. I tell him that I don't want anything to do with them. He says I'm being an asshole and that I have to stay civil.\n\nTLDR: Transphobic bio mother's step kid tries to come into my room - I tell my bio brother the step kid isn't allowed in my room - my bio dad calls me an asshole for it.\n\nSo, AITA for not allowing Bailey to include my room in the house tour he was giving Dylan? My father thinks I am the asshole because I didn't let him see my room. I feel like I probably could've been nicer, but that doesn't make me an asshole.

I am not saying you owe HER anything, but you owe it to yourself to be a good person and you had a chance to show that. You could have said \"Hey guys, I'm not comfortable showing my room, maybe another time\" or even \"Thanks for taking an interest, but I don't like other people in there.\" \n\nDid you stop and think that maybe that kid doesn't know all the drama that surrounds your relationship with your mom? Maybe Bailey looks up to you as his cool big brother and wants to show off because the other kid is missing out.\n\nAt the end of the day, your maturity and being able to rise above someone else's opinions will speak volumes of your character.

But stop being a pain in the ass for everybody else.", "I left it out for the sake of the character limit, but while I was living with my bio mother, her husband, Dylan, and Bailey, Dylan terrorized me constantly. I knew him for a few weeks before my bio mother forced us all to move in together, even though she said she was going to wait a few months. I realize I probably hold an unfair grudge against Dylan, but even when I did give him a chance he was a little terror and is honestly a bad influence on Bailey.\nI don\u2019t treat Bailey like shit, either. I love him, when he came to my door I said \u201cI don\u2019t want you guys in here.\u201d And he said \u201cWhy? I\u2019m giving him a tour!\u201d I responded with \u201cI don\u2019t want people in my room right now, I\u2019m working on stuff.\u201d\nI might\u2019ve been a little aggressive, due to the threat of my bio mother, but I did not treat him like shit. When it\u2019s his week with us, I try to make up for the years when I was an asshole to him due to what we were all going through, and he treated me the same."]}
