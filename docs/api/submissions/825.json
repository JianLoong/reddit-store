{"id": 825, "submission_id": "yjqc6m", "title": "AITA for locking my room door bc my suitemate has sex in there without my permission", "selftext": "I'm a college sophomore living in a suite with four other people. The suite is split into three rooms (for simplicity; rooms 1, 2, and 3) with two girls in each. Most of us know each other, but I'm good friends with the people in room 3, and old friends with one of the girls in room 2 (the other person in room 2 is a random). I got room 1 all to myself with an extra bed available for pals wanting to sleepover.\n\nA few weeks ago I walked into the suite early from a sleepover and noticed that the extra bed in my room was messy, even though I remembered making it. I brushed it off, crawled into my bed, and slept. I woke up an hour later to the sound of an iPhone pinging in my room (like when you activate it from your apple watch) and in walks my friend from room 2, who we'll call Anna. I groggily ask her why her phone is in my room (there was no reason why she should've been in there). She smirks and says \"We need to talk\".\n\nAnna tells me that the night before she went to her sports teams' party, hooked up with one of teammates, and had sex with her in my extra bed, all without my knowing. She explained that she was too drunk to lmk in the heat of the moment and left for her room. A few hours later she emerged and I explained to her that while I'm happy for any of the suitemates to use the extra bed, it's still my room, and I would at the very least appreciate a text to lmk, and clean sheets if any intercourse took place. She seemed to understand and we left it at that.\n\nEverything was fine until I went home for the weekend. Saturday morning I call my good friend in room 3, Sam, and while catching up she asks if I had left the door to my room open. I hadn't, and someone was asleep in the extra bed.\n\nI immediately called Anna and asked if she was in my room. She said no, her teammate (the one she fucked) was asleep in the extra bed. She started to explain but I cut her off, asking why she didn't think to text me first, how I had established that boundary and she broke it, how I was going to lock the door to my room because she clearly can't respect my space. She shot back saying that I never set any boundaries, that I'm \"dramatizing\" things by wanting to lock my door (for the record, Sam was THERE when I told her my conditions for using the extra bed/ going into my room, so that was bullshit). I said that she should've texted me regardless, especially knowing how uncomfortable I was with it the first time. Anna then unenthusiastically apologized and said it won't happen again and I hung up. She's been an ice queen with every interaction since.\n\nWhile Anna said that no sex took place in the extra bed this weekend (don't know how trustworthy that statement is) I was still so hurt by her lack of respect for me and my space. So reddit, AITA for \"dramatizing\" the situation by locking my room? Should I loosen up? or is locking my door appropriate?\n\nEDIT: Just to make some things clear, both me and Anna are f19. Anna's fuck buddy is also female and I've met her multiple times - I actually quite like her. My issue isn't that she's having sex in the extra bed or letting guests stay there when I'm not there (which I feel all suitemates have a right to - it's not fair that I'm the only one with the right to the extra bed) but that she's doing it despite my one condition, which is to let me know first. I know a majority of the people in the suite and trust them with the door unlocked (well up until now) and want to solve this in the most mature way possible. I still have 6 months left of living with her..", "created_utc": 1667348962, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjqc6m/aita_for_locking_my_room_door_bc_my_suitemate_has/", "score": 1019, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Anna doesn\u2019t sound like someone who cares very much about other peoples things. I\u2019m guessing she would just deny and say that OP probably lost it or broke it herself.", "But there's still a mental difference between breaking an entering to have sex versus just opening the door.\n\nHopefully the lock alone is a big enough deterrent.", "Bad bot.", "Boy, you sound like a ton of fun to live with. Why don\u2019t you swap rooms with someone and  then you won\u2019t need to spend so much time worrying if other people are having sex in the bed you\u2019re not using.", "just out of curiosity: why do you have no roommate while the other ones do? I guess they are jelous of your situation", "INFO: Do all of you pay the same amount for rent/board fees/whatever it's called?", "Yeah, forget that. You don\u2019t have to give up your privacy and take a shared room because Anna is having sex with everyone who looks at her sideways. She can work out a schedule\nOr sock on the door or whatever for her own room or go to her sex buddy\u2019s apartment. Remove the sheets from the bed and lock the door. It\u2019s still your room and honestly it\u2019s not safe for you to allow whatever random\nFriend or fling of\nYour roommates to stay in there, especially when you\u2019re not there.", "This is tricky because on one hand, you have no more right to the extra space than anyone else, but on the other hand, not everyone else has to deal with a semi-public space being in their room.\n\nI think you need to chill out a bit and try to come up with a system that feels fair. Talk with the rest of the suite about it too so everyone is in agreement.", "Found the roommate!", "Found the shagger", "How about people just don\u2019t have sex on OPs bed? It\u2019s not that hard", "It's not just about sex in a empty bed. It's her room. \nHer stuff is in that room. Would you appreciate someone you lived with brought strangers into your room? \nIf something broke... was stolen. Or if OP came home early and walking in on them just banging in the room? \nWho says they only used the bed? That's just a no. You don't just wander into someone's bedroom.", "Look being available for friends to sleep in is a hell of a lot different than being the designated bang bed.\n\nSorry, but I\u2019d be open to sleeping guests but I find it insanely inappropriate and rude to enter someone\u2019s room with the sole purpose of having sex. Gross.\n\nEta: a guest bed doesn\u2019t absolve you from giving a heads up that a potential stranger is using the room. That\u2019s just a courtesy and common sense. Otherwise I\u2019d be telling my guests that Anna\u2019s room is available to wander around in and snoop.", "Most people would consider that room the room of the person it\u2019s assigned to unless they explicitly give permission to use the bed as a guest one. OP gave permission as long they let her know, which her roommate failed to do so she\u2019s rightfully rescinding that permission. Kind of worrying you think that a spare bed in someone else\u2019s room is just free to use for everyone without permission", "me setting those boundaries was my way of being cool with it and i felt like a compromise. how can i trust her now that\u2019s she\u2019s broken those boundaries? i genuinely don\u2019t know what to do ;-;", "I wish", "Yea, I bet dollars to donuts the at least touched something else. Maybe it is the veteran in me, or the fact my Father was a career Marine, but we lock doors. Always. No one can steal, in theory anyway, if your door is locked. They will have to put in a ton of effort, but don't make it easy for people to pull shit like this.", "Exactly. This is why you\u2019re NTA", "NTA, you have a right to protect your boundaries, but it is a tough situation because you have a privilege they don't. Maybe the simplest solution is to sit down with all of your flatmates and tell them you don't mind letting them use the bed, but don't want your room to be used as the sex/guest room. So if they want privacy they can arrange with you and their roommates to sleep in the spare bed and use their own space for sex/guests.", "\u201cI completely understand why she did it and sympathise with her, but I\u2019m going to get angry anyway,\u201d. Oh dear.", "When did I say OP was wrong for locking her door? Reread my original comment, you're saying what I said. It's her room, her rules.\n\nMy point was it's not insane to think the spare bed could be used for guests, but they have to respect her space which means asking permission.", "Clearly", "No way. It\u2019s not just a guest bed because it is *in her room*- with all her personal belongings. I\u2019d the other roommates don\u2019t want her guests wandering in and out of their rooms, they still need to clear any \u201cguests\u201d with her. And it\u2019s not the bang bed for whoever brings over a fling, especially not if it\u2019s made up with her sheets."]}
