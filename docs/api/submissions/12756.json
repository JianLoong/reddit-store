I have 2 younger siblings (28M and 27F) and my sister recently got engaged to FBIL (23M) after dating him for around a year. We all know him well and I have always got along with him. He comes from a rough background but he has always been very polite and charming. He doesn't talk about his own family or about his upbringing. My sister said it's a painful topic for him so no one ever pushed. \n\nThere was recently a family event which FBIL attended. He was quiet during the day (he is normally high-energy and sociable) then disappeared for a while. When I went outside for some fresh air I bumped into him. He was emotional and said it was a hard day for him due to negative associations. He ended up offloading some quite shocking things from his past including that he has a history of very serious drug use (including needles) and that he has done sex work and p\\*\\*n (men and women). I felt for him at the time because he was so upset (literally crying on my shoulder) but afterwards I felt more and more uncomfortable. I still feel bad for him since he clearly regrets it but it's very shocking to find out he has that kind of history and it does make me feel differently about him.   \n\nObviously I told my husband what FBIL told me because I didn't feel comfortable keeping it to myself. I also told my sister because I didn't know how honest he had been with her and it could impact on her decision to marry him. She was angry and said she was fully aware and it doesn't make her think less of him. I know others might disagree but I decided if my sister and FBIL weren't going to bring it up then it was my responsibility to make sure my family had the information they needed to make an informed choice about what kind of relationship they have with him. My parents agreed that it was the right thing to do and were grateful. My brother said he could see my point but didn't think it was my responsibility to share that information. My brother's wife thought I was out of line.   \n\nWhen my sister found out I told our family about FBIL's sketchy past, she was very angry. She is now refusing to speak to me altogether because apparently this has affected FBIL quite badly. They are no longer engaged because \"he thinks he's not good enough for her\" and no one in my family has seen him since all of this happened. Obviously that wasn't my intention and no one said \"he isn't good enough\". I think it's naive to pretend that you see someone exactly the same way after finding out they're an addict, whether you like it or not there are risks that come with that lifestyle and relapses are common. I'm concerned that my sister will get hurt and I don't think it's unreasonable for my family to have access to the same information I do, especially when they're inviting him to their homes and there are children around etc.   \n\nAITA for informing my family about FBIL's background?", "created_utc": 1679323338, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11wko7b/aita_for_exposing_my_future_bils_shady_past_to_my/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He confided in you because he mistook you for a kind-hearted and good person who he could trust to comfort him and not judge him for a past he overcame and got himself out of, and you reacted by showing your true colors, and proving him wrong on every count. You judged him for having a rough past, ignoring the fact that overcoming it makes him stronger and more moral than you, who I\u2019m guessing by your pearl-clutching and judgmental attitude, has had an easier life with every advantage to not go down the paths he did. He struggled and fought to get to where he is today, and somehow you think that makes him lesser than you? It doesn\u2019t. And now you\u2019ve ruined your sister\u2019s relationship because are too narrow minded to know there is a difference between who he was, and who he is now.

You seem super judgey. None of those things have any affect on who he is as a person and there is no \u201cinformed decision\u201d that your parents need to make, nor is it any of your business. Have some empathy.", "YTA what did you think would happen when you humiliated him, that he would brush it off and carry on? Shameful.", "YTA\n\nIt wasn't your responsibility. It wasn't any kind of responsibility. \n\nBut you are a major asshole for deciding that the ex-FBIL is still an addict and somehow a lessor person for having done sex work. \n\nWTF is wrong with you? Addicts recover. They don't live that lifestyle when they are recovered. I don't think people should judge people who do sex work as lessor people, so I already think you are massive asshole for having that attitude. But you are an extra supreme asshole for judging your FBIL negatively for sex work that obviously tramatised him. It's highly likely he only did sex work out of desperation while he was in a bad way, as opposed to doing it for just regular work. You have the gall to judge him for that? And to out him? To pretend he's somehow a danger to children? All the man did was cry and feel bad about himself.\n\nYou need to stop judging people for their past, especially when the person has made the effort to move on and stay in a good place. \n\nAll you did was reveal you are a nasty person who tears others down and believes that some people are \"lessor\" and will always be lessor no matter how hard they make good.

You didn't think it was your responsibility to keep your family informed - - you wanted to let everyone know what you know, that you were the one he turned to.  He was feeling very vulnerable, and you were there to take advantage of it. Rather than thinking how incredibly difficult it was for him to turn his life around, you saw him in a worse, negative way.

Outside of being a gossip, I don't need to know that my family members are marrying folks who do sex work. That's not my business.", "Omg. You MUST be part of my family. Yta. Yta. Yta. Yta. \nOh. And did I say yta?", "And then read it again", "I got you.", "Does it really matter though? This is a throwaway account. I mean if you're asking, really asking if you are an AH, are you not trying to really figure it out?", "Nobody likes criticism, but take some time to cool it off and try to consider what's been said here. It costs nothing to be a better person.", "You\u2019d be surprised the number of \u201cput together\u201d ex addicts are walking around trying to live their best lives. They aren\u2019t walking around with a scarlet A to warn you to cross the street when you see them.", "This is tough. And not knowing exactly how long he\u2019s been clean makes it tougher, but it doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s been clean long enough that it wouldn\u2019t be a concern to hear about. \n\nNormally, I\u2019m of the opinion you shouldn\u2019t share other people\u2019s stories/medical info without their consent. But. Addiction is a scary disease that completely changes people.\n\nI understand you being worried and I can\u2019t bring myself to call you TA for wanting your family to be aware of this because like I said, I would want to know if I was the one inviting him over to my house.\n\nIt seems like you were in a tough spot, and I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s impacted your sisters relationship the way it has. Hopefully once everyone calms down from the initial shock/anger you can all sit down and talk about it. Maybe see if he has a sponsor who can be there for that conversation?", "See above response.", "\u2018I\u2019d want to know\u2019\u2026.I\u2019m not sure how much clearer I could be\u2026\n\n\u2018I would like to be made aware of\u2019\u2026.is that \nbetter?\n\nSomeone being a sex worker (and addict) tells you a lot about that person\u2019s character. Lol", "Treacherous, that is an excellent way to describe an addict. Thank you", "Good for you! Meanwhile I\u2019d like to know", "Why are you asking if you're an AH? When you seemed completely determined to tell everyone about your ex-FBIL. Is it just because your sister is not talking to you? And you're getting tendrils of guilt?", "Fair enough. I'm not saying it matters if people are unpleasant to me but it doesn't seem as though anyone is interested in considering my side. Maybe it's naive but I expected more balance in the responses. I find it hard to imagine none of these commenters would have any issue with a future family member being a recent IV heroin user and \"adult performer\". I'm not saying he's an evil person or that he doesn't deserve respect but that lifestyle does not have pleasant connotations for many reasons. Yes I feel bad for hurting him and for upsetting my sister. I would have found it extremely difficult to just pretend I didn't know and it changed how I view him.", "By treachery I mean betrayal. Breaking confidence with someone (even implied) is an act of betrayal.\n\nAttitudes like yours are one of the reasons why it can be so hard to recover from addiction. People often turn to substance abuse because there is something very wrong with their lives, and the drugs (a short-term balm, if that) generally exacerbate things. Then, once they've gotten in deep, addicts face another dilemma. Why work hard to stop and become a healthy, productive, respectable person if people are just going to treat you like a lost cause afterwards? The assumption that there is something immoral or broken about the people who become addicts makes it that much harder for them to change (and more likely to relapse if they manage it).\n\nFrom OPs post, it sounds like the addiction was in his past and he was just (understandably) emotional recalling that dark chapter of his life.\n\nWhat you're saying displays a startling lack of empathy and education when it comes to the topic of addiction.", "Yeah I'd like to know too lmao, I love to gossip. But ultimately it's none of my business, and OP is TA for spreading the information.", "I think most commenters have a problem with, not that you told your sister, somewhat that you told your husband, but that you told the rest of your family. Why would their life or livelihood be affected by his past?  \n\nIs the general length of time between telling your sister, and telling the rest of your family?", "You said it wasn't your intention that your actions would cause him to become ostracized from the family, but it's *exactly* what you wanted to happen.", ">I find it hard to imagine none of these commenters would have any issue with a future family member being a recent IV heroin user and \"adult performer\".\n\nI think a big part of why the reaction is so hostile is that you lump those things together when to most people the first one is potentially a legit concern while the second one should be a non-issue. If your sister doesn't care that he did sex work, why would you? How does it impact anyone else but her?", "Could it be the comments aren\u2019t balanced because you\u2019re unequivocally the asshole?", "Part of the best therapy for recovery and staying clean is having a supportive circle of friends and family, as well as staying integrated with normal healthy functioning adults. It's quite possible your judgmental mindset has pushed this man in a direction that will lead to using again.", "It\u2019s not that we aren\u2019t considering your position. We realize your position and that you responded by betraying a person\u2019s trust. You didn\u2019t respect someone\u2019s else privacy and that is why YTA.", "Your sister knew already. Being with him was her decision. She had NO issue with dude's past, so why should you? You were just looking to sow drama with this. You're a gossip, you're an instigator, you're EXTREMELY prejudiced, and you suck.", "The main issue is its not your place to tell others about his past. Sounds like you\u2019ve all enjoyed his company and like him until he confided in you. He saw you as someone he could trust and you violated that trust.  Your sister is 27, I\u2019m sure she checked that he doesn\u2019t have any communicable diseases from his past activities before deciding to marry him. So let\u2019s assume he doesn\u2019t have anything going on and he has his past addiction handled. You basically blew up his relationship, his support system and told everyone he cares about what he\u2019s most ashamed about. You don\u2019t see how you could have handled this better?", "You obviously don\u2019t think he deserves respect since you couldn\u2019t wait to tell his secrets. How does his past affect you in anyway? Name one way.", "What side? You were told something deeply personal and embarassing for your FBIL because he trusted you. How did you reward that trust? By asking your sister and then keeping your mouth shut as it's not your information to share? No, you told everyone, because you wanted them to know your sister made a bad choice and they should \"decide what kind of relationship they should have with him\".\n\nYou blew up his support network and ruined his chances of being happy with your sister, and now they've broken up.\n\nI hope you're satisfied.\n\nYour side isn't looking good enough to get a bunch of people on your side like you hoped.", "To each his own"]}
