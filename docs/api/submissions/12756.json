I have 2 younger siblings (28M and 27F) and my sister recently got engaged to FBIL (23M) after dating him for around a year. We all know him well and I have always got along with him. He comes from a rough background but he has always been very polite and charming. He doesn't talk about his own family or about his upbringing. My sister said it's a painful topic for him so no one ever pushed. \n\nThere was recently a family event which FBIL attended. He was quiet during the day (he is normally high-energy and sociable) then disappeared for a while. When I went outside for some fresh air I bumped into him. He was emotional and said it was a hard day for him due to negative associations. He ended up offloading some quite shocking things from his past including that he has a history of very serious drug use (including needles) and that he has done sex work and p\\*\\*n (men and women). I felt for him at the time because he was so upset (literally crying on my shoulder) but afterwards I felt more and more uncomfortable. I still feel bad for him since he clearly regrets it but it's very shocking to find out he has that kind of history and it does make me feel differently about him.   \n\nObviously I told my husband what FBIL told me because I didn't feel comfortable keeping it to myself. I also told my sister because I didn't know how honest he had been with her and it could impact on her decision to marry him. She was angry and said she was fully aware and it doesn't make her think less of him. I know others might disagree but I decided if my sister and FBIL weren't going to bring it up then it was my responsibility to make sure my family had the information they needed to make an informed choice about what kind of relationship they have with him. My parents agreed that it was the right thing to do and were grateful. My brother said he could see my point but didn't think it was my responsibility to share that information. My brother's wife thought I was out of line.   \n\nWhen my sister found out I told our family about FBIL's sketchy past, she was very angry. She is now refusing to speak to me altogether because apparently this has affected FBIL quite badly. They are no longer engaged because \"he thinks he's not good enough for her\" and no one in my family has seen him since all of this happened. Obviously that wasn't my intention and no one said \"he isn't good enough\". I think it's naive to pretend that you see someone exactly the same way after finding out they're an addict, whether you like it or not there are risks that come with that lifestyle and relapses are common. I'm concerned that my sister will get hurt and I don't think it's unreasonable for my family to have access to the same information I do, especially when they're inviting him to their homes and there are children around etc.   \n\nAITA for informing my family about FBIL's background?", "created_utc": 1679323338, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11wko7b/aita_for_exposing_my_future_bils_shady_past_to_my/", "score": 201, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He confided in you because he mistook you for a kind-hearted and good person who he could trust to comfort him and not judge him for a past he overcame and got himself out of, and you reacted by showing your true colors, and proving him wrong on every count. You judged him for having a rough past, ignoring the fact that overcoming it makes him stronger and more moral than you, who I\u2019m guessing by your pearl-clutching and judgmental attitude, has had an easier life with every advantage to not go down the paths he did. He struggled and fought to get to where he is today, and somehow you think that makes him lesser than you? It doesn\u2019t. And now you\u2019ve ruined your sister\u2019s relationship because are too narrow minded to know there is a difference between who he was, and who he is now.

You seem super judgey. None of those things have any affect on who he is as a person and there is no \u201cinformed decision\u201d that your parents need to make, nor is it any of your business. Have some empathy.", "YTA what did you think would happen when you humiliated him, that he would brush it off and carry on? Shameful.", "YTA\n\nIt wasn't your responsibility. It wasn't any kind of responsibility. \n\nBut you are a major asshole for deciding that the ex-FBIL is still an addict and somehow a lessor person for having done sex work. \n\nWTF is wrong with you? Addicts recover. They don't live that lifestyle when they are recovered. I don't think people should judge people who do sex work as lessor people, so I already think you are massive asshole for having that attitude. But you are an extra supreme asshole for judging your FBIL negatively for sex work that obviously tramatised him. It's highly likely he only did sex work out of desperation while he was in a bad way, as opposed to doing it for just regular work. You have the gall to judge him for that? And to out him? To pretend he's somehow a danger to children? All the man did was cry and feel bad about himself.\n\nYou need to stop judging people for their past, especially when the person has made the effort to move on and stay in a good place. \n\nAll you did was reveal you are a nasty person who tears others down and believes that some people are \"lessor\" and will always be lessor no matter how hard they make good.

You didn't think it was your responsibility to keep your family informed - - you wanted to let everyone know what you know, that you were the one he turned to.  He was feeling very vulnerable, and you were there to take advantage of it. Rather than thinking how incredibly difficult it was for him to turn his life around, you saw him in a worse, negative way.
