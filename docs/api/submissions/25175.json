On the day of the event, as we were setting up the food, people started arriving. Jennie and John arrived a bit late, but it didn't bother me as long as I got to see my sister. While I was having a conversation with her about her new job position, John kept talking over me and interrupting my sentences.

I agreed, and she went to chat with some friends. That's when I overheard John making a derogatory comment about girls wearing crop tops, saying they shouldn't because it doesn't look right and is unappealing. It bothered me immensely, so I couldn't help but confront him. I said, 'John, I know you're not talking, considering your big fat ass broke my pool float when you jumped on it at my pool party last year. How can you criticize her weight when you're like 300 pounds? That's some insecure shit right there, and you're just projecting. Damn, that's crazy. Grow the hell up, John.' Then I walked out and threw away my plate.\n\n  \nWhen I returned, Maggie and John were nowhere to be found, and most people had already left. I took it upon myself to clean up. Later, Maggie texted my mom about what I said. My mom thinks I'm the one in the wrong and I should apologize to John , but Jennie disagrees and thanks me for sticking up for her.
