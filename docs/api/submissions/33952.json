I asked him if he knew where all of my food went to and he said \"yeah, I ate it, I got hungry.\" I then got upset and went over to the couch where he was sitting and found wrappers, empty boxes, bags empty, and him staring at me. I started screaming, asking him if he knew how expensive my food was because I have to eat with accommodations and how I didn't have much left to eat to begin with. he then replied with \"can't you just order take out?\" I got so upset that I packed my things and told him to leave and go home.\n\n\n\nin conclusion, AITA", "created_utc": 1703811594, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18t9yf0/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_to_leave_my_house/", "score": 1866, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You thinking screaming at him is ok? I fully understand being upset and annoyed, but screaming?!

You said he \u201ceats like a pig\u201d, clearly he doesn\u2019t have restraint or know what moderation is. It sounds like he\u2019s still struggling and NOT in control right now.

Disregarding your dietary restrictions and treating your belongings with a lack of respect are not qualities that should be tolerated in a partner.

It's possible that there are positive aspects to your partnership, but it's hard to ignore the glaring issues that have surfaced recently.

Have you had issues with food and him before this?", "NTA \n\nNo considerate person goes through another person's cupboard and eats whatever they like without checking with their host. If they did mistakenly eat something they shouldn't, they would immediately appologize, feel horrible, and make amends. It doesn't speak well of his suitability as a long-term partner. In my experience, people who show casual lack of consideration for the perspective or needs of their partner don't experience personal growth that ever changes that inherent selfish streak. I wouldn't waste time on him.", "This is a breakup level of stupidity and lack of empathy in his part.

Sometimes people are still wondering why: 'he could have eaten this or this but he chose to eat the specific things I can eat' or try to to find rational reasons 'he prefers this flavor, that's why'. This is not a mistake. He was testing how submissive she is. This is a major red flag.", "She conveniently left out that she only had 2 snack bars, half a salad, and some cheese it\u2019s. Yes, she needs to clarify what she had on hand and if she actually told him about it.", "Sounds like you\u2019ve never experienced food insecurity before.", "Do you say things like that to people's faces?", "To be fair to him: all of the food he ate was ready-to-go simple stuff.  It\u2019s exactly the kind of food I\u2019d imagine going for if I had a compulsion to eat right away.\n\nI think he\u2019s TA, but I\u2019m not sure we can conclude that this was a targeted thing where he was deliberately trying to eat all of and only her food, especially if it was stored together.", "Sorry I\u2019m not sure how to point you to another comment but if you click on OP\u2019s profile, there is a comment that says \u201cyes he does, we have been dating for a year and a half\u201d which if you check is in reply to somebody asking for this info", "I thought that was in answer to \"Does he know you have allergies\", not \"Does he know which food is free game for him\".\n\nNot all allergies are obvious, like not eating peanutbutter for peanut allergies. Some are odd and uncommon and \"safe\" foods can seemingly have no clear commonality between them.\n\nI knew a guy who was deathly allergic to tree nuts, but could eat peanutbutter by the jar. He also couldn't eat Doritos for some unknown reason he could never figure out.\n\nThat's why I asked in my earlier comment whether the food separation was obvious or implied.", "I think if I was in a relationship with somebody for over a year and knew their allergies I would know what food they had that was safe for them to eat. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s expecting too much of somebodies intelligence. Or asking too much of their kindness to check they could eat said safe foods"]}
