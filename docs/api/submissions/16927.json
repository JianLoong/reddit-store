Hopefully your parents hold the line here and don't give in your silly sense of entitlement.", "First of all, for just asking I don't think that makes YTA.  \n\nHowever from the story, them paying for your sisters first marriage doesn't count because it seems like a marriage that THEY wanted when they tried to force her to be straight.  Now they're paying for the marriage SHE wants.  So technically they're only paying for one wedding for your sister...the other was for them.\n\nIf you are going to still complain and mope and be a pain about it after they say no, then yes, YWBTA.  If you realize this though and accept their decision not to pay for your renewal, then you're NTA.", "YTA. First off, it\u2019s my husband\u2019s and *my* vow renewal, not I\u2019s. Never that. And secondly, yes you are an AH for demanding a vow renewal party. Did you even want one before they offered to pay for your sister\u2019s wedding? Or was that your spur of the moment way of \u201cmaking it fair?\u201d Because it\u2019s unnecessary and entitled.", "Massive YTA. Why are you so entitled to money that has nothing to do with you? Your parents are trying to fix their mistakes, you should be proud of how far they\u2019ve come. And you should consider yourself lucky that you \u201conly\u201d have 1 wedding and marriage. Jeez", "YTA. It\u2019s cute that you think YOU, As a grown human are throwing a tantrum bc your parents won\u2019t spend THEIR money on YOU? \ud83d\ude02", ">I believe this insistence is largely a way for them to try to make up to my sister how they handled her sexuality in the past.\n\nGood! I\u2019m glad they were given the opportunity and happily obliged. \n\nYTA. \nMy first thought after reading the title was maybe you had to pay for your own wedding and then your younger sister had hers covered by your parents. That is obviously not the case lol. Don\u2019t let entitlement & resentment, aimed towards a non-existent issue, create a wedge in your relationship with your parents AND your sister.", "YTA. Believe it or not, you just seem jealous that they were excited and offered it to her. You are already a worse person than her because you a) asked your parents for it and b) feel entitled to that money. \n\nAlso, it is not your business if they feel like they owe it to her. You should be thankful you have had one marriage, didn\u2019t have to face coming out or conversion camp, and are getting ready for a vow renewal. I\u2019m sure your sister would have loved to have it that easy.", "Just get a divorce then marry the same man again after few months... \n\nNTA", "What is the point of vow renewals? It\u2019s like a wedding 2.0.  Just go on a vacation together.", "YTA. Get a divorce and get remarried if you want another wedding that badly. I'll never understand people who are happy with what they have until someone else gets slightly more.", "Parents: we wronged daughter1, now we wanna make up for it.\n\nDaughter2: now you wronged me, gief moni pls.\n\nDid you ask for gifts when it was someone else\u2019s birthday, too? YTA lol not everything is about you.", "Divorce your partner and find another one. Simple. You will have a second wedding and then this will be an actual issue. Vow renewal is not a wedding. YTA.", "I mean technically you are right in feeling shorted on free party's but the entitlement is astounding. I'm 40 years old and my parents wouldn't buy me dinner. Seriously if we go out to eat they say separate checks immediately. How do y'all get your parents to do these things? YTA but because you feel like you deserve or are owed a 2nd party.  Why not be happy your parents are trying to fix their wrongs? Why try to get something out of it?  Be an adult. Use your inheritance to pay for your renewal.", "OP, you're 37 years old. In this case I think leach is a better choice of words than asshole.", "YTA\n\nSeriously? Do you want to make sure the Will is even too? Grow up", "YTA and way entitled.", "YTA. I\u2019ve got a better idea. Why not divorce your husband and find a new one, and then *maybe* your parents might pay for that second wedding. Cheers!", "YTA. your parents money is not your money and they can it spend it how they choose. your sister had a difficult time and has found a new partner, that\u2019s worth the celebration.\n\nyou are a middle aged woman sulking because your elderly parents won\u2019t throw you a party too? do you whine when you say it? I bet you do.\n\ngrow up, get ahold of yourself, stop being a jealous monster.", "YTA. You are ridiculous, entitled and selfish. Glad that you and your husband married each other so that two other people could be spared.", "While I can understand how you see the disparity and this has to do with your parents guilt there are some things you just need to let go. \n\nI\u2019m not going to say your the A because again\u2026feelings but don\u2019t choose to die on this hill.", "YTA\n\nMy gosh, did you count the number of potato chips your mother put on your respective plates at cookouts? \n\nYour parents are trying to make up for past sins against your sister. Let them, and stop being greedy.", "YTA. I understand the jealousy between siblings and feeling that way isn\u2019t necessarily unreasonable. You can\u2019t control feelings, but you can control how you act on them. You need to take a step back and see how ridiculous you\u2019re being. Seek therapy.", "Good for your parents and your sister. Stop being so petty.", "Both of you are grown a** women. Pay for your own lives. You sound like you\u2019re 5 with the keeping score and making things \u201ceven.\u201d Be careful what you wish for.", "YTA, you are way too old to be doing this make it even nonsense. Your parents\u2019 gesture to your sister is to try to heal a wound they dealt her, it\u2019s not a party for a party\u2019s sake. Stop counting other peoples\u2019 money. Maybe try being happy for your sister instead of trying to figure out how you can get yours.", "Why not just ask for a check for the amount you think you are owed? YTA.", "INFO: Were you already planning a vow renewal before, or did you just decide you needed one once your sister\u2019s second wedding was getting paid for?", "YTA you\u2019re so bratty.", "What? Hahahahaha. YTA", "YTA. Your sister is getting a second chance at love. You're just confirming that you found it already.", "Tell you what. If you want to make it even, you have to go to a camp where they try and brainwash you into denying your innate sexuality, live a lie for years out of guilt, then divorce your husband and marry a woman. Then it\u2019ll be fair.\n\nJesus fuck, absolutely YTA. Self reflection.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what *exactly* your issue is, but you should be in therapy for it 100%", "YTA, how the fuck is this about you? Go be happy for your sister and commend your parents on trying to be better and do right by your sister.", "37 and you are this entitled. Yikes. YTA. Grow up, they owe you nothing and you are acting incredibly selfish.", "YTA. \nI didn't read your story, but only AH waste time and money on vow renewals.", "YTA. \nI suggest you learn more about what it is like to come out and have your family try to convert you to being straight. \nGet the fuck over yourself. If you wanna have a big party, throw it yourself. This has literally NOTHING to do with you.", "YTA if this were just about money spent on each kid, I'd say sure, keep it pretty even.  But this is an attempt to make amends for sending her to conversion therapy and doing who knows what damage during her childhood.  I'd highly suggest you just back off and let them do this, and be thankful you were never put through what she was.\n\nPlus they still paid for your actual wedding, right?  Quit being so greedy and entitled.", "You are a f\u2019n adult. Act accordingly. Your parents no longer owe you anything. They can spend their money as they wish. Waaaahhh, sis got something and I didn\u2019t\u2026..grow up, you entitled brat. Oh, btw\u2026YTA", "YTA. What's wrong with you?", "YTA", "YTA.  Your parents' money is not your money and they can spend it however they want.", "YTA. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair that they paid for two of hers and one of mine\u201d \u201cmake it even\u201d. What are you, 8??", "You are 37. And you just want something for the heck of it because your sister is getting it? She's not getting a present, it's not a handout, it's an apology for how they treated her. You are 37 geez, people mostly stop doing this in late teenage. YTA, don't make it about you.\n\nIf your resentment is because they can afford it so why are they getting it, the problem lies elsewhere. It becomes less about your parents doing something for them and more about them being able to afford more than you. Everyone has their own paths. Don't belittle your achievements by comparing them to your sister's and fall in to the traps of petty jealousy.", "At least OP is showing her ownership over her parent\u2019s money now vs on their death bed. Plenty of time to change the will", "A vow renewal event at age 37 screams \u201ctrouble in paradise\u201d to me", "Oh jeez I made the mistake of reading their ages and rolling my eyes at \u201cparents paying for wedding\u201d. Mea culpa, OP\u2019s sister.", "Like, yeah, the parents are probably paying for the wedding to make up for the conversion camp, *as they should*. They massively fucked up and will probably be trying to deal with that for the rest of their lives, and OP is like \"well, it isn't *fair* that my sister gets more money than me just because our parents locked her up for a bit!\"", "Yes, if the parents hadn't interfered and forced their daughter to conform, this would be her first wedding.", "It sounds like a really important gesture. If they were sending their child to conversion therapy 20 years ago, they would still have connections to a community that is very anti-gay. So throwing a wedding for their gay daughter is a really strong move. \n\nOP, on the other hand - where's the gesture? \"We also support long-term heterosexual relationships.\" Yeah, everyone knew that already.", "I feel like op was pretty obviously the golden child her entire life and they all three bullied the sister. so the parents working toward a relationship with her sister is literally the dissolution of that bond. She\u2019s practically begging her parents to show they still favor her the most because if she\u2019s not special to them then\u2026. Maybe she never was the main character at all\u2026.. \ud83c\udfbb", "Did you mean to say YTA?", "Who exactly is the asshole in this situation then?", "And the situations are always complicated. \n\nLike, look, when we force you into some sort of abusive therapy program and convince you that you are hell-bound because of who you love and then you finally find your life partner, we\u2019ll *also* pay for your second wedding. And I\u2019m super sorry that *all* you got was a normal childhood and no trauma surrounding your sexuality and you never feared for your safety or doubted our love and acceptance. Obviously that was the short end of the stick compared to having just one day where you feel accepted and your love is celebrated. You\u2019ll never know the feeling of having your parents pay a fraction of what the therapy bills have cost in order to try to make up for being bigoted. We\u2019re so sorry to have denied you, for once, in favor of your sister. Please forgive us.", "Well said! The poor sister probably only married the first time, because she was forced to be someone she wasn't, which is most likely why the marriage didn't last. Now she's finally able to be who she wants to be, and marry someone she truly loves. But OP is crying pour me instead... Wow! It blows my mind how selfish some people are.", "Alarmed jellyfish,  well said. \ud83d\udc4d", "Yep total YTA", "No OP was just putting a price tag on her sister's happiness and their parents' attempt to right a cruel wrong. Classic sibling nonsense, \" why does she get to sit in the front seat\" baloney.", "Hopefully, this is a good reminder to the parents to make that will ironclad because OP will be making that time much more painful than it already is", "OP can\u2019t stand to not be in the spotlight", "I know I can\u2019t believe she isn\u2019t saving that opportunity for her inevitable second wedding around the corner.", "Maybe when she divorces this guy, OP's parents can contribute to her next wedding. \n\nYou want a second wedding, get a second husband.", "Agree this is a stellar observation.", "Nope.", "Exactly! Absolutely infuriating that OP is throwing a tantrum and trying to make it about her. I also feel like this vow renewal thing was just made up on the spot because she's mad things aren't going to be about her with her sister's upcoming wedding.\n\nAnd all this BS about it not being equal? Things were never equal for them growing up, is OP going to volunteer to be tortured at some BS camp and spend a large portion of her life pretending to be someone she's not just to appease her parents?\n\nOP clearly got used to being favored by her parents as a child because she sure is one spoiled, bratty asshole. And a terrible sister to boot.", "\"I want a gift at my sibling's birthday\" energy", "I'm genuinely curious, you mentioned how ridiculous this is. So who do you think is the asshole here?", "No one. Unless she keeps beating a dead horse"]}
