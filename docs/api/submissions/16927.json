If my parents wanted to just give my sister a $10,000 check out of the blue, I would absolutely have no right to he upset or question them because bottom line, how they spend their money is not my business. Even when we were kids they had the philosophy that equal doesn\u2019t mean same in terms treatment and finances. Sometimes one of our needs or hobbies costed more than the other sibling but that didn\u2019t mean my parents were being unfair. Just as an example my sister did cheer in HS and I wrestled. My sister\u2019s uniform alone was probably double what my parents spent on my wrestling equipment. Would it have been right of me to demand they give me money because they spent more on my sister\u2019s sport? In adulthood, my parents covered my rent while I finished my teaching program so I wouldn\u2019t have to work in addition to 40 plus hours a week I was spending in the classroom and finishing school. Would it have been fair for my sister to demand that my parents cover her rent even though she was able to get a job and an apartment right after undergrad? Granted, my parents were in no way obligated to help me either but I tend to find that most parents that have the means to help make their kids\u2019 life easier or just more enjoyable, will do what they can. Your parents see an opportunity to do this for your sister by paying for her wedding. I\u2019m sure if you really think about it, you\u2019d recall that your parents have done things or paid for things for you that they didn\u2019t for your sister, because it\u2019s something you specifically wanted or needed at the time.

You are way, way, way too old to be whining about things not being fair. But let\u2019s expand on that anyways. I think it\u2019s not fair that when you expressed interest in men you\u2019re parents didn\u2019t take you to conversion therapy to try to force you to become a lesbian. I think it\u2019s not fair your relationship was immediately accepted, and you weren\u2019t shamed and treated like a shameful sinner for being who you are. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that you haven\u2019t gotten divorced. So here\u2019s how to make it fair: face discrimination and be unsupported by your family and loved ones. Be afraid to tell people who you are because it could get you killed. Be sent to be abused into being lesbian. Get divorced and find a new husband. Then listen to your fully grown sister whine because it\u2019s not \u201cfair\u201d that your parents are paying for your second wedding to make up for their mistreatment and her demand they pay for a second ceremony for her and her husband. That\u2019s fair. You don\u2019t want fair. You want to be favored and put first at all times and are throwing a fit because it\u2019s not about you and you seem to think your parents owe it to you to never do anything for her they don\u2019t for you, even though you never had to be mistreated by them either. I\u2019m sure in your head you are the reasonable facing what seems to be your incredibly privileged take on injustice, but to everyone else in world you sound like the spoiled brat no one wanted to invite to their birthday party because they tried to open the birthday kid\u2019s presents and blew out the candles because they wanted the party to be about them even though it wasn\u2019t their birthday party.", "I don't understand this whole \"make it even\" mentality.  My sis and bro struggle to support themselves, and while I'm not well off, I can support myself.

First, without knowing exactly what experience your sister went through in conversion therapy, it is universally a very traumatizing experience accompanied by years of repression, micro aggressions, and hate from the outside world, likely including your parents.

This time is unequivocally about your sister and trying to shift the focus to yourself is selfish. Second, and this is just my personal opinion on vow renewals, you are choosing to embark on a completely optional and somewhat frivolous step in your marriage.

I don\u2019t know you or your life, and it\u2019s not about the trauma olympics and who deserves more. What I do know is that your sister is taking an important step in her life and your parents are helping with that step because they were not supportive of her in the past. You are taking a step which may be important in your relationship, but is based on your choice to introduce this new step and is not marred by your parents not supporting a significant part of your identity in the past (to my knowledge).\n\nAlso, if you feel like your relationship with your parents is unbalanced with your sister\u2019s, this is a great thing to explore in individual or family therapy if that is accessible to you.
