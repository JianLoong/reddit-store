If my parents wanted to just give my sister a $10,000 check out of the blue, I would absolutely have no right to he upset or question them because bottom line, how they spend their money is not my business. Even when we were kids they had the philosophy that equal doesn\u2019t mean same in terms treatment and finances. Sometimes one of our needs or hobbies costed more than the other sibling but that didn\u2019t mean my parents were being unfair. Just as an example my sister did cheer in HS and I wrestled. My sister\u2019s uniform alone was probably double what my parents spent on my wrestling equipment. Would it have been right of me to demand they give me money because they spent more on my sister\u2019s sport? In adulthood, my parents covered my rent while I finished my teaching program so I wouldn\u2019t have to work in addition to 40 plus hours a week I was spending in the classroom and finishing school. Would it have been fair for my sister to demand that my parents cover her rent even though she was able to get a job and an apartment right after undergrad? Granted, my parents were in no way obligated to help me either but I tend to find that most parents that have the means to help make their kids\u2019 life easier or just more enjoyable, will do what they can.

I think it\u2019s not fair that when you expressed interest in men you\u2019re parents didn\u2019t take you to conversion therapy to try to force you to become a lesbian. I think it\u2019s not fair your relationship was immediately accepted, and you weren\u2019t shamed and treated like a shameful sinner for being who you are. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that you haven\u2019t gotten divorced. So here\u2019s how to make it fair: face discrimination and be unsupported by your family and loved ones. Be afraid to tell people who you are because it could get you killed. Be sent to be abused into being lesbian. Get divorced and find a new husband. Then listen to your fully grown sister whine because it\u2019s not \u201cfair\u201d that your parents are paying for your second wedding to make up for their mistreatment and her demand they pay for a second ceremony for her and her husband. That\u2019s fair. You don\u2019t want fair. You want to be favored and put first at all times and are throwing a fit because it\u2019s not about you and you seem to think your parents owe it to you to never do anything for her they don\u2019t for you, even though you never had to be mistreated by them either. I\u2019m sure in your head you are the reasonable facing what seems to be your incredibly privileged take on injustice, but to everyone else in world you sound like the spoiled brat no one wanted to invite to their birthday party because they tried to open the birthday kid\u2019s presents and blew out the candles because they wanted the party to be about them even though it wasn\u2019t their birthday party.", "I don't understand this whole \"make it even\" mentality.  My sis and bro struggle to support themselves, and while I'm not well off, I can support myself.

Why would you pay someone to do that?", "You are an AH: vow of renewal is a thing you choose to do.. you can do it once, every 20 years, or every 20 minutes. A wedding is different: it\u2019s a commitment that has also legal ramifications. From the philosophical pov, two became one. You\u2019re already married to your husband, but want to also spend your parents\u2019 $$, because you\u2019d consider that to be fair? It\u2019s not, it\u2019s childish.", "YTA. To make things truly even, you must first endure the same trauma she experienced at the hands of your parents.", "Both of you should've quit asking your parents for money period once you left home what are you 15  years old for FS?", "Your parents do not owe you THEIR money, they are doing a kind gesture and you are not entitled to the same treatment for the sake of \"making things even\".", "The unfair part is that they only paid for her conversion therapy and not yours. Oh, you're not complaining about that because it's literally psychological torture and often also physically abusive? Then shut up. You want to benefit from your privilege while complaining about them attempting to make amends for a horrific thing they did to her. YTA.", "YTA and a whole grown adult with a child like jealousy. It's unattractive, stop it.\n\nYou KNOW your sister was bullied and mistreated by your parents and this is part of their attempt to make it up to her.\n\nWTF kind of adult, at nearly 40 years of age, asks their parents to pay for something to make things \"fair\"?!", "YTA. Let\u2019s compare apples to apples. Divorce your husband and get married to someone else and I am sure they will give you another wedding. People like you make me feel so glad that I am an only child. Petty, simply petty.", "YTA. I don't understand this tit-for-tat mindset. So when your parents are spending, for the moment, more money on your sister than you, you feel left out? This is entitled while trying to take advantage of your parents.", "Jesus, act like a grown adult. YTA.", "I\u2019m surprised I had to scroll this far to come to this fact being pointed out. \n\nYour sister was \u201cforcibly converted\u201d into being straight\u2026. How much money would your sister cough up to not have experienced that? \n\nMy bet is more than the cost of a wedding or 5. \n\nYTA", "This. It\u2019s blood money, OP. Get over yourself and consider yourself lucky that you get to marry the love of your life without being shamed by your family that you\u2019ll go to hell for loving them.", "OP talks about it like its a normal byproduct of life. OP might have been happy when sister was sent away.", "Also it sounds like the parents were huge assholes about sister being a lesbian. I\u2019m sure the sister would much rather have had her parents accept her at the start than get a wedding paid for later. I know I would.", "OP is an asshole, but to be fair, you can't say this one is real and that one was fake.  This one could be fake too.  We don't know enough to make that judgment. Check back in 5 years.", "It\u2019s pathological", "I\u2019d say not just any child, but a simple-minded, self-centered child at that. If my mother took us all to the doctor\u2019s as kids, and only one of us got an injection, for example, only that child was given a lollipop. We didn\u2019t make a fuss about it. Only brother had the needle in his arm, so only brother gets the treat, which doesn\u2019t completely make up for the jab, but at least makes it sting a bit less. Not that hard to understand, even for a child.", "i\u2019m sad for you. your parents won\u2019t even buy you dinner ? that\u2019s cold. that\u2019s literally like bare minimum once you\u2019re grown and moved out.", "YTA.\nYour parents paying for her wedding but not your vow renewal might make things even between you and your sister.", "A vow renewal is nothing but a vanity project (saying this as someone who has renewed her vows). You just feel entitled to a \"wedding\" because your sister is getting one.\nWah.", "If feel like a wov renewal is a public announcement of one of us cheated. Now we have to commit again because that will make the issues evaporate.", "It kind of bugs me how people are making vow renewals bugger and bigger and trying to make them seem as important as a wedding.\n\nI know some people who have done a vow renewal every year on their wedding anniversary and use at as a means to recommit themselves to their relationship but it is only the couple and maybe a few others. But so many more people are doing massive ceremonies and spending tens of thousands, and expecting their entire families to join them. It just seems completely ridiculous.\n\nI got divorced a few years back, and I've always said that if I get remarried, I just want to do a basic court marriage and maybe a small celebration at home with close family members instead of wasting my money again. In my eyes you get married and spend the money once. Although OP's sister is a very different case altogether", "Look I love a good bandwagon as much as the next one but my parents had a whole second wedding when they were past 40 because the first time they just capitulated to their parents demands and hated it. \n\nI was there for the second one, it was an awesome time. \n\nI definitely agree that OP is TA in this situation but they could just be doing something similar. Or maybe they\u2019re just a little corny.", "I\u2019m wondering if they have joint social media pages too\u2026because they just love each oh so much!", "Historically it\u2019s a death nail \n\nI rarely see vow renewals that don\u2019t end in divorce a year or two later", "You can do a very large party for much less than the cost of a wedding of the same size. A lot of vendors upcharge for weddings.\n\nOne thing to consider about large parties is, if your family doesn't all live in the same place and see each other often, they may be the only time you really get everyone together. When my mother was 60, 65, and 70, her husband was 10 years older and her mother was 25 years older They did 215, 230, and 245 birthday parties. The parties were expensive, but my mother could afford it and loved big shindig's like that. But the thing was that her cousins and her aunts and uncles, and her friends from college that she was still in touch with all came from states away to celebrate with her. (My stepfather has family and war buddies and college friends who attended as well.)\n\nMy stepmother stepfather and grandmother are dead now, and so are those aunts and uncles and friends and most of the cousins. My sister eloped, and I never married, so we never got to have a big wedding where everyone would come and dance and eat and have fun. I do see it as a loss.\n\nI don't regret never finding a partner, but I do regret never having the opportunity to dance with my father and my grandfather at my wedding.", "just to be happy for someone and not look at every little thing like a competition.", "Your parents should feel shitty for sending your sister to conversion therapy and essentially guilting her into a first marriage with someone she didnt love."]}
