I sputtered something like, \u201cBut I thought you were getting married with grandma\u2019s ring?\u201d\n\nAmy just smiled and said, \u201cYeah, it is grandma\u2019s ring!\u201d She explained that for her wedding gift, she asked John to \u201cupgrade\u201d the ring into this monstrosity since he didn\u2019t have to pay for an engagement ring in the first place. One of the diamonds was grandma\u2019s and then the white gold melted down to make one of her wedding bands but the rest was all new stuff. \n\nI burst into tears, I was so shocked and hurt. I told her she destroyed our grandparents\u2019 heirloom. If she wanted a giant diamond to wear every day that\u2019s her choice but the ring was important to our family.

I found Grandma and asked her if she knew what Amy had done. Amy\u2019s mom had told her that Amy had to have it resized and have the setting fixed but Grandma had NO IDEA that it was made into an entirely new ring. She didn\u2019t say anything but I could tell she was upset. \n\nThe wedding went on but everyone could tell that there was some awkwardness between me and Amy and Jane and Grandma is refusing to talk about the matter. Amy is saying I owe her an apology. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong for saying she destroyed a family heirloom. Plus the fact that she didn\u2019t tell anyone what she was doing and misled Grandma says to me she knew she was wrong or at least it wouldn\u2019t have been condoned. I feel like she saw it not as an heirloom but a way to subsidize what she really wanted.\n\nI know the mature thing to do is just get over it and accept that it was given to Amy and she made her choice but I\u2019m finding it really hard to get over what she did.

Yes it\u2019s tasteless to melt down an old family ring, but it\u2019s also bad to cause a scene about it on her wedding day.", "To be fair, you are not wrong for feelings these things, like Jane said can\u2019t change it now, it\u2019s already fucked up. But you did let your emotions run that day. Your cousins day. Her wedding day. A gift is given, afterwards you can\u2019t say what someone does with it. It\u2019s an heirloom yes would it have gone to you? Never, so no it was not fair from you to rain on her parade and hot go tattle to grandma\u2026", "YTA. First of all the ring was a gift. While it would have been nice for her to keep it intact she was under no obligation to do so. \n\nSecondly - you started an argument with her in her wedding day and then decided that was a good time to drag your grandmother into it. You couldn\u2019t have waited until after the wedding to interfere, you had to do it during the wedding. Not cool", "ESH - ugh I\u2019ve never known anyone where this Tradition worked out for. Everyone sucks. You suck most because you brought this up and created insane drama on her wedding day. Not okay. Your grandma kinda sucks because she probably should have been more careful about Who she gave it to. She gave it to the person who cared least which tells me she didn\u2019t put a lot of effort into thinking about who would really love it. I don\u2019t think Amy should have done it without telling your grandma However, none of that is your business. Amy deserves her own ring. Every woman does. Including your grandma. Each bride deserves a symbol of love that is unique to her relationship so I understand Amy wanting to make it hers but this is a shining example of why sometimes these traditions don\u2019t work. Everyone is upset. You, Amy, Grandma, Jane. Which could have been avoided by having your grandma keep Her ring to remember Her love story and everyone else getting Their own rings to remember Their love story.", "You ask your question in two different ways in your post, and I think my answer would be different for each.\n\nYou are N-T-A for feeling the way you do. Your feelings about this are understandable.\nBut I think YTA for what you did with those feelings. \nMaybe you couldn\u2019t control your initial reaction, but then you tried to drag your Grandma into this fight on your cousin\u2019s wedding day. At that point nothing could be done, you didn\u2019t need to try and sour the day for more people.", "ESH \nWhile your reaction in the heat of the moment is understandable, going out of your way to find your grandmother and tell her this mid-wedding really comes across as sabotage. Jane had the right idea here, because instead of your grandmother noticing on her own, you've put yourself in the middle of a conflict that isn't your business. \n\nAs for your cousin, while it is technically correct that a person can do whatever they want with a gift, basic decency still applies. Not having the courage to say \"grandmother, thank you for the ring, I am going to use it for parts\", is a situation of your cousin's own making.", "I would say NTA if the ring was willed to/rightfully yours, because it is shitty what Amy did to the ring. However, it was gifted to her since she\u2019s higher up the inheritance food chain, and as it\u2019s her possession she has every right to do with it as she pleases, for better or for worse. Although she should\u2019ve at least gotten feedback from Grandma first. YTA.", "YTA. I definitely understand that you had feelings about that ring, and the disappointment that it went to someone who didn't value it the way you did is real. \n\n\nBut.\n\n\nOnce a gift is given, it belongs to the recipient. It was never your ring, and it was no longer your grandmother's either.", "YTA. It's not yours and it obviously wasn't to your cousin's taste. Also, it's not like it's something that was handed down over hundreds of years. If you like it so much, go get one made.", "ESH\n\nAmy and her mom are AHs because they clearly knew Grandma would be upset about what she did with the ring and that's why they chose not to tell her.  And in addition to not asking they were just letting her be confronted by it on the day of. In addition if Amy didn't love the setting it would have made way more sense for her to keep the diamond and gift the setting.  But whatever. \n\nYou are NTA for bursting into tears upon finding out, but at that point you should have forking excused yourself from the room to cry. Later on you paste on a smile and you let her get through the day.  Instead you confronted a bride on HER WEDDING DAY about something no one can change now and that makes you a massive AH.", "I could understand having something separated to be re-set, but not utterly destroyed like that, that's horrific", "ESH, You're an AH because you told grandma about it during the wedding day", "With the caveat that I wasn\u2019t there when it happened and only heard about it after, Grandma offered the ring to John but didn\u2019t pressure him into taking it. She told him he didn\u2019t have to take it if he didn\u2019t think Amy would want it, so the implication was that she was offering the ring as is, and there would be no hard feelings if they didn\u2019t take it. Jane also told me that Grandma offered her the ring after she and her wife eloped but Jane turned it down because she and her wife didn\u2019t do engagement rings and at the time she thought either Amy or me would want it as an engagement ring. So no, Grandma didn\u2019t say \u201cyou have to keep it this way\u201d but now I know that she never imagined that any of us would basically use it for parts."]}
