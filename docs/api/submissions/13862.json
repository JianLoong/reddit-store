It\u2019s an heirloom yes would it have gone to you? Never, so no it was not fair from you to rain on her parade and hot go tattle to grandma\u2026", "YTA. First of all the ring was a gift. While it would have been nice for her to keep it intact she was under no obligation to do so. \n\nSecondly - you started an argument with her in her wedding day and then decided that was a good time to drag your grandmother into it.

At that point nothing could be done, you didn\u2019t need to try and sour the day for more people.", "ESH \nWhile your reaction in the heat of the moment is understandable, going out of your way to find your grandmother and tell her this mid-wedding really comes across as sabotage. Jane had the right idea here, because instead of your grandmother noticing on her own, you've put yourself in the middle of a conflict that isn't your business. \n\nAs for your cousin, while it is technically correct that a person can do whatever they want with a gift, basic decency still applies. Not having the courage to say \"grandmother, thank you for the ring, I am going to use it for parts\", is a situation of your cousin's own making.", "I would say NTA if the ring was willed to/rightfully yours, because it is shitty what Amy did to the ring.

And in addition to not asking they were just letting her be confronted by it on the day of. In addition if Amy didn't love the setting it would have made way more sense for her to keep the diamond and gift the setting.  But whatever. \n\nYou are NTA for bursting into tears upon finding out, but at that point you should have forking excused yourself from the room to cry. Later on you paste on a smile and you let her get through the day.  Instead you confronted a bride on HER WEDDING DAY about something no one can change now and that makes you a massive AH.", "I could understand having something separated to be re-set, but not utterly destroyed like that, that's horrific", "ESH, You're an AH because you told grandma about it during the wedding day", "With the caveat that I wasn\u2019t there when it happened and only heard about it after, Grandma offered the ring to John but didn\u2019t pressure him into taking it. She told him he didn\u2019t have to take it if he didn\u2019t think Amy would want it, so the implication was that she was offering the ring as is, and there would be no hard feelings if they didn\u2019t take it. Jane also told me that Grandma offered her the ring after she and her wife eloped but Jane turned it down because she and her wife didn\u2019t do engagement rings and at the time she thought either Amy or me would want it as an engagement ring. So no, Grandma didn\u2019t say \u201cyou have to keep it this way\u201d but now I know that she never imagined that any of us would basically use it for parts.", "NTA.

That said, there's nothing you can do about it.  I'd talk to her calmly tell her how YOU feel.  Don't blame her or tell her what she should've done, explain how her actions made you feel and what that ring meant to you.  I personally think that a ring, no matter how sentimentally valuable, is not worth losing a good relationship with your cousin.

This is heartbreaking and I am sad for you and your grandmother, OP. \n\nThis whole story is giving me major 27 Dresses vibes and making me crave that level of petty revenge. Immature, I know, but so is destroying a cherished gift like a ring or gown simply for the piecesparts. \n\nOP, I wish I had good advice to help you get over this but I don't have any. Hug your grandmother extra tight though. She likely could use it.", "NTA for your emotional reaction. Maybe telling Grandma at the wedding was a bit uncalled for, but you were feeling hurt, betrayed and angry so it's unsurprising you weren't completely rational. I think it would have been better to make Amy tell Grandma what she did to the ring (not at the wedding, however).\n\nJane has the right attitude - while what Amy did was upsetting, there's nothing to be done now and technically the ring does belong to her, so while it was unfeeling and self-centred, Amy didn't ethically do wrong. You're also right about how Amy viewed the ring, but again - not your ring.", "After reading so many things about heirlooms I'm just happy I don't have any.", "NTA. There\u2019s some good suggestions in the thread about getting another ring made based on pics of the original that might help both you and your grandma feel better. You\u2019re right, Amy was dishonest in her approach and you don\u2019t owe her an apology for calling her out or being upset. She didn\u2019t want the ring and she should have said so. Gutting it for parts is the accurate description of what she did, and you\u2019re correct in that she (and her mom) lied about it to cover what her actual aims were for an heirloom.", "NTA for your emotions, it's a shitty and selfish thing she did.", "NTA I have an heirloom ring. It\u2019s not my style, but I love it and would never touch it. (Other than to resize it.)", "NTA! It was a family heirloom. Amy and John should have asked Grandma permission first before making any changes to the ring. Your reaction to the news is understandable.", "NTA completely understandable reaction.", "NTA and you don't owe her an apology for anything. Personally, I hope it took the shine off her wedding for her because she sounds like an entitled, selfish AH.", "NTA and I\u2019m sorry to your family. It was silly to accept it if she didn\u2019t want it, and extremely inconsiderate to not even consult the rest of the family before doing what she did to it (even minor modifications it would still be courteous to talk it through, but this is beyond). \n\nWhatever damage she\u2019s done to the ring, the bonds and history family heirlooms represent can never be undone or destroyed, these objects are given meaning by the love we have for one another and that\u2019s still very much intact. I\u2019m sorry for what\u2019s happened to the ring, but I hope you can (all) feel better soon.", "NTA. You can never be an asshole for having the feelings that you have. \n\nWhat could make you an AH is how you act on response to feelings. Your reaction seems entirely appropriate to me. Hence the ruling.\n\nAmy is TAH.", "NTA\n\nShe and her mother knew it was wrong and that is why they lied and tried to hide the truth.\n\nShe was given a priceless heirloom and destroyed it.", "NTA.

You wanted it and didn\u2019t get it. Someone completely destroyed its original form and the way you loved it. You expected it to stay that way forever. You\u2019re disappointed in so many ways. NTA.

Your feelings are valid and your cousin is wrong for what she did even though the ring became \u201chers.\u201d\n\nEdit: Oh and you have nothing to apologize for.

If grandma wanted there to be conditions that's fine, but she should've been clear.\n\nYou picked the worst possible moment to give your two cents on how ugly the upgraded ring is, plus running to tell grandma when you must have known it would cause upset during the wedding was childish. The ring was changed already, all your outburst did was start the wedding off on an unhappy foot. Again, you're entitled to your feelings but I would've saved talking about it until after the wedding.\n\nIf you loved the original ring, find a pic of it & take it to a jeweller & get a new one made up in the same image for yourself. You can do that regardless of whether you get married one day or not. The new ring can still be passed on as an heirloom in the spirit of grandma's ring.", "ESH\nIt's fine to adapt a ring. Especially in case the ring was too small for her, then she didn't have much options than to melt it and use the stones.\n\nThe main issue is that the cousin did this without talking to grandma. But in the end it was a gift if I understood it right. So for your cousin, she thinks \"I did the best what I could do with that ring!\" You are  now mad because you don't like her taste.", "YTA. It was hers, she changed it, she can pass it down, and whoever she passes it to can change it to their own liking too.\n\nStop being jealous, it's an ugly trait.\n\nEdit - she doesn't care what the cousin did with the ring, she only cares that she got the ring and not her. It's a dumb argument that boils down to basic jealousy on the OP's part. She would have hated the cousin if she wore the ring unchanged and bitched about that too, so it's a pointless argument", "YTA   \nIt is not, and never was, your ring.", "ESH. Yes, what she did was shitty, but it wasn\u2019t necessary to tell everyone about it *right* before the wedding. The whole ceremony was tainted with tension because of it.

U sound jealous", "NTA for your feelings, but consider this:\n\nThe ring is still your grandmother\u2019s ring. Literally still the ring. It has changed shapes but it\u2019s still there. \n\nA ring is also _just_ a ring, but family is family. Now, it might be that Amy is a huge AH for other reasons, but if this is the only thing you\u2019ve had a huge disagreement on, consider apologizing, explaining that you are emotionally attached to the ring and it surprised you, and you reacted badly and hurt her. Because good family is more important than stuff, even valuable stuff we are sentimental about. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA. My grandma passed her ring set on to me when I married. I wouldn\u2019t dream of touching it.", "NTA. Nothing can be done about it now though. I'm sorry. Your cousin really sucks. Your poor grandma must be so upset.", "NTA sounds like the scene in 27 dresses where they mothers wedding dress is piece mealed to make a whole new dress. That was the breaking point for the main character. You had a lot of attachment to that ring, you are allowed to be upset.

Trashy move if you ask me.", "Yta", "NTA.\n\nI feel your pain greatly dear OP. \n\nMy granma raised me supporting my mum when I was a child so I always had a strong connection.\n\nShe died many moons ago so my mum gave me her wedding ring as a gift or heirloom if you want.\n\nI got married with it and except for engraving my wife's name inside, there no other modifications. \n\nMy wife's granma passed away from an unknown degenerative Illness when my wife was just a small baby. She asked her mum about the wedding ring and her uncle kindly passed it to her.\n\nEven that was hardly modified and was used for our marriage. \n\nI will definetely pass my one to my future grandchildren if they want as I think this dull golden ring is the last standing witness of the most beautiful love story I have ever seen (imagine my grandparents like the old man of UP and his wife)", "You're right not to want to apologise to Amy but ultimately you ask your grandmother", "Thinking the ring is trashy is one thing, but a full blown meltdown over something that's literally none of her business on the brides wedding day is just over the top and way too much.", "Agreed! It sounds like she completely destroyed a family heirloom.  If she didn't want the ring she could of given it back to her grandma instead of destroying it! You know it's bad when OP who loved the ring didn't even recognise it!\nNTA", "There are tons of people who have family jewelry remade, because they want to keep the actual jewelry but in their own style. It\u2019s not uncommon at all.\n\nIt does sound like maybe Grandma was left in the dark about this, or maybe it was a failure of communication on both sides, but it\u2019s not a weird thing to do.", "This is a great idea!", "This. I actually get emotional from this because I can relate as well. My grandfather passed away long before I was born, when my mother was 18. His wedding ring was added to my grandmother\u2019s, with three additional identical stones so it represented her five children. She still wears it to this day. I can\u2019t imagine the pain I\u2019d feel if someone melts it and uses it for parts after she passes. NTA and I\u2019m so sorry.", "How is she TA for running to Grandma?", "Grandma was gonna find out\u2026", "She shouldn't have accepted it if she didn't like it. She accepted it not as an heirloom, but as a way to get her dream ring at a discount. It's not okay to completely redesign a family heirloom ring like this. OP even says grandma had told the fiance that if the bride wasn't going to like it they didn't have to use it. They chose to use it anyway, and then destroyed it", "It was an unnecessary provocation, and it happened because OP was feeling a tumult of emotions and was unable to act rationally in that moment. This is not surprising, I think. Amy sprung this news on them on the day of the wedding, quite possibly knowing it would cause some upset. OP didn't have time to withdraw and process it. Ideally she wouldn't have told Grandma at the wedding, but when you're very emotional you don't always make the best choices.", "I think technically it wasn't right for OP to bring this up at the wedding, but the conditions for that happening were entirely set by Amy. There was only something to 'tattle' to Grandma about because Amy did something she knew Grandma would be unhappy about. She kept it from Grandma with lies (telling her she had the ring resized, not taken apart, melted down and made into two new rings with additional bling), and then revealed the new set to her cousin & sister on the day of the wedding - probably counting on people being too polite to make a fuss that day. This fell apart when OP was overwhelmed with her feelings and acted on emotion because she found it difficult to access her rationality at that moment. Jane reacted the way Amy had counted on.", "Took me a while to find this comment! Exactly this though.", "Calm down with the \"insane drama\". There was \"tension\" in the air during the ceremony, no one said anything, no one did anything.

He said that instead of having the dress altered to fit (as was the intention), his daughter had it basically torn apart with just a few scrap pieces of lace and satin incorporated in it. It looked nothing like the original,  and OP's wife was devastated. I've been trying to find that post to no avail.  But I believe OP drew back from funding his daughter's wedding.

Story!\n\nMy mom inherited her grandmother's engagement ring, which was this gorgeous HUGE (3.5 carat) roundish solitaire set in a plain white gold band. She gave it to me when I graduated college but I asked her to hold onto it until I got engaged. When the time finally came, I took the ring to get a new setting, since the old one was 100 years old and probably not super secure anymore. \n\nTurns out this roundish stone was actually cushion cut. And cushion cut diamonds from 100 years ago were STUNNING. They were designed to sparkle best under candlelight, so I've read. It was set to look more round by having the four corners of the setting attached to the flatter sides, rather than the rounded corners. So with the new setting, I chose very durable 10K white gold (not as soft as 24K) and to have it set by the corners. It totally changed the look of the diamond in the best possible way.\n\nI showed my mom and she was stunned. She LOVED IT. It enhanced the beauty of this very important stone. Plus I kept the now-diamondless old setting, which perhaps someone will want to use in the future (or melt into earring studs or something). \n\nBut this girl completely changed the entire ring concept and design. That's a bridge too far. Should have bought some garish crap from Zales.", "Exactly. Say no if you didnt want it as your engagement ring. Or wear it as a ring but not an engagement ring.", "100%. OP isn't in the wrong, Amy *did* destroy the ring.", "Ideally, she would have just respectfully declined.

Would be lovely for her to be a part of a rebuilding of her history.", "I do hope OP will look into having a replica made. Perhaps Grandma would even be happy to knowingly(!) contribute an older piece of jewelry that Grandpa gave her at some point, that's more in a condition where melting it down would be appropriate so that something actually from Grandma can be used in the materials. It's not ideal, but it would probably mean a great deal to Grandma that OP cares.", "definitely, I think older people especially tend to stay quiet in situations like this just to avoid causing problems in the family, even if they\u2019re upset. but everyone needs to express how they feel, so I think talking it through with grandma 1 on 1 is a good thing for OP to do", "And Amy\u2019s mother is grandmother\u2019s DIL right?

You don't mention wanting to talk about it before the wedding to \"warn\" Grandma, you just said you went to find her immediately and ask her.\n\nAmy sucks massively for what she did and it's obvious that she at least partially knew it would be not taken well because she just said she was getting it resized. But I do wonder if she initially missed the fact that this is not okay. I know when people pass their wedding dresses down it's common for them to no longer be fashionable so people sort of remake them or even just use some of the original material in a new dress. But even in that case it's usually like... discussed. Maybe to Amy her new ring truly does hold just as much sentimental value because it contains the physical parts of the original ring, but she wasn't sure if what she did was socially acceptable or not.

Old rings of Grandma's vintage were set with beautiful hand-cut diamonds that don't have all the fussy micro-marking that today's diamonds do to prevent fraud.  They were often set in artisan settings, and not churned out by computerized machines.  With that said, it is also an item that your grandfather worked and saved to purchase.  It was the ring of choice when he placed it on his bride's finger and said \"I do.\"  She wore the ring, owned it her entire life; a small but significant symbol she cherished of the bond she had and the love she still felt for the man she made a family with.  She had it through motherhood, and chose the one that she thought would cherish it also, and be respectful of a gift imbued with family history, emotions, and significance.  Then sister just took a shit all over that gift and saw it only as dollar value she could melt all the things I just described off it, and turned it into raw materials.   It was a cold, callous, slap in your Grandmother's face, to she the sad remains of her beloved ring turned into something unrecognizable.  It had to be heartbreaking for her.  \n\nHow do I know this is how it goes?  I have my Mother-In-Law's wedding ring, her engagement ring, and her husband's ring.  She gave them to me when she found out she was dying of a medical condition.  I knew that parting with them was very hard for her, but I was the one her son chose to marry so they came to me.  I can't even fathom the idea of melting them down.  If I did that, they would lose all their history, and well over half of their value as heirlooms.\n\nI know there are people who don't feel they have to preserve family history or keep treasured items, but to me, it feels cold, indifferent, and downright wrong to destroy any item handed down to you.  And yes, your sister destroyed that gift.  It's components still exist, but not as that heirloom.  If someone were to tell me they made their own ring out of a grandmother's own wedding ring, it would be hard for me to hide the sadness that grandmother felt. In fact, I might even ask them how come they were so broke they had to destroy an item so cherished.  Sister's ring is not one she made out of her Grandmother's ring. It's a ring she made after melting down the ring given as a gift.\n\nGod for bid anyone give her a gift and expect her to keep it.  Car? She might repaint it and stick doll heads all over it.  That beautiful burlwood secretary desk, chopped and turned into a TV stand.  The books grandpa brought over with him when he emigrated as a refugee child?

The ring is made of a relatively pure metal, arranged into a particular shape, which is a collection of atoms of a particular element, which is in turn made of protons, neutrons and electrons, all of which in turn are made of quarks. There is also a diamond, made of carbon in a particular arrangement, which is made of... etc.\n\nThe only thing that distinguishes the diamond ring from a lump of the metal and some carbon is _how_ the metal and carbon is arranged. But the arrangement is not an intrinsic property of the ring in the same way that the atomic weight of the metal is. \n\nSo it seems like a valid question to ask how \"real\" an object is when the identity of the object depends on how it's arranged. \n\nWhich leads some people to hold that there aren't chairs and tables and rings, but just \"stuff\" arranged chair-wise or ring-wise.\n\nAristotle sums up the issue thusly:\n\n> It is natural to distinguish a thing, an individual, a token, from any particular properties that the thing happens to have. The table is hard, brown, rectangular, and so on. But it is not identical with its hardness, brownness, rectangularity. These properties are rather naturally taken to be things it merely has\u2026 With things and properties thus distinguished, even if very intimately connected, we have what may be called a substance-attribute view\n\nWithout even knowing that they are doing so, Op and their cousin, as well as many commenters here, are playing out exactly this argument.

Sure, if you think about it, you might still feel those things, but it\u2019s semantics to make the argument about whether or not active or passive feelings of anger are still being angry about something. In short, yes, being an adult means you need to be able to choose when to *actively* feel emotions vs. accepting that you do feel a certain way about something but refusing to allow that emotion to control your life.
