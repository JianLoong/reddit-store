Yes it\u2019s tasteless to melt down an old family ring, but it\u2019s also bad to cause a scene about it on her wedding day.", "To be fair, you are not wrong for feelings these things, like Jane said can\u2019t change it now, it\u2019s already fucked up. But you did let your emotions run that day. Your cousins day. Her wedding day. A gift is given, afterwards you can\u2019t say what someone does with it. It\u2019s an heirloom yes would it have gone to you? Never, so no it was not fair from you to rain on her parade and hot go tattle to grandma\u2026", "YTA. First of all the ring was a gift. While it would have been nice for her to keep it intact she was under no obligation to do so. \n\nSecondly - you started an argument with her in her wedding day and then decided that was a good time to drag your grandmother into it. You couldn\u2019t have waited until after the wedding to interfere, you had to do it during the wedding. Not cool", "ESH - ugh I\u2019ve never known anyone where this Tradition worked out for. Everyone sucks. You suck most because you brought this up and created insane drama on her wedding day. Not okay. Your grandma kinda sucks because she probably should have been more careful about Who she gave it to. She gave it to the person who cared least which tells me she didn\u2019t put a lot of effort into thinking about who would really love it. I don\u2019t think Amy should have done it without telling your grandma However, none of that is your business. Amy deserves her own ring. Every woman does. Including your grandma. Each bride deserves a symbol of love that is unique to her relationship so I understand Amy wanting to make it hers but this is a shining example of why sometimes these traditions don\u2019t work. Everyone is upset. You, Amy, Grandma, Jane. Which could have been avoided by having your grandma keep Her ring to remember Her love story and everyone else getting Their own rings to remember Their love story.", "You ask your question in two different ways in your post, and I think my answer would be different for each.\n\nYou are N-T-A for feeling the way you do. Your feelings about this are understandable.\nBut I think YTA for what you did with those feelings. \nMaybe you couldn\u2019t control your initial reaction, but then you tried to drag your Grandma into this fight on your cousin\u2019s wedding day. At that point nothing could be done, you didn\u2019t need to try and sour the day for more people.", "ESH \nWhile your reaction in the heat of the moment is understandable, going out of your way to find your grandmother and tell her this mid-wedding really comes across as sabotage. Jane had the right idea here, because instead of your grandmother noticing on her own, you've put yourself in the middle of a conflict that isn't your business. \n\nAs for your cousin, while it is technically correct that a person can do whatever they want with a gift, basic decency still applies. Not having the courage to say \"grandmother, thank you for the ring, I am going to use it for parts\", is a situation of your cousin's own making.", "I would say NTA if the ring was willed to/rightfully yours, because it is shitty what Amy did to the ring. However, it was gifted to her since she\u2019s higher up the inheritance food chain, and as it\u2019s her possession she has every right to do with it as she pleases, for better or for worse.

I definitely understand that you had feelings about that ring, and the disappointment that it went to someone who didn't value it the way you did is real. \n\n\nBut.\n\n\nOnce a gift is given, it belongs to the recipient. It was never your ring, and it was no longer your grandmother's either.", "YTA. It's not yours and it obviously wasn't to your cousin's taste. Also, it's not like it's something that was handed down over hundreds of years. If you like it so much, go get one made.", "ESH\n\nAmy and her mom are AHs because they clearly knew Grandma would be upset about what she did with the ring and that's why they chose not to tell her.  And in addition to not asking they were just letting her be confronted by it on the day of. In addition if Amy didn't love the setting it would have made way more sense for her to keep the diamond and gift the setting.  But whatever. \n\nYou are NTA for bursting into tears upon finding out, but at that point you should have forking excused yourself from the room to cry. Later on you paste on a smile and you let her get through the day.  Instead you confronted a bride on HER WEDDING DAY about something no one can change now and that makes you a massive AH.", "I could understand having something separated to be re-set, but not utterly destroyed like that, that's horrific", "ESH, You're an AH because you told grandma about it during the wedding day", "With the caveat that I wasn\u2019t there when it happened and only heard about it after, Grandma offered the ring to John but didn\u2019t pressure him into taking it. She told him he didn\u2019t have to take it if he didn\u2019t think Amy would want it, so the implication was that she was offering the ring as is, and there would be no hard feelings if they didn\u2019t take it. Jane also told me that Grandma offered her the ring after she and her wife eloped but Jane turned it down because she and her wife didn\u2019t do engagement rings and at the time she thought either Amy or me would want it as an engagement ring. So no, Grandma didn\u2019t say \u201cyou have to keep it this way\u201d but now I know that she never imagined that any of us would basically use it for parts.", "NTA. If you can afford it, collect some old (not heirloom) jewelry and get it melted down to make a replica. You and Grandma will feel better, and you can pass the replica down with a passive-aggressive story about why we don't trust Amy with nice things, lol.", "Oh my goddd NTA your poor grandmother that would break my heart a bit on her shoes\u2026 way to go Amy, glad she got her gauche diamonds lol she probs isn\u2019t getting anything else from grandma now, why even take the heirloom in the first place if you\u2019re going to Frankenstein it, especially with so much emotional significance to it. I had a grandpa who passed early in his marriage to my grandma, I don\u2019t think anyone in our family would do something like this with any of the jewellery he gave her, let alone a Wedding Ring???\n\nSorry I am just so taken aback by this, so needless and wanky of the bride and good way for her to sour relationships within the family by causing everyone to take sides which I\u2019m sure they have done\u2026 big Oof", "NTA.  That said, there's nothing you can do about it.  I'd talk to her calmly tell her how YOU feel.  Don't blame her or tell her what she should've done, explain how her actions made you feel and what that ring meant to you.  I personally think that a ring, no matter how sentimentally valuable, is not worth losing a good relationship with your cousin.  If you're going to apologize, don't apologize for your opinion, apologize for how you made her feel/made her special day less enjoyable.", "NTA you should've told her it was ugleee.", "NTA. This is heartbreaking and I am sad for you and your grandmother, OP. \n\nThis whole story is giving me major 27 Dresses vibes and making me crave that level of petty revenge. Immature, I know, but so is destroying a cherished gift like a ring or gown simply for the piecesparts. \n\nOP, I wish I had good advice to help you get over this but I don't have any. Hug your grandmother extra tight though. She likely could use it.", "NTA for your emotional reaction. Maybe telling Grandma at the wedding was a bit uncalled for, but you were feeling hurt, betrayed and angry so it's unsurprising you weren't completely rational. I think it would have been better to make Amy tell Grandma what she did to the ring (not at the wedding, however).\n\nJane has the right attitude - while what Amy did was upsetting, there's nothing to be done now and technically the ring does belong to her, so while it was unfeeling and self-centred, Amy didn't ethically do wrong. You're also right about how Amy viewed the ring, but again - not your ring.", "After reading so many things about heirlooms I'm just happy I don't have any.", "NTA. There\u2019s some good suggestions in the thread about getting another ring made based on pics of the original that might help both you and your grandma feel better. You\u2019re right, Amy was dishonest in her approach and you don\u2019t owe her an apology for calling her out or being upset. She didn\u2019t want the ring and she should have said so. Gutting it for parts is the accurate description of what she did, and you\u2019re correct in that she (and her mom) lied about it to cover what her actual aims were for an heirloom.", "NTA for your emotions, it's a shitty and selfish thing she did.", "NTA I have an heirloom ring. It\u2019s not my style, but I love it and would never touch it. (Other than to resize it.)", "NTA! It was a family heirloom. Amy and John should have asked Grandma permission first before making any changes to the ring. Your reaction to the news is understandable.", "NTA completely understandable reaction.", "NTA and you don't owe her an apology for anything. Personally, I hope it took the shine off her wedding for her because she sounds like an entitled, selfish AH.", "NTA and I\u2019m sorry to your family. It was silly to accept it if she didn\u2019t want it, and extremely inconsiderate to not even consult the rest of the family before doing what she did to it (even minor modifications it would still be courteous to talk it through, but this is beyond). \n\nWhatever damage she\u2019s done to the ring, the bonds and history family heirlooms represent can never be undone or destroyed, these objects are given meaning by the love we have for one another and that\u2019s still very much intact. I\u2019m sorry for what\u2019s happened to the ring, but I hope you can (all) feel better soon.", "NTA. You can never be an asshole for having the feelings that you have. \n\nWhat could make you an AH is how you act on response to feelings. Your reaction seems entirely appropriate to me. Hence the ruling.\n\nAmy is TAH.", "NTA\n\nShe and her mother knew it was wrong and that is why they lied and tried to hide the truth.\n\nShe was given a priceless heirloom and destroyed it.", "NTA. Your cousin sounds like a real b**** to me and your poor grandma must be so upset and hurt. I have little family and no heirlooms, but I understand the importance of how you must be feeling..", "I understand that you wanted it really badly and loved it the way it was. You wanted it and didn\u2019t get it. Someone completely destroyed its original form and the way you loved it. You expected it to stay that way forever. You\u2019re disappointed in so many ways. NTA. But she isn\u2019t the AH either for been given a ring and she did what she wanted with it. She is an AH for not asking grandma first imo.", "NTA. You\u2019re right that she\u2019s in the wrong for misleading your grandmother and acting like she only had it resized instead of changing the design of the ring completely.", "NTA\n\nIf they wanted to repurpose a ring they should have gone to an Op Shop or pawnbroker.\n\nThat's insensitive and ungrateful behaviour.", "NTA\n\nI bet Grandma is keeping this in mind, change to the will coming.", "You are absolutely 100% in every shape, way, and form NTA. Your feelings are valid and your cousin is wrong for what she did even though the ring became \u201chers.\u201d\n\nEdit: Oh and you have nothing to apologize for. Don\u2019t let anyone pressure you into doing so. \ud83e\udd0d", "NTA a family heirloom was turned into a tacky mall ring.", "I think we would need a comparison of two pictures to understand the degree of the \"upgrade\".", "ESH - you (and grandma) are entitled to your feelings, but unless the ring was given to Amy on the understanding it would not be altered other than resizing so it could be passed on as a family heirloom than she didn't do anything wrong. Once we give a gift, it's the recipient's to do with as they like. If grandma wanted there to be conditions that's fine, but she should've been clear.\n\nYou picked the worst possible moment to give your two cents on how ugly the upgraded ring is, plus running to tell grandma when you must have known it would cause upset during the wedding was childish. The ring was changed already, all your outburst did was start the wedding off on an unhappy foot. Again, you're entitled to your feelings but I would've saved talking about it until after the wedding.\n\nIf you loved the original ring, find a pic of it & take it to a jeweller & get a new one made up in the same image for yourself. You can do that regardless of whether you get married one day or not. The new ring can still be passed on as an heirloom in the spirit of grandma's ring.", "ESH\nIt's fine to adapt a ring. Especially in case the ring was too small for her, then she didn't have much options than to melt it and use the stones.\n\nThe main issue is that the cousin did this without talking to grandma. But in the end it was a gift if I understood it right. So for your cousin, she thinks \"I did the best what I could do with that ring!\" You are  now mad because you don't like her taste.", "YTA. It was hers, she changed it, she can pass it down, and whoever she passes it to can change it to their own liking too.\n\nStop being jealous, it's an ugly trait.\n\nEdit - she doesn't care what the cousin did with the ring, she only cares that she got the ring and not her. It's a dumb argument that boils down to basic jealousy on the OP's part. She would have hated the cousin if she wore the ring unchanged and bitched about that too, so it's a pointless argument", "YTA   \nIt is not, and never was, your ring.", "ESH. Yes, what she did was shitty, but it wasn\u2019t necessary to tell everyone about it *right* before the wedding. The whole ceremony was tainted with tension because of it. It definitely could have waited a day or two.", "Idgi it\u2019s her ring now grandma gave it to her to WEAR forever essentially. U sound jealous", "NTA for your feelings, but consider this:\n\nThe ring is still your grandmother\u2019s ring. Literally still the ring. It has changed shapes but it\u2019s still there. \n\nA ring is also _just_ a ring, but family is family. Now, it might be that Amy is a huge AH for other reasons, but if this is the only thing you\u2019ve had a huge disagreement on, consider apologizing, explaining that you are emotionally attached to the ring and it surprised you, and you reacted badly and hurt her. Because good family is more important than stuff, even valuable stuff we are sentimental about. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA. My grandma passed her ring set on to me when I married. I wouldn\u2019t dream of touching it.", "NTA. Nothing can be done about it now though. I'm sorry. Your cousin really sucks. Your poor grandma must be so upset.", "NTA sounds like the scene in 27 dresses where they mothers wedding dress is piece mealed to make a whole new dress. That was the breaking point for the main character. You had a lot of attachment to that ring, you are allowed to be upset. That\u2019s super unfortunate because it can\u2019t be undone.", "Nta, your cousin destroyed something important to you and your family that was meant to be a gift. Trashy move if you ask me.", "Yta", "NTA.\n\nI feel your pain greatly dear OP. \n\nMy granma raised me supporting my mum when I was a child so I always had a strong connection.\n\nShe died many moons ago so my mum gave me her wedding ring as a gift or heirloom if you want.\n\nI got married with it and except for engraving my wife's name inside, there no other modifications. \n\nMy wife's granma passed away from an unknown degenerative Illness when my wife was just a small baby. She asked her mum about the wedding ring and her uncle kindly passed it to her.\n\nEven that was hardly modified and was used for our marriage. \n\nI will definetely pass my one to my future grandchildren if they want as I think this dull golden ring is the last standing witness of the most beautiful love story I have ever seen (imagine my grandparents like the old man of UP and his wife)", "You're right not to want to apologise to Amy but ultimately you ask your grandmother", "Thinking the ring is trashy is one thing, but a full blown meltdown over something that's literally none of her business on the brides wedding day is just over the top and way too much.", "Agreed! It sounds like she completely destroyed a family heirloom.  If she didn't want the ring she could of given it back to her grandma instead of destroying it! You know it's bad when OP who loved the ring didn't even recognise it!\nNTA", "There are tons of people who have family jewelry remade, because they want to keep the actual jewelry but in their own style. It\u2019s not uncommon at all.\n\nIt does sound like maybe Grandma was left in the dark about this, or maybe it was a failure of communication on both sides, but it\u2019s not a weird thing to do.", "This is a great idea!", "This. I actually get emotional from this because I can relate as well. My grandfather passed away long before I was born, when my mother was 18. His wedding ring was added to my grandmother\u2019s, with three additional identical stones so it represented her five children. She still wears it to this day. I can\u2019t imagine the pain I\u2019d feel if someone melts it and uses it for parts after she passes. NTA and I\u2019m so sorry.", "How is she TA for running to Grandma?", "Grandma was gonna find out\u2026", "She shouldn't have accepted it if she didn't like it. She accepted it not as an heirloom, but as a way to get her dream ring at a discount. It's not okay to completely redesign a family heirloom ring like this. OP even says grandma had told the fiance that if the bride wasn't going to like it they didn't have to use it. They chose to use it anyway, and then destroyed it", "It was an unnecessary provocation, and it happened because OP was feeling a tumult of emotions and was unable to act rationally in that moment. This is not surprising, I think. Amy sprung this news on them on the day of the wedding, quite possibly knowing it would cause some upset. OP didn't have time to withdraw and process it.
