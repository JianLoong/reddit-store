It's a beautiful, appropriate dress, and you should wear it and feel good about it, but it's not a wallflower dress. If she's concerned, you could go without earrings or wear a more subtle pair.

While I would never be able to drop 5k on a dress, I understand the difference.", "Nobody buys a $5K dress because it's not their favorite and they hope they look shabby in it.
