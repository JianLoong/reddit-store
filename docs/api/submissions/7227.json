It's at a startup company that's high risk high reward so it's a gamble if the company will still exist in a few years, but for now it's great! \n\nI decided I didn't want to change my lifestyle at all, since the money's probably temporary. So I kept on spending like always and just put all the extra money into maxing out my retirement savings and paying down my house.\n\nI've also been in a relationship with my boyfriend Jason for about a year and a half. He makes 90k so he's doing really well himself, were both in a low cost of living rural area and he's still making a lot more then average here. \n\nBut after I got the new job, he started being really critical of how I spend... Or don't. Like I wanted to build a sunroom gazebo for my house so I went to the construction material recycling and reuse center to buy some lumber and some vintage windows, to make it. Woodworking and DIY is genuinely a hobby of mine, but my boyfriend made fun of me for still going to the \"junkyard\" to build the gazebo even when I could afford to hire a contractor.\n\nBut the bigger fight has been about a vacation, we'd planned to do a road trip in the summer, camping most of the way, and staying in hotels a night or two a week to shower and stay near cities we visit. But after I got the new job, he wants to stay in hotels every night. I was kinda stressed about that because I don't wanna start spending like I'll always have this kind of cash flow and have that lifestyle creep, since I know it might not last, and I don't want to feel disappointed or struggle when I have to scale back my spending. \n\nSo it was really important to me to just put away whatever extra money that's temporarily coming thru for the future. But my boyfriend told me I was being ridiculous, wanting to sleep on the ground on our vacation when I was making so much. I said I love camping, I was looking forward to all the camping and hiking and climbing we'd planned. And he just kinda snapped at me saying that I seem to \"love\" everything that's cheap or free, and it's kinda entitled honestly. \n\nI said if anyone's acting entitled, it's honestly him, when he just wanted me to pay for something he didn't even ask if I wanted. Didn't offer to split the cost or anything, it's like he just saw me making more and decided he wanted to spend it. \n\nWe had this big fight where he said I was all \"me me me\" only caring about my house and my retirement, and how I'd spend thousands a month paying my mortgage faster than I need to but wouldn't even do the minimum to make our vacation nice. \n\nAITA for wanting to use the money coming in from a new job to save for the future?", "created_utc": 1673625415, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10axxtv/aita_for_wanting_to_pay_down_my_house_instead_of/", "score": 358, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've got the money, use it.\n\nLike you, I tend to think more long term and I'd rather stay in a shitty hotel than a nice hotel - even if I can afford it.

Putting money towards paying off debt is a wise choice.\n\nHe sounds entitled and looking to live off your dime by suddenly changing the vacation plans.\n\nMaybe you should be more \"me me me\" and find someone who respects you more.", "NTA. You seems really sensible. You're making the most of the money you're earning while being realistic about the fact that this much income might be temporary.

Stick to your guns and know you're doing exactly the right thing.", "NTA. \n\nYou are not a vending machine, your boyfriend doesn't get to use your windfall for his benefit. \n\nYour money, your rules, your decision on how to spend it.\n\nI'm sure the sunroom will look lovely.", "NTA. He doesn't have any aay in how you spend your hard earned money, or don't spent it. Youre being smart about all of this while he's being an asshole. \n\nI'd rethink the relationship if he doesn't change his tune.", "I don't understand at all! If you really love camping why would you go stay in a hotel? The point of the trip was to camp and hike... Correct? Yeah he definitely wants to spend your money, it's telling that he didn't offer to pay half of the trip!

Clearly you're NTA", "NTA, and as an added investment in your future you have solid information now on how vastly different your financial priorities are from your bfs. \n\n Don't marry this guy.

You\u2019ve got your head screwed and know that this income may be temporary so are planning accordingly/wisely. \n\nTell your boyfriend that you\u2019ll match whatever he contributes to the vacation.", "Your boyfriend is trying to control the way you spend your money because he feels *entitled* to it.

He\u2019s not going to offer to split the cost because he wants to bleed you dry financially. \n\nI think you need to pay your mortgage if this is a better investment for you, which you\u2019re being smart with this and you are right. This relationship isn\u2019t going to work out for you both because this will get so much worse. You do not want to be with someone who is financially abusing you. I\u2019ve been through it, and you need to save yourself before you end up financially depleted and destitute because you\u2019re with someone who is forcing you to throw all of your money away.\n\nNTA. You need to leave him for your own sake.", "NTA. How is not spending money entitled?! As you'll have your house forever and your bf for probably another six months I would ignore his complaints about you not spending your money on him...", "NTA. I\u2019m low income but the smartest thing I did was pay off my mortgage. I wish I had been making bigger payments all along.  What a liberating feeling it is to have that bill gone. \n\nI will note you cannot make too big of a lump payment on your mortgage without a penalty. So it\u2019s good to ask the bank what the biggest lump payment you can make without a penalty and pay that amount and balance a bit with a slight improvement to the vacation if you really want to.", "NTA \n\nYou're only together a year and a half and he's already jumped right on the 'our money' bandwagon. \n\nLong-term, retirement funds and a paid off house will be mutually beneficial. He's only thinking short-term, which really highlights what he thinks of your relationship... 'here for a good time, not a long time'. If you're looking for a long term commited relationship, this guy might be the wrong dude.", "Nta\n\nYou are doing the right thing by being smart with your money while you have it. Your boyfriend is behaving like an entitled brat, you\u2019re not married and therefore he has absolutely no say over how you spend your money.", "\"since the money's probably temporary\"\n\nNTA - Who knows it's a crap shoot with start ups but you completely have the right attitude here. Who knows how long the gravy train will last but you should absolutely maximize it whilst it does.", "NtA. He shouldn't even be concerning himself with YOUR money. He's a user. If you ditch the dead weight, you can have a vacation AND pay off your house faster.", "NTA. *Obviously* NTA. It says something meaningful about how much your boyfriend has gotten into your head that there is any *possible* way you could believe that you are the AH on something where *he* is so obviously in the wrong.\n\nWith the judgment out of the way, you just need to consider whether you actually want to be in a relationship with someone who is treating you this way. He's acting entitled about *your* money, he's belittling you for enjoying things like DIY and camping, he's claiming that you are selfish for planning for the future instead of taking him on the vacation that *he* wants (but isn't willing to pay for himself)... That's not a nice person\n\nEven if we ignore the awful way he's treating you right now, do you really want to be in a relationship who has such a different view on spending versus saving? That is a major source of strife in relationships, and it's nearly impossible to overcome a basic values difference like that. Can you really see yourself combining finances with someone who thinks you should take your perhaps once-in-a-lifetime windfall and *not* use it to make your future life easier?", "NTA \n\n>Didn't offer to split the cost or anything, it's like he just saw me making more and decided he wanted to spend it. \n\nThis is key. Sure it would be nice to splurge on a vacation but that's a conversation to have together. You do make more but spending should be equitable. You aren't married and maybe you don't even live together, because you referred to it as \"my house\" and didn't mention him living there. You also said just got the promotion they aren't giving you 300k per paycheck. It makes sense to save and work on paying down debt now.", "NTA. Occasional camping on a road trip honestly sounds better than hotels. There's absolutely nothing wrong with a focus on securing your future, especially getting a house paid off. Knowing that your home is bought and paid for is a HUGE albatross off ones back.\n\nThat being said, i can see the merit in splurging on yourselves a little bit but how much is this vacation really gonna cost? With a combined income of 400k and what you described as a low cost of living, maybe look at your budget for the trip and see if you can bump it a little bit.", "NTA. You got a massive raise and all of sudden you need to be his atm? Heck no!", "NTA, it's your money and you're saving it for both of your futures. It can be said that there's no need to be as cheap as you are when it's the matter of a couple thousand out of the extra 190,000 you're going to get for a couple years. He's not exactly asking for a 70k car or anything. HOWEVER your cheapness isn't actually you being cheap, you enjoy DIY-ing and you enjoy camping and him not being able to understand what things bring you joy is very concerning. So you're NTA here, it's your money and you're not being overly cheap just for the sake of it, you're just doing what you like. He has enough money himself if he really wants the hotel, 90k is by no means broke", "NTA. This does not sound good. He seems to think that your financial situation should benefit him. You should not change plans. Like you said, high risk, high reward, and the bubble may burst. Saving up or investing is smart. \n\nGet him a nice air mattress to make his vacation nice. Think long and hard about the relationship.", "NTA only because he was expecting you to shoulder the costs yourself. Theoretically, the specifics of a shared vacation should be decided on together. If you want to camp but he wants to stay in hotels, then you come to some sort of compromise (e.g. camp half the time, or stay in hotels for the next vacation). I think your concern about raising your cost of living is misplaced; staying in hotels shouldn't be a huge expense unless you pick 5-star ones or something. However, if you're both working yet only one of you is paying for something, I think it's reasonable for that person to get their way.\n\nI do wonder whether your boyfriend's objection that it's always \"me me me\" reflects deeper resentments in your relationship. You need to talk with him about that.", "NTA. You are being very smart. I am on the retirement end of doing this and I am very happy I saved so much. \nYour boyfriend doesn\u2019t seem to think of you as a smart independent person who can make their own decisions. He also seems to feel entitled to and in control of your assets. I would find this very offensive. I wouldn\u2019t put up with it if that was the case.", "NTA.  I agree with you, your boyfriend is coming off as very selfish and entitled here.\n\nIf he wants to sleep in hotels during the vacation rather than camping I think that's a fair thing to bring up but he should assume that you are splitting costs evenly and say he's happy to pay that.", "NTA \n\nYour money, your house, your life. Spend and/or save as you see fit. It sounds like you're being sensible and making sure you're sorted out financially. Your BF sounds entitled and resentful.", "NTA. He should not be spending your money for you OR criticizing how you choose to live.\n\nIf you value the relationship, draw those boundaries clearly.\n\nRegarding the vacation (if you want to go), it should absolutely be completely shared/split expense and within what you both are happy with. That means that if he wants hotels, you go on a shorter trip. However, if you really enjoy camping, this just isn't someone who's going to be a good travel partner for you if he just doesn't like camping.\n\nHow are finances shared in any other area? Is this guy living with you? You need to work out so much based on this.\n\nIf you think you're otherwise compatible, consider counseling. This is a huge difference in values and attitudes. He's trying to control you, and that is not okay. So, you may just find this isn't the match you thought it was.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend is the walking, talking embodiment of entitlement and you should treat this as a huge red flag. \n\nNobody should tell you how to spend your money and demand that you put your hand in your pocket for them - not least someone you've only been dating for 18 months. The plan you've put in place for the extra you're making is extremely prudent and has absolutely NOTHING to do with your boyfriend at all. \n\nI'd be reconsidering this relationship if I were you, because he sounds like a freeloading, controlling AH.", "NTA and I don't think he understands what the word entitled means. At all.\n\nYou sound like you have a great grasp of the situation. Keep on keeping on, and if your partner dislikes it, he can pay for things himself.", "He was fine with the vacation before you got a raise. It's your money, and you are not married. Your boyfriend needs to take a chill pill.", "NTA", "Your BF thinks what is your money is his. You are right about him acting entitled.  You only have been together for 1.5 yrs and you have learned more about him now.  \n\nI believe that we learn about each other over time, under varying circumstances and situations.  Alignment of values in how money should be looked at and managed is big in a relationship.\n\nThis is your future you are looking at.  Do you want to \"spend\" your life with such a person?\n\nMy personal experience was having inherited money from my mother and my wife wanted to buy a summer house.  I wanted to invest it for all I saw was yet another place to take care of/maintain, to furnish, to be looked after, etc. while being tied to one place for vacations.  I'd rather go to a hotel, get room service and go back home which would be cheaper and less hassle.  We are now divorced.  I postulated that she got her entitlement views from her mother who was a SAHM suburban, alcoholic, self absorbed, narcissistic matron leaching off her corporate executive husband with a summer house in Nantucket.", "NTA. If you have a good mortgage rate you shouldn't pay extra on your loan right now, though; with inflation being what it is that'll benefit the bank more than you. Sunroom and gazebo sound like better options.", "NTA. I'd be reconsidering that relationship if I were you. Sounds like he's resentful and jealous of you making so much more than him and it will likely only get worse.", "nta at all.  Starts ups... can go belly up real quick.  If he wants a bed he can offer at least half.  He really feels entitled to your money.", "**NTA** Always not TA when other people are trying to tell you how to spend your money.\n\nIf he was offering to pay, that's one thing. He clearly feels entitled to choose how your pay increase will be spent and you need to decide what you want to do with that.", "Yikes, NTA\n\nYour boyfriend sounds strangely entitled to your finances. \n\nI *personally* would want to do some sort of celebratory splurge if I made that jump in salary, and a nice trip with my partner would be on my mind - but that doesn\u2019t entitle him to it, and his current attitude would really put me off of wanting to", "Dump the loser. Why does he want you to pay for everything? He can pick up the hotel costs or stfu", "No need to argue with him. It's your money and you can spend it how you like, so NTA. But please remember how he is acting for all your future choices because whether you continue making this money or not is irrelevant - what is not irrelevant, however, is how your boyfriend is trying to tell you how to spend your money with him being part of it. It's never without him involved, and I think that's a pretty decent red flag for if you were to get engaged and married later down the line.", "He seems like the what\u2019s your is mine and what\u2019s mine is mine type", "NTA! your money! your way of spending it! your decision!!! as long as you're happy and comfortable screw your boyfriend. he just wants a sugar mama to foot the bill!!!\n\na point tho - i believe you can write off your mortgage interest on your tax return...so that might be one thing to think about before paying off all your mortgage at once.", "NTA. It's your money.  Also as you said it's a start up, so this cash flow may not be long lived or it could be, but sounds like you want to prepare to remain solvent. This trip was planned before the job move, if it was good enough then, then why not now?  \n\nVacations are for you to enjoy as you want to, enjoy your time.  And good going on the gazebo, it's a hobby, and it's great you find enjoyment of it. \n\nI have a neighbor who's successful in finance, guess what, he changes his own car oil and swaps snow tires, not that he can't afford to, but he enjoys it. \n\nJust think twice of paying off that mortgage, if  it's a real low rate you may not want to, but I get the idea of wanting to get that debt paid off. \n\nGood luck", "NTA...You're very sensible and prudent.  Your extra money is not for your boyfriend to waste. He needs to learn to enjoy what you have.", "At that salary, is there not enough money to save for the future AND stay in hotels every night? It seems like he's not into camping as much as you are. Personally, I would also love to spend a few of those nights at a camp ground. It seems like at least a couple of different issues going on here.", "NTA.  Your bf of a year and a half has no business telling you how to spend your money.", "NTA.  You should really be looking at how you two value money differently.  Money is the biggest stressor in relationships and if you two have such different ideas around it, it needs to be considered if you are planning on being together in the future.", "If it was *just* the vacay thing? I might understand his side. I love to camp, my partner would much rather be in a hotel. And as I make a lot more than him, I pay for our vacays. Knowing how much he hates sleeping on the ground, I\u2019d probably splurge for some hotel rooms if I had a little bit of spare cash. \n\nBut you\u2019re NTA to say no and to try to keep spending within or under your means. Him acting like you\u2019re somehow slighting him or being ridiculous is just totally AG.\n\nWealthy people don\u2019t get there by spending every cent they make.", "NTA - this bf sounds very entitled to OPs money. Why can\u2019t he pay for the hotel??? Also mocking OP for using reused lumber and vintage windows in a DIY project is just weird. Wealthy people pay big money for contractors/designers to use reclaimed wood.", "NTA, your boyfriend is being and entitled jerk. I do think that with a financial improvement as large as the one you\u2019re describing it\u2019s totally reasonable to splurge a little on vacation as a treat. That does not have result in lifestyle creep. I\u2019ve been on fancy vacations but I also still like camping and road-tripping. But only do that if YOU want to. Otherwise if he wants fancy hotels he can offer to pay or at least suggest you split.", "NTA. Good God, please drop his dead weight. He is wanting to spend your money and build a foundation of insecurity in you. That is malicious and manipulative. If you respect yourself, you know you can do infinitely better than him, my dear. \n\nYou are very practical and level headed. Do not let him shake you. Keep on track with your lifestyle and habits if it makes you happy. You owe no one an explanation.", "Let me break out my Mariachi band for the parade of red flags here. He wants you to fund things you aren't comfortable with [checks notes] with your money? He is upset you want to pay down your house faster, again with your money. AND that you are saving YOUR money for retirement and a rainy day? WTF time to put your big ole foot down and tell him that you will live at your standard of living period. If he is uncomfortable with that, either having some counseling (if you want to save the relationship) or some ultimatums (if you are willing to make this your hill to die on). One would think having a fiscally responsible life partner is a good thing.. it may lead to having no mortgage and plump retirement lifestyle at a later point if you are both a bit more frugal now... personally this IS a hill I would sacrifice a relationship on.", "NTA\n\nHe is just a boyfriend. He gets absolutely zero say in how you spend your own money. Period. \n\nHe has zero stakes here. He has no concerns at all about how much you owe on your house because it doesn't impact him. Nor does it matter to him if you spend all your money on a contractor. So yeah, his opinion is irrelevant. \n\nIf he wants to stay in hotels he should pay.", "NTA\n\nIf you feel like being petty, dump him, and go on a month long vacation by yourself. Enjoy!", "NTA \nHe\u2019s very entitled thinking he has a right to make decisions on your money so it benefits him. \n\nYou are sensible, in tough times, the roof over your head and the money for your future is very important. \n\nIf he insists calculate the cost of the holiday with all the hotels and ask him him for half of it up front before you book. He just wants to spend YOUR money, not his so he won\u2019t pay.", "NTA \n\nHe needs to look up a dictionary. He is trying to dictate how you spend *your* income.

I'm a woman in the same industry as you and even if the company fails it's likely you'll continue to make significantly more than him and he's now shown he can't handle that maturely. If you can't even discuss things like this without it turning into a major fight it's a red flag imo. Ask yourself this: if your income change is permanent can you live like this with someone who treats you this way? I personally couldn't. I had an ex who literally said \"it's great you make so much when we move cities I won't even need to get a job\". He was gone so fast.

You might even be able to retire early and comfortably if you save enough.\n\nYour BF suffers from short-term thinking, which means he can't envision the great future you're building and wants you to spend your money now. I think your way is better, but you might not be compatible with him.\n\nThat's all to say NTA, and keep being smart with your money.", "So you are making $190,000 more than you were and you can't spend a wee bit of that on a holiday?\n\nTalk about live to work.\n\nYTA", "YTA. If you view your boyfriend as a life partner then I think it's reasonable to share some of your success with him. He's not asking for a new car or anything, he just wants to stay in hotels for a week. And given that you're making almost $200k more a year, that seems very reasonable. \n\nI think the concern of not always having this money is basically a load of BS as well. Maybe you won't always have this specific job but you'll be able to make a lot of money easily as a sys admin for the rest of your life. This isn't an inherently uncertain job like being an athlete or singer or salesman. \n\nBasically your boyfriend is correct that you're being very selfish. If that's how you want to be then ok, it is your money, but I don't think it's a good way to treat a life partner.", "OP you don't have to pay for any fancy vacation if you don't want to. But this is more than that. It's about incompatibility with the change of circumstances and entitlement on his part. \n\nIf you lose your high paying job tomorrow will HE make good of all the money he made you spend on the vacation the way he wanted. I think the answer is NO. \n\nSo decide about the bigger thing now aka finance since money issues are going to crop up frequently from now on with his attitude. \n\nDo you want fight to keep your money and spend it sensibly or indulge in a tug of war with a man who clearly doesn't respect your boundaries.", ">but wouldn't even do the minimum to make our vacation nice.\n\nAbsolutely, Op is describing their ideal vacation and boyfriend is crapping all over it.", "Yeah, OP seriously needs to rethink this relationship. He's a greedy, manipulative, entitled asshole. Anyone wanting to control how you spend your money is a walking red flag.\n\nPlus it's very likely this job is temporary (most startups don't last very long) so saving it to ensure she has a comfortable retirement plus paying off her mortgage is the smartest thing she could do for her future. \n\nAlso, calling HER entitled? Talk about projection.\n\nNTA, obviously.", "NTA.  OP, partners don't get a say in how you spend your money until you're married, and then only if you've mutually agreed to combine finances.  \n\nI'm guessing you may not have noticed that the two of you have different spending habits before because he hasn't had more to spend more.  \n\nAlso very concerning that he is willing to be such a petulant child towards you and that he feels so entitled to your hard-earned money.  \n\nI say this as someone who won't go on holiday with people who want to nickle and dime everything.  \n\nOP, I'd be reconsidering how much I really want to be with this person.  If you're making 310k at a startup, you might not have time for a boyfriend and it sounds like he's only supportive when it benefits him.", "This is it. Dump him, thank him for showing his whole ass so quickly, and find someone sensible and mature like yourself who won\u2019t help himself to YOUR money..", "[removed]", "Exactly..plus I think OP is being really smart with her money here..with the way things are in this current economy, I think being careful about where you spend your money is a necessity.. paying off the debt as soon as you can is what everyone should try to do..so NTA..and if OP wants a future with her bf, then she should have an open and serious discussion about financial priorities so that both of you are on the same page about your spending habits and expectations towards each other..", "I agree with you...the OP sounds at worst \"frugal\" by keeping an eye on spending, not \"cheap\" as she's being accused of by bf.\n\nI may be oversensitive because my Dad did this to my Mom for decades (and still is) but they were married by the time she realized he would find a way to spend all their money while expecting her to keep track of the budget...\n\nHowever, to me a guy who wants to spend someone else's money freaks me out completely, and honestly I don't think I'd continue a relationship.", "Yep. Sadly, I'm not into camping...", "Yeah I know some people like camping but I....don't. If I could only afford a vacation by camping then I might not even go. I enjoy hiking and the outdoors but I want to sleep in a bed and shower every day. I don't think he's totally unreasonable to be like, hey let's upgrade our trip a bit so we don't have to camp now that money isn't an issue. \n\nBut I think he's wrong for the rest of it. it's her house, if she wants to build her own gazebo she should.", "I disagree that they shouldn\u2019t enter the picture before marriage. You need some way to decide how you want to pay for things when you move in together and a plan you agree on for your finances is the kind of thing you should work on before getting married", "Right? I honestly felt offended he was calling it a \"junkyard\" greenhouse. Because I went out of my way to pick through like hundreds of windows at the recycling plant to find that vintage glass with all the cool waves and bubbles in it, vintage stained or embossed glass, and really pretty weathered wood. \n\nI'm also a fan of sustainability so I'll always check out the construction recycling center before the hardware store. \n\nAnd honestly I thought it turned out way prettier and more unique than anything from a kit, but he just saw it as \"cheap\" because it was from reclaimed parts and materials", "OP is selfish....for choosing how to spend their OWN money? When the bf is acting like he can just spend someone elses money? Lol this one sure made me giggle.", "Yup. They are incompatible. OP enjoys camping, he just pretended to enjoy camping until the option came up (in his head) to demand hotels.\n\nAnd then he had the GALL to call her entitled for saying she enjoyed camping? The projection is off the chart. This is not a good dude.", "A year and a half is NOT long enough to feel like you have a say in your partners finances.", "I mean, I am using it. I'm just buying my house from the bank that owns half of it currently, and buying mutual fund stocks. \n\nIt's not like I'm just tossing it in a bank account and doing nothing with it, I'm literally buying the stuff I've dreamed of most (a house owned in full, an early retirement)", "She is going to use it. But she has a longer-term view of how she's going to do that.\n\nI'm 45 and retired last year. Wanna guess how I did that?\n\nBy being more like OP than her bf.", "Why would that be his call though? It's not his money, he doesn't get a \"viewpoint\" about how she's spending it. Especially considering HOW she's spending it. She's preparing for her future, the bf is being selfish and entitled for demanding she spend the money on him.", "Yep. I could be unemployed in a month, a year, etc. \n\nI honestly think it's a big gamble if my job or employer still exists in 2 years honestly, so I really don't want to be getting used to living like I'll always have money to burn\n\nPlus I genuinely love DIY and like the gazebo I built better than any kit I saw for sale, and I genuinely love camping and rock climbing and stuff like that", "That is a fantastic financial decision. Also, the further you are paid down, the better your options to refinance if interest rates crater. You are absolutely being wise, NTA.", "> Honestly the hotels would be pricy, we're road tripping for a month and going to Oregon, California, Washington, etc... And staying near really popular national parks and forests. So we'd easily be going from spending $10-20 a night to $100-200 a night, and that's across a whole month!\n\nIMO, you should add this detail to your post. It provides some much needed context.", "That's a solid plan and you should stay on that course!  Experiences are great too for memories, but it doesn't need to cost big $'s!  Financial security is the best thing you can do at your age.  It will make the rest of your life quite comfortable!"]}
