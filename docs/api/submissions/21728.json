Your fianc\u00e9 is trying to diminish your daughter\u2019s role in your wedding.  I\u2019d be concerned that\u2019ll carry over to other parts of your life too.  Whatever bullshit she means by her not \u201cfitting the part,\u201d sends up huge red flags to me too.\n\nI have kids, and this would be dealbreaker for me.", "NTA. \n\nYou aren\u2019t overreacting at all. It isn\u2019t just S\u2019s wedding, it\u2019s YOUR wedding as a couple. And a joining of families. What an dumb hill for S to die on, but she is showing you who she really is. The fact that S wants to exclude your daughter should tell you all you need to know and how S really feels about your daughter. I think you\u2019re right to reconsider things. How S is treating so now will set the stage for how she will continue to treat her if you marry her. Imagine how S treats your daughter when you aren\u2019t around. Think about that.", "NTA - Be careful, S just showed you her true feelings for P. You want the people who mean the most in your wedding. The fact that your fianc\u00e9e, who I\u2019m guessing is younger than you and this will be her first marriage, doesn\u2019t think your daughter fits that description is extremely telling to me. Even if S gives in, you\u2019ve now seen where your daughter rates in her potential stepmother\u2019s life.  If you choose to ignore this, it won\u2019t be the last time your daughter is left on the outside looking in.", "NTA. She could be a junior bridesmaid if your fiance also wants a younger child in the role of flower girl. \n\nIt's also a possibility to have her stand up with you on the groom's side.\n\nI would be rethinking if I wanted to proceed with marriage to someone who was so adamant about not having my only child in our wedding.

Your daughter is actively involved in your daily lives and should be included if that is what you want. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of crazy for her to think your daughter should not be a part of this major life event.

But yeah, I'd be suspicious of her intentions at this point.", "NTA, and you're a good daddy. If she's marrying you, she's marrying into your family.  That includes your daughter.  The problem is she can't make this one concession for you.  Not only your daughter, but it would make you happy as well.  And she's not willing.  It's your wedding too.

She can pretend to be nice in front of you and a total b to your daughter behind closed doors. The mask is slipping already.

You weren't even asking daughter to replace niece as THE flower girl.  All you asked is that daughter be A flower girl along with niece, or otherwise be in the wedding.\n\nPlus, fianc\u00e9e will be daughter's stepmom.  Great that she has a great relationship with niece, but shouldn't she be working towards an even stronger relationship with her stepdaughter?\n\nYou could have been a bit smoother, but you have your daughter's back.  I would also be having second thoughts about marrying someone who doesn't want to include my daughter in our wedding, or who only included her grudgingly.  So watch out for that -- are you sure fianc\u00e9e and your daughter really have a good relationship, or is it one-sided?  Bc if fianc\u00e9e can't articulate any better reason than that daughter doesn't \"fit the part,\" that's not a reason at all.

It seems she wants to marry you, but not have a relationship with your daughter.
