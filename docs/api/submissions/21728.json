Your fianc\u00e9 is trying to diminish your daughter\u2019s role in your wedding.  I\u2019d be concerned that\u2019ll carry over to other parts of your life too.  Whatever bullshit she means by her not \u201cfitting the part,\u201d sends up huge red flags to me too.\n\nI have kids, and this would be dealbreaker for me.", "NTA. \n\nYou aren\u2019t overreacting at all. It isn\u2019t just S\u2019s wedding, it\u2019s YOUR wedding as a couple. And a joining of families. What an dumb hill for S to die on, but she is showing you who she really is. The fact that S wants to exclude your daughter should tell you all you need to know and how S really feels about your daughter. I think you\u2019re right to reconsider things. How S is treating so now will set the stage for how she will continue to treat her if you marry her. Imagine how S treats your daughter when you aren\u2019t around. Think about that.", "NTA - Be careful, S just showed you her true feelings for P. You want the people who mean the most in your wedding. The fact that your fianc\u00e9e, who I\u2019m guessing is younger than you and this will be her first marriage, doesn\u2019t think your daughter fits that description is extremely telling to me. Even if S gives in, you\u2019ve now seen where your daughter rates in her potential stepmother\u2019s life.  If you choose to ignore this, it won\u2019t be the last time your daughter is left on the outside looking in.", "NTA. She could be a junior bridesmaid if your fiance also wants a younger child in the role of flower girl. \n\nIt's also a possibility to have her stand up with you on the groom's side.\n\nI would be rethinking if I wanted to proceed with marriage to someone who was so adamant about not having my only child in our wedding.

Your daughter is actively involved in your daily lives and should be included if that is what you want. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of crazy for her to think your daughter should not be a part of this major life event.

But yeah, I'd be suspicious of her intentions at this point.", "NTA, and you're a good daddy. If she's marrying you, she's marrying into your family.  That includes your daughter.  The problem is she can't make this one concession for you.  Not only your daughter, but it would make you happy as well.  And she's not willing.  It's your wedding too. Really contemplate if this is the person you want to spend your life with. If she's willing to exclude your daughter now, the only direction is down after this.

I would try counseling with all three of you and maybe even a few couple sessions before going through with it.", "NTA.

She can pretend to be nice in front of you and a total b to your daughter behind closed doors. The mask is slipping already.

Great that she has a great relationship with niece, but shouldn't she be working towards an even stronger relationship with her stepdaughter?\n\nYou could have been a bit smoother, but you have your daughter's back.  I would also be having second thoughts about marrying someone who doesn't want to include my daughter in our wedding, or who only included her grudgingly.  So watch out for that -- are you sure fianc\u00e9e and your daughter really have a good relationship, or is it one-sided?  Bc if fianc\u00e9e can't articulate any better reason than that daughter doesn't \"fit the part,\" that's not a reason at all.

My husband had his brother be his best man when he was 16, and we just had a different groomsman sign the marriage license.", "They don't really have to do anything. The married couple just needs adult witnesses, which it sounds like there will be plenty. I think the spot of the best person signing as witness is just tradition.", "This isn\u2019t true (at least in UK), I was my fathers best man when I was 17, it was a bit unfortunate because I couldn\u2019t partake in much of the stag-do etc, and I didn\u2019t sign anything (like you say, age requirement), however it meant more than the world to me that despite these facts, he still chose me.", "Groomsgirl it is then!", "I remember that one. And she and her adult daughter were not working and sponging off dad.", "Or she could be down playing what really happens when they are alone or how she is treated or feels about S because she's daddy's girlfriend and he seems to be happy and why ruin that", "That\u2019s exactly what that says though? Guests aren\u2019t \u201cin the wedding\u201d, they attend it. In this context OP isn\u2019t saying physically at the wedding, but a part of the wedding party. The ones \u201cin the wedding\u201d are the bride/groom, bridesmaids, groomsmen, etc.\n\nOP wants his daughter to play some role, and it sounds like his fianc\u00e9e does not. She wants her to be a guest, but not part of the ceremony. That\u2019s where the contention lies.", "I was wondering that too. Jumping straight to \"But I will look pretty\" shows that OP and his ex wife need to have a careful conversation about what S says to this little girl.", "Yep. Ours was 7.", "There are 7 billion humans on the planet and you have accomplished the rare deed of a completely unique idea.\n\nDon't know if it's a good thing, but it got a chuckle out of me at least.", "Omg! That sounds so awesome.", "Ohh! Well that works then.", "Fuck that. When you marry someone with kids you know what you are getting into, its a package deal, and why the fuck would you want to marry someone who would even think about being put first. Kids do not ask to be born. They are solely dependent on their parents to meet their needs. KIDS come first point blank.", "Congrats on making the most ridiculous comment on the entire intenet! There's not a lot of things the entire world agrees on, but here's one: kids always, always, always come first.", "What in the horse shit is this comment?! My kids come first, over and above me or my partner. Oldest 2 kids aren\u2019t his, he puts them over and above me and him because they are kids. My kids, his kids, our kids. We both put the kids first, then it\u2019s us.", "What sort of medieval bs is that? \n\nAs long as kids are minors, they come first in all decision making - they are literally dependent on their parents for life, safety and comfort. And when the kid is his from before even he met his fiancee, the kid comes first even in thought; if she didn't know that, *she* shouldn't get married.\n\nAnd yeah, I have read all your arguments in this thread, none hold water.", "Please never have kids. They should ALWAYS come first.", "Thanks for admitting that people with kids are second-tier partners.  Why the FUCK would any self-respecting person sign up for a life of being second-priority?", "If kid comes first, then stay single or keep it casual.", "You\u2019re emotional lol.", "Bullshit. \n\nKids come before all parents. You do what is best for your kids. \n\nS can put her niece before but somehow her fiance's child should come after? \n\n\nBullshit", "Aren't most people without kids also \"second-tier partners\", if all it takes is having people who matter to you slightly more than your partner?\n\n>Why the FUCK would any self-respecting person sign up for a life of being second-priority?\n\nI can't imagine being self involved enough to expect to be anyone's first priority. And if they had kids, I would be a little disgusted if they put me before their children!", "Maybe you could give an example of what you mean?", "Bc they know what they are getting into. They willingly sign up for that. You should WANT them to prioritize the kids they chose to bring into this world, are a part of them, and dependent on them. Any good parent should prioritize their child, and loving them means that isn\u2019t a problem. It shouldn\u2019t bother someone unless they are selfish, and its okay to be selfish, but in that case don\u2019t get with someone who has children. Any one who loves their children that much is a good person, and that should be applauded, and show their character", "If the kid comes second to you don't reproduce. You'll only be doing everyone a disfavour", "I\u2019m really not. But crack on.", "THIS! Before, your fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t think she was in a position to remove your daughter. The first moment she got her feet under the table, she first move was to remove your daughter from her future with you. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 only tolerated your daughter when she felt she had no choice but to tolerate her.", "You need to consider that she was hiding who she truly was until you were \u2018hooked\u2019. Now you\u2019ve proposed she may feel safe to start showing you who she is. Be careful. These subs are littered with stories from kids who\u2019ve cut off a parent who picked their SO over the child. Don\u2019t make the same mistake.", "You have great instincts, and have been - fortuitously - shown how exactly she thinks of your daughter: as somebody outside of your wedding. \n\nI would also be concerned that she has masked her real feelings for so long, strung along you and your child, instead of being up front about it. This is not just being sneaky; it is long term manipulation", "Not bullshit, but keep getting mad lol.  Don\u2019t get married and expect your spouse to play second fiddle to your kid.  Ain\u2019t gonna happen. \n\nWhom did S put her niece before?", "Hard agree. That expectation is gonna be someones downfall. How entitled.", "No. People without kids are able to give their all to the relationship.   Expecting to be your significant other\u2019s first priority isn\u2019t \u201cself-involved\u201d; it\u2019s how relationships work.  You\u2019ve got a weird take here.", "1.Breaking plans with the spouse in order to do something with the child.  \n\n2.  Spending Xmas (holidays) with child and ex (to preserve family dynamic) and leaving spouse to spend it with other people.", "Then don\u2019t get married until the kid is close to adulthood. Can\u2019t have it both ways.", "Getting mad and calling a comment \u201chorseshit\u201d is unquestionably an emotional response.", "That's a big fucking NOPE.", "Breaking plans should be indeed not be a regular occurrence no matter with who you are making plans. Of course there are exceptions like illness or emergencies. But in regard of holidays I don't get why some people think, seperated people should never see each other again except to swich kids? I find it oretty healthy to set aside differences to give the kids some normality with both parents at the same time. I am pretty sure there are compromises to do in all these instances. Nothing is black and white.", "That\u2019s a big fucking YEP.", "Nothing wrong with seeing the ex during holidays\u2026but not to the exclusion of the new spouse."]}
