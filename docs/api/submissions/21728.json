It isn\u2019t just S\u2019s wedding, it\u2019s YOUR wedding as a couple. And a joining of families. What an dumb hill for S to die on, but she is showing you who she really is. The fact that S wants to exclude your daughter should tell you all you need to know and how S really feels about your daughter. I think you\u2019re right to reconsider things. How S is treating so now will set the stage for how she will continue to treat her if you marry her. Imagine how S treats your daughter when you aren\u2019t around. Think about that.", "NTA - Be careful, S just showed you her true feelings for P. You want the people who mean the most in your wedding. The fact that your fianc\u00e9e, who I\u2019m guessing is younger than you and this will be her first marriage, doesn\u2019t think your daughter fits that description is extremely telling to me. Even if S gives in, you\u2019ve now seen where your daughter rates in her potential stepmother\u2019s life.  If you choose to ignore this, it won\u2019t be the last time your daughter is left on the outside looking in.", "NTA. She could be a junior bridesmaid if your fiance also wants a younger child in the role of flower girl. \n\nIt's also a possibility to have her stand up with you on the groom's side.\n\nI would be rethinking if I wanted to proceed with marriage to someone who was so adamant about not having my only child in our wedding.

Your daughter is actively involved in your daily lives and should be included if that is what you want. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of crazy for her to think your daughter should not be a part of this major life event.

Bc if fianc\u00e9e can't articulate any better reason than that daughter doesn't \"fit the part,\" that's not a reason at all.

Your daughter does not need that kind of influence, especially as she is coming up to a very unerable and impressionable age. This could wreck her self-esteem.  Additional note.

Now that you put a ring on her and she feels more secure, she feels she has more power in the relationship her attitude immediately shifted and strated to treat your daughter worse, already started to push the line further back about what treatment is acceptable. She slipped and pushed too much too suddenly, so now it's damage control mode using her mom to pressure you to look past this, to keep the ring on. If you go through with this marriage, put the second ring on her too, she will escalate more (because once the marriage certificate is signed she is harder to get rid of and she knows that) and turn into an evil stepmom, and if you two plan to have a kid together then escalate even further. \n\nIf you two plan to have kids together, after this, do you really believe that she wouldn't treat them better than your daughter, that she wouldn't make your daughter feel like an outcast? Or if you don't plan to have kids, do you really think after this that there won't be other situations where she wants to exclude your daughter, when she will treat her like an outcast?\n\nI suggest you to at least put the breaks on the wedding. Think through whether you want your daughter to be treated the way your fianc\u00e9e showed you her expectations about where your daughter's place is and have a long conversation alone with your daughter about how she was treated before, how she is treated now, what kind of things your fianc\u00e9e says to her (little kids and even 10-11 yrs olds are often deaf to sarcasm), what she thinks of your fianc\u00e9e, ask your daughter if she ever asked her to keep something secret from you, what's that secret is and make sure to tell her she can always tell you everything and it's important to have honesty between the two of you and it's important that she tells you if someone asks her to keep a secret, etc. when your fianc\u00e9e is not home to interrupt or overhear. Ask your ex about what your daughter told her about your fianc\u00e9e too! And think about whether you want to be treated like this too, like your opinion and wants are less important than hers, having your MIL meddle in your relationship problems by scolding, berating you etc.\n\nIf you go through with the wedding only do it with a prenup and a will (about your assets, family heirloom and other sentimental objects too) already in place, so you can protect your daughter and your daughter's inheritance with them in case something happens to you, because in almost all cases when evil stepmoms get a hold of the inheritance then the stepkids won't see any of it ever again, not even sentimental objects. \n\nTo me your fianc\u00e9e's behaviour would be a big red flag and I would be rethinking the whole relationship. She showed you that she doesn't love your daughter. This treatment is probably not a first and even more likely not the last or just an odd one out. Her behaviour is coming from somewhere... And behaviour like this escalates in 99.999% of the cases after the wedding. \n\n(You know how statistics say that domestic violence against women escalates after they get married / loose their job so financially dependant on the man /get pregnant / give birth... when they get more vulnerable and/or when it's harder to get out of the relationship.

Except my one teen nephew who was very into clothes (still is!) who wore a velvet tailcoat with his mohawk. The girls all got pretty and age-appropriate dresses.

And even when they had kids (I was 17 then), they always referred to my bed as \u201cOneOfManyAnts\u2019 bed\u201d even when it was actually my brother\u2019s full-time bed.

It's an awesome, positive feeling when you learn it the easy way, and you're happy you dodged a bullet. But it's a very sad and devastating thing to learn it the hard way, and you're devastated as to why you ignored the signs, or the red flags that you recognized yet ignored or the style and manner in which way the other person's game was played.

In the best possible scenario here, S needs a reality check, pronto, and will come to terms with the fact that her Barbie Dream Wedding was just a fantasy with props and stand-ins. Hopefully, she will have the self-awareness to understand that her real wedding day will be so much more special when she accounts for the actual marriage she's starting with it. And makes things right by giving P a role in it.\n\nAlso OP, there is nothing preventing you from including P as one of your side of the party. And it's a good way to check her reaction and learn more about conflict in your relationship. I have been to weddings where there were women on the groom's side--both in tuxes and in dresses, including one with a \"Best Gal\" (who looked AMAZING in a tailored suit and heels).\n\nMake your daughter part of your side of the wedding party, with a very pretty dress (or a suit if she prefers) that matches or complements the colors of the bridesmaids. Your fianc\u00e9e's reaction will tell you if this is just a disappointing burp or a real red flag. Good luck.", "This!!!

On top of that she made sure to include him and I in all of the family photos, totally unprompted by me or my partner. I had no preconceived notions about how that day would go. If anything I thought it would go more the opposite - my son and I giving them their space for family photos, etc. \n\nInstead it was overwhelmingly beautiful how much she made us feel included despite the fact that her brother and I are not conventionally married. All this to say, I am so grateful for how my SIL acted that day and I couldn't even begin to imagine how it would feel if my partner and I were getting married and he decided outright that our son would play no part in it. \n\nShe isnt marrying just him, she is marrying him and the daughter.", "this one op!! \u201cfit the part!\u201d wtf!?!? if she was decent partner she should have immediately suggested your daughter being a junior bridesmaid or whatever else without a single hesitation! the fact she\u2019s already excluding her I cannot imagine down the line how she is going to treat your daughter.

Yayyy! So happy for you!\u201d We got by for a while with the understanding that I want absolutely nothing to do with her.

I\u2019m the evil stepmom (muahahaha) and sure we just went to the courthouse in a cute little scenic nearby tourist town, but you bet your ass my precious stepson was there in the middle of it all. He held my hand and his daddy\u2019s hand when we said our vows in the little courthouse room and we went and got ice cream and candy and got lunch together as a family after. He was 5 and it was a huge deal for him and for us for him to be there with us.

She sees them as a family. She sees herself, rightfully, as an integral member of that family. This isn\u2019t about a wedding.

My instincts are saying if fianc\u00e9 is willing to act this way in front of you then there is stuff you aren\u2019t seeing.
