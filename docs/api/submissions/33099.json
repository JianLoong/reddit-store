You\u2019re not right or wrong, but she will hold on to that resentment if it isn\u2019t dealt with.\n\nTake her to something special to make up for leaving her behind.", "I mean, technically NTA but.....\n\nThat is pretty cold. You knew your partner wanted to see this band as much as you did. You essentially said \"sorry bout your luck, ttyl!\"\n\nMuch as it may have sucked for you, the responsible thing would have been to decline and hang with your partner. Again, NTA, but depending on how important this event was to your partner, you may not have to worry about them much longer.", "YTA because you have bad communication skills. Right thing to do was to ask your partner if she\u2019s cool with it, a partner would want you to go if you could rather than having to miss it but the key is communication. Going without even talking to her just makes you seem selfish.\n\nSo while you\u2019re NTA for going, it\u2019s bad communication skills on your part and depending on how much she cares, you\u2019re unreliable.", "Nah but she and her friends are going to think you are\n\nThats self centered and far be it for me to call someone else for being self centered but yeah it is what it is\n\nSuch is life man", "NTA, although I can see where she would be envious and therefore a little resentful. But it wasn\u2019t a planned thing and the only other rational alternative is that you BOTH miss the concert. \n\nI feel like this is one of those things that it\u2019s perfectly natural to feel mad about in the moment, but once rationality has a chance to weigh in she should realize making you miss out too isn\u2019t a better alternative.\n\nNow, if you had plans with her that night and ditched her to go to the concert without even asking how she feels about it\u2026then yikes.", "I understand her annoyance and envy, but I strongly believe that people who love you will be happy when good things happen to you. If they can only be happy if good things happen to them, that's a big red flag in my book. \n\nYou didn't go buy yourself one ticket and leave her home. You got offered a last minute ticket, that's an important distinction. \n\nN-T-A, pending one question: If she got offered the ticket and went, would you have been upset?", "You kind of are the AH. Since your ticket was free, couldn't you have gone halves with her on another ticket so you could have both gone?", "NAH but understandable she is disappointed! Some situations you don\u2019t have to be an asshole for feelings to be hurt. I would like to say she should have been happy for you, but some people have strong attachments with music and maybe she was too bummed out to be happy for you in the moment.\n\nI think exception would be if she was clearly more into this band than you. If it was her favourite band she introduced you to, or one that was particularly special to your relationship it may sting a bit more- but still I think you are NTA!!", "NAH, but you are going to pay for this one.", "Yeah. This relationship isn\u2019t going to last. No. Not really TAH. But just speaks to your priorities. If you passed up time you could have spent with her, at the show or not, then you\u2019re not that committed to her. If she\u2019s willing to forgive, then good for you. If not, hope you enjoyed it!", "YTA - that was not nice at all. I get why you did it, but yeah, you\u2019re TA.", "NTA. You were offered a free ticket to a band you liked too. I would've grabbed the opportunity. I get why your SO is envious, but taking advantage of a good fortune doesn't make you a bad person.", "Technically NTA, but you\u2019re a dick. You know how much seeing them meant, you didn\u2019t care.", "YTA, Ima agree with others and say that this probably won\u2019t last unless you guys start communicating better. My answer would have been after getting off the phone to talk to my wife and say hey I just got invited with a free ticket what do you think would you mind if I go? Want to see if now since we only have to buy one ticket we can afford to get you one? Knowing my wife she\u2019d probably be cool with me going as I would do the same for her but the fact is we would talk about it and not just assume we can leave the other one alone for the night while the other person goes to something both wanted to go too.", "Was the show sold out? If you got a free ticket, then the two of you could've split the cost of a ticket for her perhaps?", "NTA in my opinion. If you\u2019d bought your own ticket knowing she couldn\u2019t afford one and went without her, that\u2019d be one thing. \n\nBut a chance thing where someone offers a free ticket last minute, I\u2019d tell my bf go and have fun. I\u2019d be sad to not get to go but that doesn\u2019t mean he should have to miss out too. I think she should want her partner to go have a nice time.", "Wild how many people call this a dick move, but I guess me and my husband of a decade are a couple of dicks. We\u2019ve been in similar situations a bunch, not necessarily with a concert, but different traveling and experience opportunities and we\u2019ve always encouraged each other to seize these moments. Can the person left behind be a little sad? Yes. Can you be kind and not rub it in their face and think of ways to share the experience? Also, yes. \n\nOverall, y\u2019all need to find supportive relationships where you\u2019re not attached at hip. Be independent and love happiness and joy for each other. NTA", "NAH\n\nNo sense in you passing up the opportunity, but I completely understand why your partner was sour about it. Hopefully they were also a little happy for you as well.", "NTA You took advantage of a free opportunity to go and see a band you enjoy. I can understand why SO would be bummed out, but they\u2019re also kinda TA for not being happy that you got to go knowing how much you wanted to. \n\nNow if you kept bragging, rubbing it in their face and talking about it after the fact, then absolutely YTA.", "INFO NEEDED. Did you guys have any kind of pack or agreement that you'd only see the band together.", "I wouldn\u2019t want to be with a person that couldn\u2019t be happy for me. I would want someone that can be happy and also know I would do the same if the shoe were on the other foot", "NTA but it does suck she couldn\u2019t go too. I\u2019d be a little jealous too tbh but outright mad? Nah", "NTA", "So he should have done what? Declined so neither of them can go, or offer her the ticket so he doesn't get to go?", "NTA, and I can't understand all the YTAs saying it was a dick move bc she loves the band too. If I had a partner who got Hozier tickets when I didn't, yeah, I'd be jealous and disappointed, but I'd be stoked for them too. I can't imagine thinking my partner shouldn't go just bc I can't-that sounds really cruel to me. If you love your partner, aren't you supposed to be happy when something good happens to them? Wishing for them to be miserable just bc you are is such a red flag to me; there's no way that way of thinking is healthy.", "YTA. you went to see one of her favorite bands without her. i don\u2019t see her being your partner for much longer if these are the types of decisions you make.", "That was really selfish of you though to go and not even think about your partner. If that was my husband he would have insisted on offering me the ticket rather than just going himself and not giving me a choice. That may explain why we've been together happily for thirty years and why your relationship may possibly be coming to an end soon.", "NTA- technically\u2026 if it was me I\u2019d be upset it was offered to the other person not me  but I\u2019d also understand their friends not mine\u2026 Tho I\u2019d be curious how there was suddenly an extra ticket at the last minute and unless someone suddenly fell sick 20 minutes before the doors opened I\u2019d probably be questioning if it was done on purpose and whether the friends like me\u2026", "YTA for knowing it would upset your partner and disregarding their feelings.", "Tbh it was an opportunity and your gf was selfish. NTA", "NAH\n\nIt was an unexpected gift to you so you're not an AH for going.\n\nBut I think you should've been more considerate. Either by asking if you could give the ticket to your partner or just not go at all so you both miss out.", "NTA \n\nIt SUCKS that the plans didn\u2019t work out in a way that would allow her to go, and sure it would be nice to stay, but you shouldn\u2019t have to miss out because she couldn\u2019t go. \n\nShe\u2019s also not wrong for being upset about it. If at all possible, you should really take her out for a special 1-on-1 day filled with all her favorite things to make up for it. \n\nI\u2019m sure if the situations were reversed you\u2019d be feeling just as down. MAYBE, happy that your partner could go but also sad and pissed that they left you behind to a place you can\u2019t follow (but really really really want to).", "YTA\n\nIt's a dick move. You couldn't afford it either. But a free ticket came up. So....fuck your partners feelings?", "You could have made your so super happy and offered her the ticket? If your friend know her and she would have been comfortable going with them\nYou would have missed it yourself but it would have been like the best gift ever", "NTA. Suuuuper NTA. I don't usually comment, but I feel like I'm on crazy pills rn or something, the way this thread is so off the rails.\n\nThere was an event that both of you wanted to go to. Neither of you originally could go. You got the chance to go. I'm 100% going to catch flak from the people making wild takes here, but in a healthy, mature, relationship, your partner would be happy for you and encourage you to go. In a partnership, we celebrate each other, and celebrate each others' wins.\n\nIf I were your partner, of course I would be disappointed that I didn't get to go, but in that hypothetical, I was already not going. I was already going to be disappointed. At least this way, one of y'all gets to see your one of favorite artists.\n\nAlso, how weird would it be for your friend if you gave the ticket to your gf? Like your friend wanted to go to the show with you/do you a solid, specifically.\n\nI would change from NTA to soft/hard YTA if any of the following were true:\n\n* Not getting to go was a big enough deal for you/your gf that you had made alternative plans to make up for it, like going to karaoke to sing that artist's songs or something. Also no bueno if you had a nice date planned. But if y'all were just planning on chilling at home, no foul.     \n* It's super rare to have the chance to see the band. e.g. kpop group that rarely tours USA, band's final tour etc. But then I'd also be more firm on GFITA for not supporting/being happy for you.  \n* The friend offering was your gf's friend before they were your friend  \n* Your gf could have gone, but didn't because you couldn't afford a ticket  \n\nOf course, it'd be great if you could have split a ticket (maybe it's too pricey for you both to get tickets, but not for both of you to get half a ticket?) but since it was so last-minute, that might have been hard. I'm sure gf would've appreciated the effort. Also, picking up some merch to give to gf would've been a nice touch, too.\n\nAll that said, not great gf is giving you a hard time for this. If a partner got a personalized opportunity to do something we both wanted to do, I would be happy for them, not mad they didn't give it to me. That would be really entitled and selfish of me to expect. Why would my needs supersede my partners for something we both enjoy (and when the opportunity came to them through no effort of my own).\n\nINFO: how old are y'all? How long have y'all been going out for?", "YTA - ohana means family, family means no one is left behind\nDidn\u2019t you watch Lilo & Stitch?", "NTA Your partner can grow up. Sometimes you don't get to do things other people do. YOUR FRIEND offering YOU a free ticket last minute isn't being selfish.", "NAH, but there's a lot of people probably not in relationships telling you how yours should work in the comments", "NTA but......this is one of those things your partner will never forget or let go of. My suggestion would be next time think long and hard about if it's worth it to go. Maybe start planning now to surprise your partner with a trip to see them for both of you. Save like crazy so you can afford it.", "Probably not the AH, but I would have definitely kept it quite.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
