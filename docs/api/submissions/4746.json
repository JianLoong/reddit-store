I live with roommates in my own apartment. My parents live in a large house and they own several animals: two dogs, three cats and a bird. \n\nBefore moving out I was always very fatigued and got sick frequently. Every month I\u2019d come down with a sinus or ear infection and I ended up missing several weeks of school each year. Miraculously, I graduated with good grades and got a scholarship to a college out of state. When I moved out, all my illnesses disappeared and I became healthier than ever. On a hunch, I decided to take an allergy test and turns out I\u2019m extremely allergic to dogs. \n\nSince moving out I\u2019ve visited my parents on special occasions, mostly for thanksgiving and Christmas. Since I live in a pet-free apartment, my allergies are normally never a problem. However, each time I visit my parents, they hit me like a truck. My parents do their best to keep the house clean: they keep the animals out of my room, they clean before I come, they bathe the dogs, etc. I too, do everything I can; I take allergy medicine daily, I get allergy shots, and I don\u2019t touch the animals while I\u2019m there. Yet I still struggle to breathe and get very poor sleep over each holiday. \n\nThis thanksgiving was the most disappointing so far. I\u2019d gotten to a high dose of allergy shots and my parents had done the deepest clean yet, and I was still miserable. When I returned home, I got very sick for a week after but recovered.\n\nYesterday I got an email for a plane ticket that my parents had purchased for me. I\u2019d be leaving this weekend and returning right before new years, almost two weeks at my parents house. I called my father and told him that while I am extremely grateful for the ticket, and that I love him, I don\u2019t think I can spend time at their place again. I told him how sick I\u2019d gotten after I returned home and how miserable I\u2019d felt over thanksgiving. \n\nMy father got very upset and began crying. He never cries. He told me he misses me and that this ticket is non refundable. Through tears, I told him I\u2019m sorry, but I couldn\u2019t risk my health anymore and I don\u2019t have the money to stay at a hotel. Neither does he. I hung up before he could say anything more. \n\nI haven\u2019t heard from him or any other family all day. I\u2019m starting to think I made a mistake.

It's difficult for them if they miss you but they shouldn't have bought a ticket without consulting you. You can't be expected to put yourself through this.", "NTA. Why hasn\u2019t your family offered to come see you for the holidays instead? There has to be some compromise here; you can\u2019t keep risking your own health just to make them happy.", "NTA. Your health is very important. It\u2019s unfortunate about the plane ticket, but they should have had a conversation about it before buying it.  You can let them know you miss them too, but visits will have to be elsewhere from now on.", "NAH. \n\nYou have a legit medical issue every time you go home, and it's entirely reasonable for them to want you home for Christmas. Tbh if you can't face the allergies for Christmas, it sounds like you never plan on visiting your parents ever again.\n\n>I don\u2019t have the money to stay at a hotel. Neither does he.\n\nThis is the part you guys have to figure out how to afford, because it seems like the only solution.", "NAH, I think the main problem here is that your dad didn\u2019t talk to you first. I understand his POV entirely since the ticket isn\u2019t refundable and he would obviously love to have you home for the holidays, but you don\u2019t want to compromise your health. Both of these are valid. Maybe see if you can make it up partially to your dad in some way and in the future make sure he communicates about buying plane tickets for you before he does it.", "NTA but Op, tell your parents to get their HVAC vents cleaned if they haven't done it. There's probably ton of hair, dust, and dander in the vents", "NAH. They shouldn't have bought a ticket without even asking you, and you JUST saw them for Thanksgiving so it's not like you've been away for years without seeing them. They need to either come visit you, save up some money to put you up at a hotel or figure something else out because being miserably sick every time you visit home just sounds deeply shitty, and two months in a row is a bit much, especially when there are other options.\n\nIf you really want to make it work are there any other family/close family friends in their general neighborhood that you might be able to stay with or something?\n\nEdit: Changed vote from N T A to NAH (which I sometimes forget about). I mean I don't think they should have bought the ticket first without asking, but it doesn't sound like he was necessarily trying to guilt trip you, just sad, and it's understandable they would want to see you. As it stands now I'd say it's a NAH situation, but if they start piling on the guilt or something it could change.", "NTA. I\u2019ve had life threatening allergies and asthma since I was 5. I knew what made me ill. I grew up on a farm. That\u2019s all we had. My family couldn\u2019t have changed. We were literally dirt poor. Knowing that, NTA ever. Your health is your #1 priority. These allergies could turn deadly any time. I\u2019ve been intubated over 30 times. My father quit counting when I was in 2nd grade. Your situation could turn deadly at any time. You need to avoid dogs and you cannot go back to your parents unless you have a minimum of an epi pen, a nebulizer, Benadryl. That\u2019s just to walk in the front door. \n\nI can visit people that have animals that I\u2019m allergic to. This is what I do. I wear a hat. I wear clothing and as soon as I leave the home and go to where I\u2019m staying, I takeoff all my clothes and immediately into a shower, preferably from the garage. Wash from top to bottom first pass to get all the allergens off you. Do not touch your eyes, ever. You can wear a face mask like an N 95 that will keep some of the dander from going into your mouth and nose. You can also wear goggles over your eyes. I have done both to visit family and it worked. I may have looked weird but I was able to visit for them for half an hour and then I was done. This is seriously the only way you can visit your parents again and I\u2019m only talking a half hour at a time. I know I sound over the top. I\u2019m 56 and have been dealing with this for 51 years. I\u2019ve had 3 rounds of allergy shots. I use a daily inhaler, plus a nebulizer as needed. Daily allergy pill plus Benadryl as needed. It\u2019s a shitty world, the allergy life but you can survive. I wish you luck. Please show your parents my response if they still don\u2019t understand.", "NAH. Your parents want to see you and are trying their best to make reasonable accommodations for your allergies but unfortunately it's not enough to protect your health.", "NAH your health is important AND it\u2019s sad you can\u2019t go to your parents\u2019 place without getting majorly ill. Are there any family friends without dogs who might let you crash with them and visit with your parents during the day/outside (weather permitting)/for meals etc? I\u2019m sure y\u2019all will eventually find a solution that works. While it may not happen soon enough for you to use these tickets, it won\u2019t be forever. \ud83d\udc9a", "NAH.

It might be worth checking out.", "NTA\n\nI understand your parents wanting to see you.   Is there some kind of compromise you can do in order to see them?

You can stay for less days if help to fund a person or more than one person. Another thing you can try is delay your ticket and you and your parents can save money to place the dogs in a hotel during your next visit. Removing the dogs from the house during your stay may help to your allergy don't be so severe.", "Fair, but just keep it in mind if you really feel bad with your parents not seeing you at all.
