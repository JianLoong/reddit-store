From March to October I work insane hours. Average 12 hours a day, usually in split shifts with a siesta in the afternoon, where usually I come home, eat, have a power nap, then back to work. This month I will do even more hours than usual as August is peak tourist season. On the upside, in the winter I don't need to work because I make all my money in the season, and my wife doesn't need to work at all. \n\nDue to my unusual schedule, and after my own family came to visit for 2 long weeks four years ago, I decided that having guests in our house for more than a week is just too much during the season (in winter I'm fine with it). My work load, plus having people staying that are on vacation is just too much for me. I need my downtime or I burn out. A week I enjoy, but any more and I start just getting frustrated and need my personal space back. \n\n\nMy wife has some friends coming to stay first week of September for 4 nights and I'm really looking forward to it. I know these girls, and they are great fun, our kind of people. No problem. \n\nThe other night, my wife said that her brother, his wife and their toddler will come and stay the last 2 weeks of September and I was a bit confused, as we had discussed our maximum one week strategy many times before. I said that I'd love to have them for a week and reminded my wife that we already have guests a week before that. \n\nMy wife starts to get upset with me and says 10 days. I remind her that they also have an 18 month old, our house is far from child friendly (we are child free) and that it will be just too much for me right at the end of the season. She thinks I'm being an AH because her brother needs a summer beach vacation and we haven't spent a lot of time with them since the baby was born, which is all true. \n\nI do really like BIL and his family, but also, they do not really speak much English and I don't speak their language, so it takes even more energy to deal with that from my side. \n\nSo reddit, WIBTA for enforcing the one week stay rule, or should I cave and keep the peace to my own detriment? My wife is pretty upset with me about it. \n\nBring on the judgement.\n\n\nEdit: so many great perspectives, sorry if I don't answer right now.

It\u2019s unfair of your wife to back out of your very reasonable agreement - she wants to prioritize her brother & his family over your needs and your previous agreement. \n\nCould you suggest that her brother still come, but not stay at your house? Or only stay at your house for a few days? Of course this would be more expensive for him, but would allow him to vacation and for her to spend time with him and his family while still respecting your agreement and needs.", "NTA she shouldn\u2019t have just announced what would be happening. You both had an agreement. I know what it\u2019s like to be drained from working ridiculous hours. Perhaps since she doesn\u2019t work, she doesn\u2019t understand that. I think a week is plenty.\n\n> She thinks I'm being an AH because her brother needs a summer beach vacation\n\nThat\u2019s not a need, it\u2019s a want.\n\nHopefully she\u2019ll come around. Two weeks with a baby is a lot, even if it wasn\u2019t in the middle of your busy time.", "NTA.  You made a very reasonable agreement that your wife should be abiding by.  It'd be a little different if there was a true emergency and they needed help but a vacation is not enough justification to put your physical and mental health at risk.  Depending on what your business is, could be a liability to not be fully alert and functional from lack of sleep/burning out", "WNBTA, the week rule was already established prior to this situation. She needs to respect that and your busy work schedule. Hosting is exhausting!", "NTA, he does not NEED a summer beach vacation", "NTA. Your work is your livelihood, and it is seasonal. You have to concentrate to get it done, and I would imagine you could lose out on future work if you are too tired and distracted to do it well. Put your foot down. Your wife can apologize to her brother for jumping ahead to invite he and his family before checking with you. I mean, most adults can understand that when you don't go to a person's place of business and endanger their work life, right? Home is your place of business. They can visit in winter if they want to spend more than one week.", "YWNBTA. Tell your wife 2 weeks is fine as long as they start their stay **after** the crazy tourist season.", "NTA I have lived in a tourist destination and I agree that two weeks is too long, this boundary has been in place, and that\u2019s a lot of guests in a row. Her brother may think you\u2019re an asshole though, depending on whether they\u2019ve already booked flights, etc. But really, that\u2019s on your wife for making you the asshole and not expressing the boundary to her brother. The other thing is, 10 days is neither 1 week or 2 weeks, but it IS closer to one week. If you allow it this time, that\u2019s up to you, but I\u2019d make it known there will be no exceptions going forward where she can set you up to be the asshole.", "NTA In my community we have a saying that goes like this...\"Houseguests are like fish, they stink after 3 days\". I wouldn't want them for more than a week either.", "Wnbta my friend, \n\nAt the end of the day you know your limits and have discussed them and made agreements based on them that have done well for years now. You\u2019re still fine with 7 days, is 7 days not enough for a vacation? Could they not stay elsewhere after those 7 days are up? I mean that\u2019s still a whole week of no hotel fees", "NTA. This seems reasonable considering all the work you'll be doing that season. Your wife is the AH though, for telling her brother and his family that they can stay without consulting you.", "NAH, enforce your rule definitely, but try to be creative in thinking up potential compromises. Can they visit 1 week with you, a few days somewhere else, then back to you for the weekend before flying home? Can they come for the last week in October and first week in November - it'll still be warm, right?", "NTA - it\u2019s so stressful having people stay with you, especially if it\u2019s during your busy season.", "NAH\n\nI don't think either of you are AHs. I think this is a legitimate and unfortunate quandary that is probably worth compromising over.\n\nYou aren't an AH for your boundary. It's a very reasonable one. You have an intense and exhausting work schedule during this part of the year, and having been to that part of the world in summertime (my sister also lives in a Mediterranean country), it's beautiful but HOT and working hours like that . . . well, you're not being unreasonable at all not to want to host guests for an extended period of time when you're already being run off your feet in the high season.\n\nBUT . . . \n\nYour wife is also not an AH, nor is she wrong. You note in the comments that her brother and family don't have a high income, and flights are very expensive, and that your wife has noted essentially that it's a waste for them to spend that kind of money to only stay for a week. \n\nAs someone who lives halfway across the world from my own sister and is in a similar situation . . . I can't speak for your wife or her brother, but my family and I only get to see my sister every few years, so as much as we really hate to impose (and honestly I don't even particularly LIKE being away from home for long because I'm ill and the change in routine tends to exacerbate things), once we're making that trip and spending the money, we tend to go for AT LEAST 2 weeks. It's about getting as much time together as we can, renewing family bonds and making new memories, and it's hard to do that in just a week.\n\nIt really is complicated, because I'm sure her brother doesn't want to impose on you either. But if he can only afford to travel very rarely, and he doesn't see his sister often, then it is as much for your wife's sake as for him and his wife and kids  . . . they want to pack in some time together before they have to be apart again for an extended period, you know? Your wife's 10-day compromise may be worth considering. His 18-month-old isn't just \"his kid\" . . . it's your wife's niece or nephew, that perhaps she would like more than just a week to get to know as well. \n\nThere are NAH, but this may be worth making an exception for.", "NAH\nDo you have any friends or family in the area that would offer you a room for some of that time? Basically, you just need somewhere peaceful to sleep and get ready for work on your workdays. Days off or some dinners you can spend at home with wife and family.\n\nTell her nicely that's what will work & will allow her and family to really spend time without worrying about waking up or disturbing a tired, cranky hubby.", "Leaning towards YTA only because of my own family dynamic. If my sister, brother in law, and nephew  wanted to spend 10 days with me, my partner would have asked them to say 14 days. But that\u2019s only because he loves me family more than anything and treats them as if they were his own family. Friends are one thing but my family is another. My family is super conscious about inconveniencing others and aren\u2019t the people to use others. I would understand that it\u2019s a long trip and that they would want to make the most of it so for me, asking for an exception for family isn\u2019t that asshole-ish? Sacrificing a few days of being tired for your wife to spend with her family would be something my partner would have no issues doing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But wife says that the flights are already very expensive for them and that one week isn't enough...", "Thanks. Yes I'm also the kind of person that, when hosting, I like to do barbecue and cook Mediterranean food and take them to the best beaches in the little time I have, and just generally show off the paradise we are lucky to live in. I get that from my mother, but yes, it can be exhausting after a time.", "Or tell them they\u2019re on their own, the wife will be the host and the husband\u2019s routine isn\u2019t to be disturbed. It\u2019s their decision to show up when it would be impossible to visit with him.

And yes she is our niece too and she is adorable and I would like to bond with her more and sit by the BBQ and drink beers with my BIL after work.

If you can get isolation away from other people in your house (not knowing the size of it) then potentially hosting duties could solely fall on your wife, and you interact when you want to rather than feel the need to do so, so you might be able to get some downtime.", "Your not the AH.

A little over 10 years ago I bought a home in a big tourist area. Suddenly everyone I knew (including barely knew) felt they had exclusive rights to use my home as their vacation pad. I can\u2019t tell you how many times people called to say they were coming for a visit (telling me, not asking) and had a list a mile long of all the tourist stuff and site-seeing I was expected to do for them. For the first year or two I bent over backwards to accommodate these people, to my own detriment. Eventually, my spouse and I got sick of it and put in much more restrictive rules (such as whether or not we were even available to host, what times of year people could visit, how long they could stay, etc.). This cut down on the freeloaders immensely and my spouse and I got our lives back. Overall, the point is nobody (including brother in law) is OWED a vacation. It is not your responsibility to provide them a vacation. Stick to your very reasonable guidelines (f they want to visit, they need to either make it a short visit or come outside of tourist season.

Damn. Any man wanna do that for me? Lol", "I hear you and wouldn't downvote for this, but if I were in that situation, I would not have agreed to the week limit without an exception for family.  The time for renegotiating it is between busy seasons, not in the middle of one.", "I think the week is already 3 days too long, since they're hosting other guests right before family. So 4 days, than a week with in laws is already 11 days. Just because it's different people doesn't mean the back to back visits aren't stressing OP out. He's being generous offering them their full week at that exact time already. \n\nI think wife is the one who needs to now offer her side of the compromise.", "This is the part I NEVER understand. People pay outrageous prices for flights when they can\u2019t afford accommodations. Also if you can\u2019t afford a hotel how are you affording so much time off work? Your wife isn\u2019t considering your needs and your work makes it to where she doesn\u2019t have to work.", "This!  Unilateral overruling in a relationship is a first class one way ticket to resentment.  See if you can work with her a few more times if she won't crack then unilaterally veto her and call brother in law directly.", "American bosses frown when employees want to take more than 1 week at a time. \n\nYears back I had a coworker who planned a 2 week honeymoon, had to fight to take 2 consecutive weeks off. It was an office position non customer facing in a global company. \n\nIn retail companies/stores policy is in order to get holiday pay you have to work the day before and the day after a holiday. \n\nI don't know how it works in other countries,  but in America when you go on vacation no one is doing  your workload, it's waiting for your when you get back.  While in non office positions such as retail stores / restaurants/  etc others pick up the slack by working overtime or doing double work.", "My (European) workplace you need approval from the boss to NOT take three weeks summer vacation\u2026", "Shhhh.  Yup are completely wrong.  It should absolutely be avoided in the off-season.  That\u2019s why it\u2019s the off-season \ud83d\ude09", "\u201cDon\u2019t get to go away\u201d it\u2019s not just about the time off - it\u2019s about the money too.", "He's talking about what he will or will not allow his wife to do. She's not his property.  She's an adult. \n\n\nHe could tell her what he can accept in their relationship. He could tell her if he's not getting sufficient rest, he will quit his job and they will lose the house.  He could say he doesn't want to stay married because she isn't respecting his need for rest. I am ALL FOR his boundary that she AGREED to that they don't have guests for more than 7 days in a row. His wife should want to keep him healthy and well rested for work. \n\nI'm against people who use the same language abusers use and then say it's no big deal. \n\nDo you actually ask your current partner if you are ALLOWED to do things ?  Or do you check in about if it's affordable, scheduling issues, etc ?", "NTA but since the arrangements are made set some ground rules. \n\n1. Do not expect you to entertain anyone \n \n2. Quiet time when you nap as it\u2019s necessary for you to function. \n\n3. Next time it has to be off an season visit only \n\n4. Don\u2019t bitch at you for needing to keep to your schedule. \n\nYour wife is lucky and should have stuck to the 1 week and off season rule.", "WNBTA. I've just started a new driving job that's 4am-5pm Monday-Friday, and work casually at a supermarket for no more than 10hrs on weekends. I feel you when you say you just need your down time to avoid burnout. You have communicated this to your wife and she does not respect your physical and mental health. For her to go behind your back and make these plans with her brother is incredibly disrespectful and ignorant to all the hard work you're doing to give her the life she has. Personally I think even a 1 week stay is too much given your schedule. Absolutely don't budge on this, your sanity during a stressful period is way more important.", "YWNBTA\n\nYour wife would be though for prioritizing her family over her spouse.", "Sorry, but it feels like your wife lives on top of your head and doing what she wants. \n\nNow she brings her whole family to get some of the freebies that you work damn hard to provide.\n\nIf it was me, I'd ask her to find a job, so she at least knows what the struggle is. I'd bet she would be the first one to cancel her brother vocation. \n\nYour home is not a hotel. Be firm and stand behind your agreement.", "YWNBTA at all.  she needs to compromise.   She is breaking the rules set by both of you.  Not just one extra week but essentially two.  Because she is having friends for a week, then wanting family for two weeks.\n\nSo thats three weeks of guests when you are trying wrap up a very busy season of work.\n\nI *need* a summer beach vacation too.  If they need it so bad then they can stay on the beach.  lol", "NTA no one on this planet needs a summer beach vacation.  Once week isn't enough? Okay, fine. If you insist, then no weeks. Your wife is incredibly entitled, too. She can get a job so that she can pay for her brother's hotel room.", "NTA. But if eventually you let your in laws visit, let your wife do the hosting and showing them around. She might just be missing her family.", "NTA\n\nYou have a boundry set and she wants to cross it. All because her brother wants a vacation. That is great, he should get one, but not at your expense. They can find a place to stay for a week, while staying with you for only a week. \n\nKeeping the peace at the cost of your own inner peace is not an acceptable deal.", "NTA, they should come later and for one week, in September you already have guests. The rule is there for a reason.", "BIL wants an holiday, but doesn\u2019t want to pay for it!", "3 days doesn't cost you your life\nShe's your wife \nBeing a man is difficult \ud83d\ude24", "I don't understand why they would come peak season if they don't make much.", "You\u2019re a good one. After 3 days that\u2019s too long for me\ud83d\ude05", "I get 4 weeks as an American but it\u2019s unusual to take all at once. I\u2019d rather have multiple vacations throughout the year", "Me and my husband always ask each other if its ok to invite someone over to the house it's common courtesy.", "I'd suggest your wife gets a job for that period and you can take time off. That'll probably help get her thinking straight.", "UWNBTA\n\nIt's a rule now one week because it's during the season and that's too much hosting when you work so hard and need to make the most of your downtime. It's inconsiderate to put hospitality on your schedule for 3 weeks in a row during the busy season. That's why the rule is one week. \n\nAlso who needs a beach vacation and won't be blissfully happy with a whole week? Who travels with a toddler and wants to stay in a remote location for longer? I'd stand firm on the week and encourage another visit during the winter, when beaches are also beautiful and inspiring.", "You and your needs should be more important to your wife than her brother and his family's desire for an extended beach vacation.  She's the A here, as is her brother if he's pressuring her.\n\nNTA", "Man, I get you. I used to do seasonal bussiness in Croatia  and people underrate the workload during summer.\nHaving a small child running around, crying etc is definetly too much.\nOr just not being able to walk half nude in your own house.\nSo, two weeks is too much, one week is ok I guess, they are a familiy...\nHow's the season?
