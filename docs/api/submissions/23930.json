It\u2019s unfair of your wife to back out of your very reasonable agreement - she wants to prioritize her brother & his family over your needs and your previous agreement. \n\nCould you suggest that her brother still come, but not stay at your house? Or only stay at your house for a few days? Of course this would be more expensive for him, but would allow him to vacation and for her to spend time with him and his family while still respecting your agreement and needs.", "NTA she shouldn\u2019t have just announced what would be happening. You both had an agreement. I know what it\u2019s like to be drained from working ridiculous hours. Perhaps since she doesn\u2019t work, she doesn\u2019t understand that. I think a week is plenty.\n\n> She thinks I'm being an AH because her brother needs a summer beach vacation\n\nThat\u2019s not a need, it\u2019s a want.\n\nHopefully she\u2019ll come around. Two weeks with a baby is a lot, even if it wasn\u2019t in the middle of your busy time.", "NTA.  You made a very reasonable agreement that your wife should be abiding by.  It'd be a little different if there was a true emergency and they needed help but a vacation is not enough justification to put your physical and mental health at risk.  Depending on what your business is, could be a liability to not be fully alert and functional from lack of sleep/burning out", "WNBTA, the week rule was already established prior to this situation. She needs to respect that and your busy work schedule. Hosting is exhausting!", "NTA, he does not NEED a summer beach vacation", "NTA. Your work is your livelihood, and it is seasonal. You have to concentrate to get it done, and I would imagine you could lose out on future work if you are too tired and distracted to do it well. Put your foot down. Your wife can apologize to her brother for jumping ahead to invite he and his family before checking with you. I mean, most adults can understand that when you don't go to a person's place of business and endanger their work life, right? Home is your place of business. They can visit in winter if they want to spend more than one week.", "YWNBTA. Tell your wife 2 weeks is fine as long as they start their stay **after** the crazy tourist season.", "NTA I have lived in a tourist destination and I agree that two weeks is too long, this boundary has been in place, and that\u2019s a lot of guests in a row. Her brother may think you\u2019re an asshole though, depending on whether they\u2019ve already booked flights, etc. But really, that\u2019s on your wife for making you the asshole and not expressing the boundary to her brother. The other thing is, 10 days is neither 1 week or 2 weeks, but it IS closer to one week. If you allow it this time, that\u2019s up to you, but I\u2019d make it known there will be no exceptions going forward where she can set you up to be the asshole.", "NTA In my community we have a saying that goes like this...\"Houseguests are like fish, they stink after 3 days\". I wouldn't want them for more than a week either.", "Wnbta my friend, \n\nAt the end of the day you know your limits and have discussed them and made agreements based on them that have done well for years now. You\u2019re still fine with 7 days, is 7 days not enough for a vacation? Could they not stay elsewhere after those 7 days are up? I mean that\u2019s still a whole week of no hotel fees", "NTA. This seems reasonable considering all the work you'll be doing that season. Your wife is the AH though, for telling her brother and his family that they can stay without consulting you.", "NAH, enforce your rule definitely, but try to be creative in thinking up potential compromises. Can they visit 1 week with you, a few days somewhere else, then back to you for the weekend before flying home? Can they come for the last week in October and first week in November - it'll still be warm, right?", "NTA - it\u2019s so stressful having people stay with you, especially if it\u2019s during your busy season.", "NAH\n\nI don't think either of you are AHs. I think this is a legitimate and unfortunate quandary that is probably worth compromising over.\n\nYou aren't an AH for your boundary. It's a very reasonable one. You have an intense and exhausting work schedule during this part of the year, and having been to that part of the world in summertime (my sister also lives in a Mediterranean country), it's beautiful but HOT and working hours like that . . . well, you're not being unreasonable at all not to want to host guests for an extended period of time when you're already being run off your feet in the high season.\n\nBUT . . . \n\nYour wife is also not an AH, nor is she wrong. You note in the comments that her brother and family don't have a high income, and flights are very expensive, and that your wife has noted essentially that it's a waste for them to spend that kind of money to only stay for a week. \n\nAs someone who lives halfway across the world from my own sister and is in a similar situation . . . I can't speak for your wife or her brother, but my family and I only get to see my sister every few years, so as much as we really hate to impose (and honestly I don't even particularly LIKE being away from home for long because I'm ill and the change in routine tends to exacerbate things), once we're making that trip and spending the money, we tend to go for AT LEAST 2 weeks. It's about getting as much time together as we can, renewing family bonds and making new memories, and it's hard to do that in just a week.\n\nIt really is complicated, because I'm sure her brother doesn't want to impose on you either. But if he can only afford to travel very rarely, and he doesn't see his sister often, then it is as much for your wife's sake as for him and his wife and kids  . . . they want to pack in some time together before they have to be apart again for an extended period, you know? Your wife's 10-day compromise may be worth considering. His 18-month-old isn't just \"his kid\" . . . it's your wife's niece or nephew, that perhaps she would like more than just a week to get to know as well. \n\nThere are NAH, but this may be worth making an exception for.", "Idk what to vote. Do you have any friends or family in the area that would offer you a room for some of that time? Basically, you just need somewhere peaceful to sleep and get ready for work on your workdays. Days off or some dinners you can spend at home with wife and family.\n\nTell her nicely that's what will work & will allow her and family to really spend time without worrying about waking up or disturbing a tired, cranky hubby.", "Leaning towards YTA only because of my own family dynamic. If my sister, brother in law, and nephew  wanted to spend 10 days with me, my partner would have asked them to say 14 days. But that\u2019s only because he loves me family more than anything and treats them as if they were his own family. Friends are one thing but my family is another. My family is super conscious about inconveniencing others and aren\u2019t the people to use others. I would understand that it\u2019s a long trip and that they would want to make the most of it so for me, asking for an exception for family isn\u2019t that asshole-ish? Sacrificing a few days of being tired for your wife to spend with her family would be something my partner would have no issues doing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I already said a week with us is fine, and I would love to give them a great vacation with us. But wife says that the flights are already very expensive for them and that one week isn't enough...", "Thanks. Yes I'm also the kind of person that, when hosting, I like to do barbecue and cook Mediterranean food and take them to the best beaches in the little time I have, and just generally show off the paradise we are lucky to live in. I get that from my mother, but yes, it can be exhausting after a time.", "Or tell them they\u2019re on their own, the wife will be the host and the husband\u2019s routine isn\u2019t to be disturbed. It\u2019s their decision to show up when it would be impossible to visit with him. If all they expect to do is see the wife and hit the beach I think it could work out fine without disrupting the OP.", "Thanks. Yeah I agree with all your points. And yes she is our niece too and she is adorable and I would like to bond with her more and sit by the BBQ and drink beers with my BIL after work.

If you can get isolation away from other people in your house (not knowing the size of it) then potentially hosting duties could solely fall on your wife, and you interact when you want to rather than feel the need to do so, so you might be able to get some downtime.", "Your not the AH. They are, they should know that you have a hard work schedule. Your wife sounds like a brat. Maybe she like to work 12 hour days and you stay home. She might change he mind.

You and your wife already agreed to the one week limit and it\u2019s unfair of her to basically have back-to-back visitors during your busy season.

A little over 10 years ago I bought a home in a big tourist area. Suddenly everyone I knew (including barely knew) felt they had exclusive rights to use my home as their vacation pad. I can\u2019t tell you how many times people called to say they were coming for a visit (telling me, not asking) and had a list a mile long of all the tourist stuff and site-seeing I was expected to do for them. For the first year or two I bent over backwards to accommodate these people, to my own detriment. Eventually, my spouse and I got sick of it and put in much more restrictive rules (such as whether or not we were even available to host, what times of year people could visit, how long they could stay, etc.). This cut down on the freeloaders immensely and my spouse and I got our lives back. Overall, the point is nobody (including brother in law) is OWED a vacation. It is not your responsibility to provide them a vacation. Stick to your very reasonable guidelines (f they want to visit, they need to either make it a short visit or come outside of tourist season.

So, work likely starts around 6 am, and he's done for the day at 8 pm. (06:00 to 20:00 as the locals would say.) Add in travel time and time to do personal care (bathing, share of chores, etc), OP could either host late night gatherings or sleep.
