A week I enjoy, but any more and I start just getting frustrated and need my personal space back. \n\n\nMy wife has some friends coming to stay first week of September for 4 nights and I'm really looking forward to it.

It\u2019s unfair of your wife to back out of your very reasonable agreement - she wants to prioritize her brother & his family over your needs and your previous agreement. \n\nCould you suggest that her brother still come, but not stay at your house? Or only stay at your house for a few days? Of course this would be more expensive for him, but would allow him to vacation and for her to spend time with him and his family while still respecting your agreement and needs.", "NTA she shouldn\u2019t have just announced what would be happening. You both had an agreement. I know what it\u2019s like to be drained from working ridiculous hours. Perhaps since she doesn\u2019t work, she doesn\u2019t understand that. I think a week is plenty.\n\n> She thinks I'm being an AH because her brother needs a summer beach vacation\n\nThat\u2019s not a need, it\u2019s a want.\n\nHopefully she\u2019ll come around. Two weeks with a baby is a lot, even if it wasn\u2019t in the middle of your busy time.", "NTA.  You made a very reasonable agreement that your wife should be abiding by.  It'd be a little different if there was a true emergency and they needed help but a vacation is not enough justification to put your physical and mental health at risk.  Depending on what your business is, could be a liability to not be fully alert and functional from lack of sleep/burning out", "WNBTA, the week rule was already established prior to this situation. She needs to respect that and your busy work schedule. Hosting is exhausting!", "NTA, he does not NEED a summer beach vacation", "NTA. Your work is your livelihood, and it is seasonal. You have to concentrate to get it done, and I would imagine you could lose out on future work if you are too tired and distracted to do it well. Put your foot down. Your wife can apologize to her brother for jumping ahead to invite he and his family before checking with you. I mean, most adults can understand that when you don't go to a person's place of business and endanger their work life, right? Home is your place of business. They can visit in winter if they want to spend more than one week.", "YWNBTA. Tell your wife 2 weeks is fine as long as they start their stay **after** the crazy tourist season.", "NTA I have lived in a tourist destination and I agree that two weeks is too long, this boundary has been in place, and that\u2019s a lot of guests in a row. Her brother may think you\u2019re an asshole though, depending on whether they\u2019ve already booked flights, etc. But really, that\u2019s on your wife for making you the asshole and not expressing the boundary to her brother. The other thing is, 10 days is neither 1 week or 2 weeks, but it IS closer to one week. If you allow it this time, that\u2019s up to you, but I\u2019d make it known there will be no exceptions going forward where she can set you up to be the asshole.", "NTA In my community we have a saying that goes like this...\"Houseguests are like fish, they stink after 3 days\". I wouldn't want them for more than a week either.", "Wnbta my friend, \n\nAt the end of the day you know your limits and have discussed them and made agreements based on them that have done well for years now. You\u2019re still fine with 7 days, is 7 days not enough for a vacation? Could they not stay elsewhere after those 7 days are up? I mean that\u2019s still a whole week of no hotel fees", "NTA. This seems reasonable considering all the work you'll be doing that season. Your wife is the AH though, for telling her brother and his family that they can stay without consulting you.", "NAH, enforce your rule definitely, but try to be creative in thinking up potential compromises. Can they visit 1 week with you, a few days somewhere else, then back to you for the weekend before flying home? Can they come for the last week in October and first week in November - it'll still be warm, right?", "NTA - it\u2019s so stressful having people stay with you, especially if it\u2019s during your busy season.", "NAH\n\nI don't think either of you are AHs. I think this is a legitimate and unfortunate quandary that is probably worth compromising over.\n\nYou aren't an AH for your boundary. It's a very reasonable one. You have an intense and exhausting work schedule during this part of the year, and having been to that part of the world in summertime (my sister also lives in a Mediterranean country), it's beautiful but HOT and working hours like that . . . well, you're not being unreasonable at all not to want to host guests for an extended period of time when you're already being run off your feet in the high season.\n\nBUT . . . \n\nYour wife is also not an AH, nor is she wrong. You note in the comments that her brother and family don't have a high income, and flights are very expensive, and that your wife has noted essentially that it's a waste for them to spend that kind of money to only stay for a week. \n\nAs someone who lives halfway across the world from my own sister and is in a similar situation . . . I can't speak for your wife or her brother, but my family and I only get to see my sister every few years, so as much as we really hate to impose (and honestly I don't even particularly LIKE being away from home for long because I'm ill and the change in routine tends to exacerbate things), once we're making that trip and spending the money, we tend to go for AT LEAST 2 weeks. It's about getting as much time together as we can, renewing family bonds and making new memories, and it's hard to do that in just a week.\n\nIt really is complicated, because I'm sure her brother doesn't want to impose on you either. But if he can only afford to travel very rarely, and he doesn't see his sister often, then it is as much for your wife's sake as for him and his wife and kids  . . . they want to pack in some time together before they have to be apart again for an extended period, you know? Your wife's 10-day compromise may be worth considering. His 18-month-old isn't just \"his kid\" . . . it's your wife's niece or nephew, that perhaps she would like more than just a week to get to know as well. \n\nThere are NAH, but this may be worth making an exception for.", "Idk what to vote. Do you have any friends or family in the area that would offer you a room for some of that time? Basically, you just need somewhere peaceful to sleep and get ready for work on your workdays. Days off or some dinners you can spend at home with wife and family.\n\nTell her nicely that's what will work & will allow her and family to really spend time without worrying about waking up or disturbing a tired, cranky hubby.", "Leaning towards YTA only because of my own family dynamic. If my sister, brother in law, and nephew  wanted to spend 10 days with me, my partner would have asked them to say 14 days. But that\u2019s only because he loves me family more than anything and treats them as if they were his own family. Friends are one thing but my family is another. My family is super conscious about inconveniencing others and aren\u2019t the people to use others. I would understand that it\u2019s a long trip and that they would want to make the most of it so for me, asking for an exception for family isn\u2019t that asshole-ish? Sacrificing a few days of being tired for your wife to spend with her family would be something my partner would have no issues doing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You aren\u2019t saying they cannot come at all just that they cannot stay longer than a week. It\u2019s not a new thing and it\u2019s not just aimed at her brother but everyone. Stand your ground on this and say your love to have them again in November when the busy season is over and you can spend time visiting instead of working.", "YWNBTA, and you might reconsider allowing any guests during the high season.  It sounds as if you have plenty of times during the year in which you could host people.  You\u2019re too busy right now.", "ESH your wife for not sticking to rhe rule and you for lying. 10 days and 2 weeks are vastly.diffrrent when it comea.to houseguests. You are acting like it is double the agreed on time not three extra days.", "Accommodation is ridiculously expensive at this time of year here and my wife's family comes from a European country with very low salaries. I already said a week with us is fine, and I would love to give them a great vacation with us. But wife says that the flights are already very expensive for them and that one week isn't enough...", "Thanks. Yes I'm also the kind of person that, when hosting, I like to do barbecue and cook Mediterranean food and take them to the best beaches in the little time I have, and just generally show off the paradise we are lucky to live in. I get that from my mother, but yes, it can be exhausting after a time.", "Or tell them they\u2019re on their own, the wife will be the host and the husband\u2019s routine isn\u2019t to be disturbed. It\u2019s their decision to show up when it would be impossible to visit with him. If all they expect to do is see the wife and hit the beach I think it could work out fine without disrupting the OP.", "Thanks. Yeah I agree with all your points. And yes she is our niece too and she is adorable and I would like to bond with her more and sit by the BBQ and drink beers with my BIL after work. But we do always go visit them a couple of times a year and stay for a few days (but not at their house) so it isn't like we are estranged. For example, wife just spent 10 days with her sister in Prague, while I'm at home grafting. \n\nWife and I are both expats here and away from our families, but this is the life we chose. But yes, I am thinking now to just allow the 10 day compromise, but also to explain that in the future my wife needs to explain to people our 1 week agreement, because making me feel like an asshole about it isn't OK, imo.", "Unfortunately there is a housing affordability crisis here due to so many houses being tourist rentals. And think that the house on the property up from me is 15000 euros for a week right now. So other accommodation is basically out of the question.\n\nAlso, I generally don't get tired and cranky with guests, I tend to bottle it all up and put the happy gracious host mask on and at the end I'm destroyed.", "The thing is, we live on an island famous for its beaches and pristine water, so of course, everybody wants to visit then hahaha. But it's OK, I love being social and having visitors, just not for extended periods.", "Then it seems like there are a couple options:\n1. The brother\u2019s family can come at a different time of year (off season)\n2. The brother\u2019s family can come and stay with you for one week\n3. The brother\u2019s family can come and stay for a week with you and stay for longer in other accommodations \n\nThere needs to be some kind of compromise on your wife\u2019s part - it\u2019s unfair for her to unilaterally change your established agreement.", "As a thought, would it be possible to have them come, but state to your wife that you will not be playing host (or if you are only for a week as per the previously agreed terms).  If you can get isolation away from other people in your house (not knowing the size of it) then potentially hosting duties could solely fall on your wife, and you interact when you want to rather than feel the need to do so, so you might be able to get some downtime.", "Your not the AH. They are, they should know that you have a hard work schedule. Your wife sounds like a brat. Maybe she like to work 12 hour days and you stay home. She might change he mind. Her brother can wait a few weeks to come so you all can enjoy your time together.  I would be so pissed if I had guests and watch them have fun as I went to work day after day for 12 hours as they enjoyed my home without me.", "If you are going down this route, could a compromise be that for some of these days they're out of the house when you come home for siesta? You get an empty house and some down time and they get to go explore somewhere?\n\nI get the drain of being \"on\" all the time", "\"I am thinking now to just allow...\"\n\nI was going to say that you set a time limit for holiday vacations during your work season and your wife agreed so NTA for not agreeing to changes this year. \n\nBest to watch the terminology on if you \"allow\" her to have guests. She can invite company to her home any time and for as long as she wishes.   If you don't like that, get a divorce.", "Allowing a compromise to 10 days is what I said. And I said I'd love to have them for a week. If you think that's ground's for a divorce, I'm leaning to think you probably aren't married. Marriage is about compromise.\n\nShe could just tell them to come for a month without asking me at all. But that is not how it works.", "There is no room for compromise when a partner is talking about what they will \"allow\" for their partner to do.\n\nYou can agree to a compromise...or not. \"Allowing\" it says that you think the decision is all yours. It's not.", "I think you are too focused on the word allow. You can interchange agree with allow and read it again. Same same"]}
