As an adult I tolerated her in hopes of having some kind of relationship with my father.

We clearly where not welcome. \n\nShe bag an stalking me and attacking me on social media until I simply ended our relationship. Now, my father and her started playing games with my kids immediately after this. They ignored 3/4 children\u2019s existence. Calling only my second oldest and sending gifts to him. Which is ironic as my father stated his was is an amazing grandmother.  That\u2019s not how \u201camazing grandmothers\u201d behaves. \n\nThe final straw came when she posted that her son was going to be a father. Her biological child. She announced that she was going to be a \u201cfirst time\u201d grandmother. Which immediately infuriated me. She had been using my children as a place holder. \n\nWhen I reached out to my father on this issue she said to stop making things about me, get therapy and that it\u2019s her \u201cbiological\u201d grandchild. Which in my opinion shouldn\u2019t matter. In the eyes of my children she has been a grandparent their entire lives. \n\nI posted about this issue to social media and the video went viral. I then began openly discussing the trauma I went through as a child. Now she\u2019s trying to sue me for cyber bullying and want all my videos taken down.

Good luck with that, I roll my eyes, lol. \n\nWhy don\u2019t you block her and walk away. Your dad, too, since he doesn\u2019t seem to have a problem with his wife having been toxic to you all these years. \nNTA", "NTA if you told the truth. \n\nThen this is your trauma and your truth. She can\u2019t sue you for defamation if it\u2019s the truth. \n\nDo not let her near your children unless you want them to suffer the same trauma", "NTA.  You have a right to discuss your own experiences truthfully and express your own feelings whatever they may be.  I also agree that adopted children do not and should not count as less than biological children.  Every child deserves to feel loved and special.  Personally, however, I would never have posted that kind of a video on social media publicly.  I don\u2019t see what good could come of it, and while you didn\u2019t name her, it could be traced back to her.  If she had been a better person though, no such video would have been created.\n\nEveryone here could try being more kind and sensitive.", "Now for my own comments NTA you exposed your SMs actions to the whole laughing world she's just mad because the people who know about the videos who know you know exactly who you're talking about and she's embarrassed because now she's going to suffer the consequences of her actions Good on you and made her consequences be swift and just", "NTA\n\nBut why do you still talk to either of them? Take out the trash and live well without them in your life.", "NTA. Don't let her or your father near your family. They can be dead to you now.", "NTA.", "She is doing the same thing so tell her go ahead and you\u2019re filing a counterclaim against her! NTA", "ESH\u2026 you can post on SM but why are you still dealing with these people? Yes you need therapy so they can help you cut these people out of your life.", "I don\u2019t think YTA, however, as you stated, you faced childhood trauma, maybe seeing a therapist will do you some good. Not because your dad suggested it but for you, your husband and kids, in the long run.", "ESH. She sounds awful, but social media is not the place to dump all your problems out, especially when you have kids. Handle that shit with a therapist, don\u2019t drag the whole world into your drama.", "NTA. She shouldn't dish it out if she can't take it.", "If true, ESH. Her for the way she treated you growing up, your father for not protecting you and not putting you first, you because you subjected your children to your abuser. What the hell does that teach them?", "Personally I would take it down and send them this.\n\nSince it seems my children are nit your grandkids and that you want to pit them against each other for your attention or hurt them by this behavior then at this n point neither of you will be considered family and will no longer have contact with any of us. Enjoy your real family.\n\nThen do not discuss or anything and follow through. I know you want a relationship with your dad but your kids are going to be the ones who suffer if it continues and they see the favoritism that will happen.", "ESH. For sure your MIL has caused you some trauma... but you went on blast on social? Why? This is not how you solve your problems.", "ESH - she\u2019s a A if she has made your childhood a misery but you\u2019re the A for making public posts!  I\u2019ve no idea why your relationship is so bad but it sounds like whatever she does will offend you - you don\u2019t like her and I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t think of her as a grandmother to your children (do they even call her that) so why be incredibly offended by her excitement about a new grandchild\n\nYou have a mutually toxic relationship - I\u2019d suggest getting some therapy - maybe even family therapy!", "YTA for posting drama on social media, regardless of your stepmom's actions. Take your cringe attention-seeking behavior elsewhere. The only thing you accomplished was humiliating yourself and your parents in front of every random acquaintance on your friends list.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
