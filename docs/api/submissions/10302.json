I have never met the baby's father but he's in his late 20's and already has two older sons.\n\nMy daughter told me she was pregnant during Thanksgiving weekend when she came home from her freshman year of college. She later admitted about who the father was and how she had met him.\n\nIn her senior year of high school, she started a new part-time job that she loved and became close to the older girls that worked there. She ended up deferring her college enrolment for a year, spending half the time working and the other half traveling. The older girls got her a fake I.D. and they started taking her to bars. They specifically frequently went to a bar in a neighbouring town. This is where my daughter met her baby's father as he worked there and was a regular even when not working. They became friendly and after knowing him for a few weeks he asked her to come home with him. They then started meeting up frequently until she left for college, when she cut him off completely (including deleting his number). Although my daughter was only 18 when she met him, she told him she was 21, and now he thinks she's 23. He still has no idea her real age.\n\nMy daughter has so far not told him that she is pregnant. She can't call him as she deleted his number, and she can't contact him online as he has no social media. The only way to contact him would be to go see him in person either at his home or at the bar. She is scared to tell him as she doesn't think he will be happy about the baby. She is also nervous about the fact she will have to come clean about her real age and some other stuff she apparently lied to him about.\n\nBoth myself and my husband have been trying to pressure her into telling the baby's father as the baby is due in a few weeks and could come at any time. I think she should have told him months ago and it's unfair that she has only left him a few weeks to mentally prepare. She keeps flip-flopping between saying she'll tell him soon to maybe she won't be telling him at all.\n\nAt this point I am ready to go to the bar to either find him or someone that can give me his number, so I can tell him myself. The last few months have been stressful for everyone in our family, and I know my daughter is going through a lot but burying her head in the sand about the baby's father is not helping her and it won't help her child. I have told her if she doesn't get in contact with him by the end of the week, I will be. I know she will be incredibly mad at me if I do, but I feel like she's leaving me know choice. Would I be the asshole if I go through with it? Am I interfering too much? Should I just leave it up to her?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: To add my husband and I are currently financially supporting and hope to continue supporting her with college. We would like for her to be able to get child support so it is less of a financial burden on us, as well as, for her to have more help with the baby when she does decide to return to college.", "created_utc": 1676743920, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115leq7/wibta_if_i_tell_my_daughters_former_hook_up_shes/", "score": 962, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are you sure enough that he isn't potentially violent to bet her safety on it?", "I believe morally the father has the right know, however this is not someone you know. So he could be very dangerous and your daughter could no this. If this is the case you could be putting your daughter and grandchild in danger.\n\nEven if this is not the case your daughter confided in you. If you go behind her back and tell the father you will show her she can\u2019t trust you. Your will damage your relationship with her and possibly loose contact with her and your grandchild.\n\nI would continue to counsel her on telling the father. I would even have her speak to a family lawyer and a therapist. Maybe they can make her understand how important this situation is and the ramifications on not telling the dad. At the end of the day this should be your only involvement I telling dad.\n\nSo this is part of the advise I am probably going to get a lot of hate for. Tell your daughter that you love her and your grandchild but you can not take on all the financial burden this is causing your family. You will offer to help her with a community college where she can work and you can help with the baby or she can go after child support (unless dad is unsafe to be around) but she has to help in some way to financially support her daughter.", "Unless you are sure you know the full story about why she cut this guy off so completely, stay out of it.

Also I don\u2019t buy she can\u2019t get a hold of him - she can totally look at her previous phone bills.

Have her do it in a safe manner in case there is some sort of abuse in the mix. \nOh\u2026 and imho, the deleted phone number bullshit is a load of horseshit.

However, your daughter has stated she doesn\u2019t want to tell him because then she would have to come clean about lies she told him.  \n\nYour daughter is not understanding how much support she will need to raise a child.  It sounds like daughter is planning on relying on you and your husband.  If that\u2019s the case, your daughter has a lot of maturing to do before the baby is born.  \n\nYour daughter decided to keep this child, therefore this child has a right to benefit from having both parents in his life.  By informing the father, this child could benefit by having more people in his life to provide for him.  \n\nYour daughter\u2019s not a child anymore, she\u2019s a parent.

Hate to say that about a mother protecting her baby (and I\u2019d probably be tempted to do the same), but your daughter has to do this on her own. \n\nIt\u2019s time to sit down with your daughter and work out the practicalities - and budget it all out - from birthing and medical care to diapers and day care. What she\u2019s going to do about school, all that. This has serious financial and practical repercussions and let that sink in softly. \n\nIf possible, maybe a couple sessions with a therapist to plot out some options. LCSWs are great with this because they generally have a decent working knowledge of the social services system, basic family law, bureaucracy, etc. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, your daughter may have gotten a good fake ID, but I bet that bartender had a decent clue she was underage.", "ESH.  Your daughter is being incredibly immature.  Feel your motives are off as well.  The best thing you can help your daughter do is speak with an attorney and demand child support as she will need financial assistance with your grandchild.", "YTA.\n\nI'm not sure how you believe this is your place to break the news to him. \n\nNow your daughter might be sticking her head in the sand. But you're not doing her or your future grandchild any favors. She's going to be a mom and she needs to learn to step up and advocate for her child.

Maybe he forced himself on her. Maybe he was abusive. Maybe he's an alcoholic or drug addict. You could be forcing her to talk to her attacker. She won't tell you because she doesn't want others to think of her as the victim of a sex crime.\n\nAlso, if he knows, he can seek custody sharing or full custody. Normally, this is a good thing -- we want kids to know their fathers -- but if there are risks, your daughter may be afraid to let him see the child.

Everyone telling you that's okay is disgusting.", "I\u2019m going with NAH. As parents/soon to be grandparents you are frustrated with your daughter\u2019s complete lack of urgency regarding the reality of her situation. Babies are life changing and expensive. Right now it looks like you are the ones expected to carry that burden. Your daughter is 20 years old, probably scared to tell the baby daddy because he doesn\u2019t know her actual age or situation and she\u2019s embarrassed. OR maybe someone else could be the father and she\u2019s not ready to point the finger until baby is born and she has a better idea. I\u2019ve known people who did that. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t tell the potential dad myself but I might go check out this bar to see if I could get a feel for the guy. As it\u2019s been stated here already be probably knew she had a fake ID. My son is a bartender (not an abusive alcoholic TYVM) and he can spot a fake ID a mile away. \n\nThis is a complicated situation.

Get over yourself and help her in the way she\u2019s asked you to!", "NTA if she\u2019s expecting your financial and physical support in raising her child. If she\u2019s willing to take full responsibility for herself and her child then it wouldn\u2019t be any of your business. But I agree with everyone suggesting that you should ask her outright if she has been avoiding him out of any kind of fear of violence from him. I didn\u2019t get that impression from your post but it\u2019s best to be clear about it and not make any assumptions.", "NTA because she expects you to financially support her and the baby. If she wants to act like an adult and make her own decisions, she needs to do so financially too. Of course you want the father to know so he can help support financially.", "This is a huge can of worms that goes well beyond an n-t-a or y-t-a.  First of all, how many lives does your daughter intend to ruin with her lies?  This baby has a father.  The father deserves to know.  The baby deserves to know who the father is and receive financial support (at minimum) from that father.  Is it your burden to make that happen?  I don't think so, but clearly your daughter has made it this far in life thinking it's not her responsibility either.   Is she really going to make this child grow up feeling unloved/unwanted by the father simply because she's too chickenshit to admit she lied about her age to him?  Of course he's not going to be happy to learn she lied and he has a baby on the way.  So what?  Do what's right for the baby, starting with getting the truth out there for everyone to see.  Once everyone has a full deck of facts in front of them, THEN you can start figuring out who's the AH and who's not.\n\nEditing to add: ok, wait.  Your daughter is an AH.  That's clear already.  Not just for lying and trying to hide a baby, but for appearing to think she can avoid facing 18 years of co-parenting by dumping the cost, stress, and responsibility onto her parents.  She's got some serious growing up to do.", "YWBTA \n\nI know you are the parent, but this is something that is completely up to her.

He might me abusive, he might have hit her, he might be on drugs to the point where she doesn't feel comfortable with her child being in that environment.\n\nNow, if none of that is the case and your daughter just doesn't want to have an awkward conversation, then your daughter not telling him is absolutely wrong, and she should definitely tell him. In that case, he has a right to know and the kid has a right to have their father in their life. I don't know what the situation is, so I can't comment on that.\n\nBut either way, itultimately isn't your place to tell him.
