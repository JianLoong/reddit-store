The cousin receiving the BBQ sauce, thought it was hilarious. That cousin turned around and bought jumper cables for an uncle who had a heart attack the next Christmas.

She clearly did not know the intended recipient as well as she thought she did. But the girl is 17 and the risk assessment center of her brain is not fully developed, as she's showing by doubling down and refusing to apologize.

It would have taken two seconds to check with someone else whether this was a good idea or not.
