I\u2019m not excusing it. I hope to god she has people in her life (her mom sounds decent) that can help her navigate this and learn from it because she has a LOT to fucking learn. I just think it\u2019s important we stop throwing people into simplistic boxes with exaggerated scarlet letters because **we** need the situation to **feel** more simple than it is or a certain way to suit **our** needs. It\u2019s dichotomized thinking and it\u2019s intellectually lazy and socially harmful.", "\"Trying to bully him\" would require intent. She clearly didn't intend to bully him. However, what she did was extremely insensitive and thoughtless. Whether she intended to or not, the result is probably that the guy felt like she was making fun of him - or at absolute best that she was reminding him of something he'd rather not be forced to think about. \n\nShe may not have been trying to bully him, but I'm guessing that's what it felt like she was doing, to him.", "That is hilarious and poignant.\n\nAnd not at all mean either!   I could easily see it hurting someone's feelings if it wasn't their sense of humor, but in actuality it was just pointing out the very real difference in your life, in a terse but factual way.", "I would think it is funny. But I def understand OP's friend didn't. That aside, if she doesn't know his personality,  she's not really in love..", "The key here, especially for me personally, is the familiarity. Certain people I allow the dark comments and jokes from. Most others, absolutely not.", "Usually it's the person suffering who uses dark humour to help them get through it. They don't get through it via other people making jokes about them, what the fuck", "Ooh they're not happy with you either lol. Some of my comments in here are my most down voted in a while. And I've been commenting on Israel/Gaza posts lol", "I agree. But in this case, intent does matter purely because one involves trying to hurt him vs just being ignorant and hurting him.", "It was pretty great he apologized after the joke saying okay that was a little mean I feel bad, but I told him not to worry about it and just kept laughing.", "Sometimes you have to laugh to keep from crying.", "After my father-in-law had to get his leg amputated, we got him a stuffed parrot and an eyepatch for his birthday. He loved it so much that he loved to jokingly call himself the pirate peg leg from that time on.", "Same, lol. you ever have those nights where you just drunken Reddit and wake up four hours later and think \u201cwhat the fuck did I do/say?\u201d in a mostly boring Reddit existence? Ah, the sobering light of day. \n\nSome of these down votes are a badge of honor though. I\u2019m still working on my Reddit Cares merit badge ;)", "It matters overall - but it doesn't make much difference to the one who's been wronged, especially not in the moment. The end result is she made an insensitive joke on his behalf, whether she was being ignorant or actively trying to hurt him... and then she went and doubled down on why it was so funny and how he needs to get over it (as per OP's comments).", "Ah, yes, the it was only a joke! cry of the bully.", "But not in this case.", "When my husband and I had to discuss the possible amputation of his foot, we joked a lot about him getting a keg leg and having a carved claw-like foot.  Sometimes you need the dark humor, but the sister seriously misread the room on this one.\n\nWe were lucky to avoid the amputation, but now he's going to get a tattoo on his leg--one of those \"warranty void if removed\" kinds of things, like you see on electronics.", "The Old Guy had a knee replacement earlier this year. For his birthday I got him a replica of the Tin Man's oil can.", "I've gotten one of those over a post in the NFL subreddit lol", "Yea but we aren't the ones who were wronged so we can judge based on intent. But you're right that doubling down and telling him to get over it is not a good look and she obviously needs to learn to be more empathetic.", "Lmfao....THIS is why I fell in love with Reddit. Hilarious", "I personally think the joke is funny and if I were the friend I'd have laughed, but it's not for everyone. Your sister should have known a bit better whether this sort of joke would fly with him or not. NTA, your sister should apologize to your buddy", "She just needs to accept that she made a mistake and apologize. She clearly does not know your friend well enough if she thought he would accept that gift in the way she intended it. I LOVE dark humor and I get what she was going for, but I think there\u2019s still a very clear line, especially on his birthday while he\u2019s also going through something very big and traumatic. \nShe just needs to accept that she f***ed up and move on.", "NTA Your sisters biggest mistake was giving a dark humor gift to someone she isn't that close to. You have to know the person intimately and know they will appreciate it. Otherwise it's just mean. Hopefully she learns from this but I doubt he'll ever forget it or be interested in pursuing a relationship with her.\n\nOh your mom needs to stay out of it. Your sister made the mess, she needs to clean it up.", "NTA.  My word.  I have a dark sense of humor and would never do something like that.  Maybe ask her how she would feel if she was going through the worst time of her life, dealing with chemotherapy side effects, losing her hair and then to had some insensitive clod give her a comb for a birthday present when it could be his last birthday.  Does she gave any sort of a clue what chemo does to a person?!  It takes away your health, makes you feel awful inside and out, self conscious, miserable, racks a persons mental health too.  I would have grabbed her and thrown her out myself.", "NTA", "The key is knowing each other well enough to make these jokes. NTA, sis was also pretty lazy with that one if that's the only thing she was gonna give him.", "NTA\n\nI guess she can't grasp how bad hair loss is for most people just generally, let alone a younger guy.  \n\nIf she wants to apologize, she should show some solidarity and shave her head.", "Your sister sounds like an idiot. You\u2019re not the AH, but your sister is.", "NTA, and I think you are right about staying out of the drama", "Alrighty my dude, you my friend NTA. Now your sister on the other hand that\u2019s a different story. Look I get she\u2019s only 17 I was 17 once but I think she has not only hurt his feelings but instead of making the situation better, she basically spat in his face rather then apologizing. At this point I suggest for her to sincerely apologize and not over text, and then possibly reevaluate her choices and steer clear of your BF. Her behavior is pretty sad and worst of all it\u2019s your best friend she is hurting. Have you spoken with him? I really don\u2019t see him wanting to hang out with her at this point much less go on a date. She is going to have to learn actions have consequences.", "NTA: You obviously did the right thing. Sometimes people need to feel the hurt they cause, and you stepped in exactly when you needed to. Some people are on with jokes like that, some aren't. It's called reading the room.", "This is a really important lesson that she needs to learn on her own. She has to learn how to interact with people now when she is young and people will be ok with her immature and cruel sense of humor. Let her figure it out she can dig herself out of this hole. Either way she will learn to be more selective with her jokes.", "NTA. Good god, your sister thought that would be a funny gift!? That\u2019s insane. Some people might find it funny, I guess, but you really need to know your audience.", "Nta", "NTA, the thing with dark humor, or any for that matter, is knowing your audience.   \nI have friends that would laugh their asses off in this situation, and others that would horrified.  \nSounds like she likes her IDEA of him being her BF, but doesn't know the actual person.", "NTA.  This wasn't a joke it was pure cruelty.  Although with your mom only caring about her daughter and not the actual injured party I'm not surprised she thinks cruelty is funny.", "It's like giving a guy whose head got caught off a hat.", "TNH", "Yeah,on second thought a teenager who misfired a joke is just beyond redemption for life. Go NC and spread the word until she\u2019s friendless. \ud83d\ude44", "Ouch ok, not the right move here whatsoever.", "She may as well forget asking for a date\u2026 it\u2019s never gonna happen", "Right. When you're the one staring down the barrel of your own mortality, it's different. When other people are making the jokes while you're considering your mortality, the tone shifts, no matter how dark your own humor can be.", "Starting to think that between her gaslighting the friend and how the mother wants the brother to coddle her, maybe the sister is the type that was never told \"no\" or ever had any consequences \"it's not you honey, it's them\" sort of person", "She's 17. Most 17 year olds are jerks, or at least selfish and inept.", "Yeah, and Mom isn't really helping with that, especially considering all parties are roughly the same age, but one is dealing with cancer. I feel like the lesson / message I'd say if I were OP (in front of Mom perhaps) is \"Yeah, not everyone has the same sense of humor, and you do owe him an apology, but you know what's more attractive across the board than a sense of humor that may or may not land? Accountability and the maturity to own your own actions. Food for thought\"", "I think there's a wide chasm between \"jerks\" and \"at least selfish and inept.\" And I also think most people have enough social graces to avoid saying \"ha ha, you almost died...\"", "My cousin lost his hair to chemo and he would have CRACKED up laughing.  This is one of those 'know your audience' occurrences.", "Some people do. I have an uncle who lost a foot to diabetes. My parents went to visit him in the hospital, asked how he was feeling. My uncles response,  a foot shorter. Then laughed at my father's Hopalong Cassidy joke. There are people with a dark sense of humor, this young man isn't one of them and she clearly didn't read the room.", "People are allowed to not like dark humour. Or to use it as a coping mechanism for themselves, but be upset when people who don't know them well use it to laugh at them.\n\nSaying \"anyone who doesn't have the same sense of humour as me is a killjoy\" makes you an asshole.", "He doesn\u2019t have to do anything . The length you\u2019re trying to pretend her behaviour is completely normal is interesting. While she has limited experience her doubling down and refusing to apologize is a problem specific to her that you can\u2019t just put through the \"im a teenager\" umbrella. She is 17 she is isn\u2019t 14 time to get some accountability about how she acted. She was a bully in the moment and continued to do so by now backing down after her the gift went horribly. I didn\u2019t say she was the devil that will be defined by this moment for all time .", "We know, that's why he's going through treatment so it doesn't go flat\n\n\nI'll see myself out", "Yeah, but that was your mom and she knew you and your sense of humor.", "Typically \u201claugh to keep from crying\u201d is something that you do for yourself about your own situation.", "As the saying goes, \"If the person on the gallows makes a grim joke, that's gallows humor. If someone in the crowd makes a joke, that's part of the execution.\"", "Yeah, but you need to know the time and place and she is absolutely clueless.", "And sometimes you tell people to F off and leave.", "I\u2019m not saying he has to have a sense of humor about it. I\u2019m saying IF he did, an apology could totally resolve it. IF he does not, then I agree an apology is unlikely to do much."]}
