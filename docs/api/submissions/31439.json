You assume this dog is not a service animal for the sole reason that it sniffed what was around it, something every dog does, and especially in a new environment. You stating that the dog owner didn't claim the dog to be a service animal means absolutely nothing because they don't have to defend their medical history to you or even the restaurant.

Or they'll say, \"They are an ESA that helps with my anxiety\", which allows you the legal right to kick their pet out because ESAs (Emotional Support Animals) don't have the public rights that proper service animals do. \n\nI have never had someone with a legitimate service animal refuse to answer either ADA-approved question or otherwise cause a scene about it. They are usually very quick and cooperative with their answers as well. And they don't *have* to give away any specific details about their condition by providing an example of the tasks the dog can perform, which is a major reason why it's ADA-approved. They can just say, \"He has been trained to get help from other people if I need it, he can bring me things, he can help carry objects for me, and he makes sure I take my medications on time\", for instance. A service dog that can perform those kinds of standard tasks can be for pretty much anybody with any condition.

The second question is a really good way to get people to admit it\u2019s just an emotional support animal and not actually trained to provide a service. \n\nAlso people don\u2019t need to be able to prove training has been done or prove that they are a service animal.
