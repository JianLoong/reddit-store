This past year my father passed away, you can save condolences because he was honestly never a GREAT father. \n\nWe definitely grew up a pretty wealthy family. He was a good provider and was always busy working, paired with that was his inability to express emotion, he drank a lot and wasn\u2019t the kindest to my mother or older siblings but he was always very kind to me and definitely showed favoritism. By the time I was old enough to really see him for the person he was my other siblings were already out of the house and had cut off contact with him and seemingly harbored some resentment towards me as well in the form of trying to make me choose sides as a child, then ostracizing me for maintaining a relationship with my father. \n\nMy dad made my last years living at home really amazing, and then when it was time he paid for college and supported me through it. Something he didn\u2019t do for either of my siblings, but from what I understood he offered and they rejected. My brother didn\u2019t even invite him to his wedding. When my dad got sick about 2 years ago neither of my siblings really showed any concern. Then when he actually did pass it was like pulling teeth to get my brother and sister to help with funeral stuff and even showing up.\n\nWhen my dads final will was uncovered it came out that he had left a pretty substantial and life changing amount of money to me and he had onlyleft a property for the both of them to split. He left letters for each of us individually and in mine he explained his decision and that ultimately he was leaving the choice up to me that if I wanted to share it I could but he didn\u2019t feel they deserved it directly from him. \n\nI wasn\u2019t able to access the money until the end of the calendar year and as far as now I\u2019ve chosen not to share the money as it was my fathers wish. I\u2019ve gotten some really nasty messages from both my brother and sister regarding my decision but my thought process is that it\u2019s understandable to feel a way about our dad but to not even give him the respect of your presence while he\u2019s dying then expecting access to his money when he\u2019s gone is ridiculous, especially after spending years campaigning to get me to cut him off like they did. \n\nI\u2019ve mostly ignored their messages and spoken to them very few times on the phone because they are being really negative and manipulative. I trusted my mother in telling her how much he left me which backfired when I found out she told them even after I specifically asked that she didn\u2019t so now I\u2019m in complete defense mode to all of them regarding this situation\u2026 AITA?", "created_utc": 1673307883, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/107u7h9/aita_for_not_sharing_my_inheritance_with_my/", "score": 134, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They were probably traumatized from his violence. Any money offered while he was alive was a way to exert control over them.", "NTA.

So which is it?\n\nYou pointed out that he wasn't a good man, but good to you. I think it's somewhat unfair to pass judgment against your siblings for not coming to see him when he was dying when you don't know what kind of behavior he was engaging in with them when he was alive, again you stated he wasn't a good man.\n\nI don't like the whole stance about it was my father's wish, blah blah blah, People use that excuse a lot in situations like this, to take the responsibility off of themselve and not be the bad guy. Seriously, you did indicate your dad was not a nice man and look what kind of commotion he has brought into your life with this decision. You quite frankly can't have it both ways, you can't be seen as a nice guy and not give the money It just won't happen, things don't work like that. It's your money now and you're free to do whatever you wish with it. I'm not saying you should or shouldn't share it with them but is it worth losing your family over?

Your father was abusive to your siblings and mother. He treated you like a prince. His last act was to make sure you and your siblings would no longer speak.

Your dad was abusive to your siblings but treated you much better. You are too biased imo, he treated you great so of course you have some nice things to say about him but the ones he abused decided to go no contact and you\u2019re blaming them for not being there for him. I don\u2019t see why you would go by his words when he left it up to you and it seems you already benefited greatly from him. You can\u2019t even take what he says at face value, did you ask them if they turned down his offers of money for college / down payment on houses? I doubt he was being truthful to you considering how awful of a person he sounds like.", "Op, I think your father was actually abusive towards your siblings and mother in order for them to go no contact with them. \"wasn\u2019t the kindest\" is just a euphemism for \"was an asshole\"\n\n>as now I\u2019ve chosen not to share the money as it was my fathers wish.\n\nYou did not share the money because it was your fathers wish, you decided not to share it because you subconsciously want to give the responsibility to your deceased dad and you have not made a decision yet. You have to decide if you want to keep an okay relationship with your siblings and the rest of your family or keep all of the money to yourself. Perhaps you can set aside some of it to help with your nephews/nieces tuition fees or something like that. That way you can keep a relationship with your family and also \"pay respects\" to your old  man. \n\nMake the right choice.", "ESH\n\nSounds like your dad wasn't great with your siblings, had some needed guilt and tried to make up for it with you.

There's not enough info here to decide that. But if it's true they didn't visit while he was dying, they aren't really entitled to much.\n\nYour mom sucks for basically picking sides by outing you.\n\nYou've been put in a bad spot- while your logic is pretty sound around whether or not your siblings deserve the money, your father put you in charge of deciding- which again was a dick move on his part. He did not say \"don't give them the money\" he said _you_ get to decide. Denying your siblings equal shares is still kinda a dick move.\n\nBecause it's your choice you don't have to split it equally if you don't want- do you know what they want? \n\nThe alternative is to donate whatever excess you have so then it's \"fair\" between everyone. \n\nRegardless at the end of the day- it's your choice. You can do whatever you want with the money. But your choices will decide if you have a relationship with the rest of your family. Your logic is still sound- but remember it's not your siblings fault if they were treated poorly and they responded in turn.", "ESH- \n\nYour dad admittedly abused your siblings... And as part of your inheritance he left you with the choice to either enable that abuse or discontinue it.... You've chosen to buy in and continue the abuse for the low low price of a one time inheritance. Congrats to you. \n\nYour siblings blaming you for him being abusive is their choice to. He was abusive all their lives. They can't be shocked that he was abusive in death or that he lied and misled you and convinced you that they deserved to be abused... or that you wouldn't have been conditioned and lied to as well... Which you obviously have been. \n\n\nSooo morally you all are AHs. Just like your dad raised you to be. Good job perpetuating generational trauma to all of you.

They sound like vultures circling. Keep the money, enjoy it.", "NTA. It is your decision.", "NTA\n\nYou always find out who people are with things like this. \n\nHe left it to you because they didn't have any contact with him  nor does it sound like they helped really with him dying or arranging the services.\n\nDo what you want to do with it.", "NTA, your siblings didn\u2019t want to have a relationship with your dad and probably had good reason. It\u2019s weird and inappropriate that they are now wanting his money, even more insane that they are are harassing you for the money. Love your life, find a good financial advisor and make smart investments.", "NTA, if they wanted nothing to do with him, they should have nothing to do with the inheritance. Simple", "NTA because:\n\n1. they set a precedent by rejecting his financial help (as adults) when he was alive, I can understand why they did that at the time but it's odd that they want his help now that he's gone.\n2. They were not excluded in the will, they each got half of a piece of property. It sounds like the property value is not near the amount of cash you were given, but they can't say he gave them nothing.\n3. They pressured you into cutting him off like they did. You didn't, and as a result you have been left this money. I think it's a little hypocritical to ask for the money that you recieved (in part) because you *didn't* take their advice. \n4. The true AH here are not really you or your siblings but, unfortunately, your dad and mom. Mom is an AH for telling your siblings the exact dollar amount when you asked not to. Dad was an AH for showing such blatant favoritism and for posthumously putting the onus of this decision, whether they \"deserve\" it (how tf can he write in his letter that he expects YOU to decide if they should get it!?) on you. He should have either left them some or specifically said that this is your money and yours only. Then, making this decision about sharing the money wouldn't be so stressful as you'd just be fulfilling your own wishes for the money, not his. This is the reason wills exist! It seems like the purpose of the will is defeated if he wrote (paraphrasing obviously) \"this money is for you, I am not giving any to your siblings, but if you think they deserve some that's fine, if you don't that's fine too\" because he's just shoving the choice off on you.", "NTA and I would do the same thing for sure. He offered them help with college and they turned him down and went no contact and didn't show up when he was sick or help with funeral. They wiped their hands clean of him, but expect a share of his money?? I'd tell them all to get bent. Honestly, if it keeps up, as hard as it would be, I would most likely go no contact with them and move on with your life. Deaths always bring out the worst in people and shows their true colours and it's just a total shame.", "I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t believe in an afterlife; because I would hate to think that after:\n\n1. Being a great provider for you. \n2. Always being kind to you. \n3.  Showing you favoritism\n4. Paying for your college. \n5. Being supportive as you worked on your degree. \n6.  Left you a life-changing inheritance.  \n\nHe could look down from Heaven and find out you think so little of him as a father that you don\u2019t even want condolences.", "In my opinion, you\u2019re NTA", "NTA.  He left it to you purposefully which he had a right.  I feel bad for your siblings that they were treated so badly their whole life while you were spared from that so there is a part of me that thinks karma wise, you should consider giving them something.  A 60/20/20 or 50/25/25 or even 80/10/10 might be in order but certainly you are within your right to keep it all. Of course, this will likely be the end of your relationship with your siblings if you do keep it all.", "NTA for keeping the inheritance.\n\nYour dad sure was an AH though. Sounds like he was an AH in life, and even in death he\u2019s managed to probably permanently destroy the relationships between his kids\u2026what a legacy.", "NTA, but be aware that YTA to your siblings. I get why you would keep the money, but it will probably be hard to salvage any relationship with them if you do.  You may have to pick between appeasing them to save the relationship and the money.", "NTA. And they way they've reacted shows exactly why they didn't deserve to be treated the same in the will. \n\nThey sound greedy and as if money is the only thing they were interested in gaining from the death", "NTA i wouldn\u2019t give them anything with the way they constantly treat you. if you want them to be apart of your life you\u2019d have to split but my counter offer would be we split everything then even the property. if thats your prerogative see how it plays out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your father is simply engaging in additional abuse and manipulation from beyond the grave \u2013 only now, you are both benefitting *and* suffering, instead of just benefitting.", "It doesn't, no. The issue here isn't the entitlement- the issue is they know it's your choice. If your father left it to you and didn't say it was up to you then that's that.\n\nBut that's not what happened. Your father didn't exactly cut them out of the will. He made you the will. You are the will. \n\nTo your siblings- you are the will. And you don't want to split it evenly as siblings. We could have many debates on what's right or wrong here, but keeping most of it all for yourself- when again- you are the will- and then remembering that maybe they would have loved to have a father but he didn't give them that option. Knowing that their youngest sibling got a dad they didnt- and then that youngest sibling gets the good memories and money and they dont?\n\nAgain- you are the will. It's your choice. But you will probably not have siblings- the family you have that's alive- if you don't make some sort of compromise. You don't have to even split it evenly. You could offer to buy them each one big ticket item under a certain amount, or donate some or whatever there's options.\n\nThe choice for you is whether you want money or your family. Your siblings aren't the enemy here, your dad put you in a horrible position. But this is the choice he is forcing you to make.", "He was given the choice of whether to keep the money or not, and chose to.  He's directly accountable for that decision.  \n\nHonestly it's not even the greed that does it for me, it's the Pollyannaish hypocrisy of pretending that he was somehow obligated to perpetuate his father's abuse, and that's why he conveniently has to keep all the money.  If he needs the money that much, he should fucking own the decision to keep it instead of hiding behind daddy one last time.", "Um yeah... OP acknowledges that dad was abusive... And thinks that siblings should have tolerated the abuse in order to cash in... And that OP has earned the inheritance by virtue of being the kid Dad brainwashed instead of the kids dad abused... Soooo OP is an AH. They legit think that their siblings should have tolerated abuse and deserved to be abused... And that the reward for being dad's brainwashed kid is a check.\n\nDad left it to OP to decide what to do. OP specifically mentions that they have chosen to not share, even though the dad explicitly gave OP that option. OP specifically mentions punishing them for not honoring their abuser at a funeral. OP also mentions explicitly needing it the least out of everyone  OP is opting to reify the abuse dad started. Thus AH.", "So why would you say he wasn\u2019t a great father?", "I'm not suggesting he do it so that they become some loving family.  Sounds like that ship has sailed long ago.  I'm speaking from a possible moral obligation because of the clear favoritism that he was shown and having a much happier childhood for no other reason than that the dad was an AH.   Also, the other two got some property and it's difficult to assess how much money any of this is to whomever.", "No one is 'all bad' doesn't mean they aren't net horrible.", "I would say they\u2019re that applies to everyone here. \n\nOP wants to keep the benefits of being his abusive asshole father\u2019s golden child, without having to feel bad about perpetuating his siblings abuse, so is suddenly very open about how bad he was (as long as it won\u2019t cost him anything) while suddenly being very concerned with his last wishes and insisting he wasn\u2019t a bad person. \u201cOh it\u2019s not my fault, dad wanted it this way, and yeah that complete asshole deserves to be honored and indulged, I guess I\u2019ll have to bear the burden of this unearned money somehow.\u201d\n\nAsshole abuser dad wanted the absolution of his abuse victims forgiving him, but not enough to actually try to make amends or stop abusing them. His last will was throwing one more tantrum because his abuse victims wouldn\u2019t do what he wanted, while also technically making it OPs choice so he could go to his grave pretending he didn\u2019t perform one more act of abuse.  \u201cOh it\u2019s not my fault, I tried to reconnect with my abuse victims because I know I treated them wrong. Oh, they don\u2019t trust me not to use that as leverage to force them to do what I want and punish them for disobeying me?  Well I guess the best solution is to punish them for disobeying me, since they wouldn\u2019t do what I want to get money.  It\u2019s their fault not mine.\u201d\n\nSiblings wanted an inheritance as recompense for a lifetime of abuse, without having to actually go anywhere near their abuser. Which may be having their cake and eating it to, but can also be pretty reasonably viewed as the absolute least their asshole abuser father could do.  \u201cOur dad continued abusing us with his dying breath, but the person who never had to face his abuse and just got the benefits should have the moral sense to do what he can to make up for it. Oh, he\u2019s suddenly shit talking dad while also keeping the benefits?  Well fuck him too.\u201d\n\nOf the three, the siblings are the only ones who experienced undeserved hardship, so I reserve my sympathy for them. Asshole abuser dad went to his grave being an asshole, and OP is happy to benefit from it. Which his right. But being right doesn\u2019t make him not an asshole. It just also makes him a hypocrite.", "You're right that people would have told them to go NC if they had posted here while their father was alive, but you seemingly don't understand that going No Contact means exactly that, no contact at all. That includes benefiting from the person who they have cut contact with, and they'd absolutely be told that fact if they came here and posted about how they cut off their father (even if it was because he was a bigot or homophobic) for being horrible to them but still expected a bigger portion of his money. Once they cut their father off, they were no longer entitled to inherit any of his wealth. That's why it's advised to actually think about whether it's worth it to go NC or not. In this case they knew their father was wealthy and could have stayed in enough contact to still inherit more but they chose not to do so and even chose to not accept money from him while he was alive, so why should they expect to inherit money from him now that he's dead? They aren't wrong for going NC, but they are wrong for harassing OP for his inheritance when they aren't entitled to it.", ">Everyone here would tell your siblings IN A HEARTBEAT to go NC with your dad but now somehow that advice is screwing them over.\n\nDo you think everyone here would tell them to resent OP, try to make him choose sides as a child, then ostracize him? 'Cause it seems like *that's* what's screwing them over.", "My father is like this. He makes himself look like he's the good guy. In a reality they were empty promises that never amounted to anything. You have to realize your siblings have a different father than you. Sometimes in life you've made shitty decisions. And it comes back on you. They probably don't want his money because it would come with strings attached.", "Shockingly enough, they think that his intention was clearly the one which lead to them keeping all the money.  They're happy to enjoy the benefits of his favoritism without having to bear any of the responsibility for it.", "Yeah I was thinking of leaving some money out for my brothers kids or something thoughtful like that instead of giving it directly to either of my siblings tbh", "He doesn't have them now and he won't have them later. OP should just wake away from them all. They didn't want to help him plan the funeral or even attend it. All of a sudden, they want money now.", "I need it the least definitely in terms of the fact that they are homeowners and have kids and stuff sure but it\u2019s also not like I have no right to the money. Im less \u201cbrainwashed\u201d I think I had an entirely different experience with my dad though which is why I say I can understand them feel a way about dad but I mean he tried to rectify his actions and they wouldn\u2019t meet him halfway.", "He wasn\u2019t a great dad and that\u2019s just the truth. He wasn\u2019t a bad person but most certainly was not a good father, the qualities definitely overlap in some ways but the terms are certainly not synonymous.", "Dad: \"I offered them help and they refused, I can't imagine why, they're so ungrateful.\n\nSiblings: \"He offered to loan us the money for school, if we went to the school he chose, pursued the major he chose, and gave him veto power over any life choices we made, on penalty of being cut off and having to immediately pay back the money.\"\n\nOP: \"Well he OFFERED them HELP.\"", "That's a very fair compromise!", "Honey, that's why it's called brainwashing. And that's why it was effective. He used you and his treatment of you to mock and punish and bait your siblings. And you, because you weren't treated horribly by him think that he was just plain wonderful to you so obviously he couldn't have been so horrible to them. See, brainwashing. \n\nWhen someone keeps slapping you over and over again... You stop showing them the other cheek and hoping they stop slapping you. They met him more than halfway for years... For 18 years as children as a matter of fact and beyond apparently. And he NEVER stopped emotionally if not physically slapping them. There was no halfway for them to travel. There was only his way... \n\nAnd that's why it's brainwashing. Cause you think 'hey i know I've always been horrible to you and demonstrated that for decades but like just come over here AGAIN and i won't be horible' was a genuine option. It wasn't.\n\nHe never treated your siblings the way he treated you and he was never going to. And he didn't even once he was dead. He just offered you the opportunity to treat them as lesser than you and to judge them.. and you took it. It was a trap, and you don't see it.\n\nHe explicitly gave you the opportunity to right his wrongs. To split things equally. Instead you doubled down on his bad behavior and decided they deserved less. That's the trap. He just made you carry out his last act of mistreatment & favoritism.", "What on earth makes you think that after a lifetime of abuse, his attempts to rectify his actions were sincere? \n\nIf he felt actual remorse for his abuse of your siblings, then he would have left money to them equally (at the least), instead of performing one more act of abuse.  That indicates that his attempts at reconciliation had nothing to do with remorse, and instead were about a selfish desire to be given absolution, or more likely wanting to have more opportunity to abuse them.  \n\nYou can't simultaneously acknowledge \"Well yeah, he was terrible to them,\" and then stick your fingers in your ears and go \"lalala he wasn't that bad, they're unreasonable, if it's not his fault it's not my fault, lalala.\"  Acknowledgment of abuse is meaningless when you have the opportunity to rectify it and pass.", "Like I said, I laid out a lot of really good things he did for you. So, it\u2019s surprising to hear that he wasn\u2019t a great dad after everything he did for you. No dad is perfect.", "Yeah and this is a fair assessment of the situation. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ignorant of the fact that he wasn\u2019t god to them but what I do know is the person that I saw later in life genuinely wanted to right his wrongs and maybe it was too little too late but I do know he died with a lot of regret in his heart for how he treated them.\n\nI Guess its just more difficult for me to understand because he was such an integral part of my life, they made the decision to go no contact with him and that\u2019s fine and fair but when he dies why should anything change is really the mindset?\n\nI can\u2019t defend my dad because I agree he wasn\u2019t great but I genuinely don\u2019t think he was a BAD PERSON, not a good dad sure.\n\nOf everything I\u2019ve read this softened my heart the most in terms of actual sharing the money with them but it\u2019s honestly not even about the money for me, ours about the way they treated me then and even now.", "Most dads aren\u2019t serial cheaters, most dads aren\u2019t mentally physically and verbally abusive to their children.

It's hard because you know a very different person. A person they absolutely never knew and would never know. And they really never had a shot at knowing, despite protests and wishes to the contrary. \n\nAnd there isn't an explanation of why... There isn't a reason why he targeted them and supported you.... Both things are likely true at the same time. And that hurts. It hurts everyone. \n\nThe way they treated you was really messed up, but is part of that same trap... The trap your dad laid for your siblings is in blaming YOU for what he did.... And he set them up to fall into that trap by making this YOUR CHOICE. So he trapped them too. \n\nHonestly, consider sitting down and talking about how much of a set up this whole thing was. Lay out the traps. The traps that keep you separate, the traps that make them seem lesser... The traps that separate you from your family... And talk about whether or not you all want to do as your dad set up you to do (argue and not know each other) or combat the traps and break the cycle (figure out who each of you actually are without him sabotaging your relationships). Propose a rule: we don't talk about dad until we've all actually known each other for a year. He's gone and arguing about the various ways he treated you, defending them or not is kind of the root of you all not speaking at all.\n\nAvoid the trap of letting one man control the relationships in your entire family. Give each other grace to be imperfect and hurt.\n\nIf you genuinely believe your dad wanted to make things right. Than make it right. Split it equally. He told you he was okay with that.\n\nThe moral of the story can be, if you make it so, that all of you -equally- deserved better.", "Thanks for including important information.", "This needs to be included in the original post.
