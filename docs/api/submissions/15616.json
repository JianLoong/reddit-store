Your AH status will depend on how you react to the consequences of your decision.\n\n>Obviously, with that comes irresponsible dog owners who don\u2019t clean up after their pets and leave poop in the grassy areas. [...] After a few emails reminding people to clean up after their pets...\n\nWhile you said you didn't think it was a big problem, it's enough that the rental company had to send out *several* emails about it. This means that residents were complaining. People aren't always going to admit to random neighbors how much something bothers them, but you bet they'll tell management. It's possible you may not know how much this is driving other people nuts and forcing the complex to institute new policies so they don't lose residents. \n\nThere are a ***TON*** of apartment complexes in my area that require the dog DNA test, and have something like a $40 fee per instance if they catch you leaving dog poop everywhere. I think part of it is psychological; they're not going to test every poop but if you know you could feasibly get caught you're less likely to be a shitty dog owner (pun intended). None of the places I know of actually try to \"catch\" people in scenarios that are obviously more logistically difficult to pick up, (ex. dog had the runs, or you missed a spot)--- at least where I live they're not looking for excuses to fine people, they just want to keep the ruling majority of residents happy with the overall experience living there and believe these policies will dissuade bad behavior. \n\n\nIf dog poop is making some residents (especially non-pet-owners) move out in favor of less pet friendly complexes that don't have poop problems, your complex is just trying to figure out a solution *other* than banning pets altogether that will enable them to stay competitive in the rental market. A lot of people like to lounge in the grass in a little park at my complex and hang out barefoot in the summer--- stepping in poo would definitely impact general enjoyment in my park. I have a 90lb dog and it's hard to find places that allow dogs over ~50lb that aren't completely rundown craphole apartments. I know my choices are more limited because I have a pet and I accept that I have additional responsibility and requirements for accountability because of it. (Like you I'm a stickler about always picking up poop, but I don't mind doing the DNA thing if I like the complex I'm living at.)\n\nYou need to check your lease because pet clauses are often pretty fluid where the complex has a lot of power to kick out a pet on 3 days' notice if you're not compliant with property policies that are \"subject to change\" at any time--- like the introduction of this DNA test midway into your lease. Pets are not protected from eviction in the same ways that people are.\n\n I don't think this is really an AITA question to be honest.  It really comes down to, is this the hill you're willing to die on? Are you ok if you refuse and the landlords likewise refuse to renew your lease because of it? They can and probably will do that so don't be surprised if that happens. NAH *ONLY* if you're willing to ***accept that there will be consequences to your decision***, and probably not ones you're going to like. At *minimum*, at the end of your lease you will need to move somewhere that has policies you're willing to comply with. (If your landlords don't move forward with revoking your pet clause before then, which they can do.)\n\nTL;DR- In terms of your lease, you are approaching the intersection where Fuck Around meets Find Out. It's up to you.", "YTA. Also, here's the thing--they don't actually do it. They're not actually testing the dog's DNA. They're just scaring you into thinking they are so you pick up your dog's poop. It's an extremely effective tool to keep apartment complexes cleaner.", "Yta. The apartment complex I live in did this. They didn\u2019t charge to do the test and I verified with the company doing the test that they weren\u2019t testing for the type of dog. It has helped clean up the mess as in not as much dog poop around. Plus I have heard from management after so many times they have enough to evict people cause it\u2019s in the lease.", "YTA\n\nHaving a dog in the apartment complex is a privilege, and you have to respect their requirements as it's their property.

You might not be an asshole, but it's pretty foolish to refuse if this is in fact a new and mandatory requirement for residents.\n\nAre they asking you to cover the cost of the DNA test? If not, what exactly is your objection here? And have they said what the consequence is for refusal?", "You don't present any reasons whatsoever for not wanting to give your dogs' DNA. The only conclusion this leads me to is that you know that you've left dog poop before. Which leads me to the YTA verdict.\n\nBut you can certainly change my mind if you explain yourself.", "Stuff like this confirms that I will never go back to living in the city again.

You don\u2019t get to pick and choose what parts of a legal contract you comply with.  This dog DNA testing is fairly common actually\u2014and the coats of testing is passed to the offender.

The goal is for the apartment complex to fine the owner as a disciplinary action. I\u2019ve lived in an apartment complex that did that and it\u2019s really not that big of a deal. It takes 2 seconds to do, and you don\u2019t have to pay for the initial testing. \n\nSure it\u2019s an extreme measure\u2026but do you actually have a valid reason to not bring your dog in for a quick swab of the cheek?

It\u2019s a weird hill to die on, if you have nothing to hide there\u2019s no reason to not give them a swab. \n\nIf your concerned about it being used for any other reason (outlawing bully breeds in the building, whatever) ask for the specifics of the contract. I\u2019m pretty sure the company\u2019s that do this just check for a match. They are not giving you a breed profile or any other identifying type stuff.

Every dog has to be swabbed and registered. The owners get charged when they are caught.", "This was my first thought when I heard about the whole \u201cDNA for dog poop\u201d thing.  My daughters apartment started doing this.  Is poop ever really that bad??    I would be protesting like crazy if they ever used it for dog breed discrimination but it\u2019s getting so mainstream to give up a dogs DNA.", "The main company that does this in the US does not test for breed. I used to work at a lab that worked for them.", "I wish wish my apartment would start doing this :( I'm so tired of the shit every day and it's clearly the same people who never pick it up", "I have a pitbull and I am 100% in favor of shit testing because, yes, the shit problem really is that bad in a lot of places. It's disgusting and I'm tired of people thinking they can just leave it every day\n\nIf the apartment wants to ban breeds, they can just say so and pick and choose based on appearance. They don't need a DNA test to be haters.", "We didn\u2019t have to pay for it (although I guess we did through our rent lol), unless someone left poop. So part of the fine was the cost of the test. I\u2019d never pay for it voluntarily!", "Wow, my complexes bounty is cheap, lol. $25 gift card per photo with ours.", "Not to mention you'd be relying on the office staff to recognize every tenant by name based on the grainy footage. The complex I live in has over 700 units, definitely at least a couple thousand tenants... There's no way whoever is watching the video is going to be able to name the offenders!", "YTA. If you're a responsible dog owner, you won't get fined. My HOA rates have actually gone up because it's expensive for them to hire dog shit removal companies to clean everything up. They recently implemented the same policy and I've noticed a lot less dog shit around the common areas.", "I guarantee you they won't do this. They're just putting out a threat so that people pick up after their dogs. I can't imagine how much it would cost to sample and process every dogshit you find in your yard. They're bluffing. NTA", "NTA. This is quite ridiculous.  Are you expected to pay for these tests, or will strata make everyone pay for it? \n\nI would suggest security cameras placed in these public areas instead. \n\nI would also talk to a vet about how accurate these tests would actually be.", "I'm sorry this is happening, because I'm cackling at this!\n\nCSI Dog Shit?\n\nThey're absolute jokers.\n\nAnd where's the funding for all this DNA testing coming from? The property management fee? If so, what a massive misuse of funds.\n\nI'm tempted to suggest you send in the DNA from human poo as a protest, but I'm too old for those shenanigans now.\n\nWhat ever happened to putting up CCTV!\n\nVery much NTA.", "As long as you clean up after your dog, and it sounds like you do, NTA. Ignore their silly game.", "NTA if it wasn't in the lease and now they want to do so. If it was in the lease you signed them you have to", "unpopular opinion, but i don\u2019t care if dog owners leave the poop on the ground. but i\u2019m also someone who avoids dogs as much as i can, and i look where i\u2019m going so i don\u2019t step in shit\n\nNTA. perhaps the complex should build a tiny dog park area where residents can bring their dogs and provide bags and trash cans if they want people to pick up the shit so badly. and put up cameras to catch those who don\u2019t use the dog park", "NTA.", "YTA because based on how ur not giving any reasoning as to why you wouldn\u2019t want your dog\u2019s DNA tested, you\u2019re probably the culprits", "NTA this is nuts !", "No judgment here lol like I'm not going to call you ta for thinking this is crazy but damn do I wish I had this at my condo because people are disgusting and they just let their dogs poop everywhere. Kids can't even play on the grass.", "YTA- you don\u2019t want your dog tested because you\u2019re the one leaving the poop everywhere.", "NTA.  This is the real reason for DNA tests.  Dog racial profiling.  Identifying who is not cleaning up after their dogs could be solved by hiring on site security or a few strategically placed cameras.  Requiring dog DNA tests is absurd, inefficient, and not cost effective. \n\nAlso, check your lease.  If the DNA test is not a stipulation in your lease, you may have legal grounds to refuse testing until your lease is up for renewal.  Also, the lanlord should ve paying for every DNA test.  They also should be paying to test every fecal sample from the nesses that are not cleaned up by owners.", "eh, we do it here. you can have any breed of cat/dog/bunny/guinea pig etc but have their breed/name/weight marked. dogs get tested for poop because we had an issue with shitty owners, then they tried to claim racism even though it\u2019s written in spanish and english", "My thought exactly", "Interesting moral and philosophical question here I feel in that it\u2019s ok for a landlord to deceive its tenants regarding security and enforcement practices when it\u2019s for public health.", "If it was stated as a requirement before moving in I could see it, but not as a requirement added after the fact.", "What\u2019s a reasonable price for something like this?", "There very much is, cells. are sloughed off as waste makes it's way through.", "I'm astounded your neighbor actually submitted their dog's DNA profile and then still left poop behind.", "I see what you\u2019re saying, but unless the term of the lease is \u201cforever\u201d they can just add the requirement come renewal time (or refuse to renew) in many places."]}
