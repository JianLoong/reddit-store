Your AH status will depend on how you react to the consequences of your decision.\n\n>Obviously, with that comes irresponsible dog owners who don\u2019t clean up after their pets and leave poop in the grassy areas. [...] After a few emails reminding people to clean up after their pets...\n\nWhile you said you didn't think it was a big problem, it's enough that the rental company had to send out *several* emails about it. This means that residents were complaining. People aren't always going to admit to random neighbors how much something bothers them, but you bet they'll tell management. It's possible you may not know how much this is driving other people nuts and forcing the complex to institute new policies so they don't lose residents. \n\nThere are a ***TON*** of apartment complexes in my area that require the dog DNA test, and have something like a $40 fee per instance if they catch you leaving dog poop everywhere. I think part of it is psychological; they're not going to test every poop but if you know you could feasibly get caught you're less likely to be a shitty dog owner (pun intended). None of the places I know of actually try to \"catch\" people in scenarios that are obviously more logistically difficult to pick up, (ex. dog had the runs, or you missed a spot)--- at least where I live they're not looking for excuses to fine people, they just want to keep the ruling majority of residents happy with the overall experience living there and believe these policies will dissuade bad behavior. \n\n\nIf dog poop is making some residents (especially non-pet-owners) move out in favor of less pet friendly complexes that don't have poop problems, your complex is just trying to figure out a solution *other* than banning pets altogether that will enable them to stay competitive in the rental market. A lot of people like to lounge in the grass in a little park at my complex and hang out barefoot in the summer--- stepping in poo would definitely impact general enjoyment in my park. I have a 90lb dog and it's hard to find places that allow dogs over ~50lb that aren't completely rundown craphole apartments. I know my choices are more limited because I have a pet and I accept that I have additional responsibility and requirements for accountability because of it. (Like you I'm a stickler about always picking up poop, but I don't mind doing the DNA thing if I like the complex I'm living at.)\n\nYou need to check your lease because pet clauses are often pretty fluid where the complex has a lot of power to kick out a pet on 3 days' notice if you're not compliant with property policies that are \"subject to change\" at any time--- like the introduction of this DNA test midway into your lease. Pets are not protected from eviction in the same ways that people are.\n\n I don't think this is really an AITA question to be honest.  It really comes down to, is this the hill you're willing to die on? Are you ok if you refuse and the landlords likewise refuse to renew your lease because of it? They can and probably will do that so don't be surprised if that happens. NAH *ONLY* if you're willing to ***accept that there will be consequences to your decision***, and probably not ones you're going to like. At *minimum*, at the end of your lease you will need to move somewhere that has policies you're willing to comply with. (If your landlords don't move forward with revoking your pet clause before then, which they can do.)\n\nTL;DR- In terms of your lease, you are approaching the intersection where Fuck Around meets Find Out. It's up to you.", "YTA. Also, here's the thing--they don't actually do it. They're not actually testing the dog's DNA. They're just scaring you into thinking they are so you pick up your dog's poop.

They didn\u2019t charge to do the test and I verified with the company doing the test that they weren\u2019t testing for the type of dog.

You might not be an asshole, but it's pretty foolish to refuse if this is in fact a new and mandatory requirement for residents.\n\nAre they asking you to cover the cost of the DNA test? If not, what exactly is your objection here? And have they said what the consequence is for refusal?", "You don't present any reasons whatsoever for not wanting to give your dogs' DNA.

You don\u2019t get to pick and choose what parts of a legal contract you comply with.  This dog DNA testing is fairly common actually\u2014and the coats of testing is passed to the offender.

It's disgusting and I'm tired of people thinking they can just leave it every day\n\nIf the apartment wants to ban breeds, they can just say so and pick and choose based on appearance. They don't need a DNA test to be haters.", "We didn\u2019t have to pay for it (although I guess we did through our rent lol), unless someone left poop. So part of the fine was the cost of the test. I\u2019d never pay for it voluntarily!", "Wow, my complexes bounty is cheap, lol. $25 gift card per photo with ours.", "Not to mention you'd be relying on the office staff to recognize every tenant by name based on the grainy footage. The complex I live in has over 700 units, definitely at least a couple thousand tenants... There's no way whoever is watching the video is going to be able to name the offenders!", "YTA. If you're a responsible dog owner, you won't get fined. My HOA rates have actually gone up because it's expensive for them to hire dog shit removal companies to clean everything up. They recently implemented the same policy and I've noticed a lot less dog shit around the common areas.", "I guarantee you they won't do this. They're just putting out a threat so that people pick up after their dogs. I can't imagine how much it would cost to sample and process every dogshit you find in your yard. They're bluffing.

Are you expected to pay for these tests, or will strata make everyone pay for it? \n\nI would suggest security cameras placed in these public areas instead. \n\nI would also talk to a vet about how accurate these tests would actually be.", "I'm sorry this is happening, because I'm cackling at this!\n\nCSI Dog Shit?\n\nThey're absolute jokers.\n\nAnd where's the funding for all this DNA testing coming from? The property management fee? If so, what a massive misuse of funds.\n\nI'm tempted to suggest you send in the DNA from human poo as a protest, but I'm too old for those shenanigans now.\n\nWhat ever happened to putting up CCTV!\n\nVery much NTA.", "As long as you clean up after your dog, and it sounds like you do, NTA.

Dog racial profiling.  Identifying who is not cleaning up after their dogs could be solved by hiring on site security or a few strategically placed cameras.  Requiring dog DNA tests is absurd, inefficient, and not cost effective. \n\nAlso, check your lease.  If the DNA test is not a stipulation in your lease, you may have legal grounds to refuse testing until your lease is up for renewal.  Also, the lanlord should ve paying for every DNA test.

There's only one reason you'd not play ball with this.", "NTA\n\nMy complex has the issue with people leaving dog poop in random places.

Or with the next tenant .. whichever is easier.", "The problem is, mixed breeds may have 15% Pitbull/whatever that wouldn't show up in appearance but might be enough for the complex to be like 'nuh uh dangerous dog!!' the DNA test would allow for discrimination in a whole different way.", "another thing you need to consider is I'll be taking my neighbor's dog poo out of the garbage and planting it in the complex. I really dislike dogs but that one is the worst of them.", "You bring up intesting points. Nowadays, you can get one decent outdoor surveillance camera for under $30. Buying in bulk, you could buy dozens for the cost of a single doggy DNA test (maybe 2). Adjusting the iso setting and mounting them near lit walkways would eliminate almost all graininess. Plus, facial recognition software is incredibly advanced and becoming cheaper daily as governments all over the world use it for myriad purposes. The one-time cost to procure this equipment would definitely be far cheaper than the recurring costs of initially collecting DNA, then repeatedly gathering and testing turds. \n\nAlso, you could just outsource the video reviews and have a team of overseas poop watchers for less than the cost of one domestic fecal footage viewer. You'd really only need to email the video files to the dung observers, and by using the facial recognition software, they could match the people to the pets to easily find the offending defecation bandits. With this method, you could rather easily identify thousands of potential stool offenders in even the largest apt complexes. I think I may have created the most advanced canine excrement detection system that is considerably cheaper than the current methodology....", "Mostly poop and circumstance more like", "I was thinking the same. Maybe they do test a few here and there to make the scare belivable.", "You knowing the name is a VERY GOOD indicator that it does not happen very often, so you can feel safe.

Cue tips are cheap and for a little while will convince an owner to be responsible.  Getting every poop tested when dna tests are usually about 40 dollars would be extremely expensive.", "NTA this is aggressive. And weird. Why can\u2019t they just install cameras? I feel like it would be super expensive to constantly be DNA testing dog crap. I\u2019m sorry but wtf?? Seriously so weird.", "Isn't it better to install cameras in those common areas than checking dog poop ?\nThis is insanity, NTA", "NTA.

NTA", "YTA, poo prints is very commonly used at apartment complexes. I work part-time at a complex and they aren\u2019t looking for breeds to ban, they legit just want the poop problem gone. It is paid by the person who owns the dog as well as a fine for not cleaning up. It works really well at keeping the problem at a minimum.", "Would suck to be a full time dog shit tester.", "YTA if you refuse. Why are you against it? If you know you clean up after your dog and the test is free for you then do so.  Yes it may be annoying if in the case where you do pick up after your dog but other dog owners don't but at the end of the day people who don't have pets shouldn't have to suffer because of lazy pet owners.", "That seriously sounds like the best thing ever?

Definitely shocked that your apartment complex is this invested in analyzing dog shit. NTA. This does sound insane.", "That's not how these DNA testing services work. The association doesn't get a report on the dog's DNA makeup. It is like entering a fingerprint into a database with the service. If someone isn't picking up after their dog, a sample of the poop is sent to the service, who then let's you know if there is a match to a known entry in their system. That's it. We use it in our neighborhood.", "Not likely, I lived in a complex that used this same method. It was an upper class area, so they had money", "a place i looked at had dog dna testing and it would cost me $50 to get the test done. so it didn\u2019t cost the apartment complex any money. they, however would fine you $100 if they found dog poop on the ground. so it might be for checking breeds but it\u2019s also money for them if they can fine you for finding poop.", "It would be cheaper than paying someone to sit in front of a monitor watching surveillance tapes all day, then attempting to identify the person on the tape", "Wouldn't testing each turd and matching with resident dogs cost a lot of money? It's bonkers. Putting up cameras to see who's not picking up the shit is slightly less insane. NTA.", "Yes, I moved from an apartment complex that used Poo Prints, it was amazing. They understood if a dog had diarrhea, they just asked that you told them so the cleaning staff could clean it up with the hose. I never stepped in a single poo when living there. \n\nI now live in a luxury apartment. We pay $2600 a month for a two bedroom apartment. They legitimately pick up trash nightly from your door so that you don\u2019t have to walk it to the trash chute yourself. I admit it, we are spoiled and it could be so much worse. \n\nHowever, the place is being ruined by irresponsible pet owners. It\u2019s not unusual to find dog poop or pee in the carpeted stairwells. Outside theres always at least three piles of poop. The complex has 2-3 dog waste stations on each side of the apartments, complete with free bags and trash cans. And they have regular trash cans in between those. And yet some pet owners still don\u2019t care. I won\u2019t even get into how gross the sand volleyball court is.\n\nI\u2019ve asked why they don\u2019t use poo prints or a similar company and they say that they prefer to use the honor system.\n\nI\u2019m moving in a month and I\u2019m going back to a house. My husband and I owned a home for 10+ years and selling it was so stressful that we decided we would just rent apartments until we are ready to retire.

Especially in a complex- you have people with health issues that don't need to be stepping in it and traipsing in unknown bacteria, it smells, it's disgusting, and people need to be responsible for their pets.  One place I lived in - the park was across the street and we had a side entrance to the garbage area but every winter the front pathway would be pure yellow frozen pee ice and poop they obviously tried to cover with snow, as when it melted it was just a shitstorm - literally.  Besides slipping on the constant frozen pee, it looking disgusting, as someone immunocompromised and with mobility issues that flared up, you couldn't get in without stepping in SOMETHING because lazy pet owners couldn't be bothered to cross the street or go out by the trashcans and hten pick it up.", "When they get a DNA match from the poop to a dog in database,  they fine the owner the cost of the testing. \n\nCameras require more storage and man power on site than outsourcing DNA testing.

Your dogs DNA is more private than literally everything that happens on the street?", "Dogs don't get human rights like privacy.\nThe dog barely gets to decide where and when to shit.\n\nThe only thing they can do with the dna is test turds and fine the owners of the dog who did it.", "It's a dog.", "The dog licks its own balls and can\u2019t read, I hardly think it cares about whether its data ends up somewhere or that it considers anything invasive.", "Not equivalent at all. Dogs don't have the same privacy protection as people, they do not need it. My dog's biggest secret is where he hides my socks. Dog DNA data doesn't have the same worth as human DNA data.

Well, sure, bad gun owners are the ones committing crimes and shooting people (just like bad dog owners produce bad dogs).
