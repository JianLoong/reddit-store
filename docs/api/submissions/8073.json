The thing is, she hates surprises and hates being the center of attention. She hates it so much that she actually made us plan a vacation for her birthday so that no one would try to throw her a big party or surprise party. \n\nWell, as it turns out, her parents don't care and want to throw her a surprise party for a date before our vacation. They're extremely good people to us, but they are very bad about respecting our decisions on things. They're very pushy and tend to do things against our will as they think they're doing the right thing and making us happy. We basically had two weddings because they weren't happy that our first one was a smaller, backyard wedding (due to covid). My wife and I loved the small wedding and were completely happy with that being that. We told them we don't need a second one but they basically forced us to have one because they wanted family to come that couldn't go to the original. Long rant, but just explaining how they are sometimes. \n\nNow, I'm conflicted on this because I know that my wife *deserves* a nice party and the spotlight, but I know that she does not *want* to have those things. Would I be TA if I briefed her on what's going on? I'm thinking about at least letting her know it's coming without giving away any major details. As far as her parents are involved, I'll be doing everything in my power to make sure they don't turn it into a huge event as they always try to do. So far her mom has not listened to me, but I'll be diligent.\n\nEdit: Wifey has been informed of the party and was relieved to hear about it. She had a suspicion they would do it anyway, so we've just eliminated stress on her building up to her birthday week. I told her she's 100% in control of how much information she wants to know about it and if she wants out, I'll put my foot down. She actually seems into the idea now that it's not a surprise or anything huge. \n\nIn the meantime, I'll play along with the MIL and make sure things stay reasonable. Thanks for everyone's advice. I literally have never gone to reddit for advice before but this one I needed some honest feedback haha.", "created_utc": 1674486420, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jelv9/aita_if_i_tell_my_wife_about_a_surprise_party/", "score": 323, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Having time to mentally prepare would be key for her and I'm sure she can put on a good show of being surprised.", "NTA.  You know she would hate to be surprised, so tell her.  But also, it sounds like your wife needs to do a better job of setting boundaries with her parents.", "NTA, and you definitely should do this, but in terms of HOW you tell her I'd suggest having a thought over which situation is going to cause least upset, because it all depends on the character of your wife:\n\nScenario 1: You tell your wife in secret from her parents, and suggest to her that she pretends to be surprised and delighted. This allows her to prepare herself mentally for the day, but also gives all the guests and her parents the thrill of surprising her. I'd go for this option if your wife doesn't like surprise parties because of the \"surprise\" element rather than the \"party\" element.\n\nScenario 2: You tell your wife's parents that under no circumstances should this go ahead, and that you will tell your wife yourself on X date if they haven't put the brakes on the whole plan by then. I'd go for this route only if the \"party\" aspect is the thing that would stress her out, because this way will of course cause more friction between yourself and your parents in law, which I'm assuming your wife would not want.", "NTA. Your loyalty should always be to your wife. 100%. She should know you have her back no matter what. Your in-laws \u201cwould do anything\u201d for you guys, except respect your wishes.

Please tell your wife. I would hate to have a surprise party thrown for me and if my husband knew about it and didn't at least give me the heads-up I'd be pissed.", "YWNBTA. And please, please have a sit down with your in-laws about boundaries. Your in-laws wanting to go above and beyond for you sounds great in theory, but these things build up and add strain when they aren\u2019t addressed.", "NTA. Tell her. She has a very simple, very understable boundary and her parents are refusing to follow it. Tell your wife what they're planning and tell them to knock it off. If they are continually doing things against your will they are not good to you, regardless of how much they believe they're in the right.", "NTA. Her parents are not extremely good to you if they have no respect for your boundries and requests. They are treating you like their pets or dolls not like people.\n\nTell her. Tell them you told her, and tell them if that if they continue to try and do things to you that you do not wish for, you'll regretfully have to distance yourselves.", "NTA. But you should also just tell her parents that your telling her and tell them why your telling her. It sounds like she would hate it so her parents have no right to force that on her. It sounds like her parents are throwing this party to please themselves rather than to please her.", "NTA.  This is a pattern of behaviour that doubtless causes your wife great pain and has done her entire life.  There's nothing good or kind about the in-laws' intentions and they don't deserve to be honoured.", "Deserves? How does your wife deserve this level of mistreatment? How exactly is going against her wishes helpful for her? No, what she deserves is a spouse who will stand up for her and with her, someone who will put their foot down and say no to manipulation. Her parents can\u2019t make you do anything. Why do her parents opinions matter more to you than your own wife? You should definitely tell your wife, so the two of you can make plans together to avoid this ambush.", "NTA but it sounds like your in-laws need a lesson in \u201cit\u2019s not about them.\u201d I still wouldn\u2019t tell her about the party, but do your best to get them to drop the surprise portion - you likely know your wife better than they do at this point. If you KNOW it is going to cause major anxiety, you may need to drop some very big hints to your wife.", "NTA to brief her.  But it\u2019s her side of the family so she is in charge of the confrontation", "NTA. Not one bit. You know she won't like it, so you're preparing her. It's the nice thing to do.", "NTA. You know your wife hates these things and you\u2019re coming from a good place in wanting to tell her.", "NTA\nI HATE surprises. Hate hate hate. I have a nog birthday coming up soon and if my partner knew somebody was planning a party for me and didn't tell me. I would be MAD at him! My in-laws sang at me one year, in a restaurant, for my birthday. I don't go out with them any time near my birthday now. It's embarrassing and awkward and ridiculous to force an adult to be the centre of attention when they don't want it. Save her, please.", "NTA, but if you're right and she says she doesn't want it, you two need to make sure they know you aren't coming. They can't force you to participate, you just always give in after they apply enough pressure. They will keep applying more and more pressure until they find the point where you give in. Extinction bursts suck, but they are necessary to get to the other side.", "YWNBTA. You have effectively been put in the position where you need to pick loyalties. Are you more loyal to your In-Laws (stated) wish for secrecy, or your Wife's (assumed) wish to not have surprise parties? I guess your first loyalty has to be to your wife. \n\nHowever, be aware that your in-laws will definitely consider you to be an a-hole if you tell her, no matter how justified you feel. You can reduce this, perhaps, by at least informing the in-laws that you intend to tell your wife. But you are unlikely to get any thanks from them. \n\nAlso, do some soul searching to check how sure you are that this would be your wife's wish - you would, after all, be spoiling the surprise. Maybe do an honesty check with yourself to confirm that it is not just that YOU would hate this to happen to YOU.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't know if your wife has it to that extent but you make it pretty apparent that something like this has far more downsides than upsides by not telling your wife.\n\nThe worst that can happen is that you 'ruin' the surprise if you tell her. The worst that can happen if you don't tell her is that she is upset you hid it from her and it ruins your vacation or creates conflict between the two of you.", "NTA. Tell your wife, and make plans for yourselves for that day. Don't let her parents keep persuading you into stuff that neither of you want to do. \n\nAnd tell her parents that your wife has expressed her wishes perfectly clearly - she does not want a party and will not be attending a party. As such, you will be giving her the celebration she wants, and not spoiling it for her by disrespecting her wishes.", "NTA please tell her. I'm like your wife in that a surprise party in my honour is my idea of hell. If I found out that my partner knew ahead of time and didn't give me any warning I would be very hurt and upset.", "NTA. I also hate surprise parties and I would absolutely want to be told. As you said, start just with that it's happening and then she can decide how many details she wants or if she wants to talk to her parents about it.", "NTA, you already know she hates surprises like this. Her parents should know it too but decide to do one anyway, so they're doing the surprise party for themselves not for your wife.", "NTA, but you need to do more than tell her. Her parents refuse to respect your boundaries. As good as they are to you, the more you let them ride roughshod over you, the harder it will be to set boundaries for really important things, like if you have children. Suggest couples therapy to your wife so you can develop ways to kindly but firmly set and hold boundaries with them together.", "NTA. It seems that your intentions of informing her are due to your support, respect and loyalty to your wife, the subject of the party, because you actually listen to your wife and value her voice. I think your wife will be nothing less than appreciative of you informing her of her family's disregarding her long standing desire to avoid surprises.\n\nMy partner's family is filled with kind people who mean well but are completely clueless to their semi consistent resistance to our wishes for everything WE choose as a unified front. We are constantly put in situations we don't want to be in, despite active efforts to avoid predictable bs. This is why we are both very careful about what we share with who and never agree to anything without consulting each other. Your wedding reality was my concern which is exactly why nobody knows we are married. \n\nI say tell her. It'll only strengthen her trust in you to protect her from the willful ignorance of her family.", "How are you, as adults, letting your parents bully you into an unwanted birthday party and a whole ass second wedding? YTA for not being able to set and enforce limits.", "NTA, but you need to tell your wife everything asap. This is not an acceptable way for her parents to behave toward their adult married daughter. If you two do not come together with a plan to end this manipulative boundary stomping just think of how bad it will get when children come into the picture. Seriously by consistently giving in you're consenting to and enabling their inappropriate behavior in your life. That is not minimizing damages it is lacking the tools necessary to communicate that no is a complete answer.  These people are narcissists, they aren't doing these things for you, they are doing them to you. One because they enjoy being the actual center of attention and two because being in control makes them feel good, and if it makes you uncomfortable that makes it even better for them.", "NTA.\n\nI'm a lot like your wife, and I'd be *beyond* pissed if I knew my husband saw this coming and didn't at least tell me so I could prepare for it. \n\nGiving her a heads up will at least allow her to prepare herself for it. She can wear something she likes if that's important to her, do her hair or whatever makes her feel good, take the time to rest as much as she needs to beforehand and plan downtime after, etc. \n\nAnd definitely keep working on her parents, unless she decides this is it and she's blowing up the whole thing and finally tell them she's done showing up to shit she doesn't want to go to.\n\nMy MIL loved throwing surprise parties. I haaaaate being surprised. I told her if she threw me a surprise bridal shower I'd leave. She asked my now-husband if I was serious and he was like \"idk, mom, but do you really want to find out the embarrassing way?\" \n\nI did not have any surprise showers, or any other surprise parties.", "NTA from someone just like your wife in this regard.\n\nI think you've measured it right, heads up but no details unless she asks.\n\nIf she doesn't want to have the party, you could always fall back on it being the *day before your vacation* as an additional reason not to go as they're not respecting her boundaries.\n\n*\"Sorry! Couldn't stop the wife from getting me involved in all these chores. We're all sweaty and dirty now and it'll be suspicious if I try and get her showered and ready, plus we'll be late. What?

I hate surprises as well and would appreciate the heads up. You don't have to give a ton of details but she will probably appreciate a little warning to get herself mentally prepared. \n\nMy BFF knows how much I hate surprises and has taken the time to give me a very low-detail heads up about 2 surprise birthday events some other friends planned for me. All she told me is that there would be a surprise and when; I got to be surprised by the actual event but I was mentally prepared and dressed correctly for the occasion.", "NTA. \n\nYour wife sounds just like me! I would not be happy if my DH knew about this and didn\u2019t give me a heads up so I could figure out my best strategy. Tell her, and be prepared to support whatever her plan is.", "NTA.  I hate surprise parties and the people I care about know that.  They know I would likely turn around and walk out of a surprise party if one was held for me (yes, it's an AH move, I don't care).  You'd kind of be an AH if you *didn't* tell her.\n\nIf it was me, I'd want to know and then decide whether or not I actually wanted to go to the party.  Her parents need a major reality check about actually doing what's best for her instead of what they think is best for her.", "NTA: tell her.\n\n\"Surprise\" parties are always asshole behavior. \n\n> Now, I'm conflicted on this because I know that my wife deserves a nice party and the spotlight\n\nSee, you're falling into the same trap; that a big party is *objectively* a good thing, but there's something weird about your wife, and you're being the bigger person by humoring that weirdness.\n\nShe *deserves* to be treated the way she wants.  You said that a big party is the exact opposite of what she wants.  So if you think she *deserves* a big party, that means you think she *deserves* to have her explicit desires completely overridden.  It means you think she *deserves* to be miserable so that everybody else can feel good about what nice people they are.  It means you think she *deserves* to not get what she wants.\n\nIs that all really what you think?\n\n> I'm thinking about at least letting her know it's coming without giving away any major details. \n\nNope, full disclosure.  Then ask your wife what she wants to do about it, and support her fully.\n\nThe golden rule is 'do unto others as you would have them do unto you.'  This is a terrible philosophy.  You'd like a big party, therefore you want to throw her a big party, even though you know she hates big parties.\n\nSo instead, follow the platinum rule: do unto others as they would have you do unto them.  Do what you know will make her happy, not what you think she 'deserves.'", "NTA. Love parties and hate surprises. I always react badly to surprises :( like Valentine\u2019s Day works out because my husband just tells me he\u2019s getting me chocolates or a stuffed animal.

A large part of why we aren't married is her utter despair at having to do something like that in front of people.

It would be her parents... for planning the surprise party in the first place.\n\nEven if you don't tell her, a conflict will still be there. And a confrontation may still happen between her and them. Possibly at the party itself.\n\nPlus, by not telling her in advance, you may be creating a conflict between you and her.

Even if it means her confronting her parents and refusing to attend the party.\n\nAnd do not worry if they get hurt, offended or embarrassed in the process. It may be what they need to experience to learn to back off a little.", ">They're great people, just always trying to do too much.\n\nGreat people wouldn't impose what they want to do on someone who's explicitly declined.", "You\u2019re absolutely right, which is why I\u2019m going against the grain here and not advocating the classic Reddit approach of \u201ccut the fuckers out of your life\u201d. So the question is which is it - it sounds like from your other comments that she can handle a party as long as it\u2019s not a surprise, so scenario 1 seems to be the better route here for family harmony. And if she wants to then fly off the handle to her parents\u2026 well that\u2019s her choice to make!", "> But I'm really trying to avoid any major conflict with my in-laws.\n\nWhy?  They're explicitly trying to upset your wife.  Why would you let this happen to 'avoid conflict?'", "\"Because she doesn't like surprise party's\"", "She doesn't like them and has said she doesn't want one. That's it, that's what you say to them.", "They aren't your parents, and both you and your wife are adults. You aren't a naughty child who needs an excuse!\n\nJust stand up and tell them \"Wife and I are a team, so of course I told her. I knew she wouldn't want the party you were insisting on as she'd already made her wishes very clear to all of us, and I respect that.\"", "\"Because she doesn't like them, you know she doesn't like them, and she deserved to know that you were, once again, planning to completely ignore her wants and do what you wanted anyway.\"", " No excuse needed, the truth will do fine.", "You don\u2019t need an excuse: \u201cShe\u2019s my wife, I adore her and her comfort will always be my number one priority over anyone else\u2019s hurt feelings\u201d.", "She definitely deserves to be celebrated privately and on her own terms. But forcing her into a public unwanted celebration is wrong. Making it easier would be telling her their plans and taking a day trip the day her parents try to ambush her. Her parents do not need advance notice of your plans, as they don\u2019t feel the need to give advance notice of their own.", "I don't see why her being an incredible person means she needs to have a party that she didn't want? They can force her to go, just tell her and let her decide if she wants it or not. If not she can call them and tell them not to bother.", "If she\u2019s as amazing as you say\u2026\n\nShe deserves the birthday she desires. She will obviously hate this surprise party. It will be uncomfortable at best. \n\nWithholding this information and then letting her walk into what will essentially be seen by her as an ambush, and forcing her to participate in an event she explicitly hates, is bad form. You\u2019re her partner. Don\u2019t let this happen. You need to speak up.", ">I'm just trying to make this easier because they 100% are not going to listen to me.\n\nI think the key thing here is to think about who you want to make it easier on? You made promises of loyalty to your wife when you married her, not her parents, so it should be your wife that you want to make it easier on. So tell your wife. Talk about how to deal with her parents disrespect together. Make plans to be elsewhere. Don't go to their party, even if it's in your house!", "Doing the exact opposite of what she wants isn't 'celebrating' her.  It's the exact opposite of celebrating her.  It's devaluing and dismissing her as a person.  It's telling her that she doesn't have agency.", "Good luck to you - I don\u2019t envy you. But your wife is very lucky to have a partner that has her back.", "> and that she can just pretend to be surprised.\n\nNo, that she can then choose not to go, because she doesn't want to, and it's not on her to pretend that she enjoys being told that she's not a person.", "To not like them? Sure. They can absolutely despise them, but hating goodwill gestures that much might be a sign of something else.", "Because it can be something that is related to anxiety. Always good to consult mental health professionals from time to time.", "I probably worded it poorly and obviously this wasn't a lot of detail but they don't do stuff like this all the time. The wedding was just the last one I could think of. Inherently great people, just not always the best at reading the room.", "Absolutely right. Haha I get why people jump to conclusions because one scenario isn't enough to really explain my 10 year relationship with them. I love them and want to do what's best for *all* of us. They've never done anything hurtful to us and have been incredibly supportive in-laws. Sometimes they just get too caught in the moment and try to do too much. I'd rather this than in-laws which are cruel people or non-existent in our lives.", "We're playing dumb. I texted her earlier and she's very happy to have been informed. We're going to pretend like nothing's up and I'm going to play along with the MIL", "Appreciate you.", "I don\u2019t think it necessarily is hating a goodwill gesture. A lot of people hate surprises and would rather be told. Op never said anything about her hating gestures in general , just surprises. So they could have planned a birthday party for her before they left but not made it a surprise party. It is her birthday so why shouldn\u2019t she get what she wants on her birthday ? In this case it means no surprise party. \n\nI\u2019m all for surprise parties but if someone hates surprises and you decide to surprise them anyways it makes you an asshole. The gesture is touching and sweet but you went out of your way to do something for them you knew 100% they wouldn\u2019t like.\n\nEdit:just realized he said she didn\u2019t want a big party either my bad. But she may just have some social anxiety. Nothing wrong with that.", "It can be, yeah.  But this is the only instance OP offers of it, so it's not debilitating or necessarily related to anxiety.  It's an unpleasant stimulus for many, related to \"fight or flight\".", "Never said there is anything wrong with social anxiety or disliking surprise parties. If the surprise is intended as a genuinely kind gesture and the recipient remains offended (hating vs disliking), there might be an issue worth addressing with a professional.", "I have surprise parties, too. I would think my husband knows that about me.\n\nI would be pissed at my husband if he knew a surprise party were happening and didn't tell me/stop the event.\n\nTo me, surprise parties are for the ones throwing the party.\n\nIf you're someone who likes surprise parties, then awesome. But if you're not, I would want my husband to have my back and ensure I didn't get something that would make me very uncomfortable.\n\nNTA Tell her", "If I were your wife and you didn\u2019t tell me. You would go on that trip alone. Like seriously she hates it, you know she does. And your putting your IL feeling above your wife", "Glad that you told her and she knows, but now you will have to navigate the territory of \u201csee? We told you she would love a surprise party!\u201d.  And your in-laws will likely double down on any boundaries or pushback in the future.", "NTA \n\nYour wife has boundaries. You respect them, and her parents don't. That's because you see her as an equal rather than lesser. You're the good person in this situation", "NTA - but you and wife really need to get spines - no one should be forcing you to do things you don\u2019t want to do.", "My daughter is like OP's wife. When she was going to turn 21, I surreptitiously got the phone number of one of her friends and texted her to let her know please no surprises and nothing big! She had a super fun and low key birthday that she thoroughly enjoyed instead of the surprise blowout that was in the works.\n\n6 years later she still thanks me.\n\nNTA OP and you're a good'n.", "NTA: I also hate surprises, but I've learned that I don't mind small surprises. So telling her may help her prepare for the party and be able to enjoy small surprises like who is there and what happens. And she can still be emotionally prepared and have the right clothes or whatever so she can feel her best.", "I hate surprises. My husband knows me well enough that he would tell me but also let my friends/family think they were surprising me. Respect your wife's wishes and boundaries above her family's.", "Based on your edit, sounds like you did the right thing!  It's nice to hear updates like this.  Sounds like you are a good partner who respects your wife's wishes, and I hope she enjoys the party.", "NAH.", "NTA. Also if her parents consistently cross her boundaries and put their own views above hers constantly they are not \u2018really good people\u2019.", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to put your foot down and make your in-laws deal with the consequences of their disrespect.\n\nTelling your wife is the way, so she can decide if she actually wants a party or if, oops, she's conveniently going out to dinner with a friend.", "You won't ruin her party if you tell her so she is prepared. As a person who would absolutely hate this too, I suggest you tell her. In that situation I would be overwhelmed, shut down and react poorly and offend everyone who planned it.", "I\u2019m so glad!  You did the right thing, I promise.", "She doesn't like them and has said she doesn't want one.", ">A large part of why we aren't married is her utter despair at having to do something like that in front of people.\n\nDon't let the bastards win; elope!\n\nBest of luck to you both.", "Happy Cake Day! \ud83c\udf70", "If they are continually doing things against your will they aren't great people.", "Thanks! We will one day, but for now we're pretty content."]}
