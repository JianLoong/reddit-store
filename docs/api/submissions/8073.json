The thing is, she hates surprises and hates being the center of attention. She hates it so much that she actually made us plan a vacation for her birthday so that no one would try to throw her a big party or surprise party. \n\nWell, as it turns out, her parents don't care and want to throw her a surprise party for a date before our vacation. They're extremely good people to us, but they are very bad about respecting our decisions on things. They're very pushy and tend to do things against our will as they think they're doing the right thing and making us happy. We basically had two weddings because they weren't happy that our first one was a smaller, backyard wedding (due to covid). My wife and I loved the small wedding and were completely happy with that being that. We told them we don't need a second one but they basically forced us to have one because they wanted family to come that couldn't go to the original. Long rant, but just explaining how they are sometimes. \n\nNow, I'm conflicted on this because I know that my wife *deserves* a nice party and the spotlight, but I know that she does not *want* to have those things. Would I be TA if I briefed her on what's going on? I'm thinking about at least letting her know it's coming without giving away any major details. As far as her parents are involved, I'll be doing everything in my power to make sure they don't turn it into a huge event as they always try to do. So far her mom has not listened to me, but I'll be diligent.\n\nEdit: Wifey has been informed of the party and was relieved to hear about it. She had a suspicion they would do it anyway, so we've just eliminated stress on her building up to her birthday week. I told her she's 100% in control of how much information she wants to know about it and if she wants out, I'll put my foot down. She actually seems into the idea now that it's not a surprise or anything huge. \n\nIn the meantime, I'll play along with the MIL and make sure things stay reasonable. Thanks for everyone's advice. I literally have never gone to reddit for advice before but this one I needed some honest feedback haha.", "created_utc": 1674486420, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jelv9/aita_if_i_tell_my_wife_about_a_surprise_party/", "score": 1365, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Having time to mentally prepare would be key for her and I'm sure she can put on a good show of being surprised.", "NTA.  You know she would hate to be surprised, so tell her.  But also, it sounds like your wife needs to do a better job of setting boundaries with her parents.", "NTA, and you definitely should do this, but in terms of HOW you tell her I'd suggest having a thought over which situation is going to cause least upset, because it all depends on the character of your wife:\n\nScenario 1: You tell your wife in secret from her parents, and suggest to her that she pretends to be surprised and delighted. This allows her to prepare herself mentally for the day, but also gives all the guests and her parents the thrill of surprising her. I'd go for this option if your wife doesn't like surprise parties because of the \"surprise\" element rather than the \"party\" element.\n\nScenario 2: You tell your wife's parents that under no circumstances should this go ahead, and that you will tell your wife yourself on X date if they haven't put the brakes on the whole plan by then. I'd go for this route only if the \"party\" aspect is the thing that would stress her out, because this way will of course cause more friction between yourself and your parents in law, which I'm assuming your wife would not want.", "NTA. Your loyalty should always be to your wife. 100%. She should know you have her back no matter what. Your in-laws \u201cwould do anything\u201d for you guys, except respect your wishes.

Please tell your wife. I would hate to have a surprise party thrown for me and if my husband knew about it and didn't at least give me the heads-up I'd be pissed.", "YWNBTA. And please, please have a sit down with your in-laws about boundaries. Your in-laws wanting to go above and beyond for you sounds great in theory, but these things build up and add strain when they aren\u2019t addressed.", "NTA. Tell her. She has a very simple, very understable boundary and her parents are refusing to follow it. Tell your wife what they're planning and tell them to knock it off.

But you should also just tell her parents that your telling her and tell them why your telling her. It sounds like she would hate it so her parents have no right to force that on her. It sounds like her parents are throwing this party to please themselves rather than to please her.", "NTA.  This is a pattern of behaviour that doubtless causes your wife great pain and has done her entire life.  There's nothing good or kind about the in-laws' intentions and they don't deserve to be honoured.", "Deserves? How does your wife deserve this level of mistreatment? How exactly is going against her wishes helpful for her? No, what she deserves is a spouse who will stand up for her and with her, someone who will put their foot down and say no to manipulation. Her parents can\u2019t make you do anything. Why do her parents opinions matter more to you than your own wife? You should definitely tell your wife, so the two of you can make plans together to avoid this ambush.", "NTA but it sounds like your in-laws need a lesson in \u201cit\u2019s not about them.\u201d I still wouldn\u2019t tell her about the party, but do your best to get them to drop the surprise portion - you likely know your wife better than they do at this point. If you KNOW it is going to cause major anxiety, you may need to drop some very big hints to your wife.", "NTA to brief her.  But it\u2019s her side of the family so she is in charge of the confrontation", "NTA. Not one bit. You know she won't like it, so you're preparing her. It's the nice thing to do.", "NTA. You know your wife hates these things and you\u2019re coming from a good place in wanting to tell her.", "NTA\nI HATE surprises. Hate hate hate. I have a nog birthday coming up soon and if my partner knew somebody was planning a party for me and didn't tell me. I would be MAD at him! My in-laws sang at me one year, in a restaurant, for my birthday. I don't go out with them any time near my birthday now. It's embarrassing and awkward and ridiculous to force an adult to be the centre of attention when they don't want it. Save her, please.", "NTA, but if you're right and she says she doesn't want it, you two need to make sure they know you aren't coming. They can't force you to participate, you just always give in after they apply enough pressure. They will keep applying more and more pressure until they find the point where you give in. Extinction bursts suck, but they are necessary to get to the other side.", "YWNBTA. You have effectively been put in the position where you need to pick loyalties. Are you more loyal to your In-Laws (stated) wish for secrecy, or your Wife's (assumed) wish to not have surprise parties? I guess your first loyalty has to be to your wife. \n\nHowever, be aware that your in-laws will definitely consider you to be an a-hole if you tell her, no matter how justified you feel. You can reduce this, perhaps, by at least informing the in-laws that you intend to tell your wife. But you are unlikely to get any thanks from them. \n\nAlso, do some soul searching to check how sure you are that this would be your wife's wish - you would, after all, be spoiling the surprise. Maybe do an honesty check with yourself to confirm that it is not just that YOU would hate this to happen to YOU.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't know if your wife has it to that extent but you make it pretty apparent that something like this has far more downsides than upsides by not telling your wife.\n\nThe worst that can happen is that you 'ruin' the surprise if you tell her. The worst that can happen if you don't tell her is that she is upset you hid it from her and it ruins your vacation or creates conflict between the two of you.", "NTA. Tell your wife, and make plans for yourselves for that day. Don't let her parents keep persuading you into stuff that neither of you want to do. \n\nAnd tell her parents that your wife has expressed her wishes perfectly clearly - she does not want a party and will not be attending a party. As such, you will be giving her the celebration she wants, and not spoiling it for her by disrespecting her wishes.", "NTA please tell her. I'm like your wife in that a surprise party in my honour is my idea of hell. If I found out that my partner knew ahead of time and didn't give me any warning I would be very hurt and upset.", "NTA. I also hate surprise parties and I would absolutely want to be told. As you said, start just with that it's happening and then she can decide how many details she wants or if she wants to talk to her parents about it.", "NTA, you already know she hates surprises like this. Her parents should know it too but decide to do one anyway, so they're doing the surprise party for themselves not for your wife.", "NTA, but you need to do more than tell her. Her parents refuse to respect your boundaries. As good as they are to you, the more you let them ride roughshod over you, the harder it will be to set boundaries for really important things, like if you have children. Suggest couples therapy to your wife so you can develop ways to kindly but firmly set and hold boundaries with them together.", "NTA. It seems that your intentions of informing her are due to your support, respect and loyalty to your wife, the subject of the party, because you actually listen to your wife and value her voice. I think your wife will be nothing less than appreciative of you informing her of her family's disregarding her long standing desire to avoid surprises.\n\nMy partner's family is filled with kind people who mean well but are completely clueless to their semi consistent resistance to our wishes for everything WE choose as a unified front. We are constantly put in situations we don't want to be in, despite active efforts to avoid predictable bs. This is why we are both very careful about what we share with who and never agree to anything without consulting each other. Your wedding reality was my concern which is exactly why nobody knows we are married. \n\nI say tell her. It'll only strengthen her trust in you to protect her from the willful ignorance of her family.", "How are you, as adults, letting your parents bully you into an unwanted birthday party and a whole ass second wedding? YTA for not being able to set and enforce limits.", "NTA, but you need to tell your wife everything asap. This is not an acceptable way for her parents to behave toward their adult married daughter. If you two do not come together with a plan to end this manipulative boundary stomping just think of how bad it will get when children come into the picture. Seriously by consistently giving in you're consenting to and enabling their inappropriate behavior in your life. That is not minimizing damages it is lacking the tools necessary to communicate that no is a complete answer.  These people are narcissists, they aren't doing these things for you, they are doing them to you. One because they enjoy being the actual center of attention and two because being in control makes them feel good, and if it makes you uncomfortable that makes it even better for them.", "NTA.\n\nI'm a lot like your wife, and I'd be *beyond* pissed if I knew my husband saw this coming and didn't at least tell me so I could prepare for it. \n\nGiving her a heads up will at least allow her to prepare herself for it. She can wear something she likes if that's important to her, do her hair or whatever makes her feel good, take the time to rest as much as she needs to beforehand and plan downtime after, etc. \n\nAnd definitely keep working on her parents, unless she decides this is it and she's blowing up the whole thing and finally tell them she's done showing up to shit she doesn't want to go to.\n\nMy MIL loved throwing surprise parties. I haaaaate being surprised. I told her if she threw me a surprise bridal shower I'd leave. She asked my now-husband if I was serious and he was like \"idk, mom, but do you really want to find out the embarrassing way?\" \n\nI did not have any surprise showers, or any other surprise parties.", "NTA from someone just like your wife in this regard.\n\nI think you've measured it right, heads up but no details unless she asks.\n\nIf she doesn't want to have the party, you could always fall back on it being the *day before your vacation* as an additional reason not to go as they're not respecting her boundaries.\n\n*\"Sorry! Couldn't stop the wife from getting me involved in all these chores. We're all sweaty and dirty now and it'll be suspicious if I try and get her showered and ready, plus we'll be late. What?

I hate surprises as well and would appreciate the heads up. You don't have to give a ton of details but she will probably appreciate a little warning to get herself mentally prepared. \n\nMy BFF knows how much I hate surprises and has taken the time to give me a very low-detail heads up about 2 surprise birthday events some other friends planned for me. All she told me is that there would be a surprise and when; I got to be surprised by the actual event but I was mentally prepared and dressed correctly for the occasion.", "NTA. \n\nYour wife sounds just like me! I would not be happy if my DH knew about this and didn\u2019t give me a heads up so I could figure out my best strategy. Tell her, and be prepared to support whatever her plan is.", "NTA.  I hate surprise parties and the people I care about know that.  They know I would likely turn around and walk out of a surprise party if one was held for me (yes, it's an AH move, I don't care).  You'd kind of be an AH if you *didn't* tell her.\n\nIf it was me, I'd want to know and then decide whether or not I actually wanted to go to the party.  Her parents need a major reality check about actually doing what's best for her instead of what they think is best for her.", "NTA: tell her.\n\n\"Surprise\" parties are always asshole behavior. \n\n> Now, I'm conflicted on this because I know that my wife deserves a nice party and the spotlight\n\nSee, you're falling into the same trap; that a big party is *objectively* a good thing, but there's something weird about your wife, and you're being the bigger person by humoring that weirdness.\n\nShe *deserves* to be treated the way she wants.  You said that a big party is the exact opposite of what she wants.  So if you think she *deserves* a big party, that means you think she *deserves* to have her explicit desires completely overridden.  It means you think she *deserves* to be miserable so that everybody else can feel good about what nice people they are.  It means you think she *deserves* to not get what she wants.\n\nIs that all really what you think?\n\n> I'm thinking about at least letting her know it's coming without giving away any major details. \n\nNope, full disclosure.  Then ask your wife what she wants to do about it, and support her fully.\n\nThe golden rule is 'do unto others as you would have them do unto you.'  This is a terrible philosophy.  You'd like a big party, therefore you want to throw her a big party, even though you know she hates big parties.\n\nSo instead, follow the platinum rule: do unto others as they would have you do unto them.  Do what you know will make her happy, not what you think she 'deserves.'", "NTA. Love parties and hate surprises. I always react badly to surprises :( like Valentine\u2019s Day works out because my husband just tells me he\u2019s getting me chocolates or a stuffed animal.

It would be her parents... for planning the surprise party in the first place.\n\nEven if you don't tell her, a conflict will still be there. And a confrontation may still happen between her and them. Possibly at the party itself.\n\nPlus, by not telling her in advance, you may be creating a conflict between you and her.
