I don't have a very good relationship with their parents, my sister and brother in law. This was especially exacerbated this past summer when I got married, my sister was my maid of honor and was an absolute nightmare to deal with. She's just very rude and cold; she works at a nursing home and her work mug  says \"Sarcastic Bitch\". \n\nAnyway every year I spend about $500 on my niece & nephew between birthday and Christmas gifts. And every year my niece, who is a darling, says thank you and enjoys what she gets. My nephew however is a nightmare kid. He's been kicked out of several sports for injuring other kids. He has no empathy or compassion and will sometimes hurt his little sister when he thinks nobody is looking. He has thrown gifts on the floor - gifts that he specifically asked for - because he didn't have his gaming system there with him at that moment so what good was a new game. This Christmas, I asked my sister what to get him and she told me a GameStop gift card. So I got him $100 gift card. And when he opened it he said \"I hate when you think you're getting this great gift and its just a gift card\". Obviously no thank you, he didn't even look at me. And my sister & BIL did nothing. Well my brother in law teased my nephew, \"Wow that's a nice thing to say. You're just mad because you can't go to the store RIGHT NOW to spend it\". But they didn't say anything to me. No thanks on his behalf, nothing. \n\nI'm just honestly fed up and with inflation & food costs & gas etc, I can't afford to keep spending on these kids like I have so I plan to cut back anyway. But I'm honestly sick of spending anything on them at all. I don't really blame my nephew for being this way because that's how he's being raised...but I also don't think I need to shell out money to have gifts literally tossed on the floor. My niece isn't doing anything wrong though so I don't know if she should be punished too \"out of fairness\". \n\nTLDR; WIBTA if I stopped buying gifts for my nephew only?", "created_utc": 1673629850, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10azr1l/wibta_if_i_stopped_buying_my_nephew_gifts_because/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Make it optional. Your little jerk nephew won't opt in but your niece will so you will still be able to maintain a positive interaction with her and not have to waste time/money in someone who won't appreciate it.", "NTA, no one is entitled to gifts, but you must be aware of the possible consequences of your choice, if you keep buying gifts just for niece: your sister and her husband will surely have something to say. Like, that you're being unfair and mean to their innocent little angel.\n\nAlso, from what you tell, there is a possibility that nephew gets nuclear towards his sister out of envy and jealousy.\n\nHow about you put that money aside for an education fund for niece?", "NTA - I'm most worried about what happens to the niece if the nephew turns his resentment on her. You ultimately can't control how they parent their kids, but in my experience you should try and sneak your niece a gift card or cash; kids love keeping secrets like that.", "\"\"when he opened it he said \"I hate when you think you're getting this great gift and its just a gift card\".\"\"\n\nWow!!    I'd stop buying g presents.", "NTA. Don't make a big deal out of it, but just stop bringing him gifts. If he or anyone else asks, just politely say that you were insulted for your last gift and you didn't want to repeat the experience. The key thing here is that you do NOT want to try to make this a \"learning experience\" for him; you just don't want to be insulted again or waste money on an ungrateful recipient.", "YWNBTA\nBut the fact that your nephew intentionally hurts his sister may escalate when he sees her getting gifts and he doesn't. He may take it out on her.\nThis is a tricky situation as the parents don't see anything wrong with his behaviour and clearly he has no discipline. \n\nBut overall it's your choice how you handle it going forward", "NTA: why would you keep giving someone gifts who acts so disrespected when they receive the gift?", "NTA\n\nMoney obviously is an issue, so you can cut back on gifts in general. But teaching your nephew his behavior has consequences is important. \n\nYour niece shows appreciation, so she gets gifts. Your nephew is rude about it, so no gifts. The lesson is not to feel entitled and that how you treat people matters. No one will want to give to a bratty and ungrateful person. If he never cares for what he gets, then he shouldn't be upset anyways.\n\nI would make sure the reason is known, though. Maybe say it prior that you will no longer waste money on gifts that are not appreciated.", "NTA.  Buying gifts for anyone is a voluntary action.", "NTA.\n\nYour nephew is a menace. It's his parents responsibility to discipline him. And in regards to giving gifts to your niece? It's up to the parents to explain that to him.", "Nta. Maybe consider experience gifts for your niece for the future so the nephew can't break or ruin what you give her when he gets nothing since he wants to act a fool when he gets a nice $100 giftcard. Also consider donating to charities in his name since he can't be grateful for the things he did get. Toys for tots might be a nice fit. A grateful child would get something.", "NTA\n\nHe's old enough to know actions have consequences. His parents ESPECIALLY are old enough to know that. Don't do anything flashy, just quietly stop getting him things. You aren't obligated to get him anything.\n\nBased on his behavior, though, I have a feeling gifts you get your niece will end up mysteriously destroyed or missing. I suggest either getting her gifts that she can use when with/visiting you or do things like a girls day at the park, movies, spa, etc.", "NTA - sounds like your gifts are a burden to him. No reason to burden him any more.", "NTA. Being family is not an excuse to be disrespectful. You also should not have to ignore your own boundaries for family. Consider if all involved were friends - how would you handle it? \n\nI'm in a similar situation to you. My sister has called me a bad aunt/sister over it. I wouldn't tolerate the behaviors from anyone else in my life, so why should I tolerate it from her/my nephew?", "I am concerned for the little sister receiving gifts when the brother receives nothing.

I feel about the reaction your Nieves would have to endure. Consider putting some $$ aside for when she\u2019s older. She may an escape route at 18 and that money could get her out", "NTA. I'd tell him why too. Tell him you don't want him to be disappointed anymore so you've decided to not contribute to it.", "NTA, he doesn't deserve a gift. But I think you should maybe get him a crappy gift instead of nothing. If you get him nothing there's a good chance he takes it out on his sister.", "NTA but there will be fallout. The unempathetic Dahmer-in-the-making will bully his sister more, potentially seriously harming her, and your sister will blow up about your gifting strategy.\n\nI'd reduce what you spend on them and put it in a fund. Hers she can spend on college, his will probably be needed for therapy.", "This one is hard.\n\nNTA for only punishing the kid that is not grateful.\n\nBut think about the possible backlash: angry resentful nephew, angry frustrated parents,...\n\nI'd want to teach the brat a lesson too but it may not be worth a big family conflict...", "NTA, gifts are always optional.\n\nI feel a little bad for your niece; you might continue giving her just birthday gifts - at least on that occasion there's no reason for your nephew to expect anything.  Christmas it might be awkward getting something for her but not him.", "NTA\n\nHe's spoilt and ungrateful and people like that doesn't deserve gifts. If he deliberately injures people and has no empathy however then that could be something pretty serious which won't get better with time.", "Nta. I would\u2019ve took the gc back he wouldn\u2019t be enjoying anything from me", "YWNBTA. If he asks why you didn't get him anything just tell him he didn't like any of the other things you got him so you're just saving him the trouble of being ungrateful.", "You WNBTA in my book, but be prepared for a conflict with your sister, who will definitely think that you are the AH for doing this.", "He\u2019s 12.  Why not just talk to him and ask why he acts that way when receiving gifts.  Tell him you intend to stop giving him things if he is going to act that way.  It sounds like he needs someone to invest the time in him and point him in the right direction.", "Can you flip your spending to 80/20 girl/boy?", "YWNBTA sounds like you have a healthy balanced perspective.

Invest the money into a college savings account or an account for when they turn 18+. \n\n\nI'd sit down with the nephew and tell him he's old enough to know the difference between right/wrong and even though his parents failed to raise him right, you're not going to join in to help raise him to be an entitled AH.

But like others have mentioned, kid would probably make his sister's life miserable the moment he detects she's being favored in any capacity over him. I think you would need to stop giving both of them gifts, because the demon kid would probably destroy whatever you gave your niece and that's still your money going to the trash.\n\nA girl's day out with your niece might be a better option. Can't destroy the experience, and you get to still have a positive relationship with her (and likely less expensive to take her out to a movie or something.)", "I don't see a need to financially reward the niece for being the 'better' kid.\n\nI would back up and spend less on both of them so you're not so upset when nephew acts bratty.

Get him books on manners or gratitude or something.", "YWNBTA, but gifts are gifts, not meant to be deserved or earned. Your nephew is lacking appropriate guidance. A heart-to-heart with your sister, who apparently can dish it so should be able to take it, might go a ways towards arriving at something reasonable. At least if she doesn't agree you'll have done your part by expressing your feelings and your request for basic courtesy, before deciding whether or not to just stop giving your nephew anything. \n\nAnd good for you for realizing that you don't have to spend so much on your niece and nephew.", "I\u2019m going with YWBTA, they\u2019re children and not your job to discipline them or teach them lessons, and also it doesn\u2019t sit right with me adults being vindication to children, no matter how much they deserve it. You could spend significantly less on your nephews gifts, if he\u2019s not going to like it regardless, just spend less, not obviously so. Or you stop buying for both and explain cost of living is biting and you need to save a bit more money.", "YTA. You are dealing with a child who is probably dealing with multiple issues, including what could be lousy parents. You are writing him off at a young age. Giving people gifts is one of the simplest ways to show some love and care. By focusing on his sister at this age you are making this about you and how you like to be treated, it's not about the kids or being a good aunt/uncle. If we were talking mid-teens or older this would be a different answer. \n\nInflation sucks, I get the monetary argument. So make gift-giving affordable for both of them. And try to be a positive influence in his life, it may seem futile but hopefully you can be the person to help drag him out of this misery.", "YWBTA since this is a child. \n\n It sounds like no one is even telling him that his behavior is unkind. Because he is a child with little life experience, he *should* be told how rude it is. How else is a kid going to know otherwise. So this brings me to the next question\u2014\n\nWould he even know the reason why you\u2019ve stopped caring about him but not his sister? Since his current behavior is all peaches and cream, how is he to know how you feel? All he would know is uncle/aunt OP doesn\u2019t like me", "As someone who has had nieces and nephews from a young age, soft YWBTA. Mainly because of your nephews age. Yeah, he sounds like he really sucks and he definitely doesn't deserve your gifts. But he is a kid and you are an adult and he will always remember how you treated him. the kid's gifts should be fair. Maybe take your niece out for outings or fun activities more often instead. Hopefully he gets his act together eventually, but if you've distanced yourself from him now, you can't really get that back later", "YWBTAH they\u2019re kids. You need to have a firm talk with the parents before you go nuclear and play obvious favorites. I get the kids an asshole but 2 assholes don\u2019t make a right.", "You're mad at a 12 year old for not having raised himself better?  That seems fair.   He should have done a better job of making sure he wasn't a little asshole. \n\n\nAlso, what is it like to have conditional love?  I've never been able to do that so I'm genuinely interested.", "YTA not because you have to give gifts. I am a firm believer in not being forced to give gifts. However, I am against this as I am worried about your niece who Will be put facing some hate", "YTA (yes you would be)\n\nhe's 12 and sounds like he has some behavioural challenges for whatever reason, I am female and was terrible as a child in large part due to being (undiagnosed) autistic. If you cannot afford to spend money on them, lower your budget for both but stay well clear of favouritism as it will also create a wedge between them as siblings. And it sets a tuly terrible example and is just very unfair. I am not sure why you are spending so much... \n\nWe give (if we give truly) without expectation - if you cannot give without needing things back yourself, then don't do it .... If you are expecting perfect behaviour from children, then that's unrealistic. They're kids and often boys do struggle with getting into teens - not for nothing do we call it the \"grunting-phase\".", "YWBTA. \n\nFavoritism.", "I've been crucified in the past for saying YTA on posts like this but I think it still applies.\n\nAt their ages, they're really impressionable. Getting a gift for one but not the other becomes a source of resentment down the road and exacerbates the behavior. Unfortunately, I think you still have to try to be fair with gift-giving. The sad thing is that your relationship with their parents isn't good enough to talk to them about him. Your relationship with your nephew is also not good enough to try to correct him either.\n\nI'd recommend just lowering the gift dollar amount for both, but taking your niece out for fun excursions/activities or something too. You want to reward her and help her stay the path she's on, plus getting her away from that house will help stop her from being hurt by her brother. It may also give their parents more one on one time with your nephew, which could help straighten him out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I can't believe the amount of people trying to excuse his behavior because \"he's a child.\" He's going to be a teenager in a YEAR. He will be an adult in just a few short years. He should have been taught at a younger age to be appreciative for the things people choose to give him. My 12 year old would never act like that. My 6 year old tried throwing a fit about a gift from his uncle this year and got instantly shut down and was made to apologize and act graciously. That's the age you teach that. Not when your kid is over half-grown. \n\nHe will absolutely understand why you are giving gifts to his sister and not him, but he will NOT like it. Why do people act like children are completely oblivious? They are completely capable of understanding the consequences of their behavior as long as their parents aren't going behind them undoing all of the consequences.

I'll go with NTA though.\n\nYou aren't obligated to give gifts, and if you do, you should give with no expectations or strings attached. OTOH, it's hardly outrageous to expect at least a \"thanks\" from a recipient, and your nephew is definitely old enough to know that. So I feel like no, you're not the AH if you opt not to give him presents. \n\nBut... I keep coming back to the fact that he's a child and his parents have failed him on this front. I know it's asking a lot but I feel like you should keep channels open because this child may need you some day. He may not realize it right now, or even in the near future, but I can imagine a point where things get bad for him and he may think, \"Aunt X has always been nice to me, maybe she'll help now.\"\n\nMaybe not. Maybe he'll always be a total AH and that will probably lead to a lonely life.\n\nOn the other other hand, it is your money and you get to decide how to spend it. Your nephew needs to realize, as he surely will at some point, that this kind of behavior will not stand with a lot of people and there will be consequences. Maybe he's better off learning that now.\n\nI do fear, as other posters have said, that if you show obvious favoritism, your niece will suffer since apparently she already does under normal circumstances. \n\nI like the idea of doing something for both kids, and then finding ways to do more for your niece. She needs help and support as well, and I'm glad you can afford to do it, financially and emotionally.\n\nGood luck.", "I find that I naturally spend more subconsciously on children that \u201clight up\u201d when they receive a gift.

This is specifically a situation where OP is asking if they should keep buying gifts for someone who is ungrateful for them.", "I did say \"I don't really blame my nephew for being this way because that's how he's being raised\". I never said I was going to treat him poorly or stop loving him. TBH my dude it sounds like there might be some personal stuff here and I truly wish peace & love for you.", "> You\u2019re mad at a 12 year old for not having raised himself better?\n\nI guess we just skipped over OP saying they don\u2019t blame the kid, but the parents. Reading is hard.\n\n\nTIL not buying gifts for someone means you don\u2019t love them.", "*Dude.*", "Strongly disagree. I was an undiagnosed autistic child and I didn't insult gifts that were given to me. It's not unreasonable (nor is it favoritism) to stop giving gifts to someone when the response to every gift is *insults and violence*.", "Did yu read? Lol it\u2019s not favoritism that kid is bad ash & he\u2019s ungrateful what type of kids y\u2019all raising?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

And if he doesn't want to then nothing is lost. ~~Idk where you got that the mother specifically is causing this behavior?~~ But I agree that spending time with adults other than just their parents is really healthy for kids.\n\nEdit - nevermind duh you got the mom being the problem from the entire first paragraph that I immediately forgot about lol my bad! Probably is getting it from mom :/", "How about you put that money aside for an education fund for niece?", "That's okay OP just has to do one-on-one. Kids are often better behaved in an individual setting and there is no need to cave every time to their every whim - OP has the ability to say no. And if nephew has a bad time because he doesn't get what he wants, then he won't want to do these experiences again so win for OP \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yes, it was my fear as well.\n\nHonestly I think the best way is to be direct. Give niece nicz gifts. And give nephew gifts that are not expansive, like 15$ worth.\n\nIf him of parents complain, simply tell the truth : that the last times he was completely ungrateful and he does not deserve nice gifts as long as he behaves that way.\n\nHonestly with how detached the parents seem , I don't think they would even make that much a fuss about it.", "Could you perhaps buy gifts at a similar, smaller level for both of them, but then save the extra in an account for your niece for when she's older?\n\nBy the time she's 18 she'll probably be aware of how wrong her brother's behaviour is, and you can always trickle the money out by helping her with college expenses or buying her bits when she moves into an apartment etc, so her parents aren't suspicious about where all this money has suddenly come from?", "Take the fact that he told you to buy him \"nothing\" as the gift that it is, and stop buying him presents. Good luck.", "You're going to make sure he feels excluded because this will eventually play out in front of a bunch of people, and I'm the one with some issues?  If you think that isn't treating someone poorly then maybe you should spend some time learning about peace and love rather than wishing me peace and love.", "ok... they don't blame the kid, but want to punish them anyways, that makes much more sense... OP can say they don't blame the kid all they want... I can say I'm a walking talking dachshund, but that doesn't make it so. \n\n>TIL not buying gifts for someone means you don\u2019t love them.\n\nif you go out of your way to make a show of excluding a kid, yeah, you don't love them... and you're a shitty person.", "I just really struggled with emotions and expressing them for a variety of reason and was rebellious and at times ill behaved - all I am saying is for some children growing up is very hard, and with that can come behavioural issues so instead of judging (and writing off!) what is still a young child only 12!! - the OP does not know everything that's going on in his life and she's the adult here and in my book if you are in the life of children you need to set good examples and not create wedges - and it is clear favouritism.", "You're giving gifts to someone else cause the way their sibling is acting is not gonna solve the problem. It will literally cause more issues and strife between the siblings. If the said Relative has that much of a problem then they should go tell the parent and have the parent handle it and keep it a stack.", "Yeah, wasn't insinuating, but from what OP said about the mom, that's likely where he learned it. Boys generally bond more with their mothers and girls with their fathers. Curious if the dad is a respectful and well rounded guy and that's why the niece is as she is. \n\nBut, he is clearly going through something, and needs to be guided differently. A Role model that can show how you're supposed to act.", "So you should keep rewarding someone who obviously isn\u2019t grateful and spending their own money on them because they were raised badly? At the end of the day he\u2019s old enough to know right from wrong and is old enough for the consequences of his own actions.\n\nHow are they making a show out of it? OP is simply going to stop getting him gifts, no one is entitled to a gift. They\u2019re asking if they would be TA to not also punish their niece for something she didn\u2019t do.", "It\u2019s not \u201cfavoritism\u201d. It\u2019s refusing to reward bad behavior.", "12 year olds are old enough to know hurting people on purpose is not okay. The kid has serious issues and needs help but parents don\u2019t care.

She said would she be ta is she keep gifting to her niece but not her nephew. It would be unfair if she stop gifting her niece bc her brother cannot control his emotions", "Agree.  That girl is in for a world of hurt from the brother when he takes out his anger on her.  While I do not think the nephew deserves a gift or reward of any sort, the only way to do this is give neither a x-mad present and then find a way to get the niece something secretly.", "Yeah that was my bad 100% of the way I spaced out on the bit about the mom when I came back and was like where was that?? \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f lol\n\nYes you make great points. And even if you're a good role model, kids will default to certain behavioral patterns when mom and dad are around that they can break away from more easily when apart from them and just with someone like OP", "This. She's not showing favoritism to one child over the other; she's simply choosing not to waste money on a child who is insulting her and her gifts. This is a natural consequence that the boy needs to learn: if you insult people's gifts, the gifts stop coming.\n\nETA: I feel like you may be bringing some emotional baggage to this? She's not \"judging\" or \"writing off\" this child. She's simply...not giving him a $100 gift card for him to insult. If that's \"judgment\" then I've been judged every day of my entire life.
