When I was I graduated from college I ended up leaving my home state and moving to Arizona with my husband (35). Me and my sister barely talked after that because I was busy with my career and my marriage. Now, I have a 6 year old daughter and I'm currently pregnant with twins (both genders) \n\nOn Wednesday, I received a long text message from my sister and she told me she was getting married and she wanted me to walk her down the isle. I was happy for her until she told me the date of her wedding. Her wedding is November 22nd and I would've gave birth to my twins on November 12th. I have no interest in traveling that soon after I gave birth and I definitely have no interest leaving my husband with three kids. I wanna get use to being a family of 5 together just like how we got use to being a family of 3 together. I told my sister that I couldn't attend because that i would only be a week or two postpartum and I didn't feel like flying across the country that soon. \n\nShe tried asking if my husband would watch the kids but I straight up told her that I'm not leaving my kids that are that young across the country and they are too young to fly on a plane. She ended up getting pissed with me and told me that she wanted to catch up with me and she hasn't seen me in years so I replied with that we would need to catch up on another day. She ended up hanging up the phone and now since our conversation I've been getting emails from her bridesmaids that I was intentionally trying to hurt my sister?

And I would point out to your sister that you are saying \u201cno\u201d as much for her benefit as yours.  Having twins can be high risk.  There is a greater than average chance that you or the babies could have complications. (I don\u2019t mean to sound scary or pessimistic but your sister should think about this.)  what if you agreed to go then had to bail at the last minute because the twins are still in the neonatal unit at the hospital? Or you have a difficult delivery and are still on bed rest on the doctors orders.  All sorts of issues surrounding you and the twins could have caused you to cancel at the last minute.

Of course you're not going to go and be in her wedding then! You're not going to do anything except stay home with your babies.

And if there are complications or surgery involved?\n\nIt would be pushing things to hope that you might be able to attend a local wedding so soon after the birth of your children and sit at the back. Getting on a plane so soon after giving birth? Being in a wedding? This is an absurd idea. Your sister is ridiculous.\n\nAnd here's why she's especially ridiculous. She wants you to walk her down the aisle. That's nice, and I'm sure you'd like to do that in normal circumstances. But before you pick a date for a wedding, you have to check that all the essential people are available on that date. That's exactly what we did, and what every sensible person does, when arranging a wedding date. We called my parents, and her parents, and said \"we're looking at a Saturday some time between June and October - are there any dates you can't make.\" And one person had some important commitment for one weekend, so we excluded that weekend as a possibility.  And then we talked to the church, and the venue we wanted for a reception, and ended up with a small number of viable candidate dates.\n\nWhat your sister needed to do was call you before she sets the date, and have that conversation. At this point, you would tell her that your twins are due in November, so you're not going to be able to fly anywhere after let's say September 1st, and you're not going to be realistically able to fly and be in a wedding until March 1st at the earliest. \n\nI don't think your sister has any idea of how recovery from childbirth works, and I don't think she has any idea how much work caring for twin babies is.", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019ll be physically recovering from birth and adjusting to life with brand new twins, it is what it is.", "NTA - going from one child to two is hard. Going from one to three is going to take some serious time to adjust to. \n\nYour sister poorly planned for this with that date and now wants to blame you.\n\nEnjoy your babies!", "NTA\n\nThat soon after giving birth, you will not be healed from the delivery.  Doubly so if you have a C-section.  In many cultures, you'd still be \"lying in,\" staying at home, mostly in bed or in other comfortable places, resting, letting your body heal without the strain of doing work or exercise, and being cared for by relatives.  \n\n Tell her you will discuss it with your doctor.  \n\nSend a message like this \"***Thinking about it, I would really like to be at your wedding and reconnect.  But I'm not sure if I will be well enough to travel.  I will discuss this with my doctor at my next appointment, to see if I can safely be there.  Hopefully it will work out, but I don't want to take chances, or risk having a health crisis at your ceremony and disrupting it.\"***\n\nThe doctor will tell you \"no.\"  Then tell her your doctor has told you \"no\" and that you hope the two of you can reconnect after you've recovered.\n\nDo not make this about what you \"want\" to do, or about whether or not you're comfortable leaving the babies so soon.  That makes it personal, you don't want to go to her wedding, you don't want to see her.  \n\nThe doctor's orders are not a personal slight to her, or a refusal by you to attend her wedding.

It can be a grueling time.", "ESH because it sounds like you weren't gentle with delivery.

The 12th as a due date is not always spot on. You could have complications having twins and have a c-section. That is too close to giving birth to be obligating yourself to anything on that scale.

OP might give birth mere days before the wedding, or might have a c-section that takes a minimum of 4-6 weeks to heal from before anything strenuous & travel is strenuous.\n\nIf sister felt it was so important to have OP for the wedding, she should have called and cleared the date first before locking a date down.\n\nNTA\n\nBest wishes for the twins!", "Or she could just tell her sister to fuck off. She has her kids to think about.", "She knew that I was pregnant but not the due date as we aren't close anymore.", "I was gentle when I told her no the first time.

Did you tell her about the pregnancy yourself, or did she hear about it through the grapevine?", "Well, I don't feel like being on a flight for hours away from my family.", "Sure op Could have said can\u2019t but well that would be a lie? \n\nTechnically she Can go. \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t, and she will clearly feel wrong about it if she went.\n\nShe was being honest, and her sister Should have been understanding about it instead of taking it like a personal insult.", "How is op the guilty one?? She told her the due date and sister still insisted op should get on a plane a few days after giving birth.", "Yes, I told her about the pregnancy.", "Why didn\u2019t you also tell her the due date?\n\nI will be candid about my gut sense here because I don\u2019t want you to feel like I\u2019m trying to trick you into something.  My impression is that you may still be carrying a lot of resentment about your role as third parent to your sister growing up, and that the way so you thoroughly distanced yourself from her as an adult may be your way of acting out your anger, even though it should be directed toward your parents instead of her because your sister had no choice in the matter at the time, and was not the one who made you take on that role.\n\nThat she wants you to walk her down the aisle tells me that your relationship still has deep meaning to her, and she probably still wants to be close to you.  Asking you to walk her down the aisle is a recognition of everything you did for her growing up, and of how much she values and appreciates it.  It\u2019s completely reasonable that you can\u2019t fly that soon after giving birth, but I suspect your sister is also hurting deeply about the idea of you not being beside her during the wedding, and by having her invitation so bluntly rejected as something you had \u201cno interest\u201d in. \n\nI don\u2019t think you withheld your due date in order to mess with her wedding plans, I think that\u2019s just a really unfortunate coincidence.  But it seems odd to me that your due date never came up when you told her about your pregnancy, and I can\u2019t help but wonder if your withheld it as a way of continuing to keep her at arms length.", "All of your assumptions are incorrect. I had told her about my pregnancy way before I knew about the due date and we haven't talk as much since that conversation so that's why she doesn't know about it.\n\nI've been trying to focus on my family in welcoming two additions to the family so people outside of my husband and my 6-year-old hasn't been my priority.\n\nNo, I don't hold resentment towards my sister and I shouldn't have to be attached to her hip to show that I'm not bitter about what happened \ud83e\udd23.\n\nI never said I had no interest in her wedding. I said I had no interest in flying across the country TO her wedding. \n\nFamily grows apart and we aren't as close as we were and that's okay. She's gonna start her own family soon and she won't have time as well.", "This is exactly how I feel you worded it very well", "It kind of sounds like you're repeating your parents' relationship skills where there are people who matter and people who don't matter get very little attention. Lots of people are able to maintain relationships with their siblings and neices/nephews after they have their own family.", "Op, I mean you are right about not going to the wedding so soon after giving birth. It's a medical reason. \nNow.... This whole? She is going tk start her own family stuff and won't have time??\nShe IS your family, and people DO make time for their loved ones. \n\nI am just saying be careful on how you raise your children. If you are cool with raising three brothers and sister that will say they are not family with each other once they meet someone, that's cool. It just seems wrong.", "There must have been some seriously extenuating circumstances to your pregnancy if you couldn\u2019t at least estimate your due date as soon as you found out you were pregnant. \n\nBut that aside, many of us with careers, marriages and multiple children also find time to stay close to people we care about, it\u2019s just a matter of priorities. Your priorities are your prerogative and I\u2019m not going to tell you that you have to stay close to your sister, but it comes across as disingenuous when you claim it\u2019s something you can\u2019t do when in reality it\u2019s a choice.", "I'm not repeating my parent's parenting. Yes, I love my marriage, but I still show my child that she is loved, and I still enjoy annoying her and watching frozen with her. She's my little ladybug. \n\nSiblings grow out of each other. We aren't gonna be as close anymore, and that's okay. You can't compare the relationship that I have with my kid who literally came out of my vagina to my sister, whom I'm not close with anymore.", "How me and my sister were raised is completely different on how my kids are being raised. Yes, she's my family, but but in the same way as my husband and my kid. She's not the person I go to when things are wrong or when I'm upset my husband is. They are what I look forward to when I come home from work. My sister is a distant family member.", "She did not say they were not family anymore, just that her immediate family has changed and her focus is no longer her sister.
