I could stand a lot from him and regret how many times I told myself to suck it up when he'd say something to me but always drew the line at my kid. It didn't happen before but it does not need to happen more than once for him to make a habit out of it so I put it to a stop as I felt like it was the safest way. \n\nRegarding my son, he is doing good now and thanks to his therapist he has been getting better. He got his diagnosis in January and this Thursday he broke his record for our longest walk since, almost three hours. He also started getting out without me, thanks to one of his friends whom he met on a game about a year ago who recently moved to our city, I met him and his parents and they seem like amazing people so we did hand out at each other's houses since. \n\nWe do still have a lot to work on but I am happy to say that things are getting much better.", "created_utc": 1692575101, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wqx7z/aita_for_taking_my_agoraphobic_son_out_of_the/", "score": 140, "replies": ["Very good, I'm glad things worked out for you and your son! \ud83e\udd70", "Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14getlg/aita_for_taking_my_agoraphobic_son_out_of_the/", "Awesome news! Have a lovely rest of the summer!", "Do you think it's a coincidence that your son is now progressing mentally now that the boyfriend is gone?", "I was agoraphobic for many years due to a traumatic and I fought hard to get to the point I\u2019m at where I can leave my house for longer then 2hrs without panicking. I'm now able to go to school to become a teacher. The fact that your ex-boyfriend had a problem with your son leaving the house is insane!  Good for you for taking out the trash. Hopefully your son will continue to get better. It can happen.", "Makes me wonder if the boyfriend was being abusive to OPs son when she wasn't there to catch it."]}
