So basically I was out with my 2 best friends having some drinks around noon to celebrate me finishing my last semester of college. It was around 6PM and we decided to go get wings from a popular place in our city. My best friend who is gay has a boyfriend who for the sake of the story we will call Austin. Austin had just bought food at another local store with his bestfriend and arrived back at my best friend\u2019s apartment. The difference in food prompted my best friend to ask if Austin and his friends if they wanted to try the food. I jokingly said why didn\u2019t he ask me if I wanted to try. We both laughed a little and continued eating. Austin then laughs loudly and say that eating was how I got the way I was. For reference I am a 5\u201d3 female with natural curves a big bit and medium boobs. My stomach is indeed a little big but i honestly was never ashamed of my body, not proud but definitely not ashamed. I stopped and stared at him while everyone else went quiet. I packed up my stuff and immediately left and broke down crying as soon as I was out of earshot. I felt horrible and as the tears fell I heard my best friends coming out laughing and then stopped abruptly to ask why was I crying. My best friend who\u2019s dating Austin immediately started to say that I should let it bother me and that it was not a big deal. Before he could finish tho, Austin came out to see what was going on when my best friend said \u201c I was going through something .\u201d I sat silently during the car ride home and slammed the door when I was finally dropped off. I guess i overreacted but that genuinely hurt my feelings.

These people don\u2019t sound like your friends.  Maybe it\u2019s time to get some new friends now that you\u2019re out of college!", "Nta and you didn't overreact.  That was awful behavior on Austin's part.  He owes you an apology.", "NTA. You were absolutely not in the wrong for feeling hurt by Austin's comment. His remark was insensitive and hurtful, and it's completely natural to have an emotional reaction to such words. It's important to remember that your feelings are valid, and you have every right to be upset by something that made you uncomfortable.\n\nIn situations like this, it's important to prioritize your emotional well-being. If you feel comfortable, consider having an open and honest conversation with your best friend who's dating Austin. Explain how his comment affected you and why it hurt. Communication can help them understand your perspective better and ensure that such incidents are avoided in the future.\n\nIt's also important to surround yourself with friends who are understanding and supportive. Your best friend's initial dismissal of your feelings might have been unintentional, but it's important for them to acknowledge the impact of hurtful words on others.\n\nRemember, taking care of your emotional health is a priority. If you find that certain people or situations consistently make you feel uncomfortable or upset, it's okay to set boundaries to protect your well-being. Your feelings matter, and you deserve to be treated with respect and consideration.", "NTA. Feel better OP. I hope they apologize!!", "NTA and Austin was being rude. That's rough, and it's not wrong to remove yourself from a situation you feel horrible in, especially if you feel yourself welling up and want to be alone to process.", "NTA- drop them all ; no one gets to tell you what you should be bothered by", "NTA\n\nTake a break from bestie and his BF and see if he understands just how upset you were before resuming hangouts.", "NTA  \n\n\nboth dudes are big time assholes.", "NTA for your feelings, Austin made a joke and it didn\u2019t land and he should have apologized for that.\n\nThe only feedback I can offer is that when something is upsetting it\u2019s okay to take a moment to compose yourself but then you should have returned to the group and said comments about your body were neither appropriate nor humorous and were not the fodder for jokes going forward.\n\nRight not your friends are only hearing from your BF and Austin that everything is okay and you\u2019re just having a minor meltdown, you need to correct that if you don\u2019t want this to happen again.\n\nIf it does happen again after you\u2019ve made it clear these \u201cjokes\u201d are not funny then you know exactly who these people are.", "Nta, that wasn't a nice comment, he probably meant I jokingly but regardless it wasn't a funny joke and hurt you, your friend should've said something instead of saying it wasn't a big deal", "NTA.  Those aren't friends and as I'm a bit confused by your story, I can't tell if your good friend actually stood up for you, but it kinda didn't sound that way.   Austin is an AH Deluxe!    \nSomeone invites you into their place to have carryout and then allows their friend to be beyond rude to you and laughs about it.  You did the exact right thing and I don't think I'd ever speak to those people again.", "Nta he made a comment he shouldn\u2019t have, your \u201cfriend\u201d telling you to not let it get to you is bullshit.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have to have your boundaries. Dont be afraid to show there is a line you just dont cross.", "\nNTA, he was completely out of order.\n\nHowever if you are reduced to tears about it, you are definitely not 'not ashamed', maybe think that through then the cognitive dissonance won't be so harsh.", "NTA I'm so sorry this happend you didn't deserve that. everyone else was being super rude and Austins comment was so uncalled for. Im so sorry this happened, these people are just stupid", "NTA.  That guy is certain kind of hole.", "NTA. Hon, you have really sh*tty friends. \n\nNot sure if y'all are the type of friends for whom jokes and roasts are the norm, but even if that is the dynamic, the minute they realized actual harm had been done...they should have had your back.", "NTA i guess. \n\nBut what i don't understand is, from your post i get the impression you are fine with your body and don't have insecurities. So why is a comment from someone else triggering such a big reaction in you? You are giving other ppl a lot of power over how you feel. If you are fine with your body, how can anybody even insult your body to a point you suddendly feel bad about yourself?\n\nJust asking bc just like you, i'm fine with my body. But this also means i really do not care what other ppl think about it, like i really don't give a single fu*k about it. You can insult my body for hours and i would still don't even think about it. Sure, if your insults are good i'm carefully listening, maybe i can reuse some of them later, and i would even compliment you for the extraordinary good ones, but no way i would let your words hurt me in any way. And yes, thats soley my decision if i let you hurt me or not. I'm the master of my mind and my feelings, why should i give someone else the power to hurt me or make me feel bad?", "So do the friends", "This.  Nothing worse than when someone says that or \"don't be so sensitive\" - like having feelings is a negative."]}
