It\u2019s a small town where literally everybody moved away so it was nice to see everyone again. We hosted at our school gym and it was so fun. People were drunk before they even got there and of course brought booze with them. (Which was totally against the rules and agreement if they let us do it in the gym). One guy was even caught on camera bringing it in. Eventually things got crazy including one girl stomping a PA system and speaker with her heel busting it. And the cops came and shut us down. I was one of the few people who were sober. Passing both a breathalyzer and a straight line walk. The rest however were a mess. Fast forward to a few days later I get a phone call from one of the reunion hosts and he is pissed. He received a bill for over four thousand dollars in damages in fines. Including replacing the broken PA system and speaker. He then said everyone who attended the reunion should chip in and help foot the bill because he simply cannot come up with 4 grand on his own and if he doesn\u2019t they\u2019re going to take him to court over it. I told him I refuse to pay anymore money to the reunion and I\u2019m not paying for damages I did not do. I wasn\u2019t drinking, I passed my breathalyzer & I sure as hell didn\u2019t bring alcohol on campus, so why should I pay for it? A few others agreed with me because they were drinking either so they didn\u2019t want too as well. But the rest of them are saying we\u2019re awful for not wanting to help. \n\nSo I have to ask?

You shouldn't have to pay for something you didn't damage. The girl that stomped the amplifier should pay. The host probably signed a document saying he was responsible, so he owes the $4k.

You shouldn't have to pay for something you didn't do. If possible, see if you can get the record of you passing the breathalyzer and show the dude.", "NTA. You're not in school any more and don't have to be subjected to collective punishment because of your misbehaving classmates. If the organizers know who caused the damage then they need to deal directly with them.", "NTA\n\nIf you saw the woman break the PA system with her shoe, call the police and report her. Report anyone you saw causing damage and if I were you , I'd drop off a statement to the police stating what you did and didn't see. Absolutely refuse to pay if you didn't break any of the rules and didn't cause any damage. That's completely up to those that violated the agreement and caused damage.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t pay either", "NTA. You didn't break anything, you weren't drunk, its not your problem if others couldn't handle it.", "NTA. Absolutely not. They should've hired security. They can press those who caused the damages to pay.", "NTA. The damage should be paid for by the people who cause it, especially the girl who stomped on the PA system and speakers.", "The guy who signed the agreement is on the hook for the entire bill because it's just going to be easier on the school to just go after that one person.  He would have to sue everyone involved if there's documentation proving that they caused damages.  The host can huff and puff all he wants to, but unless you signed off on an agreement that you would be held liable for any damages, he can't do anything except ask for you to chip in, just like everyone else.  He was stupid for not getting insurance for the reunion.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why don't the drunks who caused the damage pay for it.", "Nta. People who caused the damage should pay for the damages. Nobody else. Why should you take any blame and pay for things you had nothing to do with? Thats just silly.", "NTA. It's not your fault your old classmates never grew up.", "NTA, for sure. the whole, \"guilty by association\" rhetoric is shameful. you abided by the rules, so you upheld your end of not fucking around and finding out. as for the rest who clearly couldn't give a shit, well, karma is a bitch. \n\non the other hand, I also graduated in a small town, with a small graduating class. unfortunately, getting drunk and acting a fool was always brushed off by others because that was basically the only form of entertainment to a group of kids.", "nta... but chipping in is the nice thing to do.", "INFO: how many people were there who would be included in helping pay?", "That\u2019s what I said I told him I wasn\u2019t paying anything because I didn\u2019t do anything.", "I didn\u2019t know you could get it!

You break it, you pay for it.", "Then the host can see who broke it and get the amount from them. He should NOT be asking you when he can clearly see who he should go after for the damages.

Its not the schools fualt, its not the party olanners fualt. Chipping in lightens the load for everyone to do a good thing.

I yeah i would say no to that. 30 to 50max for me.", "From what I see here I'm going with NTA.\n\nI'm wondering if the host called the people that got caught on camera beforehand and knows they don't have enough money to repay the $4k bill, hence why everyone should pay a part of this bill. Either way this reason is dumb imo. The people that broke things should assume their responsabilites and pay what they owe.", "If a bunch of people got arrested for PI I think they should pay for it.", ">People were drunk before they even got there and of course brought booze with them.

It sounds as though he was happy to let people do whatever they wanted but now is surprised that there are consequences and is trying to pass the buck.\n\nNTA and really I wouldn't pay anything on principle.", "I assume the whole event is on social media - time for the guy who\u2019s \u201don the hook\u201d to go through it, take screen shots of people causing damage (which, I\u2019m sure, was recorded as hilarious at the time) & chase them for money.
