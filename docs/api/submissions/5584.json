I put on makeup, did my hair, and dressed nicely since I wanted to take some pictures for Instagram.\n\nJust when we left, Jacob said he forgot the room key inside and suggested that I jump off the platform and swim around to get the key card. I refused, since I was all dressed up. He begged me to do it, since I can swim and he can\u2019t. I asked him how he expected me to get inside, and he said didn\u2019t close the terrace doors before we left, so I gave in.\n\nI stripped down and swam around. Got inside, opened the door for him so he could help me search, only to find out that he was playing a prank on me and had the key the entire time.\n\nI started yelling at him because he made me ruin my hair and makeup for nothing.
