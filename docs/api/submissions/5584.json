Some much needed info: our vacation spot was in an area with many islands and it\u2019s very hot. The hotel we\u2019re staying at is made up of a bunch of huts with private terraces that lead down to the water. When you leave your hut, there\u2019s a platform that connects to a bigger path that leads back to the hotel reception. Essentially, you could jump off the platform and swim around to your room\u2019s terrace. Sorry if that\u2019s a confusing description.\n\nYesterday was our last day at the hotel, so we packed our stuff up and were out the door early morning. I put on makeup, did my hair, and dressed nicely since I wanted to take some pictures for Instagram.\n\nJust when we left, Jacob said he forgot the room key inside and suggested that I jump off the platform and swim around to get the key card. I refused, since I was all dressed up. He begged me to do it, since I can swim and he can\u2019t. I asked him how he expected me to get inside, and he said didn\u2019t close the terrace doors before we left, so I gave in.\n\nI stripped down and swam around. Got inside, opened the door for him so he could help me search, only to find out that he was playing a prank on me and had the key the entire time.\n\nI started yelling at him because he made me ruin my hair and makeup for nothing. Mind you, I was soaking wet, looking like a fucking fish. We argued the entire way to the reception area, and I ended up just giving him the silent treatment until we got home.
