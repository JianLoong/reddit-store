While home I asked my parents if they wanted to put to dinner. They agreed and I choose a popular upscale restaurant that I know my mom has been eager to try. Usually when we go out to eat as a family my parents will pay with no questions asked. This seems ok to me considering this is an infrequent event as I only see them once per year. My brother's girlfriend (27F) was also around the day before so my mom told me to invite her as well (since I made the reservation) and said \"invite her I'm paying.\" As backstory my mom has a great soft spot for my brother's girlfriend and they've grown closer while I've been away to the point where I feel like my mom favors her to me. The dinner comes and it goes ok. When the check comes no one claims it. Embarrassed to cause a scene I quickly put down my credit card, and my mom says tell me how much my portion is. I'm a bit confused assuming she'd pay for the entire meal. When we get home I ask her what she means by her portion and she says she's only paying for my brother's girlfriends dinner. I ask why and she says it's bc I invited them. Im totally surprised bc our family has never operated this way. It wouldn't be a problem for me to pay for my own but I'm shocked she's expecting me to pay for my dad, brother, and her portions. I'm extremely hurt by the fact that she's paying for my brother's girlfriend's portion and not mine. It again shows a strange favoritism that I don't quite understand. Should I be so offended, or just suck it up and pay the bill? \n\nContext: I make ok money but my mom makes more than me and my brother's girlfriend makes more than me as well.\n\n\nEdit: I'm not expecting her to pay for everyone, but just assumed she'd pay for my dad and herself.", "created_utc": 1688490249, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qks5u/aita_for_asking_my_mom_to_pay_for_my_dinner/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You literally suggested the dinner and chose an expensive place. Your Mom offered to pay for your brother\u2019s girlfriend because it would be rude to invite her and expect you to pay for her dinner. But you don\u2019t seem to share your Mom\u2019s understanding of rudeness, since you invited them out to an expensive dinner that you expected *them* to pay for.\n\nLook, my parents usually pay for dinner when we go out but it\u2019s always their suggestion. I\u2019ve never in my life been like \u2018hey mom and dad let\u2019s go to this super expensive place, your treat!\u2019 You are almost 30. They\u2019re treating you like an adult with your own money, which you are.", "YTA - You're 29, you invited them out, picked the place, and made the reservation. It seems obvious that you would be paying. Your mother was gracious to offer to pay for the guest she invited. \n\nAssuming she would pay for your event is entitled.", "Hahaha!  You suggested the outing and the place and you\u2019re shocked you had to pay?  YTA", "YTA Technically, you invited them out or dinner. Your mother offered to pay for your brother's girlfriend because she extended the invitation. It sounds like it was a misunderstanding. Don't sulk and let it fester, just speak to your mother and clear up what happened.\n\nEdit: OP's edit is malarkey. OP's justification was she expected her mother to pay.", "YTA,\nYou invited everyone to dinner. You picked the restaurant AND then expected them to pay for it ? Really, your mom paid for your brother\u2019s girlfriend because she invited her as she said. I\u2019m confused why at 29 you expected your parents to pay for something you wanted and invited them to.", "I understand that your feelings are hurt by your mom's seeming preference of your brother's gf. You should have a conversation with her about that.\n\nA completely separate issue is the fact that you suggested and made plans for an upscale restaurant. You are an adult. It sounds like you issued an invitation that you expected others to literally pick up the tab for. YTA.", "YTA:   You're just mad your plan backfired, lol. You chose an upscale restaurant with the intentions of having your parents pay for everyone. They turned the tables and said well you invited us so it's your bill (and they're kinda right). Seems fair she pay for the gf because you didn't invite her your mom did", "YTA, you are old enough to know when you invite someone out for dinner, you should actually be paying.  You are the host.  If anything, you all pay for yourselves, but to invite people to dinner and expect them to pay, wow you have some nerve.  This is basic etiquette.  You sound like you are taking advantage of your parents.   you even chose an upscale place, and expected them to pay.  You need to grow up a bit.", "Sounds to me that your mum is sick of her freeloading kids., and maybe gf is the only one who's paid her way in the past.\n\nYTA for presuming that EVERY meal will be paid for by your parents. How old are you?  Would it hurt you to treat them once in a while?", "YTA. You asked them to go to an upscale restaurant and expected them to pay.", "YTA,\n\nyour mum does not pay for her as a favoritism, she pays for her because technically she invited the GF to \"your dinner\".\n\nWell next time either chose a place you can afford (don' t mind to afford), or wait if somebody else invites you instead,  :D", "Sounds like Mom is tired of being an ATM and is also trying to teach you basic ettiquette the hard way - the one who does the inviting usually pays unless it's explicitly decided ahead of time. The whole thing was made worse by your deliberately choosing an upscale restaurant and assuming your parents would foot the bill.I understand why you would be confused since the rules changed without discussion, so am going with ESH except your brother and his gf.", "Soft YTA. \n\nI can understand how you'd be a bit shocked and confused if the norms of going out to eat with your parents were broken. My husband's family is also that way where the parents pay for 100% of our meals no matter how much we protest (we also live in different states). But, what makes you the asshole is your insistence that it's because your mom favors your brother's girlfriend. They live in the same town. She likely goes to your house all the time. They would naturally get close. This doesn't mean your mom \"favors\" her more than you, her daughter. In the future, I'd expect to start paying for more of your own meals when going out, especially to nice restaurants.", "You ask if you should be offended. Yes. That hurts. The part about you inviting them and being responsible for the bill is logical.  The fact that she told you that you need to invite the gf logically means mom is responsible for gf\u2019s meal, not the result of favoritism. \n\nThis is an emotional response to a logical argument. Mom is right on all points so she won\u2019t see yours. If you tell her you miss her and it is making you jealous, she will be more understanding. \n\nSoft. Yta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I pick the restaurant, my sister picks the bar for after (we usually pub crawl to it, and end somewhere with live music) on this occasion mum and friend ALWAYS pay for everything, no matter how much we protest... but that's agreed in advance.\n\nThe important thing here is communication, at 29 and doing all the planning and inviting and booking, I'd be expecting you were paying if it wasnt discussed. \n\nEven among mates we communicate between \"fancy going to *insert restaurant name*, my treat\" and if we are splitting a bill. \n\nOnly time I don't bother with this conversation is with my mrs.

Next time, maybe stick with the Colonel.", "I think other folks probably have what was going on right -- you pay for the folks you invite, she paid for the one she invited\n\n... But your mom said \"Invite her I'm paying\" so I think it's not really on you that you thought she meant that for everyone vs \"Invite her, I'll cover her portion\" given the history\n\nI don't know that either of you is the AH because it sounds like a miscommunication more than anything but you should probably talk to your mom about feeling like your relationship is weaker than you want it to be.

It again shows a strange favoritism\n\nIt really doesn't sound like favouritism at all. The reason why your mom didn't offer to cover for your portion isn't that you've been replaced or that she loves you less, it's that she sincerely believed you were treating them to dinner. She only paid for your brothers' girlfriend because she is the one who added that guest and she didn't want to burden you.\n\n> Usually when we go out to eat as a family my parents will pay with no questions asked\n\nIt's not uncommon for families to have this dynamic and for this dynamic to evolve at some point after the kids stop being young adults. You are nearing 30 and this might be your clue that you can't expect your parents to automatically cover for the whole family every time.", "NTA - why aren\u2019t full grown adults paying for their own meals? Your brother is an adult. His gf- an adult! Your parents are senior citizens- geez!", "Esh.

But I think this was your mom signaling to you that it is past time for you to stop thinking of yourself as a dependent or kid when you visit. You are 29 and have a job so offering to pick up the check now and again is the appropriate move. I do it with my parents even though I know my dad would pay every time if I kept quiet. You invited them To go out and your mom asked to add an additional guest who she paid for, so it\u2019s not exactly out of line for you to pay for the rest. If that\u2019s really not financially feasible, I\u2019d either say upfront when planning everyone should pay for themselves or wait to see if they invite you to go out.", "She could have used her words.", "OP was the one who came up with idea, invited people, made the reservation. All mom did was invite the girlfriend and said she would pay for her, how did she engineer this?"]}
