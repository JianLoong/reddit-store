My husband researched how to get me out and came to visiting hours to talk it over every single day despite the facility being 2 hours away from our house. It's extremely difficult to persuade a court that the doctors and social workers allied against you have misjudged you. So he did what he could do, visited, brought me clothes and hygiene supplies and promised me the moment they released me he'd be there. And he was. He waited hours to make sure he would be.\n\nSince then he has held me through the bad memories and nightmares and not only can't I imagine him publicly mocking me about it, I can't imagine it privately. Some things make for gallows humor but not this. Not for me. I cannot fathom how your husband witnessed your experience and can find fun in it. There are events in my husband's history that are much the same. My sole job is to ease his burdens as I can. I don't think a couple should have to beg to share this value with each other. \n\nYou deserve no less.

The rage at you and the gaslighting is just the cherry on top. This to me does not say it is a momentary lapse, it says this person profoundly does not care about you. That they would then call you abusive is incredibly, damagingly manipulative and is trying to exploit your vulnerability and your sensitivity to brainwash you into casting yourself as the aggressor in their drama.

Ignore anyone who acts confused they are being a bad faith actor.", "Sadly, when I heard a 7 day involuntary hold I figured OP was female- seems doctors are more willing to do that to women.", "Yeah it reads very much as OP is a man and the spouse is a woman to me, because of what you said about the weakness and the emphasis on where the spouse slept that night, safety, and being abandoned, tbh. It\u2019s the kind of language that gets used when a woman is left somewhere overnight or something, in my experience.", "While true, does that particularly matter in this situation?  The fact is that regardless of their gender they were mistreated by the health system.  If OP is a woman, does that make it worse?  By that same coin, if OP is a man does it make it better?", "Cheers", "...you know nothing about OP's level of loneliness or whether she lies to people about this or anything else.\n\n...you know nothing about OP's support network, professional help, or level of openness on other topics\n\nNot wanting to tell a room of strangers and acquaintances about one of your most traumatic experiences has no bearing on any of this and isn't a lie. It's not like someone asked her if she's ever been hospitalized and she said no. But even if that did happen, no one is entitled to that info. The asker would be TA.\n\nAt first I thought you were just ignorant but now it's patently clear you're trolling", "Exactly he can\u2019t joke about op diagnosis. If they were speaking about the cost of the health care he could say \u201coh like the time you needed to go the hospital near our holiday and we couldn\u2019t go\u201d, nobody would have know the details and he could have vent about the money. \n\nBut he did joke about a traumatic event for OP. We can\u2019t punt on the same level don\u2019t go to holiday and begin held against your will.", "In absolute fairness, I thought \u201csingular they\u201d was kind of silly until I realized just how many trans and non-binary (and non-binary trans, etc.) people there were (and how many I *knew*) and that I needed something better to call them, lol.  And then again when I realized that someone on twitter with a jokey username and an anime or Minecraft avatar didn\u2019t give me a whole lot to go on in terms of pronouns, and \u201csingular they\u201d was right there \u2026", "I just noticed I did and thought the same thing. They do that to women.", "Or trans, you probably get an even higher chance as a trans man.\n\nOr it could be a cis gay man, they can get a lot of shit too.\n\nCis straight man is most unlikely I would agree.", "The safety emphasis was around driving drunk, which I hope is a genderless concern.", "A-fucking-men", "No, is anyone here even making that argument?", "No. OP's spouse has a right to talk and joke about OP's spouse's life. OP is trying to deny that.", "He joked about the bill. Not about the diagnosis.", "Yes but that\u2019s not solely how it reads. They also talked about the spouse being \u2018abandoned\u2019 at a place where they were surrounded by people they knew and liked, which is how you\u2019d talk about a woman being left somewhere safe overnight if they were stranded somewhere.", "Implicitly, yes. There's no other reason to discuss OP's gender this much when they intentionally left it vague by using gender neutral language. People should respect OP's privacy instead of projecting their gender politics onto OP's post.", "Seriously?  No!  \n\nPeople have a right to medical privacy.  It\u2019s actually the law!\n\nAlso, we don\u2019t \u2018out\u2019 people.  People get to make a conscious choice to tell their stories and feel safe.  Not ridiculed or humiliated publicly.\n\nOP owes you nothing.", "Do you joke about your illness on your own accord or do other people make fun of you for it? Use your illness as a joke? Do they make you the punchline to people you dont know? Or just to people you might? \n\nAlso stigma comes from people who shame others for having a difference. Not the people who decide not to share them. Wanted to squeeze it into 1 comment not 2. If you want to share your differences fine. But OP is not obligated to share their struggles for the satisfaction of others.", "You realise OP was surrounded by people they didn't really know, the spouses friends, not theirs?\n\nAnd they weren't sat discussing mental health and making jokes about their own issues. \n\nOPs spouse made a joke including private medical information, which no one there knew, without OPs prior knowledge or consent.", ">OP's spouse has a right to talk and joke about OP's spouse's life.\n\nNot when OP is the one affected by that nice little joke.\n\n>OP is trying to deny that.\n\nYou're the one trying to deny OP's right to keep their medical information private, nice try shifting the blame Mrs. \"I had a  Traumatic Childbirth so I can dictate how others share their trauma\".", "You already tried that angle in another part of the thread and got rightfully put in your place by OP. \n\nYou're bouncing around all over trying to justify a terrible take. You can do what you like with your own trauma and discuss what you like with your own friends, but you're being gross in your responses to this.", "Guess what, you also don\u2019t get to dictate whether OP should share this even with friends. What is going on with you here? Do you just assume everyone and everything can only occur through the exact same lens that you live your life?  \nI get that this is essentially an opinion sub, but your reasoning for why OP is the asshole is purely based on the fact that you see life through a very narrow lens and obviously can\u2019t fathom that other people view trauma differently. So maybe your opinion of this has too much bias. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you would do this differently or whatever\u2014what matters is that this was a trauma event and for OP this moment of their spouse making a joke about it clearly brought back the feeling of trauma again. **It is OP\u2019s trauma.** Yeah you can say that the spouse shared in it to some extent, but it\u2019s not their place to decide whether OP is ready to joke about it. It\u2019s not yours either.  \nOP is not in a place mentally to discuss this openly with everyone and the fact that OP isn\u2019t ready is something entirely between OP and their therapist and has *nothing to do with you or I or honestly even OP\u2019s spouse considering the fact that they clearly don\u2019t think of OP\u2019s feelings enough to even consider that this joke was not the right choice for OP.* Whether you are okay with opening up about your trauma or not has literally *zero* bearing on how *anyone else feels about their trauma.*", "OP commented directly to you stating OP considered those people strangers through the question they gave you that you tried your best to ignore. You can stfu now.", "But he shared the diagnosis with plenty of people that didn\u2019t know about it.", "I think it's more unclear than you're making it out to be - but also that it doesn't really matter what the gender is for the AITA purposes, it just matters for a broader society commentary.\n\nFWIW, I am a cis bisexual woman and I read it as the OP being a woman because of the way society tends to control and mock women's mental health. The partner could be easily a man - all of those are things that I could 100% see a manipulative dudebro who think's he's a big old laugh at a party saying. The partner could also be a woman, I could also see that exchange happening BUT it'd have to be a specific type of woman because most I know wouldn't make a joke about \"money\" like that? I associate jokes about money fairly strongly with cis het dudes who think they're funnier than they are. Women - again, in my experience - generally don't talk quite that openly about money. Edit to be EXTRA clear: It's entirely possible both the OP and the SO are women. Both could be men, but I'd be kind of surprised if the OP was a man.\n\nBut also, everyone involved could be queer AF with identities and genitalia across the rainbow of possibilities. We don't know. It doesn't matter for AITA purposes. And all of this is going to be colored by the social circles and cultures that the reader is coming from.", "That's funny because I got the same reasoning, opposite conclusion: OP as a woman still caring for their SO even if hurt/angry and thinking about the whole car key / not leaving them stranded \n\nAnd the SO I'm not sure but I got more of a guy vibe, especially with the not apologysing / angry (not afraid) at not getting a ride / the accuse of abuse when they're the one who fucked up \nNot saying women don't do that kind of shit of course, as usual, but it felt more guyy", "OP owes me nothing, but OP owes OP's spouse something. It's their life, too, not just OP's.", "It would not even occur to me to get upset that my spouse jokes about fertility treaments. They affect the whole family, not just me and my rotten eggs, so the whole family can joke about it with whoever they like.\n\nThe kids also have told everyone they know.", "The spouse knew them. The spouse joked about the spouse's life.", "I'm not dictating OP to do anything, OP can share or not share, but OP also doesn't get to dictate what OP's spouse does, the spouse can share or not share. Nothing wrong with either. The people around OP don't stop living, feeling, talking, joking and communicating about events in their life even if OP has a trauma. OP is trying to force them not to, and that's not acceptable.", "They were OP's spouse's friends. The spouse talked about the spouse's own life, which included having to pay for OP's psych ward costs.", "It doesn\u2019t matter, but this is a discussion forum. I\u2019m having a discussion. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as unclear as you make it sound if you\u2019ve been around people who talk about leaving women in situations like that. That\u2019s exactly the way they talk about it if they want to make it clear they were safe and not at all in danger of staying the night somewhere. People don\u2019t usually word things exactly that way when talking about leaving a man somewhere over night because the difference between leaving a man and a woman stranded and drunk is\u2026 you know, rather distinct, at least to someone aware of that.\n\nAlso, that might not be how women you know talk but I\u2019ve definitely met some that do, and that treat a man\u2019s mental health as flippantly as this person did. \n\nIt could easily be either or, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s for sure that. But that\u2019s my read on it.", ">society tends to control and mock women's mental health.\n\nFun fact: society doesn't give a flying f#ck about men's mental health either.", "They included private medical information about OP in that joke, which OP never gave consent to be shared in that company.", "Im all for breaking the stigma about mental health wards.\n\nBut people should *choose* whether or not they want to add their story to the fight. Consent is an absolutely huge, huge thing and he did not consent for his stay, his bills, or his health to be talked or joked about.\n\nIf you say its okay, or you get someones okay, then and *only* then is it okay for you to discuss it or make jokes of it.", ">They were OP's spouse's friends.\n\nAnd so they must also be OP's friends when OP literally considered them strangers and made comments about that? Are you too dumb to realize or just deliberately ignoring this to support your argument? \n\n>The spouse talked about the spouse's own life, which included having to pay for OP's psych ward costs.\n\nThat should stop at the costs, not ongoing blabbering about what happened to OP during the hospitalization."]}
