My husband researched how to get me out and came to visiting hours to talk it over every single day despite the facility being 2 hours away from our house. It's extremely difficult to persuade a court that the doctors and social workers allied against you have misjudged you. So he did what he could do, visited, brought me clothes and hygiene supplies and promised me the moment they released me he'd be there. And he was. He waited hours to make sure he would be.\n\nSince then he has held me through the bad memories and nightmares and not only can't I imagine him publicly mocking me about it, I can't imagine it privately. Some things make for gallows humor but not this. Not for me. I cannot fathom how your husband witnessed your experience and can find fun in it. There are events in my husband's history that are much the same. My sole job is to ease his burdens as I can. I don't think a couple should have to beg to share this value with each other. \n\nYou deserve no less.

The hold was in some ways more traumatic than the attempt itself, and as someone immediately adjacent, I could never make it a punchline.\n\nI find it incredibly troubling that your spouse not only did that but when confronted and called out, did not back down, apologize, admit fault at all. The rage at you and the gaslighting is just the cherry on top. This to me does not say it is a momentary lapse, it says this person profoundly does not care about you. That they would then call you abusive is incredibly, damagingly manipulative and is trying to exploit your vulnerability and your sensitivity to brainwash you into casting yourself as the aggressor in their drama.

You go to the hospital for a broken leg the hospital generally doesn\u2019t have a fence with razor wire around it.
