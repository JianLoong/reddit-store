I have a bio daughter named Jessica (she's 18). And I also have two stepdaughters named Monica and Leah. They're 25 & 28. Both are single moms and live with us currently.\n\nthere's been issues about my stepdaughters asking my daughter to babysit the kids. Jessica didn't have a problem with it at first since this is what she does to earn money but since her stepsisters don't pay her much, she'd just refuse to babysit. We worked this out by having my wife take care of paying for the babysitting.\n\n\nI planned a family vacation for 3 days and everyone wanted to go. However, Both Monica & Leah suggested that Jessica stay home and watch the kids since Beth doesn't want her grandkids to come. They said it's because the kids are used to Jessica and hiring another babysitter would cause issues. And also said that Jessica isn't too \"fond\" of our destination but it was obvious that Jessica wanted to go. They insisted and Beth offered to pay her double and there was just..a lot of back and forth on this til I demanded they stop bringing it up.\n\nWe were supposed to go last week but when everybody had bagged their bags and was time to go, Jessica found out that she didn't have her passport on her. We searched her bag then went home and searched there. Beth and my stepdaughters kept insisting that we go back to the airport or else we'd miss our flight. They insisted that Jessica stay at home with the kids. They even told the new babysitter to go home cause she was no longer needed. I refused to go and kept searching for the passport til Monica admitted that she helped Leah hide Jessica's passport to get her to stay home with the kids. I was livid I tried to get her to tell me where it was but she said Leah had it, Leah denied so I threatened to cancel the vacation that's when they gave it back. I decided to actually cancel the vacation and blew up at both of them and berated them. They stayed upstairs for a while and Beth refused to speak to me and said that I punished my stepdaughters for worrying about their kids and wanting them to stay with someone they know. I got told I overreacted and ruined the trip for everybody.\n\nEditing to mention that kicking my stepdaughters out isn't possible since my wife co-owns the house that we currently live in.", "created_utc": 1685212599, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13terws/aita_for_cancelling_the_entire_vacation_when_i/", "score": 25233, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They are responsible for their children. Requiring your youngest to take on that role is not only unfair, but some serious conversations need to be held about boundaries, and respect.

Talk about evil step sisters.  I call BS on your wife\u2019s logic.  Your daughter is not responding for the kids and your wife\u2019s evil daughters could have stayed home with their own kids if they were so worried about child care.

They didn't act out of worry about their kids; they committed a crime in order to force their stepsister out of the vacation and leave her with no choice but to act as their skivvy, because they felt entitled to her time and effort.

You would have been a terrible father.)\n\nGet that passport back and don't apologise for defending Jessica against targeted abuse.\n\nAlso? You might need to think real hard about whether this is part of a pattern of behaviour, or whether their attitudes have changed recently.

I have a bio daughter named Jessica (she's 18). And I also have two stepdaughters named Monica and Leah. They're 25 & 28. Both are single moms and live with us currently.\n\nthere's been issues about my stepdaughters asking my daughter to babysit the kids. Jessica didn't have a problem with it at first since this is what she does to earn money but since her stepsisters don't pay her much, she'd just refuse to babysit. We worked this out by having my wife take care of paying for the babysitting.\n\n\nI planned a family vacation for 3 days and everyone wanted to go. However, Both Monica & Leah suggested that Jessica stay home and watch the kids since Beth doesn't want her grandkids to come. They said it's because the kids are used to Jessica and hiring another babysitter would cause issues. And also said that Jessica isn't too \"fond\" of our destination but it was obvious that Jessica wanted to go. They insisted and Beth offered to pay her double and there was just a lot of back and forth on this til I demanded they stop bringing it up.\n\nWe were supposed to go last week but when everybody had bagged their bags and was time to go, Jessica found out that she didn't have her passport on her. We searched her bag then went home and searched there. Beth and my stepdaughters kept insisting that we go back to the airport or else we'd miss our flight. They insisted that Jessica stay at home with the kids. They even told the new babysitter to go home cause she was no longer needed. I refused to go and kep searching for the passport til Monica admitted that she helped Leah hide Jessica's passport to get her to stay home with the kids. I was livid I tried to get her to tell me where it was but she said Leah had it, Leah denied so I threatened to cancel the vacation that's when they gave it back. I decided to actually cancel the vacation and blew up at both of them and berated them. They stayed upstairs for a while and Bethvrefused to speak to me and said that I punished my stepdaughters for worrying about their kids and wanting them to stay with someone they know. I got told I overreacted and ruined the trip for everybody.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As co-owner of the house, you have equal say in who does and does not live there.   They are adults, they should be responsible for maintaining a roof over their own heads and their children.

Maybe they wouldn't have to worry about anything, but still.... I wouldn't want to leave them in that house without me and my daughter in there knowing how mad they would be with that situation. The step-daughters would probably trash OPs and his daughter's shit.", "This is the right answer", "u/Positive-Elk-8110 you need to read this comment. \n\nWait until your wife and stepdaughters are out of the house and then ask your daughter to be honest with you about how your wife treats her when you're not around, and how her stepsisters treat her when you're not around. If they were willing to pull this vacation bullshit (which your wife was clearly in on) I would bet Jessica is treated far worse than you think. No joke, this feels like a modern Cinderella story. \n\nYour daughter deserves better than this and your loyalty should lie with her rather than your wife and stepdaughters. As someone who is dealing with something similar, this is the kind of thing where your daughter will end up cutting all contact with you. It's your job to protect her and have her back and you are failing miserably at it by letting your wife and stepdaughters treat her like this. \n\nThere needs to be immediate consequences for this behavior and some strong boundary setting followed by actually enforcing those boundaries. Some possibilities:\n\nEveryone needs to apologize to Jessica.\n\nJessica will no longer be available to babysit (unless she freely decides to with no coercion or bullying or guilt tripping or manipulating from anyone) so stepdaughters will need to find alternative childcare just like every other single mom has to do. If it's such a big deal your wife can babysit her own goddamn grandkids for the pennies your stepdaughters are willing to offer.\n\nJessica needs a *keyed* lock on her bedroom door if there isn't one already so she has somewhere safe to retreat to. You can keep a spare for emergencies *as long as you tell absolutely no one else where it is besides Jessica*. The point is to keep everyone else out of her space in case of retaliation.\n\nJessica is only responsible for herself and her own needs. No cleaning up after other people, no taking care of kids, nothing except letting her live her life as independently as possible given the situation. She's an adult and deserves to be treated like one.\n\nAt a minimum, wife needs to agree to marriage counseling. There needs to be a plan in place with concrete steps and timelines. If she doesn't meet them, divorce. If she refuses counseling or apologizing for her abhorrent behavior, divorce. If she continues to enable her daughters and treat Jessica poorly, divorce. And then you need to follow through on this. \n\nQuietly look into what it would take for you to either move out or buy out your wife regarding the house. Is her name on the actual deed or just the mortgage? Mortgage =/= deed.\n\nConsult a divorce lawyer to find out what your options are even if you don't end up going down that road. A lot of them will do free consultations. It's better to be prepared than to scramble to find someone should you need it. \n\nUpdate the beneficiaries on any accounts. If it were me, Jessica would be the sole beneficiary unless you are 100% committed to continuing the marriage (fully knowing your wife and stepdaughters aren't going to change). Updating your will (or writing one if you don't have one) would also be a good idea. Do these things quietly so no one flips shit. If things end up working out with the wife you can always change them back. \n\nRight now your greatest concern needs to be your own child. Not your wife, not your stepdaughters. *Your own child*. Wife and stepdaughters have made it very clear through their actions that they do not accept Jessica as family, do not respect her, and do not think she deserves to be treated like a human being.\n\n*When someone shows you who they are, listen THE FIRST TIME*. They are not going to change. This is who they are. It's your job as a parent to look out for your own children and prioritize them over a new wife and stepdaughters who only care about themselves.\n\nJessica is watching your every move, I guarantee it. How you handle this situation will likely determine the relationship you have with her going forward. Are your terrible wife and stepdaughters worth more to you than your own daughter? If she means anything to you at all, if you value your relationship with her at all, *you will do what's necessary to rectify this situation to HER SATISFACTION and protect her going forward*, even if that means divorcing your wife.\n\nAlso, why tf would you stay married to such a mean, cruel person? Grow a backbone and protect your daughter. Your wife and stepdaughters are grown ass adults who can take care of themselves. Your daughter is still a fucking teenager and could really use someone looking out for her. *If you love your daughter, you will be that person for her.*", "The perfect time to do this would be to plan another vacation, for just OP and his daughter and tell the rest to F off", "Thank you kind internet stranger for the award\n\nOP please talk to your daughter.

If they were willing to pull this vacation bullshit (which your wife was clearly in on) I would bet Jessica is treated far worse than you think. No joke, this feels like a modern Cinderella story. \n\nYour daughter deserves better than this and your loyalty should lie with her rather than your wife and stepdaughters. As someone who is dealing with something similar, this is the kind of thing where your daughter will end up cutting all contact with you. It's your job to protect her and have her back and you are failing miserably at it by letting your wife and stepdaughters treat her like this. \n\nThere needs to be immediate consequences for this behavior and some strong boundary setting followed by actually enforcing those boundaries. Some possibilities:\n\nEveryone needs to apologize to Jessica.\n\nJessica will no longer be available to babysit (unless she freely decides to with no coercion or bullying or guilt tripping or manipulating from anyone) so stepdaughters will need to find alternative childcare just like every other single mom has to do. If it's such a big deal your wife can babysit her own goddamn grandkids for the pennies your stepdaughters are willing to offer.\n\nJessica needs a *keyed* lock on her bedroom door if there isn't one already so she has somewhere safe to retreat to. You can keep a spare for emergencies *as long as you tell absolutely no one else where it is besides Jessica*. The point is to keep everyone else out of her space in case of retaliation.\n\nJessica is only responsible for herself and her own needs. No cleaning up after other people, no taking care of kids, nothing except letting her live her life as independently as possible given the situation. She's an adult and deserves to be treated like one.\n\nAt a minimum, wife needs to agree to marriage counseling. There needs to be a plan in place with concrete steps and timelines. If she doesn't meet them, divorce. If she refuses counseling or apologizing for her abhorrent behavior, divorce. If she continues to enable her daughters and treat Jessica poorly, divorce. And then you need to follow through on this. \n\nQuietly look into what it would take for you to either move out or buy out your wife regarding the house. Is her name on the actual deed or just the mortgage? Mortgage =/= deed.\n\nConsult a divorce lawyer to find out what your options are even if you don't end up going down that road. A lot of them will do free consultations. It's better to be prepared than to scramble to find someone should you need it. \n\nUpdate the beneficiaries on any accounts. If it were me, Jessica would be the sole beneficiary unless you are 100% committed to continuing the marriage (fully knowing your wife and stepdaughters aren't going to change). Updating your will (or writing one if you don't have one) would also be a good idea. Do these things quietly so no one flips shit. If things end up working out with the wife you can always change them back. \n\nRight now your greatest concern needs to be your own child. Not your wife, not your stepdaughters. *Your own child*. Wife and stepdaughters have made it very clear through their actions that they do not accept Jessica as family, do not respect her, and do not think she deserves to be treated like a human being.\n\n*When someone shows you who they are, listen THE FIRST TIME*. They are not going to change. This is who they are. It's your job as a parent to look out for your own children and prioritize them over a new wife and stepdaughters who only care about themselves.\n\nJessica is watching your every move, I guarantee it. How you handle this situation will likely determine the relationship you have with her going forward. Are your terrible wife and stepdaughters worth more to you than your own daughter? If she means anything to you at all, if you value your relationship with her at all, *you will do what's necessary to rectify this situation to HER SATISFACTION and protect her going forward*, even if that means divorcing your wife.\n\nAlso, why tf would you stay married to such a mean, cruel person? Grow a backbone and protect your daughter. Your wife and stepdaughters are grown ass adults who can take care of themselves. Your daughter is still a fucking teenager and could really use someone looking out for her. *If you love your daughter, you will be that person for her.*\n\nNTA for canceling the vacation (best choice in the situation other than going anyway and taking just Jessica, leaving the other baggage at home) but Y T A for not protecting your *actual daughter* from your cruel and manipulative wife and stepdaughters.\n\nAlso, get Jessica into therapy with a good trauma informed therapist. She undoubtedly needs SOMEONE who will listen to her and help her process things in a safe environment, because *her own home isn't even safe for her to exist in* and that's seriously fucked up.\n\nPlease OP, do better. Your daughter deserves better.", "Agreed.  \n\nu/Positive-Elk-8110  \nOP: Your wife and stepdaughters have been taking advantage of your own daughter - your flesh and blood - and manipulating you in the process, and now they have outright schemed to exclude her from your family vacation, and *stolen* - not \"hidden\", but **stolen** her passport from her to *force* her to be unable to come with you.\n\nThis is not about babysitting.  This is about taking advantage, being abusive, and being manipulative AHs.\n\nYou owe loyalty to your actual blood-related daughter, who has done nothing to deserve this treatment.  You must stand by her, and *not* the wife and stepdaughters who have been so cruel to her, and who have been so deceitful to you.\n\nYou also don't know if these schemey, conspiring AHs are using her passport or the information in it in identity theft and/or associated fraud.  You *must* get that passport back ASAP.\n\nThere is also the issue that stealing a U.S. passport if a federal crime...\n\n There are a number of federal laws that deal with the theft of passports. The most relevant law is 18 U.S.C. Section 1028, which covers fraud and related activity in connection with identification documents.

The maximum penalty for this crime is 15 years in prison. \n\nIf they haven't returned it yet, make sure to let them know.
