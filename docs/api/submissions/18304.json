I have a bio daughter named Jessica (she's 18). And I also have two stepdaughters named Monica and Leah. They're 25 & 28. Both are single moms and live with us currently.\n\nthere's been issues about my stepdaughters asking my daughter to babysit the kids. Jessica didn't have a problem with it at first since this is what she does to earn money but since her stepsisters don't pay her much, she'd just refuse to babysit. We worked this out by having my wife take care of paying for the babysitting.\n\n\nI planned a family vacation for 3 days and everyone wanted to go. However, Both Monica & Leah suggested that Jessica stay home and watch the kids since Beth doesn't want her grandkids to come. They said it's because the kids are used to Jessica and hiring another babysitter would cause issues. And also said that Jessica isn't too \"fond\" of our destination but it was obvious that Jessica wanted to go. They insisted and Beth offered to pay her double and there was just..a lot of back and forth on this til I demanded they stop bringing it up.\n\nWe were supposed to go last week but when everybody had bagged their bags and was time to go, Jessica found out that she didn't have her passport on her. We searched her bag then went home and searched there. Beth and my stepdaughters kept insisting that we go back to the airport or else we'd miss our flight. They insisted that Jessica stay at home with the kids. They even told the new babysitter to go home cause she was no longer needed. I refused to go and kept searching for the passport til Monica admitted that she helped Leah hide Jessica's passport to get her to stay home with the kids. I was livid I tried to get her to tell me where it was but she said Leah had it, Leah denied so I threatened to cancel the vacation that's when they gave it back. I decided to actually cancel the vacation and blew up at both of them and berated them. They stayed upstairs for a while and Beth refused to speak to me and said that I punished my stepdaughters for worrying about their kids and wanting them to stay with someone they know. I got told I overreacted and ruined the trip for everybody.", "created_utc": 1685212599, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13terws/aita_for_cancelling_the_entire_vacation_when_i/", "score": 2053, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They are responsible for their children. Requiring your youngest to take on that role is not only unfair, but some serious conversations need to be held about boundaries, and respect.

Talk about evil step sisters.  I call BS on your wife\u2019s logic.  Your daughter is not responding for the kids and your wife\u2019s evil daughters could have stayed home with their own kids if they were so worried about child care.

They didn't act out of worry about their kids; they committed a crime in order to force their stepsister out of the vacation and leave her with no choice but to act as their skivvy, because they felt entitled to her time and effort.

You would have been a terrible father.)\n\nGet that passport back and don't apologise for defending Jessica against targeted abuse.\n\nAlso? You might need to think real hard about whether this is part of a pattern of behaviour, or whether their attitudes have changed recently.

I have a bio daughter named Jessica (she's 18). And I also have two stepdaughters named Monica and Leah. They're 25 & 28. Both are single moms and live with us currently.\n\nthere's been issues about my stepdaughters asking my daughter to babysit the kids. Jessica didn't have a problem with it at first since this is what she does to earn money but since her stepsisters don't pay her much, she'd just refuse to babysit. We worked this out by having my wife take care of paying for the babysitting.\n\n\nI planned a family vacation for 3 days and everyone wanted to go. However, Both Monica & Leah suggested that Jessica stay home and watch the kids since Beth doesn't want her grandkids to come. They said it's because the kids are used to Jessica and hiring another babysitter would cause issues. And also said that Jessica isn't too \"fond\" of our destination but it was obvious that Jessica wanted to go. They insisted and Beth offered to pay her double and there was just a lot of back and forth on this til I demanded they stop bringing it up.\n\nWe were supposed to go last week but when everybody had bagged their bags and was time to go, Jessica found out that she didn't have her passport on her. We searched her bag then went home and searched there. Beth and my stepdaughters kept insisting that we go back to the airport or else we'd miss our flight. They insisted that Jessica stay at home with the kids. They even told the new babysitter to go home cause she was no longer needed. I refused to go and kep searching for the passport til Monica admitted that she helped Leah hide Jessica's passport to get her to stay home with the kids. I was livid I tried to get her to tell me where it was but she said Leah had it, Leah denied so I threatened to cancel the vacation that's when they gave it back. I decided to actually cancel the vacation and blew up at both of them and berated them. They stayed upstairs for a while and Bethvrefused to speak to me and said that I punished my stepdaughters for worrying about their kids and wanting them to stay with someone they know. I got told I overreacted and ruined the trip for everybody.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Wouldn't have thought of this. I would have thought I was being fair by making everyone stay but didn't see it from Jessica's point of view in having her holiday cancelled when she hasn't done anything wrong. Great suggestion \ud83d\udc4c", "Except Jessica", "That'd be an ESH then, no? YTA absolves the ***actual*** assholes of their wrongdoings.", "He\u2019s definitely TA to Jessica by forcing her to stay in an environment where she is clearly used, punished and despised for not being a single mum herself.

ESH But OP, you have the biggest obligation to Jessica so you are the biggest AH here.", "Anyone else getting Cinderella vibes but with the dad still in the picture?", "Agreed. Talk about a textbook Cinderella story. I really hope she becomes Queen and seeks vengeance soon", "Except he didn\u2019t allow them to treat her like that at all he did exactly what he should\u2019ve done besides taking just him and his daughter on the vacation I think they should\u2019ve went alone and I honestly think after reading some of these comments he will realize how bad it is and leave the wife or atleast set boundaries about his daughter and the stepdaughters", "Yeah. Jessica is the victim here in every sense.", "Jessica sounds like a modern Cinderella and the stepsisters as the evil stepsisters. Please get a divorce and throw the 3 evil women out of the house!", "Op is the only one that stood up for Jessica, wtf", "What the hell did the dad do?", "She's ops daughter", "you mean bio-daughter :)", "Something tells me dad foots the bill for probably pretty much everything.", "Why does it matter?", "This!", "Such a good comment. Totally agree.", "This!!! Talk to your daughter one on one. I wonder how many other things like this, smaller and less noticeable, have happened as well. Good luck. I pray for both of your sakes this was a one off incident. I have a feeling it wasn\u2019t their kids your stepdaughters were worried about and your wife knows it. Sounds like your daughter is being pushed out so your wife and step daughters can \u201chave one big happy family\u201d without \u201cthe outsider\u201d. Please talk to your child and REALLY listen to her!", "And update the will in secret before taking any steps forward!", "OP needs to ditch all 5 of them (don't forget the 2 actual kiddies)", "I was just about to say this. The wife obviously knew what the stepdaughter were up to, and her response proves it. Also... who tells the babysitter to go home?  They were counting on OP being more concerned about going on the trip than finding his daughter's passport.  The stepdaughter and wife are trying to treat OP's daughter like a modern-day Cinderella.  I'm not saying g that he should divorce his wife, but he should seriously reconsider if his marriage, in it's current iteration, is a healthy situation to be in.", "What about the part where evil stepmother doesn't want HER grandkids to come on the vacay??... which led to all of this chaos!!", "I also thought: WTF am I reading? Cinderella?", "I would\u2019ve canceled everyone\u2019s vacation except mine and bio daughter.

They\u2019re trying to turn your daughter into Cinderella.", "She doesn't see your daughter as hers, and that's a problem. Your daughter is a convenient method for her to spend time with HER daughters without the grandkids around. It's a double bonus for her because she can still be 'mom', but she doesn't have to be 'mom' to your child. That's a problem. Especially when it gets to people 10 years older than her (with at least one of them) bullying her into watching their children. They're making excuses and your wife doesn't see a problem with it.\n\nI feel sorry for you and your daughter that you've finally realized this. I'd consider therapy or a counselor before divorce, but if she insists she did nothing wrong, you can't change her mind or her set opinion.

Just the two of you.", "You and your daughter are basically living with a bunch of moochers. A couple of adult women hid a teenager\u2019s passport in order to leave her behind and force her to babysit *when they already had a babysitter.* There was literally no reason for this other than greed and selfishness. \n\n*And your wife thinks you\u2019re overreacting.* This is not the behavior of someone who cares about you or your daughter. The fact that all three of them expected you to just go along with it is concerning. Have they treated Jessica so poorly for so long they\u2019ve become complacent, assuming you know and don\u2019t care? I\u2019d have a chat with Jessica to see what else they\u2019ve said and done to her. \n\nNTA, but you need to reassess everything: your marriage, their living situation, their treatment of Jessica when you weren\u2019t around. All of it. Keep an eye on your bank accounts and investments as well. Those are the things your wife and step kids care about (other than themselves).", "Good. If it were me, this would be divorce territory. I would never let anyone treat my daughter like this. NTA", "You and Jessica deserve so much better.  What kind of mother's would prefer to leave their kids with an 18yr old than have a few fun filled days with the house to themselves as a mini family. They're dead weight around your and your daughters necks. Absolutely abhorrent behavior and backed up by your entitled wife.  No doubt you paid for the entire family too.  \n Your daughter is still young and these women are outright villainous bullies.", "Yes, you are right. I forgot to include the wife.", "Divorce and make her buy you out so you and daughter can live somewhere that daughter isn\u2019t treated like Cinderella.", "At least that way if you divorce her you won't lose half the value of the house, because half of it is already hers.", "Then it's time for you to start looking for a place for you and your daughter to move to while you work out not co-owning this house.  STBX wife will need to buy your part out.", "It\u2019s not going to be easy to financially disentangle from her, but it\u2019s not going to be any easier to live with her and her daughters for however long this nonsense would otherwise continue.

You are just taking things at face value but a situation like this doesn't pop up overnight.

This whole thing sounds like cinderella, evil stepmom and sister included. I feel so sorry for that girl, you just know that this wasn't the first time the three of them pulled something on her.\n\nOP should have a good talk with his daughter and really start listening to her and protecting her.
