His family went on a small vacation recently and invited both of their son\u2019s partners (their younger sister isn\u2019t in a relationship so was allowed to bring a friend).\n\nTheir parents decided it would be fun if each night a different person got to pick where we went for dinner, that also worked out since we would be there for 7 nights and there was 8 of us (my bf\u2019s parents picked together instead of separately)\n\nThe problem comes with the fact that I don\u2019t like Asian food. I don\u2019t like how it smells and I find a lot of it tastes weird or too strong. While most people picked normal places (his parents picked an Italian place and his sister, picked a Mexican place, her friend picked a local restaurant (so normal food) and my bf picked a Caribbean place) my bf\u2019s brother (24M) and his bf both picked the same Korean bbq place. His brother picked it near the beginning and he and his bf loved it so much his bf picked the place again on the second to last night. Both nights I barely ate anything and people noticed but I told them I was fine.\n\nMy night was the last night and I wanted to pick a seafood place. My bf tried to get me to change my mind bc his brother\u2019s bf is allergic to shellfish, and the place I picked couldn\u2019t guarantee no cross contamination. He suggested going back to the Caribbean place since they did some seafood but had other options and could guarantee no cross contamination (he had called and asked without asking me). I was adamant I wanted to go there. I had put up with two nights of not eating and awful smells bc I was looking forward to this place. If I had to put up with that they could put up with this.\n\nIn the end we went to the seafood place, his brother\u2019s bf tried to find something on the menu but didn\u2019t order anything bc it might not be safe. His brother also didn\u2019t order anything and said he and his bf would go out somewhere else after we had finished here. The food was lovely but the atmosphere was kinda awkward but I didn\u2019t really care, I got my food. \n\nWe finished there and his brother and his brother\u2019s bf went to eat somewhere else and the rest of us went back to the hotel. My bf was being a bit cold so I asked him what was wrong. And he started having a go at me, telling me that I had been selfish and that I should have picked somewhere else. I told him that we went to places I didn\u2019t want to eat at and that I didn\u2019t complain. He said this was different. This wasn\u2019t someone not liking something, this was an allergy that could kill someone. I told him he was being over dramatic and went to bed.\n\nThe trip back was awkward and the past few days he\u2019s been short with me. I didn\u2019t think I did anything wrong, we all had to put up with other\u2019s choices and this was the same. But I can\u2019t stand this tension so maybe I should just apologise. And yeah they went back to the same Korean restaurant.

His family went on a small vacation recently and invited both of their son\u2019s partners (their younger sister isn\u2019t in a relationship so was allowed to bring a friend).\n\nTheir parents decided it would be fun if each night a different person got to pick where we went for dinner, that also worked out since we would be there for 7 nights and there was 8 of us (my bf\u2019s parents picked together instead of separately)\n\nThe problem comes with the fact that I don\u2019t like Asian food. I don\u2019t like how it smells and I find a lot of it tastes weird or too strong. While most people picked normal places (his parents picked an Italian place and his sister, picked a Mexican place, her friend picked a local restaurant (so normal food) and my bf picked a Caribbean place) my bf\u2019s brother (24M) and his bf both picked the same Korean bbq place. His brother picked it near the beginning and he and his bf loved it so much his bf picked the place again on the second to last night. Both nights I barely ate anything and people noticed but I told them I was fine.\n\nMy night was the last night and I wanted to pick a seafood place. My bf tried to get me to change my mind bc his brother\u2019s bf is allergic to shellfish, and the place I picked couldn\u2019t guarantee no cross contamination. He suggested going back to the Caribbean place since they did some seafood but had other options and could guarantee no cross contamination (he had called and asked without asking me). I was adamant I wanted to go there. I had put up with two nights of not eating and awful smells bc I was looking forward to this place. If I had to put up with that they could put up with this.\n\nIn the end we went to the seafood place, his brother\u2019s bf tried to find something on the menu but didn\u2019t order anything bc it might not be safe. His brother also didn\u2019t order anything and said he and his bf would go out somewhere else after we had finished here. The food was lovely but the atmosphere was kinda awkward but I didn\u2019t really care, I got my food. \n\nWe finished there and his brother and his brother\u2019s bf went to eat somewhere else and the rest of us went back to the hotel. My bf was being a bit cold so I asked him what was wrong. And he started having a go at me, telling me that I had been selfish and that I should have picked somewhere else. I told him that we went to places I didn\u2019t want to eat at and that I didn\u2019t complain. He said this was different. This wasn\u2019t someone not liking something, this was an allergy that could kill someone. I told him he was being over dramatic and went to bed.\n\nThe trip back was awkward and the past few days he\u2019s been short with me. I didn\u2019t think I did anything wrong, we all had to put up with other\u2019s choices and this was the same. But I can\u2019t stand this tension so maybe I should just apologise. And yeah they went back to the same Korean restaurant. So AIAT?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Do you really not like all Asian food?", "YTA, because you finding a certain cuisine \"weird\" and writing off the whole menu because of it is absolutely not the same thing as not being able to eat as an allergy. The way you described the food told me everything I needed to know. You won't die from eating at the Korean restaurant but he could die ordering at the place you picked. \n\nI understand food and sensory sensitivities, I have autism. Doesn't give you the right to be a massive prick about food from another culture that you have a clear bias about. I'm also white and uncultured with a shelfish allergy and I don't get how you can't see where you went wrong.", "Hi, OP. Honestly, I had written a different response initially but used my backspace button a lot. I truly hope you understand why so many people are unhappy with the \"normal\" comments, and I see you've tried to explain yourself. It doesn't quite pan out IMO but I'm not going to go there for now.\n\nWhile it's true that you sat at the Korean restaurant without complaint, your insistence in everyone going to the seafood place was your substitute \"complaint.\" Does that make sense? Your argument would have been more valid if you remained unaffected and continued to not make a fuss thereafter. \n\nBut you decided on your own that you were entitled to this food, in spite of the young man's allergy. Your logic that you sat through the Korean restaurant so therefore this guy must sit through the seafood restaurant is faulty, because him having a possible life threatening allergy is not the same as you not liking the smell and taste of Korean food. \n\nYou seem to think that you should have been rewarded for choosing not to eat, during which times people asked you if you were okay, and you said you were fine. By subsequently choosing an unsuitable restaurant, you backtracked and showed everyone that you were not actually fine. \n\nYou also point out that your BF had called the restaurant without \"asking\" you. He was looking out for his brother's BF, because you weren't. \n\nSee, the thing with having a big family (even if it's your BF's family) is that we sometimes make concessions for the sake of others. We do things that make sense for the group. Yes, I know, you suffered by having to sit in a Korean restaurant and you likely consider that unfair. You were keeping track of imaginary points. \n\nSometimes life is unfair, and it's often more unfair to people who are so self-absorbed that they overlook the obvious. \n\nHey, I was a picky eater when I was young. I sat through a lot of meals as an adult even. I'm asian-american and love other Asian cultures and food, but growing up there were a few foods my parents ate that I couldn't stand the sight or smell of. Point is, instead of sitting there with an empty plate, you find something to nibble on, even bread, dessert, coffee, rice. Your BF was being sweet by trying to satisfy you and not endanger his brother's BF. \n\nSide note, my siblings and I are planning a get together soon, as we're all grown with grown kids. The first thing that my sister wanted to be reminded of is what everyone's allergies are. This is because as a family, we take care of each other. Just some \"food\" for thought. YTA.", "YTA - so, instead of saying you didn't like Korean BBQ the first time you went, when asked, you said you\nwere fine. You could have expressed at that time that you did not like the food. Then the boyfriend's brother may have selected something different his night\n\nIt feels like you chose the seafood place, not only because you wanted to go there, but also to flex your power, and reaffirm it was your turn to choose the dinner. It seems it was a \"you went somewhere I didn't want to eat, so now you have to go somewhere you cannot eat\" - was it revenge? \n\nCompromise would have cost you nothing, and you could have been the bigger person. \n\nI'm also a little concerned that the rest of the family, knowing the allergy, still abided your pick. They should have all stood up for the bf to protect his well being and to show someone's health matters more to them than \"fairness\" in restaurant choice. \n\nAn allergy is, as others have mentioned, very different from not liking a food type. One means that maybe you have limited selection, the other means you could have a medical emergency on your hands.", "Major YTA. \u201cNormal food?\u201d Wow.

Your boyfriend's brother's boyfriend COULDN'T make a choice because anything on the menu was a risk to his health. You knew this from the get-go, and didn't care. Also, you were there for 6 or 7 days, surely you and your bf could have snuck away for lunch if it was so important to you. \n\nI'm going to say, though you are absolutely TA, and it's unbelievable someone your age doesn't realize that, it's really an ESH situation, because your boyfriend and his brother should have flat-out refused to go, and put anyone  else's health at risk just to please your highness.\n\nI hope you learn a valuable lesson in empathy and maturity, and do better with your next boyfriend.", "This is surely fake???

All it takes is the tiniest speck of liquid or shell to touch what he orders to kill him. A seafood restaurant cannot guarantee any food to not be exposed to shellfish. You were selfish because you knew this man had an allergy and wouldn't be able to eat food there but yet you didn't care because all you can focus on is that he chose a restaurant that served food you didn't like.

Anyone have good beginner level dishes?", "That's the thing it's not like Mexicans don't have preferences too if you don't want beans just say no beans nobody will think you're weird.", "I'm from Orange County and mi familia is from Tijuana so I felt this comment in my bones.", "I had buffalo curry on frybread on mine and I don't care how many cultures mixed to make it I think they are the new heaven on earth", "Dang. The second people hear my accent I get a listed accounting of their knowledge of Mexico including their cuisine preferences. Either that or I get asked for cocaine.", "That's fair \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Idk, I\u2019m allergic to soy and if I eat soy sauce I get rash and intense puking", "Asian Kitchen in Durham.", "Yup.  But... I am very fond of Korean food, BBQ and otherwise.\nCaribbean food is something I'm much less enthusiastic about, so I admit some personal bias.", "Bulgogi is one of my favorite dishes from Korean restaurants. And I love kimchi!", "kbbq ANYTHING is to die forrrrr.", "Literally just said to myself that Korean Fried Chicken is one of the best things in the world. So delicious.", "Cuz she decided in her head that\u201dAsian\u201d food is icky.", "Oh, yes! There's a Peruvian/Chinese fusion place near me that is just heavenly!", "That name is amazing, omg", "Yes. Yes. Join us, my child. \n\nLike not physically, this place is a fucking shit show. But eat our fooooooddddd.\n\nHere's a recipe for [Southern style biscuits ](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-southern-biscuits-237815) in case y'all don't have frozen.", "o.m.g.  I am in soooo much trouble. Cardamom tres leches??? Yes please, I'll have two. And at least one of everything else. This is amazing. My mouth is having a party just thinking about it all. \n\nI don't know if your a friend or an enemy by sharing this lol, but I appreciate you either way. Thank you!!!! \n\nRestaurants that serve this need to be in every town.", "Clearly you've never eaten a turkey dinosaur \ud83d\ude02", "> I can't believe the rest of the group actually went along with it!\n\nI was wondering about that part, too. How did the parents not say \"X is allergic. Pick something else\"?", "I never thought I would ever be spending more than a few hours of partying down in Tijuana but I absolutely love it. I have learned how to adapt to many things that I would have never thought possible. I have been here for 6 months and my Spanish is limited to basic phrases. I am trying to learn the language but for some reason it's failing me", "Really? I don\u2019t even know what a Mexican accent sounds like \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAlso, how rude of people to ask you for drugs!! How do you even answer that", "I would give a limb to learn how they make it so fkn crispy even after it's be ion the fridge for, let's be real, a few hours, cause damn it's good. I wish my stomach was larger.\n\nThe cheese powder ones.....", "When we can afford to go (students lmao) I often go \"I know this meal has enough cream and butter to kill me but tell St Peter after this meal I'll be ready to go!\" \ud83d\ude02 it's better than it sounds, even. They mix the spices a perfectly in a way where your shoulders slump and you fall into a half-lidded bliss.\n\nEdit: like the hint of cinnamon on the buffalo. Genius.", "I've been speaking both from birth and I still fuck up the damn prefixes on verbs when I switch from English to Spanish. Or I'll say nouns before adjectives when I switch back. You're trying and if I know Tijuana, that's perfectly fine. It'll help us practice some English too. We both win.\n\nI miss the shopping there ngl. My dad couldn't understand why I made him send me a pile of blankets from there \"but they're like $5?? Why do you want $5 blankets??\"\n\nThat's why dad!", "I live in Australia so they don't pronounce their rs while I pronounce mine double time. \ud83d\ude02\n\nIts wild I just kinda... Stare blankly. No lie I kinda base all future interactions with folk based on their reaction to me being Mexican. There's 3 types:\n1. The well-meaning kind person who is excited but in their ignorance blurt me random facts about my own country. I reply by doing the same. This person is usually a good person so I don't mind them. They're just excited and want to share.\n2. The outright racist who decides to call me a \"jumping bean\" (I'm hyper) or who, for some reason and I don't know why, starts doing an impression of a Mexican dancer but like... I don't know. I usually mark these folk as ones to avoid at all costs. I don't know why so many folk choose to dance at me while saying \"Arriba\" I don't fucking know. But it's regular enough it's on my list. These are also the cocaine askers. \n3. The person who is genuinely interested but is terrible at asking questions. My fave of this one was \"don't you think it's a funny your ancestors didn't know waat the sun was?\" this person I clock 50/50 and their reply to my next response is if I decide their okay or not. If they can handle me making jokes about them not understanding \"child in what world did you get the idea Aztecs don't know what the sun is?\" then they're OK. If they get defensive and go \"you know what I meant!\" then I tend to avoid them. I like the folk who can roll with me. We ALL say stupid shit it's how you pick yourself back up.\n\nSorry to make a huge reply. Just living in Australia my accent is more pronounced here and I get very common reactions.\n\nI think my fave was watching a bunch of guys do lines and then tell me I'd know where to get cocaine like sir I think you know more than I do.", "I believe it is double fried. A home cook I follow on social media EmmyMade, made it in one of her videos and from memory that was the trick.", "The non food shopping is incredible here but the food shopping..  That is why I cross over every 4 to 5 days to do some food shopping. \n\nI have nothing but mad respect for those who can flawlessly shift from Spanish to English and back again. I always loved that. Anyone that can speak and write in more than one language is incredibly smart. I have book smarts but for some reason there is a barrier there when I try to learn another language. I left almost in tears the other day because the local aborrotes owner had to repeat to me how much my total was. For some reason I couldn't translate the simple number from Spanish to English. I felt bad because he didn't have to speak English to me, I was just too stupid to figure it out. Now when I go in there he speaks a little English to me but I never expected it. My boyfriend is bilingual but he wasn't home that day.", "Are people just more racist in Australia? I\u2019m from NYC and being Mexican is not usually something to comment on"]}
