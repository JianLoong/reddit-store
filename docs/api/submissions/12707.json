His family went on a small vacation recently and invited both of their son\u2019s partners (their younger sister isn\u2019t in a relationship so was allowed to bring a friend).\n\nTheir parents decided it would be fun if each night a different person got to pick where we went for dinner, that also worked out since we would be there for 7 nights and there was 8 of us (my bf\u2019s parents picked together instead of separately)\n\nThe problem comes with the fact that I don\u2019t like Asian food. I don\u2019t like how it smells and I find a lot of it tastes weird or too strong. While most people picked normal places (his parents picked an Italian place and his sister, picked a Mexican place, her friend picked a local restaurant (so normal food) and my bf picked a Caribbean place) my bf\u2019s brother (24M) and his bf both picked the same Korean bbq place. His brother picked it near the beginning and he and his bf loved it so much his bf picked the place again on the second to last night. Both nights I barely ate anything and people noticed but I told them I was fine.\n\nMy night was the last night and I wanted to pick a seafood place. My bf tried to get me to change my mind bc his brother\u2019s bf is allergic to shellfish, and the place I picked couldn\u2019t guarantee no cross contamination. He suggested going back to the Caribbean place since they did some seafood but had other options and could guarantee no cross contamination (he had called and asked without asking me). I was adamant I wanted to go there. I had put up with two nights of not eating and awful smells bc I was looking forward to this place. If I had to put up with that they could put up with this.\n\nIn the end we went to the seafood place, his brother\u2019s bf tried to find something on the menu but didn\u2019t order anything bc it might not be safe. His brother also didn\u2019t order anything and said he and his bf would go out somewhere else after we had finished here. The food was lovely but the atmosphere was kinda awkward but I didn\u2019t really care, I got my food. \n\nWe finished there and his brother and his brother\u2019s bf went to eat somewhere else and the rest of us went back to the hotel. My bf was being a bit cold so I asked him what was wrong. And he started having a go at me, telling me that I had been selfish and that I should have picked somewhere else. I told him that we went to places I didn\u2019t want to eat at and that I didn\u2019t complain. He said this was different. This wasn\u2019t someone not liking something, this was an allergy that could kill someone. I told him he was being over dramatic and went to bed.\n\nThe trip back was awkward and the past few days he\u2019s been short with me. I didn\u2019t think I did anything wrong, we all had to put up with other\u2019s choices and this was the same. But I can\u2019t stand this tension so maybe I should just apologise. And yeah they went back to the same Korean restaurant.

His family went on a small vacation recently and invited both of their son\u2019s partners (their younger sister isn\u2019t in a relationship so was allowed to bring a friend).\n\nTheir parents decided it would be fun if each night a different person got to pick where we went for dinner, that also worked out since we would be there for 7 nights and there was 8 of us (my bf\u2019s parents picked together instead of separately)\n\nThe problem comes with the fact that I don\u2019t like Asian food. I don\u2019t like how it smells and I find a lot of it tastes weird or too strong. While most people picked normal places (his parents picked an Italian place and his sister, picked a Mexican place, her friend picked a local restaurant (so normal food) and my bf picked a Caribbean place) my bf\u2019s brother (24M) and his bf both picked the same Korean bbq place. His brother picked it near the beginning and he and his bf loved it so much his bf picked the place again on the second to last night. Both nights I barely ate anything and people noticed but I told them I was fine.\n\nMy night was the last night and I wanted to pick a seafood place. My bf tried to get me to change my mind bc his brother\u2019s bf is allergic to shellfish, and the place I picked couldn\u2019t guarantee no cross contamination. He suggested going back to the Caribbean place since they did some seafood but had other options and could guarantee no cross contamination (he had called and asked without asking me). I was adamant I wanted to go there. I had put up with two nights of not eating and awful smells bc I was looking forward to this place. If I had to put up with that they could put up with this.\n\nIn the end we went to the seafood place, his brother\u2019s bf tried to find something on the menu but didn\u2019t order anything bc it might not be safe. His brother also didn\u2019t order anything and said he and his bf would go out somewhere else after we had finished here. The food was lovely but the atmosphere was kinda awkward but I didn\u2019t really care, I got my food. \n\nWe finished there and his brother and his brother\u2019s bf went to eat somewhere else and the rest of us went back to the hotel. My bf was being a bit cold so I asked him what was wrong. And he started having a go at me, telling me that I had been selfish and that I should have picked somewhere else. I told him that we went to places I didn\u2019t want to eat at and that I didn\u2019t complain. He said this was different. This wasn\u2019t someone not liking something, this was an allergy that could kill someone. I told him he was being over dramatic and went to bed.\n\nThe trip back was awkward and the past few days he\u2019s been short with me. I didn\u2019t think I did anything wrong, we all had to put up with other\u2019s choices and this was the same. But I can\u2019t stand this tension so maybe I should just apologise. And yeah they went back to the same Korean restaurant. So AIAT?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
