Our mother (47F) was never supportive and never helped her, and she even disowned my sister when was she was 18 years old because she didn't want to 'deal with her' anymore. Our parents are divorced so my sister moved away to be closer to our dad (52M) when that happened.

I'm NC with my mom and her family who are equally as horrible as she is, so we kept the funeral off social media and my mom didn't find out. During the two years between the disowning and the funeral, my mom never spoke to my sister once, or asked me about her. My dad told me that it was my decision on whether or not to tell her, and I decided not to because she never supported my sister at all.

My mother was abusive towards my sister and my stepdad was too, but loads of people are telling me that I was totally wrong for what I've done and that my mother deserved to know regardless of what's happened. My dad and his family are saying that I was right but something about hearing that my mother fainted is making me feel awful. My boyfriend (29M) said what I did was an asshole move and now I've caused my mother unimaginable pain. We got into an argument and he said that as a mother, my mom deserved to know.

Your mom would\u2019ve made a terrible situation so much worse for you, and it wouldn\u2019t have been worth the stress and pain. You have enough pain in losing your sister. \n\nMy mom was mentally and emotionally abusive when I was a kid. When she split up from my dad, just about every conversation included how horrible he was (he was battling alcoholism and depression; he wasn\u2019t abusive). When he suddenly died from a heart attack in 2008, everything was on me to take care of his body and his apartment because I\u2019m an only child (my grandparents were alive but they were mourning their child and lived out of state), so my mom offered to fly to where he lived to support me. I thought she would watch my son while I got things done, but instead volunteered to help me at the apartment. Things seemed okay, but then I made the mistake of mentioning how my grandparents were going to give me my dad\u2019s inheritance, which was a good amount. I immediately said I wanted to pay my mom for the last minute plane ticket she\u2019d had to buy and things still seemed okay. After a days I had to leave to take my dad\u2019s ashes to his service near my grandparents and my mom volunteered to finish the apartment, and I was so grateful. \n\nFast forward two weeks and I finally get home. I\u2019d been on the road 15+ hours that day but called her immediately to check in, and she preceded to yell at me for reporting my dad\u2019s death to Veteran\u2019s Affairs because was retired military and got a pension. Half went to her because of the divorce, and she was pissed she wouldn\u2019t get it anymore so she\u2019ll yelled until I dissolved into tears. She had also *sent a bill to my mourning grandparents* for helping me with my dad\u2019s apartment, something she had *volunteered* to do and despite the fact I was planning on paying her back. (I didn\u2019t pay her back after that shit.) \n\nIt devolved from there (including her acting like my dad\u2019s widow \ud83d\ude44), and in 2014 I completely cut her out for good. All this written to show that assholes are still assholes after someone dies. It made mourning for my dad so much harder and stressful, and I got so stressed out my left arm gave out (I literally couldn\u2019t raise my arm straight up in the air. It eventually was fine, but I had a bunch of tests including a MRI done and nothing was found). \n\nSo I wholeheartedly think you did the absolute right thing in not involving her.

It went down horribly and according to my stepdad, my mother fainted and was inconsolable. I've now been receiving phonecalls from all of her family who are extremely furious with me. My dad and members of his family too are being contacted on social media. \n\nNow, I'm feeling like total shit. My mother was abusive towards my sister and my stepdad was too, but loads of people are telling me that I was totally wrong for what I've done and that my mother deserved to know regardless of what's happened. My dad and his family are saying that I was right but something about hearing that my mother fainted is making me feel awful. My boyfriend (29M) said what I did was an asshole move and now I've caused my mother unimaginable pain. We got into an argument and he said that as a mother, my mom deserved to know.

She heard something terrible, her blood pressure bottomed out, her brain went \"Whoops-a-do, where's the oxygen?\",  she hit the floor, her blood pressure went back to normal and she came out of it.\n\nIt is not dangerous over the long-term, or even the short term, other than the probability of bruises; so long as she didn't hit her head or fall on a glass, it's about as dangerous as stubbing a toe.\n\nI faint regularly, due to a gene disorder which causes vascular problems. Hundreds of times in the last twenty years.

It is absolutely dangerous as you can't predict when or where it happens. What if you're behind the wheel driving? What if you're in the shower? What if you're asleep? \n\nA friend of mine died from fainting in the shower. She didn't hit her head or anything, but bit her tongue while she was out, and choked on it. Seizures and fainting absolutely *can* be dangerous and a serious concern.\n\nI myself have epilepsy without the mainstream \"convulsions\" type seizures, I just go down. Basically just faint. The amount of times I've fallen the \"wrong way\" and hurt myself is insane, I lost count. I don't get more than 5 seconds of an aura before I faint as a signal that it's gonna happen. Usually if I'm at home, it's enough time to sit down on the floor. That's about it. Imagine I'm alone in a grocery store, or crossing the road.

Now your sister is gone, she can\u2019t swan in and gaslight you both into thinking she didn\u2019t really mean it and start performing the dutiful mother role for her audience. She can\u2019t even publicly perform now as the grieving mother, because who is going to believe she gave a shit because she disowned your sister.

I have done things like that myself, I have waited and set someone up, not quite to this level, but pretty hurtful because I \"knew\" they deserved it. In the cold light of reflection, I was the asshole in every one of those cases. It was something to learn from. \n\nSo to me your central question in AITA is this, and only you can answer:\n\nWhen she called and you did not hang up, did you know that she was going to ask about your sister? Did you cause the pain to her because you wanted to cause pain for the pain you and your sister had suffered because of her? Only you can answer that question. \n\nI have had to tell people that their family members had died, some estranged, some not. I consider it a kindness to tell them on first contact; \"I have some really bad news for you...\"  \n\n\nI voted ESH and am getting my karma points trashed because of it. The question is, was your not hanging up and dumping a daughters death on a mother, no matter how much of a asshole she was, mean you did something that was asshole behavior?  \n\n\nYou don't owe us anything here, I ask my question so you can ask the man in the mirror.", "I think OP's boyfriend is too focused on \"decency\" to understand just how bad Asshole Mom has to be to be denied even the funeral. \n\nAnd I am very concerned the boyfriend thinks this is an asshole move when he should know better to be more supportive of OP and his late sister's wishes.", "Litteraly bullied her own child for 18 years and the first time in her life she cared was when she could claim grieving SMH incubator is KIND", "That is not true. People have drug addicts in their family or people with mental illness who leave and the family still grieves when they die.

Or maybe it's something completely different. Couples counseling and individual counseling for each of you could only help. It sounds like you both have some trauma and counseling can help.

Based on my personal experience it can kinda be like going to the gym to get healthy - it\u2019s not a 100% altruistic goal because a tiny part of you does want to look good and have approval from other people. \n\nThat\u2019s how my therapist compared it when we talked about. He said that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m a bad person/ it\u2019s a bad thing to do or ruined or anything like that, it just needs to be acknowledged/understood so it doesn\u2019t cause distress\n\nIdk how OP feels because everyone\u2019s different, I\u2019m just offering up a unique perspective as someone who\u2019s been a similar (but not as severe) position. \n\nETA: Forgot to add the NTA", "The choice not to act was a choice. \n\n  \nA text after the funeral that said something like; \"I have some really bad news..\" Was not at all required, not expected, but would have been kind.

I get that.   \n\n\nThe aita part is that he picked up the call from his mom, ***and instead of hanging up continued the conversation knowing that she would ask about her daughter***.

Etc.\". Sure..... \n\nHowever sticking the sword in as far as you can and twisting it without any compassion on your part..... We know the mom was an asshole.
