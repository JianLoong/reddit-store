The fact that he\u2019s a lot older than you is not helping the optics either. Are you sure you want to go through with this wedding?", "NTA\n\nWith this age gap especially you need to stick up for yourself. Do not let this man control you and walk all over you.

What did you say when he shared his wish?\n\n(It\u2019s not his place to decide your bridesmaids and announce to them that \u2018you have something to ask them\u2019, but your answer determines how much of an AH he is.)", "Everybody says this but 22 is very young to get married, especially to someone already in his 30s.

PLEASE listen to what everyone is telling you and what take this for what it is- a big red flag. You\u2019re young and have years ahead of you to find someone who will love you and treat you with respect. This guy is manipulative and controlling. Is that what you want to live with until death do you part?", "Is it really his fault? He shouldn't have said that, but you didn't have to ask her any question, you could have declined. You could have asked anything else. You are responsible for what you say, nobody was making you say it, you made that choice and should take personal responsibility for your actions.

I married a woman TWELVE years younger and we've been married for 27 years and together for 36!  But, I don't treat her the way this guy does.", "This right here. If he wants her in the wedding then she can be on his side. He does NOT get to make that decision for you.

Not all age gap relationships are toxic, but it CAN be indicative of immaturity in the older partner and an unhealthy power dynamic. The reason age gaps are considered toxic here is more because most of the people here who are in age gap relationships have some glaring red flags in their post.  It\u2019s great that you have a healthy relationship, but that\u2019s why you\u2019re in the comments and not the OP!", "NTA. \n\nYou need to have a frank conversation with him. Let him know you absolutely did not appreciate him making that decision without you involved.  It\u2019s *your* bridesmaids. Not *his* bridesmaids. You have every right to want to stand up with people you love. \n\nNot that it particular matters, but to drive your point home - a lot of guys don\u2019t realize how involved bridesmaids are with the bride before a wedding. They often times are intimately included in many events - finding your dress, wedding shower, bachelorette party, getting you ready the day of the wedding. He just signed you up to be stuck with her for a lot of *your* special moments. This isn\u2019t just a, \u201cwell she will just be standing by you at the wedding\u201d type of thing.  This was a huge decision that he decided to make for you. \n\nIf he tries to say it isn\u2019t a big deal, use the above reason. Let him know if it isn\u2019t a big deal, then it shouldn\u2019t be an issue for you to pick one of his groomsmen for him.  \n\nThis is a deeper issue than just about bridesmaids - you need to set the tone for the rest of your relationship.  Going forward he should be discussing decisions involving you *with you*, not deciding *for you*.", "Now you know what kind of man ur marrying, do u still wanna continue this path???\n\n\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "ESH. He put you on the spot and for that, he is an AH but it sounds like he did it through excitement and not thinking, rather than maliciously knowing you didn't want her. \n\nYou also had other options rather than just asking her to be a bridesmaid. For example;\n\n- Yes, WE do have an important question to ask. Your brother would like you to be his best woman.\n- Sorry, I don't know what your brother is talking about, I'll call you back\n-  We would love you to do a reading at our wedding.\n\nYou need to put on your big girl pants, explain what he has done and then both of you need to tell his sister that unfortunately, her brother got over excited and you had already chosen your bridesmaids. Soften the blow by finding another role for her.", "Learn how to say no. And FYI he's a mistake.", "NTA. Also, he's way too old for you sweetie.", "INFO:  what are those reasons?  This is really vague and hard to tell if it\u2019s legit.\n\nIn general the asshole is the fiance.  22 and 31 is an uncomfortable age gap, and him forcing you into this is bad.  You have final say over your bridal party.\n\nThat being said, unless you have a pretty compelling reason you probably should have consented.  Vetoing his sister as a bridesmaid is something that\u2019s well within your rights, but it\u2019s also probably not something that happens very often to couples who are in a good enough space to get married.", "DO NOT MARRY THAT MAN.", "NTA - you need to have a conversation with him. if he does not listen and respect your feelings- run.", "Even if he took her silence as consent, it is STILL a very A H move to put someone on the spot like that."]}
