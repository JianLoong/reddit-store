You have every right to want to stand up with people you love. \n\nNot that it particular matters, but to drive your point home - a lot of guys don\u2019t realize how involved bridesmaids are with the bride before a wedding. They often times are intimately included in many events - finding your dress, wedding shower, bachelorette party, getting you ready the day of the wedding. He just signed you up to be stuck with her for a lot of *your* special moments. This isn\u2019t just a, \u201cwell she will just be standing by you at the wedding\u201d type of thing.  This was a huge decision that he decided to make for you. \n\nIf he tries to say it isn\u2019t a big deal, use the above reason.

Your brother would like you to be his best woman.\n- Sorry, I don't know what your brother is talking about, I'll call you back\n-  We would love you to do a reading at our wedding.\n\nYou need to put on your big girl pants, explain what he has done and then both of you need to tell his sister that unfortunately, her brother got over excited and you had already chosen your bridesmaids.

You have final say over your bridal party.\n\nThat being said, unless you have a pretty compelling reason you probably should have consented.

I'd also include some good friends in the bridal party to support you in this.\n\nJust editing to add that I don't understand all the freak out about the age difference, it's clearly not an issue for the OP and it's not part of the question she is asking.
