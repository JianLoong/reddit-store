{"id": 10312, "submission_id": "115s5nk", "title": "AITA for \"embarrassing\" my friend at her baby shower?", "selftext": "My friend \"Tiffany\"  is what I considered an ally. While she is straight and white, she always appeared to care about civil rights issues, posted about it on Facebook, talked to me about it in person, etc. She has always told me what a big deal this is because she was raised in a very conservative family. I am a lesbian, so knowing my friends are allies means a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTiffany is pregnant and today was her baby shower. However, I also love to give books at showers as I'm a huge advocate for child literacy. I bought a couple of classics and added in a book called \"Rainbow: A First Book of Pride\", which is a toddler book that just talks about what each color of the rainbow means and showcases what different families look like. I've given it at other showers before so I didn't see the big deal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe shower was held at our friend \"Marcia's\" house. Tiffany was opening her gifts and got to mine. Everything was fine until she opened up the rainbow one. She got really quiet and started looking around. A few of her relatives were giving weird looks. Her mom (who was sitting next to her) took it and made a face, saying the baby is \"too young for propaganda\". I was a little hurt and pointed out that some people had purchased the baby religious-themed toddler books as well. I don't have a problem with that, but was confused as to how one was okay and others weren't. Marcia quickly made sure Tiffany got the next gift. I assumed it was over. While it hurt and was weird in the moment, I didn't wish to harp on it. I don't like Tiffany's mother, we've had issues in the past with her making weird/judgemental comments towards me. I don't need her to like me and considering she doesn't live close by, I can maintain a relationship with Tiffany without us seeing each other.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I stayed behind to help clean up the shower. When I was taking the trash out, Tiffany followed me outside. She thanked me for the gifts but said I shouldn't have gone off registry with the books. I said I had a gift receipt if she wanted to exchange them. She said that wasn't the issue, but she knew what kind of people would be at the shower and I embarrassed her by bringing the book, as well as challenging her mother. I pointed out that her mother should be embarrassed for mocking a gift, as that hurt my feelings. Tiffany says I know what her mom is like and I brought unnecessary drama to the shower. I said that she is the one who followed me outside, I had let the issue drop and that I only bought the book as a genuine gift for her baby, something I assumed she and her husband would like. I pointed out several other people went off registry, were they getting chastised? Tiffany said no, but they didn't get her anything embarrassing. I got upset all over again, finished helping with the clean up but then left.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMarcia texted me later saying I have to understand where Tiffany is coming from, plus she's pregnant and hormonal. She told me to apologize for nearly ruining the shower. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Since some people are asking if I did this as some kind of stunt... \n\nI did not do it to create drama or make anyone uncomfortable. It seriously didn't cross my mind that this would be an issue. Because Tiffany herself has always appeared to be pro-LGBTQ+ rights, I didn't see the big deal. I figured it'd be a good book for an ally's library. I've always bought pro-LGBTQ+ children's books for baby showers and it's never been an issue. I wouldn't purposefully put any of my friends in an awkward situation.\n\n ", "created_utc": 1676755547, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115s5nk/aita_for_embarrassing_my_friend_at_her_baby_shower/", "score": 7208, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Lots of people go off registry at baby and wedding showers, especially when they\u2019re close to the recipients. The issue was that Tiffany is unwilling to have an uncomfortable conversation with her mother. It\u2019s her choice what kind of relationship she wants to have with her mom, but without that conversation her mother feels like everyone in the room agrees with her. This gives her free rein to make out like you\u2019re the problem. These people won\u2019t change, and perhaps more importantly, Tiffany will never defend you to her mother.\n\nEdit: Don\u2019t apologize. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. \n\nTiffany is *not* an ally.\nI'm sorry you found out this way.", "NTA She called your gift embarrassing - I would love to know her reasoning why she thinks she can say that and still call herself an ally. A true ally would have been angry about her mom's treatment of her friend. I'm sorry you had to learn this about an alleged friend, but it's also a good thing you now know she only wants credit for being an ally and to appear like an ally and doesn't genuinely see you as her equal.", "NTA. But your friend and her mom are. Why didn't anyone defend your gift?\nI understand you're hurt. But being gay and asking for some parenting on diversity is not an AH move.\nPeople become strange idiots when they have kids.\n\nMaybe her mom is pushing to end your friendship, \"for the sake of the baby\". Nobody knows.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, imho.", "NTA and she\u2019s not an ally.", "NTA\n\nLook I'm not going to say Tiffany is not an ally for not wanting to fight with her mom at her baby shower, it's hard to put your foot down against family sometimes and some people truly struggle with it. \nBut I will say she's a hypocrite for going after you when you did the same as others. You bought something that while off the registry you thought she'd like.\n\nYou didn't buy anything \"embarrassing\", why would she be embarrassed over the ideas she allegedly shares?\n\nHonestly I would distance myself, don't reach out unless she does first. And tbh if she will not only not defend you but berate you for this I believe you should tell her that you want to step back from your friendship as you can no longer trust her. I sure wouldn't, I would never feel comfortable discussing this issues with her if she only thinks like this when it's convenient for her.\n\nALSO her mom was the one making sarky remarks, she could've just stayed quiet and not made a scene at the shower", "All the comments here are coming down to two types of people: those who think LGBTQ+ should be allowed to live visible lives, and those who are \"tolerant allies\" as long as they don't have to see it. Your friend is one of the latter. \n\nThere's no reason for it to have been given privately. There's no reason for you to apologize.", "I'm going with NTA. You bought something you thought she'd appreciate and she didn't. She's the one embarrassed by her family knowing that someone is *gasp* not straight.\nPs I desperately despise it when people get bent because you didn't buy specific items from a registry.  Ugh.", "NTA and she\u2019s a pretty crappy ally if she would call that embarrassing. What the fuck to anyone who would say otherwise.", "NTA.  I\u2019m an ally and my parents, friends and coworkers know it.  Her friends and family do not.

I was just a kids book ffs.\n\nLGBTQ+ people exist, different kind of families exist and they kid will for sure met them in real life, is not better foto everyone that the family talk them about it before hand? Regardless of your views on the matter pretend that everyone is hetero is foolish.", "NTA\n\nTiffany and Marcia need to work on themselves. One queer woman to another, these folks are not doing their work as allies.

I can\u2019t wait to share this with baby!\u2019\n\nNobody should ever ask you to apologize for being out and proud and trusting them to be the allies they say they are.

Your intent was good. It's unfortunate that people were  uncomfortable and more unfortunate that they spoke up about it when it wasn't their shower. It's not your job to make everyone around you comfortable at all times. It's an impossible task anyways. Tiffany wants everyone to be happy, but she's an adult and she shouldn't worry about it. It's not your job to apologize to Tiffany. It's Tiffany's job to set boundaries with her family.", "NTA.\n\nMy parents have some different views of mine and I don't let them dictate my taste and opinion publicly.

This is a wonderful book for a parent who really wants to educate their child in this world. Seems like your \u201cfriend\u201d is posing as an ally online and with you but probably hiding these posts from her mother and others on FB. She wanted to have it both ways and it all came crushing down at her baby shower. You don\u2019t need to support her hypocrisy.", "NTA.  Hopefully Tiffany will learn to stand up to others despite who they are to her sooner rather than later, especially since she has a child on the way and standing up for what\u2019s right is one of the most important lessons you can teach a child.

She\u2019s not really an ally if she\u2019s not willing to call her family out on their homophobia.", "NTA fk bowing to bigots. It\u2019s a book ffs. Religious books are sexist, bigoted propaganda.  Tiffany is a chameleon, she\u2019s whoever she\u2019s around. Those people aren\u2019t allies.", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't want it to be a big deal, but Tiffany (and her mother) made it one. Her being pregnant and hormonal has nothing to do with having a double life of \"ally\" and \"bigoted\". Having a non-Christian family isn't \"propaganda\" as Tiffany's mother called it.", "NTA\n\nI'm really sorry your friend didn't stand up for you. I get that the mother has weird or outdated views on the world, but I wouldn't let my mother chastise a friend of mine who means nothing but well. I understand that maybe at a baby shower you don't want to have any kind of drama or arguments, but some things are worth arguing about and I wouldn't want to have a friend hurt.", "NTA", "NTA. What a wonderful and thoughtful gift. It shows that you believe in Tiffany\u2019s ability to be the sort of mother who teaches her children acceptance.\n\nIt saddens me that Tiffany called the gift embarrassing. Why isn\u2019t she embarrassed at her mother for calling the contents of that book \u201cpropaganda\u201d? I\u2019d be deeply embarrassed, not to mention furious, if my mother said that.", "NTA.

She\u2019ll say shit like \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the white woman alone at night \u201c instead of just saying woman etc. all of us call her out EVERY SINGLE TIME and the conversation isn\u2019t over until she understands what was wrong with what she said. \nAllies are supposed to educate their prejudiced family members, not try to keep the damn peace with them.", "NTA. Tiffany sounds like a damn fraud. I can\u2019t stand that shit. Stand by your convictions or keep your mouth shut. She pretended to be a social-justice minded person yet she\u2019s catering to her bigoted family\u2019s feelings. I just don\u2019t play games like that and I would have kicked my mom out and anybody else who made a comment. A true ally makes it clear that behavior like that is unacceptable. \n\nTiffany is not an ally. Tiffany is likely a narcissistic who likes to have the world view her as some straight, white savior while she holes up with the bigots in her off-time. \n\nNow, if Tiffany didn\u2019t make a big stink about how woke she is all the time and you gave her the book, I can say as a queer person that it would seem a bit agenda-pushing.

She is not an ally, she clearly does not understand what it is to be an ally and she is invested in facilitating bigotry rather than standing up to it.\n\nYou got a book for her child based on the value system she had repeatedly communicated she believed in. Others went off registry, yet you were the only one targeted, so clearly the registry is not the issue. Her mother also publicly snubbed you and your gift, as your friend\u2019s guest, that was out of line. The fact your friend enabled her mother\u2019s offense is incredibly telling of who she really is. Homophobia aside, this was disrespectful and poor hosting. \n\nYou could try finding resources that explain situations like these, or detail what an ally is, to send to her. You could also just have a heart to heart with her explaining the behavior and how she betrayed you when she had an opportunity to step up as the ally she said she was. Otherwise, it may be time for you to reconsider the friendship.", "NTA. She\u2019s an ally unless she has to stand up to her own bigoted family. So she\u2019s an ally as long as she doesn\u2019t have to do anything. Not really an ally.  How were you supposed to know she was actually a coward?", "NTA. There\u2019s a difference in being an ally and saying you support something you refuse to openly stand up for. As a straight white woman I use every opportunity to try to stop bigotry and judgmental people, even if they are family. You\u2019re never to old to learn how to be decent human being. I tell that to my racist grandpa often. I refuse to let him misgender or use any kind of slurs. He is progressing nicely if I say so myself.", "You are NTA.  I\u2019m sorry your friend was so insensitive.", "NTA if those people are offended by something like this then GOOD. Make them uncomfortable. Sorry your friend is not the Ally you thought she was.", "NTA. I'm a straight white ally with family members who aren't. I don't associate with them regularly but they may be invited to a significant event. Anyone who follows me on social media knows my stance, and I've never made it secret if it's brought up in social settings. I'd much rather a book like this, than a religious one, but that may be because I'm an atheist. I'm not sure she's much of am ally if this kind of gift would embarrass/upset her. I wouldn't even be upset by a religious book, as it's the thought that counts.\n\nYWBTA if this were a stunt, but as your edit explicitly states it wasn't, and I'm inclined to believe you, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. She\u2019s not an ally. I have seen those types of baby books and they are becoming more and more popular. It\u2019s not propaganda, it\u2019s just showing what actual families look like. You ruined nothing. They made a big deal out of a baby book.", "NTA.\n\nIf she didn't like the book, she should have smiled, said thank you, and put it away somewhere. That's what real allies do.", "NTA. Your friend is walking a line that she probably hates. She is trying to keep a relationship with some of her family while supporting her friends. It\u2019s not always easy to walk away from family who have differing beliefs and that\u2019s probably where she lives. She may not have the ability to be angry with them because of who they are in her life so she\u2019s angry at the person she can trust. Plus she\u2019s pregnant. Give her a few days. Take her out for lunch and give her an opportunity to talk. Just remember her hormones are a little crazy at the moment.", "Commenting again to say; let this friendship die on this bill if need be. You are the person owed an apology here", "NTA for sure. These people suck. Just because it\u2019s thorny, difficult work to create boundaries with her mother thus ensuring an inclusive, respectful, bigotry-free space in her own damn house, doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t necessary for her to do that work, particularly if she wants to be known as an ally. Give me a break. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you had endure that toxicity, that you had to learn the disappointing truth about Tiffany, and that now you have to read all the nonsensical Y T A\u2019s in here from a bunch of other Tiffanys that are just telling on themselves.", "Soft YTA. I really do understand where you\u2019re coming from.

I'll give you a pass though since it seems as though you were genuinely unaware that this could cause issues.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry you were\nTreated so poorly", "So what all the Y T A people are saying is that THEY aren\u2019t homophobic, BUT homophobia is okay. As long as you don\u2019t start DRAMA.

I honestly think you handled yourself very well in the moment, despite the obvious bigotry from your friend\u2019s mom. I\u2019m not sure why she chose to corner you outside, especially as you mentioned you had dropped it despite your understandably hurt feelings. \n\nThere\u2019s something to be said about pregnancy hormones so maybe it\u2019s worth giving your friend a pass, but still NTA.", "NTA.  You found a hypocrite", "NTA - we have that book and love it. She is clearly not a friend and this was clearly not a stunt on your part. It\u2019s a perfectly viable book. No one blinked when I got that book at my shower alongside the religious books from my conservative side of the female. The problem is her family", "NTA and it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s really an ally. An ally would have smiled and thanked you for the book and shut down any family drama.", "NTA. If she's only an ally when bigots aren't looking, then she's not an ally.", "NTA", "NTA and the people saying YTA are either not reading the full post or are also in the same boat as your friends mom and are bigots. \n\nFrom the post we can assume you and Tiffany are very close and a time may come where Tiffany\u2019s child asks how come you and your family are \u201cdifferent\u201d to Tiffany\u2019s and the book would have been a gentle way to explain it to the child. \n\nTiffany has however outed herself as a fake ally, saying the book is embarrassing and no one else\u2019s was when they were pushing their religious beliefs etc. because for the most part who doesn\u2019t have family members on social media, so surely they see the stuff she posts about on there? \n\nAgain. NTA and probably have a think about whether you want this friendship to continue now she\u2019s shown her true colours, have a sit down with her maybe and see why she said what she said to you after she\u2019s had the baby", "YTA because you knew what her mom was like and knew it would cause trouble.\n\nYou are in the right here, in general.  Closed minded judgementalism towards various lifestyles is wrong. \n\nBut. . so many of us were born into closed minded religion-based families, and despite not holding those views ourselves and doing everything we can to show support towards diversity in the world, are completely unable to have any kind of conversation about certain topics without things quickly devolving into a judgmental shouting match and long lasting tension.  We've TRIED. . we've gotten in all the fights many times. . and there's a giant wall there that cannot be breached.\n\nSo the real world choices are 1. abandon/lose the family 2. get in fights with family all the time over social issues or 3. avoid certain topics around certain family members.\n\nThis is going to get hit with downvotes and \"not an ally\" I'm sure, but this is just the reality of life for those of us unfortunate enough to be born into extremely conservative and religious families.  I think people in general need to be a bit more sensitive towards those caught in the middle of \"lose my family\" vs \"ignore certain issues around family\" and its something of an AH move to force social issues on family events for others.", "I can\u2019t decide. I feel like you were a little thoughtless. People have complicated relationships with family and I feel like you were inconsiderate in not anticipating this reception.  You say it never crossed your mind, but I feel that\u2019s the problem, it should have. \n\nNo doubt your friend has had to be very considerate of your feelings on numerous occasions, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask for the same effort.  I think YTA here. Slightly selfish and short-sighted of you.", "NTA. Your friend became the asshole when she followed you outside not to apologize for her mom but to chastise you. I'm sorry that happened.", "I'm going with an unpopular ESH\n\nA newborn doesn't listen to stories and grasp concepts. They listen to the sound and tone of their parent's voice.  And I read a stupid amount of books each year, so please know that is coming from an avid look lover and literacy proponent. But the gift seems more about you than a baby or what the parents of a newborn asked for on their registry. \n\nThe mother of your friend is a bigot, so obviously she sucks. \n\nYour friend also shouldn't have followed you outside and chastised you for your gift or your confrontation with her mother. \n\nThe bottom line is, you're significantly responsible for the situation. (You knew the family was full of bigots and how they might react, yet you chose to go off-registry and buy something sure to draw their (gross) disapproval.) \n\nYes, you also should be able to defend yourself when someone treats you badly, as her mother did. And she (your friend) did not defend you or ask her mother to stop, which also sucks. \n\nBut anyone could see how that gift would be received in that company. And you chose to create the likelihood of that happening during her baby shower. \n\nEdit to add what I hope was obvious- don't make other people's events all about you.\n\nThe second edit- thank you for the awards, kind strangers!", "NTA for giving the book. But kinda for giving it at the shower where you knew her Conservative relatives would be. It took the attention off of Tiffany and onto you & the book.", "YTA \n\nStop trying to make everything about you.

But bottom line is that she's not going to alienate her mom for being conservative. And that's a pretty common situation. \n\nIn this case you are the problem to her because you are the more dispensable party. You're a good friend, but her mom is her mom and she didn't want you arguing with her mom at what was supposed to be a fun event.", "NAH. Assuming you genuinely believed that the pride book wouldn't cause an issue with the relatives, it was a nice gift that shared something that is important to you. But I also can't entirely fault Tiffany for her reaction. She's certainly leading a double life, being (performatively?) \"woke\" online while catering to her family's homophobic views, but as a queer person myself with many conservative acquaintances I know that navigating these social situations is not as black and white as people like to think it is. That said, it's still horribly hypocritical that the religious books were fine but your pride book was not, and that Tiffany's being excused with the cranky and hormonal argument.", "This feels like you knew exactly how Tiffany\u2019s family would respond to your gift and you wanted to create an opportunity for her to prove her allyship to you. A baby shower is not the moment for this. Why would you do this to your friend? This was just unnecessarily rude. Buy a gift off the registry next time. YTA.", "I'm a little confused with my vote so it will be a soft ESH\nYou had already had problems with Tifanny's mom and without realizing it and I hope without bad intentions you and Tifanny's mom turned the baby shower into an awkward discussion about gender, religion and sexual preferences. They both made Tifanny uncomfortable, Marcia realized that and I feel like she's right. You should apologize. Not because of the book itself, in my opinion I feel that every gift is important and above all it is important to teach a child that there are different types of families and people to create adults with tolerance, inclusion and awareness. Now, I also think that Tifanny's mother should apologize for creating unnecessary drama, if she didn't like the gift it was enough to pretend and not say it. Regarding Tifanny, I don't think she is a false ally, at least in my country baby showers are in the last stages of pregnancy. She must be dealing with a lot of pressures in addition to physical and hormonal changes, maybe she just wanted something quiet that turned into a war camp. And I can understand that she doesn't want drama with her mother at this point, for some reason a lot of pregnant women take refuge in their mother at this stage. My advice is to keep giving away those books but not at baby showers if you know that the family is conservative and can create unnecessary drama and stress for the pregnant woman. Then do it privately, As I said before, I still consider it a good gift.", "I get where you\u2018re coming from but you\u2018re still the asshole. You knew about her family\u2018s beliefs and knew they would be there. You intentionally put Tiffany in a situation you knew or at least had to expect to be uncomfortable.

While she is straight and white, she always appeared to care about civil rights issues, posted about it on Facebook, talked to me about it in person, etc. She has always told me what a big deal this is because she was raised in a very conservative family. I am a lesbian, so knowing my friends are allies means a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTiffany is pregnant and today was her baby shower. However, I also love to give books at showers as I'm a huge advocate for child literacy. I bought a couple of classics and added in a book called \"Rainbow: A First Book of Pride\", which is a toddler book that just talks about what each color of the rainbow means and showcases what different families look like. I've given it at other showers before so I didn't see the big deal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe shower was held at our friend \"Marcia's\" house. Tiffany was opening her gifts and got to mine. Everything was fine until she opened up the rainbow one. She got really quiet and started looking around. A few of her relatives were giving weird looks. Her mom (who was sitting next to her) took it and made a face, saying the baby is \"too young for propaganda\". I was a little hurt and pointed out that some people had purchased the baby religious-themed toddler books as well. I don't have a problem with that, but was confused as to how one was okay and others weren't. Marcia quickly made sure Tiffany got the next gift. I assumed it was over. While it hurt and was weird in the moment, I didn't wish to harp on it. I don't like Tiffany's mother, we've had issues in the past with her making weird/judgemental comments towards me. I don't need her to like me and considering she doesn't live close by, I can maintain a relationship with Tiffany without us seeing each other.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I stayed behind to help clean up the shower. When I was taking the trash out, Tiffany followed me outside. She thanked me for the gifts but said I shouldn't have gone off registry with the books. I said I had a gift receipt if she wanted to exchange them. She said that wasn't the issue, but she knew what kind of people would be at the shower and I embarrassed her by bringing the book, as well as challenging her mother. I pointed out that her mother should be embarrassed for mocking a gift, as that hurt my feelings. Tiffany says I know what her mom is like and I brought unnecessary drama to the shower. I said that she is the one who followed me outside, I had let the issue drop and that I only bought the book as a genuine gift for her baby, something I assumed she and her husband would like. I pointed out several other people went off registry, were they getting chastised? Tiffany said no, but they didn't get her anything embarrassing. I got upset all over again, finished helping with the clean up but then left.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMarcia texted me later saying I have to understand where Tiffany is coming from, plus she's pregnant and hormonal. She told me to apologize for nearly ruining the shower. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I just don't bother with these things, we're never going to see eye-to-eye on these issues. If a friend gave an LGBTQ book to me in front of my family, I'd probably be a bit upset too.

I didn't register for any of those at my shower but I've used every single thing in the past 24 hours still and that first baby is 18mo.

While Tiffany should not have prioritized her bigoted family\u2019s comfort over supporting her friend, this was not the appropriate setting to force her to take this stand.

This was Tiffany\u2019s BABY SHOWER but instead of being able to feel fully celebrated and loved on, she had to be put in the middle of this uncomfortable situation while all eyes were on her. Yes, she should work on her allyship but it\u2019s also important to use common sense. Not every moment in life is appropriate to center around social issues. OP should\u2019ve just gotten something on the registry for the shower and given her this book in private.", "Yeah, I think this is a pretty good take. As a queer person raised in a religious family, if I knew a friend had a conservative religious family I probably wouldn\u2019t give them a \u201ccontroversial\u201d present at their baby shower, but I can see how that might not have occurred to OP. I would know that items like that have the potential to upset the mom-to-be\u2019s family, and I wouldn\u2019t want to be responsible for potentially instigating drama at such an important milestone, especially when the person at the center of it is probably feeling a lot of emotions. I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to put them in a position where they felt like they might have to potentially start an argument with their mother, or other family members. \n\nI also think it\u2019s important to point out that relationships with family members who believe different things than you can be messy. Like I said, im queer, but my mom is religious and fairly conservative. She didn\u2019t, and doesn\u2019t, support queerness, and very much thinks it\u2019s the sort of thing you can do, but at home in private. But I still love her, and I can see how her presence might be particularly important to me during pregnancy (especially assuming it\u2019s the friends first pregnancy). So like. I get it, and while I think the friend should have just dropped it, I can understand why the situation may have upset her.", "Summed it up precisely.

She did not flaunt it, she gave a wrapped gift. Not all baby showers include sitting and opening the presents together - there was a good chance it could\u2019ve stayed wrapped and friend couldve opened it after everyone had left thus no problems at all.\nThe friends mother is the problem here. Not the gift.", "You nailed it.", "Although I\u2019d say (I\u2019m LGBT with not entirely open family), it\u2019s not always safe to be openly an ally to everyone. Seeing that the mother sees discussing non-cis heteronormativity to children in an age appropriate way as \u201cpropaganda\u201d, she sounds like she\u2019s on the possibly more hostile side of homophobes.

Those religious baby books could cause this child to feel alone, wrong, afraid, etc. (source: queer kid that grew up Mormon). My choice to marry a woman would never stop you from practicing religion, but religion has MANY times over and over stopped queer people from living authentically, safely, and having the same rights as you. \n\nIt\u2019s inappropriate to impose personal beliefs on others. I understand this situation is unique, and those around her can easily assume Tiffany\u2019s beliefs align with the guests. OP felt this same way, she saw Tiffany as an ally. With the information given here, OP did not make a scene about their own sexuality, and ultimately dropped the situation. As LGBTQ people, we have to make these real world choices with every single person we meet 1) abandon/loose family/friends in order to live safely. 2) get in fights with family all the time over living authentically or 3) avoid living authenticity (or masking) around certain family members/every single person we interact with to remain safe. \n\nRecognize those issues from your comment? These are not unique to people who grew up religious. These are issues we all face. With this in mind, why would OP willingly put themselves in position like this? It\u2019s awkward and uncomfortable for everyone involved. Why did Tiffany even invite OP if this was a possibility of an issue. Tiffany knew if anything \u201cgay\u201d got brought up it would be an issue. She asked OP to come, and sit in the closet. This could also potentially be unsafe for OP if things turned ugly. We (queer people) usually avoid these types of situations. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that Tiffany\u2019s family chose to single out and be rude to OP. That\u2019s not very Christian of them. \n\nThe rest is for OP specificity by chance she reads this: Tiffany isn\u2019t an ally and neither is this person. I\u2019m so sorry you were put in this uncomfortable position. It\u2019s instances like these where we find out \u201cWho our true friends are\u201d. If she was an ally she would have warned you in order to keep you out of this situation and avoid it. You are not the asshole here.

You don\u2019t know what happens behind close doors. \n\nI completely agree. Fighting with grandma is a lost cause, same as with fighting with you. I\u2019m not demeaning Tiffany for not telling her mother she\u2019s wrong in front of everyone. But Tiffany also didn\u2019t come outside to apologize to OP on her mothers behalf. She came outside to continue to shame OP and rehash the issue. Which shows Tiffany\u2019s true colors. (Not an ally) \n\nShe didn\u2019t bring a book that was harmful, she didn\u2019t bring an atheist childrens book preaching how God is not real. She brought a book about diversity amongst families. Those books often talk about interracial families and non bio families as well. This book was intended to be harmless.

Not the time for fighting over human rights. It was family occasion, where people know about the tensions and avoid bringing anything argumentative up.\n\nIt was completely out of order to complain about the religious books. Why? Because this was a fight that didn't belong to this party. It was the future child's grandmother that was challenged. Ofcourse you can fight these thing were ever, but at this occasion all OP did was to alianate themselves from the friend.\n\nBuying the book was thoughtless but a mistake. Challenging what the relatives gave as present was tasteless.\n\nOfcourse you get the support you want from the like minded people.

Every step on this journey makes the world a better place for gay people (and the rest of us as well).

But I and others very much appreciated the heads up so we could decide whether to go over or not, and not get blindsided by uncle Dan's misogyny or Granny's homophobia.

Plus, it kept friends from getting caught in the middle or in trouble when they had no control over the situation and were not in a position to leave it.\n\n\nI feel it's a good policy. Had Tiffany mentioned her family was homophobic, I would have given a more neutral gift at the shower and given the book later. I wouldn't want to cause drama with her family at the shower.

How could my child trust me as a safe person? BUT I didn\u2019t change until I became a mom. And changing ruins relationships. I lost my relationship with parents and siblings for a while.

It wasn\u2019t up to you to \u201cdrop the situation\u201d, it was up to you to apologise because you should have known better. Pick your battles if what you truly care about is celebrating your friend, and stop trying to be the center of attention in someone else\u2019s event.\nPlus you intentionally ignored the registry\u2026 just follow it, it\u2019s there for a reason.", "These \"she's not an ally comments\" are going overboard.\n\nA baby shower is not the right venue for certain debates and it is unreasonable to expect her to excommunicate herself from her family. I'd really like to see people put their money where their mouth is as the vast majority of people I've encountered in life turn into church mice when it comes to confronting members of the family.\n\nIt is why seating arrangements at weddings is such a delicate matter. The general approach is trying to stay away from certain conversations and hide the alcohol from certain aunts and uncles.\n\nYTA. I don't buy not realising it would cause a stir. You wanted to test her which is a nasty thing to do at an event that isn't about you.", "Said gently, YTA. Just because Tiffany is An Ally doesn't mean everyone in her family is. And while I personally think it's a fine gift, it sounds like you knew who else might be there, and setting up a situation where she was forced to defend you wasn't cool.\n\nNext time I'd suggest sticking to the registry and/or giving the parents some advance notice before you gift books that might be controversial.", "\nThis is a tough one because you do have some claim to the moral high ground and a lot of this comes down to how honest you are being with us and yourself about your motives and level of awareness about your friend's family.  You mention that she has told you about her family and you have had poor interactions with her mother in the past.  You also have a conservative family of your own so you probably could predict how the gift might create conflict.   Your comments regarding religion also likely stoked rather than smoothed the conflict, but I can understand if that was reactionary because you felt hurt.  I suspect that you had reason to know the gift God not be appreciated or approved of by the mother at the least, whom you state you do not like. \n\nInadvertent or not, you put your friend in an awkward and stressful situation that you state you choose to avoid with your own family. What makes me lean toward a soft Y T A is that when that outcome became clear you didn't do anything to smooth the situation over or even empathize with your friend or express any kind of remorse for the awkward situation.  If you accidentally make a mess of a social situation there is usually some impulse toward repair. Your comment that \"I pointed out that her mother should be embarrassed for mocking a gift, as that hurt my feelings. Tiffany says I know what her mom is like and I brought unnecessary drama to the shower. I said that she is the one who followed me outside, I had let the issue drop and that I only bought the book as a genuine gift for her baby,\" seems to express that you feel you were the one entitled to an apology and you feel pretty ok with the scene you caused (righteous or not, you caused a scene at her party).  Would it have been more appealing for her to have cared about your feelings (you were in a vulnerable position and your identity judged) sure, which also pushes me towards E S H, but it sounds like she did try a little repair by thanking you for the gifts and bringing your attention to the awkwardness in a very gentle way. \n\nI think this is a situation where two things can be true: you can be righteously angry about your experience of anti-LGBT sentiment and also be something of an asshole for making this situation about you rather than your friend.. Maybe staking out the moral highground at her party and forcing a confrontation in that situation wasn't the kindest thing to do or a supportive move as a friend.\n\nI know that when I attend a party with the family of some people I care about there will be people that that dont like me because of aspects of my identity I can't control, feel strongly about, and are deeply personal.  When I show up I am showing to support my friend and their heart that I know and love and sometimes that means effecting to be deaf, dumb, or stupid and walking away from conversations I would normally never let slide because I am there to support my friend that day. If I can't do that because it hurts to much I can leave or not go and my friends will understand.  \n\nWhat you did was morally defensible but rude and unsupportive.  I do think that the embarrassment she expressed was about the awkward situation not about your identity or her support of you and stated because she thinks you stoked a confrontation on purpose, but as I cannot know I will land on a soft ESH", "ESH.

Something about THEM. \n\nSomehow, op managed to make this day that was supposed to be about her friend about her. And for that I\u2019d give her a soft NTA.", "Yeah, exactly. I\u2019m so annoyed by so many of these responses. Of course op is TA here.", "This was my thought too. I know what topics to avoid around my family but also my friends' families too. If you've known someone for years you probably know their families too. I think the gift is nice idea but she could've given it to her later when her mother wasn't around. Being lesbian around conservative people is hard but being straight and raised in a conservative family is hard too although people often don't see that. It's not easy to completely cut off family and we (the white straight people) are trying our best to be your allies while maintaining some contact with family. I'll go with soft YTA because you knew her mother and because it was a wrong time and place to solve that issue.", "Agree with this.", ">But you\u2019re not a true ally then?\n\nThat's okay with me, I don't put labels on myself and arbitrary gatekeeping doesn't mean anything to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Absolutely Tiffany is a fake ally!\n\nTiffany never claimed to be an ally. OP put that label on her.\n\nAlso, by OP's own admission she does the exact same thing her friend does, avoid talking about it or bringing up her views with her own family. This is one of OP's comments in the thread:\n\n>I am totally sympathetic to the \"lose family\" vs \"just ignore it\". I'm a lesbian who has conservative family members and I have to avoid certain issues, not talk about who I am around them, etc.\n\nSo she avoids confrontation with her own family, but is comfortable putting her friend in an uncomfortable situation? Seems like an AH move to me.", "Any reasonable person would do exactly what you just said when getting someone gifts for a baby shower.", "Also it\u2019s an issue that regardless of the outcome at the baby shower, it wouldn\u2019t have been fixed anyway. Pregnant person\u2019s family probably still feels this way no matter what so it\u2019s like, did you have to?", "This is so weird. Why cause a drama where your friend HAVE to defend you in a place that isn\u2019t safe for you to cause said drama? She knew bigoted people would be there, she knew the party isn\u2019t about her, she knew she\u2019s straight, she knew the bigoted people don\u2019t like her, so what other motive does she have except to make drama?\n\nThe book sounds great, tbh. But she could\u2019ve given it privately, or around friends that won\u2019t react negatively and stole the spotlight from the pregnant friend.", "My mom raised an eyebrow because we put a purple collar on our male dog. He was yellow and he looked good in purple!", "My sister and I were joking around (she teases me for being a straight and I tease for being gay... all in good fun) on social media and our Aunt jumped in about airing our families \"dirty laundry\" on a public forum.", "Look dude I\u2019m not gatekeeping shit. I\u2019m an unapologetic ally & I wish everyone was bc hating others is dumb. (Never said I hated this woman-just said she was not an ally). A true ally tries to understand what their friend is going through. An lgbtq person or black person cant just remove their label from society but an ally can? Yeah, no does not work that way. Why you are so gung ho to prove you\u2019re not homophobic? Bc it definitely reads that you are-a little doth protest too much. ALSO, I see you haven\u2019t responded to others who have responded to this. Hmmm? But we don\u2019t know about OP\u2019s situation-she literally could be risking her life & well-being by bringing up her sexuality in her family. Maybe they\u2019d try to have her go to a conversion camp or do other sad evil trick? The ally does not have to worry about that.  Also I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with OP\u2019s book-my gay friend would\u2019ve given me something like that to teach my daughter about her. OP even said she gave it at other baby showers. It isn\u2019t different than religious books? Some could argue that\u2019s propaganda.", "Yeah, in general, my stance as a queer person is that I bring up topics of social justice if I\u2019m either (a) in a setting where everyone will be supportive (b) in a setting where at least some people will be supportive (c) in a mental space where I will be able to defend myself if someone disagrees (d) in a position where defending myself if physically/mentally/emotionally/financially safe. And imo this mode of thinking should also apply to allies.", "Exactly. Most of the people die narrow minded and conservative. Causing awkward situation at a baby shower never changed anyone.", "*The biggest face-palm on earth*", "Projection at its best.", "I kind of need some INFO here too \u2014 were the religious books off registry? Because if so, then not only is Tiffany out of line for chastising her friend, she\u2019s a hypocrite too. Religious-themed books are as much \u2018propaganda\u2019 as a book about families that might look different (that is to say, *not propaganda*). And kids should be taught from a young age that not everyone will be like them, a book or books that help with that will make the kids better adults when they grow up.", "Don't bother, they really wanna play their Harry Potter game and not have anyone remind them that just passively allowing gays to exist isn't being an ally.", "It was literally about explaining the different colours of the flag. That\u2019s queer history. \n\nOP YTA you don\u2019t gift those books at a baby shower when you *know* your friends mum is conservative. \nIf you felt it was important for that baby to have a book on queer families you could have given it to your friend at another time.", "Raccoons are allies"]}
