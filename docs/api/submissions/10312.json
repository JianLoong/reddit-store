While she is straight and white, she always appeared to care about civil rights issues, posted about it on Facebook, talked to me about it in person, etc. She has always told me what a big deal this is because she was raised in a very conservative family. I am a lesbian, so knowing my friends are allies means a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTiffany is pregnant and today was her baby shower. However, I also love to give books at showers as I'm a huge advocate for child literacy. I bought a couple of classics and added in a book called \"Rainbow: A First Book of Pride\", which is a toddler book that just talks about what each color of the rainbow means and showcases what different families look like. I've given it at other showers before so I didn't see the big deal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe shower was held at our friend \"Marcia's\" house. Tiffany was opening her gifts and got to mine. Everything was fine until she opened up the rainbow one. She got really quiet and started looking around. A few of her relatives were giving weird looks. Her mom (who was sitting next to her) took it and made a face, saying the baby is \"too young for propaganda\". I was a little hurt and pointed out that some people had purchased the baby religious-themed toddler books as well. I don't have a problem with that, but was confused as to how one was okay and others weren't. Marcia quickly made sure Tiffany got the next gift. I assumed it was over. While it hurt and was weird in the moment, I didn't wish to harp on it. I don't like Tiffany's mother, we've had issues in the past with her making weird/judgemental comments towards me. I don't need her to like me and considering she doesn't live close by, I can maintain a relationship with Tiffany without us seeing each other.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I stayed behind to help clean up the shower. When I was taking the trash out, Tiffany followed me outside. She thanked me for the gifts but said I shouldn't have gone off registry with the books. I said I had a gift receipt if she wanted to exchange them. She said that wasn't the issue, but she knew what kind of people would be at the shower and I embarrassed her by bringing the book, as well as challenging her mother. I pointed out that her mother should be embarrassed for mocking a gift, as that hurt my feelings. Tiffany says I know what her mom is like and I brought unnecessary drama to the shower. I said that she is the one who followed me outside, I had let the issue drop and that I only bought the book as a genuine gift for her baby, something I assumed she and her husband would like. I pointed out several other people went off registry, were they getting chastised? Tiffany said no, but they didn't get her anything embarrassing. I got upset all over again, finished helping with the clean up but then left.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMarcia texted me later saying I have to understand where Tiffany is coming from, plus she's pregnant and hormonal. She told me to apologize for nearly ruining the shower. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Since some people are asking if I did this as some kind of stunt... \n\nI did not do it to create drama or make anyone uncomfortable. It seriously didn't cross my mind that this would be an issue. Because Tiffany herself has always appeared to be pro-LGBTQ+ rights, I didn't see the big deal. I figured it'd be a good book for an ally's library. I've always bought pro-LGBTQ+ children's books for baby showers and it's never been an issue. I wouldn't purposefully put any of my friends in an awkward situation.\n\n ", "created_utc": 1676755547, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115s5nk/aita_for_embarrassing_my_friend_at_her_baby_shower/", "score": 383, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Unfortunately, it looks like she will be raising her child according to \"bigot\" option...", "NTA. Tiffany is an ally when it\u2019s convenient, which is not how a true ally behaves. \n\nThe issue here wasn\u2019t that you went off-registry. Lots of people go off registry at baby and wedding showers, especially when they\u2019re close to the recipients. The issue was that Tiffany is unwilling to have an uncomfortable conversation with her mother. It\u2019s her choice what kind of relationship she wants to have with her mom, but without that conversation her mother feels like everyone in the room agrees with her. This gives her free rein to make out like you\u2019re the problem. These people won\u2019t change, and perhaps more importantly, Tiffany will never defend you to her mother.\n\nEdit: Don\u2019t apologize. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. \n\nTiffany is *not* an ally.\nI'm sorry you found out this way.", "NTA She called your gift embarrassing - I would love to know her reasoning why she thinks she can say that and still call herself an ally. A true ally would have been angry about her mom's treatment of her friend. I'm sorry you had to learn this about an alleged friend, but it's also a good thing you now know she only wants credit for being an ally and to appear like an ally and doesn't genuinely see you as her equal.", "NTA. But your friend and her mom are. Why didn't anyone defend your gift?\nI understand you're hurt. But being gay and asking for some parenting on diversity is not an AH move.\nPeople become strange idiots when they have kids.\n\nMaybe her mom is pushing to end your friendship, \"for the sake of the baby\". Nobody knows.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, imho.", "NTA and she\u2019s not an ally.", "NTA\n\nLook I'm not going to say Tiffany is not an ally for not wanting to fight with her mom at her baby shower, it's hard to put your foot down against family sometimes and some people truly struggle with it. \nBut I will say she's a hypocrite for going after you when you did the same as others. You bought something that while off the registry you thought she'd like.\n\nYou didn't buy anything \"embarrassing\", why would she be embarrassed over the ideas she allegedly shares?\n\nHonestly I would distance myself, don't reach out unless she does first. And tbh if she will not only not defend you but berate you for this I believe you should tell her that you want to step back from your friendship as you can no longer trust her. I sure wouldn't, I would never feel comfortable discussing this issues with her if she only thinks like this when it's convenient for her.\n\nALSO her mom was the one making sarky remarks, she could've just stayed quiet and not made a scene at the shower", "All the comments here are coming down to two types of people: those who think LGBTQ+ should be allowed to live visible lives, and those who are \"tolerant allies\" as long as they don't have to see it. Your friend is one of the latter. \n\nThere's no reason for it to have been given privately. There's no reason for you to apologize.", "I'm going with NTA. You bought something you thought she'd appreciate and she didn't. She's the one embarrassed by her family knowing that someone is *gasp* not straight.\nPs I desperately despise it when people get bent because you didn't buy specific items from a registry.  Ugh.", "NTA and she\u2019s a pretty crappy ally if she would call that embarrassing. What the fuck to anyone who would say otherwise.", "NTA.  I\u2019m an ally and my parents, friends and coworkers know it.  Her friends and family do not.  She should not have singled you out after the shower and she did not handle this well, pregnancy hormones or not.  Your friend can talk the talk, but that seems to be all.", "NTA \n\nWhy are people acting like the gift was something so scandalous. I was just a kids book ffs.\n\nLGBTQ+ people exist, different kind of families exist and they kid will for sure met them in real life, is not better foto everyone that the family talk them about it before hand? Regardless of your views on the matter pretend that everyone is hetero is foolish.", "NTA\n\nTiffany and Marcia need to work on themselves. One queer woman to another, these folks are not doing their work as allies. They decided Tiffany\u2019s mom\u2019s comfort in her bigotry was more important than affirming their supposed values (and friendship with you) with a big, \u2018THANK you so MUCH, Auntie Zookeeper! I can\u2019t wait to share this with baby!\u2019\n\nNobody should ever ask you to apologize for being out and proud and trusting them to be the allies they say they are. And job one of any ally with kids is to openly share those values with their children.", "NTA your friend was one though. You are either an ally or not.", "Anyone saying that you\u2019re ta is likely a bigot themselves. This was a thoughtful gift and you\u2019re NTA. Your friends family sucks.", "NTA. Your intent was good. It's unfortunate that people were  uncomfortable and more unfortunate that they spoke up about it when it wasn't their shower. It's not your job to make everyone around you comfortable at all times. It's an impossible task anyways. Tiffany wants everyone to be happy, but she's an adult and she shouldn't worry about it. It's not your job to apologize to Tiffany. It's Tiffany's job to set boundaries with her family.", "NTA.\n\nMy parents have some different views of mine and I don't let them dictate my taste and opinion publicly. If my mum had said something like hers said I'd have taken the book back and said it's important to understand how the world is rich of many people and would have moved on.\n\nI mean, if she's an ally it should not be a secret. If her mum is uneasy she doesn't have to put the blame on her daughter and you.\n\nNot the asshole. They were impolite.", "NTA. This is a wonderful book for a parent who really wants to educate their child in this world. Seems like your \u201cfriend\u201d is posing as an ally online and with you but probably hiding these posts from her mother and others on FB. She wanted to have it both ways and it all came crushing down at her baby shower. You don\u2019t need to support her hypocrisy.", "NTA.  Hopefully Tiffany will learn to stand up to others despite who they are to her sooner rather than later, especially since she has a child on the way and standing up for what\u2019s right is one of the most important lessons you can teach a child.  Either that or she\u2019s not an ally.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry you went through this. People who try to make bigots comfortable are not allies. And people who try to excuse that because \u201chormones\u201d aren\u2019t either. You don\u2019t owe anyone an apology. They owe you one, but I don\u2019t see that happening.", "NTA and btw Tiffany is not an ally she only pretends to be when it is convenient", "NTA, if the book's not ok at that event then that event was hostile and she either shouldn't have invited you or should have told you what to expect so you could bail. Her behavior was not allyship; it was shitty and homophobic", "Pregnancy hormones are not an excuse for Tiffany chastising you for your gift. You did nothing wrong. A true ally would have thanked you publicly for your gift and rebuked her mother for what she said to you. NTA.", "NTA but Tiffany is and so is her mother. You bought a lovely gift for a friend. The only thing that should have been said is \u201cthank you\u201d. Shame on the mother for making any comment and shame on your friend for making you feel bad about it. She is not an ally.", "It\u2019s very convenient to be an ally behind close doors or where one feels safe.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She\u2019s not really an ally if she\u2019s not willing to call her family out on their homophobia.", "NTA fk bowing to bigots. It\u2019s a book ffs. Religious books are sexist, bigoted propaganda.  Tiffany is a chameleon, she\u2019s whoever she\u2019s around. Those people aren\u2019t allies.", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't want it to be a big deal, but Tiffany (and her mother) made it one. Her being pregnant and hormonal has nothing to do with having a double life of \"ally\" and \"bigoted\". Having a non-Christian family isn't \"propaganda\" as Tiffany's mother called it.", "NTA\n\nI'm really sorry your friend didn't stand up for you. I get that the mother has weird or outdated views on the world, but I wouldn't let my mother chastise a friend of mine who means nothing but well. I understand that maybe at a baby shower you don't want to have any kind of drama or arguments, but some things are worth arguing about and I wouldn't want to have a friend hurt.", "NTA", "NTA. What a wonderful and thoughtful gift. It shows that you believe in Tiffany\u2019s ability to be the sort of mother who teaches her children acceptance.\n\nIt saddens me that Tiffany called the gift embarrassing. Why isn\u2019t she embarrassed at her mother for calling the contents of that book \u201cpropaganda\u201d? I\u2019d be deeply embarrassed, not to mention furious, if my mother said that.", "NTA. That sounds like a lovely gift and I'm sorry that your friend was just a perfomative \"ally\".", "NTA and I'm so sorry you're being treated badly. It's homophobia, pure and simple.", "NTA. I wouldn't consider a book \"going off registry,\" esp if it was part of a larger gift that included things from the registry. If she didn't want \"propaganda\" at her shower she should have told you.", "NTA and everyone responding otherwise are enablers at best.", "You know the saying, if there are 10 people at a dinner party and one of them is a Nazi, you have 10 Nazis at the dinner party.", "Yea no, the people placating to bigotry and ignorance are the assholes here.\n\n\nExample: my husbands mother has some ignorant ass behaviors inherited from being raised in a prejudiced community. She\u2019ll say shit like \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the white woman alone at night \u201c instead of just saying woman etc. all of us call her out EVERY SINGLE TIME and the conversation isn\u2019t over until she understands what was wrong with what she said. \nAllies are supposed to educate their prejudiced family members, not try to keep the damn peace with them.", "NTA. Tiffany sounds like a damn fraud. I can\u2019t stand that shit. Stand by your convictions or keep your mouth shut. She pretended to be a social-justice minded person yet she\u2019s catering to her bigoted family\u2019s feelings. I just don\u2019t play games like that and I would have kicked my mom out and anybody else who made a comment. A true ally makes it clear that behavior like that is unacceptable. \n\nTiffany is not an ally. Tiffany is likely a narcissistic who likes to have the world view her as some straight, white savior while she holes up with the bigots in her off-time. \n\nNow, if Tiffany didn\u2019t make a big stink about how woke she is all the time and you gave her the book, I can say as a queer person that it would seem a bit agenda-pushing. However, since this wasn\u2019t the case, I\u2019m giving you a firm NTA.", "NTA. She is not an ally, she clearly does not understand what it is to be an ally and she is invested in facilitating bigotry rather than standing up to it.\n\nYou got a book for her child based on the value system she had repeatedly communicated she believed in. Others went off registry, yet you were the only one targeted, so clearly the registry is not the issue. Her mother also publicly snubbed you and your gift, as your friend\u2019s guest, that was out of line. The fact your friend enabled her mother\u2019s offense is incredibly telling of who she really is. Homophobia aside, this was disrespectful and poor hosting. \n\nYou could try finding resources that explain situations like these, or detail what an ally is, to send to her. You could also just have a heart to heart with her explaining the behavior and how she betrayed you when she had an opportunity to step up as the ally she said she was. Otherwise, it may be time for you to reconsider the friendship.", "NTA. She\u2019s an ally unless she has to stand up to her own bigoted family. So she\u2019s an ally as long as she doesn\u2019t have to do anything. Not really an ally.  How were you supposed to know she was actually a coward?", "NTA. There\u2019s a difference in being an ally and saying you support something you refuse to openly stand up for. As a straight white woman I use every opportunity to try to stop bigotry and judgmental people, even if they are family. You\u2019re never to old to learn how to be decent human being. I tell that to my racist grandpa often. I refuse to let him misgender or use any kind of slurs. He is progressing nicely if I say so myself.", "You are NTA.  I\u2019m sorry your friend was so insensitive.", "NTA if those people are offended by something like this then GOOD. Make them uncomfortable. Sorry your friend is not the Ally you thought she was.", "NTA. I'm a straight white ally with family members who aren't. I don't associate with them regularly but they may be invited to a significant event. Anyone who follows me on social media knows my stance, and I've never made it secret if it's brought up in social settings. I'd much rather a book like this, than a religious one, but that may be because I'm an atheist. I'm not sure she's much of am ally if this kind of gift would embarrass/upset her. I wouldn't even be upset by a religious book, as it's the thought that counts.\n\nYWBTA if this were a stunt, but as your edit explicitly states it wasn't, and I'm inclined to believe you, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. She\u2019s not an ally. I have seen those types of baby books and they are becoming more and more popular. It\u2019s not propaganda, it\u2019s just showing what actual families look like. You ruined nothing. They made a big deal out of a baby book.", "NTA.\n\nIf she didn't like the book, she should have smiled, said thank you, and put it away somewhere. That's what real allies do.", "NTA. Your friend is walking a line that she probably hates. She is trying to keep a relationship with some of her family while supporting her friends. It\u2019s not always easy to walk away from family who have differing beliefs and that\u2019s probably where she lives. She may not have the ability to be angry with them because of who they are in her life so she\u2019s angry at the person she can trust. Plus she\u2019s pregnant. Give her a few days. Take her out for lunch and give her an opportunity to talk. Just remember her hormones are a little crazy at the moment.", "Commenting again to say; let this friendship die on this bill if need be. You are the person owed an apology here", "NTA for sure. These people suck. Just because it\u2019s thorny, difficult work to create boundaries with her mother thus ensuring an inclusive, respectful, bigotry-free space in her own damn house, doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t necessary for her to do that work, particularly if she wants to be known as an ally. Give me a break. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you had endure that toxicity, that you had to learn the disappointing truth about Tiffany, and that now you have to read all the nonsensical Y T A\u2019s in here from a bunch of other Tiffanys that are just telling on themselves.", "Soft YTA. I really do understand where you\u2019re coming from. But you\u2019ve said in comments that you yourself do not speak about LGBTQ+ topics with your own conservative family to keep the peace. \n\nWhy would you not give your close friend (who is pregnant and vulnerable- likely wanting her family\u2019s support right now) the same grace?", "NTA, but this is pretty borderline, this seems like something you knew was going to cause issues with her mother, or at least you should have known was going to cause issues. I'll give you a pass though since it seems as though you were genuinely unaware that this could cause issues.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry you were\nTreated so poorly", "So what all the Y T A people are saying is that THEY aren\u2019t homophobic, BUT homophobia is okay. As long as you don\u2019t start DRAMA. What a gross mindset. All the homophobia apologists in the comments are the asshole. NTA", "\"I'm an ally,\" as long as it doesn't inconvenience the homophobes I try to please first. NTA.", "NTA: I am sorry. I know your heart is hurting and mourning the loss of the friend you thought you had.", "NTA. I can totally understand if this isn\u2019t a fight she wanted to have with her mother and for that reason wishes to avoid \u201cpolitics\u201d (even though we know it\u2019s really human issue and not politics) but I do not understand her calling it embarrassing. That\u2019s where this whole thing gets messy for me. I\u2019m sorry. It must be difficult to feel in this much of a weird place with a close friend you considered an ally.", "NTA. I honestly think you handled yourself very well in the moment, despite the obvious bigotry from your friend\u2019s mom. I\u2019m not sure why she chose to corner you outside, especially as you mentioned you had dropped it despite your understandably hurt feelings. \n\nThere\u2019s something to be said about pregnancy hormones so maybe it\u2019s worth giving your friend a pass, but still NTA.", "NTA.  You found a hypocrite", "NTA - we have that book and love it. She is clearly not a friend and this was clearly not a stunt on your part. It\u2019s a perfectly viable book. No one blinked when I got that book at my shower alongside the religious books from my conservative side of the female. The problem is her family", "NTA and it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s really an ally. An ally would have smiled and thanked you for the book and shut down any family drama.", "NTA. If she's only an ally when bigots aren't looking, then she's not an ally.", "NTA", "NTA and the people saying YTA are either not reading the full post or are also in the same boat as your friends mom and are bigots. \n\nFrom the post we can assume you and Tiffany are very close and a time may come where Tiffany\u2019s child asks how come you and your family are \u201cdifferent\u201d to Tiffany\u2019s and the book would have been a gentle way to explain it to the child. \n\nTiffany has however outed herself as a fake ally, saying the book is embarrassing and no one else\u2019s was when they were pushing their religious beliefs etc. because for the most part who doesn\u2019t have family members on social media, so surely they see the stuff she posts about on there? \n\nAgain. NTA and probably have a think about whether you want this friendship to continue now she\u2019s shown her true colours, have a sit down with her maybe and see why she said what she said to you after she\u2019s had the baby", "YTA because you knew what her mom was like and knew it would cause trouble.\n\nYou are in the right here, in general.  Closed minded judgementalism towards various lifestyles is wrong. \n\nBut. . so many of us were born into closed minded religion-based families, and despite not holding those views ourselves and doing everything we can to show support towards diversity in the world, are completely unable to have any kind of conversation about certain topics without things quickly devolving into a judgmental shouting match and long lasting tension.  We've TRIED. . we've gotten in all the fights many times. . and there's a giant wall there that cannot be breached.\n\nSo the real world choices are 1. abandon/lose the family 2. get in fights with family all the time over social issues or 3. avoid certain topics around certain family members.\n\nThis is going to get hit with downvotes and \"not an ally\" I'm sure, but this is just the reality of life for those of us unfortunate enough to be born into extremely conservative and religious families.  I think people in general need to be a bit more sensitive towards those caught in the middle of \"lose my family\" vs \"ignore certain issues around family\" and its something of an AH move to force social issues on family events for others.", "I can\u2019t decide. I feel like you were a little thoughtless. People have complicated relationships with family and I feel like you were inconsiderate in not anticipating this reception.  You say it never crossed your mind, but I feel that\u2019s the problem, it should have. \n\nNo doubt your friend has had to be very considerate of your feelings on numerous occasions, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask for the same effort.  I think YTA here. Slightly selfish and short-sighted of you.", "NTA. Your friend became the asshole when she followed you outside not to apologize for her mom but to chastise you. I'm sorry that happened.", "I'm going with an unpopular ESH\n\nA newborn doesn't listen to stories and grasp concepts. They listen to the sound and tone of their parent's voice.  And I read a stupid amount of books each year, so please know that is coming from an avid look lover and literacy proponent. But the gift seems more about you than a baby or what the parents of a newborn asked for on their registry. \n\nThe mother of your friend is a bigot, so obviously she sucks. \n\nYour friend also shouldn't have followed you outside and chastised you for your gift or your confrontation with her mother. \n\nThe bottom line is, you're significantly responsible for the situation. (You knew the family was full of bigots and how they might react, yet you chose to go off-registry and buy something sure to draw their (gross) disapproval.) \n\nYes, you also should be able to defend yourself when someone treats you badly, as her mother did. And she (your friend) did not defend you or ask her mother to stop, which also sucks. \n\nBut anyone could see how that gift would be received in that company. And you chose to create the ikelihood of that happening during her baby shower. \n\nEdit to add what I hope was obvious- don't make other people's events all about you.", "NTA for giving the book. But kinda for giving it at the shower where you knew her Conservative relatives would be. It took the attention off of Tiffany and onto you & the book.", "YTA \n\nStop trying to make everything about you. You know what her family is like and should've known your gift would create unnecessary drama. You don't need to be the center of attention at someone else's event.", "NAH\n\nLook, Tiffany may or may not be an ally. But bottom line is that she's not going to alienate her mom for being conservative. And that's a pretty common situation. \n\nIn this case you are the problem to her because you are the more dispensable party. You're a good friend, but her mom is her mom and she didn't want you arguing with her mom at what was supposed to be a fun event.", "NAH. Assuming you genuinely believed that the pride book wouldn't cause an issue with the relatives, it was a nice gift that shared something that is important to you. But I also can't entirely fault Tiffany for her reaction. She's certainly leading a double life, being (performatively?) \"woke\" online while catering to her family's homophobic views, but as a queer person myself with many conservative acquaintances I know that navigating these social situations is not as black and white as people like to think it is. That said, it's still horribly hypocritical that the religious books were fine but your pride book was not, and that Tiffany's being excused with the cranky and hormonal argument.", "This feels like you knew exactly how Tiffany\u2019s family would respond to your gift and you wanted to create an opportunity for her to prove her allyship to you. A baby shower is not the moment for this. Why would you do this to your friend? This was just unnecessarily rude. Buy a gift off the registry next time. YTA.", "I'm a little confused with my vote so it will be a soft ESH\nYou had already had problems with Tifanny's mom and without realizing it and I hope without bad intentions you and Tifanny's mom turned the baby shower into an awkward discussion about gender, religion and sexual preferences. They both made Tifanny uncomfortable, Marcia realized that and I feel like she's right. You should apologize. Not because of the book itself, in my opinion I feel that every gift is important and above all it is important to teach a child that there are different types of families and people to create adults with tolerance, inclusion and awareness. Now, I also think that Tifanny's mother should apologize for creating unnecessary drama, if she didn't like the gift it was enough to pretend and not say it. Regarding Tifanny, I don't think she is a false ally, at least in my country baby showers are in the last stages of pregnancy. She must be dealing with a lot of pressures in addition to physical and hormonal changes, maybe she just wanted something quiet that turned into a war camp. And I can understand that she doesn't want drama with her mother at this point, for some reason a lot of pregnant women take refuge in their mother at this stage. My advice is to keep giving away those books but not at baby showers if you know that the family is conservative and can create unnecessary drama and stress for the pregnant woman. Then do it privately, As I said before, I still consider it a good gift.", "I get where you\u2018re coming from but you\u2018re still the asshole. You knew about her family\u2018s beliefs and knew they would be there. You intentionally put Tiffany in a situation you knew or at least had to expect to be uncomfortable.

While she is straight and white, she always appeared to care about civil rights issues, posted about it on Facebook, talked to me about it in person, etc. She has always told me what a big deal this is because she was raised in a very conservative family. I am a lesbian, so knowing my friends are allies means a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTiffany is pregnant and today was her baby shower. However, I also love to give books at showers as I'm a huge advocate for child literacy. I bought a couple of classics and added in a book called \"Rainbow: A First Book of Pride\", which is a toddler book that just talks about what each color of the rainbow means and showcases what different families look like. I've given it at other showers before so I didn't see the big deal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe shower was held at our friend \"Marcia's\" house. Tiffany was opening her gifts and got to mine. Everything was fine until she opened up the rainbow one. She got really quiet and started looking around. A few of her relatives were giving weird looks. Her mom (who was sitting next to her) took it and made a face, saying the baby is \"too young for propaganda\". I was a little hurt and pointed out that some people had purchased the baby religious-themed toddler books as well. I don't have a problem with that, but was confused as to how one was okay and others weren't. Marcia quickly made sure Tiffany got the next gift. I assumed it was over. While it hurt and was weird in the moment, I didn't wish to harp on it. I don't like Tiffany's mother, we've had issues in the past with her making weird/judgemental comments towards me. I don't need her to like me and considering she doesn't live close by, I can maintain a relationship with Tiffany without us seeing each other.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I stayed behind to help clean up the shower. When I was taking the trash out, Tiffany followed me outside. She thanked me for the gifts but said I shouldn't have gone off registry with the books. I said I had a gift receipt if she wanted to exchange them. She said that wasn't the issue, but she knew what kind of people would be at the shower and I embarrassed her by bringing the book, as well as challenging her mother. I pointed out that her mother should be embarrassed for mocking a gift, as that hurt my feelings. Tiffany says I know what her mom is like and I brought unnecessary drama to the shower. I said that she is the one who followed me outside, I had let the issue drop and that I only bought the book as a genuine gift for her baby, something I assumed she and her husband would like. I pointed out several other people went off registry, were they getting chastised? Tiffany said no, but they didn't get her anything embarrassing. I got upset all over again, finished helping with the clean up but then left.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMarcia texted me later saying I have to understand where Tiffany is coming from, plus she's pregnant and hormonal. She told me to apologize for nearly ruining the shower. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
