What kind of lesson would it be for her if mommy would just bail her out every time she has to face the consequences of her actions?", "NTA, good job.  An important lesson to learn is \"guilty by association\" or  you are often assumed to be the company you keep. Don't put yourself in these situations, if you aren't partaking.

You are the grown up and she needs consequences.", "NTA. If her friends are doing it she probably is too but she had the choice to leave the bathroom and didn\u2019t so consequences. She should not learn to avoid them.

Did you read the paperwork where they described what happened?", "NTA and if you\u2019re in the US, schools often require a discipline summary when students transfer in.  And if the school is in the same system, it\u2019s most likely a system requirement so she would have to do it at her new school.", "NTA.  Hopefully this is a powerful lesson for her - don't be around when your friends are doing stupid shit.", "Nta.  This is a life lesson, sometimes you are guilty by association of the company you keep.  Seems like a stiff punishment by the school but that is what it is", "Decidedly NTA, this is where they get addicted, and learning to resent that behavior is important. Friends who vape leads to vaping, almost always.", "NTA - the education about vaping she'll get in there is valuable information.", "NTA \n\nYou're teaching her she can't just run away from her problems(which is what changing schools would be). That is far to much effort to go to, to get out of a program. Maybe there's an underlying issue and this is just the catalyst?\nEither way unless she has a good reason(which this isn't). She stays and does the punishment. \nShe was complicit, she could have told them to stop or walked out but she didn't. It's a good teaching moment teenagers bow to peer pressure. Maybe next time she'll stand up for herself and not get involved.", "NTA. She completes the program. She made choices that put her in a situation and this is the consequence.

I get where you're coming from but I was in a similar situation to your daughter and all it did was breed resentment towards my parents and reinforce that they didn't trust me and I couldn't trust them to have my back.

It sounds a bit excessive", "It's a little harsh, but it's not a bad lesson.  Is she in junior high, or is she in high school?

You\u2019re doing the right thing by not allowing your daughter to escape the consequences of her actions. She knew that vaping was against the rules and she chose to be in the presence of girls who were doing it. Maybe next time she\u2019ll remember to watch the company she keeps.", "I have to say YTA. \n\nMy school had students doing so many assignments from every teacher that if they did something like this, the student would definitely fail to keep up with actual important grades that they already couldn't keep up with to begin with since every teacher treats students as if no other teacher ever assigns assignments. \n\nYou are teaching her that if she follows the rules like a good girl, she gets punished anyway. That there is no escaping punishment for being good, so what is the point in being good if not breaking rules is treated the same as breaking them? If she really didn't vape, you are teaching her that she can't trust you to play the protective role that a parent is supposed to play and that there is no reason to follow rules if she is going to get punished anyway. \n\nThis vape program is just plain excessive and over the top. Multiple assignments a week for the rest of the year? Yeah, no, every parent who actually cares about their child and their child's grades would fight against that. There is no reason for why it should be multiple neverending assignments. One week would suffice.\n\n> she shouldn\u2019t be in that program if she doesn\u2019t vape, but on the other hand I wasn\u2019t in that bathroom. \n\nYou think she's guilty by default just because you weren't there? You are not someone who she can trust in the future is what you're saying. \n\nYou have lived with your child for 14 years, you have no reason to have absolutely no idea what kind of person your kid is. You should be able to judge whether you think she would vape instead of using not being there as a witness as a scapegoat. \n\n> I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s lying or telling the truth. \n\nBut you should know if your child tends to be a liar. You don't have to know if she lied to know if that's her personality.\n\nI've known parents like you. Blindly believing the school and not being a parent when it's most needed for you to be a parent is how you lose your kid when they grow up. You don't have a kid if your kid can't trust you you in any needed capacity. \n\nThis vape program is extreme, even if she did vape, it's way over the top and shouldn't be allowed.", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This a good lesson to learn stay away from people who will drag you down.", "NTA good lesson for your child on who to associate with .\n\nHowever I do have a question ? Is your daughter still friends with these other children and did these other children stick up for her and tell the teachers that she was not partaking (if they actually did why don\u2019t you go to the school to discuss)?\nI think your daughter should be angry with her friends rather than you for what is happening", "Ah, one of the \"fun\" parts of parenting, having to enforce consequences for the children's poor decisions and then getting called an asshole because of it. NTA. You might not have been there but regardless she was caught hanging out with the kids that were vaping so whether she was or not she gets to fulfill the consequences of that. Those consequences are the vaping course and you get to be the bad guy in her eyes for enforcing it. Good on you for upholding the consequences.", "NTA. As you say, regardless of whether she was actually vaping herself: (a) she knew vaping was against school rules, and depending where you are possibly illegal at that age, (b) she knew her friends were vaping and chose to not extricate herself from the situation, and (c) I\u2019ve been around somebody who vapes indoors, and that shit gets _everywhere_ so even if she wasn\u2019t sticking the vape stick in her mouth, she was still passively vaping. Good call on making her complete the programme.", "Nta \n\nCould offer this as a third option and see her response:\n\noffer to let her transfer after she completed the vape program. \n\nThat way if she was looking for a way to leave the friend group, you could take the hit: yeah, even though I completed the program my horrible parent says they dont trust me or something and I have to change schools, can you believe it??!!\n\nBut she'd still have done the program, and so experienced the consequences for her actions.", "Give her a nicotine test. It doesn\u2019t last in the body long though so maybe it\u2019ll be gone by then, but if she\u2019s addicted then she\u2019s probably still smoking so maybe it still would show up", "NTA. \n\nShe was there. Like you said, you weren't in the bathroom, so you don't know what she was doing.  \n\nMaybe the program will help her and make her think twice next time she's put in that situation. \n\nAlso, it's a lesson she can't run from her mistakes.", "INFO: Can a doctor test her for whatever substance was in the vape pen? (Either weed or nicotine?) If she tests negative, she can transfer schools and take it as a lesson to be careful who she associates with.

That's the oldest parental lie in the book.", "NTA. I never got caught smoking in school and vaping came after I graduated, but I was in in school suspension a few times for other things and saw all the silly videos and paperwork people who got caught smoking do (we were in the same room for In School Suspension, so like your daughter if shes telling the truth, I like her got the same punishment lol). Its a bunch of nonsense, but it won't be the end of the world for your daughter, but make no mistake about it, they're useless. Kids are dumb, they're gonna smoke or vape and no amount of videos of tragedy porn a school forces them to watch like Clockwork Orange will change that.", "NTA, don't allow her to escape consequences by playing you and the school system!", "NTA, this is a great learning opportunity for your daughter.", "Learning they should have better friends", "The thing is, it's not that she may or may not have been vaping. It was that she put herself in that position. She could have walked out at any time *knowing vaping was illegal at school*. The daughter does need to face the consequences because per the school *she was caught red handed*. That is how the world works. It's better she learns to cover her ass and not put herself in situations that are immoral, illegal, and/or dangerous. By letting her off she learns that all she needs to say is \"I didn't do it so I shouldn't face the consequences\". While criminal charges won't apply (sometimes) she can still be expelled from college, fired from jobs, etc. etc. as an adult.", "I'm YTA too, she is asking to no longer be associated with these girls, this might be the out she is looking for. I would be tempted to dig deeper about the relationship she has with them and what else transferring will bring. It amazes me how well my teenage daughter reacts positively in every way when I listen to her. I don't always but I'm trying! Show her trust.", "Hardcore YTA I wanted to transfer out of my hs bit my parents didn\u2019t listen. All it\u2019s built since is resentment and hate. OP if you wanna lose you\u2019re kid, then let her stay in the vape program. If you still want your daughter around and in her life, listen to her. Otherwise accept that someone else will probably walk her down the aisle."]}
