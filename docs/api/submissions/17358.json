Your child has special needs, and specialized formula/snacks are not cheap. You weren\u2019t withholding the food to be cruel or teach your sister/nephew a lesson, you were simply prioritizing the needs of your child who is in a delicate circumstance.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re not responsible for having extra \u201cnormal\u201d snacks for other people. And does your husband help prepare these snacks for Elizabeth? Why doesn\u2019t he get the normal snacks for others?", "NTA, and she was fine to ask once, but not to push. You offered a good solution that she chose not to do. \n\nThat being said, I almost always try to have enough snack for all the kids at play dates (when it\u2019s just a few kids), and have found that most parents we hang out with do the same. It\u2019s like a ward against potential upset, disappointment, and hanger, and I go home with all but what my kids eat 90% of times, but I\u2019ve been so glad to have the extras every time they\u2019ve been needed.", "NTA- I would have said NAH, but she kept asking. I think since they were her special snacks you made to help her gain weight you're good. I think it would have been nice for you to give one to your nephew, but you're not the ah for not. You offered to watch him so she could go get some. That seems fair.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t responsible for other people\u2019s snacks.", "\"I already explained that these are specific items to address Elizabeth's medical needs, so they are unavailable for sharing. Period. I've also offered to watch Liam while you run to get him a snack. Unless you are having some kind of financial issue with affording a snack or physical issue with running the errand--and if it's either of those, I would hope that we are close enough that you would feel comfortable sharing your struggles with me--but unless there is a specific reason you can't get your own non-medical snack, I'm having a really difficult time understanding your fixation with Elizabeth's snacks.\"\n\nNTA. It's particularly off-putting that the mother of a young child would risk modeling such poor behavior for her son: he is exactly at the age where it is important to teach him that he isn't entitled to other people's things, and that he must respect it when other people tell him \"no\"...how is he going to learn if his own mother continually harasses people who say no to her?", "You're not the asshole, but I always keep snacks my kid can share with friends in my purse for playdates.  If we're going to see a friend with allergies, I make sure the snacks are safe for both of them.  My kid is always more willing to eat if other people are eating too, and it's a great bonding activity to eat with friends at any age.", "Your not the asshole but keeping small cheap snack probably isn\u2019t a bad way to keep this from happening in the future. Plus then you would always have a snack too. You absolutely shouldn\u2019t fell like you have to, your not obligated to pay for snacks your kid won\u2019t eat.", "NTA\n\nMy son, 9, believes he should be able to drink my grandmother's Ensure Plus. No is a complete sentence and he never asked me again. She should have taken a walk across the street. If you were stranded on a mountain then of course, but across the street was a whole store of options.", "OP your SIL is entitled and lazy to get snacks on her own that she should have remembered to begin with.  Being a bit more stringent about it, you shouldn't be responsible for providing snacks for other people's children \"just in case\" because who would have the foresight and willingness to have extra special snacks designed specifically for Elizabeth's needs during a playdate, and I'm sure all of your extra spending money is taken up with your fostering a special needs child which you can only get a certain amount of funds for assistance.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I was a tiny child who couldn't gain weight and had to have special snacks during school and 2 during the evenings. It worked though, I finally got to a normal weight. \n\nAlso, have you ever drank pediasure or boost? Gag! Do they sell the Fairlife Core Power protein shakes where you are? I'm in the states and they are SO good! They literally taste like milkshakes but they have a ton of protein in them. As long as they don't have any of her allergens in them you should see if she likes them because she'll probably drink them down like milkshakes every day!", "I make everything at home and the doctors office gives us some of the specialized formula/shakes but it\u2019s still a lot plus making everything is a pain in the ass and I\u2019d rather take them home and save them for later if she doesn\u2019t eat them while we\u2019re there.", "^This is the best answer.  Especially when there were ther food options within walking distance and you offered to watch your nephew while your SIL went to the store.\n\nEdit for judgement: NTA", "I do all of the cooking and Elizabeth\u2019s snacks falls into that category. I also work approximately 20-25 hours per week and he works 45-50 so the majority of the kid stuff is on me.", "Thanks. I don\u2019t usually do little kids so this is still pretty new to me.", "Right? It's along the same lines as asking for a diabetic kid's high glucose snacks; the kid doesn't have the snacks just for funsies, but to deal with a medical problem.", "This. \n\nAnd sharing snacks is a good way for little kids to bond. Elizabeth might also be more willing to eat her snacks if her foster cousin is also eating those snacks.", "That's what I was thinking too. SIL has had years of planning play dates and going out with her kid so she should be used to bringing snacks for her kid. Buy the time my kids hit this age I always made sure to have drinks and snacks on hand for my kids and never expected others to share their kids food.\n\nNTA", "Elizabeth likes them. She usually drinks a full one every day and I sneak them in to her fruit pouches, puddings, homemade ice cream, pudding, and smoothies so she gets at least another one through those.", "I understand :) even if it\u2019s not expensive, it\u2019s still a lot to have to worry about. Definitely NTA, and I wish Elizabeth (and you!) all the best!", "So, your husband believes all the cooking and childcare takes a total of 25 hours a week.  Hmmm\u2026", "Littles getting hungry is usually sudden and severe. The meltdown tends to follow fast if you don\u2019t get that blood sugar up again. \n\nThank you for fostering!", "Or open to trying other snacks she otherwise wouldn\u2019t! Peer pressure can be used positively too! I use to teach swim lessons and when scared kids would see the other kids do something and they were ok they were more receptive to give it a try!", "Thank you", "Yup. Elizabeth is usually pretty hungry when I pick her up from school (right before lunch) and it\u2019s not pretty. I\u2019m working with her school to see if they could let her have an extra snack before I pick her up but it\u2019s pretty difficult.", "If the school is being difficult don't be afraid to use the doctor to get them what the kid needs.\n\nI don't know if it applies to earlier schools but in k-12 it's not super hard to get a 504 or and IEP for something medically related", "Would having a car snack work? I know a lot of people who do that.", "NTA. I also think you need to have a serious conversation with your husband about how much labor goes into preparing her meals. I bet $50 he thinks you just toss some stuff together in 10-15 min so it\u2019s no big deal. My husband made a similar mistake when he decided to get on me about not \u201ckeeping house\u201d (we both work full time jobs, I work in an office and he WFH). So I decided to do EXACTLY what he does on our off days, which was nothing. After the house was destroyed he stopped flapping his gums.", "NTA. Your sil is just lazy/entitled. Keep to that boundary. Chances are she gonna keep going after Elizabeth's food. \n\nSome ppl act extra entitled whenever they're around those with special needs, because they can't stand the idea of being overshadowed by anyone, even if the other person(s) needs extra care. And it's disgusting. Ablelism at it finest, right?\ud83d\ude43 \n\nJust keep to your boundaries. She'll start showing her true colors soon enough if this continues at all.", "NTA. First of all, thank you for being awesome and fostering with love. Elizabeth's food is equivalent to medication or medical treatment. There's no reason to give up her medication just because your nephew's mom is lazy enough to not pack/buy a snack for her kid.", "NTA your concern is your child not anyone else\u2019s.. your sister kept asking for the snacks to prove a point that she could make you give them up when there was a store right across the street.. your husband is a ah along with your sister ,obviously he\u2019s not the one making the extra effort that goes into giving this child what she needs food wise, so it doesn\u2019t  matter to him the effort and time out of your day that goes into making her snacks from scratch", "nta. why do you have to make sure you are equipped to feed everyone you come across? does hubs keep pockets full of snacks for others just in case?\n\nwhy do you have to be more responsible than others? Why doesn't your SIL pack treats for your kid so you don't have to?\n\nis SIL your hubby's sister?", "NTA.\n\nGoing out without snacks is asking for trouble. And you gave your sister options. If she wasn't prepared, she should deal with it.", "Why didn't the other mother have snacks.  Surely she knew her child would  be hungry?.  Why is this on op to provide snacks?   If I had play dates with young children  each mother provided,  sometimes we shared,  but it wasn't  down to one mother being the food provider", "What mother takes a young child out with no snacks?  Op definitely not ah.", "And SIL had the opportunity to go buy something for her son and she refused!! NTA op"]}
