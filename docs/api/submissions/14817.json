Your brother wasn\u2019t mad and it\u2019s his opinion that matters in this. Many young men your brother\u2019s age would have just ignored the call. He actually cares for you unconditionally from the looks of it. He doesn\u2019t want you in any danger and you would be taking the bus. With any luck this text from his girlfriend to you will clue him in to who she really is. At any age I wouldn\u2019t have been upset by a man doing this to me for your reason.

That\u2019s a discussion she should have restricted to having with your brother if she had an issue with his simply being a good big brother who cares for his kid sister\u2019s safety and well-being.

It wasn't her place to take her frustration out on you.", "Nta, and she\u2019s obviously very selfish and doesn\u2019t have any younger siblings that she cares for -because your brother did what any good hearted person would do for their younger sibling if they thought they were somewhere at 10 o\u2019clock at night with no ride. I definitely think that your brother needs to be talking to her and defending you about how inappropriate it is for her to reach out to you especially with the age difference and you being 16 years old. I\u2019m 24 but I literally wouldn\u2019t even argue back with anybody under the age of literally like 19 because it\u2019s so childish.", "Definitely NTA. You didn't know he was on a date when you asked. And he is right, it was his choice to come get you. His GF sounds awful. You're family and your brother obviously cares a lot about you and your safety. This is her issue, not yours.", "NTA. Your brother didn't mind, your dad isn't reliable, you weren't safe.

I bet it's forgotten about in a few days", "ESH - if you knew he was with his gf and they don\u2019t see each other often, the kind thing would be wait for dad. Although it sounds like your dad is fond of the \u2018ol drinky drinky drive drive. So he doesn\u2019t seem like a safe option. Maybe next time tell your job you can\u2019t do closing because you\u2019ve no way of getting home. At 21 this girl should behave better. It\u2019s really childish texting you like that.

Hooray for your big brother. If he\u2019d had a problem, he could have asked you to contact your father instead.\n\nIt\u2019s a weird thing for her to be upset about.

It doesn't sound like you knew he was on a date. So you didn't do it intentionally. And either way this is up to your brother and his gf to solve. She should not have involved you. She can put on her big girl pants and talk to him about it. \n\nI remember when my husband and I had just started dating in our early 20's and his sister called and they talked for an hour or something. I don't recall what it was about, boy trouble maybe, but my reaction was that it's awesome that he loves his sister so much. \n\nYea it sucks that they don't get a lot of time together and she has a right to be annoyed with him leaving but she should be having that discussion with him, not you. This is not on you and don't let her behaviour make you afraid to ask your brother for help. If he's not mad at you or bothered by you asking for help them go with what he says. You could maybe let him know that if he's on a date next time you call for any type of help that is non emergency then he can say that and you'll call your dad. \n\nCommunication, easy peasy.", "NTA", "NTA.

The girlfriend sounds like a nightmare, though.", "NTA: You\u2019re brother sounds awesome, and he obviously cares about you. His GF sounds \u2026 a little less awesome. If he\u2019s the one picking you up, and he said that he wants to do it and even said to ignore his GF, then that\u2019s the correct thing to do.

Your life is more important than her movie night.", "NTA sounds to me like she got mad at bro and he shut her down immediately, so now she\u2019s taking it out on you. Tell her her issues are with your brother and she needs to stop bringing it up with you because you were doing what he told you to", "NTA If she wants to be mad, she can take it up with your brother. She isn't because she is well aware that he voluntarily chose picking you up and making sure you were safe over watching a movie with her, and he would make the same choice again. \n\nShe can't control him directly, so she is trying to control him indirectly by driving you away.", "NTA.
