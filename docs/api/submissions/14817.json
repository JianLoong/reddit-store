I definitely think that your brother needs to be talking to her and defending you about how inappropriate it is for her to reach out to you especially with the age difference and you being 16 years old.

I don't recall what it was about, boy trouble maybe, but my reaction was that it's awesome that he loves his sister so much. \n\nYea it sucks that they don't get a lot of time together and she has a right to be annoyed with him leaving but she should be having that discussion with him, not you. This is not on you and don't let her behaviour make you afraid to ask your brother for help. If he's not mad at you or bothered by you asking for help them go with what he says.
