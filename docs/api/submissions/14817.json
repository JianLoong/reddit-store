That\u2019s what older brothers are *for*.  :-)", "Why not just go with him, and continue the date after they dropped her at home?", "Exactly this if anything I'd be more impressed with the guy", "It is better for her to plan better, or call her dad. Or find another job.", "Keyword, **good**. Most bosses/managers don't give two shits about their employees beyond their legal obligations to them (even then, some don't care about those). This is doubly the case when it's a big corporation/chain place. Anyway this is irrelevant to the post at hand.", "NTA It was a request, not a summon", "NTA. Safety first.", "NTA. It's clear your brother has got your back and it sounds like his GF is just annoyed that she was slightly inconvenienced. Any beef she has with your brother's decisions should be taken up with him and not with you. \n\nHe made a choice when you called him; he could have told you no, but he didn't. She's upset that he made that choice to come and pick you up (which I'd argue is him being responsible and looking out for his sister) rather than deferring to her because it interrupted their time together.", "NTA. If I was the girlfriend and the brother refused to pick her up I would had picked her up myself. I would never leave a fellow girl in a very unsafe situation!!! After dropping her home we could continue the date.", "NTA. GF sounds jealous if you and that\u2019s weird. I know I\u2019d be proud if my significant other cared so much for his siblings that they turned to him for help.", "NTA sounds like your brother has a girlfriend problem and not in a good way", "NTA. Never think about another person\u2019s silly hurt feelings instead of your safety, always put your safety first. Imagine not asking your brother to pick you up and the God forbid, you get harassed or assaulted because you\u2019re trying not to cause too much trouble? Don\u2019t listen to her and always call your brother when you need him.", "NTA\n\nShe is in a relationship with your brother. If she doesn't like his priorities she needs to talk to him about it. Not bully you to silence so you wont ask for help from him anymore. \n\nYou simply asked for help not even knowing he was on a date, so how are you at fault in any way? And even if you knew it still would be all on him for making the decision to help you. Which was not a bad decision by the way.", "NTA and tell her to talk to your brother and leave you alone. Tell your brother to address his gf.", "NTA.  Your brother is a good egg.  The GF sounds like she\u2019ll be the ex gf soon enough, your 16 and your brother wants to keep you safe - she should be encouraging that, not causing issues.", "NTA. She had no business contacting you directly and trying to make you feel badly about the situation. If she has a problem with your brother leaving early she needs to take it up with him. I'm glad you have a brother who looks out for you.", "NTA and imo it's a little unhinged to text your BF's 16yr old sister bitching at her for asking for a ride. Your bro wants you to get rides from him and if he didn't he'd have just tried to get your dad to go.\n\nClearly his gf is mad at the wrong person anyways.", "NTA\nAnd your brother is so sweet & obviously cares about you. Listen to him!", "NTA - if the girlfriend really liked your brother, she should recognize his love for his family and how much he cares that you\u2019re safe. He immediately went to pick you up rather then you end up in a position that could be dangerous. She should admire that about your brother, not throw a fit that she isn\u2019t the center of attention at all times. She could have gone with him to asp spend time with you, to bond w his family. You\u2019re fine. She should not be coming at you for anything at all. This does not sound like a regular occurrence, lack of planning or laziness or something on your part.", "NTA", "NTA. What kind of a young woman wants a 16 year old girl stranded at night? That\u2019s not fine at all. You did the right thing calling your brother. There is no need to put yourself in unnecessary dangerous situations.", "\"You're just the stick she's using to beat him with.\" - So, so true but if gf isn't careful it's going to be the stick that breaks her relationship, and that won't be OP's fault either.", "Yes. The girlfriend is engaging in triangulation. The issue exists between her and the boyfriend, and she\u2019s trying to involve the sister as leverage to change the boyfriend\u2019s behavior.", "People can say things they don't really mean when they've got blue balls", "I used to spend time with my brother's girlfriend (now wife) like that and it was just a nice way to get to know each other a bit. Like, aren't you supposed to at least try to get along with your potential sister-in-law? Or like... at least not have an issue with your partner worrying about their sibling's safety?", "If she wasn\u2019t such a pain, they could have picked OP up together then went back to her place to finish the movie. She needs to grow up", "Sounds like she was mad he prioritized his sister over her. Some women cannot handle when their partner puts someone else before them, even for one night in a situation like this.", "How can you be mad at a teenage girl for needing her older brother to safely get home? Would the girlfriend be mad at herself for needing her boyfriend to pick her up at 10 pm? Would she pick any other option in that case because how could she ask this man for help when there are other options? I doubt it. They were just watching a movie while his sister needed help from her own brother, how can you be mad at someone who genuinely needs help?", "Ahahahahahahah"]}
