{"id": 4103, "submission_id": "ze71kn", "title": "AITA for telling my husband to stop buying board games?", "selftext": "My husband (23M) picked up the hobby of board games about 4 years ago. He has had hobbies before, and always has the mindset that he has to \"conquer\" it. He has to try it all. Previous ones have been teas, Ben and Jerry's flavors, hot sauces, etc. He keeps buying them until he can't find any ones he hasn't tried.\n\nWe got married in February of 2020 and conceived our first baby two months later. He was born December of 2020. We just had our second baby July of this year. We live in low income housing, have an application out for SNAP (food stamps), and are living paycheck to paycheck. He works while I (22F) stay home. \n\nHe works 11pm-7:30am, has family time from 8am-2pm, then sleeps from 2pm-10pm. The only \"free time\" he has is at work sometimes, it's an overnight job so it's pretty lax. He loads up some board games with him and will play them there, by himself. \n\nNow, the issue comes with him constantly wanting more. The beauty of board games is they can be played over and over again! Why does he need more? We CANNOT afford more games at $50+ a pop. \n\nHe has this idea of \"spending money.\" Every paycheck we are supposed to get spending money to buy whatever we want, his being board games. I handle finances. I have tried to make him understand we can't afford spending money. I have given him some, and none to myself, a few times to get him to be quiet about it and stop hassling me. But we just can't afford it. I have come close to needing to ask my father for a small loan to get bills paid recently.\n\nIs \"spending money\" a normal thing for adults? In my eyes, bills get paid, groceries get bought, and the rest goes into savings. Maybe a small amount saved for eating out or a family activity. I haven't bought something truly for myself in probably 2+ years. Everything that I buy that doesn't fall into those categories, is for the children or is something that is used by everybody. So why should he be spending so much money on board games that only he plays? Does he deserve it for being the working parent? Being a SAHM to two children under 2 years old isn't easy, not even a little bit, but I still don't think I need or deserve to be constantly spending money on things solely for myself. He asked me what I wanted for Christmas this year and I literally didn't have an answer, because I never think of only myself. I never do because I know we can't afford it. I need a new wardrobe after having two babies, but I know we can't afford it, though a clothing item is cheaper than board games.\n\nSorry this was so long.

Sure, there is such thing as fun/spending money. It comes after everything else has been paid. And if it's not in the budget, then he doesn't need to be buying toys for himself.

Respectfully, if you're already living in low income housing and need food stamps to be able to feed your kids, you really can't afford to be a SAHM. When you get a caseworker through welfare, they can help you sign up for (or point you in the direction of) childcare assistance. The rules vary from county to county and state to state but there are programs that give you a \"childcare voucher\" that can be used at daycare centers or even private in-home sitters where the state pays the majority of the cost. A second income would alleviate alot of the financial burden on your family, you could afford clothes and your husband could afford his hobby. Supporting 4 people on 1 income is very difficult and leaves little room for extra spending money. But hobbies and similar outlets are so important for mental health and avoiding burn out.

Don't do that to yourself! You deserve to have some special treats too. You certainly deserve clothes that fit! This is a situation where you need to sit down together and work out a budget, but in that budget you do need to carve out a little spending money for each of you.

But just like all other finances, this should be budgeted. \n\nHe may understand that finances are tight. However, since doesn't manage the finances he doesn't have any personal experience with money just not being there. \n\nMy fiance and I have this issue a lot. She doesn't want to be involved with our finances so while she understands money is tight she refuses to understand how tight. \n\nThe real problem though is her sense of financial priorities. She will try and skip necessities while buying frivolous crap. Or she will try and get me to buy things on sale because they're on sale we can save money even though we didn't need the item in the first place. She has a bad problem about getting fast food even though we have food at home. She also has a credit card that I'm helping her pay. She's supposed to tell me when the minimum amount due changes so I can adjust my payments accordingly. Well this last time she did not tell me and the minimum payment went up, she said she paid it from her bank on time. Well every time she does that she forgets that it takes a few days to process the payment so the payment was late. So they charged her a late fee, then interest charge. Then I made the next payment not knowing the minimum payment had changed again, so she got another late fee. And she doesn't seem to comprehend that the interest is always going to be charged to come on no matter how many times we discuss it, and that payments take a few days to process", "NTA but please stop have kids.", "Well he needs to have an idea of \"not spending money\".

There are way cheaper hobbies to explore if that's what he wants. Tell him to grow up. If you want to be an adult, act like one.", "ESH. You are not on the same page. He is not wrong for wanting to buy a board game given you can afford it and you don't seem to understand the concept of disposable income and \"fun money\".\n\nYou need to discuss together how much money you have, what you can afford and you should maybe work and stop pumping out kids when you're already on social services.", "Yes, \"spending money\" is a normal, adult,  thing. It's understandable that your husband wants to spend some money on his hobby. At the same time, when you only have one low income, \"spending money\" isn't going to be very much. So stopping buying boardgames for now isn't a bad idea. \n\nNAH.", "NTA - I totally get that your partner needs an outlet but he needs to find one which is financially sustainable for your family. A lot of libraries rent out board games these days - maybe he can look into that?", "ESH.  It is one thing to simply not *have* discretionary income (or spending money, or whatever you want to call it) beyond what\u2019s needed to pay the bills.

While it is normal for have a little bit of money to enjoy oneself, he needs to understand that hes spending far too much, especially with a wife and two kids. He might want to see a therapist about this because its sounding an awful lot like undiagnosed neuro diversity if not a full blown addiciton. There's nothing wrong with havimg a hobby, even if its something viewed as childish, but that cant take priority over one's family.", "NTA. I really wanted to vote that there's no AH here, but you're definitely not the AH, and he is only a little wrong, here's why:\n\n- You are definitely not the AH. As adults, and as parents, you guys need to both put needs first, definitely ahead of wants. Needs should be covered, savings should be accounted for, and then (and only then) should there be room for buying new games, hobbies, gadgets, etc. \n\n- He isn't an AH for having a hobby, and in fact, it's a lovely hobby to have. However, when you live in subsidised housing, are on foodstamps / welfare schemes, you can't be spending that kind of money on hobbies. If that's the mindset, you must deal with that by talking it through and explaining that while spending on hobbies is reasonable, it's not to keep buying expensive things while relying on welfare. That's a luxury that isn't something you guys can afford at the moment, not with the frequency he wants for now. \n\nIt's not like he can't keep buying board games later when you have more money and more savings, but just right now, he needs to learn to slow down on the buying until he isn't reliant on welfare to help support his family.", "NTA. You simply don't have the money to maintain this. Yes, people/families have \"spending money,\" but that presumes that all your basic needs are met first: food, shelter, utilities, transportation.\n\nI have not seen it mentioned here but these behaviors sound like they could be related to autism or OCD. My brother and daughter are autistic and have strong \"collecting\" tendencies. Consider getting a husband a diagnosis and help addressing this behavior. If he has trouble following a budget, that could be related to issues with executive functioning, which is also autism-related.", "NTA. \n\nIf you want to make things easier on yourselves, please develop a budget that you do TOGETHER.

If he and you all you do is work pay bills and save , you guys are gonna go crazy unless you are currently struggling there is no other choice i would advise against it. I personally save half my earning and after bills i have my spending money.", "NTA, it sounds like you guys need to have a very open conversation about finances and be realistic. Even if you handle finances he should know where you stand financially maybe an accessible list of income and bills you can check off what is payed and how much money is left. Spending money is definitely a thing but it\u2019s unfortunately a \u201cluxury\u201d when you are struggling to make ends meet. I would try to come to an agreement on how to divide whatever is left over. Maybe 80% goes to saving and 10% to each of you for spending on yourself so you both have the opportunity to save for something you want and agreement if your unable to make ends meet it comes 50/50 out of that first before savings or needing help from family.", "NTA.

In a poster-size sheet, list ALL the monthly expenses, including any that you might pay for quarterly or annually, show the total. Include how little you can put aside for emergency fund. In another column, list all necessities you both need to save up for  (the \"urgent $ goals\") like pending car repair/maintenance, nearing appliance replacement, nearing rent increase, etc. Nothing wakes you up like actually seeing where each dollar has to go and what needs to be paid.", "NTA about needing to spend within one\u2019s means, but spending money is actually a thing\u2026if you can afford it. He is missing that key piece. Folks who are fairly financially stable can pay the bills, buy food, save and still have some over for fun stuff whether it is eating out of buying items for a hobby. The amount depends entirely on how much money one has and needs for the nonnegotiables. When you say you handle the finances, have you still included him in the budgeting? To be honest, it sounds like he has a semi-addiction here, but on the off chance it is just ignorance, might be worth a try to sit him down with you to go over the math. Let him see income versus expenditures and talk about what you are saving for - are you making sure there is money for an emergency? If so how much before that is sufficient? Is it for retirement? If so, what\u2019s a good percentage that you both can feel comfortable with? And so on.", "NTA. You need to see a financial counselor to help y\u2019all figure out your finances.

Such as if everything that has to paid in the month has been paid and I have 100 extra, I put 50 in savings and then have 50 in spending money to do what I want with. It sucks.

Well, it depends on your budget. Most people who aren't on the breadline allocate some amount of money for leisure.

Work on it together. Break things down and see if anything is left over after you have all of the essentials.

If nothing is left over, then you don\u2019t have extra spending money for that month.", "NTA. You need to have your bills paid first. As far as spending money goes it's normal to have some to set aside for fun things rather than spending everything on necessities/savings. However, this is only done after bills and needs are met. Also if you are this close to the line of unpaid bills then you need to also account for paying your savings account as well \n\nYou may want to go back thru the budget and see if there is a small amount that can reasonably be set aside each paycheck, even if it's just $5. That can accumulate over 10 paychecks into a new game and will maybe stop some of the resentment that may happen from stopping fun money.

I get that that is easier said than done. It\u2019s not a short term solution. But if Mama can\u2019t afford clothes, this is not a sustainable situation either and the family has to find some way to bring in more income. I get that this doesn\u2019t happen overnight. Looking into government assistance (and I realize the options out there are typically scanty in the United States) or even one or both partners doing some paid part-time or freelance work could take some of the pressure off. I\u2019m not saying these things will necessarily work out for this family, but it makes sense to explore some different options. The problem isn\u2019t that the husband wants to spend money on things he enjoys that make his life better or that the wife is concerned about those things being too expensive. The problem is the poverty. No one is the asshole here, but I really hope that this family finds a way to give themselves more financial breathing room.", "Honestly, it's kind of a tricky situation since he's the one working and bringing in the money. I'd say it's his right to buy stuff for himself after working hard for that money, but it's also your right to make sure the basic needs of the family are taken care of before he goes into a shopping spree.\n\nSadly alot of people have addictions and compulsions, and it's really hard to stop an alcoholic from buying booze, a compulsive buyer from buying objects, etc... So you might have to confront him with the numbers and prove to him that it's not sustainable and he needs to slack down, maybe at least sell his old board games if he want to afford new ones and not just keep buying more and more each week.\n\nBut yeah, at the end of the day he's the one working and he should also be allowed to waste some of his salary on stuff that's important for him...

He has had hobbies before, and always has the mindset that he has to \"conquer\" it. He has to try it all. Previous ones have been teas, Ben and Jerry's flavors, hot sauces, etc. He keeps buying them until he can't find any ones he hasn't tried.\n\nWe got married in February of 2020 and conceived our first baby two months later. He was born December of 2020. We just had our second baby July of this year. We live in low income housing, have an application out for SNAP (food stamps), and are living paycheck to paycheck. He works while I (22F) stay home. \n\nHe works 11pm-7:30am, has family time from 8am-2pm, then sleeps from 2pm-10pm. The only \"free time\" he has is at work sometimes, it's an overnight job so it's pretty lax. He loads up some board games with him and will play them there, by himself. \n\nNow, the issue comes with him constantly wanting more. The beauty of board games is they can be played over and over again! Why does he need more? We CANNOT afford more games at $50+ a pop. \n\nHe has this idea of \"spending money.\" Every paycheck we are supposed to get spending money to buy whatever we want, his being board games. I handle finances. I have tried to make him understand we can't afford spending money. I have given him some, and none to myself, a few times to get him to be quiet about it and stop hassling me. But we just can't afford it. I have come close to needing to ask my father for a small loan to get bills paid recently.\n\nIs \"spending money\" a normal thing for adults? In my eyes, bills get paid, groceries get bought, and the rest goes into savings. Maybe a small amount saved for eating out or a family activity. I haven't bought something truly for myself in probably 2+ years. Everything that I buy that doesn't fall into those categories, is for the children or is something that is used by everybody. So why should he be spending so much money on board games that only he plays? Does he deserve it for being the working parent? Being a SAHM to two children under 2 years old isn't easy, not even a little bit, but I still don't think I need or deserve to be constantly spending money on things solely for myself. He asked me what I wanted for Christmas this year and I literally didn't have an answer, because I never think of only myself. I never do because I know we can't afford it. I need a new wardrobe after having two babies, but I know we can't afford it, though a clothing item is cheaper than board games.\n\nSorry this was so long.

We agreed to use what little \u201cfun money\u201d for memberships to local museums\u2014something that we could do as a family and I explained that he didn\u2019t need to buy us guilt presents. \n\nYou really just have to sit down with your husband and tell him to stop with the board games. Not everyone has fun money with each paycheck.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s being incredibly selfish. I bet he can find friends or people online to do like a boardgame exchange where they switch games for a little bit. That way he can try something new without spending money", "> everything they need\n\nExcept financial security and a mom that isn't being financially abused", "You're on food stamps, you can't even afford your children.\n\nWhy you have them doesn't matter because they're already here. What your husband absolutely does not understand is that when you're relying on other people to pay for your food, you absolutely should not be spending excessively on 'fun' things", "If you can\u2019t afford to treat yourselves, you can\u2019t afford kids. At the end of the day, kids are a luxury.", "Also how is he working 16 hours a day? \ud83d\ude02 family time is not work. He is happy with his sleep schedule. Also, he already has 100+ games. He can play the ones he already has.", "yes, I'll go get a job after sleeping an average of 4 hours a night. I'll be the best employee! \n\nAnd no, neither of us are having surgery to keep from having children. I've already been cut open twice to bring them into the world. And not that it's your business but we haven't even had sex since the time that we conceived our second child. \n\nPlus, my husband would rather I be the one to care for the kids even if it costs us a couple hundred extra a month. I am the \"primary parent\" as most mothers are. When I said \"family time\" I did not say that he was taking care of them on his own during that time. He wouldn't be able to.", "You think she\u2019s sleeping in like laying about relaxing?? She\u2019s sleeping \u201cin\u201d because she has 2 young kids and probably doesn\u2019t get a full night in very often.", "Did you do online school? If you did do you have a recommendation? I do have one year under my belt and additional credits. I would love to go to school if I didn't have to worry about the money. I was just telling my husband I've been doing math worksheets because I'm afraid of my brain turning to mush by being around kids all day lol.", "I definitely don't \ud83e\udd0d they are my pride and joy!", "I wasn't trying to argue, just making sure you understand the situation.\n\nI have stated numerous reasons why I am not able to work. If they don't make sense to you, or if you don't want to read them all, then sorry. \n\nI'm not complaining about finances. I'm complaining about him not understanding or them.", "None of his diagnoses are the reason for him not making phone calls, though. He simply doesn't like to. Neither do I but I do it when I need to for our family... He should too.", "My entire paycheck would cover the difference and we'd be in the same spot financially. So yes.", "He works in Behavioral Health so I feel like he knows all the coping skills \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d haha thank you! Solidarity sister!", "This is good advice. It doesn\u2019t always take money to play games and find some type of enjoyment or relaxation. Perhaps even writing new rules for the existing games might help? I don\u2019t game, but I\u2019m sure a rules system could be created and revised.\n\nAlso, I realize their situation is difficult, and a second job is possibly not in the cards at the moment, but a single income, paycheck-to-paycheck situation is one missed paycheck away from disaster. Accidents can and do happen. OP probably needs to at least self-educate or seek adult education classes to keep in the loop, so to speak. Employment can be difficult to obtain if you remain out of the workforce too long. Will probably be an unpopular range of opinions, but planning is better than remaining stagnate.", "We are not on food stamps", "Cool, your point is moot, the kids are here", "Agree to disagree I guess. I would rather give my children the world than do anything for myself. Plus, our children don't really have anything to do with this conversation. They're here, they're not going anywhere. We didn't have them on purpose.", ">He wouldn't be able to.\n\nThen he probably shouldn't have kids.  he is a parent, not a babysitter.\n\nMany many families have kids with both parents working. All I see from you are excuses.", "That\u2019s literally what most people do. They go to work on 2-4 hours of sleep. Because that is what you chose in having kids.\n\nYou are talking sarcastically about many of the employees you interact with daily. You make do. It\u2019s normal. You go to work on little to even no sleep, you do your best and fake smile and get the paycheck. Because you can\u2019t afford being a stay at home mom.\n\nAlso uhhhhh why couldn\u2019t your husband care for the children alone?? What??? There should never be a parent who can\u2019t care for their own children alone", "I absolutely don\u2019t think she\u2019s just relaxing. I think she\u2019s been working her ass off with the kids and is trying to take some time to actually close her eyes. I get that.\n\nI\u2019m just saying people do both. They suck it up when they are struggling bad. Most people I have met in any of my jobs are working on 2-4 hours of sleep. But when you have kids and need the money you need the money.\n\nAt my last job there was a 22 year old with one and a half year old triplets, and she was busy and tired as fuck but she knew she needed that money to give the best to her kids and she worked her ass off. And, being waitressing, that showed and resulted in good tips and her kids getting things they never could before.\n\nI\u2019m not saying she\u2019s not working her ass off or needs a full time job, but working is possible if there is not a serious health condition and it sounds needed.\n\nShe\u2019s still NTA her husband is unreasonable but come on", ">Did you do online school? \n\nNo, I went to a Big 10 and I have a STEM degree. Can't do labs on line for things like that.   \n\n\\> I would love to go to school if I didn't have to worry about the money. \n\nSince you've got credits and such already, it seems you'll likely get accepted for school, and while money is always something to be mindful about, the odds are more in your favor than you think. \n\nHere is my recommendation to you:\n\n1. Figure out a major that is in demand, that you would be interested in, AND is available at a college near you. Agriculture based degrees are big ones right now (especially since any ag degree with substitute for another easily). You just need to be willing to go to where the jobs are if they aren't local to you. Obviously go to community college to get your gen ed knocked out to lower costs, but make sure everything you take will line up and transfer. Mathematics and Statistics are also in demand for the record. Especially if you are interested in government work. \n2. Apply for that and all the scholarships and financial aid that you can. I have a degree in horticulture and because of the lack of students in that track right now, I was awarded every scholarship I was given. You'll also be eligible for the Pell grant. You will probably have to do student loans, however, if you have a degree track with a demand for grads and you take advantage of every form of assistance to you, you'd probably come out with a low amount in loans. A lot of scholarships are cash based so that makes it flexible on how you spend it. Just remember a degree is an investment. Some investments are good, some are bad. Choose wisely on what you dedicate your time and which one you buy money for to finance it. \n3. Once accepted, get on the school's wait list for daycare. How I would handle this is once I got my financial aid, I'd pay outright for child care for the entire semester along with rent. Now, I had the GI Bill, so things were much easier for me as I had dedicated income every month, but there are plenty of people who go to school with kids. They just treat it like a job. You can also get work study jobs where you can literally sit in an office and do homework as well. \n4. Arrange your schedule to fall in line with your kids in day care. Do homework between classes and find ways to get your internships in during that time. Especially during the summer. I never took summers off. I was attending class, doing required research courses, or working internships. \n\nYou can contact your local college and get more information from a counselor on what to do and how best to go about it. But the above is the general map of how to go about it. I just can't stress this enough: major in something IN DEMAND!!!! Do not try to be a teacher because you'll end up with a ton of debt for something that won't pay more than 15 an hour. Do NOT go into any medical field unless you want to hate your life and deal with the BS they are right now. A good gauge on it's demand is the amount of scholarships available as well as internships.", "Amazing to hear! I hope everything works out for you and your husband starts realizing that you have needs too and sometimes he can go without a new board game. Moms need clothes after kids especially loungewear like sweat pants and sweatshirts, or hell even a sexy outfit to surprise the hubby! Moms have needs too\u2764\ufe0f", "Those reason are far from sufficient. Part-time work exists. Even picking up 2 or 3 morning shifts at the local supermarket can do wonders for your situation.", "Honestly a majority of mental health conditions can affect talking on the phone, even if you or he doesn\u2019t realize that\u2019s the reason. If he has several diagnosis\u2019 it\u2019s likely they ARE actually involved.\n\nEven if they aren\u2019t, though, why wouldn\u2019t you just do it? Get your husband the help he obviously needs? It will likely help the life of your whole family.", "That\u2019s a pretty short term view. You realize you earn more money by gaining work experience. Even if you break even financially you\u2019re getting experience and building a career to earn more in the future.\n\nWhat exactly is your plan long term to get out of this cycle if you aren\u2019t willing to put in the work?", "But you have the application in...", "I second your opinion. OP is also incredibly young and is asking for advice. She is frustrated and obviously understands a solution is necessary.", "I feel bad for them that\u2019s all. I grew with poor parents and it\u2019s very traumatic.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re comments about not being able to work, you\u2019re lazy. I work nights and I work with a bunch of single mothers with kids. If they can do it so can you.", "You're right, neither of us should have had kids and if you would read my other comments you would see that we didn't mean to.\n\nHe is not capable of taking care of two babies alone after being awake all night. They give him a harder time than they do me. He is simply not capable of taking care of them by himself. \n\nYou're right, I have my reasonings, because like I said I have considered numerous times how I'd like to have a job. I've thought this all through many times before. \n\nI'm sorry you can't put yourself in my shoes and see that my reasonings are valid.", "Are you not able to read all of my comments? You should probably do that before responding.", "All of those reasons *are* for part time. I have not even considered full time. We would lose our house if we had any more income and would be even worse off. I understand the suggestions of just getting more money but it simply doesn't work that way", "Because I have done it numerous times before. I have called the doctor, they've sent me paperwork - then he never fills it out. Okay, so I fill out the paperwork. He never turns it in. Okay, so I turn it in! He doesn't go to his appointment. It's an endless cycle of him not being able to step up and get help. I have numerous mental conditions of my own and hate talking on the phone as well. However I did what I had to do to get myself into therapy. I do what I have to in order to get our kids the help they need. If we both have the same dislike, why am I the one to do it for both of us? We can't at least just do it for ourselves? Again, I have done it for him before, but I'm trying to get him to do it himself for once.", "My plan has always been to work when the children go to school.", "Yes.. and if we were to get it, we would be much better off financially.", "Why? To just throw the majority of that income into childcare and transportation to and from work? For what actual benefit? Just to assure people she is working? \n\nIf these were kinds in school, ok.

Maybe it\u2019s time for a serious talk that you can\u2019t mentally and emotionally handle this anymore and it is not a suggestion, it is a requirement for you and the family for him to get help?
