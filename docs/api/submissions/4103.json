{"id": 4103, "submission_id": "ze71kn", "title": "AITA for telling my husband to stop buying board games?", "selftext": "My husband (23M) picked up the hobby of board games about 4 years ago. He has had hobbies before, and always has the mindset that he has to \"conquer\" it. He has to try it all. Previous ones have been teas, Ben and Jerry's flavors, hot sauces, etc. He keeps buying them until he can't find any ones he hasn't tried.\n\nWe got married in February of 2020 and conceived our first baby two months later. He was born December of 2020. We just had our second baby July of this year. We live in low income housing, have an application out for SNAP (food stamps), and are living paycheck to paycheck. He works while I (22F) stay home. \n\nHe works 11pm-7:30am, has family time from 8am-2pm, then sleeps from 2pm-10pm. The only \"free time\" he has is at work sometimes, it's an overnight job so it's pretty lax. He loads up some board games with him and will play them there, by himself. \n\nNow, the issue comes with him constantly wanting more. The beauty of board games is they can be played over and over again! Why does he need more? We CANNOT afford more games at $50+ a pop. \n\nHe has this idea of \"spending money.\" Every paycheck we are supposed to get spending money to buy whatever we want, his being board games. I handle finances. I have tried to make him understand we can't afford spending money. I have given him some, and none to myself, a few times to get him to be quiet about it and stop hassling me. But we just can't afford it. I have come close to needing to ask my father for a small loan to get bills paid recently.\n\nIs \"spending money\" a normal thing for adults? In my eyes, bills get paid, groceries get bought, and the rest goes into savings. Maybe a small amount saved for eating out or a family activity. I haven't bought something truly for myself in probably 2+ years. Everything that I buy that doesn't fall into those categories, is for the children or is something that is used by everybody. So why should he be spending so much money on board games that only he plays? Does he deserve it for being the working parent? Being a SAHM to two children under 2 years old isn't easy, not even a little bit, but I still don't think I need or deserve to be constantly spending money on things solely for myself. He asked me what I wanted for Christmas this year and I literally didn't have an answer, because I never think of only myself. I never do because I know we can't afford it. I need a new wardrobe after having two babies, but I know we can't afford it, though a clothing item is cheaper than board games.\n\nSorry this was so long.

Sure, there is such thing as fun/spending money. It comes after everything else has been paid. And if it's not in the budget, then he doesn't need to be buying toys for himself. Maybe he needs to get a more ambitious and better paying job if he wants to spend more money on useless junk.", "NTA, you two clearly can't afford this hobby,  and tbh he sounds manic.

Respectfully, if you're already living in low income housing and need food stamps to be able to feed your kids, you really can't afford to be a SAHM. When you get a caseworker through welfare, they can help you sign up for (or point you in the direction of) childcare assistance. The rules vary from county to county and state to state but there are programs that give you a \"childcare voucher\" that can be used at daycare centers or even private in-home sitters where the state pays the majority of the cost. A second income would alleviate alot of the financial burden on your family, you could afford clothes and your husband could afford his hobby. Supporting 4 people on 1 income is very difficult and leaves little room for extra spending money. But hobbies and similar outlets are so important for mental health and avoiding burn out. Also, why are the games costing him so much money? If he just wants to have/play all the games, it seems it would be much more cost effective to buy them used on ebay or at thrift stores.", "Esh. \n\nYou because you don't think you guys should treat yourselves.

Yes, he is the one working for the money, but you are staying home and taking care of your children, which is also like a full-time job at their age.  \n\nLiving paycheck to paycheck is not ideal, especially when you have children. Having an unexpected expense come up, such as a car breaking down, medical bills, etc. can really put you in a tough spot so it's best to have some money saved up if you are able in case these things happen. \n\nYou mentioned that you may need to ask your father for a loan to pay your bills.

Don't do that to yourself! You deserve to have some special treats too. You certainly deserve clothes that fit! This is a situation where you need to sit down together and work out a budget, but in that budget you do need to carve out a little spending money for each of you.

But just like all other finances, this should be budgeted. \n\nHe may understand that finances are tight. However, since doesn't manage the finances he doesn't have any personal experience with money just not being there. \n\nMy fiance and I have this issue a lot. She doesn't want to be involved with our finances so while she understands money is tight she refuses to understand how tight. \n\nThe real problem though is her sense of financial priorities. She will try and skip necessities while buying frivolous crap. Or she will try and get me to buy things on sale because they're on sale we can save money even though we didn't need the item in the first place. She has a bad problem about getting fast food even though we have food at home. She also has a credit card that I'm helping her pay. She's supposed to tell me when the minimum amount due changes so I can adjust my payments accordingly. Well this last time she did not tell me and the minimum payment went up, she said she paid it from her bank on time. Well every time she does that she forgets that it takes a few days to process the payment so the payment was late. So they charged her a late fee, then interest charge. Then I made the next payment not knowing the minimum payment had changed again, so she got another late fee. And she doesn't seem to comprehend that the interest is always going to be charged to come on no matter how many times we discuss it, and that payments take a few days to process", "NTA but please stop have kids.", "Well he needs to have an idea of \"not spending money\".

There are way cheaper hobbies to explore if that's what he wants. Tell him to grow up. If you want to be an adult, act like one.", "ESH. You are not on the same page. He is not wrong for wanting to buy a board game given you can afford it and you don't seem to understand the concept of disposable income and \"fun money\".\n\nYou need to discuss together how much money you have, what you can afford and you should maybe work and stop pumping out kids when you're already on social services.", "Yes, \"spending money\" is a normal, adult,  thing. It's understandable that your husband wants to spend some money on his hobby. At the same time, when you only have one low income, \"spending money\" isn't going to be very much. So stopping buying boardgames for now isn't a bad idea. \n\nNAH.", "NTA - I totally get that your partner needs an outlet but he needs to find one which is financially sustainable for your family. A lot of libraries rent out board games these days - maybe he can look into that?", "ESH.  It is one thing to simply not *have* discretionary income (or spending money, or whatever you want to call it) beyond what\u2019s needed to pay the bills.

While it is normal for have a little bit of money to enjoy oneself, he needs to understand that hes spending far too much, especially with a wife and two kids. He might want to see a therapist about this because its sounding an awful lot like undiagnosed neuro diversity if not a full blown addiciton. There's nothing wrong with havimg a hobby, even if its something viewed as childish, but that cant take priority over one's family.", "NTA. I really wanted to vote that there's no AH here, but you're definitely not the AH, and he is only a little wrong, here's why:\n\n- You are definitely not the AH. As adults, and as parents, you guys need to both put needs first, definitely ahead of wants. Needs should be covered, savings should be accounted for, and then (and only then) should there be room for buying new games, hobbies, gadgets, etc. \n\n- He isn't an AH for having a hobby, and in fact, it's a lovely hobby to have. However, when you live in subsidised housing, are on foodstamps / welfare schemes, you can't be spending that kind of money on hobbies. If that's the mindset, you must deal with that by talking it through and explaining that while spending on hobbies is reasonable, it's not to keep buying expensive things while relying on welfare. That's a luxury that isn't something you guys can afford at the moment, not with the frequency he wants for now. \n\nIt's not like he can't keep buying board games later when you have more money and more savings, but just right now, he needs to learn to slow down on the buying until he isn't reliant on welfare to help support his family.", "NTA. You simply don't have the money to maintain this. Yes, people/families have \"spending money,\" but that presumes that all your basic needs are met first: food, shelter, utilities, transportation.\n\nI have not seen it mentioned here but these behaviors sound like they could be related to autism or OCD. My brother and daughter are autistic and have strong \"collecting\" tendencies. Consider getting a husband a diagnosis and help addressing this behavior. If he has trouble following a budget, that could be related to issues with executive functioning, which is also autism-related.", "NTA. \n\nIf you want to make things easier on yourselves, please develop a budget that you do TOGETHER.

If he and you all you do is work pay bills and save , you guys are gonna go crazy unless you are currently struggling there is no other choice i would advise against it. I personally save half my earning and after bills i have my spending money.", "NTA, it sounds like you guys need to have a very open conversation about finances and be realistic. Even if you handle finances he should know where you stand financially maybe an accessible list of income and bills you can check off what is payed and how much money is left. Spending money is definitely a thing but it\u2019s unfortunately a \u201cluxury\u201d when you are struggling to make ends meet. I would try to come to an agreement on how to divide whatever is left over. Maybe 80% goes to saving and 10% to each of you for spending on yourself so you both have the opportunity to save for something you want and agreement if your unable to make ends meet it comes 50/50 out of that first before savings or needing help from family.", "NTA.

In a poster-size sheet, list ALL the monthly expenses, including any that you might pay for quarterly or annually, show the total. Include how little you can put aside for emergency fund. In another column, list all necessities you both need to save up for  (the \"urgent $ goals\") like pending car repair/maintenance, nearing appliance replacement, nearing rent increase, etc. Nothing wakes you up like actually seeing where each dollar has to go and what needs to be paid.", "NTA about needing to spend within one\u2019s means, but spending money is actually a thing\u2026if you can afford it. He is missing that key piece. Folks who are fairly financially stable can pay the bills, buy food, save and still have some over for fun stuff whether it is eating out of buying items for a hobby. The amount depends entirely on how much money one has and needs for the nonnegotiables. When you say you handle the finances, have you still included him in the budgeting? To be honest, it sounds like he has a semi-addiction here, but on the off chance it is just ignorance, might be worth a try to sit him down with you to go over the math. Let him see income versus expenditures and talk about what you are saving for - are you making sure there is money for an emergency? If so how much before that is sufficient? Is it for retirement? If so, what\u2019s a good percentage that you both can feel comfortable with? And so on.", "NTA. You need to see a financial counselor to help y\u2019all figure out your finances.

Such as if everything that has to paid in the month has been paid and I have 100 extra, I put 50 in savings and then have 50 in spending money to do what I want with. It sucks.

Well, it depends on your budget. Most people who aren't on the breadline allocate some amount of money for leisure.

Work on it together. Break things down and see if anything is left over after you have all of the essentials.

As far as spending money goes it's normal to have some to set aside for fun things rather than spending everything on necessities/savings. However, this is only done after bills and needs are met. Also if you are this close to the line of unpaid bills then you need to also account for paying your savings account as well \n\nYou may want to go back thru the budget and see if there is a small amount that can reasonably be set aside each paycheck, even if it's just $5. That can accumulate over 10 paychecks into a new game and will maybe stop some of the resentment that may happen from stopping fun money.

I get that that is easier said than done. It\u2019s not a short term solution. But if Mama can\u2019t afford clothes, this is not a sustainable situation either and the family has to find some way to bring in more income. I get that this doesn\u2019t happen overnight. Looking into government assistance (and I realize the options out there are typically scanty in the United States) or even one or both partners doing some paid part-time or freelance work could take some of the pressure off. I\u2019m not saying these things will necessarily work out for this family, but it makes sense to explore some different options. The problem isn\u2019t that the husband wants to spend money on things he enjoys that make his life better or that the wife is concerned about those things being too expensive. The problem is the poverty. No one is the asshole here, but I really hope that this family finds a way to give themselves more financial breathing room.", "Honestly, it's kind of a tricky situation since he's the one working and bringing in the money. I'd say it's his right to buy stuff for himself after working hard for that money, but it's also your right to make sure the basic needs of the family are taken care of before he goes into a shopping spree.\n\nSadly alot of people have addictions and compulsions, and it's really hard to stop an alcoholic from buying booze, a compulsive buyer from buying objects, etc... So you might have to confront him with the numbers and prove to him that it's not sustainable and he needs to slack down, maybe at least sell his old board games if he want to afford new ones and not just keep buying more and more each week.\n\nBut yeah, at the end of the day he's the one working and he should also be allowed to waste some of his salary on stuff that's important for him...

He has had hobbies before, and always has the mindset that he has to \"conquer\" it. He has to try it all. Previous ones have been teas, Ben and Jerry's flavors, hot sauces, etc. He keeps buying them until he can't find any ones he hasn't tried.\n\nWe got married in February of 2020 and conceived our first baby two months later. He was born December of 2020. We just had our second baby July of this year. We live in low income housing, have an application out for SNAP (food stamps), and are living paycheck to paycheck. He works while I (22F) stay home. \n\nHe works 11pm-7:30am, has family time from 8am-2pm, then sleeps from 2pm-10pm. The only \"free time\" he has is at work sometimes, it's an overnight job so it's pretty lax. He loads up some board games with him and will play them there, by himself. \n\nNow, the issue comes with him constantly wanting more. The beauty of board games is they can be played over and over again! Why does he need more? We CANNOT afford more games at $50+ a pop. \n\nHe has this idea of \"spending money.\" Every paycheck we are supposed to get spending money to buy whatever we want, his being board games. I handle finances. I have tried to make him understand we can't afford spending money. I have given him some, and none to myself, a few times to get him to be quiet about it and stop hassling me. But we just can't afford it. I have come close to needing to ask my father for a small loan to get bills paid recently.\n\nIs \"spending money\" a normal thing for adults? In my eyes, bills get paid, groceries get bought, and the rest goes into savings. Maybe a small amount saved for eating out or a family activity. I haven't bought something truly for myself in probably 2+ years. Everything that I buy that doesn't fall into those categories, is for the children or is something that is used by everybody. So why should he be spending so much money on board games that only he plays? Does he deserve it for being the working parent? Being a SAHM to two children under 2 years old isn't easy, not even a little bit, but I still don't think I need or deserve to be constantly spending money on things solely for myself. He asked me what I wanted for Christmas this year and I literally didn't have an answer, because I never think of only myself. I never do because I know we can't afford it. I need a new wardrobe after having two babies, but I know we can't afford it, though a clothing item is cheaper than board games.\n\nSorry this was so long.

Can't do labs on line for things like that.   \n\n\\> I would love to go to school if I didn't have to worry about the money. \n\nSince you've got credits and such already, it seems you'll likely get accepted for school, and while money is always something to be mindful about, the odds are more in your favor than you think. \n\nHere is my recommendation to you:\n\n1. Figure out a major that is in demand, that you would be interested in, AND is available at a college near you. Agriculture based degrees are big ones right now (especially since any ag degree with substitute for another easily). You just need to be willing to go to where the jobs are if they aren't local to you. Obviously go to community college to get your gen ed knocked out to lower costs, but make sure everything you take will line up and transfer. Mathematics and Statistics are also in demand for the record. Especially if you are interested in government work. \n2. Apply for that and all the scholarships and financial aid that you can. I have a degree in horticulture and because of the lack of students in that track right now, I was awarded every scholarship I was given. You'll also be eligible for the Pell grant. You will probably have to do student loans, however, if you have a degree track with a demand for grads and you take advantage of every form of assistance to you, you'd probably come out with a low amount in loans. A lot of scholarships are cash based so that makes it flexible on how you spend it. Just remember a degree is an investment. Some investments are good, some are bad. Choose wisely on what you dedicate your time and which one you buy money for to finance it. \n3. Once accepted, get on the school's wait list for daycare. How I would handle this is once I got my financial aid, I'd pay outright for child care for the entire semester along with rent. Now, I had the GI Bill, so things were much easier for me as I had dedicated income every month, but there are plenty of people who go to school with kids. They just treat it like a job. You can also get work study jobs where you can literally sit in an office and do homework as well. \n4. Arrange your schedule to fall in line with your kids in day care. Do homework between classes and find ways to get your internships in during that time. Especially during the summer. I never took summers off. I was attending class, doing required research courses, or working internships. \n\nYou can contact your local college and get more information from a counselor on what to do and how best to go about it. But the above is the general map of how to go about it. I just can't stress this enough: major in something IN DEMAND!!!! Do not try to be a teacher because you'll end up with a ton of debt for something that won't pay more than 15 an hour. Do NOT go into any medical field unless you want to hate your life and deal with the BS they are right now. A good gauge on it's demand is the amount of scholarships available as well as internships.", "Amazing to hear!

In my opinion life supporting income is everything you need to survive - rent/mortgage, electricity, water, food, essential clothing, saving (where possible) for emergencies (car trouble etc). I would personally argue that items such as Netflix should come from the disposable income element on one's pay check.\n\nAdditionally, since you don't work, your disposable income should be split equally between you and your husband. \nYou need to sit your husband down and have a serious conversation about his spending. You need to sit down and work out every element of your monthly costs and what is left could be counted as disposable income.

Spending money is a normal adult budget line and it should be a normal part of your budget as much as possible. Otherwise you\u2019re working non-stop with no reward or joy in return. But bear in mind, a good portion of adults use their spending money budget on things like alcohol, fancy coffees  or boba tea where I live or getting nails done etc. \n\nIf you don\u2019t budget in spending money what often happens is what you have going on - him spending with no concept of budget, things getting super tight, that feeling super stressful, then a burst of spending. It makes MUCH more sense to add spending to your budget - whatever you can afford - and then he knows what he has and he has to save his spending to get a new game. And you definitely need the equal amount. You also need a budget so he knows his board game funds are also his alcohol/fancy snacks, eating out, etc\u2026 fund. \n\nWhat I would do is have someone watch your kiddo for a few hours, and then sit down with him and go over your budget. Tell him that you are gently struggling because the spending money isn\u2019t actually being budgeted for so the two of you are going to look at the actual bills and the actual income and make decisions together about what money goes where, how much can reasonably be diverted to spending money and what might have to be given up to make that happen. Then do that. Layout the whole budget together, even if you manage finances he needs to know what that actually looks like (if for no other reason than to stop his over spending). \n\nI also have some advice as a board gamer who is married to an avid collector and likes to try new things\u2026 first: he\u2019s never going to get to try *everything* it\u2019s both financially and logistically impossible. At this point one of our things is to ask: what does it do that the games were already have don\u2019t do? Am I willing to get rid of an overlapping game in order to be able to aid this one? Also, Tom from the Dice Tower has long had a rule that his personal collection space can only hold so much, and now that it\u2019s full of a new game comes in an old one has to go out. Which might work for your house too. \n\nBut there are ways your husband can try all the things without irresponsibly breaking the bank. \n\n1. Board Game Arena and Tabletopia - these are digital platforms that host a bunch of board games, often have the new and upcoming ones (it\u2019s a great way for designers to get feedback) and both have pretty big menus of free to address games, but either of them is about $5/mnth to join if you really want the paid access games. This allows for a LOT of play for little output. \n\n2. Apps - still a financial expenditure but most app versions of the board games cost from $8-$14, have the exact same play but often with cool animations, allow him to play on his own or with others. A lot of the big money games (like Gloomhaven) have app or Steam versions. \n\n3. Have him look for games from stores that sell second hand first. Noble Knight games in the US and Board Game Bliss in Canada comes to mind. Again, still using spending money but saving a ton. \n\n3b. Thrift stores. These are hit and miss, but we\u2019ve found some great steals and when we don\u2019t want the hassle of reselling our games we do them at the thrift store. \n\n4. Board Game Geek /Marketplace - also a source of used games which he can use to shop, but should also use to sell his games he\u2019s not playing as much to fund the new games. BGG also does swaps, where you can note in your collection games you are willing to trade and games you\u2019d like to trade for, but they also do math trades and themed and seasonal swaps too. \n\n5. Board Game Cafes or Board Game Groups - are great ways to access a TON of games - particularly hard to find and out of print ones - for a minimal cost ($5-10 per person)", "There's an online service called board game arena that has a paid version but also has a free version with slightly less games available.
