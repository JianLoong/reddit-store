Because you are an adult. \n\nI can't even believe you need to hear this from others...", "NTA *however* you may be using the wrong approach when talking to your mom about your concerns. When you start a conversation by complaining, it automatically puts the person you are complaining to on the defense. In your mom\u2019s eyes, she probably views your complaints as being ungrateful and exaggerative and whining automatically devalues your opinion and cements (in her mind) that you are, in fact, a child. Try a new strategy since this one is clearly not working.\n\nActually sit her down and start with a request that she just hears you out. Preface the conversation by explaining that you love her and you aren\u2019t attacking her but X, Y, Z are the reasons you no longer enjoy Thanksgiving. It doesn\u2019t sound like the majority of these issues are your mom\u2019s fault, so just tell her you are confiding in her because she\u2019s your mom and you know she\u2019ll understand. When you reframe the way you approach someone, it\u2019s *amazing* how much they are more likely to both listen and understand. Emphasize that your desire to boycott has nothing to do with not loving her but everything to do with not feeling respected as an independent adult. \n\nRemember: the biggest problem with communication is the assumption that it happened in the first place. \n\nChange your approach and you may be surprised how your mom\u2019s reaction might change.\n\nNTA.", "Age please.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Take lots of pictures and post on Insta.  NTA", "NTA, \n\nit is an absolute Wonderful idea from your boyfriend!  Also very normal to visit the inlaws, especially as you're no child anymore. \n\nHave a great time!", "NTA\n\nYou told her your complaints. This is not fun or a good time for you. You are 22 years old being sat at the kids table. They are not even enjoying your company- the kids are. You are in your rights to go somewhere where you will not be used for free childcare", "NTA, her reaction clearly showed, that you are only there to be a babysitter for free. You are 22 and clearly dont have to sit at a children table.", "NTA\n\nIf for some reason you decide to go to your family's for Thanksgiving, get tipsy/drunk", "NTA. They are clearly using you. It's also pretty degrading to still be stuck at the children's table as an adult. I wouldn't worry about their response to this. You have already said something on repeat, they are choosing not to listen. Have fun at the other gathering!", "NTA. Besides being too old to sit at the kids table (unless you wanted to). People spend thanksgiving with their in-laws all the time. Presumably that\u2019s what your cousins\u2019 spouses are doing. You don\u2019t have to be married to spend thanksgiving with your SO\u2019s family.", "Next year turn up to dinner already drunk and rowdy.", "NTA. Enjoy your thanksgiving with your boyfriend. I hope one of the kids shits all over your aunts house.", "I hope you\u2019ll give us an update. :)", "Your mom had it coming, especially your freeloading relatives.", "NTA. It won\u2019t break her heart. She\u2019s just being a melodramatic whiner. Did she expect you\u2019d never get a partner and never go to a holiday with them. Time to train your family to behave themselves. Start by going to a Thanksgiving where you can enjoy yourself.", "NTA, you should be able to enjoy Thanksgiving too. Enjoy it with bf.", "NTA. They are only upset that they can\u2019t enjoy their largely kid free holiday because you\u2019ve been the free babysitter. Enjoy a relaxing thanksgiving at your bfs and take a nice dessert or bottle of wine as a gift. Also, I\u2019d recommend silencing your phone that day.", "INFO\n\nWhat would happen if you just refused to help the kids? Or asked for a seat at the adults table?", "NTA. Being blunt, I am willing to bet they are more going to miss that you are there to watch their kids, not actually your presence.\n\nThey still treat you like a kid and are viewing you as free labor so the \u201cadults\u201d don\u2019t have to take responsibility. Go to your boyfriend\u2019s house and have a great time!", "NTA - Yeah, everyone will miss the free babysitter that they have for the day. That's really what she means. You shouldn't be stuck having a bad Thanksgiving so everyone else can have a good time. And they sit you at the kids table and you are 22!!! No, fuck that. If they truly wanted you there they would have respected you. Tell your mom if it was going to break her heart so much to not have you there she would have listened to your YEARS of telling her that you were unhappy with spending your whole Thanksgiving day being a baby sitter while also being treated like a child.", "NTA. Glad you have another and better option.  She's mad because she doesn't have a built in babysitter.", "NTA. If they were actually going to miss **you** and not having a babysitter, you'd feel more included by now. Enjoy the time with your boyfriend's family.", "NTA\n\nI have done childcare for large family groups like that, because my cousins were close emotionally if not in age.  Watching 6 to 12 kids, ages newborn to 10 was exhausting.  I could do it because they all knew me, liked me, and had their parents around as backup if I had something like three kids needing help at the same time, but it was still LOTS of work.\n\nIt was worth it, because I liked the kids and their parents.  Still do, now that they're all adorably angsty teenagers..\n\nBut... If I felt taken advantage of?  I would not have gone.", "NTA. Your family uses you. They can take care of their own kids this year. Enjoy your Thanksgiving!", "NTA - and good for you. There is absolutely no reason why you need to keep being the forced, unpaid babysitter while everyone else has their fun. Your mother had years to make this right and never bothered. Go to your bf\u2019s Thanksgiving guilt-free and enjoy!", "NTA. Enjoy yourself. You\u2019re not a free babysitter.

Your mom is flipping out because now all the kids will be loose in her house without an adult watching them.", "NTA\n\nIf the parents want a day off they can hire a babysitter.", "NTA. They dont miss you at the grownup table, they can miss their free babysitter.", "Reading this, made me think you are like 16-17. But you are 22 and still made to sit with kids. Eh fuck that noise. \nNTA. Go have fun with your bf! Fell no guilt or anything. Let them deal with their children.", "NTA. Your family used you for years. Your mother was complicit in that. They never thought about allowing you to enjoy Thanksgiving. You're an adult now; it's time to enjoy your holidays with people who actually want to spend them with you.", "NTA, your family has been taking advantage of you for years. At 22, you should have been at the adult table for years while the parents rotate at the kids table. Enjoy Thanksgiving with your BF\u2019s family!", "NTA Your mom is right. Everyone is going to miss you... when they have to watch their own kids. You deserve have fun and relax on the holiday, too. Go enjoy the day with your boyfriend and his family.", "NTA did you even get to visit with the adults for them to miss you or will they miss pawning their kids off on you? \n\nEnjoy your thanksgiving at your bfs house!", "NTA do this one thing for yourself. Let them see how they take you for granted.\n\nAt 18 you should never have accepted the excuses of being told to sit at the kids table. You should have just walked out and gone back home.\n\nNext year they can invite you as one of them or you wont go either. Stay firm.", "NTA. Pretty clear cut with the free babysitting", "She isn't upset that their previous little girl is going to be there, is that their free babysitter isn't going to be available and the parents are going to have to be parents", "THIS. And  your 22 and still sitting at the kids table? I thought you'd be like 16 or something and still would've been 100% on your side. Girl, enjoy thanksgiving with your boyfriend's family, unless mom and relatives finally treat you with some respect.", "\"Everyone will miss you!\" Yeah because you take care of their kids while they get drunk.  No way in hell I'd be sitting at the kiddies table at 22 years of age.  Watch your own damn kids.", "If you do break down and go to your family's Thanksgiving, go grab a bag of discounted Halloween candy right now. Take this bag of Halloween candy with you, and be sure to stuff every single child full of that candy.", "Yeah, reading it I was guessing a 15/16 year old. Should have opted out of this years ago.", "To be fair, I\u2019m 36 and still at the \u201ckids table\u201d (AKA the couch). It depends on the family. Every at the adults table is like over 60 right now.", "PLEASE propose this.", "THIS IS THE WAY.  Time to put your foot down and glad your doing so OP. As they say you teach people how to treat you...", "It's not a big deal for *them*, mom included. OP tried talking to mom but she didn't want to hear it when it didn't impact her personally. I also hope OP gets to enjoy Thanksgiving this year.", "Right. This statement is a backhanded acknowledgement that your mom knows you've been relegated to babysitter all these years. And has been just fine with it.", "\"Had the best Thanksgiving ever with [OP Boyfriend], maybe all holidays should be like this!\"", "What do you want to bet that, with OP absent, the cousins draft the oldest of the remaining kids to be the new babysitter.", "I\u2019m 22", "I was going to tell her the same thing enjoy Thanksgiving with her boyfriend  and  her mom and her family can go eat sand", "She has already told her mother that before and got dismissed. Telling her again won\u2019t change anything.", "> Explain to your mom what you said here.\n\nIt would be much more beneficial and productive to explain OP to a wall. At least the wall will not try to guilt trip.", "Right? Sounds like she is not getting to spend any time with the grownups when she is there. They won't miss her, just the services she provides.", "I was looking for this comment! \n\nGo, enjoy your thanksgiving, and next year charge a rate to watch all the kids or do your own thing again.", "This is the way", "The same in my family. \n\nNTA", "Depends how big your setup is and how many people are in attendance.\n\nI have a big family. I was at the kids table until I was in my late 20s. My older cousins were there until their late 30s/early 40s. It became a huge joke in the family referring to it as the \"kids table.\"\n\nBut nobody ever dumped the kids on anyone. Each family took care of their own children and we all had a great time.", "Sounds like it isn't siblings, but cousin's kids (first cousins once removed?). They are going to aunt's house. So these may not even be kids they know that well.", "Op is 22. She does Not need to be negotiating with her Mom about the kids table. She needs to go to her boyfriends Thanksgiving and enjoy herself. Declare Independence and go LC if she needs to.", "Why, would this suddenly be okay if OP was under 18?", "22", "And make a comment about how wonderful it was to sit at the adult table and not have to babysit!", "I was expecting 15 or 16 based on the situation. Being treated as a babysitter and sat at the kids table at 22? Absolutely not. That situatuon wouldn't be okay at any age, but it makes it way worse. NTA. Go to your boyfriends.", "Have  Thanksgiving  with your boyfriend okay you nta  and Happy Thanksgiving \ud83d\ude0a.", "iT\u2019s nOt LiKe tHaT!!", "Right!? \n\nThis IS the best way to let them know. Besides, argument or not, OP is a 22 yr old grown ass woman, with a life of her own. And spending time with her bf's parents is important too. \n\nMaybe mom can offer to babysit. She has no little childen either (OP being youngest cousin) and well... It's *iMpORtanT* for the parents to get some time off. \n\nIf mom likes it, she can keep doing it. If not, she owes OP an apollogy.", "I disagree. Saying that is why she won't be coming to Thanksgiving instead of it being a general complaint may make more of an impression. Doesn't hurt to try.", "Yeah I feel for OP. I was the default babysitter a lot too.", "The idea of segregating the children from the rest of the family for dinner just doesn't sit right with me. No matter how many aunts, uncles, cousins, exc; we somehow always made room for everyone at one table. That's a family. Having the children sit at their own table is like saying they're not really part of the family.", "I sat at kids table even after I had kids.  I didn't think it was fair that my older neices and nephews should have to watch my kids. \n\nTo this day, my nieces and nephews like me best of all cause I was the cool auntie who alway sat with them.", "Yeah FUCK COMMUNICATION!! Let\u2019s burn this house to the ground!! Good, healthy choice! Lol I fucking love this sub. People just demanding you go NC over a quick snap picture into the whole picture. Lmfao, you guys crack me up.", "I didn\u2019t say it would be okay. I was trying to ascertain if the OP was old enough to drive or take public transportation. In other words, no one would be able to stop her from going to the BF\u2019s house. Geez\u2026", "NTA. Wow, way past the time to sit at the adult table. In fact, you are old enough to even have your own Thanksgiving. Sorry you\u2019ve been treated so poorly all these years. Have a great Thanksgiving with your bf and his family. Good luck to you.", "Then mom will promise it won\u2019t be that way this year, only to end up in exactly the same situation once she is there and has turned down BF\u2019s invitation. It couldn\u2019t be more obvious based on how Mom responded to the situation.", "Depending on your space, the kids table can be in the same area. As someone who had this on family holidays, I enjoyed it when I was a kid. The kids got to hang out and chatter, instead of sitting amongst adults and being bored. Also, in our family at least, it\u2019s not like we were banished or couldn\u2019t interact with the adults. There was talk going back and forth. We were just physically seated at a separate table. It does make for some awkwardness as some age out of the kids table.", "Or saying that kids enjoy visiting with their cousins and being able to talk about their favorite games or TV shows or whatever and respecting that they might enjoy their own space. \n\n\nMy family never had a kids table, because it was usually just me and my brothers as kids. But it isn't always about banishing the kids and saying they aren't part of the family.", "It was a fair question because if she was a minor her mom could in fact force her to go I get why you asked", "https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.huffpost.com/entry/kids-table-thanksgiving_n_5bec8a39e4b0dbb7ea66c5e4/amp", "Thanks for not assuming nonsense like the other commenter. And yes, that was my exact train of thought.", "That looks like an opinion piece that doesn't take into any consideration of specific families. \n\n\nWatching football is a tradition that should stay? So....watching people get paid millions of dollars to get permanent brain damage? Totally important. Letting some 10 year olds talk to their cousins that they only see every few months about school and video games at a smaller table with some privacy from adults? Nope, must be banished. \n\n\n\nNo, 25 year olds who are unmarried aren't the same as 6 year olds. That's a different issue."]}
