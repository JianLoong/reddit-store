Because you are an adult. \n\nI can't even believe you need to hear this from others...", "NTA *however* you may be using the wrong approach when talking to your mom about your concerns. When you start a conversation by complaining, it automatically puts the person you are complaining to on the defense. In your mom\u2019s eyes, she probably views your complaints as being ungrateful and exaggerative and whining automatically devalues your opinion and cements (in her mind) that you are, in fact, a child. Try a new strategy since this one is clearly not working.\n\nActually sit her down and start with a request that she just hears you out. Preface the conversation by explaining that you love her and you aren\u2019t attacking her but X, Y, Z are the reasons you no longer enjoy Thanksgiving. It doesn\u2019t sound like the majority of these issues are your mom\u2019s fault, so just tell her you are confiding in her because she\u2019s your mom and you know she\u2019ll understand. When you reframe the way you approach someone, it\u2019s *amazing* how much they are more likely to both listen and understand. Emphasize that your desire to boycott has nothing to do with not loving her but everything to do with not feeling respected as an independent adult. \n\nRemember: the biggest problem with communication is the assumption that it happened in the first place. \n\nChange your approach and you may be surprised how your mom\u2019s reaction might change.\n\nNTA.", "Age please.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But for different reasons than some other people here.  First off, it definitely sucks being stuck at the 'kids' table if you're having to be the babysitter, but frequently this is due to space, not actual age.  I was always in a bad spot because my mom had me at a young age, which made me 10 years older or younger than my cousins, so I didn't have anyone of my age to talk to no matter which table I sat at.\n\nThe other reason is eventually every young adult has to make the break for family events like this and spend the first one away from the family.  It marks an important change in the family dynamic, but your mother was (more than likely) being sincere about her (especially) and the family missing you.  Go to your boyfriends anyway.", "NTA, also hate that guilt trip shit. I hope you have a fantastic Thanksgiving with your bf! \u2665\ufe0f", "NTA.
