When your nephew picked the flower and gifted it to you, your brother literally said out loud, \"my son has never gifted me a flower\". And he channeled that hurt into this toxic masculinity thing, took you aside and berated you for being too soft. I honestly would take your brother out to dinner and address this with him. Point out it's ok to want a close relationship with his son and to be upset and disappointed that his relationship isn't that at the moment. But at the end of the day he's the parent. If wants that closeness he has to be open to changing his mindset on what boys are and aren't allowed to do. At 5 yrs old Max already knows \"if I hurt myself and go to my parents, they will tell me to \"man up\" and punish me for crying. If I go to Aunty OP she won't get angry if I'm hurting badly enough it makes me cry and will give me cuddles & love\". Max goes to you for cuddles, asks to hold your hand, and picks you flowers because you make him feel safe enough to express himself. \n\n\nIf your brother genuinely wants to change this dynamic, he needs to change his behaviour so Max feels safe enough to be a child around him.

You are being a great aunt and he\u2019s lucky to have you around.", "NTA and as a parent of a toddler it makes me feel so sad that he doesn't feel comfortable crying to his dad.  They say little kids are \"worse\" around their support system because they know they'll be loved and supported rather than rebuffed.  I can't imagine the rejection this kid lives with.", "NTA\nThis sounds a lot like me at that age. I had a mother and grandmother that showed me it was alright to have emotions and actually show them even though I was male. I am over 6\u2019, well over 200 lbs. played football and other sports in high school and college. I have worked in different aspects of the construction industry for 30 years. I do not think anyone who knows me would use the word \u201csoft\u201d to describe me.\n\nYou are teaching your nephew it is ok to be himself, emotions are normal, and he has a safe place to come for comfort and conversation. Your brother is teaching him to hide part of himself. He is teaching him to put on a facade around his dad to make dad happy, but he cannot be himself with his father. I would hate the thought of my son not being able to confide in me or be his true self around me, it would break my heart.\n\nYou are also teaching your nephew, at a young age, how to be a better partner. He will have a more open mindset and be a better communicator when allowed to process and show emotions rather than being taught to stifle his feelings and be \u201cmanly\u201d. I applaud you for being willing to fight for your nephew. I think your brother needs therapy. If this is a big difference in beliefs of how to raise their son there will be ongoing and growing issues in their marriage. I wish you and your family the best.", "WTH?! Seriously over a flower? Your brother sounds jealous, you're NTA and your nephew sounds like a respectful young man.", "NTA -if anything, your brother is the soft one. He obviously is upset that his son will choose to confide in you over him. But it also seems that he\u2019s emotionally stunted and is going to make his son the same. Your brother needs to learn to express himself better, and allow his son to express himself or they will have a very turbulent relationship for the rest of their lives. \n\nYou are a gem for being someone for your nephew to rely on. Children should be allowed to feel however they feel.", "NTA, tell him if he ever wants a deep and meaningful relationship with his son he should stop being a cringe as fuck macho man. Boys can cry, boys can be effectionate and they can have emotions. Thank god his mum has more sense because that child would definitely grow up emotionally stunted not knowing how to feel or process emotions.", "NTA Have your brother listen to this, especially the last verse. https://youtu.be/BE5YzRr9yPo", "NTA.\nPoor kiddo.\nDad is jealous af.", "He honestly sounds jealous of your relationship with your nephew", "NTA.  Your brother is jealous of the bond that you have with his kid. You\u2019re more in tune with his kid\u2019s emotions, so he\u2019s mocking you both.", "NTA and I literally imagined Uncle Buck chewing into the principal", "Tell him that teaching is son to have emotions and to understand and explore them will reduce the probability of him raising a psycho fucking gun man.", "I think he's jealous of your relationship with his son and doesn't know how to be a loving father without seeming \"SOFT\".", "Oh, I know how this plays out! Client I work with said she kept her son at a distance when he was growing up so he wouldn't become a \"coward\". Refused to hug him and would literally push him away among other things. Guess who no longer talks to his mother. All I could think was no, lady, you just gave him intense emotional trauma that will fuck him up for the rest of his life. NTA keep loving on that poor boy cause he's gonna need it.", "NTA", "Your brother needs therapy.", "INFO: is your brother homophobic?", "NTA, u sound like a fantastic aunt :)", "NTA.  This shit pisses me off, that young boys and grown men cannot express emotions in a healthy way because it makes them \"soft.\"\n\nDo you know what happens when these boys are forced to hold everything in for their entire lives?  They finally snap and kill their families. \n\nSorry, OP.. your brother sucks.", "NTA\n\nYour brother needs therapy to deal with his masculinity issues.", "I had a very special relationship with my nephew, he loved sleepovers and we would eat KFC, watch Bugs Bunny and Iron Chef all night. BIL couldn\u2019t figure out why his sport mined little boy wanted to just hang with his aunt and older cousin. I think it was because he could be in a place where sports didn\u2019t exist.", "The first thing my 14 year old son does when he gets home from his fathers house is give me and his stepdad hugs. He says that he gets no physical affection when he\u2019s at his dads.", "Oh look, another father who thinks that emotions are gendered. Too many sons grow up lacking any sort of emotional intelligence and without the ability to communicate their feelings because of shit like this. NTA", "NTA, children are vulnerable with those they feel safe with. Your nephew trusts that you won't dismiss his emotions the way his father will. Your brother does need therapy to figure his shit out because his toxic attitude is going to eventually destroy his relationship with his kid and do a lot of damage to his kid in the process. Please continue to be a safe space for your nephew in any way that you can. It sounds like he'll need it.", "NTA. Does your brother consider himself an Alpha or call other men Betas? That\u2019s the vibe I\u2019m getting from him", "This. I was thinking it sounds like there is a shred of jealousy in there mixed with his toxic masculinity and homophobia. It sounds like the nephew is going to need an emotionally strong adult by their side because he's not going to get it from his dad unless he learns to change his ways. NTA", "Ask the brother if he wipes his ass or if that is gay.", "The child is only 5, your brother can change if he wants to, otherwise he is going to have a very strained relationship with his son", "+1 on brother drinking the toxic masculinity koolaid.", ">\u201cthat\u2019s gay son, men don\u2019t give men flowers\n\nYep. The brother is saying \"softie\" but what he means is \"gay.\"  He's worried OP is turning his son gay. \n\nTell your brother that homophobia is not a good look, OP. NTA", "[removed]", "He won\u2019t need it hopefully if OP sticks around!\n\nNTA OP. You\u2019re being the best auntie. So sad your brother can\u2019t see that. What a loser.", "The brother is definitely jealous. Wtf. \n\nIt\u2019s guys like this that make their children into jerks. I\u2019m so glad the SIL is on her side, but wow.", "This is it. Your brother wants that bond with his son but doesn't know how to express it or even initiate it. Be patient with him. I'd suggest you invite him along for the swims as well. You both are close enough in age and also seem to have a close bond. Doing things together like that with Max, will definitely help and allow him to initiate daddy and son activities as well", "This is my take, too. I think dad thinks he himself is being a \"softie\" by having the envious feelings of OP regarding the son's affections, but instead of working through that, he is playing the \"Oh, my son is having sensitive feelings, and as a manly man's man, I can't have that!!\" card.", "If he wants to be his son's favorite then he needs to do the work of cultivating that environment for his son to see him that way. Your kid at the age of five only really knows what they're told and what they see. And if what they have seen is that you as a parent are going to tell them to just get over it, but their aunt or their uncle is going to give them comfort and reassurance, then it's a no-brainer where they're going to go in times of distress. And when someone points that out to you, your reaction helps to determine where the next steps are going to go. If you lash out, then you are effectively denying the very help that you are seeking out.", "Thanks for your input! \n\nTo answer your question - we lost our parents when I was 5 and he was 13. We were raised by our grandpa (who died when my bro turned 18). Our grandpa was a very gentle and sweet man. In fact he was a *softie* as my brother would put haha. He did what he could to make our lives easier and happier. \n\nI don\u2019t remember much from my earlier years and I haven\u2019t really spoken to my brother about what our parents were like. He did love our gramps as much as I did tho.", "Interestingly enough, between the two of us I\u2019m known as the \u201ccold\u201d one haha. I\u2019m typically reserved and not into big shows of emotion. But I love his kid a lot and don\u2019t have problems showing it. \n\nMy brother is the one who\u2019s normally sappy about little things lmao. But when it comes to his son he suppresses all of that.  It\u2019s weird because this post actually shows the opposite of our regular personalities.", " Not all. He's a toxic idiot.", " You both are close enough in age and also seem to have a close bond.", "He probably says no homo while doing it.", "I say this as a 23 year old guy who\u2019s kinda stereotypically masculine for what its worth.", "And I cringe thinking of what will happen as the kid grows up.  Around the age of 12, when men tell their sons to stop crying and grow up, suicide rates of boys increase dramatically.\n\nWe literally kill our sons by telling them emotions are not allowed.", "Which u/Veblen1 already said word for word, suspect bot.", "#10/10", "This made me lol too hard", "Thank you. :)"]}
