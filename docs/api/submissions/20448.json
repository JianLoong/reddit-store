Has your brother been raised knowing how to express emotions like hurt, disappointment, loneliness in emotionally mature ways? Has your brother been taught to take accountability for his actions? Was your brother shamed as a kid by your parents for wanting cuddles & kisses? \n\nReading your post it jumps out that your brother is jealous of the close relationship you and your nephew have. When your nephew picked the flower and gifted it to you, your brother literally said out loud, \"my son has never gifted me a flower\". And he channeled that hurt into this toxic masculinity thing, took you aside and berated you for being too soft. I honestly would take your brother out to dinner and address this with him. Point out it's ok to want a close relationship with his son and to be upset and disappointed that his relationship isn't that at the moment. But at the end of the day he's the parent. If wants that closeness he has to be open to changing his mindset on what boys are and aren't allowed to do. At 5 yrs old Max already knows \"if I hurt myself and go to my parents, they will tell me to \"man up\" and punish me for crying. If I go to Aunty OP she won't get angry if I'm hurting badly enough it makes me cry and will give me cuddles & love\". Max goes to you for cuddles, asks to hold your hand, and picks you flowers because you make him feel safe enough to express himself. \n\n\nIf your brother genuinely wants to change this dynamic, he needs to change his behaviour so Max feels safe enough to be a child around him. Otherwise in 20 years time he'll have an adult son who only calls him out of obligation. And he'll be furious wanting to know why his son only shares the details of his life with his Aunt OP.", "You're NTA.

Of course he wants hugs and kisses, and give flowers and say I love you. Of course he will cry when hurt. But his father seems to think he has to do this \"stoic, manly\" persona and for what? For him to be ignored later in life by his own son?\n\nJust because he is loving and caring it doesn't mean he will get walked over. You can build character.

He's learned through experience as all kids do. Dad probably has a lot to unpack from his own childhood. Guessing the men in his life as a boy taught him to \"be tough\", etc. I hope with support from his wife and his sister, he can break that cycle for his son."]}
