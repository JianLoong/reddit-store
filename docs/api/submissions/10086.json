My kiddo doesn\u2019t go to bed until 9:30 (believe me we tried to get him to sleep earlier; it does not work) so we are still able to go to dinners etc. and if friends want to stay out later then my husband and I trade off who is going to go home and put kiddo to bed.\n\nThe last couple Hannah and Mark puts their son to bed at 7pm. His bedtime routine starts at 6:30pm. Apparently they need both of them to put him to bed, which is fine I understand that sometimes it takes more than 1 person.\n\nBut whenever we arrange dinner or a get together as a group Hannah and Mark want to schedule everything at a time that works for them. For example husband and I hosted a bbq last weekend and we wanted everyone to come by 4 (because kiddo would be awake from his nap then) and this couple said that was too late, we should do it at 12/1pm instead.\n\nWe have even offered them our kiddo\u2019s cot or a spare room to put their son to sleep in (something we do when at one of the other friends\u2019 houses if it gets late and our son is tired) but they always refuse.\n\nBasically this means they haven\u2019t really been to a lot of get togethers in the last 2 years.\n\nYesterday the wife, Hannah, called me and said that the bbq was the last straw. That as a mother I should understand that everything revolves around the child\u2019s routine and that as a mother she expected that I would push the group to accommodate her family\u2019s needs.

No of course not!\n\nHannah and Mark never want to host at their home which is okay that\u2019s up to them\n\nHowever as I clearly stated earlier when someone arranged something that is out of my child\u2019s routine, I adjust the routine to make it work", "Not every event needs to include children. I can't imagine the tantrum she will throw the first time someone in your friends group decides to have a child free wedding \ud83e\udd23", "Info why can't she adjust his bedtime to be more in line with everyone else's kids?", "She doesn\u2019t want to. She read that it\u2019s better for kids to have an early bedtime and a very strict routine so that\u2019s what she sticks to for the past two years\n\nWhich is fine it\u2019s her prerogative but I don\u2019t see how being a bit more flexible makes me a bad parent", "So this is on her then. She could have gradually added 10-30 minute changes to this bedtime since the baby started sleeping through the night if friend group activities were important enough to her. 9 or 930 is not the middle of the night. That's pretty normal bedtimes for kids I've been around. She must get up at some god awful time in the morning if the kid goes to sleep that early.", "I really like the way you are managing your kid. You are including him and meeting his sleep needs in a way that works for everyone.  This leads to happiness for the whole family,  and a sociable,  resilient kid.", "NTA. I had a \"friend\" like this. We'd agree to meet up at a certain time to take the toddlers to a park, and she'd turn up almost 2 hours late without informing me, because I don't even know why, but that was my kids lunch then nap time so he was always cranky. Then she'd moan at me about him always being cranky. She didn't stay a friend for long.", "NTA \n\nI have 2 kids, with my first I became almost a hermit. Everything revolved around her routine and if plans didn\u2019t fit I didn\u2019t go which really sucked and was hard. With my second I was determined that I would still put her first but also try not to be so rigid and it made life easier. She would sleep anywhere, it didn\u2019t have to be quiet or specific sound machines or perfectly dark she just grabs her blanket and crashes out. Having a set routine is great for kids but having the flexibility to adapt routines to encompass the whole family is important too. \n\nThink I lost track of this comment a little, but your not the AH. You can schedule your events around your child\u2019s schedule and when they plan they can do the same. If they can\u2019t make it then that\u2019s something they have to deal with but having the whole world evolve around their child and their needs is completely unreasonable", ">Tell yourself what you need to to feel good about yourself.\n\nHow the frick is 4pm to early? How do you schedule around that? I'm not eating dinner at 3pm because of someone else's stupid strick bedtime routine. \n\nAnd I know you're going to say 'hey, do lunch!' Well then the couple with a strict routine can host or organize a lunch.", "Ya I totally agree. I have a group of friends who love to host dinner parties and game nights, but I work night shift. I dont understand why they can't host an event that starts at 8am so I can attend. They did dinner at 7pm last week but I was just waking up!\n\nAlso ridiculous that pubs and liquor stores aren't open at 7am...", "NTA. If they're not happy with the times things are scheduled then they should start hosting instead. 4pm is a completely reasonable time to host a get together.  As a parent with going children then you just work around the time that suits you. \n\nNap finishes at 4? No problems, we'll be there around 4:45 etc\n\nWe had 2 under 2 so for the first few years we missed out on so much trying to juggle naps, feeding, and bed times. It was no one fault and we adjusted whenever we could. If we missed out we missed out plain and simple.", "You know what, I was going to come into this thread saying you could vary start times from time to time for them etc and try to find a compromise. As someone with 3 kids, their sleep schedules are important to me. For us that is early bedtimes like your friend. But the. I got the bit about them being upset your bbq started at the late time of 4pm??! That\u2019s a perfect bbq time. How is is too late? Being a parent means sometimes compromising and getting upset about a 4pm activity is absurd. Also, one way they can control the schedule is to host something themselves.", "Honestly I'm reading your comments and....  \n\n\n...genuine question - is whiney ass Hannah worth all this drama ?   \n\n\nYou guys seem to bend over backwards to accomodate her frequently considering how disparate her scheduling requirements are to the rest of you and she just whines and whines and is ungrateful.  \n\n\nIs she fun to hang out with? Great convo? Or are you just maintaining the friendship for the sake of old memories of when she was enjoyable to be around?  \n\n\nI'm childfree with lots of friends with kids, I'd say about half who are super strict on the kid's routine and not one single one of those friendships was this draining and hard. Even the 2 friends who have partners I can't stand so try to avoid hahaha"]}
