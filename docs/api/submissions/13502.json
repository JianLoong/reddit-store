However, it\u2019s *not okay* for your son to say those things. He clearly needs help processing his emotions, try therapy or something. You absolutely need to put a stop to that- not just for her but for his own sake. This isn\u2019t healthy.", "YTA - yes, your wife had an affair that ruined the marriage.  However, your son is clearly getting his feelings from somewhere (you), and your not saying anything to correct his terrible behavior is reinforcing it.\n\nDoes it really take much to say \"look, what happened between me and your mom was between me and your mom, and you can't call people names.  I raised you to have manners.  Use them.  She's your mom and she loves you.\"\n\nEdit to add - every parent I know has had a conversation with their 2yo child about feelings.  You're allowed to be angry and have feelings, but it's not okay to act out or call people names or have temper tantrums.  Maybe you and your son both need to revisit that conversation.  Because parenting is not about validating feelings, it's about teaching your child to be a good person in spite of those feelings.", "YTA. I so get where your kid is coming from, and he\u2019s justified with his anger. But if you don\u2019t put a stop to this behavior, it 100% will leak into your son\u2019s other relationships. If your kiddo is straight, no woman is going to want to be with him. He might become a misogynist. Regardless, you should be stopping this behavior.\n\n\u201cWhat mommy did wasn\u2019t ok, but that doesn\u2019t make it ok for you to call her names.\u201d\n\nEdit: Missed the age of the son. Regardless, a 14 year old knows way better.", "YTA \n\nYou should never be alright with your son speaking about anyone in such a manner regardless of his reasons.", "Complicated one. I would say you technically haven\u2019t done anything wrong, but it really isn\u2019t acceptable for your kid to be talking that way to their mom especially if you are sharing custody. \n\nTo me, it seems like you are vicariously getting some sort of validation out of your son ripping on your ex.\n\nPeople make mistakes. It\u2019s alright if you won\u2019t forgive your ex for what she did, but your ex (imo) should have a fair shot at being the kid\u2019s mom and she won\u2019t get that if you aren\u2019t discouraging this kind of language out of your son.", "YTA. Not correcting the behaviour allows incels like Andrew Tate to take over and ruin your son forever.\n\nThe fact that your son is in therapy and you apparently don't mention your ex-wife in front of him means the Internet is responsible for this change in demeanour, not resentment. Start now before he refuses to listen.", "YTA. We\u2019re talking about something that occurred between adults 6 years ago and your son is now angry and venomous about it?  That was almost half his life ago. I don\u2019t buy that you aren\u2019t influencing that. And even if you really aren\u2019t, you definitely cannot raise your son to be a disrespectful little shit. That is still his mother. \n\nMy son is 17. Me and his dad divorced for the same reason: he cheated. My son and his dad have a good relationship. My son had never heard me disrespect his father, nor will he. My son has no idea that his dad cheated. I\u2019ve always just said that we decided we were better as friends than at being married. Why?  Because MY relationship with his dad is completely separate from HIS relationship with his dad. If my son ever started saying things like what your son is, I\u2019d most definitely shut that shit down immediately. Because I\u2019m not raising a disrespectful little shit.", "YTA - in several comments you\u2019ve replied that he only says those things around her. You absolutely have the responsibility to teach him that regardless of his feelings, he shouldn\u2019t be talking to women like that, and definitely not his mom. He doesn\u2019t need to like her, or respect her, but letting him think that he can speak to women like that is only going to teach him that it\u2019s acceptable to talk to *other* women like that.", "YTA. It's not invalidating his feelings to tell him he can't speak to her that way. He can feel however he wants, but the blatant disrespect needs to stop and it's your job as a parents to teach him that. I don't blame him for feeling the way he does but that doesn't justify his behavior, you certainly wouldn't let him speak that way to you.", "YTA. He\u2019s 14, and you accepting this treatment of his MOTHER at this age is giving him the green light to treat other women and girls like that. \n\nIf he talks like that to her face then he\u2019ll be saying worse behind her back. \n\nIf one of his mates has a gf who cheats, what do you think he\u2019ll say? \n\nYTA. You need to pull him into line and explain that you and his mother\u2019s issues are adult problems and he needs to find another way to process his pain and anger. He can spend less time with her, for example, or you can spend more time doing things with him. He needs your guidance to show him other ways.", "Yes, YTA.  You can correct his behavior without invalidating his feelings.  There is no way you should be passively encouraging comments like that and him expressing anger in that way will get him in a lot of trouble down the line.  As his dad, you need to step up here.", "YTA. Regardless of what happened when you two were together, that is still his mother and a human being at that. You should not be allowing him to call anyone those words because he is a 14 year old boy who you need to raise to be respectful and that includes not using vile language towards women, even if he does resent them. \n\nIf you truly want his feelings to be valid, set up some therapy sessions for him. Or buy him a journal where he can write these things down. Anything is better than you allowing him to continue to throw hurtful words around.", "YTA for not speaking to him about it. As a parent of a teenage girl, those are huge red flags I warn my kid about. I am honestly concerned about his future relationships with women.", "YTA. You need to teach him that letting his feelings/emotions control him like that are going to lead to ruin.", "ESH - I may get downvoted for this since reddit hates cheaters with a passion and loves to see them get roasted but your son doesn't need to resort to such vile comments to your ex.\n\nYour silence is validating his behavior.  You can help him process his feelings though better channels and since you are still his father you need help him instead of just shrugging your shoulders and say you ex deserves it.\n\nYour ex needs to get into some family therapy with you son to see how they can have a relationship and not blame you.", "YTA for not teaching him to express his feelings in ways that are not deliberately hurtful. It doesn't invalidate his feelings to teach him to say \"I'm hurt and angry that your actions broke up our family \". In fact, it validates his feelings and allows his mother to help him deal with it. Instead, you're teaching him that being deliberately hurtful is an OK way to express his feelings. Should he call you a stupid cuck instead of telling you he's upset that you want him to wash the dishes or whatever? \n\nIf you don't know how to express your feelings in a healthy manner then get you and your son into therapy so you can both learn how and also work through the emotions the family break up has caused.\n\nETA- The way to help him stop expressing himself in this manner is to set boundaries. \"We don't talk to people this way. It's not okay to hurt people's feelings this way. If you can't stop doing this we're going to have to figure out a way together to help you stop.\" And then do that, whether it's maybe not seeing mom for a set amount of time while he works through it, whether it's doing and extra chore every time he does it, something constructive to help him remember that it's not ok. I would recommend a journal where every time he wants to refer to her that way he goes to his room and uses the journal to write what's really going on. Ie, I wanted to call my mom a whore again because I'm angry she wanted me to rake the lawn and I felt she was disrespectful in the way she was demanding I do it now. And then have him share the journal with his therapist so they can discover patterns and discuss how he can cope at those times.", "INFO: Does he speak about her like this to or in front of you, and how do you respond?\n\nAnd how does he know why your marriage ended?", "Oh my God, YTA. Your son is going to lead a very lonely, incel-type life if you don't figure out a way to instill in him some respect for women.", "I'm honestly not sure how to rate this one, so I won't.\n\nHighly recommend that you sit your son down and talk with him, though. His resentment is justified but his actions are not and you should very well know that. How is his life when he's at his moms? Have incidents like this happened in the past? Did she recently remarry?\n\nFrankly I'd look into getting your son therapy. It's pretty clear the divorce hurt him deeply and it sounds like he never had a positive outlet for those emotions. He really sounds like he needs to talk to someone about his anger.", "ESH, you guys are going to raise an abusive AH if this continues. He will have major problems with women his whole life.", "YTA, if you know the words he uses to refer to his mother then you really should've corrected that long ago. No matter what kind of person she is, you're letting him know that it's okay to openly insult people he doesn't like", "YTA. Your son can have his feelings and you can support that. However, being disrespectful is never ok. Is she a good mother to him? Does she treat him like trash? You as his parent/rile model should ALWAYS encourage respectful communication when upset or frustrated especially toward his mother.", "YTA. You still need to teach him to be respectful of his parent. He\u2019s using her infidelity as an excuse to disrespect her parenting. He doesn\u2019t have to like her, but as long as she\u2019s not being abusive he needs to treat her with basic decency.", "YTA. The way you go after people in the comments who disagree with you definitely makes me think that your son got it from somewhere\u2026\n\nEDIT: I work in family law, so I deal with contentious divorces and custody battles daily. You need to nip your son's behavior in the bud ***now*** before it gets brought up in court. No judge is going to believe that your son isn't learning this from you or from the people in your immediate environment, and they're definitely going to question why you haven't stepped up to correct that behavior.", "YTA.", "YTA", "YTA and you're raising an incel. Nip this in the bud NOW.", "YTA-he has every right to be angry with his mother but the way he is expressing that anger is unacceptable. You do not want to raise a son who is speaking this way to anyone. \n\nAs a parent, you need to talk to him about how to express himself. And if he isn\u2019t learning this language from you, then you need to find out where he IS learning it from because lord knows what else they\u2019re teaching him.", "YTA, but that doesn't mean that your ex wasn't an A for cheating, but she's not TA in this scenario. Your son is learning how to process this information. He is young and while he can condemn her actions, she is still his mother, in his life, and deserves respect. He is looking to your for an example on how to treat people and calling anyone a \"whore\" or \"nasty hoe\" is not okay. You absolutely can say, \"hey son, I agree that your mom's actions weren't okay, but that doesn't give you license to degrade people.\"", "Remember this when his girlfriend/wife breaks up with him because he doesn't understand respect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA.", "Yeah YTA here. He's a kid. Teach him how to handle his emotions and feelings of disappointment and dislike towards others.", "YTA. I don\u2019t know why you asked. You\u2019re pleased that he\u2019s punishing his mother for what she did to you, and you don\u2019t actually want him to stop.", "YTA for letting your son become abusive and unhinged. If he's allowed to continue to be abusive, he will CONTINUE to be abusive", "YTA you are raising your kid to be a misogynist. If this behavior is coming out of nowhere and only started recently, chances are he\u2019s getting it from someone.", "YTA.  He is entitled to his feelings, but he is not entitled to verbally abuse his mother.  He needs to learn this is not acceptable behavior and he needs to learn how to communicate his feelings without crude name calling.", "So, if I\u2019m giving OP the benefit of the doubt and he\u2019s not responsible for his son\u2019s knowledge and use of the offensive terms, I would really, really, really want to look into your son\u2019s socials. 14 is absolutely the right age for kids to start to follow incel media like \nAndrew Tate and his ilk. And given how offensive the language that Tate uses seems on par with the language the son is using towards his own mother, it would not surprise me at all if the son has gotten involved in misogynistic, woman-hating sites. \n\nEven if this is the case, OP has a BIG responsibility to help his son understand that woman are people too and absolutely deserving of respect, something he is not giving his mother. So yes, OP, I still consider that YTA because you are not intervening when you son is clearly crossing lines.", "YTA\n\nAs a parent, you should be teaching your son to treat people, including mom, with basic respect and decency.\n\nHopefully your son can learn to forgive her for his own sake.", "Lots of comments saying he has no reason to know, etc, and they are hopelessly misguided. Too many families break apart where the victim of the infidelity chooses not to say anything to protect the cheater and the cheater uses that against them by turning the kids against them. If your family breaks apart due to a malicious act on one person's part you are absolutely justified, and dare I say advised, to tell the family one time why it's happened. Harping on it, constantly bringing it up? No. But a one time admittance of it is fine. How the rest of the family members choose to feel/act about it is entirely out of your hands.", "Crazy that your son is probably going to end up being a nasty little incel that verbally abuses a woman the moment she does something he doesn't like and you're here seeking misogynists' approval on reddit.", "Sorry, but YTA.  Regardless of your wife's infidelity, your 6 year old boy (now 14) certainly did not hear those terms from his mother, now did he?   OP is in fact raising his son to hate his mother, and by extension, other women.", "YTA.  The divorce is an issue between you and your ex wife.  You are letting your son take up your issues and using language that is not okay.\n\nHow does your son even know about it?", "YTA for sure.", "NTA, but you should be teaching your son not to use those words anyway.   \n\nHis feelings are his, but it is your responsibility to ensure he behaves appropriately.", "YTA, your son wouldn\u2019t say those things if you didn\u2019t encourage him or badmouth your wife around him. You guys divorced when he was 6. A 6 year old shouldn\u2019t be hearing about how his mom slept with another person.", "YTA. It might be satisfying for if he disrespects your ex, but this is how your son will treat the women in his life. You might want to correct this", "NTA \n\nAs you said, you\u2019re not talking bad about her, he\u2019s doing it on his own.

Act like a father, not a spurned husband.", "YTA", "YTA Big Time", "NTA, but I really think you need to sit down with your son, and maybe a licensed family counselor, and discuss better ways to deal with his anger towards her. She did something awful that tore apart his family, and it only makes sense that he would resent her for it a bit. However, it is not his place to say those things to her at all as your previous marriage isn't really his business at such a young age.", "Based on your comments and further information, NTA. There is not much you can do beyond therapy and talking it out with him. I firmly believe giving birth to a child does not entitle you to respect. She broke the family and chose soneone else over you both, he is old enough to know that and judge her how he pleases.\n\nIt seems to me though, that he is unhappy at her house. Please look into resolving this in court for full custody, he is old enough now that he can have a say in most jurisdictions. This way, he won't have to wait until he is 18 to cut her out his life if he chooses to do so, and it gives him time to heal in hopefully a better manner than lashing out.", "YTA. Your kid isn't picking up this behavior from absolutely no where. He's picking it up from you. Even if you aren't saying it exactly your attitude and resentment tworads your ex is obvious in your writing. Also, let's not pretend the marriage failed 100% because she cheated and not because some factors you were involved in. It might be 75% her 25% you but it's rarely 100% on person.", "NTA\n\nOn the foundation that you telling the truth and you don't talk negatively about his mother then NTA. How can you manage how he talks to her when your not there and she refuses to work as a co-parenting team to deal with the issue.\n\nShe can either complain about it or work towards a solution together. Whilst you should talk to him about his language and behaviour, you can't parent something when your not present and she won't help fix the problem.", "NTA.\n\nHere's some advice:\n\n* Do not invalidate his feelings. That is most important and good job for keeping that up. Of course, if he gets used to using this vocabulary, it might progress to using it loosely elsewhere, so step 2:\n* He will be needing therapy, he's in his adolescents stage and will have many emotional issues regarding relationships, identity, and overall mental wellbeing. Apart from personal conflicts he might come across elsewhere, his broken parents' relationship will only amplify each pain he'll experience with others, so to reduce that, make sure to get keep him busy with useful activities, spend a lot of time with him, and connect him with a therapist.\n* Communicate with mother and tell her she'll have to do some effort in toning down on the 'labelling'. Calling him a misogynist won't make it any better rather stand as an excuse behind her lack of resentment over he actions. She's not entitled to respect, it must be earned.\n* If you have any additional family, keep him in that circle. Most likely, he'll be locked within his own mind when the topic of 'family' gets brought up, it might bring up a complex over his family situation, so if he ever has cousins, aunts, uncles, etc.. keep him in that circle.\n\nGood luck to you and your son. These things take time so please don't rush through any of them. You're a team, always remember that :)", "NTA\n\nShe cheated, your son found out, and he's obviously angry.\n\nHe shouldn't talk to her like that, but I mean he's young and this is the typical response to a divorce for reasons like that. He probably could use some counseling.", "Well if it isnt the consequences of my own actions... NTA not your fault she cheated and your son hates her", "Nta\n\nHe knows what she did and he knows she broke up his family. Not sure how he found out, but he is entitled to his opinion and his feelings based on fact. \n\nMy stance is that neither parent should ever bad mouth the other in front of the child, you seem to make it a point to just say nothing, I'm guessing because of time old rule of \"if you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything, \" which is completely fair in your case.", "NTA\n\nWhen someone cheats, respect will be lost.
