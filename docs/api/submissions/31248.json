Your dad is the one engaging in this weird Saturday behavior. Let him. It\u2019s relatively harmless (perhaps unpleasant for the phone agents, but that\u2019s another debate).

Sucks for your mom, but it is on him. He doesn't have to do that.\n\nYou can give up if people refuse to change, so as to not waste your breath, but if everyone jumps straight to enabling the world becomes a shittier place.", "NTA, and if your father can not learn something new at his not too old age, he is likely beyond help. As someone else pointed out, your mother being more upset about how her Saturday was going to go rather than trying to help your father grow, just enables him.\n\nYou might have to choose whether to really limit the contact you have with your dad, stop trying to help him learn and grow, or enjoy antagonizing him for his needless behavior. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA as a one-off experiment. Don't do this again, now you know it just means your dad calls up innocent call center workers and screams at them some more. But I applaud the point you're making, and you would also not be TA if you repeated that point with a smug, smug smirk \"don't yell at call center workers, dad, you get better deals if you don't do that, REMEMBER?\" every time he claims yelling gets him better service.", "NTA and also this whole story is hilarious", "NTA. Just NTA", "NTA. Dad is on a power trip. He yells and escalates issues until customer service tosses him a bone to shut him up or make him go away. The bone is then viewed as a reward. The problem is that Dad gets positive reinforcement from his behavior since he got a \u201creward,\u201d instead of understanding that it wasn\u2019t so much a reward as a metaphorical middle finger. He\u2019s not going to change.", "Yup. As someone who spent years working in customer service it\u2019s true. The nicer you are the more willing we are to give you a better deal if we can. If you\u2019re rude and yelling, fuck it. We\u2019re happy to send you to management and you can bother them and get the bare minimum."]}
