I am taking all my family( me&wife, mom&dad, brother&sis in law, my younger sister) to Goa for a nice 10 days vacation where we will celebrate their anniversary. Everyone got really happy and started planning/shopping for the trip. \n\nYesterday my wife asked me if her family can come to the trip I said yes they can come but they will have to pay for their own expenses. She got upset that I am not onboard with this I told her I am not saying they are not allowed to come it's just if they come they have to pay for their own travel and I am not obligated to pay for her family.

It\u2019s not fair of your wife to hijack the trip and make it about her family.", "NTA!

If it's just her parents, the expectation in an Indian family is that OP will pay for them, will give her & her parents bragging rights that the daughter married such a good man who takes such good care of his wife's parents. If anybody else is joining, the rules differ. If it's a much younger sibling, who's still in university, OP & wife + wife's parents will have to manage their expenses together - eg: wife's parents pay for hotel room & transport, OP will have to include sibling in food expenses, can't exclude one person who makes no money, that looks bad. But if it's an older brother, then brother can mostly pay for themselves, & even a bit extra to show thanks to OP for including wife's family & paying for wife's parents. But if it's a sister, then OP will have to pick up costs for sister. However, if sister is coming with her family (husband & kids), then her husband can pick up for costs of his family plus a bit for his in-laws (same as OP's in-laws) & also a bit extra, like say if the kids have all done some activities together. This is just how it works in Indian families.

If it's an event that both families have equal claim to, sure. For example my brother and his wife treated both our families for their kid's birthday.

It's lonely to be with someone like that, because they're not really doing life with you.\n\nWhat happens when you grow old together and it's time for retirement and the lower earning partner is significantly disadvantaged because of that? Are you still going to say sucks to suck, I have enough. Obviously, people need to be smart and make smart financial choices together. You shouldn't spend just cause someone wants xyz.\n\nAnd I think the discussion all depends on their dynamics. Maybe they split the other trip with her family proportionate to their incomes.
