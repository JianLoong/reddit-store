Planning on doing it by a lake and I\u2019ve already talked to her family and they will be there, I\u2019ve talked to my friends and her friends. From my immediate family I decided to only invite my dad. He said this was an AH move because it would be tough to not bring his wife and it would create more of a rift. This will also be how the wedding will be (him getting a solo invite) so I told him if he doesn\u2019t wanna come I understand but he should know I\u2019ll save the postage if he doesn\u2019t wanna come to the engagement. Me and him went back and forth so I decided to post here for a judgement. \n\nThe situation with my sisters and mom stems back to my sisters wedding 2 years ago. My two sisters are Bella (29) and Sarah (25). Bella got married back in 2019. I liked the guy and we became decent friends when I was a groomsman. I live halfway across the country so traveling back is tough and I only do it for big events. I was heavily involved in my sisters first wedding. I went to the showers, bachelor party, wedding and it was a pretty expensive couple weeks but I was willing. \n \n2 years ago my sister cheats on her husband with her current husband. Gets a divorce and engaged within like 3 months. I was across the country and not tuned into the situation but my moms stance on it pissed me off. She was always the big \u201cdo the right thing\u201d type. Religious and judgmental of others. Whenever she told me about the second wedding happening I was like \u201cam I supposed to support this\u201d? She got livid and said I need to be there in support as a family. I said if she would pay my ticket, my hotel and all my other expenses to come home then I would. But I\u2019m not dropping a grand to come home for a cheaters second wedding within 3 years. Who didn\u2019t even respect her first marriage. My mom lost it on me and said she would not pay for me but I had to be there. I said \u201cI heard you\u2019re dropping 10K on this wedding. So you\u2019ll finance a second wedding but not your sons plane ticket home\u201d? She hung up and that\u2019s been pretty much the last conversation we\u2019ve had. \n\nI didn\u2019t go to the wedding. I also refused Bella\u2019s husbands offer to be a groomsman. Which pissed off my other sister. Because of all the drama I was told not to come home for the Hollidays. I was given the silent treatment by my mom and sisters. I started dating my GF around this time and we went a trip. I posted pics of us and my sisters commented under the photos rude things about me being too cheap to buy a plane ticket but will spend money on trips. So I blocked them both and haven\u2019t spoken to them since. My dad is the only one I keep in contact with so that\u2019s why he\u2019s getting a solo invite. He wants the drama to end and thinks me giving a solo invite puts him in a losing spot. I told him that it\u2019s his wife\u2019s fault the situation is where it is. So it\u2019s not really my fault.

She is your Mother and time is far too short for BS.", "You all sound exhausting to be honest.", "Why are you inviting people for an engagement? Invite people for a wedding, sure, but an engagement party is just being full of yourself.", "ESH.  Your main issue with your mom and your sisters was that they were disrespecting the institution of marriage by cheating and remarrying and expecting you to treat the new marriage like a real marriage, then you disrespect your father's marriage by excluding his wife from events where spouses are nearly always expected to attend together.  Also, your engagement and wedding shouldn't be seen as opportunities to get petty revenge on your mom.", "YTA for putting your father in that position \n\nThey may be dropping $10k on her wedding, it doesn\u2019t mean you can demand a ticket home to be paid for as a consolation prize in your mid 20s\n\nYou stood your ground and didn\u2019t attend the wedding, but don\u2019t sacrifice your father to make your point", "ESH - you\u2019re allowed to invite whomever you want to whatever you want; and you\u2019ve reasonably said you don\u2019t mind if your dad decides not to attend.

Except the dad, I feel sorry for him, surrounded by assholes like President Skroob. \n\nThe OP might be the worst, making judgments about things that are none of his business as an excuse to get out of buying a plane ticket \u2014 but his siblings and mother give him a run for his money.", "For the overall situation, NTA. It\u2019s really messed up that your sister was being trashy and put her infidelity out in the open and then everyone seemed to laud her for it. Maybe there\u2019s more to the story regarding the marriage that wasn\u2019t explained to you- her first husband could have cheated beforehand making her feel justified in moving on pre-divorce. Without more information, it\u2019s hard to say 100% if she was wrong. But from what you\u2019ve said it seems like you were justified in being skeptical about showing your support then.\n\nEven if your mom is always trying to represent the moral high ground, she is also the mother of your sisters. It\u2019s unsurprising to me that she is still supporting your sister through the situation despite the fact it\u2019s hypocritical for her to do so. She probably finds it more morally right to be a supportive mother than to criticize her daughter\u2019s behavior enough to break their connection. I\u2019m sure she is also thinking about possible grandchildren and maintaining the relationships close to her. If I were you, I would try to make up with your mom\u2026 she doesn\u2019t sound evil, but don\u2019t expect her to turn her back on your sisters, that\u2019s probably an impossibility for her.\n\nYour sisters sound unbearable commenting on your post and shaming you for being unsupportive of Bella. If I were you, I would have commented on their wedding posts too and aired their dirty laundry. Once again though, knowing more of the story/prior situation would be helpful. She sounds shameless and like she wants to stir the pot even more. Your other sister ganging up on you says a lot about where she stands. Does she have more information than you? Have they always been closer to each other than you have to them?\n\nMy advice is to reach out to your mom and bury the hatchet if you can. You should be understanding of her situation and support for your sister, and explain why you didn\u2019t feel it was morally right to show your support then even if you can understand how it was right for her. Like bro let\u2019s be real, if you had a child and 20 years later they ended up behaving as your sister has, I bet there\u2019s a 99% chance you\u2019d stick by their side, too. If she\u2019s not a hypocrite and is truly a morally upright and fair person, then she will support you in your engagement just as she supported your sister! If she fights you on it, well, at least you can say you tried. This way you can also please your father and make it less straining on your parents relationship. \n\nAs for your sisters, they sound dramatic and like they\u2019re on their high horses still, I wouldn\u2019t bother trying to make up to them. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA you are free to decide who you want to have on your engagement.\n\n\nBut sidenote, I hope you asked your girlfriend, if she is fine with the idea of a public engagement. Otherwise this could become really embarrassing.\n\nOh and edit: yta for how you treat your sister.", "ESH except dad. It sounds like you got close to Bella's ex and so you don't know what their marriage was like. Maybe you never asked, or maybe she didn't want to damage your friendship with the ex. She's an ass for cheating, full stop. But if it was a bad marriage, she's entitled to divorce and get married again. Even if you hate that she cheated, she's still your sister and she didn't do you wrong, so you should have supported her. The remark to mom about her paying because she's already paying loads is so childish and genuinely just makes you seem cheap. It really doesn't sound like you couldn't afford it, just you didn't want to go, because Bella's a cheater and mom is a hypocrite. I'd have a little more sympathy if this was wedding number 3 or 4. People make mistakes, but should learn from them.\n\nYour sisters are total assholes for bombarding your social media with hate completely unprovoked, even if you're all fighting, there's just no excuse for mudslinging your family in public. \n\nIt also sounds like you never gave Bella's new husband a chance, especially when he extended an olive branch by asking you to be groomsman. He could be a really great guy and you'd never give him a chance because your sister cheated (he didn't cheat btw, even if he knew she was married, she cheated, not him). \n\nFinally you put dad in a really shit situation. If you want him to come, you have to invite his wife, even if you hate your mum. He's literally in the shittest situation of all, and you seem to have no sympathy, and just tell him to blame mum. Invite mum or else explain to dad you'll completely understand if he can't come. The damage is done. \n\nSeriously, poor dad. Everyone else really sucks here.", "YTA.
