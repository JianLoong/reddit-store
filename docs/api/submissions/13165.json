Planning on doing it by a lake and I\u2019ve already talked to her family and they will be there, I\u2019ve talked to my friends and her friends. From my immediate family I decided to only invite my dad. He said this was an AH move because it would be tough to not bring his wife and it would create more of a rift. This will also be how the wedding will be (him getting a solo invite) so I told him if he doesn\u2019t wanna come I understand but he should know I\u2019ll save the postage if he doesn\u2019t wanna come to the engagement. Me and him went back and forth so I decided to post here for a judgement. \n\nThe situation with my sisters and mom stems back to my sisters wedding 2 years ago. My two sisters are Bella (29) and Sarah (25). Bella got married back in 2019. I liked the guy and we became decent friends when I was a groomsman. I live halfway across the country so traveling back is tough and I only do it for big events. I was heavily involved in my sisters first wedding. I went to the showers, bachelor party, wedding and it was a pretty expensive couple weeks but I was willing. \n \n2 years ago my sister cheats on her husband with her current husband. Gets a divorce and engaged within like 3 months. I was across the country and not tuned into the situation but my moms stance on it pissed me off. She was always the big \u201cdo the right thing\u201d type. Religious and judgmental of others. Whenever she told me about the second wedding happening I was like \u201cam I supposed to support this\u201d? She got livid and said I need to be there in support as a family. I said if she would pay my ticket, my hotel and all my other expenses to come home then I would. But I\u2019m not dropping a grand to come home for a cheaters second wedding within 3 years. Who didn\u2019t even respect her first marriage. My mom lost it on me and said she would not pay for me but I had to be there. I said \u201cI heard you\u2019re dropping 10K on this wedding. So you\u2019ll finance a second wedding but not your sons plane ticket home\u201d? She hung up and that\u2019s been pretty much the last conversation we\u2019ve had. \n\nI didn\u2019t go to the wedding. I also refused Bella\u2019s husbands offer to be a groomsman. Which pissed off my other sister. Because of all the drama I was told not to come home for the Hollidays. I was given the silent treatment by my mom and sisters. I started dating my GF around this time and we went a trip. I posted pics of us and my sisters commented under the photos rude things about me being too cheap to buy a plane ticket but will spend money on trips. So I blocked them both and haven\u2019t spoken to them since. My dad is the only one I keep in contact with so that\u2019s why he\u2019s getting a solo invite. He wants the drama to end and thinks me giving a solo invite puts him in a losing spot. I told him that it\u2019s his wife\u2019s fault the situation is where it is. So it\u2019s not really my fault.

Invite people for a wedding, sure, but an engagement party is just being full of yourself.", "ESH.  Your main issue with your mom and your sisters was that they were disrespecting the institution of marriage by cheating and remarrying and expecting you to treat the new marriage like a real marriage, then you disrespect your father's marriage by excluding his wife from events where spouses are nearly always expected to attend together.  Also, your engagement and wedding shouldn't be seen as opportunities to get petty revenge on your mom.", "YTA for putting your father in that position \n\nThey may be dropping $10k on her wedding, it doesn\u2019t mean you can demand a ticket home to be paid for as a consolation prize in your mid 20s\n\nYou stood your ground and didn\u2019t attend the wedding, but don\u2019t sacrifice your father to make your point", "ESH - you\u2019re allowed to invite whomever you want to whatever you want; and you\u2019ve reasonably said you don\u2019t mind if your dad decides not to attend.

Except the dad, I feel sorry for him, surrounded by assholes like President Skroob. \n\nThe OP might be the worst, making judgments about things that are none of his business as an excuse to get out of buying a plane ticket \u2014 but his siblings and mother give him a run for his money.", "For the overall situation, NTA. It\u2019s really messed up that your sister was being trashy and put her infidelity out in the open and then everyone seemed to laud her for it. Maybe there\u2019s more to the story regarding the marriage that wasn\u2019t explained to you- her first husband could have cheated beforehand making her feel justified in moving on pre-divorce. Without more information, it\u2019s hard to say 100% if she was wrong. But from what you\u2019ve said it seems like you were justified in being skeptical about showing your support then.\n\nEven if your mom is always trying to represent the moral high ground, she is also the mother of your sisters. It\u2019s unsurprising to me that she is still supporting your sister through the situation despite the fact it\u2019s hypocritical for her to do so. She probably finds it more morally right to be a supportive mother than to criticize her daughter\u2019s behavior enough to break their connection. I\u2019m sure she is also thinking about possible grandchildren and maintaining the relationships close to her. If I were you, I would try to make up with your mom\u2026 she doesn\u2019t sound evil, but don\u2019t expect her to turn her back on your sisters, that\u2019s probably an impossibility for her.\n\nYour sisters sound unbearable commenting on your post and shaming you for being unsupportive of Bella. If I were you, I would have commented on their wedding posts too and aired their dirty laundry. Once again though, knowing more of the story/prior situation would be helpful. She sounds shameless and like she wants to stir the pot even more. Your other sister ganging up on you says a lot about where she stands. Does she have more information than you? Have they always been closer to each other than you have to them?\n\nMy advice is to reach out to your mom and bury the hatchet if you can. You should be understanding of her situation and support for your sister, and explain why you didn\u2019t feel it was morally right to show your support then even if you can understand how it was right for her. Like bro let\u2019s be real, if you had a child and 20 years later they ended up behaving as your sister has, I bet there\u2019s a 99% chance you\u2019d stick by their side, too. If she\u2019s not a hypocrite and is truly a morally upright and fair person, then she will support you in your engagement just as she supported your sister! If she fights you on it, well, at least you can say you tried. This way you can also please your father and make it less straining on your parents relationship. \n\nAs for your sisters, they sound dramatic and like they\u2019re on their high horses still, I wouldn\u2019t bother trying to make up to them. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA you are free to decide who you want to have on your engagement.\n\n\nBut sidenote, I hope you asked your girlfriend, if she is fine with the idea of a public engagement. Otherwise this could become really embarrassing.\n\nOh and edit: yta for how you treat your sister.", "ESH except dad. It sounds like you got close to Bella's ex and so you don't know what their marriage was like. Maybe you never asked, or maybe she didn't want to damage your friendship with the ex. She's an ass for cheating, full stop. But if it was a bad marriage, she's entitled to divorce and get married again. Even if you hate that she cheated, she's still your sister and she didn't do you wrong, so you should have supported her. The remark to mom about her paying because she's already paying loads is so childish and genuinely just makes you seem cheap. It really doesn't sound like you couldn't afford it, just you didn't want to go, because Bella's a cheater and mom is a hypocrite. I'd have a little more sympathy if this was wedding number 3 or 4. People make mistakes, but should learn from them.\n\nYour sisters are total assholes for bombarding your social media with hate completely unprovoked, even if you're all fighting, there's just no excuse for mudslinging your family in public. \n\nIt also sounds like you never gave Bella's new husband a chance, especially when he extended an olive branch by asking you to be groomsman. He could be a really great guy and you'd never give him a chance because your sister cheated (he didn't cheat btw, even if he knew she was married, she cheated, not him). \n\nFinally you put dad in a really shit situation. If you want him to come, you have to invite his wife, even if you hate your mum. He's literally in the shittest situation of all, and you seem to have no sympathy, and just tell him to blame mum. Invite mum or else explain to dad you'll completely understand if he can't come. The damage is done. \n\nSeriously, poor dad. Everyone else really sucks here.", "YTA.

I think it would only be fair to everyone to know the entire story.\n\nI bring this up because you are young and life is too short to be estranged from your family. Their moral compass sounds like it needs some calibration but otherwise are they truly so toxic you must be NC with your mom and sisters forever? You are putting your dad in a lose lose situation. \n\nI would offer at least one last chance to settle things and clear the air, in light of your engagement.

NTA, but OP\u2019s poor Dad is being put in the middle of this.\n\nSo OP needs to be okay with his decision. \n\nIt\u2019s sad that the mother hasn\u2019t tried to reach out to OP in two years. I do think she was put in a hard spot too and chose to support her daughter over anything else, which is fine.

Everyone seems to be wrong except for the op. I was in a terribly abusive marriage with a dead bedroom and I didn\u2019t cheat but I wouldn\u2019t have blamed myself if I did. You have no idea from across the god damn country about the inner workings of your sisters marriage. So you\u2019re just out here judging people and cutting people off left and right. I used to do that with people I cared about to, just get mad and cut them off at the knees. I stopped doing that when my best friend did that to me. If I were your girlfriend I\u2019d be scared to get married to a guy who blocked 3/4 people in his immediate family. That\u2019s red flag central from one girl to another. This whole situation ends up terrible for you. Either you hate your mom for the rest of her life and that fucking sucks, or you forgive her in the future then feel like a Dick that she missed out on huge moments in your life. A couple of years ago I cut my dad off for a year. It was the same year my brother got married. I insisted I wanted nothing to do with him and I got what I wanted, my entire immediate family sat together all night and I was at a table with my random cousins all night. Now I\u2019m speaking with my dad and I feel like an asshole about all the pics I missed out on because I was up on my moral high horse. I heard one time that holding anger in your heart towards another person is like you drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. Forgiveness is so powerful and I think you should extend an olive branch and figure this out rather than cutting your entire family out. It sounds to me like you have a chip on your shoulder about the entire situation. You can cut every single family member out but don\u2019t be surprised when you find yourself alone and missing family at holidays. And please just dont invite your dad. Don\u2019t make him choose between you or his wife and daughters. Ps she\u2019s not just \u201chis wife\u201d she\u2019s your mother, and framing it like that just further proves that you have a chip on your shoulder.

Just don\u2019t invite anyone on his side.", "Going to the wedding in emotional support of your child vs paying $10,000 are two very different things.

He said he told dad he'll understand but if he doesn't want to come, he'll save the postage and not invite him to the wedding. \n\nRegarding the cheating, I'm with you completely that it's horrendous and I'd never forgive someone who cheated on me or a close friend or family member. But if my close friend or family member cheated, I'd certainly give them a piece of my mind, but it wouldn't be grounds for me to burn bridges with them. \n\nRegarding Bella's new husband, we absolutely don't know enough to say he's not a great guy and doesn't deserve a chance. Personally I'd say he does even if he knew about the cheating. Bella could have lied lots and said they were separated. Or Bella's ex could have been cheating too.

I'm just trying to highlight her frame of mind. She obviously has issues with the cheating, but there's 100s of possible reasons she could forgive the daughter, and OP openly admitted he was completely out of the loop and doesn't know much about the 1st marriage or the divorce. I don't think he should judge her so harshly when he admits he doesn't know the details. I just think he was really rude before mom's ultimatum, and someone's 2nd wedding is very different to their 3rd. 2nd means you married the wrong person, it's a mistake. 3rd means you probably don't really give a shit and just like having weddings \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "My take was more that was his mother insisting that he pay a lot of money to fly across the country to attend a wedding he doesn't believe it, for a sister he no longer respects.

Sounds reasonable to me.", "Op tried to extort mom to pay for everything when he had the money to pay himself.

I just think he should have gone himself, and it's really harsh to now ask dad to take sides too. A lot of people are saying it's really straight forward for dad, he should just come alone, but that will undoubtedly damage his relationship with his wife, and the daughters. Yeah OP is the nicer kid and nicer than the wife, but it's really shit to make him choose, and the passive aggressive statement of \"I'll understand if you say no but I'll not bother wasting money inviting you to the wedding\" is really harsh. It's an engagement party.", "Yep yep have agreed in several other replies here, mom should not have made the ultimatum. But the comment I was replying to was \"dad is either with you or against you\" and that is an ultimatum too, and sounded really similar to the tone of OP when he told dad he'd understand if he didn't come. Dad's desperately trying to hold the family together, while everyone else throws around ultimatums and mudslings. OP admitted he doesn't know the full story of the divorce, and chose not to find out before trying to extort money from mom. He's happy to go if she pays?
