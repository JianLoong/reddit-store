I politely said no, explaining that it was my birthday gift and I wanted to keep it.\n\nBut then the little girl started crying, and her mother came over and started berating me, saying that I was being selfish and that I should give the balloon to the little girl to make her happy. I tried to explain that it was special to me and I didn't want to give it up, but the mother wouldn't listen and got more and more angry.\n\nIn the end, I had to just walk away while the little girl was still crying and the mother was shouting insults at me.
