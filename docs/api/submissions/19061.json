You're 100% right. I'm not in the US. I'm in the UK but we have a relatively decent legal system, as for teachers, docs etc. I'm the one who gets up at 6am every morning to get the kids breakfast and dressed for school.

I just have these massive feelings of guilt whenever I think about leaving.

I still have memories BURNED into my head of the brutal end-of-marriage fights, like I still remember what my dad was wearing when they told me they were getting a divorce, and then later that day when they got in a big fight and he left the house. Shit rides with you a long time. Shield them from it as best you can until they're a little bit older, and even then you might have problems, they'll be angry for a bit. Shit I didn't come to terms with it until I was in my early 20's, and after a few good heart to hearts with my dad, I have a TON of respect for the way that man handled it. I wish I could've seen it from that side at 12, 15, 18, any earlier. \n\nIt would be worth seeing a lawyer about 50/50, and also \"How do I KEEP 50/50\". Because who knows he might have tips and tricks you never even knew of. Stuff like \"don't tell her that you had a beer before driving you and the kids home\" that kinda thing, innocuous stuff that vultures will use to try and screw you over basically. \n\nSo for my dad: Moms alcoholism was getting bad, lots of friends and her family started cutting her off, dad didn't want to push the court for a different custody arrangement. \"A kid should have their mom\" and my mom was a great woman. It was only when she drove HAMMERED to my cousins graduation party 45 minutes up the highway from my house that he pushed for full custody, and that was after her sisters and brothers all wrote her a letter saying \"Give Dad full custody or we're backing him in court\". \n\nYou've got options, and it will definitely suck, but as you get longer in years, it's important for your kids to see what two adults who love each other look like. And if you do the right thing for all parties involved, and don't stoop to some lower, petty, level, then your kids will appreciate that later on when they've grown up a bit.\n\nGood luck bud, I always hate when these kinds of posts turn up because it's one conflict but shows a bigger picture, and I've been there and it hurts.", "before you assume the absolute worst situation. don't take legal advice from your opponent and go speak to an attorney.\n\ndo some research. figure out who you need- presumably a serious custody bulldog attorney. but you need real legal advice.\n\nnot reddit advice. not google advice.\n\nyou need an attorney you knows your local custody laws, and the local judges, to actually tell you what is realistic.\n\ncuz yeah, maybe she'd end up with full custody or maybe not. and you're putting yourself and your kids thru h\\*ll because you're scared.\n\nquietly gather information.\n\nand if you opt to stay. \n\nwell, learn not to drag your kids into your fights.", "It is not a foregone conclusion that the person with the most expensive lawyer will win.

It's just an argument to really think about what would be best for all. OP should really just consult an attorney and talk out his options.

Note your actually parental duties that you do for your son and be honest and note hers.

What they need to see is that you are an active and reliable participant in parenting.  I would start now to 6 months and if there are no improvement, then I contact a divorce attorney.  You can also add any previous incidents if you think it may help but make sure you remember accurately the dates and times.\n\nAs you are keeping notes on yours and your wife's interaction, make sure that you are not keeping these notes where your wife can find them, destroy them or come up with her own versions to each incident.
