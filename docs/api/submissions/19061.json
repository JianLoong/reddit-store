You're 100% right. I'm not in the US. I'm in the UK but we have a relatively decent legal system, as for teachers, docs etc. I'm the one who gets up at 6am every morning to get the kids breakfast and dressed for school. While my wife stays in bed. I'll drop them off and pick them up and I run them to all their clubs. I'll cook dinner at least 50% of the time. And I'll do their homework with them. I'll take them swimming at the weekends and down to the park.\n\nSo what is really holding me back? I'm scared.. pure and simple. What if she just keeps taking me to court? I can probably afford one decent legal battle and then financially I'll be done. What if the times u don't have the kids she poisons them against me? I've seen it done to two of my friends and it has almost broken them. I never belittle my wife tonour kids. I never would but I truly believe she will try and do it to me.\n\nFor some reason I also have this unfathomable feeling of responsibility for my wife, she is not a happy woman, she has fallen out with all her old friends, the friends that she does have are quite superficial and they are not true friends and confidants. She has fallen out with pretty much all of her family. I just feel that if I left she wouldn't have anyone. That might come across as quite conceited , and perhaps it is.. I just have these massive feelings of guilt whenever I think about leaving. And I feel sorry for her.\n\nIf it was up to me I'd love to able to split and at the very least remain cordial and coparent together.. she just will not go fo that and will glady pursue things because she feel slighted.", "Yeah, if you can\u2019t get her to go to therapy, go for yourself to help you navigate this awful situation.", "I'm sorry you're in a rough spot here bud, as a child of divorced parents I feel for ya and your family. \n\nMy only advice is keep the fighting and stuff away from the kids. I still have memories BURNED into my head of the brutal end-of-marriage fights, like I still remember what my dad was wearing when they told me they were getting a divorce, and then later that day when they got in a big fight and he left the house. Shit rides with you a long time. Shield them from it as best you can until they're a little bit older, and even then you might have problems, they'll be angry for a bit. Shit I didn't come to terms with it until I was in my early 20's, and after a few good heart to hearts with my dad, I have a TON of respect for the way that man handled it. I wish I could've seen it from that side at 12, 15, 18, any earlier. \n\nIt would be worth seeing a lawyer about 50/50, and also \"How do I KEEP 50/50\". Because who knows he might have tips and tricks you never even knew of. Stuff like \"don't tell her that you had a beer before driving you and the kids home\" that kinda thing, innocuous stuff that vultures will use to try and screw you over basically. \n\nSo for my dad: Moms alcoholism was getting bad, lots of friends and her family started cutting her off, dad didn't want to push the court for a different custody arrangement. \"A kid should have their mom\" and my mom was a great woman. It was only when she drove HAMMERED to my cousins graduation party 45 minutes up the highway from my house that he pushed for full custody, and that was after her sisters and brothers all wrote her a letter saying \"Give Dad full custody or we're backing him in court\". \n\nYou've got options, and it will definitely suck, but as you get longer in years, it's important for your kids to see what two adults who love each other look like. And if you do the right thing for all parties involved, and don't stoop to some lower, petty, level, then your kids will appreciate that later on when they've grown up a bit.\n\nGood luck bud, I always hate when these kinds of posts turn up because it's one conflict but shows a bigger picture, and I've been there and it hurts.", "before you assume the absolute worst situation. don't take legal advice from your opponent and go speak to an attorney.\n\ndo some research. figure out who you need- presumably a serious custody bulldog attorney. but you need real legal advice.\n\nnot reddit advice. not google advice.\n\nyou need an attorney you knows your local custody laws, and the local judges, to actually tell you what is realistic.\n\ncuz yeah, maybe she'd end up with full custody or maybe not. and you're putting yourself and your kids thru h\\*ll because you're scared.\n\nquietly gather information.\n\nand if you opt to stay. \n\nwell, learn not to drag your kids into your fights.", "It is not a foregone conclusion that the person with the most expensive lawyer will win.

It means a lot.", "Also, I would slowly start getting consults from every great to excellent divorce attorney in a 50mi radius. If they consult with you, they cannot represent her. It's time consuming but worth it, if you can get it done.", "got any examples?", "I don't think anyone is blaming OP. But it is fair to point out how this could mess up the perception of a good relationship of his kids. It's the same for women in abusive relationships. It's just an argument to really think about what would be best for all. OP should really just consult an attorney and talk out his options. Maybe it's not as dire as he imagines it to be and then he can go from there. Women in abusive relationships are also encouraged to leave (for their own sake and their children's sake) even though it is always easier said than done. But unlike many women in abusive relationships OP seems to earn money to sustain himself and probably his kids too. It's just all in all a shitty situation.", "No? It's not an abused person's fault they're being abused. Doesn't change the fact that seeing abuse on the reg fucks kids up."]}
