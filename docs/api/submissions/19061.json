She dodged the offer but then went on to tell my son (10m) that when my wife and I first met she was earning double the amount of money that I was.\n\nI asked how she was making twice the amount that I was and she replied that she was renting 4  houses out to students. I then asked her how she managed to afford to buy those 4 houses? She told me that her mother gave her the money to buy them. I then pointed out that she had not actually made any money that wasn't based on a gift or had been given to her and that the only reason she could affrod the capital was because it was given to her and she had not had to work to build up some start up capital of her own at all.\n\nI've worked all my life and apart from a little help to buy my first car I've had no hand outs from parents or family.

My partner had two very unhappy parents and they divorced once he was an adult. He barely has a relationship with his father. \n\nGo to therapy yourself. Get your kids in therapy too-they don\u2019t deserve to have to deal with this once they are adults trying to figure out why they feel not good enough, or why their relationships never work out.

As for ending it. She's already said that she'd want to have full custody of the kids and would fight me in court. I'd be a dad, up against a mother in court who literally has millions to throw at lawyers if she wanted to...

She had the houses prior to me meeting her and in all honesty the gift money for the houses pales in comparison to the rest of her assets.. as soon as I was on the scene she pretty much gave up the houses and I ended up running them all for her, organising tenants, house checks, chasing rent, doing her accounts. I never got a penny out of it or asked for a penny, back then I was just happy to help her.", "Your post speaks of two people very unhappily living through a marriage.

It\u2019s a tough spot. For the sake of your mental health and decreasing the toxicity for your kids, I hope you can get therapy yourself or some form of support.

At least now you can prevent your kids from becoming like her.", "It doesn't really matter. Most states custody is 50-50. Full custody is when there's is something severely wrong with a parent.

How they allow people to treat them, their priorities, etc, are all things children absorb. So many women have daddy issues and are anxious attachment types and forget that they're setting their kids up to model that within their relationships as well. \n\nWhen you have kids, every choice you make can impact who they are and what treatment they allow within their relationships. Everybody, regardless of gender, needs to remember that.", "so you blame women who are stuck in toxic relationships too?", "Yes. They are usually blamed too here on Reddit.
