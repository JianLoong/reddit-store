{"id": 5969, "submission_id": "zymgnw", "title": "AITA for telling my bf his relationship with his SIL is too intimate and inappropriate?", "selftext": "I am a white American woman (23F) who has been dating an Iranian American man (24M) for 5 years. We met in high school and have known each other for almost 10 years. \n\nHe lives with his parents (60s) and his SIL (32F) who was married to his late brother. SIL has been in my bf's life since he was 3 or 4 since she met older bro in middle school or something. I thought it was weird that SIL still lives with them but after her marriage she chose to live with them because she loved her in-laws and my bf as her own family. A couple years after her wedding, she and older bro got into a car accident (she was heavily pregnant) and he died, she lost the baby, and had severe injuries that took a couple of years for her to fully recover from. \n\nMy in-laws are so dependent on her in every way. She and my bf financially provide and do all the housework since my in-laws are old, have health issues, and are retired. Nothing happens in their house without SIL being asked. My bf even consults with her before taking some time off work since they need to coordinate taking care of in-laws. \n\nSIL always makes me uncomfortable and feel inadequate. I feel like I will never belong in the family as a daughter-in-law while she is around. It is frustrating that her husband has been long dead for over a decade and she is still keeping his family tied. I assumed she would eventually move out and get over this by getting married and getting her own life but the chances seem slim.\n\nSIL is also Iranian and while they all speak in English around me, sometimes my bf and SIL will break into Farsi while telling jokes or being overly friendly, and he looks at her with such admiration and fondness. I don't think he's ever looked at me that way. He also fondly calls her maman sometimes which means mom is Farsi. \n\nI also found out that SIL sometimes gets dizzy since her accident and once she fell down the stairs and broke her foot and had a concussion. I went to visit and she looked miserable. Apparently she had complex PTSD from the accident and getting injured really \"triggers\" her. During this time my bf carried her up and down the stairs and I saw him holding her hair and caressing it while she threw up once.\n\nThis was the final straw and I blew up at him later. I told him to stop calling her maman and being so overly intimate with her. He seemed annoyed and said this is normal in their family and I should stop telling him how to behave in his relationships since his relationship with SIL is purely platonic. He also called me jealous which made me angrier. \n\nI told him that the two of them seem more like a couple than me and him. I called him incestuous and said his culture is disgusting if this is considered normal, I know it was messed up but I was just so upset and tired of my concerns being dismissed. That really upset him and he has not replied to my texts since. \n\nMy friends think I was in the right and some said this is what happens when you date a mommy's boy from another culture. But I want an unbiased opinion so AITA?\n\nEDIT: clarifying ages since some commenters are confused. Bf and his brother were 10 years apart. When older bro met SIL, they both were 13 and my bf was 3. They got married as soon as they both turned 18 since SIL lived with an aunt and wanted to move in with in-laws and her husband asap. Older bro died the next year when they were 19 and my bf was 9. Now my bf is 24, and SIL is 34. It's been 15 years since older bro and their baby died. Also I called my in-laws \"old\" because I meant they are older or elderly and in their 60s. They had my bf pretty late.", "created_utc": 1672362311, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zymgnw/aita_for_telling_my_bf_his_relationship_with_his/", "score": 2231, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She isn\u2019t \u201clike family.\u201d She is family. It sounds like you are jealous. If she left, would you take over all her duties in caring for your bf\u2019s parents? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he breaks up with you for how you are acting. He\u2019s not going to choose you over his family. So either respect his family, or move on.", "YTA \n\nWow. Just wow. I don't have the energy to unpack all the insecurities and weird attitudes you have here, but it's like, all of it. Every line of your post. \n\nHe calls her 'maman' for goodness sake. She's a *mother figure* to him, not a romantic one. \n\nI'll repeat, he is affectionate and caring with her because she is like a mother to him. Helping someone with an injury or who is ill is not incestuous.\n\nIf he doesn't look at you with fondness and admiration, then maybe you two should reconsider your relationship. Given your anger and jealousy, it seems like a good idea from his side to do that. \n\nBut it's really got nothing at all to do with your SIL.", "YTA. \n\n>> He also called me jealous\n\nWell, I mean if the green-eyed shoe fits. \n\nYou should probably start calling him your *ex*-boyfriend since you insulted him, his family, and his culture. Not to mention the fact that you accused him of incest with someone he *isn\u2019t biologically related to* because you\u2019re too insecure to accept that his SIL, who has been in his life since he was a *toddler*, isn\u2019t going anywhere.", "You\u2019re going to be the reason he goes back to dating Iranian women. You\u2019re living up to some embarrassing American stereotypes. Stepping into another culture and immediately judging anything you don\u2019t like, viewing everything from that American lens", "Your BF has known this woman for most of his life and obviously views her as family, and nothing you describe is inappropriate behaviour in that regard. You sound overly jealous of her for no real reason, and you most definitely do not get to dictate her position in the family - in fact, she has already and likely will stay much, much longer than you ever will, especially if you continue like this. You also sound not-so-subtly racist. Get over yourself and do better, or walk away. **YTA**", "YTA. \nYou went too far by insulting his family and culture. \nAnd his SIL is his family. You said it yourself: she\u2019s been in his life since he was little, and still stayed even after brother passed away. \nThere isn\u2019t anything sexual about caring for another person\u2026 you have to get over your insecurity. Perhaps actually talk to your bf and try to get to know SIL. \nUnless that\u2019s in the past now!", "Wow. YTA and apparently a sentient pile of red flags.\n\nYour boyfriend clearly views SIL as another mother figure, and you described nothing that goes outside of a close, loving, parent-child type relationship. Like, you said he literally nicknames her \"mom.\"\n\nAlso, sounds like SIL kept it together and continued her husband's role in the family after the horrific trauma and loss of the accident. An oldest brother taking over care of family affairs when the parents no longer can handle it is normal in many traditional cultures, and sounds like it's normal to your boyfriend's culture. SIL choosing to honor her dead husband and child by keeping the close connection and fulfilling some of her husband's roles in his tragic absence is a beautiful act of love.\n\nIf you actually want to keep this relationship, take some time to educate yourself on your boyfriend's culture and learn some basic farsi.", "Yeah, sorry, but YTA,\nThe way you talk about your boyfriend and his family is absolutely rude and unnecessary. If you think he relied on her too much, then that should have been something to address in private without calling his culture and their relationship disgusting and incestuous. Not to mention that if you already had these thoughts about the family and their culture, there is no way your action and demeanor did not show that to the parent. I am going to try to put into perspective for you and hope it helps:\n\nWhen his brother died and SIL lost both her husband and her child, their whole family was mourning together. Your boyfriend's family was mourning a son and a grandchild with your SIL while she was mourning her husband and her child passing away at once. If her family is not in the picture and the event caused her PTSD, then it would make sense she would rely on them for emotional support, and their bond became stronger. \n\nWhat you are calling a disgusting culture and an incestuous relationship could literally be the result of a 2 decade-long bond throughout and after the marriage. It also does not help that you never listed what the parents' medical condition was or how severe it is for them because she may be their full time caretaker to repay their kindness to her for the last 2 decades. Meaning it would make sense to be overly reliant on her, but based on your post and your comments it a lot of speculation without a lot of explanation from the family themselves. \n\nI understand that you have concerns about your relationship, but YTA.\nEdit: took out the word year in one part", "YTA if something happened to my husband there is not a soul alive that would keep me away from my MIL and FIL. \nShe has been in his life since he was tiny, it is completely unreasonable to expect them to kick her out of their lives so there is room for you. They are holding on to her for their son just as she is holding on to them for her husband.", "YTA-This is not incestuous and his culture is not disgusting. You acted in an inappropriate, immature, insecure, insensitive and petty manner.", "YTA. She *is* his family. He\u2019s known her since he was a small child. And you\u2019re right, you were wrong to slag off his culture just because *you* don\u2019t understand it. At any rate, I guess at least you showed your colours *before* he made the mistake of marrying you.", "YTA, you\u2019ve described as unsettling him holding her while she threw up?  He\u2019s from a culture where family means everything, he will of course always look out for his brothers wife.  Nothing sexual or anything. I suggest you walk away as you seem too jealous of him having respect for a lost loved ones wife", "YTA. There is so much to unwrap. Holy cow. Get your remaining shit together and stop sexualizing their (pretty normal, judging from your description) relationship.\n\n He held her hair when she vomited? He carried her up the stairs when she was injured? He would be an AH had he NOT done that. Those are normal things family members do for each other. \n\nAnd what's up with you trying to kick her out of HER family? You are so insecure, you should seek help.", "I\u2019m from India and in families where elder brother\u2019s wife is a lot elder than you, people do tend to equate / respect them as their mom. It\u2019s actually an honor to be revered like that by the husband\u2019s siblings and the younger siblings\u2019 spouses are used to that equation.\n\nYour BF\u2019s SIL being from their country obviously creates a comfort level and that\u2019s common to people from any country.\n\nYTA for making a mountain out of a molehill", "YTA\n\nShe\u2019s been in his life since he was a child. She was in a horrible accident, one that killed her husband and unborn child, and has found solace in family. They support each other.\n\n\u201cIt is frustrating that her husband has been long dead for over a decade and she is still keeping his family tied.\u201d I saw red over this and the sentence that followed.\n\nIf this is threatening to you instead of beautiful, do your boyfriend a favour and end things now. That\u2019s if he ever deigns to speak to you again after the unforgivable things you said.\n\n(Edited to add: get some non-racist friends, too.)", "Wow, yes you're absolutely the AH.", "YTA\n\nHe calls her Mom for goodness sake. What exactly do you think they're doing that has you so upset? It's not like she's new in his life.\n\nYou ARE jealous, and while the emotion of jealousy isn't the issue how you're handling it is", "YTA and I'm shocked you wrote this whole post out and still don't see it.", "YTA. And I'm low-key getting some racist vibes from your post. \n\n>his culture is disgusting if this is considered normal\n\nEspecially this comment. It's disgusting to you to support family?", "YTA \nWhere do I even begin?\n\n\n>It is frustrating that her husband has been long dead for over a decade and she is still keeping his family tied.\n\nI'm so sorry her husband's death, your boyfriend's BROTHER, didn't stop them being family. \n\n\n>He also fondly calls her maman sometimes which means mom is Farsi. \n>I told him to stop calling her maman \n\nYou said yourself it pretty much means mom. I highly doubt he is using it like \"daddy\". He is close to his SIL, someone who helps him care for his elderly parents. There is nothing wrong with it.\n\n>I also found out that SIL sometimes gets dizzy since her accident and once she fell down the stairs and broke her foot and had a concussion. I went to visit and she looked miserable. Apparently she had complex PTSD from the accident and getting injured really \"triggers\" her. \n\n\nReally quotes? I'm sure it does fucking trigger her. She lost her husband and her child and what sounds like some of her health in that wreck. So yeah I'm sure being injured probably brings back pretty bad memories. \n\n>During this time my bf carried her up and down the stairs and I saw him holding her hair and caressing it while she threw up once.\n\nThat's really sweet. He helped her get up and down stairs and have you never held the hair if a friend who got sick? When you hold someone's hair back while they vomit it is kinda of just second natures to try and sooth them by rubbing their back or hair. \n\n\n\n>. I called him incestuous and said his culture is disgusting if this is considered normal, I know it was messed up but I was just so upset and tired of my concerns being dismissed.\n\nWow racist much? Like damn.\n\n\n\n>That really upset him and he has not replied to my texts since. \n\nGood. I hope he never does \n\n>My friends think I was in the right and some said this is what happens when you date a mommy's boy from another culture\n\nYour friend is either just trying to be an echo chamber because \"girls stand up for their friends\" or she is racist too. \n\n\nUltimately it sounds like you lost a great guy.", "YTA, completely. Nowhere in this post is there an example of her coming between you and him. Of them being overtly romantic. She's behaving exactly like an older sister would, and he a younger brother. You're clearly just jealous, and feel like you can't live up to their relationship.", "YTA and obvi jealous of her", "YTA. I do think the cultural background is actually relevant here, contrary to many other people. Particularly, because I think SIL still living with his parents has a lot to do with the culture.  But regardless, he calls her mom. Nothing about their relationship seems inappropriate.", "YTA for saying his culture is disgusting and having no respect for what seems to be a family who has been through a lot. I can understand where your feelings come from, but if you want to be accepted in their family you should work for it. You can't claim someone and expect them to give up their family for you. If it's too much work for you, go find a man with less family duties.", "YTA\n\nFirst of all, you should be grateful that he doesn't look at you the way he does her because he's looking at her as a sister and you as a lover. The fact that you called him incestuous in all honesty would be a deal-breaker for me. I 100% understand why he's not contacting you  \n\nI can honestly tell you that I am wholeheartedly against Mama boys relationships. It's such a toxic Dynamic and it literally stunts a man from being in a healthy relationship with a partner. What you are describing sounds like familial relationships and not some gross inappropriate sexualized crap. I am sorry but you really kind of suck.", " *It is frustrating that her husband has been long dead for over a decade and she is still keeping his family tied. I assumed she would eventually move out and get over this by getting married and getting her own life but the chances seem slim.*\n\nThis part is just nonsense. You know nothing about loss of a loved partner. You may think you know what you would do, when in fact you don't know how you would do things until it happens.", "YTA. Nothing in this story seems overly intimate. If it was his actual sister would you think any of these things were strange? You say she has been in his life since he was very young, so to him she probably is just an older sister figure, who is taking care of the household.", "YTA. You've made some incredible accusations at him and have insulted his culture, hope the outburst was worth it because you just killed your chances of mending this relationship. You sound jealous and petty and lack empathy. Nothing you've described here sounded inappropriate, or \"incetuous\" (get a grip, jeez). It sounds like he's caring for a family member and you're too stuck in your own jealousy to see it.", "YTA. You are jealous. I would hope if you were sick and a guy you knew was around, he would hold your hair back as well.", "YTA. From what you've described, their relationship sounds like siblings. Which makes sense considering they are both each other's connection to the lost brother/husband. It's admirable that your SIL takes care of her elderly in-laws. Calling their culture disgusting just made you even more of an AH. Caring for someone isn't incestuous, but this statement does show that you have an incredibly messed up view of healthy platonic relationships.", "YTA -  your jealousy is entirely your problem.", "YTA and I honestly think you should reconsider your relationship with your boyfriend. It seems clear to me that you don\u2019t really understand him, his family, or his values. You are not seeing your SIL and her role in the family objectively and you might not be able to if this is something you\u2019ve been struggling with for a while. He deserves to feel comfortable with her and not like he has to reign himself in for the sake of your distorted perception. I\u2019m sorry!", "YTA.\n\nShe's his family and they're clearly very close.  You are clearly jealous and incredibly insecure.  You've got no business whatsoever telling him how he should be treating her.\n\nDouble YTA for calling them incestuous since they're not blood related so it isn't incest.\n\nI wouldn't expect him to reply to you, best to consider the relationship over and get yourself into therapy to try to get over your insecurity issues.", "YTA She is basically his sister, you blew up at him for holding her hair back when she was being sick? Please apologise for overeacting.\n\nSeems like you may be jealous of her. She is a bigger part of this family than you are right now. \n\nIf its not too late to repair this with an apology to your BF, you also need to get to know the SIL better. Be her friend - you'll learn she is no threat. \n\nShe does so much work for the family? Can you help out? I'm sure the whole family will appreciate it.\n\nEDIT: spelling", "YTA. You haven't listed anything that implies the relationship is anything more than platonic / familial, yet you called it incestuous.\n\nIf anyone in my own family was sick to the point of vomiting and I was in a position to care for them, yes, I would hold hair back or caress their head to try and make them feel better. It doesn't have to be anything more than simple human caring.", "He calls her maman. That means mom. Not darling baby girlfriend woman. For her, culturally, it's unlikely that she will ever remarry. She IS like his big sister. This is what it's like in his family and his culture and if you can't handle it you need to step away and find someone else.   \n\n\nYTA.", "YTA, you are a major AH and your friends are completely in the wrong for agreeing with you. Nothing you wrote suggests a \u201cmommy\u2019s boy\u201d at all. It sounds like your bf relates to his SIL like he would a blood related sibling due to how long he\u2019s known her. There are deep emotional ties with your SIL and your bf\u2019s family and no she doesn\u2019t have to just marry someone else and get over it to make you feel better.\n\nYour insecurities in the relationship are your own. This relationship is probably over, but if he gives you another chance you need to apologize. Your SIL being there isn\u2019t stopping you from belonging as a DIL. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019ve tried to learn his language or culture and that\u2019s the issue.", "YTA. \n\nThis is honestly why people should sit their partner down and talk about their cultural differences. I\u2019m Latina, my partner is Malaysian, we\u2019ve had roadblocks but with good communication it can be fixed. \n\nYou insulted this man\u2019s culture\u2014 you went after the woman who was married to his dead brother, whose practically his sister. \n\nIt\u2019s obvious you don\u2019t understand cultural differences. What did you expect the family to do? Boot her out the moment the brother died? She\u2019s family. She will always be family.

They care for each other and you barge in and demand he should cut all ties with her and assume it is inappropriate. That is disguising in my eyes.", "YTA and an insecure one at that.\n\nI don\u2019t know if this is a cultural issue as you seem to cast it. I am American but not the same ethnic culture as either you or your BF. But from what you\u2019ve shared, if this is cultural, my culture and sense of decency aligns with your BF and his family.\n\nYour concerns aren\u2019t being dismissed. However, your insecurity and jealousy were not being entertained. That\u2019s a good thing. But you leveled up nonetheless.\n\nYou seem not to understand that your BF\u2019s SIL is a member of his family forever. Her membership didn\u2019t expire because her husband died\u2014and that speaks volumes about the connection and resilience in this family. She earned her place as a beloved family member by being a good DIL, SIL (and second mom to your BF), and mom to her kids. She continues to support them and nurture a relationship with them, which is great for her kids and the family as a whole. Your BF calls her \u201cmaman,\u201d ffs. Not baby, honey, darling, sweetheart.\n\nShe has lasting physical and emotional effects from that horrifying accident that cost her husband\u2019s life and you begrudge the help your BF offers as well as all she does when she is able to help her in laws?

I shudder to think what you\u2019d call my father who has held and reassuringly stroked my hair and my back as I\u2019ve vomited when ill as an adult woman.

(Neither of our spouses gets upset by our closeness to in laws or to family friends, either.)\n\nYour BF\u2019s SIL is not \u201ctying\u201d his family or preventing you from being a part of the family.

Grow up and consider yourself the AH for being petty with your remarks about a woman that has stepped up to hold a family together when she COULD have absolutely left them behind. Your (ex hopefully)  boyfriend would've been the one to have to devote his efforts to take care of his aging parents, and if you had managed to get together I would assume he'd still be a mama's boy in your eyes for caring for his family. I'm glad you're not representative of how all families in the U.S. operate.", "YTA for what you said. What you described to me sounds normal for Iranian culture in terms of a platonic brother and sister relationship. Also, if he wanted to be with her, he wouldn\u2019t be stopped by his parents, but he\u2019s not, he\u2019s with you. \n\nNew edit: Your feeling of inadequacy are cultural and don\u2019t have anything to do with SIL unless she is actually berating you.\n\nSo that is what you need to address with your bf, not his relationship with her.

You shouldn\u2019t give him that ultimatum because that\u2019s selfish and controlling.", "YTA\n\nDoes she have any family other than your bf's? It sounds like they are the only family she has, especially during this hard time. Everyone takes their own time with grief. Her whole world was turned upside down. Just because her husband died doesn't mean they are no longer her family.\n\nHow does she make you feel uncomfortable and inadequate? I will admit, it sounds like they may naturally favor her since they have known her for a longer time and she does EVERYTHING for them. They may look to you to take up the same responsibilities since that is what they believe family will do for each other. If you are not ok with that, then yes, maybe marrying or dating someone in a culture like that is not right for you. I don't think that makes his culture disgusting though, just different from your own personal view of familial duties.\n\nHe probably looks at her with fondness and admiration because he sees how much she does for his parents when she technically doesn't have to. Also, he has known her for a long time and grew up with her in his life. He probably does see her as an older sister/mother figure: nurturing and caring for him and his parents. Holding back someone's hair when they are throwing up sounds like a nice and right thing to do, I don't see that as him making a move. \n\nIt does sound like you are jealous, but I don't think that's a bad thing. It is hard to date someone of a different culture. It is hard when you already see someone fulfilling the role you want to complete. I would suggest resolving this jealousy by getting to know her and create a friendship. Be open to his culture, but if you can't get past it, then it might be time to move on.", "YTA. You're feeling jealous and inadequate. That's on you.", "YTA Not sure there is enough time or words to unpack everything going on here but at the end of the day your jealous of the relationship and your projecting the inadequacies in your and your BFs relationship here. Also your friends seem a touch on the mean side.", "YTA. She is family and clearly he admires her for all she has done for his family. The bond that loss creates is so strong and truly I hope you don\u2019t ever experience that. Clearly you are jealous and have feelings of inadequacies that need to be addressed.

Hopefully he dumps your ass.", "> him incestuous and said his culture is disgusting\n\n**inhales** bruh..... \n\nYTA. Maybe if you took half the time researching the cultural differences as you did being offended by your SIL still staying with and taking care of her husband's parents then you would have been able to bring up your concerns respectfully and without making white people look worse.

If you married into this family and followed their cultural beliefs and practices you would probably feel differently about how they treat her because it would be the same way they treat you. Instead you proved that not only do you not intend to practice their beliefs and accept their culture but you crapped all over it all.

Kids do not move out at 16, they're not considered awkward or social misfits for not leaving the family home. \n\nOnce you marry into the family, you're family. You're treated like one and expected to act as one. It's not your place to try and impose your American values on centuries old traditions because you refuse to adapt. \n\nNo one is forcing you to be with your bf, he has not lied to you or hid his relationship with his family. \n\nYour SIL's parents died and were not the best of people according to your bf (whom you're calling a liar when you say \"I don't know how much of this I believe\"). \n\nHis parents were nice to her, loved her and appreciated her not leaving to get remarried after their son/her husband had died. \n\nShe's been living with them for over 20 years, taking care of them as the parents she never had and instead of trying to blend in, your first thought is \"I need to break this family unit up\" because you don't want to put in the effort, you don't want to live with them, take care of them or have them be part of your life in their traditional cultural way.\n\nYou want the American family model, visit on weekends, holidays, special occasions and return to your own home after. Sorry, the world doesn't revolve around you, you don't get to make your PIL's life difficult to appease your ego.\n\nYou don't get to insult their culture because you're jealous. You don't get to dictate what language they use with one another, sometimes certain jokes can't be translated, not everything is about you and your feelings. \n\nYou're walking into an established, close, tight-knit family. Your options are either accept it or walk away. There's no third option. \n\nYou do not get to impose your culture, your values, break up a family, alienate a widow that devoted 20+ years of her life to her PIL, you do not get to tell your bf what his relationship with her or his parents should be. You accept it, ALL of it, or walk away.\n\nDrop your entitled, close minded attitude. Try to learn from a different culture, maybe you'll find out it's not as weird as you think. If you put in the SLIGHTEST effort, they'll adore you for it. Don't self sabotage, you have a chance to be part of a very loving family. \n\nUntil then, YTA.", "YTA", "YTA for being a racist fuck.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We met in high school and have known each other for almost 10 years. \n\nHe lives with his parents (60s) and his SIL (32F) who was married to his late brother. SIL has been in my bf's life since he was 3 or 4 since she met older bro in middle school or something. I thought it was weird that SIL still lives with them but after her marriage she chose to live with them because she loved her in-laws and my bf as her own family. A couple years after her wedding, she and older bro got into a car accident (she was heavily pregnant) and he died, she lost the baby, and had severe injuries that took a couple of years for her to fully recover from. \n\nMy in-laws are so dependent on her in every way. She and my bf financially provide and do all the housework since my in-laws are old, have health issues, and are retired. Nothing happens in their house without SIL being asked. My bf even consults with her before taking some time off work since they need to coordinate taking care of in-laws. \n\nSIL always makes me uncomfortable and feel inadequate. I feel like I will never belong in the family as a daughter-in-law while she is around. It is frustrating that her husband has been long dead for over a decade and she is still keeping his family tied. I assumed she would eventually move out and get over this by getting married and getting her own life but the chances seem slim.\n\nSIL is also Iranian and while they all speak in English around me, sometimes my bf and SIL will break into Farsi while telling jokes or being overly friendly, and he looks at her with such admiration and fondness. I don't think he's ever looked at me that way. He also fondly calls her maman sometimes which means mom is Farsi. \n\nI also found out that SIL sometimes gets dizzy since her accident and once she fell down the stairs and broke her foot and had a concussion. I went to visit and she looked miserable. Apparently she had complex PTSD from the accident and getting injured really \"triggers\" her. During this time my bf carried her up and down the stairs and I saw him holding her hair and caressing it while she threw up once.\n\nThis was the final straw and I blew up at him later. I told him to stop calling her maman and being so overly intimate with her. He seemed annoyed and said this is normal in their family and I should stop telling him how to behave in his relationships since his relationship with SIL is purely platonic. He also called me jealous which made me angrier. \n\nI told him that the two of them seem more like a couple than me and him. I called him incestuous and said his culture is disgusting if this is considered normal, I know it was messed up but I was just so upset and tired of my concerns being dismissed. That really upset him and he has not replied to my texts since. \n\nMy friends think I was in the right and some said this is what happens when you date a mommy's boy from another culture. But I want an unbiased opinion so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your examples of \"inappropriate and incestuous behavior\" is just baffling. Do you even have a sibling? \nI have one brother and one BIL, if I ever get so bad that I can't walk upstairs or something equally debilitating, I don't care who of them is carrying me up the stairs because they are both my *family*, both of them are my brothers", "Your bf hit the nail on the head when he called you jealous. I'm genuinely disgusted by your attitude and lack of empathy. Gross. YTA", "YTA big time. At what point after the tragic death of her husband/their son does she stop becoming family, by your standard? Your husband views her as an older sister or even a motherly figure, and you've perverted that into something gross just because they aren't related by blood? You have issues, and you're racist.", "I wanna say YTA but I'll be soft about it. I call a lot of women in my life mom or mama. For me it's because they took care of me, I trust and admire them and love them. They accept it and love it. They've called me their daughter. And you mentioned the age gap that exists. So let's say she was around enough from that young age he was and the age she was. She was probably around often enough to help with him. That is going to help form a relationship. She's then got his trust, love (platonic) and admiration. If she got married to her late husband when they were in their 20's, she probably helped raise him. She's also been through something traumatic and is going to need help and sometimes for people, staying with the family you married into helps. Also walking on an injured foot is hell. He's helping her out and she seems to appreciate it. She hasn't objected to him calling her mom and I don't think it needs to be stopped. Although his parents are still alive, she is the functioning matriarch of the house. It does sound like you are insecure and sounding a little jealous so I'll advise you to work on that if you want to make this work. If or when you marry him, you bring your talents and help. Your contribution won't be any more or any less. If this is an opposite gender situation for you, you might just need to admit that, talk with your bf about it. As the language barrier, try learning his language if you haven't and maybe that will bring you closer. \nGood luck!", "She\u2019s been in his life since he was a child; he probably thinks of her as a sibling or mother-type figure (hence \u201cMaman\u201d).

I think you have some issues you need to work on yourself. Them being middle eastern have a completely different culture than Americans. You have to respect theirs and what they are accustomed to , you can't tell people how to live their life's.

If you can salvage the situation with your boyfriend, you know going into the situation that if something happens to him, his family is going to continue to see you as family, and maintain that relationship with you/help you care for their grandkids/etc. \n\nI hear you. There\u2019s another woman who your boyfriend looks at fondly. But I would hardly call the nickname momma sexual unless there\u2019s something kinky going on. It doesn\u2019t sound like there is.

It could simply be acknowledging her role as mother that she never got to see through. \n\nTrust me. You need to chill, OP. \n\nHolding hair while one is sick is something a sibling would do here in the states too. Even if there was some light snuggles involved, you have to keep in mind\u2026her husband and baby DIED SUDDENLY. Her future as she planned it and knew it was torn away from her. She and her husband\u2019s family could have parted ways, but they chose to continue to honor their bond moving forward. She has a home with them, and they have one provider through her and one through your man. \n\nThere is also a really strong chance that she could wind up being your best friend if you and boyfriend continue. \n\nApologize. Admit you are jealous to your boyfriend. This is a lot, but taking responsibility for the root of your action, and showing your vulnerability by admitting fault is a great way to bond with him. It also shows him that through hell or high water, you respect him and his family dynamic, even if you are struggling with it right now. Ask him to help you to find opportunities to help with his parents and be included in the family. This will work out for you MUCH better than trying to compete with their other son\u2019s widow. \n\nAlso, YTA for the racism element.

I needed help, and they all stepped up to help me.", "And she assumes that SIL is faking her CPTSD.", ">u/throwaway_familymess\n\nYTA 'm jumping onto this comment because I am in fact Iranian American, grew up heavily in the culture, and nothing OP has described is something I would consider a \"cultural norm\" of any sort.\n\nOP is a person who is resentful towards two REFUGEES and an ORPHAN who grew up with a shitty childhood, suffered a horrific accident, and lost her husband and baby. Like how do you not see you're not a good person in this nor do you have the upper hand, and you somehow keep arguing with people?\n\nSo these are some of OP's comments:\n\nas to whether she ever tried to learn Farsi:\n\n>I never needed to learn it. Everyone is fluent in English and we always speak in English. Even MIL and FIL speak in English with each other with a bit of Farsi here and there. I'm assuming they do that out of respect since I don't understand Farsi.\n\nRegarding the SIL:\n\n>She is an only child and has no parents. She was living with an aunt when she met her husband. Her parents were long dead at the time and it seems that they weren't the nicest people\n\nRegarding the parents:\n\n>MIL has heart problems and FIL is physically weak and exhausted from working a manual job for decades. Both of them came to this country as refugees from Iran and worked multiple minimum wage jobs since their early 20s. So my bf and SIL wanted to provide for them once they were old enough to make money. In-laws can still work just like countless other people do on a daily basis.\n\nLike, what? I have a highly educated mother who left Iran young after an arranged marriage. Literally one of the smartest people I have ever met. The US does not recognize Iranian degrees. Do you have any idea how heartbreaking it is to watch your extremely intelligent parents live in a foreign country that ruined your own having to work minimum wage jobs just to try and build a better life for their kids? If I could make enough to help my mom retire, I would do so in a heartbeat.\n\nAnd you are somehow so spiteful and jealous that you are now upset the parents have a son and daughter who are kindhearted and cognizant of their circumstance and want to provide them such?\n\nAnd and: no one ever said you can't be part of the family. In a decade YOU NEVER LEARNED ANY FARSI. Again, what. Based on your comments, you think maman is the equivalent of \"mommy.\" It's not. It's not some little kid version of mother, it literally means mother. Which you might know if you ever bothered to learn the language.\n\nAnd it's not weird they speak together: if you don't speak enough you lose the language. I know from experience.\n\nLastly, your in-laws offer to do things with you or create moments.\n\n>There is no space for me to be myself because I will always be compared to her. Once I offered to take my MIL out on her birthday and she said \"SIL (her name) probably has plans for me so I'm sorry. How about another day?\"\n\n1. no one making comparisons other than you. 2) the mom offered to spend time with you individually one-on-one. She did not say no. It is UP TO YOU to go out of your way and create those bonds. They don't create themselves. 3) OF COURSE SHE WILL PRIORITIZE THE SIL WHO HAS BEEN TAKING CARE OF HER FOREVER OVER YOU. She has earned her place in that family.\n\nLastly, OP, you are so beyond offensive in so many ways, I genuinely cannot wrap my head around it. Your post reeks of the western assumption that Iranians are backwater people with messed up culture. You're taking your insecurities and projecting them onto something you know absolutely nothing about.\n\nIranian culture is one of the oldest cultures still in existence. We had a democracy before the US overthrew it because the government was nationalizing oil. In 600 BC, women could own businesses and divorce their husbands. Judaism literally exists to this day because freedom of religion and culture was highly upheld in 6th century BC and the king protected Jews from persecution. So much of Western society stems from Iran. The best royal jewel collection in the world is factually in Iran.\n\nHonestly, I could go on forever on how terribly the West has rewritten history, but I could never imagine in a million. years dating someone like you who has such disdain and a lack of understanding. Idk how your bf has dealt with it this long, and I hope out of respect for himself, he does not tolerate it any longer.\n\nThere's enough racism in the US, the last thing I would want is to come home to it.\n\nETA: THANK YOU FOR THE AWARD!

And if someone suggested that remaining close to my little sister, who's known and looked up to him most of her life, was somehow perverted, I'd be haunting them till the end of time.\n\nOP, I can only hope, in my absence, that my husband and little sister would have the kind of relationship your bf and SIL share.
