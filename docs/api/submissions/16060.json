Every time she\u2019s gone on a date, she\u2019s been lying and telling me she\u2019s been out with friends or just saying she\u2019s going out. She told me she understands if I\u2019m upset with her for not telling me. I wasn\u2019t upset, I just felt it was odd because my friend will make comments about not being able to find someone or will talk about her appearance and how she\u2019s destined to be alone. \n\nShe told me her whole reason for keeping it a secret was because she was self sabotaging and embarrassed about developing feelings for someone. This is her first relationship. She told me I could ask her anything and I genuinely didn\u2019t have anything to ask. I feel it would\u2019ve been different if she had told me along the way about him and I would\u2019ve had more questions. But finding out they\u2019ve been dating for a year, I could only ask the basics like what\u2019s his name. It took her about forty mins of non-interrupted talking to tell me about him including his job, values, where she met him. So there was no info left out for me to ask about. Afterward, she asked if I wanted her to share more in the future about him and my response was, \u201csure but only if you want\u201d. \n\nI get why I may be the asshole as this may have come across as passive aggressive. But throughout her telling me about him, she talked about not wanting people to judge her or feeling uncomfortable to bring him up. So, I don\u2019t want her to feel forced to tell me.\n\nToday, she sent me a long audio note about how she feels I\u2019m not excited for or supportive of her because since that conversation on Friday, I haven\u2019t asked her about him. She said she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s something that I should be upset about because I\u2019m the first person she told and she would\u2019ve expected more from her best friend. Again, I never said I was upset nor looked like I was upset. I smiled at her and also thanked her after she initially told me. I\u2019m more so just surprised. I\u2019ve also been keeping up conversation with her since the reveal.

This whole situation is bizarre. Even if there\u2019s something objectively weird about the guy, since the reveal went well, I\u2019m not sure what she\u2019s expecting anyone to ask??", "NTA. Why would you be excited? You just found out your friend had been lying to you and hiding something she apparently thinks is a big thing from you. \nYou could have been excited for her in real time, instead it's a year old relationship and old news at this point. \n\nI get the feeling something is off here with her, like their relationship was a secret for a reason.", "NTA\n\nYour friend lives in a fantasy land were her secret lover is the biggest news in the world for everyone.\n\nYou either treat her as the main character or have to deal with constant complaints. Anyway, you will have to give all your energy there. Up to you whether is worth it.", "NTA it sounds like your friend had built up to this big reveal and felt let down by the lack of drama", "NTA. Setting aside the fact that \"being excited for someone\" is a very subjective thing it's pretty strange what's going on here. If someone else had kept something from you, then springs that without any warning whatsoever it's only natural to be cautious or confused.\n\nSetting aside the fact that one person might feel like they weren't \"trusted enough\", it is also strange that she offers to answer questions when the other person has basically no knowledge on what to base those questions on.\n\nHow is one supposed to be excited if they don't know what to be excited about?", "NTA. You were more focused on the fact that she lied and deceived you for a year.  The news that she has a boyfriend seems insignificant in comparison.", "INFO. Is there more to the reason it was kept secret for so long, like he\u2019s married, her supervisor, 40 years older, etc.? \n\nThis is bigger than keeping a secret. She repeatedly made up lies to cover it up. I don\u2019t know anyone could hear that and then shift into \u201cnormal best friend convo\u201d mode. It sounds like you did your best.", "NTA. Your friend is weird and I\u2019m shocked her relationship has lasted even a year.", "NTA. It's none of your business if she's in a relationship or not, but she told you and said that you could ask questions. If she doesn't like the level of support that you gave her, then she shouldn't have told you.", "NTA. I would understand if she decided to keep this private for a month or two, but hiding this for a whole year and making lies in the meantime is disrespectful to both you and her partner. According to her, you\u2019re supposed to be excited because you\u2019re her best friend, but who wouldn\u2019t be appalled after discovering that they\u2019ve been lied to for this long? In addition, she told you anything you needed to know, of course there wasn\u2019t any space left for questions.", "If she didn\u2019t want to talk about him- fine. But the issue to me is that she lied to you over and over and *over* again. She has a weird hang up about relationships ok, that\u2019s her business, yet she was willing to use your relationship as collateral for her choices. No matter what her reason, it was her choice to lie to you repeatedly and it was your trust and friendship she was okay with betraying. Anxiety can make you do a lot of things but it\u2019s your choices that make you who you are- and your friend\u2019s choices here are horrible.\n\nWhen you make the wrong choices and lie to someone, you have to be willing to deal with the consequences, not be upset that the person you lied to is still upset. This shows she is still trying to control the narrative and does not value your position in the friendship. I am very strongly convinced, and this is only my personal opinion, that she will lie/manipulate/disregard you again. I hope you will reconsider your friendship with someone who does not value you.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour response is appropriate to the current situation. Maybe a celebrity bf could garner more interest!", "NTA. I don't bombard my friends with questions about their partners after they tell me they have one. If she already told you about him in detail, what more would you need to know. Does she expect you to be obsessed with the fact that she got a boyfriend.", "NTA. \n\nShe wanted a lot of things at her terms. What she wants to hide, how much excitement she wants you to feel, etc. \n\nI would be annoyed that my best friend doesnt trust me enough to let me know. Like you want me to be excited for you but how did you kept all your excitement about being with someone all to yourself FOR A YEAR without telling me? \n\nShe wants to keep you out from all the going ons with her relationship, and you were just respecting your position she put you in. \n\n\"I think it would make you feel uncomfortable if i acted overly excited over the news. But i am happy for you.\" And move on with my life.", "> It took her about forty mins of non-interrupted talking to tell me about him\n\nDefinitely NTA.    What more does she expect from you?", "NTA for not responding how she thought you should.", "NTA\n\nIt doesn't sound like you're unsupportive, but it absolutely sounds like your friend is being very self-involved and thoughtless about this interaction, especially given that her relationship is not at all new from her perspective, so it's hard to even blame it on her being excited about something that has JUST happened to her.\n\nNo, you are NTA, because you ARE supportive from the sound of it, but she is asking you to be \"excited\" about something that she - your friend - has been actively and deliberately going out of her way to lie to you about for a year. She didn't just \"not tell you\" . . . she made a concerted effort to hide it from you (which fine, she's entitled to her privacy), but in the process she did a lot of things that are hurtful and not conducive to a mutually supportive friendship. And she expects you to put aside your very valid feelings about having been lied to for all this time, and just forget them and be \"excited\" for her . . . about something she didn't trust you with for a year. \n\nWhat she's asking isn't fair, and it doesn't respect YOUR right to have feelings. So no, you've done nothing wrong here, but she owes you a real, genuine apology for treating you like a receptacle for her news instead of an actual person.", "NAH. \u201cYeah, but only if you want to\u201d is a perfectly normal response to a situation in which someone has clearly felt they did not want to share information with you. You\u2019re expressing your desire not to pressure her. \n\nYou say you weren\u2019t upset about her not telling you, just confused about the things she said during this year. I have trouble reconciling that with your (apparent) lack of enthusiasm for the new man in your friend\u2019s life. \n\nSo let me ask you this, do you feel an emotional connection to your friend and interest in her love life? How would you generally express this? Do you think your reaction was different to that? Not that any of that would make you the AH.\n\nAs for your friend, it\u2019s odd behaviour from start to finish. And voice notes challenging what she perceived as your lack of unqualified support for her new situation seems unnecessary and unproductive unless this is a common way that you communicate about any perceived issues.\n\nBut if she honestly feels that way, she\u2019s not the AH either.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don\u2019t think you were insensitive or rude. There was just nothing left to ask.

What on earth would you ask about?! Heck, you didn't even know she was seeing anyone.", "NTA , seriously what did she want ? A grand boyfriend reveal party ? It's literally an year old relationship which you weren't aware of , now you just feel lied to and found out you weren't trusted enough by your best friend , maybe call her out for being nonchalant about it or she might interpret it as if you were genuinely upset or jealous that she isn't single anymore , she sounds immature .", "Yes!

That\u2019s the exact word I was looking for when explaining to her.", "I wonder if he\u2019s married.", "Ohhh that last point is a good one.", "Thank you.", "Not that she\u2019s revealed to me. He\u2019s 28, no kids, great job and they met on Hinge. I mentioned this in another comment but she\u2019s been very strict on saying she\u2019s not dating even when entertaining guys. She is religious and has a mindset of all guys only want one thing from a previous conversation with a guy. She mentioned this was why she was \u201cself-sabotaging\u201d.\n\nOne of the reasons she gave for keeping it a secret was not wanting me to think that she\u2019s having sex. She is Christian and we are both from similar immigrant backgrounds with strong values. But her parents have literally been expressing worry about her not having a bf\u2026so idk.", "It\u2019s interesting. Apparently the guy has been telling her since January to come clean to me and her family. So more evidence of him being a solid guy. I think she\u2019s just nervous.", "Thank you so much. As someone who has a lot of anxiety and often does things that are irrational, I really loved your statement about choices making you who you are.", "Thank you so much.", "Friend is TA for being deceptive to OP for a year and now expecting totally normal behavior.", "That\u2019s a good question and why I came here in the first place. Because, I know that lack of questions could be perceived as a lack of enthusiasm. I also know that my confusion can be interpreted as me being upset as well. Genuinely, I am happy for her. I think I\u2019m just confused because, she\u2019s been in a relationship with a guy who honestly seems amazing from what I hear but she\u2019s also expressed frequently within this year how she\u2019s lonely and her parents and her feel she\u2019ll never meet anyone. So it\u2019s concerning but not upsetting if that makes sense? \n\nI do feel an emotional connection to her. Some backstory is that I\u2019ve also been a dumping ground for a lot of her difficulties since high school. I\u2019ve been used to hearing any and everything. So when she brought up this idea of feeling uncomfortable talking to me, I felt I had probably done something wrong along the way. I felt in showing excitement for her on my face and also smiling and thanking her for opening up to me when she finished, I was showing this interest in her love life. But it felt different from if someone comes to you and says, \u201chey I met this guy\u201d then I could express more excitement in the way she wanted?", "I'm also confused about her whole \"don't judge me\" or whatever. \n\nLike, why did she feel she had to keep him a secret?!\n\nDid she mention if he was married, had a criminal past, drugs, baby momma? Is it like a religious thing?", "I'm almost more concerned for the guy she's been dating for a year in that case... \n\nIt's really weird to me that she would keep it a secret at all (like, fair enough to wait a few weeks to see if it's actually going anywhere and THEN tell your friends, but a whole year??) But that she's actively been going out of her way to say she is unattached and has been frankly kinda manipulative in garnering sympathy for being \"single and worried about being alone forever\".... That does not bode well for the guy she's dating. \n\nShe strikes me as the kind of person that when they break up she will villainize him and try and turn people against him for no reason. Maybe I'm being ungenerous but I've seen similar situations before and men don't have a lot of recourse or sympathy/support in those situations...", "I really feel you on that anxiety too. It\u2019s not only your choices, but if you do something you regret, it\u2019s how you recover and how you do the best you can to make better choices in the future. If you hold yourself to that standard and also hold others to that standard when it comes to how they treat you, you\u2019ll cultivate some really great people in your life. I wish you the best.", "I agree, very odd behaviour - but I was reluctant to go AH on this because it feels (and I could be wrong) like there\u2019s context we\u2019re not seeing. Why did she want to be secretive? Why did she want to be woe is me when talking to friends, if she was newly loved up?", "Totally valid. \n\nIts more like I was there for you through all your emotional sharings but how did you hide your excitement from me? And then expect me to be excited when you could hide your excitement from me? Like I would have been so happy for you to go through those days with you.", "Thanks for the additional context. That you\u2019ve been a bit of an \u201cemotional dumping ground\u201d further justifies your response. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m trying too hard to absolve your friend if straight up dishonesty but if she\u2019s been saying she\u2019s lonely and she\u2019s been in a relationship and she\u2019s been hiding it\u2026older guy, married, kids? \n\nIf it\u2019s just straight up dishonesty then I\u2019d probably change my judgment to agree that she\u2019s the AH.", "Backstory, my friend hasn\u2019t had a relationship. There have been situations where she\u2019s entertained a guy but has been very strict on not calling it dating. There was a certain guy who brought up this whole insecurity of virginity and sexuality within her. One of the things she said while telling me was that she didn\u2019t want me or others to jump to her having sex and she knows that\u2019s what people think. I\u2019ve been dating someone for about six years and asked her if that\u2019s where her mind goes whenever she sees us together and she said no. So I followed up with why do you think I\u2019d go there lol. Emphasis, we are both religious but from different religious backgrounds.", "*so happy*. One thing I brought up is how when I was a teen keeping my now fianc\u00e9 away from my parents because we weren\u2019t allowed to date back then lol, I\u2019d bring so many things up to her because I felt I could trust her and quite honestly it\u2019s exciting being in a fresh relationship and telling someone. Her response was, \u201cwell we both knew him. So your situation is different\u201d. My parents would\u2019ve literally disowned me for dating. So, I\u2019m trying to see things from her perspective but it\u2019s difficult. I think if anything this is the only statement that was a little ouch? But this came today -literally after reading your comment and reflecting", "No, I get it. I don\u2019t even think she\u2019s the AH. I get how certain things can contribute to what she referred to as self-sabotage and embarrassment in talking about a relationship. I was just more so concerned if there\u2019s anything that I did in this specific encounter that would\u2019ve made me seem like I\u2019m being the AH and showing disinterest in her relationship.\n\nThe guy is 28, so four year difference. But honestly seems amazing. Constantly taking her to things she loves to do and buying her flowers. He encourages her to open up to him and even told her how he\u2019s interested in solely just her. She even told me, they met on the app two years ago and he asked her out that Nov. but she didn\u2019t say yes until January if 2022. I had no clue about him but I genuinely think it just comes down to fear on her part.", "HAHAHA. I cant help but to laugh at how now she wants to find reasons why her relationship is different from yours, which is typical for people who just got into a relationship i guess. \n\nI think the reason why she told you now is because the excitement from the relationship has settled down and so she wants to experience another high by sharing them with you. Now you will hear about all the problems she has with her boyfriend because she needs your emotional support like how you provided her all these times.", "Your friend is a f****** idiot. Nta", "Sounds like she wants to control your reaction in every way. NTA.", "NTA sounds like your friend has a few screws loose.", "NTA. \n\nYou've got a weird friend. Also, do people send audio notes? That sounds unhinged", "NTA who would be excited that they\u2019ve been lied to you for a year? And I definitely feel like something is up with this guy, she\u2019s being very cryptic, he\u2019s either married or bad news.", "NTA. I had a friend get a new job a few years ago. She said she didn't want to say where until she started. We drifted apart, partly because she has young kids, pandemic but also because it seems weird AF that she would never say where she worked. At first I thought it was because she didn't want any of those \"oh, can you get me a job\" comments, which would never have happened but when it got to be longer and longer, it seemed weirder and weirder.\n\nThe only thing I could think of is that it was ling-term contract work and she didn't want to say. I'm not in contact with her but still think it's weird AF.", "Yep. Your clearly NTA, love, but your friend seems bonkers.\n\nMaybe stay clear of this drama unfolding for a while..", "Yeah, kinda wondering if this guy is married or an ex-con or something. Why else would she be so secretive about having a relationship with him?", "My first thought was that he was married.", "Is he her teacher or her sister\u2019s ex or something?", "Or 44!", "you are not your best friends therapist or relationship counsellor, and if she was afraid of you being judgemental does she really understand the person you are?", "Same.", "NTA.\nYour Bestfriend seems to be very insecure and is surely in need of your approval/confirmation.\nPerhaps a kind message to tell her you\u2019re happy for her but need a little time to think through it would be calming her?\n\nShe\u2019s probably anxious and pushy as a result of her insecurities and she needs her best friend to validate her.\n\nIn another hand. She should also understand that she\u2019s hidden her life from you for a whole year. Then came up with loads of information, probably too much so you couldn\u2019t process everything at once.\n\nShe should learn how to express her needs clearly to you.\nAnd she isn\u2019t morally allowed to tell you you could be upset about the year of lie and then tell you you aren\u2019t allowed to cause you\u2019re the first one she opened up to about this relationship.", "NTA. Your friend is certainly very excited, but you have no obligation to match her excitement. And honestly, why does she want you to have a million questions about him? What more is there to learn about him? His favorite brand of shampoo?\n\nI guess she envisioned this conversation going a lot different, like 2 teenagers in a movie, gushing about boys, and got upset with your \"mild\" reaction.", "I agree.\n\nA part that could be that she thinks OP is in love with her", "reading the first line I was 100% sure it must have been OP's ex. But no I don't think that anymore"]}
