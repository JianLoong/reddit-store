My shorts are almost knee length with underwear underneath.", "Yes, my friend - it would be unacceptable if the situation were reversed. So I tend to see this as a possible 'experiment' some Redditors try out, to test if there are 'double standards' in play. That's very common on Reddit, when there have been similar stories (that instead involve sexist reactions to women). \n\nThis ISN'T necessarily a real story - and indeed, some aspects sound a little unrealistic at times. For example, adding the 'what's her's' comment (and top of everything else), really just sounds like OP is upping the ante, in trying to discover 'double standards' against men (since in the female version of these stories, boyfriends feel some 'ownership' of the woman's body - and often don't want other men 'staring' because it's 'disrespectful' to the boyfriend). \n\nMaybe it's true - but most women wouldn't be concerned about that, if other women had commented on his 'endowment'. Instead, they'd be more concerned (if there really WAS 'meat on display') about the social inappropriateness of it, in front of other people - not their 'ownership' of the man. \n\nMost women don't tend to be as 'fixated' on male private parts, as a main source of 'jealousy', 'ownership', 'attraction', etc. Most women KNOW, most other women don't tend to choose men on 'endowment' - but on their more general appearance. Indeed, most women AREN'T even going to randomly comment on a man's 'endowment' to his girlfriend - especially when there's no alcohol involved in the gathering. \n\nAnd how is this bloke even managing to expose himself so much (to the point several women are allegedly noticing and commenting on it), in ordinary sweatpants and shorts?!  Unless he's endowed like an elephant, this sounds more like OP's fantasy. Most women AREN'T staring at somebody else's boyfriend's (covered) groin area, as he 'briefly' passes through - especially not to the point, they'd then comment on it to the girlfriend. \n\nMaybe this story is indeed real. But it really seems to perfectly 'tick off' the elements of stories, which involve women wearing no bra. And since that has frequently happened on Reddit before (genders being 'switched', to expose 'double standards'), I have my suspicions - especially as there are possible aspects of the story, that sound unrealistic.", "She's on team STBA so her breasts aren't prominently featured.

For whatever reason, it's the last thing that gets thought of when losing weight. \n\nNo, I don't think your junk is hanging out at all. You are decently covered by two layers of cloth. Most guys have some visible bulge in sweats and shorts that fit properly. \n\nHow defined that bulge is, can depend on the fit of the underwear as well as the age-old \"grow vs show\" situation. \n\nNot every woman understands that some men \"show\" more even when not aroused.
