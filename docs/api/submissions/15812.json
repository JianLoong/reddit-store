She just moved into my apartment 3 months ago when her rent nearly doubled at her old place. Things have been mostly ok except she has started complaining about my clothes... sweatpants and shorts specifically.\n\nPrior to meeting her,  I was severely overweight. I was dealing with a lot of depression and some past traumas that lead me to subconsciously eat myself into a blob to avoid certain kinds of attention.  She inspired me to get help and I've been doing well mentally and managing my weight over the last 2 years.  The problem is that as i get slimmer, a certain part of my anatomy shows more when i wear sweatpants or my basketball shorts.\n\nJen likes to invite her friends or family(mom and sis) over, i don't mind but I think one of them made a comment about my endowment a few weeks ago and jen had been upset ever since. I generally tend to not be in the room with them when she has guests, i might pass by them when I'm going to the gym/store/work or coming home but I'll speak to them and go in the other room for the most part. \n\nAt first she didn't say anything,  it was a look that took me a while to pick up on. But a couple of days ago,  we had a big argument.  She had her 2 bffs over and i came in from the gym wearing sweatpants,  showered and changed into shorts then went to the kitchen to grab something to eat and back to my room to game for a bit. \n\nShe came in after the friends left and  told me that she didn't appreciate me walking around with meat on display.  I laughed at first cuz i thought she was joking.  She said it was disrespectful to her friends saw it. I told her that i was clothed and in my home. Her friends didn't have to be here if it was a problem. I told her that my shorts are already a compromise because normally I'm in my boxers when I'm home. She then said that she shouldn't have to avoid having people over just because i didn't have the decency to not show off \"what's hers\".\n\nEDIT: YES I'M WEARING UNDERWEAR UNDER THE SHORTS. BOXERS OR BOXER BRIEFS. I seriously think it's weird for you all to be asking.\n\nEDIT 2: \n1. NO SKIN IS EXPOSED IT'S JUST THE \"DICK PRINT\" /BULGE\n\n2. THOSE WHO THINK I'M BRAGGING, YOU'RE SICK. I never said a size, a number... never said huge or enormous,  just more visible so you imagining any elephant trunk and thinking it's me bragging and therefore fake makes you weird af. It could be massive,  you making up things i didn't say makes me consider that you need help.\n\n3. THOSE WHO THINK WOMEN DON'T SEXULIZE MEN, YOU'RE OBTUSE\n\n4. Can't respond to comments. Didn't know i could still edit this til just now. \n\n5. I do not know if anything was said at all, I just assumed because of her behavior.  Nobody has harassed me or said anything to me beyond what my gf has said\n\nEDIT 3: I DON'T HAVE COMPANY OVER BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO. I LIKE MY HOUSE BEING A PLACE AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD. INTROVERT,  ANTISOCIAL,  PROTECTING MY ENERGY... CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT. I HAVE NEVER BEEN A \"COMPANY\" PERSON...

It likely wouldn't.  But i don't have people over so it's a non issue.", "Yeah. Fully clothed.  My shorts are almost knee length with underwear underneath.", "Yes, my friend - it would be unacceptable if the situation were reversed. So I tend to see this as a possible 'experiment' some Redditors try out, to test if there are 'double standards' in play. That's very common on Reddit, when there have been similar stories (that instead involve sexist reactions to women). \n\nSo this ISN'T necessarily a real story - and indeed, some aspects sound a little unrealistic at times. For example, adding the 'what's her's' comment (on top of everything else), really just sounds like OP is upping the ante, in trying to discover 'double standards' against men (since in the female version of these stories, boyfriends feel some 'ownership' of the woman's body - and often don't want other men 'staring' because it's 'disrespectful' to the boyfriend). \n\nMost women wouldn't be concerned about that, if other women had commented on his 'endowment'. Instead, they'd be more concerned (if there really WAS 'meat on display') about the social inappropriateness of it, in front of other people - not their 'ownership' of the man. Maybe this is all true - but most women don't tend to be as 'fixated' on male private parts, as a main source of 'jealousy', 'ownership', 'attraction', etc. \n\nMost women KNOW, most other women don't tend to choose men on 'endowment' - but on their more general appearance. Indeed, most women AREN'T even going to randomly comment on a man's 'endowment' to his girlfriend - especially when there's no alcohol involved in the gathering. \n\nAnd how is this bloke even managing to expose himself so much (to the point several women are allegedly noticing and commenting on it), in ordinary sweatpants and shorts?!  Unless he's endowed like an elephant, this sounds more like OP's fantasy. Most women AREN'T staring at somebody else's boyfriend's (covered) groin area, as he 'briefly' passes through - especially not to the point, they'd then comment on it to the girlfriend. \n\nMaybe this story is indeed real. But it really seems to perfectly 'tick off' the elements of stories, which involve women wearing no bra. And since that has frequently happened on Reddit before (genders being 'switched', to expose 'double standards'), I have my suspicions - especially as there are possible aspects of the story, that sound unrealistic.", "She's on team STBA so her breasts aren't prominently featured.

For whatever reason, it's the last thing that gets thought of when losing weight. \n\nNo, I don't think your junk is hanging out at all. You are decently covered by two layers of cloth. Most guys have some visible bulge in sweats and shorts that fit properly. \n\nHow defined that bulge is, can depend on the fit of the underwear as well as the age-old \"grow vs show\" situation. \n\nNot every woman understands that some men \"show\" more even when not aroused.

I had a partner invite friends over (both male and female). He decided to stay in his PJs, while commando, that happened to be the type that has 1 button. Problem was that the button was broken, his pants were too small, and his penis was exposed. I didn\u2019t think it was appropriate and when I expressed that he told me I was insane, jealous, etc. I proceeded to ask if he would be okay with me inviting my male friends over and having my vagina on display by wearing short, loose, shorts while commando. He couldn\u2019t grasp it. Said it wasn\u2019t the same. I encountered other major things, that I felt were disrespectful on his part, before I broke things off. Perhaps I was too conservative/too much of a prude, but I\u2019ll share and others can chime in if I was truly crazy or if you\u2019d have felt the same. Example two is he had a female friend staying with him and sleeping in his bed. She\u2019d leave her intimate items strewn all over. I told him that while I respected their friendship I was not okay with them sleeping in the same bed as I felt it was disrespectful towards me and our relationship. Especially considering they had a history. Again, I asked how he would feel if I did the same with a close male friend. His response was, \u201cit\u2019s not the same.\u201d Seriously? Another example was he had yet another lady friend who bought him something intimate. This lady friend clearly had a thing for him, yet I didn\u2019t ask him to choose.
