We both have kids from previous relationships.  I have 2 boys (12 & 10) and my wife has 2 sons and a daughter (15F, 13M, & 9M).   My wife has full custody of her kids, so they live with us.  My ex and I split custody of our sons so I have them 3 weekends a month during the school year, but during the summer they spend about 2 months with me.  \n\nFor the past 4 years, I've taken my sons on a road trip during their time with me during the summer.  I used to pick the destination myself, but now that they're getting older, we decide on a destination together and then I figure out the route and itinerary.   This is something that my sons and I really look forward to and it's a great bonding experience for us and helps us see parts of our country we otherwise might not see.  \n\nWhen my sons were with us about a month ago, we started looking into destinations for our trip this summer.  We always get really excited and animated while doing this and my step-kids took notice and started asking questions.  It evolved into us telling stories about our past trips and my step-kids all said that they want to come with too.  \n\nI tried to be as gracious as I could while explaining that this is something that my boys and I do just for us.  I told my step-kids that we can plan another trip with them and their mother for another time.  They seemed to understand in the moment, but I could tell they were disappointed.  \n\nThis past weekend I was working on our route and itinerary when my wife came to talk to me.  She said that her kids have been telling her how much they want to come on this trip with me and my sons and that they are feeling left out.  She said she doesn't want me to start playing favorites with our kids or do anything that would make her kids feel like I see them as less than my own in any way.  She stopped short of insisting that I include all the kids, but she strongly insinuated that I should take them all.  \n\nI explained to her that this is something I do just for me and my sons.  I told her I would be happy to do something similar with her and her kids as well, but this is something my boys and I do alone.  I also told her that a me doing a trip like that with 5 kids is a lot different and that if she wants her kids included, she would need to come with too.  Which is why I would want to plan something separate.\n\nI also reminded her that she does things with her kids all the time without including my sons, but she said that's different because my sons don't live with us full-time and she's never taken her kids on a trip similar to this and excluded my sons.  But that's because she's never taken her kids on a trip like this, period.    \n\n She thinks I am setting a bad precedent that will only put her kids and mine at odds because this isn't done equally.  I told her I'm not taking her kids on this trip and she told me I'm being a jerk about it.", "created_utc": 1686254904, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144jlbq/aita_for_wanting_to_keep_a_tradition_with_my_kids/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My dad lived full time with his stepkids and only had us on weekends. Being able to devote that extra special time to kids you don't have primary custody of is deeply important. It kept me from feeling replaced, which will most certainly happen if you insist on your stepkids being involved in everything. \n\nLet your wife read this: this is not about favoritism. This is about evening out the playing field. You have the step kids all the time, you don't have your bio kids nearly enough. This bonding time is very very important.", "This is a hard one but I\u2019m going NTA and I do understand why her kids feel left out but their old enough to understand that they get to see you and their mom all the time; you don\u2019t get that with your boys. I think you offered a very reasonable solution and can make a family trip out of it. Taking 5 kids in a road trip yourself would be challenging I think to say the least. It\u2019s hard integrating families but the fact that your sons don\u2019t get to spend nearly as much time with you as her children do, I think it\u2019s fair to keep the tradition. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA. Your wife\u2019s concerns about how to navigate this new combined family are fair, but your solution is also reasonable. The fact that your boys don\u2019t live with you all the time is, IMO, a good reason you *should* be able to continue this tradition with just them. \n\nI am certainly not an expert on how to integrate a family like this, but there has to be a balance of explaining to all the children that there are no favorites, but also acknowledging that there are some unique elements to both sets of kids.\n\nGood luck with this.", ">I would be happy to do something similar with her and her kids as well, but this is something my boys and I do alone. I also told her that a me doing a trip like that with 5 kids is a lot different and that if she wants her kids included, she would need to come with too. Which is why I would want to plan something separate.\n\nthis is perfectly reasonable. NTA.", "NTA. \nYour boys don\u2019t get to see you all the time. In their minds, her kids get to spend more time with their dad than they do. When I was a teen my dad lived with his new wife and her kids. So by default he went to a lot of their sports games, met their friends, all kinds of seemingly small stuff that I missed out on by being with my mom full time. Anytime I got to visit my dad they were there, which to be fair, it was their home too, but that made the time I got to spend alone with my dad was so much more treasured. \n\nBlended families are really hard, but I do think the tradition should stand and do another whole family trip if feasible. I would reco not blatantly discussing it in front of the kids not going though as they aren\u2019t at fault here. And maybe mention that to your sons as well.", "NTA\nAs you say,  the prospect of a trip with 5 kids is not the same as the prospect of a trip with 2 kids! \n\nAlso, from your sons' perspectives, they don't get to spend much time with you (and I imagine that a lot of what they do get, your step kids are there too). Whereas your step kids get to spend lots of time with their mum when no other kids are being cared for.  \n\nDunno if it helps,  but I grew up with 2 half-brothers from my dad's first marriage. They didn't live with us and would sometimes go on trips with dad on their own. It was never an issue for me. Dunno if that's just me! I'm just saying this to demonstrate that I don't think this kind of trip is unheard of for kids in blended families", "NTA, but...\n\nWhy on earth would you discuss the logistics of the trip in front of the other kids when you had no plans on inviting them? This is a lack of self awareness at best, and pure callousness at worst. You shouldn't even do this in front of adult kids, let alone minor ones. Ultimately, I think you have every right to keep the tradition going, but all the pushback you're getting is your fault for basically flaunting a trip in their face. I'm sure that wasn't your intention, but as the adult, it should have been obvious how that would be received.", "Nta it\u2019s not like you said you\u2019d never take them. Don\u2019t let the step kids intrude on one on one time with your kids.", "NTA. You can have multiple traditions. Your logic is sound. The trip would be very different with 5 kids and she would need to be there. You're offering to do other trips with them. \n\nI'm curious though; what do the boys think? Would they mind their step siblings joining? The logistics may not allow for it on this trip but going forward, if they're happy to have the other kids join then it's perhaps time to update the tradition.", "INFO: She has full custody, does that mean her kids have no bio-father involved in their lives at all? \n\nYou're not an asshole either way, but it might explain better her perspective on this.", "NTA. You wife on the other hand....This is a red flag, keep an eye out for others.", "Absolutely NTA. Your kids do not live with you permanently, and this make them more than entitled to have quality time and memories with their dad and this is what the whole family should support. Playing favorites would be treating all kids the same when they do not live the same situation.\n\nPlus I read the comment about your wife conveniently planning things when your kids are not at home. Now this is a bad precedent.", "Nta- this sub is littered with stories of poorly blended step families. You get to see your step kids all the time, it's important to make time just for your bio kids since you don't always get to see them", "NAH:  While I do understand why the kids might feel jealous of your sons I get why you would prefer to have this time with your sons. You don't see them everyday and get that one on one time with them as much as you like. So this is your chance to bond. \n\nMaybe plan something with just the step kids and than plan a huge family trip to keep things even.", "Honestly NTA\n\nYou offered to do a similar trip with the other part of the family, and while it might be a mistake to split the kids like that your right in saying that you can\\`t take 5 kids alone.\n\nAlso, I think your wifes reasoning that its okay for her to do things alone with her 3 as they live with you full time is a little shitty. Like the fact that your sons dont live with you, and hence spend less time with you, is actually more of a reason to spend this special time with them.\n\nI also reallly dont blame the kids for being upset tbh, and you WBTAH if you don\\`t try and make it up to them in some way. A good compromise might be doing a 2 week trip with just you 3, and then later in the summer doing another week with everyone?", "NTA I think it sucks for you that this situation has not possibly tainted an important tradition for you and your sons. You don\u2019t get to live with them so it\u2019s important you and them have something special that you do together when you do see them. I think you offered a reasonable solution. This is a situation where giving the kids what they need equally, doesnt necessarily mean they\u2019re given the exact same thing.", "NTA at all. If you didn't offer to take a trip with just the step kids it would be a different story. But you should be allowed to have a tradition that's just for you and your kids. Especially since you don't get to see them full time.", "I was all ready to say Y T A, but you really did come up with a fair and equitable solution.\n\nOffering a trip just for her kids as a so,union was fair. It can be their special time just like your two other sons have a special time.\n\nNTA", "Nta. You've offered to do a separate trip already and that is more than fair. Don't change this one tradition you have with your kids.", "Wow. The comments are shocking. I\u2019ll tell you as a single mom myself, I encourage you to keep the tradition with your kids as is. They need to know that although their family has grown and changed , their relationship with their dad has not. I\u2019ve seen way too many posts on here complaining of the opposite. Kids saying when my parent remarried I was forgotten or replaced or forced out of my room, etc. I think it\u2019s important for the boys to know that no matter what their bond with you does not change, but to also show the same excitement and enthusiasm to plan with the step kids, let them pick, show them some ideas etc (but maybe not things you did with your kids so they feel it\u2019s a new tradition for you and them). You got married last fall so I\u2019m guessing 3 years together, the bullshit comments of oh the step kids just realized they don\u2019t have a father now is unreasonable and ridiculous. You\u2019ve been in their lives for 3 years and they are teens- not since they were babies and you decided to cut them off. I think your plan is realistic and supportive- you can even suggest an additional family tradition, that everyone goes to, all the kids and your wife- but as a single parent mother myself, if someone asked me to change my traditions for my children, that would be a hard no. These are my kids and their lives and expectations don\u2019t have to change because I married someone new.  That\u2019s my opinion and the hill I\u2019ll die on.", "NTA. Not everything is for everyone.", " NTA. \nI think it would be to continue with this tradition because if not your sons will feel like they are being replaced. They only see you 6 days a month. Her kids get you all the time. I think it would be a great idea to keep this tradition.\n\nI am assuming she knew about this tradition so it should not come as a shock.\n\nShe can take the time your gone and plan something with her children. I think in blended families the bio parent and bio kids still need one on one time.\n\n\nEdit to add:\n\nIf you give up this trip or take the step kids with you. Op bio kids are going to grow to resent the new wife and the step kids\n\nShe should realize how hard this is on your children. She should want to show them that the new family isn\u2019t wanting to replace them in your life. Instead mom is doing the opposite she is trying to force her kids on a tradition they where not included in. By doing this she is going to take quality time away from you and your kids.", "Your kids are already at odds because they don't live together. They're barely siblings. NTA.", "NTAH\n\nComing from a blended family, raising a blended family, you are not the AH.\n\nYou offered a solution she didn't like. You've been doing this tradition with your children and they deserve to continue the tradition whether you've added to your family or not. \n\nI do this specifically with my daughter whom doesn't live with me. We do family vacations but I make sure her and I get a \"vacation\" every year just her and I. \n\nThis is your time to make memories with them because they can't be with you all the time. They also deserve this time to spend just with you.", "NTA \n\nIt's good for you to go on trips and bond with your sons. However, keep in mind that you are now a blended family and it's understandable for her kids to have felt disappointed and left out after they saw you super excited and cheering. Just make sure to not leave someone left out as that can create resentment, and that's one of the biggest relationship destroyers.", "NTA\n\nBased on the information provided, I would say that you're not the asshole in this situation. It's understandable that you have a special tradition with your sons, and it's important to maintain that bond and create lasting memories with them.

Perhaps you and your wife can find a compromise where you plan a separate trip with your step-kids and her involvement, ensuring they have their own special time with you.

He left shortly after their youngest was born and moved to a different country.", "this! everyone seems to think that being a blended family means doing everything together but that\u2019s not realistic or healthy tbh", "There have been times when she's planned outings to a zoo or fair or something else kid-friendly that I've noticed conveniently fall on weekends when we don't have my sons.  I've confronted her about it and she always has an excuse for why it falls on a weekend my boys aren't with us.", "One parent with 2 kids on a long road trip is feasible.  One parent and 3-4 kids on a long road trip is much more difficult.  One parent and 5 kids on a long road trip is a nightmare waiting to happen.  Also their bio dad left them and moved to another country, he's not involved in their lives.", "I think the objection to taking all the kids is more about logistics - I don\\`t think OP feels comfortable keeping an eye on all 5, especially considering theyre all very close in age and so having the wife come along too just kinda makes sense?", ">  Five kids between 9-15\n\nLOL, yeah there have been some battles.  My wife and I have had multiple talks with her kids about opening their home and being welcoming when my sons are staying with us.  They've struggled with that concept at times and it's definitely something we are still working on.", "Why though?  Why can't this just be for me and my sons?  I am more than willing to do something separate with my wife and step-kids.  But this tradition means a lot to me and my sons and I feel like it's important we keep it just for us.", "being part of a blended family doesn\u2019t mean you have to sacrifice all your time with your children for the sake of your new family. his wife takes the step kids on outings alone so why can\u2019t op? op also offered reasonable solutions that don\u2019t force him to take on 5 kids by himself. they should get to keep their tradition, it\u2019s only fair.", "He sees his bio kids much less often than his stepkids. Forcing them to share their one-on-one time with their father who they don't get to see that often with their stepkids who already see their father most of the time is likely to breed resentment.", "Yup! And wifey better adjust her kids expectations FAST. Her kids are NOT as worthy as yours.  Hopefully your wife's kids still have a dad somewhere. \n\nHave a great time. YTA", "Do you think the road trip lasts for the whole 2 months they stay in the summer? I'd truly be surprised if OP takes more than a week or two off work for the road trip.", "Probably be better if they don't bond. Makes the divorce much worse.", "It's not a full 2 month trip.  Depending on the destination it's been anywhere from 7-10 days.", "In my defense, I spend more time with my step-kids than I do with my own sons.", "classic redditor jumping to divorce over a minuscule issue", "Yeah, so that does explain why both the stepkids and your wife are coming in strong about this. \n\nI am on your side in keeping your own tradition with your boys. My husband and I have different things we do with different kids, and they are all our own.  No problem with that at all.\n\nBut are you unwilling to take just your stepsons (or stepkids I guess) on a road trip alone? Looks like your compromise offer was more a \"whole family\" vacation with your wife involved...? I think both the kids and your wife are wishing for a \"Dad-centric\" event, to build the relationship between just you and the stepkids.\n\nNAH.  The stepkids and your wife see something that they are envious of, because of the bio-dad being a no show to them. They're not assholes at all.", "This right here and given her attitude about this trip sends up red flags.\n\nShe wants you to replace your kids with hers. she is trying to drive a wedge between you and her kids. I wonder how she treats your kids when your not around? It may be worth asking your boys.\n\nHowever I would seriously re think this marriage. If your new wife has her way she will make your boys feel like they are no longer welcome in your life. This will cause a rift with your children. And potentially cause you to loose them. I start reevaluating this relationship fast before she causes damage that can\u2019t be undone.", "You should add this to the post, she only plans activities when its not your weekend with the kids(how convenient). Your step kids live with you, your sons don\u2019t! It\u2019s important for you to keep this tradition, and have alone time with your kids. If in the future your sons want to invite your step kids, that would be their choice.", "That\u2019s not the same thing as purposefully planning something that excludes your kids. You don\u2019t have them all the time, there are going to be weekends where you do things with her kids when yours aren\u2019t there. It\u2019s not the same thing as planning a camping trip that excludes half of your family. \n\nWith that said, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA and you should keep your tradition. But the reason your wife is asking you is because you planned this awesome fun trip *in front of her kids* that explicitly doesn\u2019t include them and they\u2019re now sharing with her that they feel sad that they haven\u2019t been invited. You could have easily avoided this by having a conversation with your wife about it in advance and not talking about it in front of her kids. You might not be wrong in doing something with just them but from your step kids perspective it feels like you\u2019re throwing it in their face that they can\u2019t do this super fun thing and your wife is responding to their hurt feelings. She\u2019s right that it could put your kids and hers at odds, which is why having conversations about it in advance would have been ideal.", "So when your real kids are there, she includes them in everything and doesn't rub their noses in all the fun stuff HER kids do that they don't get to participate in?\n\nShe sounds like a really good mom *and* a good stepmother.", "Wife's kids are likely a bit insecure/envious that your biological sons have a father that loves/involved in their lives.  Their father abandoned them.  Just keep doing what you're doing, you are NTA for wanting to continue the traditional trip with your sons, which you were doing for years.", "Why should you not exclude members of your newly formed family? Is that what you\u2019re asking?", "Why should it be? You are part of a larger family now, why keep a tradition that's needlessly divisive?", "it seems like you skipped over most of the content in this story. op offered a trip for all of them as he can\u2019t be responsible for 5 kids on a road trip. he should be allowed to have one thing for him and his kids especially bc he\u2019s with his stepkids more than his bio kids", "Okay so... make it a 2 week trip where for half you are with you bio sons and your wife is with her bio kids then you meet up and spend the rest of the trip back. You can adjust a tradition to not leave out the family you *chose* to be apart of while not sacrificing the bonding time with your boys.", "You had to plan this way too cool trip including tales of REALLY GREAT past trips IN FRONT of the ones who will be left behind . . . \n\nFor that reason YTA.\n\n(Come look at our pictures of when we went to Disneyland!]", "I get it, but the kids won't.", "He said he was unwilling to take all 5 on his own, which is definitely fair that's a lot of people to manage", "Kind of sucks the step kids now realized they don't have a father.\n\n\"I explained to her that this is something I do just for me and my sons.\"\n\nOP doesn't consider his wife's two boys his sons or the daughter. OP falls into a category of only blood determines family. It really hurts kids to realize they will always be second to their parents.", "No, she doesn\u2019t \u201conly\u201d do that. OP says \u201cthere have been times\u201d, which is incredibly normal when there are some weekends where he doesn\u2019t have his kids.", "Exactly what I was going to say.", "Because even if they are a newly formed family his bio kids need to know dad isn\u2019t replacing them. They need one on one time with thier bio family.\n\nThe solution is for mom to plan something with her kids. I am sure that would be good for them too. \n\nThey are not excluding them from everything. Just one trip!", "Like I said in the post, I am more than willing to plan a separate trip that includes everyone.  But I want this tradition to remain just me and my sons.", "Because I only see my sons for a fraction of the time I spend with my step-kids.  This trip is pretty much the only time the entire year that is spent just me and my sons and it's incredibly important to me that it remain that way.  The father/sons bonding that we do on this trip is something that we don't get during any of our other time together.", "That's a very simplistic way of looking at this.  Figuring out the logistics of something like you suggested would be very difficult.  Some of the trips have been almost 2,000 miles round trip and to remote areas.  Not exactly the kind of thing my wife and step-kids could just meet us halfway on.", "he shouldn\u2019t have to change this tradition just because they want to be included. op offered a reasonable solution and said they could plan a separate trip all together, this should be just for him and his sons. he\u2019s not leaving them out, he sees his stepkids more than his children, he should be allowed to have one trip with them alone. being part of a blended family doesn\u2019t mean you have to do everything together and his wife takes the step kids on outings alone, why can\u2019t op?", "Then it is the job of me and their mother to help them understand.", "Neither will his bio kids when dad stops this tradition. They are already probably a little insecure having to share dads time. Now mom and stop kids want to take one more thing from them.\n\nHow is it fair to them? It\u2019s thier dad. They are already having to share him.", "Yeah, I am meaning here that he could do a separate road trip with just his stepsons (that's 2), or all the step kids (that's 3).  \n\nThat would allow him to keep his traditional roadtrip as is, while building the new relationships.", "When kids write in to AITA asking if they're the asshole for wanting time with just their parent without their stepsiblings or stepparent, we call parents TA for NOT doing things with just their own kids. Having time with just your own bio parent and not always having to have the stepsibs along is important.", "Oh please, I spend more time with my step-kids than I do with my bio sons.  And it's not even close.  I get around 120-130 days a year with my sons.  I get 365 with my step-kids.", "It must be a lot for op to question her why these events fall when the boys are not with him. Because he said she always has an excuse.", "The most important trip apparently. It\u2019s very cruel. OP is the asshole.", "And that makes you the asshole.", "Why?", "This is not a zero sum game. You can spend time with everyone.\n\nIf you think maintaining distinct sub groups within the family is \"incredibly important\" then you're an asshole.\n\nYou also have three other kids you need to bond with too.", "So don't plan a 2k round trip to a remote place. You clearly  want this to be some impossible problem that cannot be solved. Well it can, if you were willing to put in a little effort. Would it be more complicated? Yea, but you chose to create a more complicated family and this is the consiquence of that. Did you just come here to get strangers online to soothe you and tell you that you don't have any responsibility to your step kids feelings so you can do what you clearly have already decided on without feeling guilty?", "Then he shouldn't have planned it infront of them and then told them how cool and fun it was. He created this problem, he needs to find the solution. And I'm not suggesting he cut his time with his sons short, I'm suggesting he extend the experience to include them without sacrificing that quality time. There are many solutions where neither set of kids feel replaced or second best that OP is just unwilling to entertain.", "This 100 percent!", "That\u2019s a fun assumption.\n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t think he needs to take the kids. I just think he fucked up talking about how great this trip will be in front of them. Of course they feel sad and left out and of course their mother wants to alleviate that.", "It\u2019s very cruel to expect bio kids to just give up everything.  Op is came up with solutions. Mom needs to plan a trip with her kids.\n\nThe bio kids need this. Op needs to continue this tradition.\n\n\nI don\u2019t have step kids but my husband plan different trips with different kids. It\u2019s a way to connect with those kids. Every parent does it. It doesn\u2019t make it cruel to give each kid a personalize trip.\n\nIt would be cruel if op never did anything with the step kids but right now his boys need to realize that his new family isn\u2019t replacing them.", "Did your step daddy hurt you?", "This is a bad take.", "He only wants his REAL KIDS. Not his wife's kids. \n\nIt's him and *his sons* bonding and being men, men can't bond with *step sons*. Duh.", ">You also have three other kids you need to bond with too.\n\nI spend more time with my step-kids than I do with my bio sons.  By a long shot.  Which is why keeping this trip just for me and my sons is so important to me.", "he was wrong for that aspect but that still doesn\u2019t mean he has to change his tradition for them. your suggestion was unrealistic and doesn\u2019t account for all of the nuances that come with a road trip. and again, op offered to plan a separate trip, they don\u2019t need to change this specific trip/tradition. if op bends on this, he will be doing his children a major disservice and it will leave them feeling replaced. no matter how you spin it, involving the step kids will result in him sacrificing time with his kids.", "I can agree it should have never been mentioned in front of the kids. \n\nBut for him to question still makes me wonder also. How many times have we seen where step moms slowly start pushing the bio kids away to favor her too?\n\nIf I was op I would be careful and watch closely too.", "Nobody is asking kids to give up anything. I\u2019ve already voted, thanks", "What a strange question. It\u2019s a good thing I don\u2019t have an abusive stepfather. That would have seemed needlessly cruel. Was that your intention?", "I forgive you", "That makes no sense. The one shouldn't impact the other.", "The bio kids need this because they spend almost no time with the father.\n\nThe step kids spend more time with OP than his own bio kids.\n\nHe needs time where its just him and them", "You are angry at the stepdad for what he\u2019s doing. Seems pretty personal. SMH!", ">That makes no sense\n\nThen I cannot help you.", "It absolutely does. The bio kids get barely time with dad. The step kids see him more.", "Eh, it makes perfectly sense in my pov", "it makes perfect sense. what part don\u2019t you get? ops kids deserve time with him and he shouldn\u2019t be forced to watch over 5 kids to do that.", "All the kids will get to go. Win win.", "I\u2019m not angry at anybody. Have a nice day.", "Except you're ignoring the issue that OP has less time with his bio kids than his step kids.\n\n6 days a month and the summer. Step kids get him every day except on this trip.", "that\u2019s only a win for the wife and her kids. op\u2019s kids lose out on the trip with their dad and op suddenly has to watch over 5 kids. let them have their tradition."]}
