We allow the grans to have him for sleepovers every other weekend. I stress this is to placate them, NOT because we need a 'night off/free babysitter'. I prefer him with us personally, for a variety of reasons.\n\nK said at last weekends sleepover that nan(mother-in-law, 'G') let him sleep in her bed with her all night. I thought this was a) weird and creepy and b) not in line with what we are trying to achieve at home and had already asked the nans prior to show some tough love and have K sleep in his bed when staying over their place.\n\nI called G up and she was out with friends having lunch and it was a respectful call to remind her to not let K sleep in their (grandparents) bed and make sure to instead keep our routine going-read to K in his bed, sing a nursery rhyme, tuck him in and make sure he sleeps in his bed.\n\nG was quite short with me on the phone and gave generic 'fine' 'ok' answers and said she had to go as she was at lunch.\n\nI wanted to confirm if she was picking him up or if we were dropping him over but then realised she had left. She clearly had not hung up as intended, but just presumably sat the phone on the table and left it going.\n\nAfter a bit of back and forth with her friends at the table about being disrespected by us, and not putting up with it anymore, she dropped the below nasty line (the audio is very feint and hard to hear but the gist is below).\n\n**'....see, he's (me) such a prick, he'd (be so happy so get me out of the picture???), he wants to control her (my wife, her daughter), he's a horrible prick'**\n\nNow, keep in mind i live in a small town and have recently quit my job and am looking for work locally, so this really upset me. Some of her friends could be hr managers/owners/wives of owners of places i am applying for and shit like this can essentially get you black listed. Purple-monkey-dishwasher and word gets around i mistreat my wife and kids and am an abusive alcoholic.\n\nI believe i have been a model husband to her daughter, i have put a roof over her head, given her a healthy son (born in wedlock), and until recently have been the main breadwinner. G has justed hated from day dot.\n\nMy question is, do i confront G with this recording? Or am i just the asshole for essentially listening in to what G thought was a private conversation between friends??\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE-**\n\n1-People seem to be getting a bit mixed up with the line about the 'model husband to her daughter' bit.\n\nI probably didn't word that right, but i do think it makes me, on the surface, a model SON IN LAW.\n\nAgain, the point of all that antiquated nonsense is that G is old fashioned and those things mattered to her. I could understand her holding a grudge against me and running my name through the mud with her friends if we eloped, or i had knocked up her precious virtuous daughter before we had taken our vows of the utmost holiest matrimony, or if we had an 'alternative' lifestyle.\n\nI wouldn't agree, but i'd getit.\n\nI was trying to get across i don't know where this irrational hatred of me comes from, i've paid my dues and deserve, at least, faked respect, much like the same i show her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2-I make the hard calls with G because of past tension with my wife and her mother. Tension is an understatement. Not the time and place to go into specifics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3-Yes, i love my wife and my son. Kinda weird and depressing that needs to be said. I married my wife because i love her, that's what marriage is (for me at least) and my son-my son is everything.Period. His favourite song i sing to him, everynight (unless im working late) is 'you've got a friend in me'. He is my best friend and i am nothing without him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4-I did not record at the start, i did after she started spouting nonsense about being a babysitter on-call 24/7 to her friends to garner sympathy. This is so false it's laughable and i was recording that so we (my wife and i) could roll our eyes and laugh later on about how absurd it is, and then the shit flinging started.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5.I did not know my mil was out at lunch when calling her.\n\nI only found out when after we talked about the sleep situation with K she said words to the effect of 'anyways i'm at at lunch atm and need to get going' as a phonecall bookend at which point i said no prob, i'll see you later on this afternoon'.", "created_utc": 1678326164, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11mf2t1/aita_i_recorded_my_motherinlaw_telling_her_circle/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Again, that was aimed at trying to see from G's point of view, i've earned my stripes as a son in law so to speak-i've done right by her by doing right by her daughter and grandson. \n\nIn other words, i deserve some god damn f\\*\\*king respect for not being a deadbeat dad and don't appreciate getting shit talked behind my back to half the town(which is what it may as well be when the gossip train gets going).\n\nI do not use K as a 'plaything'. I allow him to spend the night with the nans because it's healthy for him NOT because my wife and i need a night off.", "How did she \"overstep\"? She should have respected OP's rule the first time but she didn't argue with OP about it. It's not disrespectful to not like a family member and discuss your dislike with your friends. She didn't say these things to OP or his wife. She said it to her friends.", "It sounds like the MIL does know what she's talking about. He thinks that he's the reason his wife gave birth to a healthy baby. Never mind that OP's wife spent nearly a year following dietary restrictions, taking vitamins, enduring countless doctors appointments, not to mention the hell that is childbirth. No, it was OP's sperm that brought this healthy cold into the world. Would you be a fan of someone who says something like that?", "It would most likely be illegal even in single party consent states because OP wasn't part of the conversation between his MIL and her friends.

He's now in prison. For similiar abuse.  \n>  \n>I can appreciate people like to take a story such as this and make assumptions like the above 'your wife won't like that etc' or that 'you don't love your wife cause you didn't say you love her!' but man, can we dial back the headcannon a bit?\n\nJust cool it with the assumptions please?\n\nI appreciate the posts which are based on the facts given, like the fact it may actually be illegal. I hadn't honestly thought of that and that's a valid point.\n\nI think people would be a little less quick to judge if they had just heard a family member, who they thought they got along reasonably well with (at worst neutral) run them down, in real time, while hearing it and then being in the rock and hard place scenario of what do i do with this new(illegal?) information.", "This- my first reaction to this whole situation is why didn\u2019t OP say oh OK, we can talk later and hang up?", "OP didn\u2019t pick a more opportune time because a man needed to say something.

Women are too emotional for these things. Best for them to bear sons and stay home.", "Yeah thats why that line stuck out to me.", "AAAHHHH. I gotcha.

And for what purpose do you have a recording app on your phone anyway?

Nor do I think would she want to as it would affect her daughter and her grandchild. I doubt you are topic of conversation often if at all. You just happen to call and corrected her while she was enjoying herself with her friends. \n\nSomething about your call to her didn\u2019t go well. Your tone, attitude or what you said obviously put her off. That\u2019s human and it\u2019s human to talk crap about the caller that somehow antagonized her. \n\nWhat\u2019s is super creepy is that your reaction was to record her with an app you already had on your phone. Whatever you think is a good idea to do with that recording, STOP. You are incorrect. Delete it.

You call yourself a model parent, yet you\u2019re allowing your son to spend extended of time with a woman who traumatized her own children. Make it make sense. \n\nThe reason I said your wife wouldn\u2019t like what you did is because most people think it\u2019s wrong to record someone without their consent.

My first impression is total agreement with MIL. Sounds like an accurate assessment of the OP.", "Sorry but no. \nNot being a dead beat means you don\u2019t get contempt. \nGetting respect requires more than that and a couple of cuss words. \n\nYou interrupted her lunch with friends to correct her and judging from this comment, you probably WERE a prick. I\u2019d talk shit about you too. \n\nNext time, wait til you see her again and remind her about the rules. Don\u2019t call her up with this mouth of yours, have a creepy recording app on your phone and record it. \n\nSimmer down", "I think there's dislike and then there's spreading rumours.

WTF?", "OP, everyone on this thread most likely knows how it feels to find out that someone you get along with secretly hates you. This is not a unique situation that no one else but you can relate to. The reason people are coming at you so hard is because you\u2019re coming off as very self righteous.

No, that's no fun, we like to come up with our own version of events in our head and then make judgements based on that, facts be damned.", "She wasn\u2019t spreading rumors.

That would be on her friends for breaking her confidence. Your MIL is not your PR rep.

Why would you allow your child to spend any time with this woman unsupervised? To make it even worse, you are asking this woman, who most likely doesn\u2019t have empathy or patience when it comes to kids, to participate in your son\u2019s sleep training. What makes you think that an abusive mother is the right person to help break a three year old out of a habit? I don\u2019t have an agenda and I have no knives drawn.
