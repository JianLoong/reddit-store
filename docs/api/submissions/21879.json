While on vacation, she would ask me daily to carry things in my purse for her (cell, keys, wallet, etc) or she'd ask my son to carry things in his pockets.

At that point, she'll ask me. Our daughter offered she could have one of her purses since our daughter basically collects them, but she said that purses are too feminine for her. I've asked her why she doesn't just bring what she needs with her and she explained that sometimes what she needs for a day out is more than what fits in her pockets.

Backpacks and drawstring bags just like the one OP offered. They carry the same amount, if not more, stuff as a bigger purse, don't get in my way, and can be either as cute/feminine or as sporty/masculine as you can imagine.
