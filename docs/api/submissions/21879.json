While on vacation, she would ask me daily to carry things in my purse for her (cell, keys, wallet, etc) or she'd ask my son to carry things in his pockets.

At that point, she'll ask me. Our daughter offered she could have one of her purses since our daughter basically collects them, but she said that purses are too feminine for her. I've asked her why she doesn't just bring what she needs with her and she explained that sometimes what she needs for a day out is more than what fits in her pockets. A lot of the pants she wears have normal pockets, not that ridiculous half pocket a lot of women's pants have.\n\nI bought her a plain blue drawstring sports bag and gave it to her telling her she could use it to carry her things around and I would pay to personalize it for her if she wished. She refused it and said she already said that purses are 'too girly' for her, and I pointed out that this wasn't a purse, it's a sports bag, and both men and women use these for carrying things. They've not come out with us since and my son says they're both still upset with me for trying to 'feminize' her.

I don't like having to carry the smaller ones because I like having both hands free. The one-shoulder/arm ones annoy me because they're always slipping and sliding. The cross-body ones don't look good when you shorten them to waist-height and tend to flap against/sit on my hip in a way that I dislike. I don't judge anyone who uses such bags or purses, and I often envy the aesthetic of a good purse. They just aren't for me. \n\nMy solution? Backpacks and drawstring bags just like the one OP offered. They carry the same amount, if not more, stuff as a bigger purse, don't get in my way, and can be either as cute/feminine or as sporty/masculine as you can imagine. I can fit everything I need for any given outing and then some in a standard drawstring bag or a small backpack. I even started regularly using one of those Herschel fanny packs as a cross-body satchel for warmer days when I didn't want the weight of the backpack on my back and all I really needed was my phone and wallet. \n\nThere is absolutely no need to pull the \"not like other girls\" nonsense by behaving as if any & every bag, and anyone & everyone who carries one, is inherently feminine. *Especially* if you make a habit of carrying too much stuff for you to actually handle and then making it other people's problems by demanding that they hold it for you.
