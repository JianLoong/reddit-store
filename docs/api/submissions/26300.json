(7 people)", "selftext": "**(6 people, not 7)**\n\nIt has been a very dramatic couple of weeks.\n\nI am currently on holiday in my country of birth. I suggested an old friend of mine join me to get dinner. He asked me whether he could bring 3 women and a man he is cool with, which I agreed to. I also suggested we go to the place I rented after dinner as it was pretty nice.\n\nI suggested the restaurant, and everyone was fine with the location. We got there and everyone started ordering and ordering, cocktails, lobster, sushi... everything was fine, we were having a laugh.\n\nThe bill came. It was 770\u20ac. I told my friend we should all split evenly, he was cool with it, and the other guy said he was kind of broke right now and could only spend 25\u20ac despite eating close to 100\u20ac worth of food or more. I knew things were about to go south.\n\nTwo of the women were on their phones silent and disengaged, and the other woman had the audacity to openly and confidently suggest I be a gentleman and cover the bill as \"You are clearly doing better\".\n\nI asked her why she'd assume that and she said \"That's what it seems like on IG\". Mind you, all I have on my IG are pics of holidays and business-related stuff. No fast cars or any of that.\n\nI told them that I didn't know them and that this was not a date. She said that they didn't expect to have to pay. My friend said he isn't dating them either, he met them all at work.\n\nI was getting upset at the entitlement and asked my friend whether he told them anything pointing towards me paying, he said he didn't and that each of them always pays for their own things. I suggested he deal with them as he invited them over.\n\nIt became a back and forth with the three of them of \"too expensive\", and \"not fair\"... It was fair when they were ordering like they had a money fountain clearly, but not when it was time to pay.\n\nI got fed up and said that I was not even going to split it evenly anymore and just cover my spend (52\u20ac) and that I was going home on my own, which seemed to offend them even more than splitting the bill.\n\nI stood up, went to the counter, told the waiter what I consumed and that each would pay for their own stuff, paid and went back to the table. Apparently, aside from my friend, none of them had enough for the bill, or so they said. I felt a little bad as they were trying to figure out how to pay, but I ultimately didn't and instead, I ended up being petty and giving a big tip to the waiter in front of them.\n\nHad they not been entitled about it and said it before agreeing to come, I would have at least considered it.

Maybe my buddy who was going to pay forgot about a utility bill and on short notices tells me they can't. No problem, I've got myself covered.\n\nI am also  baffled that OP's bill came out to 52\u20ac and the even split was 110\u20ac.", "Same. I rarely go out to eat because of a combination of food allergies and finances. But when I do accept I always assume I\u2019m paying as well. It just seems like the safe thing to do, and avoids any drama from misunderstandings. Well, except for one friend who insists on buying coffee for the whole group  after our Sunday morning runs. That\u2019s been going on for years and he absolutely will not let anybody else in the group even think about paying. That\u2019s the singular exception. If he ever wakes up one Sunday morning and decides he\u2019s done buying coffee I will certainly miss having the little treat, but there\u2019s no scenario where any of us would think we were entitled to it. We would all just pay for our own coffee. And his too if he\u2019d let us.", "ignore him. the audacity to assume you were paying is something else. especially when they went and ordered at least twice as much as you to end up with a 770 dollar bill", "Few people are more entitled than those who assume they're going to eat on someone else's dime.", "Thanks for the kind words. When I was younger, I'd have struggled a bit with it. But for better or worse, this kind of situation is not a first and I learnt how to deal with it. They made it easier by acting entitled.", "Here, you dropped these:\n\n*n't*", "I mean, it seemed kinda weird to ask four random people to join an old friend for dinner, but I guess if OP was more interested in a fun night out on the town than on a quiet chance to chat, that was cool.\n\nThe friend backed OP all the way, at least.  I do kinda wonder how the friend suggested this if all four of the folks had the impression that OP was paying.  One moocher, I could explain away.  Four makes you wonder how it was pitched.", ">I am also  baffled that OP's bill came out to 52\u20ac and the even split was 110\u20ac.\n\nIt's even worse when the split bill is double what you ate.", "I'm a huge people pleaser and push over, so I get it! Good for you setting and holding your boundaries , OP!", "I haven't been able to read all the comments, but I'm glad his friend backed him! \n\nAnd definitely bring some friends if they're looking for that kind of night, I agree! If they expected OP to cover dinner, would they also expect him to pick up the tab at a bar or club? Unless this was discussed ahead of time and OP offered, that's different.  But when you go out with friends to dinner or a bar, I always thought the default was paying for yourself. In this case, OP never offered or said he'd cover soooo default social norms say, everyone pays for their own dinner/drinks.\n\nYes, one moocher is expected, not the whole lot of them, haha \ud83d\ude06", "Drinks particularly cocktails add up quick. Didn't notice the country but you can prob average \u20ac12-\u20ac15 in many cities in Europe so only takes 3-4 of these per person during a slap up meal to really drive up the bill.", "Yeah, if I thought somebody was paying for my meal, I'd be watching what they order and follow suit."]}
