(7 people)", "selftext": "**(6 people, not 7)**\n\nIt has been a very dramatic couple of weeks.\n\nI am currently on holiday in my country of birth. I suggested an old friend of mine join me to get dinner. He asked me whether he could bring 3 women and a man he is cool with, which I agreed to. I also suggested we go to the place I rented after dinner as it was pretty nice.\n\nI suggested the restaurant, and everyone was fine with the location. We got there and everyone started ordering and ordering, cocktails, lobster, sushi... everything was fine, we were having a laugh.\n\nThe bill came. It was 770\u20ac. I told my friend we should all split evenly, he was cool with it, and the other guy said he was kind of broke right now and could only spend 25\u20ac despite eating close to 100\u20ac worth of food or more. I knew things were about to go south.\n\nTwo of the women were on their phones silent and disengaged, and the other woman had the audacity to openly and confidently suggest I be a gentleman and cover the bill as \"You are clearly doing better\".\n\nI asked her why she'd assume that and she said \"That's what it seems like on IG\". Mind you, all I have on my IG are pics of holidays and business-related stuff. No fast cars or any of that.\n\nI told them that I didn't know them and that this was not a date. She said that they didn't expect to have to pay. My friend said he isn't dating them either, he met them all at work.\n\nI was getting upset at the entitlement and asked my friend whether he told them anything pointing towards me paying, he said he didn't and that each of them always pays for their own things. I suggested he deal with them as he invited them over.\n\nIt became a back and forth with the three of them of \"too expensive\", and \"not fair\"... It was fair when they were ordering like they had a money fountain clearly, but not when it was time to pay.\n\nI got fed up and said that I was not even going to split it evenly anymore and just cover my spend (52\u20ac) and that I was going home on my own, which seemed to offend them even more than splitting the bill.\n\nI stood up, went to the counter, told the waiter what I consumed and that each would pay for their own stuff, paid and went back to the table. Apparently, aside from my friend, none of them had enough for the bill, or so they said. I felt a little bad as they were trying to figure out how to pay, but I ultimately didn't and instead, I ended up being petty and giving a big tip to the waiter in front of them.\n\nHad they not been entitled about it and said it before agreeing to come, I would have at least considered it.

The thought being that the first decline gives them an opportunity to change their mind, if they didn\u2019t really want to.", "Exactly, thank you !!", "So am I weird for being of the mindset that if they said they'd pay, then that means not to even look at the prices at first?\n\nLike, I'm not looking for the most expensive thing or the cheapest thing, I'm looking for the thing that sounds like it'd taste good. I'll check the price *after* I decide it sounds good, and if it's super expensive, ask if they're okay or if they'd prefer me to get something cheaper, but I'm never going to look at the price first.", "I find it wild too even though I don't look for the cheapest thing.  I always just get whatever entree I'd get no matter who pays.  Appetizers, drinks, and desserts depend more on what the one paying seems to be getting though.", "That's crazy, because if I'm not paying I usually give my order to the first homeless person I see on the street.", "If for some reason I know I am not paying I make sure to order something just slightly less expensive than what the host orders. If I think ordering the cheapest item will make a comment.", "exactly. Common courtesy when someone is treating you is to find the cheapest thing on the menu, then move up in price untill you find something you like.", "What a lovely gesture! The greatest kindness is the one least expected.", "I hope you don\u2019t still feel like a monster\u2026 he could have backed out of paying for it at any time, when they brought him the bill and he saw how much it was he was cool with it. I\u2019ve done something similar for friends - the intention and the joy of it is for my friends to be happy and have what they want. \n\nI know you know that, but still\u2026", "This scenario is the primordial soup in which social anxiety is born.", "Trust me don\u2019t feel like a monster. I\u2019ve been on both sides of the table- went out for a bite to eat at our local restaurant with some friends after work. Wasn\u2019t super expensive (likely \u00a3100) but I had gotten luck that week and we were all fresh out of uni and on our butt. I just got the bill for the table as I lived with some and they all mean a lot to me. We generally thought not much of it but I know they appreciates the gesture.\n\nOn the other side, my SO comes from significantly wealthier family than me. We visit them abroad once or twice a year since we started dating 3 years ago and every time the Dad is always footing the bill. I feel awful and don\u2019t want to come across as entitled so am always being very thankful.\nI\u2019ve found a good way is to offer to pay the tip, as he\u2019s actually at this point mentioned to me to stop thanking him after dinner lol. \nIt was worst when her brother in law was there also, mans 15+ years my senior and had his 3 kids. Known them long enough and was able to insist on paying for dinner once or twice. Likely just an ego thing but it made me feel even leechier lol", "When my wife and I were dating she was working at the corporate office of a big multinational firm (I won't say too much more for privacy reasons)\n\nShe was by no means an executive, she was pretty low on the totem pole, but her job of managing their fleet of vehicles had her working on the same floor as C levels.\n\nWe went to dinner with some friends near her work and she bumped into one of the C levels whom she was on a first name basis with.  She had a polite chat and our parties went on with our dinners.\n\nSame deal, queue up us asking about the bill, turns out the C level had paid for us (including a few drinks we had ordered)\n\nWas a rather nice surprise", "This is so sweet.", "There's no need for you to feel like a monster!  That was a lovely gesture for him to do.", "Something similar happened to me a few years ago - my girlfriend was planning to take me out to a steakhouse for a birthday dinner, and my dad, trying to be nice, said he would cover the bill. I said he didn't need to do that, and that he could take me out another time. A couple days before my birthday, we were able to change the upcoming reservation from a week or so after the actual date to the night before, and I was excited about it so I let him know. He repeated his offer, which I declined again.\n\nWe get to the restaurant, we have our meal, it's delicious, we decline the dessert menu and we're waiting to pay... and waiting... and waiting. Finally, I flag down the server, and he says \"Captain Kirk has covered your bill tonight.\"\n\nIt is at this point that it's important to know that my dad is a big Star Trek fan.\n\nHe managed to call the restaurant and somehow put his card down to pay for my reservation! I was, like, jokingly mad at him for it in the moment, and now it's just a fun story to tell.", "You're fine, you ordered what you ordered, fully expecting to pay for it yourselves, and gave your friend the opportunity to be extra generous.", "I've done that with family, too.  For example, one year, we were out for a Father's Day lunch where my stepdad and brother-in-law were present, in addition to my mom, my sister and me.  We weren't anyplace expensive - really, it was a very nice diner is all.  But my family never lets me pay no matter how much I insist (*I'm the youngest and they honestly still act like I'm a kid with no job*), so I figured out a plan to get the bill.\n\nAs I saw the waitress approaching, I waved her over, and asked in a normal tone of voice, \"Could I please see the bill? I think I accidentally ordered something more expensive than I should have...\"  She handed the bill to me - I thanked her, grabbed my wallet and scooted up to the register and paid for the table.  I got back and they were all, \"HEY!!  You can't do that, let us know how much that was so we can chip in, etc.\"  I laughed and said, \"Too bad, it's done!\"\n\nI then pointed at my BIL and my stepdad and said, \"And it's Father's Day -  we're not going to let you pay, or you.  Mom and Sister shouldn't have to pay for it, because none of you let me ever reach for my wallet when we go out.  So this time, I just decided I was paying.\"  It felt great!\n\nI also high-fived the waitress on my way back to the table and left her a generous tip.  I think she figured out what I was trying to do, because if memory serves, there was a brief moment when my BIL tried to snag the check as she was handing it to me, and she kind of played \"keep away\" from him and handed it to me.", "Good gracious- Did you hear that in the US a GLASS OF WATER is $9 at some places?!?!  Check my comment post history!  I was absolutely astonished.  And fizzy water? $12/glass.\n\nI'm sorry, but that is insane.", ">*Maybe it depends on the company?*\n\nI think so.  I was always taught to wait for the host (or the person paying) to order first, then order something in that same price range or a little less.", "This is what I do.  I ask what other people are ordering, note if they're getting alcohol, and keep my entr\u00e9e within a few dollars of their entr\u00e9e.  I also don't typically get alcohol, which keeps my total lower.  If whoever is paying asks about appetizers, I will offer a suggestion, but I'm not going to order one without the payer's okay.  This applies if a friend is paying for me, or if it's on my company's dime.  I only splurge if I'm paying and can afford to do so.", "In those situations i've found that the person will say \"get whatever you want, don't worry about it\" as the permission to get something nice.", "From the other side of that coin, if I'm offering to buy you dinner, it's like a gift, and I want you to have a good experience, regardless of the money.  The whole idea is to let you have the best meal possible with no stress for how it gets paid for.\n\nSo I want you to order what you want most.  If that's a middle of the road thing, that's fine, if it's the priciest thing on the menu, let's do this.  Ordering the cheapest thing out of concern for my wallet kind of misses the point of what I'm trying to do here.", "I learned later in life that he's actually dumb wealthy from a few lucky breaks early on - working at a store giving him stock as pay worth about $2.50 a share got bought out by a fortune 500 company at over $100 a share. He got 150 years worth of his pay in a single day. The check he picked up for me as a child was three days work for me, but less than half hour of interest he got for the money he already had. \n\nSuper nice guy and I had no clue at the time how much he had.", "Wife and I were out at Longhorn\u2019s a few months back\u2026we go there regularly and always sit at the bar. We\u2019ve done that for probably 98% of all the meals we hve eaten out in the last almost 50 years\u2026because you meet a better class of bum that way is our standard line. We chatted with the fellow next to us and had our usual cocktail and a glass of wine and dinner so the bill was $100ish\u2026he had left a few minutes before us and paid our bill which we found out w(en we wondered where our check was. We are retired and live in FL\u2026but ain\u2019t broke nd he was close to our age\u2026he had retired from the Air Force and had been stationed in Shemya Island AK where one of my post retirement jobs had a contract so I had visited there as well. We were both nicely dressed so it was either we looked broke (which I doubt) or he just did a nice thing. I\u2019ve paid for a dinner for somebody as well.", "> Did you hear that in the US a GLASS OF WATER is $9 at some places\n\nThat's actually very unusual, especially for the US. We're the least likely to have a fee for a glass of water here.", "That must be a unique situation or place, because literally every single restaurant I've ever gone to has free water. I can't think of a single place that has water that you pay for unless you're asking for some sort of specialty water.\n\nFizzy water is a different animal (and disgusting, in my opinion).", "Water is free in the US if you get tap water. It only costs money if you buy fancy stuff", "In most places in the USA glasses of water are free but bottles of water can be expensive", "Yeah and they don't tell you that either they ask if you want to be started off with still or sparkling so before you have chance to look at the menu you could have spent $24 on a meal fir two. Outrageous. Oh wait the obligatory 30% tip in USA so over $30 before you read the menu. And if you ask for tap water the AI in the wait staff defaults to random phrases apparently.", "No, only a very narrow band of places will charge for water. Most places will have free tap and/or filtered water (pretty sure free tap water is required by law). Places like that usually either won't offer sparkling water or will have a very cheap sparkling water on the beverages menu (often flavored). High end places aren't charging for water because it comes off as cheap. Only places that want to appear fancy but aren't actually fancy will offer sparkling water but charge you for it, and even then I've never seen one charge $9+.", "But the tap water is 'hydrating'.", "Yes, that's correct.\n\nI'm older and unless you have been expressly been given instructions to order anything you want, you take your price point cue from the host's selection.\n\nPersonally, even with the green light to order anything, I don't feel comfortable doing so.\n\nI do think OP holds some responsibility for not making it clear in the beginning that people were responsible for their own bill.   He could have asked if everyone wanted seperate checks or something similar before ordering to make it clear or asked his friend to relay to the add-ons that this was not his treat.\n\nYes, the others were presumptive but since this does happen, he should have taken a simple action to stop it before it happened.", "Yes, ask the host what\u2019s good on the menu, and order in that price range.", "But that assumes that the mid-range item isn't something I'd like or would have ordered anyway.", "Downvoting you purely because how dare you shit on fizzy water?!", "This is just... not true.\n\nI have literally never been seated and not been either immediately given a menu, or apologized to and told menus would be one moment. Second, please tell me where the $24 number comes from. The other BS post on here? The percentage of restaurants that charges $12 per glass for sparkling water I would bet is less than .1% - and it is probably either at a tourist attraction or some fake fancy meme place like a Salt Bae restaurant or something rather than a normal place.\n\nAnd finally, 30% tip? Mandatory gratuity is 18% IF you have a party of 6 or more, less people and you tip what you feel is fair. Most courteous people will tip 20% for good service.\n\nAnd finally, the number of waitstaff who get \"stuck on random phrases\" like the waitress in the other post are wait staff that will lose their job in a matter of days, because most American customers expect to be treated like the owner of the company and a fair percentage will complain. Read any post on askreddit like \"non americans what surprised you the most about america\" and the restaurant ones will be all about how people are super chatty or tipping is weird or portion sizes are huge. None of them will be about $12 water, lol.", "Well, I'm kind of assuming that the cheap thing isn't what you would've ordered anyway.  If you want the mid-range thing, I want you to get the mid range thing.\n\nBut just to point out it's a slightly different idea that what you would've ordered anyway.  I want you to get what you'd get if everything on the menu was free, not what you'd have ordered if you were there on your own dime.", "It makes me gag. It's so gross to me! My husband loves it but it just tastes like... I don't know, what I'd imagine liquified baking soda to taste. I've never understood people who like that taste, but to each their own!\n\nTo make it even more egregious, however... I don't even like carbonation, period. I prefer flat soda. Hahaha.", "lololol liquified baking soda. Ok, now you've got an upvote. \n\nAnd no, i totally get it. It's something people either love or hate! I grew up with it so I think it's like a nostalgia thing for me, but I just love it so much. I drink WAY too much of it. Like my insides are probably going to corrode from the abuse."]}
