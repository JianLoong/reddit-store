We did some research and found that there were only three stores nearby, the closest one was a adult toy store (if you know what I mean) so we and we didn't really want to got there, but after many failed attempts of going to other places, we decided to suck it up and go. I went in and bought it, at that point I was drooling to get it so I paid 70 of my hard earned bucks. I was happy. I wore it for a few months but i took a break from it in winter because nobody could notice anyway due to the extreme layers of clothes i put on. So i put it in my closet and forgot about it for a while. Later one of my friend's let's call them Ray noticed that I wasn't wearing it, they were also experimenting and hadn't bought one due to similar reasons, so they asked if they could buy mine. I wasn't to keen on selling it but I needed some money and this could get me some, I offered to sell it to them for 50 bucks because we were close, but they only wanted to pay 30, I was a little desperate so accepted. It has been almost two years now they havent payed me back and they are always asking me to lend them money, this led me to make a whole checklist of things Ray hasn't payed me back for. It's Halloween soon so I text Ray and ask them if I can take it back and use it for the costume I needed to sew and glue some stuff onto it so borrowing it wasn't an option, they said they still needed it and I told them they still haven't paid me and that it was unfair constantly making excuses to pay me later. They told me that they only now had the money set aside for me I wasn't very happy with the fact they only wanted to pay me when I was asking for it back. I volunteered to bring them to the store, since they are also much smaller than me and I thought they could get a much better fit. but they said they didn't have enough money and that they had spent it all on school supplies so l asked to\n\"borrow\" it and I'm not planning to give it back.", "created_utc": 1667244620, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yim8fz/aita_for_taking_back_something_i_gave_to_a_friend/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Asking to \"borrow\" something you sold without the intention of giving it back is extremely unethical, it's basically a scam.  \nDon't be friends with this person but if they've sent you the 30 then this is their binder that they're kindly lending to you and you can't keep it.  \nDon't be friends with this person if you don't want to, don't lend people money if they already owe you money, don't lend money to friends you aren't prepared to lose.  \nDo not keep the binder. Go buy another one.\nEdit: did Ray send you the money? The lying is bad either way but it's much worse if you have the money. The other comments seem to think you don't but, to me, it reads like Ray finally paid you.\nEdit edit ray didn't pay. OP doesn't think they intend to. Judgment changed to NTA.
