Unfortunate they couldn't attend, but not unusual nor grounds for reschedule.", "NTA. \n\nIt was a dinner to celebrate your sister and her partner's birthdays. It wasn't your place or your girlfriend's place to ask them to change the date In situations like this, it's usually a \"come! We want you there. But if you can't, we understand\". You and your partner aren't what's being celebrated so it's not really your place or hers to ask them to reschedule. If they were hosting something for you or your partner, then yes they need to run it by you, but not this. \n\nMy partner and I miss dinners when our schedules don't align. We just have the partner attending send regrets.", "NTA. It sounds like a pretty big group-I count 8 plus his siblings. It\u2019s probably unrealistic to find a date that works for everyone. Someone was bound to not be able to make it-it just happened to be your GF. She shouldn\u2019t take it personally and she shouldn\u2019t be upset with you for going. I also think it may have been overstepping to ask them to change it. If they had wanted to make sure everyone could make it, they would have asked who could make it and who couldn\u2019t. You did let them know your gf had to work. If they had wanted to change it, they would have done so. It sounds to me that they prioritized having it on their chosen date over making sure everyone could come. This was their right-it was their birthday celebration,", "NTA\n\nThat's adult life sometimes. She needs to grow up.", "Given that you asked about asking your family to accommodate your gf, I\u2019d say NTA. It\u2019s their birthday and their party even if the last minute plan (change?) was rather off putting.", "NTA she can\u2019t request your family change a birthday dinner to accommodate her", "NTA. Getting upset at the date and time someone sets their birthday party has the same energy as kids that get upset that they aren't getting presents at someone else's party. If she couldn't make it, oh well. Mountains don't have to be moved for someone who isn't the birthday couple, especially someone who isn't related to them.", "I think you going without telling her is probably the main reasons she\u2019s angry and the whole not asking to reschedule point is just salt in the wound. \n\nYour family probably aren\u2019t going to reschedule last minute plans for your gf, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to say hey so and so can\u2019t do that day is the date flexible? That said she also would have to accept if it wasn\u2019t possible. \n\nIn all I think you need to communicate better.", "ehh you\u2019re kind of the asshole for not asking. if a different date didnt work then no big deal, but who are you hurting by making the request? she wanted to spend time with your family, i think thats really nice.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You should have gone.\n\nYour GF could not make it on the appointed day and time, so she didn't go. Frankly the idea that the GF would even ask 6+ other people to change their plans to suit her is ridiculous. Never mind that she is a GF not a relative at this time.\n\nIs your GF selfish like this in other ways?
