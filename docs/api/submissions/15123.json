Block him immediately.  \n\nThis is what manipulators and abusers do, to keep us in contact with them.  They keep on finding something to discuss, something to demand, something to falsely accuse us of so we will defend ourselves.   **This is a manipulation tactic called JADE:  justify, argue, defend, explain.**  They throw out some words that make us respond with one of these things.  When they falsely accuse, we try to defend ourselves or justify our choices.  When they demand something ridiculous, like returning gifts, we try to explain or argue that this isn't how normal people do things.  Etc.  But **it's all about them keeping you responding**, not about the actual topic or words. **It's about keeping your attention on them.**  People like this expect that eventually, we will come back to the old relationship with them.  They find topics to discuss that they know will get to us in some way, just to keep us talking with them. \n\nThe way to stop this is to **stop responding.**  It's not rude to not respond to someone who is manipulative like this.  It's protecting yourself.\n\nThis is a person you barely know, already doing this to you.  **Block him, in all ways**.  Cut your social media down to nothing, if you can, for anything he might have a way to see.  Tell people you know well,  in places you often go, to watch out for him, because he's getting creeper vibes now. If you can, find new places to hang out with friends, not the old ones, so he won't know where to find you.
