A few months after his death, my mother married her a guy named \"John\". John already had two teenage boys and he didn't want to raise me because he never wanted to be a girl's father. My mother, like a good mother, abandoned me with my aunt and took my brother (8 by the time) with her to live with her husband. John was a man with a lot of money and he always spoiled my mother and brother, but he never bothered to get me even a Christmas present. My mother didn't do anything for me either, she came to visit me once a month and didn't even call me at Christmas or New Year (I always called, but many times she didn't answer). My aunt was a woman who couldn't have children, because of that she and my uncle raised me as if I were their daughter, not missing anything for me. \n\nEven without much money I accumulated some money from my job I had during high school and I earned a small amount from my aunt which was enough for me to pay for my college. At the time I graduated in computer science and went to work in a good company earning a great salary, but eight years ago I received a much better job offer in a large company (One well known for having great Hardware products). In that time, I accumulated a lot of money and helped my uncle and aunt renovate their house and I always sent them a nice amount even if they told me to spend it on myself. \n\nI currently live alone in a great apartment with an estimated value in the millions. Recently my mom called me on my Instagram (I post a lot of pictures of trips and fancy places I go, it's not too hard to find me). She asked if we could meet to talk and reevaluate our relationship to forget the past and move forward as mother and daughter. I have a soft heart so I took it, I thought it would be an opportunity for us to talk and finally create the bond I always wanted. We made an appointment at a restaurant downtown and met there. \n\nWhen we got there she hugged me, kissed me on the cheek and said she missed me. We talked about my life and when I asked how hers was going, she started to talk about how bad she was. Apparently she divorced John and my brother didn't want to keep her as she is now poor. To make matters worse, she lives on a pension from John and has serious heart problems. After a while she asked if I could pay for a surgery she needed. The surgery was quite expensive, quite a lot. I told her I wouldn't pay as I wouldn't feel good doing that. She yelled at me in the middle of the restaurant, said I was a terrible daughter and that I was letting her die even though I could pay for her surgery. I left there very embarrassed.\n\n\nWhen I told my aunt, she said it was my decision but remarked that I have plenty of money to pay and that it wouldn't affect me financially. I don't want to do this cause she never have been a mom to me, but i need to ask.

I had a mother similar to yours (or maybe I still have her; idk her current status). She abandoned me at 4, had intermittent contact through my childhood, then when I was an adult and earning money, suddenly she\u2019s back wanting to rebuild our relationship (what relationship?). I did \u201clend\u201d her money several times which she never paid back. It was always something\u2026 being evicted, being sick, not having money for food, etc. \n\nThe last time I spoke to her, she was once again being evicted, so I said \u201cok, I\u2019ll give you the money to avoid eviction, but that\u2019s it. After this, the bank of Wambling Wombat is closed\u201d. If you want to speak to me, there can be no further requests for money.\u201d She tried a few more times after that, and she even got other people involved to tell me how cruel I was being to her, but my conscience is clear. \n\nSo, my advice: do what you can to ensure your conscience is clear. Ask yourself whether not giving her money will be something you regret in 5-10 years time. If you think you might regret it, give her the money but make it clear that it\u2019s a one time only offer.

I pay the hospital directly and at no point will be giving cash to her 2. never contact me again.", "NTA- I do agree with another commenter that make sure it is something you can live with.

Offer to donate the amount to a charity for people suffering from her condition in her honor.", "This is easy, NTA. This is something very common on Reddit: parents abandon their children, sometimes for years, and only want back in their life once women (or a kidney) is needed. She's not interested in you, just your money. She showed her true colors when she called you a terrible daughter. That was rich coming from a terrible mother!", "NTA.  If your mom is in the U.S. she may qualify.for indigent care.  But it sounds like your mother only got in touch because she wants something from you. You can't buy her love and she should probably ask John to pay for her surgery if indigent care isn't a possibility.", "No matter what you do, you are NTA. She is 100% TA for abandoning you and you owe her nothing. With that said though, I have a feeling it might bother you if she passes and you knew you could have helped. I definitely think it might have a negative impact on your aunt, she sounds worried about her sister and that she wishes you would help her. If I were in your position and could truly afford the surgery I would go ahead and pay for it, but would be upfront that this is the only thing I will ever help with and will be completely no contact afterwards. I would tell her ( if you feel this way) that she isn\u2019t forgiven and she doesn\u2019t deserve it, but that you are doing this for your own conscience and for your aunt. It would also probably be helpful if you talk to your aunt about all this first and make sure she is on board. Your mother is definitely just using you for money at this point, so I think if you do end up paying for the surgery it will be important you go no contact with her so she can\u2019t guilt you into this again and make it a clear boundary with your aunt that this is the only thing you are willing to pay for regarding your mother. Again though, no matter what choice you make NTA. This is just what I would do personally.", "NTA that is not a mom but an egg donor. You owe her nothing.

No follow up surgeries, no rental help, no future emergencies, nothing. \n\nThat money isn't just to pay for her surgery, but also any sort of (undeserved) guilt you may feel.", "NTA I say be the bigger person since it won\u2019t affect you financially.  Pay for the surgery.  Pay the hospital directly and not for anything else.  Then let her go as you now know that she is only reaching out to you for money.

The question you should ask yourself is, would she have come to you and reconciled if she didn't need your money? She's shouting at you in a restaurant within 1 hour of her \"reconciliation\" with you because you won't give her tens of thousands of dollars? Nonsense. Your mother made her bed.

It really is that simple. It doesn't matter whose womb you came out, nor whose dong sired you, but whether the holder of those parts actually played the part past perfunctory involvement. Your mother abandoned you, and thus can call upon nothing.\n\n>Recently my mom called me on my Instagram\n\nTelling that she had to do this through social media and didn't have any other contact info. Very telling.\n\n>When I told my aunt, she said it was my decision but remarked that I have plenty of money to pay and that it wouldn't affect me financially. I don't want to do this cause she never have been a mom to me, but i need to ask.\n\nYour aunt means well, but your mother doesn't. She only contacted you as a backup because your brother was spoiled by her ex, and her ex isn't in the picture anymore.\n\nThe fact is, *just because you have the money* is not an obligation of morality or whatever to say you owe her anything. As it stands the way she treated you growing up with total indifference means she's entitled to indifference. At that point you may as well chuck money at general charity if you have some kind of a guilty conscience, because it'll amount to the same really.

Nothing unusual or wrong about that. \n\nyou know your mum would never have contacted you if she didn\u2019t need your money?. She is selfish and a disgraceful excuse of a mother", "NTA. But before you make your decision. Ask to speak with her doctor. Meet her surgeon. Make sure you understand everything she would have to go through, success rate. See copies of her medical records. I don\u2019t think your mom has a heart issue. I think she wants money to live more comfortably and knows you are a good person (since she was t the person to raise you).

But OP needs to be sure about the fact that without the money to pay, her \"mother\" wouldn't contact her. She is seeing OP like an ATM. NTA and forget her.", "NTA at all. This happens all the time. I would honestly get a therapist if I were you though and talk it over with them. I can\u2019t emphasize enough how much it is not even remotely your responsibility but nobody on here has to live with this decision. It is an issue very common in the professional athlete community.", "NTA, please don\u2019t feel guilty. Don\u2019t let her get to you to get you to pay. Don\u2019t do it. Keep spending your money on yourself and your real parents, the people that raised you. Good luck with everything.", "Nta. You don\u2019t owe it to her. But unpopular opinion you might owe it to yourself. The fact that you were willing to meet with her shows you have a big heart. You were rightfully angry when you realized she was just using you for money (that\u2019s a fact she was), but sometimes when the anger fades you can be left with regret and guilt, for treating someone the way the treated you.  You could literally save a life. \n\nI know from experience that not going high when they can low can eat at a conscious, and leave a person very bitter. She isn\u2019t entitled  to your money or your time . And you won\u2019t be an a hole if you don\u2019t give it to her. But you know your heart best and if this is something that could haunt you , I say do it for yourself cause you could save a life even if it\u2019s hers and that for as horrible as she was to you she can\u2019t make you act like her.  Again NTA , just don\u2019t want you to have regrets, and being NTA in actuality doesn\u2019t always stop you from feeling like one. \n\nThat said if you do it, give the money to the hospital and pay directly don\u2019t just give it to her cause she sounds like someone who would scam. If you don\u2019t try to remember that it was her actions that led her here.", "NTA\n\nHow do you know that your Mom needs money for an expensive surgery?", "NTA. Your aunt is your real mom at this point. \n\nYour biological mum abandoned you, and is only trying to build a relationship for the sake of your money. Do you think she will continue a relationship with you if you don't give her money, or if you give her some for an operation and then say no more? I don't think so. There's no bond between you, and she is just trying to manipulate you.", "NTA and her reaction shows exactly why you were right not to give her that money.

No ma\u2019am you are nicer than I would\u2019ve been because I would\u2019ve told her maybe she should\u2019ve thought about that before choosing a stranger over her daughter.", "NTA\n\nShe stopped treating you as a daughter long ago. Only came because she needs a new money source now hers has been cut off. \n\nIf you do end up deciding to contribute make sure you only do it directly to the hospital not to her.", "Nta", "NTA at all.  You are more than justified in not paying for it.  However my question to you is this\u2026can you live with it if you don\u2019t?  If the answer is that you can, all well and good.  But if there is a chance that you could regret it one day, do it for you, not for her.  You do not deserve to suffer from this woman twice, once in life and then again in her death.  Best of luck to you.", "NTA.", "NTA. \nDo you live in America?

It\u2019s possible to be TA even when the other person treated you terribly, put your hurt feelings aside, help the person out and move on.", "NTA\n\nI think it's time for mommy to feel what it's like to be abandoned by her family", "NTA your mother is!", "You could keep your money, if it makes you feel better. Or, you could be the bigger person and pay for the surgery, if you can well afford it. Only you can judge how you might feel in 10 years time, whether your Mum is around or not, and whether or not having the surgery might have prolonged her life. It's a tricky one and I can't decide. Good luck with your life.", "NTA. \u201cMom\u201d or not, you don\u2019t owe her a single thing.", "NTA - you dont owe her anything. That said, if the surgery is truly life or death, only can happen with help, and you aren't going to be financially impacted, paying the hospital directly just once is probably easier on your conscience.", ">She asked if we could meet to talk and reevaluate our relationship to forget the past and move forward as mother and daughter. I have a soft heart so I took it, I thought it would be an opportunity for us to talk and finally create the bond I always wanted.\n\nThis right here is the key. You gave her an opportunity but what she did proves that she's only going to you because everyone else in her life has already told her no. If she had done what she said she was going to and actually tried to repair the relationship, then you might have been able to give her a chance. It's clear that your mother is the AH here. She has no right to ask you for help when she left you. Your aunt and uncle are your parents now, so there's no reason for you to feel guilty for not paying. If she really missed you, she would've visited you a lot sooner. \n\n> I don't want to do this cause she never have been a mom to me\n\nListen to yourself. It sounds like you've already decided. Don't let the societal expectation that children need to care for their parents convince you otherwise. She doesn't deserve anything from you.", "So NTA. You don't owe her a thing, but...\n\nWhat if you did pay for the surgery? First research what she needs and what it costs and whether it really helps. Then if you decide it is the gift you want to give, you can say; This I will do for you. You abandon me and never supported me and have only turned to me to save your life. I will save your life, but I will not forget all the things you never did for me. Tell her that you don't really want her in your life because you saw how she really is at the restaurant. She only pretended to care for you until she realized you were not going to pay for her surgery at the point you were then discussing it. But you have been trying to show compassion even where it may not be deserved. So this is you one and only gift.", "NTA how could you be a terrible daughter to her when she was never your mother? \n\nShe\u2019s made her bed, kicking you out of it when you were five, and now she can lie on the lumpy cold mattress of her own egotistical decisions and Deal with them. \n\nYou owe her Nothing.", "YTA.

Absolutely NTA.", "This exactly, she wants something and it\u2019s not a relationship. The first husband was her ATM, which was worth more than her child, now her ATM is gone, she taught her son to be the same money grubber that she is, and he kicked her to the curb now that she\u2019s on a fixed income. Now OP is nothing g more than the next ATM. \nMom needs to get a job, health insurance and figure out life for herself.", "I thought the same thing.

You are no more obligated to give her anything than you are any other random acquaintance, stranger, or betrayer.  That piece of work who gave birth to you, on the other hand, is quite the AH.
