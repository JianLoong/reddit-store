A few months after his death, my mother married her a guy named \"John\". John already had two teenage boys and he didn't want to raise me because he never wanted to be a girl's father. My mother, like a good mother, abandoned me with my aunt and took my brother (8 by the time) with her to live with her husband. John was a man with a lot of money and he always spoiled my mother and brother, but he never bothered to get me even a Christmas present. My mother didn't do anything for me either, she came to visit me once a month and didn't even call me at Christmas or New Year (I always called, but many times she didn't answer). My aunt was a woman who couldn't have children, because of that she and my uncle raised me as if I were their daughter, not missing anything for me. \n\nEven without much money I accumulated some money from my job I had during high school and I earned a small amount from my aunt which was enough for me to pay for my college. At the time I graduated in computer science and went to work in a good company earning a great salary, but eight years ago I received a much better job offer in a large company (One well known for having great Hardware products). In that time, I accumulated a lot of money and helped my uncle and aunt renovate their house and I always sent them a nice amount even if they told me to spend it on myself. \n\nI currently live alone in a great apartment with an estimated value in the millions. Recently my mom called me on my Instagram (I post a lot of pictures of trips and fancy places I go, it's not too hard to find me). She asked if we could meet to talk and reevaluate our relationship to forget the past and move forward as mother and daughter. I have a soft heart so I took it, I thought it would be an opportunity for us to talk and finally create the bond I always wanted. We made an appointment at a restaurant downtown and met there. \n\nWhen we got there she hugged me, kissed me on the cheek and said she missed me. We talked about my life and when I asked how hers was going, she started to talk about how bad she was. Apparently she divorced John and my brother didn't want to keep her as she is now poor. To make matters worse, she lives on a pension from John and has serious heart problems. After a while she asked if I could pay for a surgery she needed. The surgery was quite expensive, quite a lot. I told her I wouldn't pay as I wouldn't feel good doing that. She yelled at me in the middle of the restaurant, said I was a terrible daughter and that I was letting her die even though I could pay for her surgery. I left there very embarrassed.\n\n\nWhen I told my aunt, she said it was my decision but remarked that I have plenty of money to pay and that it wouldn't affect me financially. I don't want to do this cause she never have been a mom to me, but i need to ask.

I had a mother similar to yours (or maybe I still have her; idk her current status). She abandoned me at 4, had intermittent contact through my childhood, then when I was an adult and earning money, suddenly she\u2019s back wanting to rebuild our relationship (what relationship?). I did \u201clend\u201d her money several times which she never paid back. It was always something\u2026 being evicted, being sick, not having money for food, etc. \n\nThe last time I spoke to her, she was once again being evicted, so I said \u201cok, I\u2019ll give you the money to avoid eviction, but that\u2019s it. After this, the bank of Wambling Wombat is closed\u201d. If you want to speak to me, there can be no further requests for money.\u201d She tried a few more times after that, and she even got other people involved to tell me how cruel I was being to her, but my conscience is clear. \n\nSo, my advice: do what you can to ensure your conscience is clear. Ask yourself whether not giving her money will be something you regret in 5-10 years time. If you think you might regret it, give her the money but make it clear that it\u2019s a one time only offer.

I pay the hospital directly and at no point will be giving cash to her 2. never contact me again.", "NTA- I do agree with another commenter that make sure it is something you can live with.

Offer to donate the amount to a charity for people suffering from her condition in her honor.", "This is easy, NTA. This is something very common on Reddit: parents abandon their children, sometimes for years, and only want back in their life once women (or a kidney) is needed. She's not interested in you, just your money. She showed her true colors when she called you a terrible daughter. That was rich coming from a terrible mother!", "NTA.  If your mom is in the U.S. she may qualify.for indigent care.  But it sounds like your mother only got in touch because she wants something from you. You can't buy her love and she should probably ask John to pay for her surgery if indigent care isn't a possibility.", "No matter what you do, you are NTA. She is 100% TA for abandoning you and you owe her nothing. With that said though, I have a feeling it might bother you if she passes and you knew you could have helped. I definitely think it might have a negative impact on your aunt, she sounds worried about her sister and that she wishes you would help her. If I were in your position and could truly afford the surgery I would go ahead and pay for it, but would be upfront that this is the only thing I will ever help with and will be completely no contact afterwards. I would tell her ( if you feel this way) that she isn\u2019t forgiven and she doesn\u2019t deserve it, but that you are doing this for your own conscience and for your aunt. It would also probably be helpful if you talk to your aunt about all this first and make sure she is on board. Your mother is definitely just using you for money at this point, so I think if you do end up paying for the surgery it will be important you go no contact with her so she can\u2019t guilt you into this again and make it a clear boundary with your aunt that this is the only thing you are willing to pay for regarding your mother. Again though, no matter what choice you make NTA. This is just what I would do personally.", "NTA that is not a mom but an egg donor. You owe her nothing.

No follow up surgeries, no rental help, no future emergencies, nothing. \n\nThat money isn't just to pay for her surgery, but also any sort of (undeserved) guilt you may feel.", "NTA I say be the bigger person since it won\u2019t affect you financially.  Pay for the surgery.  Pay the hospital directly and not for anything else.  Then let her go as you now know that she is only reaching out to you for money.

Although she was distant she made sure you were not dead, hurt, or abused in any way. She could have easily dropped you into the foster care system, but she didn't. I'll agree that she was an AH for not calling or visiting on Christmas or New Year's but she did visit and ensure that you were safe at the end of the day.

Don\u2019t give in and let her reap the consequences of her actions. It doesn\u2019t matter if you can afford it, but if you do it even once then she will do it and keep squeezing until you have nothing left and she will just drop you again. Also I don\u2019t know what your relationship is with your brother but don\u2019t do anything for him either-if he left your mum because John has money and she doesn\u2019t, he\u2019s also likely to just want to use you too (just a guess).", "NTA.\n\nAre you an asshole?\n\nNo.\n\nWill you regret it if she dies?\n\nYes.  It will definitely fuck you up for a while.\n\nFor perspective, I was in a long term relationship with a woman who was flat out abused as a child.  Her mother had children via two different fathers.  My ex's father was never there for her. She didn't meet the man until she was in high school when it turns out that he was also the father of her best friend.  \n\nHer mother was bipolar.  She was educated enough to be well read but also ratchet enough to work at a meat cutting plant and beat her kids with electrical cords to the point that my ex had permanent scars across her back.  This woman fell into a neverending carousel of bad relationships and drug / alcohol problems.  She even prevented my ex from leaving the state to attend a university on full scholarship.  Her sister's biological father sexually assaulted her as a child.\n\nAnyway, my ex despised this woman.  Her personal issues aside, her mother was a real piece of work.  She used racially disparaging words for her grandchildren, who were mixed-race (she was black, she didn't like that her grandbaby had a light complexion).  \n\nThen the call came in.  Her mother died in a car accident.  Apparently both the driver of the car she was in AND the driver of the other car had been drinking.\n\nMy ex was beside herself in grief.  For missed opportunities.  For not trying hard enough to reconcile. She always thought she'd have more time, and even if it didn't, that it wouldn't affect her. But people with good hearts suffer from regret because they're good people. Hell, my ex ended up doing me wrong in the end in a way that I am still trying to get over (and mostly failing), but I still believe that she's fundamentally a good person who is just doing what she thinks is best for her kids.\n\nSo, I'll offer this bit of advice: if you are well-off enough that paying for her surgery (provided that her condition is life-threatening and legitimate... and I mean ONLY the surgery.... she doesn't deserve a dime for anything else) won't affect your ability to lead the life you wish to live, then consider paying for it. Not because you owe this woman anything, but because you owe it to yourself to free yourself from the potential burden of guilt that you don't deserve. Your mother is either incapable or unwilling to bear the burden of her indifference toward you, but you might feel yourself crushed under the weight of guilt you don't deserve should she die from her condition.  \n\nChoose to be free.", "NTA\n\nI understand that you have a soft heart, but you can't let people take advantage of it.\n\nShe abandoned you for her own personal gain.
