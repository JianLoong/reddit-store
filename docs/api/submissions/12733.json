I let him move into one of my rental properties and we did it all legal. Lease agreement and everything. \n\nBecause I was renting to him at a breakeven point we agreed that he was responsible for all the maintenance of the house and yard.  \n\nWell he has four kids. And the hot water tank isn't enough for his family and he wants a new one. I told him to go ahead. He then proceeded to take the cost of the hot water tank and installation of of that month's rent. I reminded him of our agreement. He said he wasn't making improvements to my property for free. I said that the old hot water tank was fine and he made the decision to replace it. Big argument and I didn't want to fight so I said that he was not allowed to make any further changes to the house without my explicit agreement. \n\nSo he stopped doing maintenance as a protest. \n\nThe house itself is not pretty but it is solid. It is old and the wiring in it was not meant for all the modern electronics we have. \n\nHe wanted to add a new breaker box and run more outlets. I said no thanks. I cannot afford that since I'm not making any money on the house. He started getting bitchy about it and the rent started getting paid late. \n\nI tried talking to him but he said that he had to buy some stuff for the house and he was low on cash. \n\nSo I sold the house. While the house itself isn't great it is in an older part of the city and the property itself is a quarter of an acre. Every time a house sells in the neighborhood it is snapped up by developers and tuned into multi family units. Or one guy built a McMansion on his land. \n\nI know a lot of the developers and I didn't even need to list the house to have it sold in less than a week. \n\nMy brother found out when he was served with an eviction notice. He called me to ask WTF. So I told him that the house was causing me headaches and I had an opportunity to make some money and I took it. He said I should have offered him a chance to buy it. I said that he was having trouble making rent. How was he going to qualify for a mortgage. He said I'm an asshole and that he has the money he was waiting to make me an offer.  I asked him if he had money why he was late on his rent. \n\nHe started bad-mouthing me to all our family. A few of them took his side and tried to say I was being an asshole so I offered all of them a chance to clear his debt to me if they wanted to share their opinion. None of them took me up on the offer. \n\nMy parents are on my side and they said I shouldn't have rented to him in the first place. \n\nI feel bad for my sister-in-law and the kids but I'm not going to spend the rest of my life subsidizing his.", "created_utc": 1679306482, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11weiux/aita_for_selling_the_house_my_brother_and_his/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Getting out of any form of monetary dealings with him was the absolute smartest thing you could have done. Good on you for not giving him first dibs after he decided he was going to be a crappy tenant when you refused to play any more of his dumb games after the hot water heater incident.

So glad to see that wasn't the case here. This is a great opportunity for your brother to learn that his actions actually do have consequences out in the real world (not holding my breath by any means.. but the opportunity for him to learn is there, minimally), and hopefully you have learned on your side to avoid dealings like this with family/friends in the future.\n\nSorry you had to go through it, but hopefully you can rest assured in that you handled it as best as a crappy situation like this can be handled (in my opinion).", "NTA...but your parents are right.

You were very generous with your brother who kept taking from you - the only way the water tank thing makes sense is if he believed that you weren\u2019t doing him a favor - that every landlord rents at break even rates to family and family still gets the full tenant benefits package. \n\nThings escalated, and you wanted out of the deal (and the house). That made sense. \n\nWhen you made the decision to sell, you should have let him know, both to allow him to purchase it (maybe he could have swung the loan), and to give him the largest window possible for moving. Unless you feel there was a risk he\u2019d damage the property to sabotage the sale, that\u2019s something you should have done. \n\nNow, are you an AH for not doing it?\n\nYour inference that he didn\u2019t have the ability to buy the house is presumptuous, but pretty reasonable. I\u2019ll give you a pass on that - I\u2019d have assumed the same. \n\nSo now it\u2019s down to \u201cwere you an AH did not giving him more warning?\u201d  I can give you a pass before the sale.

Legally, you are obligated to tell a renter that (at least in the two states I've rented in)", "INFO: what was the \u201cbreak even\u201d rent.\nAlso, how old were the electronics and water heater?

I don't think anyone wants to put money in to a property they don't own. YTA for making that agreement.\n\nIt doesn't seem like the improvement's your brother was suggesting were necessary, but in some places, the tenant does have the right to withhold rent if the house isn't being properly maintained by the landlord. If you were so worried about the money to make this improvements to the hot water heater and wiring, you should have just told him he should pay more in rent. Serving them an eviction notice without even discussing possible solutions is such an AH move.", "YTA for not giving a renter a chance to purchase and selling it without notice (might be illegal in your state).

He was also being kind of a dick, but yeah, you're absolutely an asshole.", "ESH\n\nThe reason you didn't warn your brother is out of spite, that makes you an asshole. His requests and attitude were unreasonable, which makes him an asshole.", "He was a bad tenant and took advantage of you. You did the right thing, he would have continued to use you. NTA. If you told him, he would have tried to guilt you into giving to him for way below market value or tried to talk you out of it.", "You're NTA. He was taking advantage of you, now he's playing the victim. Typical behavior of someone who doesn't take responsibility for his own actions.", "I wish he hadn't tried to play silly buggers.

No profit.", "Why would I serve him an eviction notice on a house I do not own?", "1. The hot water heater and electrical wiring are fine. Just not top of the line like he wanted. \n\n2.

I still think you are the AH for expecting him to maintain your property.

In the long run, you are the one benefiting from this arrangement.\n\nYou might not have personally evicted him, but you sold the house and knew this would happen.

There must have been some other options you could have explored.", "Often mortgages can be less than renting.", "Still NTA. How many chances does someone need.

They both benefited until the brother blew that up", "The brother would have been paying for the maintenance either way, either out of pocket as the issues arose, or by paying regular rent, which would be *more than* enough to cover any maintenance required.", "Trouble making rent means no down payment.", "So?", "Usually I would agree with you. In these situations Im usually like \"you made an agreement and they didn't hold up their end of the bargain\", but I really feel like OP made this deal in bad faith. OP made it seem like he was giving him a break by giving him cheap rent, but maintaining a house can be really expensive. If that water heater crapped out, and actually needed to be replaced, that would be way to much money to expect a tenant to pay. And then when the landlord decides to sell the house behind your back you lose out on your investment.", "You don't know that. the cost of house maintenance is variable. They could have ended up paying way more in repairs than they would have and they would lose out on this investment as soon as they move out. I think this is a stupid deal for any responsible landlord to make.", "Let him handle that with the bank.", "The water heater he replaced was three years old.", "Also the rent he was paying was roughly 60% of the market rate.", "So I should have continued to let him steal from me?", "That really doesnt answer my hypothetical. If the water heater failed and NEEDED to be replaced, would you expect him to pay for it?", "No, give him a chance to go to a bank to see if he can put together a mortgage to make an offer.", "No. But it was still under warranty."]}
