So, even if it wasn\u2019t your brother, you\u2019ve kicked the family out of their home so that some developers can make more profit, which is shitty\n\nAlso, let's be clear, I assume by renting \"break even\" you mean he paid your mortgage and taxes, etc. This is not \"break even\" because you still have the equity in the house. His rent was buying your house. Unfortunately, we live in a market in which having someone else buy your house for you is considered generous if you don't charge extra money to make an immediate profit.

There really is no evidence of that style of behaviour. And therefore I think he deserved to be told by his brother that it had been sold or that he was planning on selling. \n\nIf he wanted this to be a legal agreement and legally handled from the jump(like proposed by the tenancy contract) then he should\u2019ve been upholding the landlord part of the bargain and paying for all of the repairs and issues his brother brought to his attention.

In which case, he is still acting like a bit of an AH, while still being legally correct.", "I agree with you, except about the water heater, because the reality is the water heater stays with the house.

So brother was still paying a mortgage every month, but not going in the house as a result of that.

Through all of this niece and boyfriend were trying to be understanding. Employment issues, marriage issues and a divorce, health issues, etc became frequent excuses and my niece did not want to put her sister, grandma, and niblings out, but they could not afford their rent and the mortgage for this other house + repairs.

Sounds fishy to me.. \n\nA house with bad electrical, inadequate hot water, that is \u201cnot pretty\u201d doesn\u2019t sound like a great place to live.

How much you want to bet that if he had sold to brother for a low-ball price, brother would\u2019ve turned around and sold it to developers for a huge profit and not shared with OP.\n\nNEVER DO BUSINESS WITH FAMILY", "OP would rather sell the property out from under his own brother than have a conversation with him about it.", "I've always heard that business and Family/Friends don't mix. Renting is a business.", "We could not get our house to sell when the military moved us. I didn't not want to be a landlord but we couldn't afford rent and a mortgage. We hired a local company and they handled everything professionally and legally. When we moved back we bought a bigger house since they were still living in the one we owned, we decided at the end of their lease we were going to sell since the market was finally doing well and because we didn't want the uncertainty of someone was going to pay or not. They had 2 months of notice and asked if they could stay til after the holidays and such and we agreed.  We also gave them first dibs to buy. This all went through a company who understands the legal side so we didn't have to struggle. I would never sell or rent to family without a 3rd party and legal paperwork. I don't care if I have to pay fees, it was 100% worth it.", "You're not really being honest here at all. \n\nHe didn't pay you rent on time because he was withholding it on purpose, because he paid for a new waterheater and the house needed wiring amd more outlets...You said that yourself.", "You could afford a rental property but not afford the basic upgrades it needs? You sound insufferable.", "You can\u2019t have been a landlord for very long if you don\u2019t know it\u2019s perfectly legal for tenants to withhold rent when landlords fail their duty to provide a LIVABLE property - like making sure the water heater works and the electric is up to code instead of that \u201cgrandfathered in\u201d crap. Utility systems are above and beyond any customary and usual terms for maintenance. Even if he agreed to provide the labor, YOU as owner still have to pay for parts and supplies.", "There was a lease agreement that spelled out what the tenancy consisted of. Zero risk of a squatters rights claim. Doubly so since you typically need decades of adverse residency before you can successfully claim those rights.", "People like that don't learn lessons. That's why they are the way they are.", "Nope.  Brother did not learn \u201ca valuable lesson\u201d at all.  He simply feels validated and vindicated that the world is indeed out to get him.  People like him are professional victims.", "Well, it may not be enough time to find a *great* place, but it\u2019s definitely enough time to find a place. I\u2019ve done it multiple times now in 1-2 weeks. Not only that, but there\u2019s always friends, family, if all else fails, long term Air bb for a month or two or even a shelter. There\u2019s 100% options. There just might not be options where you get to be extremely picky, but that is a direct consequence of \u201cdon\u2019t look a gift horse in the mouth\u201d.", "I love all of this :)", "That\u2019s what\u2019s bugging me about this whole thing, and I\u2019m shocked by all the people totally siding with OP. Brother was a bad tenant for sure, but OP did literally everything wrong from the landlord side\u2014 at least if we\u2019re talking in a legal and moral sense. They both suck.", "After the LOVELY way his Brother has been acting for months?  IDK, avoiding the drama seems legitimate.", "He should be in a pond because he was being a silly goose.", "I agree bro would have vandalized place or muck up the sale", "OP helped his brother... with \"leftovers\". By his own account, the house needed several improvements. The water tank situation... How on earth is the tenant supposed to pay for that renovation? And yes, the old one was fine... To him, because he wasn't living there. Then the electric wiring. It's not a matter of \"oh there's not enough electrical outlets\". If the house was as old as he says, he should be glad nobody got electrocuted there. And on top of that he EXPECTED his brother to keep up with the house's mantainence. Like, Jesus. The brother is definitely an asshole. But OP is not far behind", "Bro that just unlocked a memory buried very deep in my subconscious \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "If he's under a lease, he'd have until the end of it to vacate. He just received notice he'd have to leave at the end of it as the rental was no longer available to him.", "Something, something... found out.", "The first part of this would be a notice to vacate. If you refuse to comply, that can turn into an actual eviction. Since OP sold the house, the notice to vacate would be from the hew owner.\n\nEvictions are court orders and are searchable. You can search local court records for evictions. Plus, there are services that will do that for you.", "This is why I don\u2019t mix family and finances.\n\nI never \u201c lend\u201d more than I can spare . With my family I know there\u2019s a small chance that I won\u2019t get rightfully paid back . It\u2019s better for our relationship if I only do \u201cgifts\u201c instead of  \u201cloans\u201c . Sometimes that means I have to say \u201cno\u201d but that\u2019s honestly better than building resentment and getting bitter over it. Same with freinds. I\u2019m happy to offer help but i have boundaries around it.", "NTA, beware of the ESH and YTA, some people will simply give those judgements just because you are a land lord. And well look at the mental gymnastics they are pulling here in the comments", "I agree but I believe YTA for not even telling him before hand. Regardless of how he took advantage of you he IS your brother and had a wife and kids. You could have at least told him before selling.\n\nN T A for selling it though. When you told him, it would have just been a notification not a request. Should still have been done as you\u2019ve now not given him a lot of time to figure his future plans out and put his kids in a potentially horrible position.", "You make it sound like people are owed and entitled...his brother made these choices that led to this by being an AH and not paying on time..he has nobody but himself to blame. No other landlord would give him that much slack, just because you're family doesn't mean you have to put up with somebody's shit. Those days are over", "I'm sure he had to legally have him served to vacate the house.", "and in some states a tenant can withhold rent if they have to replace stuff that's supposed to be the landlord's responsibility, so depending on location this could be an illegal eviction", "It does, though to be fair, the tenant wanted to *upgrade* the water heater, not repair it. \n\nI am iffy on the electrical, because if it was safe and worked, then there was no need to replace the panel, but I also don't know how old we are talking. Some old electrical is unsafe, period, in which case the landlord should have replaced it. And should have included some small amount in the rental rate to start building a repair fund. \n\nOverall, they are both TA and neither one knows anything about landlord/tenancy.", "If he did this to a regular landlord he would have gotten evicted so the same rules apply. He just thought he could take the piss because FamIlY", ">I wouldn't be shocked if he tried to do something to prevent the house from being sold\n\nLike performing a \"repair\" and then filling a lien on the property when OP refuses to pay for it.", "I kid you not... I had the same thing happen to me.\n\nI let one of my exes daughters (and her SO of 8 years) move in for a very low rent. I was paying 2/3 of the mortgage, and the rent covered the other third. It was only meant to be for a few months. She stayed 7 years. He died after 3. Then she met someone else and had a couple of kids. It was just never a convenient time for them to move out (though I did have to raise the rent to about 90% of the mortgage payment).\n\nThey were not great tenants, paid late and told stories about why... and they left $25k in damage when I finally had to ask them to leave and said *I'm* an asshole and that they have the money to buy a house. Considering they rent was always paid in bits and pieces, I was skeptical, but told them I was really happy for them buying a house but confused about why they were upset about having to move if that was the case.\n\nAnd in all honesty, unless they had enough for a downpayment AND $25K in repairs, this was not a house they wanted to buy.\n\nNTA", "Good point! He would have expected the house for a steal \ud83d\ude44 entitled. NTA", "I suspect the money he was willing to pay for the house vs the money the po got are vastly different amounts. And he would have haggled to get the price down stating it was older, needed new wiring and whatever else.", "Believe me, he was anticipating \"the family discount.\"\n\nHe was going to moan about any sale price that OP set, and complain to the family about how he was being gouged.", "Waiting for what lol,  the stars to align?", "They disagree with something, so it *must* be American.", "This is a different type of eviction than a tenants failure to pay. This would most likely be a notice that the property has been sold & that they have 30 days to leave.", "Eviction due to late payment is VERY different than eviction due to property being sold, I believe. In that way OP did him YET ANOTHER favor, really.", "...or made an offer. What was he waiting for?", "I agree. It would not be an eviction at this point unless OP left out some things.", "It doesn\u2019t matter. I speak as someone who has been evicted. The only thing that matters and that rental companies see is an eviction notice.", "The \"record\" is the private landlord/developer blacklist.", "No it wouldn\u2019t.  OP isn\u2019t reporting to credit agencies every month.  Only companies (like credit cards ) report monthly and your credit is only dinged when you\u2019re late 30 days or more.  I\u2019ve seen thousands of credit report.  Never have I send eviction notices nor late rental payments.  Now, if a lender requested a Verification of Rent, that might be trickier.", "I forgot to add that the eviction process is very long and it could take anywhere from 6 months to 1 year to get the renter out. In the meantime, OPs brother could just stop paying rent at all. If he really has enough cash to buy the house, she could put a lien on the account to recover her money. I suspect brother is lying about that. In which case, OP would be out for all back rent he owed her.", "> I am not in the United States but I see that term in this sub all the time. It appears there\u2019s some kind of record that follows tenants around, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s credit score or something else. Whenever they\u2019re asked to move it makes a black mark on whatever record it is. It also sounds like they have to go to court every time a landlord wants them to move.\n> \n\nYou're misinformed. There is no such secret ledger of a tenant's bad deeds that follows them. There's only the credit history. And no, there is no need to go to courts every time a landlord wants a tenant to move.\n\n> In my country the landlord has to follow the tenancy legislation and get the appropriate paperwork and give the right amount of notice. No court involved and no record of it unless the next potential landlord calls the landlord who evicted them\n\nThat's how it works in the US as well. What reallly ends up happening is that you only see the really bad cases being posted on reddit and in social media and in the news. And that makes you think the US works differently while the truth is that people are the same everywhere."]}
