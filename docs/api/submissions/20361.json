I never had interest in Kenzie romantically and she was fully aware of that but after 3 times, she started talking about loving me. So I called things off and told my now wife everything (we were still living together-sleeping in the same bed). It took awhile but she forgave me. I would NEVER do that again.

Calling me from blocked numbers, texting my now wife, asking to stay at my place (with my now wife) and saying she needed me. She's been blocked for years. \n\nWell, I stopped going to my buddies house after this all happened. Kenzie ended up moving out but I still didn't go there. He came to my place instead. However, he threw a party the other night and invited me and my wife. My wife wasn't feeling well and decided not to go but told me to go have fun and she would pick me up later (I was going to be drinking). Maybe about an hour in, I'm pretty drunk and out of no where Kenzie is hugging me and trying to engage in conversation. Saying how much she missed me, etc. It took me a minute but I eventually said \"I'm sorry but I really have no desire to talk to you and my wife hates you so please leave me alone\" and she did. She walked off, pissed. So I truly didn't see it as a big deal. Crisis diverted, is what I thought.\n\nNow, I didn't tell my wife she was here but I did ask her if she was feeling well enough to join me a few times. I just didn't want to tell her over text or call. I wanted her with me because I really didn't want to leave. After her saying no a few times, I just asked her to come get me (a couple hours later). When she showed up, she immediately saw Kenzie. I guess she was standing near me somewhere and I didn't notice her. She was silent the whole night.

But, you slept with Kenzie while you and your wife were on a break, and she didn't want to let go. She continued to pursue you and to contact your wife. That's a horse of a different color. Your wife is right, you should have left or looped her in right away. Random ex, no biggie, everyone needs to grow up and move on, but the \"on a break\" ex and her behavior afterward is a no-go zone.", "YTA.  You should have let your wife know she was there when you texted her asking her to join you.", "Sorry bud, YTA,\n\nNot necessarily for not leaving, but given your history with this person, you should have told your wife she was there. Especially since Kenzie is throwing up serious stalker vibes according to your post. Luckily, she can't lie and say you did anything because there's witnesses, but I'm sure it hurts your wife that you didn't tell her.\n\nApologize and try your best to understand everything from her perspective.\n\nGood luck.", "Yep\u2026..YTA.  \n\nKenzie is lava.  If she\u2019s there, you run.  You let your wife know right away. \u201cShe\u2019s here, come get me.\u201d\n\nI know you think it\u2019s over and all in the past..but it\u2019s not. \n\nApologize to your wife, let her \u2018own what you will do next time, and offer to talk about it in detail.  \n\nWhew.", "YTA\n\nThis isn't an ordinary ex of 6.5 years. This is a stalker ex that your wife has a problem with. \n\nYou lied (partially) by omission.   \nAnd I hope you aren't trying the whole \"I barely noticed Kenzie blah blah blah\" line with your wife, that's just insulting.", "YTA. You broke her trust with this person, you don\u2019t get the benefit of the doubt anymore. Should have told your wife asap", "YTA for not letting your wife who you know doesn\u2019t like kenzie know that she was there. you could have talked about it with her and decided whether it\u2019d be okay to stay or best to leave. i don\u2019t get the logic of \u2018didn\u2019t want to tell her over text or call\u2019. misunderstanding that could have been easily avoided imo.", "YTA. You _knew_ your wife would have an issue with this one person. ONE PERSON. You owed it to her to be transparent and have a discussion about options. Instead, you put yourself in a compromising situation (psychos never cease to amaze) for selfish reasons and disrespected your wife.", "YTA because you didn't tell her the full situation that Kenzie was there. It obviously blindsided her when she saw her", "INFO: For clarification, you\u2019ve been married 7 years and you split up during the first 6 months of the marriage? Is that the timeline? \n\nSo, basically this happened 6.5 years ago and Kenzie is still hanging out with your buddy and still obsessed with you even though you only hooked up 3 times?\n\nIDK, man. A lot of this sounds incomplete.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019re cool but nobody is that good in the sack.", "Sorry, but your wife is right and YTA. I have a lump in my stomach because that woman was stalking you, no wonder your wife has such a visceral reaction to her. Seeing her brought back a lot of dark memories, not all of them having to do with you two shagging.\n\n\"Come get me, Kenzie's here\" should have been your immediate message. I hope seeing you doesn't rekindle her stalker behavior.", "Wow you showed no respect to your wife  by giving her a heads up that   Kenzies was there.  But also you go to the effort to name kenzies you don\u2019t your wife\n\nYTA for purposely letting you wife walk into that", "I think you should have told your wife why you wanted her there. I get that it isn't a great phone or text conversation, but she needed to know because you've broken her trust before. Forgiveness and accepting someone back don't mean blindness. Kenzie is the biggest ahole for refusing to leave you alone. But I think you are a bit of one too for not either being straightforward or choosing to leave, even is the party was fun. Is there any party worth losing your relationship.", "YTA. \n\nThe first time you didn't tell her because you wanted both the sex with Kenzie and to continue having unprotected sex with your now-wife and knew that being completely honest would put a stop to one of those things. \n\nThis time you didn't tell her because you \"really didn't want to leave\" and knew she might ask you to if you told her. \n\nThat means BOTH times you've betrayed her have involved Kenzie and BOTH times were because you cared more about your own fun than your wife's feelings and right to total honesty.", "Major YTA\n\nyou admit to breaching the trust in the relationship with this person and then act pissy that your wife doesn't want you around them? \"Kenzie\" comes near you, you walk away. She speaks to you, you walk away. \nYour wife gave you a second chance, not the other way around. Show her even a crumb of respect. Get a grip.", "YTA. Good luck gaining her trust back... AGAIN.", "NTA - Sounds like you handled it fine. Kenzie is the AH, and it sounds like your wife is jealous. You don't have to leave a party because someone you slept with six years ago is there.", "NAH (except for Kenzie)\n\nFirst of all, you didn\u2019t cheat on your wife six years ago so nothing to feel guilty about there. Second, you responded appropriately to a Kenzie\u2019s advances at the party. Your wife has every right to be wary of this woman, and yes it would have been better if you had told her, but unfortunately alcohol does impair our judgement so you get a pass there.\n\nNext time, communicate with the wife and manage the situation together.", "NAH\n\nYou handled the situation as you saw fit, and as far as you were concerned effectively.  However, from your wife's point of view, Kenzie has been a point of contention for years and instead of leaving as soon as you realized she was there you hung out and continued drinking for several hours before calling for a ride home.  AND you texted your wife during that time without ever telling her Kenzie was there.  She's understandably upset because it looks like you chose to disrespect your wife.  You're understandably confused because you basically told Kenzie to f\\*\\*\\* off the second you saw her and repeatedly asked your wife to join you before realizing that wouldn't happen and leaving.\n\nI think you need to apologize to your wife for not communicating the situation to her in real time and not handling it the way she expected you to.  Explain that you thought you handled it effectively since she didn't talk to you after the first time and you just wanted to spend some time with your friend, but that you realize that wasn't the right decision.  Then the two of you can come to an agreement on how any future incidences will be handled by both of you, whether it's just you, just your wife, or both of you together who encounter Kenzie somewhere.  Putting together this game plan as a couple will give both of you the security of knowing that neither of you want this woman in your lives and that clear expectations have been set so that you won't have any of these misunderstandings going forward.", "NTA.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

One of those small town hook up situations with a girl I've known since elementary, who had all the same mutual friends, who never left her home town and clings to every man who shows her attention and wants everyone to be a step-daddy to her kids type of situations. She basically stays inside the same dating pool, on rotation. So I don't even think she's really \"obsessed\" with me but merely bored with the rest of the guys in the area.", "Normally I'd agree, but Kenzie's behavior in the aftermath of OP cutting it off makes her a bit of a wild card. Once someone shows themselves as a threat to my relationship, they're nothing more than a snake whose head needs to be (metaphorically) chopped off. They no longer get to slither around my life, even the periphery.", "It's not a jealousy issue with my wife. It's a lack of respect issue. The messages Kenzie sent her were ridiculous. Talking about how my wife would never compare to her, how she wasn't good enough, etc. So no, not jealousy at all. She has nothing to be jealous of honestly.", "I didn't cheat on my wife. We broke up (we weren't married yet) but we were still living together. I absolutely fucked up but I did not cheat on my wife.", "Why does your friend want her around?", "Stop putting down this woman and realize that you\u2019re the problem in this situation. You cheated on your wife (saw your comment that you were broken up and it wasn\u2019t cheating. Dude you were living with her and still sleeping in the same bed. If it wasn\u2019t cheating, why would your wife have to forgive you. You admit you screwed up). Don\u2019t blame the woman or put her down as a person. You\u2019re the one with the poor morals here. You broke your wife\u2019s trust in you 6.5 years ago and you did is again during this party", "Kenzie isn't a hypnotist. Nor is she violent. So she's not a threat to the relationship, because OP has free will, which he used to tell her to leave him alone.", "Reading it again, it was bad of you to ask your wife to come to the party without telling her Kenzie was there. That's worth apologizing for. But there's no reason you should have had to leave.", "If you were broken up, I don\u2019t understand why she needed to forgive you for hooking up with someone else. That\u2019s why I thought that.", "Not to push the mark, but when you share a bed with a woman, there's still a connection. You may have been separated, but on a subconscious level, you two knew you were getting back together. That's may be why it feels like to her that you cheated. Otherwise, she wouldn't have to forgive you sleeping with another woman.", "Your guess is as good as mine on that one. Cause back when everything happened between Kenzie and I.. the whole reason anything happened that night was because she told me she didn't feel safe staying the night alone with my buddy because he was trying to get in her pants. She asked me to stay and \"protect\" her. Weird manipulation tactic but it worked, cause I believed her \nin my drunken stupor and stayed and that's how it all started. Took her no time at all. I told him exactly what happened that night and he kicked her out not even a week later. I had no idea they were hanging out again. She wasn't mentioned once. She was the last person I expected to see.", "One point to talk about here is the ownership of the bed. If it was his house then why would he sleep somewhere else? We need more info on this op!", "With all due respect, I didn't start putting this woman down until she pulled what she did after I called things off. I made the choice to sleep with her and to put it bluntly, I had wanted to for years. She was my childhood/teenage crush.

So it wasn't just a breach of trust but also like.. a direct violation of her bodily anatomy because she felt disgusted and violated.", ">I told him exactly what happened that night and he kicked her out not even a week later.\n\nIn your OP, you say you slept with her at your buddy\u2019s place three times, then you broke it off and she started calling/texting you and your wife, so you blocked her and stopped hanging at your buddy\u2019s, and she eventually moved out.\n\nWhich is it?", "So, aside from the obvious plot holes in your story (she was your friend\u2019s roommate, but he kicked her out a week after you told him you slept together; she started falling for you after you\u2019d slept together 3 times but now say it was all in one night), what did you think would happen when your wife got to the party to pick you up? \n\nYou knew your wife was coming. You knew Kenzie was there. Yet you didn\u2019t think to give your wife a heads up? What was the game plan here? \n\nYTA. I get that you didn\u2019t know she was going to be there, but you made the decision to stay and you made the decision to omit this info to your wife, knowing full well she was going to have an issue with it. \n\nAs someone who\u2019s dealt with a stalker myself, I literally cannot imagine staying at a party where he was in attendance. I don\u2019t understand your reasoning at all.", "Ignore the misandry, this woman is a stalker with no respect for your relationship - But- you are still TA.  Don't stay at parties you are at without your wife if your stalker is there.  They see that as an invitation.  I was stalked in high school; I learned the hard way just not to be around him socially, period.", "Stop putting her down at all. You\u2019re the one who welcomed her into your life repeatedly. And then you decided to stay in the same party as her? Why?", "Ah, okay, so I would consider that to be cheating, so you might want to see if you can figure out if your wife feels the same way. If Kenzie hadn\u2019t shown up, I\u2019d just say leave it behind you, but as you\u2019re in the situation now, it might be a good idea to make sure you understand just how much of a transgression she thinks it was.", "That means you were cheating. \n\nYou weren't broken up when you were still sharing the same bed AND having intimacy.", "Words matter, and the ones you use are inconsistent.\n\n\u201cMy ex\u201d\n\u201cNever had interest in Kenzie\u201d\n\u201cWant to sleep with Kenzie, your childhood/teenage crush, for years\u201d\n\nYou also are not very good at communication.

You didn\u2019t even have the decency to tell her that Kenzie was there?\n\nOh, and you DID CHEAT - you may have been on a \u2018break\u2019 but living together, sleeping in the same bed, having sex with her without protection then having sex with Kenzie elsewhere makes you a liar & a cheat. \n\nThe audacity to blame Kenzie for \u2018manipulating\u2019 you & being your \u2018crush\u2019 is wild. You contradict yourself constantly (never interested in Kenzie vs wanted to sleep with her for years). I wonder what lies you told her to make her act like this. You even make weird excuses about the hug \u2018out of nowhere\u2019 and \u2018took you a minute\u2019 to stop her. You \u2018guess\u2019 she was near you. Suuuuurre.
