Maybe about an hour in, I'm pretty drunk and out of no where Kenzie is hugging me and trying to engage in conversation.

Your wife is right, you should have left or looped her in right away. Random ex, no biggie, everyone needs to grow up and move on, but the \"on a break\" ex and her behavior afterward is a no-go zone.", "YTA.  You should have let your wife know she was there when you texted her asking her to join you.", "Sorry bud, YTA,\n\nNot necessarily for not leaving, but given your history with this person, you should have told your wife she was there.

I have a lump in my stomach because that woman was stalking you, no wonder your wife has such a visceral reaction to her.

I hope seeing you doesn't rekindle her stalker behavior.", "Wow you showed no respect to your wife  by giving her a heads up that   Kenzies was there.

I get that it isn't a great phone or text conversation, but she needed to know because you've broken her trust before. Forgiveness and accepting someone back don't mean blindness. Kenzie is the biggest ahole for refusing to leave you alone. But I think you are a bit of one too for not either being straightforward or choosing to leave, even is the party was fun. Is there any party worth losing your relationship.", "YTA. \n\nThe first time you didn't tell her because you wanted both the sex with Kenzie and to continue having unprotected sex with your now-wife and knew that being completely honest would put a stop to one of those things. \n\nThis time you didn't tell her because you \"really didn't want to leave\" and knew she might ask you to if you told her. \n\nThat means BOTH times you've betrayed her have involved Kenzie and BOTH times were because you cared more about your own fun than your wife's feelings and right to total honesty.", "Major YTA\n\nyou admit to breaching the trust in the relationship with this person and then act pissy that your wife doesn't want you around them? \"Kenzie\" comes near you, you walk away. She speaks to you, you walk away. \nYour wife gave you a second chance, not the other way around. Show her even a crumb of respect. Get a grip.", "YTA. Good luck gaining her trust back... AGAIN.", "NTA - Sounds like you handled it fine. Kenzie is the AH, and it sounds like your wife is jealous. You don't have to leave a party because someone you slept with six years ago is there.", "NAH (except for Kenzie)\n\nFirst of all, you didn\u2019t cheat on your wife six years ago so nothing to feel guilty about there. Second, you responded appropriately to a Kenzie\u2019s advances at the party. Your wife has every right to be wary of this woman, and yes it would have been better if you had told her, but unfortunately alcohol does impair our judgement so you get a pass there.\n\nNext time, communicate with the wife and manage the situation together.", "NAH\n\nYou handled the situation as you saw fit, and as far as you were concerned effectively.  However, from your wife's point of view, Kenzie has been a point of contention for years and instead of leaving as soon as you realized she was there you hung out and continued drinking for several hours before calling for a ride home.  AND you texted your wife during that time without ever telling her Kenzie was there.  She's understandably upset because it looks like you chose to disrespect your wife.  You're understandably confused because you basically told Kenzie to f\\*\\*\\* off the second you saw her and repeatedly asked your wife to join you before realizing that wouldn't happen and leaving.\n\nI think you need to apologize to your wife for not communicating the situation to her in real time and not handling it the way she expected you to.  Explain that you thought you handled it effectively since she didn't talk to you after the first time and you just wanted to spend some time with your friend, but that you realize that wasn't the right decision.  Then the two of you can come to an agreement on how any future incidences will be handled by both of you, whether it's just you, just your wife, or both of you together who encounter Kenzie somewhere.  Putting together this game plan as a couple will give both of you the security of knowing that neither of you want this woman in your lives and that clear expectations have been set so that you won't have any of these misunderstandings going forward.", "NTA.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Cause back when everything happened between Kenzie and I.. the whole reason anything happened that night was because she told me she didn't feel safe staying the night alone with my buddy because he was trying to get in her pants.

If Kenzie hadn\u2019t shown up, I\u2019d just say leave it behind you, but as you\u2019re in the situation now, it might be a good idea to make sure you understand just how much of a transgression she thinks it was.", "That means you were cheating. \n\nYou weren't broken up when you were still sharing the same bed AND having intimacy.", "Words matter, and the ones you use are inconsistent.\n\n\u201cMy ex\u201d\n\u201cNever had interest in Kenzie\u201d\n\u201cWant to sleep with Kenzie, your childhood/teenage crush, for years\u201d\n\nYou also are not very good at communication.

You know how your wife feels about her\u2026. You could have just been honest and let your wife know that she showed up. Having her discover on her own that you were essentially hanging out with an ex FWB is pretty shitty.

Oh well. She needs to GET over it or leave you. But this pettiness doesn't serve anyone.\n\nYou did nothing wrong in the case. Your wife is being ridiculous.

Not by a ton, but you should\u2019ve left when she arrived.", "Yeah, YTA but this is totally salvageable.  Show your wife this post, tell her you realize how badly you messed up and maybe do something special for her.\n\nThat said, good job shutting Kenzie down otherwise it had potential to be marriage-ending.

Also the girl is borderline stalking you guys not okay.", "Many think SO should never bring up an affair after things have been sorted.

You should have told your wife that your ex who she clearly does not like was at the party.

Should've noted in your story that you were also still actively sleeping with your \"ex\" (unprotected at that), while living under the same roof and sleeping in the same bed.

Yeah, you caused that.", "Plus op should file for a restraining order if he is really that bothered", "This right here. You should just tell your wife you don\u2019t actually love her and care for her the way that she thinks(maybe) you do.

He was supposedly \u201csplit up\u201d but needed to apologize and be forgiven because he was still having sex with/living with/sharing a bed with his current wife while also sleeping with the psycho acquaintance.  He seems perfectly willing to be misleading to make himself look better.", "I suspect he encouraged Kenzie, or at least didn\u2019t discourage her as much as he claims.
