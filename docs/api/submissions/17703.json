So me(26m) and my friend (25f) have a somewhat successful podcast/internet show together. I'm not here to promote so that's all I'll say about it. It's longform content but video is important. It's pretty much a part time job for us. We get ad revenue and donations and monthly support from friends. It's also important to note that she is my best friend. We were neighbors as kids and we've been best friends my whole life. She is a sister to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe do the majority of our shows at the in home studio(spare room) but we do remote stuff to when we can't meet up. I travel for my day job and record from hotel rooms and airbnbs at times. We have a system where everything recorded on both ends is immediately uploaded to the shared drive after recording. So clear footage from my end and her end then it's edited together. I was remote and she was in her room. We were recording and wrapped up. But when I saw the footage in the drive I was wondering why hers was like 40 minutes longer than mine. Usually our videos are roughly the same length. I opened the footage and cut like 20 minutes before the end. My friend is naked in her room. She accidentally left her camera going and it just ended when the card ran out of space. Not a big deal to me. I still saved the footage because I need the raw footage and when I do get around to editing. I would obviously cut off that part. I even sent her a text explaining that she accidentally left her camera on and I saw her naked. She was like \"lol sorry\" and was embarrassed. But we are like siblings so it really wasn't a big issue. I told her I'd erase it once I was done with the footage\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLater I get a text from her girlfriend asking if I had a nude video of her. I explained why I do. She told me I need to erase it. I told her I need the raw footage. She said I need to erase the end part. I explained to her that to put the whole raw footage software, cut the end part off, and render it again would take up way too much processing power and that I need my computer. I'll just edit and cut off the last 40 minutes. She keeps saying that I am weird and an asshole. My friend is telling her she is overreacting but it's just becoming a whole thing\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT\n\nthere seems to be a lot of people ignorant of how video editing works. Let me shortly explain. So we have about 4 hours of raw video footage. She uses an expensive HD camera. Meaning that one file is a huge huge file. To put that raw footage in editing software, trim off 40 min, re render in the same HD quality as before. Meaning basically a copy of the 4 hour footage. It would take like 10 hours of rendering. I use my computer and edit for work. When you have a video rendering. Your computer is slow and can only render at that moment. You can't run another program, you can't edit a new video. You can't even watch a video without it taking up computer space. If I had a more expensive laptop it wouldn't be as bad. But that is where I am at. Basically don't have 10 hours to not use my computer or the hard drive space to do a huge thing like that.

It wasn't like you kept the camera on after the recording (which you had no control over) or kept this a secret from her. You were upfront, she made a mistake, and clearly she is comfortable enough with you to trust that you were going to delete it when you were done with the video editing. \n\nIt also wasn't like it was footage of her doing sex acts or with another person. It was just her naked. \n\nThe GF likely doesn't know you as well. She needs to trust your friend that you are trustworthy.", ">EDIT  \n>  \n>there seems to be a lot of people ignorant of how video editing works\n\nYour co-worker's girlfriend is one of them. That's why YTA.\n\nYou have possession of something that gives the appearance of scandal. I obviously don't have to tell you that having a surreptitious naked recording of a female colleague, when you're a man, is considered extremely creepy. So when it becomes known to a member of the public, even a public of one, your first duty is to give an assurance that you will do everything necessary to right this wrong.\n\n\"I'm so sorry and embarrassed this happened.\"\n\n\"It must be taped over right away.\"\n\n\"The fix is a bigger tangle than you realize but we're gonna get it done.\"\n\nNobody wants an explanation of why you can't get it done.

If this will take extra time and you need your computer and what not, do it overnight or re-do the episode.\nIt might take a while longer maybe another day or week, maybe you'll be behind on things but her girlfriend also matters in this story and your friend seems a little too nonchalant about it, as do you.\nI don't care what your motives for keeping that footage are, they could be innocent or not but it doesn't matter. I am sure you wouldn't be happy if another person saw your SO naked even by accident. You said you can understand she's upset so respect her and delete it/edit it and render even if it takes 10 hours.\n\nI do animation on AE , I know what it's like to have your computer focus on that one render for an entire day but this isn't something meaningless like a video of your friend eating or talking to herself, it's a video of her naked and she has a significant other, who also needs to be respected.", "Info: why even tell her?", "I'll need to see the footage in question to determine who the asshole is.
