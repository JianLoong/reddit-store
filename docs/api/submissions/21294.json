{"id": 21294, "submission_id": "14qbz8o", "title": "AITA for telling my sister I would not want her raising my children with her values?", "selftext": "My wife Freya (30f) and I (31m) have three children together ages 7m, 5m and 2f. From the time Freya was pregnant with our oldest we have spoken about who should raise our children if the worst were to happen to both of us. We ended up approaching someone in my wife's family who agreed they would step in should we be unable to raise our children. We have confirmed with them every time we have added to our family. They are still on board. We also have close friends of mine who are our backup and another backup from my wife's family.\n\nMy sister Viv is not on our list of people we would want raising our children. We never brought the topic up around her so we felt we were safe. Then one day she asked us if we had made plans for our kids if we were to die and we said yes. She assumed we had decided on her and announced we should have asked her first. I told her we had not put her down. She was shocked. She said as the closest family member she would anticipate she and her husband would be our first choice, seeing as they have two of their own children. I said we could not possibly put that much extra strain on their household (not how I actually feel but I was trying to be nice). She said it would be no strain and was acting as though we had said we would change it.\n\nI told her we were happy with our choices but thanks. She asked why I would want them over my own flesh and blood raising my children. Freya pointed out that her flesh and blood are our first choices. Viv dismissed that. She repeatedly asked why and over the course of a few weeks why we did not choose her and why I did not choose her specifically. So I told her I would not want her raising my children with her values.\n\nFor context: She has a boy and a girl. She does not believe in boys doing \"domestic women's work\" and does not believe girls should be doing \"male handiness work\". So her son will never have to prepare his own food or clean up after himself, her daughter will. And her daughter will never learn how to repair something around the house, replace a tire or any kind of DIY/mechanical work but her son is learning that stuff. Even mowing the lawn is \"boy work\". She has commented before on our boys (7 and 5) learning how to make their own sandwiches and basic cooking with my wife or with me. It's not how she would do it/does do it.\n\nBut I don't want my boys to grow up seeing women as servants and I don't want my daughter to feel like she isn't capable of taking care of certain tasks herself. \n\nMy sister claimed I was discriminating against her traditional values. I told her I do not want to teach my kids those values. She is free to do what she wants with her children. She also claimed it was a petty reason to pick everyone but her to raise them in the event of the unthinkable.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1688468015, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qbz8o/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_would_not_want_her/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was raised with these values (currently 29M) and I can't cook for shit. I learned to iron my own shirts at the age of 27. At 23, I flooded my parents house because I put washing up liquid in the dishwasher instead of one of the little tablets. The list goes on. It sounds funny until it's not, when I moved out from my family home I hadn't got much time to learn a lot very quickly (as I'd been working since I was 16, and do some unsociable hours), my girlfriend hated how poorly 'house trained' I was and I spent some time embarrassed about it despite being very willing to learn the things I should have known by that point. If I was raised on your morals I would have been much better prepared for adulthood and I wish it was the case. Your children will be very thankful for this later in life.", "Definitely NTA. Your sister is entitled to her own beliefs, but she is not entitled to your and your wife's children.", "NTA for obvious reasons", "NTA. Your kids, your choice. I agree with your reasons but you don\u2019t actually need to explain yourself to your sister. \n\nBesides all that, children ARE a major strain and if your and your wife die, their needs around grief and probably many emotional issues would add to that strain. It takes a huge and loving heart to want to take all of this on. I would be happy to raise my sisters kids if anything happened, but I would also be happy to not raise them. The fact that your sister keeps pushing the issue is strange. Just tell her that you appreciate her huge loving heart and hope she can continue to be a positive family support, but your decision is final.", "NTA\n\nAt the end of the day, they are your kids, even of the worst happens. You are doing what is best for your kids in the worst case, and chose the person who has similar values to you.", "NTA, gosh, I feel sorry for her own children. And I would not be afraid to tell her that. Good for you for not letting your kids (and their future partners) down. Do not use the term \"traditional values\", next time the conversation comes up remind her you are not living in a patriarchy any more and her SEXIST family values have no place in future.", "huge NTA - you tried to spare her feelings multiple times and she continued to push for an answer. don't ask questions you don't want the answer to. plus your reasoning is solid.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust refuse to dscuss it, nothing good can come from that discussion.", "NTA. She insisted on asking about this over and over again and you just told her the truth. Nothing wrong with that.", "NTA. You have every right to choose someone you think will raise your child the way you would want them to be raised. My ex and I chose my sister over his because although my sister is child free and his sister is a parent, my sister believes women are people who deserve agency and rights, and his sister is conservative.", "NTA. You tell her you disagree with her parenting, just the same way she disagrees with yours. And you chose someone who is more aligned with your parenting because that\u2019s what you want for your children and how you would raise them if you were here.", "My mom & dad, born in 1918 & 1921, respectively, had 3 boys and two girls. We all learned basic cooking, laundry, cleaning, along with basic auto care, yard care & household maintenance. My first paying job was mowing lawns. Second was babysitting. I've never changed a tire, but I do know in general how to do it. I can check the oil, get myself out of a snowdrift & jumpstart a car. People who hold to those rigid gender roles are doing their kids a major disservice. NTA.", "NTA ironic your sister is crying about discrimination but is teaching her children exactly that", "NTA - But you also could have said \u201cyeah sure, you\u2019re on the list\u201d or whatever and then in the very unlikely, very tragic event of both of your deaths, the executor of your will would have to tell her that she\u2019s not having the kids and you can both laugh from the grave", "NTA you believe in raising well rounded kids, while she is stuck in the good old days ideals of dependency. Also, she is kind of a shit for the badgering over not picking her. Blood doesn't mean shit when raising anything other then your blood pressure", "NTA.", "NTA. I find it weird that she would continue to push the issue here. It shouldn\u2019t matter what your reasoning is, your choice should be respected."]}
