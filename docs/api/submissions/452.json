My MIL has known me since I was a child. She was chill with me until my wedding. The moment I got married to her son, she started behaving strangely. She would indirectly comment how my husband could have got a better wife (deal shouls be a more appropriate term though), she would keep commenting on how I cannot cook and will also talk bad things about me behind my back.\n\nI used to get upset and tell my husband that I am not going to tolerate this behavior. He would ask her to stop saying hurtful things to me. But she never stopped. Even when my husband and I moved to another country, she would call me and say hurtful things. Despite that I bought her gifts and wished her on occasions and she completely ignores those gestures from my side. \n\nThe last time had a fight with her was when I had an important presentation to get my research degree. I was busy preparing and could not call her for a few days. But I mostly answered her calls to the best of my capability. I even told her the reason for my unavailability. Yet she texted me that I do not consider myself her family and blah blah. She also said things to other relatives about my behavior. \n\nNow my husband asked her to not say these things to me. That's all. My MIL now doesn't talk to me. But my husband has very strong connection with her. I feel less valued. Like, he does not understand what her mother made me face. There's no consequence for her behavior. My husband gets angry with me if I point out that he cares more about his mother and does not prioritize my feelings. Now he is not talking to me. And I really think he does not see me as his family. AITA for wanting my husband to prioritize me more?\n\n\nPs: throwaway for obvious reasons\n\nUpdate: husband has agreed to cut down on his contact with his mom. I would not want him to go NC, but at least limit his contact with her and he agreed.", "created_utc": 1667154554, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhm0q8/aita_for_fighting_with_my_husband_over_mil/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is not standing by you and protecting you from his mother. From now on, have no contact with her. Let him deal with her. I'm sure this is probably a cultural thing, but she is abusing you.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You are his partner in life. Of course, he should put you first.", "NTA for asking but he will never do what you ask. He is a mama's boy, not a man. You have degrees and the ability to make a life for yourself. It's time to do that without being tied to an abusive family.", "I get that this is a cultural thing, but it\u2019s also the 21st century.  You can do a lot better than a grown man who still lets his mommy tell him what to do.\n\nGet a job, get an apartment, and get a divorce.  Do not get pregnant.\n\nYou are throwing away the best years of your life trying to please a bitter old shrew.  Let it all behind.", "NTA. He needs to be more firm with his mother. Just asking her obviously isn't stopping it. I would stop giving her gifts, stop any calls, don't answer when she calls. Cut her off. Not the right choice him not giving repercussions for his mother's behavior but doesn't mean you actually have to tolerate it.   \n\n\nYour husband doesn't see you as his family??", "NTA. Your MIL is a bully and your husband is doing the bare minimum to stop it.", "NTA for wanting it. Now your MIL is an AH, but I think that you need to make your husband stay up for you and you need to ask your MIL, why she is making such comments and why she is like this. But I think you may have hurt your husband saying that he doesn't care for you. Obviously, I have no idea what your relationship is like with your husband and what his relationship is like with his mother.", "NTA. I literally could care less whether I ever see my husband's twin sisters again in this lifetime. All the badgering and bullying presented as helpful guidance is just not what I want to spend the rest of my life negotiating. (One sister is actually easier to deal with than the other. But, she will still always back her twin's play - even when her sister is dead wrong. So, whatever.)  I think we got along great for years until I told them once that I was not modifying a health management plan for their brother to please them. (They wanted something other than what the doctor recommended and I could not support that because it was emotion based and not medicine - just emotional insecurity posed as logic. No thanks.) I didn't even say \"HELL NO!\" I just said, \"That won't work for me.\" And we've been at odds all these years since.\n\n I only explain my silly life story to demonstrate that its easy to get over people's BS and walk away from it and put it down. Not your baggage? You don't need to carry it. I don't take calls from my SILs. I don't race to see them and when I am forced every few years or so to deal with them face to face, I pretty much ignore whatever silly jibe they toss out. It has taken the wind from their sails and since I don't covet their good opinion or disdain it - they are a lot calmer now. Like I said, not caring and not being available have been truly restorative for my peace of mind and sense of well being.\n\n Let your husband manage his own mama and YOU take a mental health break from her BS because its not like she's ever going to stop being mentally unstable. (He will be the hardest to retrain. Just tell him your absence keeps the peace and stick to it.) \"I'm happiest when there is no argument honey. That's all I focus on.\" Now that its established I won't be bothered and don't care? My SILs have only their brother to whisper and hiss at about me and he tells them to knock it off. #winning. Its been more than 20 years and I'm still in charge of me. \ud83e\udd23", "NTA but I think you need to accept that this is never going to change.  I'd recommend stopping all contact with MIL--no visits, don't take or make calls, let your husband be the only one who deals with her.  If hubby gets upset, just say very calmly that she does not respect you and won't stop abusing you so you will have nothing further to do with her.  If he won't support that, divorce or a lifetime of abuse are your only other options.", "Stop answering her harassing calls. If your husband asks you about that, just say you didn't realize she'd called. It will take her a few weeks to get used to the new paradigm. But, if you get out of her way on that, she'll adapt. She'll amp up or she'll ratchet down - but she will change. Let her be the one looking like a fool while you stand clearly in the sunlight having done nothing to cause her melt downs. Always beat a b werd at her own game.  (And understand that if you keep defending yourself o him, your husband won't see where she's flawed because he will keep defending her to you. Force his hand. Say nothing bad about her. Just let him see her the way she is.)\ud83e\udd23", "NTA, time for a divorce.", "NTA for your feelings on the matter, but your approach puts your husband, who is caught in the middle, on the defensive. He cannot control his mother. He is not going to keep her out of his life. But he would advocate for you more if he didn\u2019t spend his time on the defensive. You don\u2019t need to make comparisons. That\u2019s child\u2019s play. And it\u2019s insulting. So keep away from the comparisons, and try to keep her out of your life. You\u2019re under no obligation to be anything other than civil. You might want to figure out if hubby is complaining to his mother about you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
