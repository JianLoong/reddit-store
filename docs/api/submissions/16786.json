Dad worked there but mom ran the whole thing and she was the driving force behind it. The bakery was named something with Sun in it. When my parents had me four years later they named me Sunny. My mom had a very complicated pregnancy and delivery and I was going to be their only child. So they named me after the bakery. I always loved the connection and it was especially meaningful because my mom died when I was 7. Dad kept it running with help, so I could take it over one day if I wanted to, so mom's legacy never died. He got sick when I was 16. It was tough. He fought as long as he could but he died when I was 18 and I took over the bakery. I baked from a really young age and dreamed of running it one day. So I took over as the head baker and have kept it open myself for a decade now. In that time I met and married my wife Lila, she started working there and her mom and sister also joined the small team we have. It was going well until a few months ago. We were at Lila's parents house, her whole family was there, and they brought up how the name for the bakery feels wrong when the family has changed so much. Lila told them the bakery is still mine and given the history and who named it, they shouldn't think they would get a say in any of it. It was dropped for a while. Then they brought it up again. Lila again reminded them that it was none of their business.\n\nLila is expecting our first child now and she hasn't been working as much, or at all these last couple of months, and I have noticed some comments here and there from MIL especially about \"darling bakery names\" or how nice businesses names are when they tell you it's a family run thing. I would internally roll my eyes but smile and say those were great names for those people's businesses. Clearly she got annoyed because then her and my SIL cornered me recently and told me that they felt like they had such a big part in it, which they don't, that the name should reflect the family and not just me or what my mom had wanted to call it. I told them I will not be changing the name just because they work there and if that is a problem there is no reason for them to force themselves to stay if they don't want to. Both told me they do want to work there and told me I was twisting what they said, that they just want to feel more included and like this is their family business too. MIL told me that unless we plan on naming our child some sun related name, it's just going to be a random name in the future. I pointed out many businesses are that. But they told me I was being deliberately obtuse. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683635805, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13coioe/aita_for_telling_my_ils_i_will_not_be_changing/", "score": 10197, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In that time I met and married my wife Lila, she started working there and her mom and sister also joined the small team we have. It was going well until a few months ago.

With the next business opened they kept the family out.\n\nYou NEED to set some clear boundaries with the IL.  It sounds like they want to make it their family business that they have a share of and can control.  Do they have employment contracts?  If not, I would suggest you speak with your business lawyer explain that it appears these family members, although just employees, are trying to have a stake in your business and you want to make sure they are only employees and nothing more.  I don't  like how they are talking about how it's family run, etc.  If, heaven forbid,  you got sick and couldn't run the bakery for a while that would be a time they could take over things that you might not be able to fight.  Please get legal advice.  Your IL's need undersatnd that it is YOUR family business, you are the sole decision maker and will not entertain any changes to your business.  Maybe you should have your baby's middle name with sun in it you you can prove to them its not some random business name and it is related to the family you are creating with your wife and child.

I just had people staring at me because of how much your ILs made me laugh. \n\nDEFINITELY NTA\nIt sounds to me like they want the clout of being able to tell their friends and family. Your mom built that business from the ground up, your pops kept it going after she passed. Not to mention, with your pops growing ill around you being 16yo and passing after you turned 18, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if he had stayed alive those two years from sheer willpower to ensure that you could legally own the business. \n\nFcuk those ILs, you were right to give them the choice to stop working there.

Below are 6 examples:\n\n>Constructive Discharge Scenarios\n\n>The following are some scenarios that could qualify as leading to a constructive discharge.\n\n>Employee was\u00a0the victim of sexual harassment by a\u00a0supervisor or boss\n\n>Employee\u00a0was\u00a0the victim of sexual harassment by a co-worker and complained to management, but management\u00a0failed to address the problem, which then continued\n\n>Employee\u00a0was\u00a0treated badly\u00a0at work\u00a0because of their age, sex, race, national origin, religious beliefs,\u00a0or disability\n\n>Employee\u00a0made a reasonable complaint that they\u00a0believed they\u00a0were being treated badly because of age, sex, race, etc., and management responded ineffectively and the environment became even more hostile.\u00a0This is known as an unlawful retaliation claim.\n\n>Employee\u00a0took leave under\u00a0FMLA, sought overtime to which they\u00a0believed they\u00a0were entitled, sought a reasonable accommodation under ADA, or filed a workers' compensation claim,\u00a0and thereafter was retaliated against by the employer\n\n>Employee\u00a0made a\u00a0whistleblower\u00a0complaint and was\u00a0thereafter subjected to a hostile work atmosphere\n\n\nWhen I referred to reducing hours it wasn't intended to mean *cut their hours in half immediately* you start with slashing 1 shift in half and see how things progress over the next few weeks before moving forward. If hours were cut from 40 to 16 then yes, I could understand where that may be a hostile work environment with the potential to win a constructive discharge lawsuit. But changing someone's schedule as the owner of a business because that employee is no longer an asset of sorts but rather becoming a burden? Constructive discharge truly seems like reaching in that case imo", "Definitely, I just mean for the interim before baby is born.", "Oh this would be such a nice touch. I'm a sucker for both a great bakery and a great back story - I'm sure telling the story on your website would not only benefit you by charming your customers and giving them a deeper connection to the bakery, but in case your in-laws try to take their idea into the court of public opinion, it will be very hard for them to sway people against a well-known \" feel good\" story!\nWhile you're at it, OP, maybe have an open house/free samples to celebrate your mom's birthday? Maybe bring the local news for a good PR small Bud success story? \nThe best defense for this is to push the namesake of this bakery and the story far and wide - your in laws will look like villains ( and maybe? If they have a shred of dignity? ) feel like villains and cut that shameful shit out.", "Look, OP, I'm not jumping in with the post-nuptual crowd here. Not exactly.
