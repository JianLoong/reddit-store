Dad worked there but mom ran the whole thing and she was the driving force behind it. The bakery was named something with Sun in it. When my parents had me four years later they named me Sunny. My mom had a very complicated pregnancy and delivery and I was going to be their only child. So they named me after the bakery. I always loved the connection and it was especially meaningful because my mom died when I was 7. Dad kept it running with help, so I could take it over one day if I wanted to, so mom's legacy never died. He got sick when I was 16. It was tough. He fought as long as he could but he died when I was 18 and I took over the bakery. I baked from a really young age and dreamed of running it one day. So I took over as the head baker and have kept it open myself for a decade now. In that time I met and married my wife Lila, she started working there and her mom and sister also joined the small team we have. It was going well until a few months ago. We were at Lila's parents house, her whole family was there, and they brought up how the name for the bakery feels wrong when the family has changed so much. Lila told them the bakery is still mine and given the history and who named it, they shouldn't think they would get a say in any of it. It was dropped for a while. Then they brought it up again. Lila again reminded them that it was none of their business.\n\nLila is expecting our first child now and she hasn't been working as much, or at all these last couple of months, and I have noticed some comments here and there from MIL especially about \"darling bakery names\" or how nice businesses names are when they tell you it's a family run thing. I would internally roll my eyes but smile and say those were great names for those people's businesses. Clearly she got annoyed because then her and my SIL cornered me recently and told me that they felt like they had such a big part in it, which they don't, that the name should reflect the family and not just me or what my mom had wanted to call it. I told them I will not be changing the name just because they work there and if that is a problem there is no reason for them to force themselves to stay if they don't want to. Both told me they do want to work there and told me I was twisting what they said, that they just want to feel more included and like this is their family business too. MIL told me that unless we plan on naming our child some sun related name, it's just going to be a random name in the future. I pointed out many businesses are that. But they told me I was being deliberately obtuse. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683635805, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13coioe/aita_for_telling_my_ils_i_will_not_be_changing/", "score": 6545, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He fought as long as he could but he died when I was 18 and I took over the bakery. I baked from a really young age and dreamed of running it one day. So I took over as the head baker and have kept it open myself for a decade now. In that time I met and married my wife Lila, she started working there and her mom and sister also joined the small team we have. It was going well until a few months ago. We were at Lila's parents house, her whole family was there, and they brought up how the name for the bakery feels wrong when the family has changed so much. Lila told them the bakery is still mine and given the history and who named it, they shouldn't think they would get a say in any of it. It was dropped for a while. Then they brought it up again. Lila again reminded them that it was none of their business.\n\nLila is expecting our first child now and she hasn't been working as much, or at all these last couple of months, and I have noticed some comments here and there from MIL especially about \"darling bakery names\" or how nice businesses names are when they tell you it's a family run thing.

So many people have entitlement issues.", "Just admit you were wrong dude", "Ew.", "Bot", "But it doesn\u2019t sound like the wife is the problem, her parents are. Even if OP divorced and their wife was entitled to a cut that wouldn\u2019t entitle her parents to anything.\n\nIt\u2019s not a bad idea regardless, but I don\u2019t think her parents could get their hands on anything even then.", "The fact that the OP's wife, MIL AND SIL have been working there makes things murkier in terms of it being a premarital asset as their labor has contributed to the success of the business.\n\nOP needs to talk with a lawyer.", "Yeah, considering his wife is a daily contributor to the business by working there, I'm not sure if that would blur the lines. If she received a strict salary vs acted as proprietor would likely make a difference", "[Here\u2019s](https://keystone-law.com/community-and-separate-property-characterization-of-a-business/) a good rundown of the issue as it applies in California.", "You should have had zero rights to that house but money does funny things", "Step one would be to change the name to their family name.\n\nStep two would be to ask for a % of profits because it is a family business with their name on it too.", ">these people don\u2019t even own the biz!\n\nyeah, but they *feel* like they own it, therefore their *feeling* must be taken into consideration and treated as reality!    /s", "No, it doesn't.  It's a very clear boundary.  The ILs are to blame for this alienation, not OP.", "I actually disagree that the change will be childish and think it would be fully appropriate to say.\n\nI just think that the original wording will explain things better as it will give a clear and concise reason why they are being terminated if they continue.", "lol. yup. you're one of those. \n\n\"I'm on the internet and tough. gotta make others admit if they're wrong. it's what makes me thrive.\". go be pathetic someplace else kid.", "Hence why to consult an attorney, because if they divorce, it\u2019s likely the wife would lean on her family and they\u2019d sway her, rather than her continuing to be on OP\u2019s side after they split up. (OP, I hope you don\u2019t get divorced.)", "Unless they are not getting a salary, they are not contributing to the business.  If that were the case, I would own a hospital right now. LOL", "Flat wrong. Spouse is due their half of the gain in any asset that is jointly owned/paid for. (and in fact, is usually due half the gain of any asset, period, regardless of who paid for it, thus the eyepopping divorce settlements of wealthy businessmen, but in the case of joint payment of expenses, joint ownership of the gains is very clear.)", "And just as bad, their opinions on how to run it. ugh\n\nNTA", "If you fire them, they could be entitled to unemployment. Not sure about financial/legal implications for a small business, but something to consider.", "Notice I didn\u2019t say what is legal. I said pre-marital property SHOULD not be part of the discussion. So thanks for the expose on things I already knew but let\u2019s work on our reading skills. Thanks", "Costs of unemployment for two people is going to be significantly less than fighting for ownership in court", "Yeah, I'd reduce hours/pay and force them to quit.", "True, I suppose, but it's cheaper still to make them uncomfortable by simply treating them like any other employee. Once it's clear that they have nothing to gain by working there except normal wages for hard work, they'll leave. Worst case: OP can write them up as needed until they can be fired for free.", "They would still be eligible for unemployment that way since it would fall under \"constructive dismissal\"."]}
