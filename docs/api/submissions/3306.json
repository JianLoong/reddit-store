No one knew about the bed-wetting thing til we spent a night at my mother's house. Sophie had wet the bed in the guests room and my mother found out. My wife and I explained the situation, offered to clean the mess up, then ask her to not tell anybody about what she saw because Sophie is already in a bad place mentally and would not be able to handle any comments from family about this she even said that she will stop visiting if this gets out. My mother crossed her heart and promised us and we thought this was the end of it.\n\n\n\nOn Thanksgiving dinner that was held at my mother's house. While we were eating and talking about a bunch of stuff, my brother mentioned that his dog peed in the kitchen. I looked at my mother and she looked like she had a \"similar story to tell\" and that's what she loves to do. Just gossip and share \"similar stories\". I knew what she was going to say when she opened her mouth and said \"speaking of pee.....\" I felt helpless and tongue tied I couldn't even speak so I just let out a loud fart as a means of distraction. Everyone stopped and stared at me. It was very awkward people were going \"eww...\" kids laughing (including Sophie) just a mix of reactions. But my mother was livid. She started berating me later about behaving disgracefully and shamelessly on thanksgiving dinner table no less. I admitted it was on purpose to stop her from sharing an embarrassing moment of my stepdaughter and potentially traumatizing her for years to come. She laughed at the word \"traumatizing\" then called me childish and said I should be ashamed of myself for pulling this stunt at her home....on her thanksgiving dinner. We had to leave and my wife and Sophie were laughing but still had no idea why I did it.\n\n\nNow my mother is upset and so is my father because he had invited his friends and now I made him look bad.", "created_utc": 1669499996, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5j7zv/aita_for_farting_on_thanksgiving_dinner_when_my/", "score": 2354, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Had to wear pull-ups to bed every night, and I felt so ashamed. I questioned whether anyone would want to marry a bed-wetter.

By the title I was expecting you to stand up, turn around, and literally fart ON the food, which would've been kinda fucked. But no, this was just an S tier level timed fart.

Always the stories that make other people feel bad. \"haha, remember that time you freaked out and broke your cousin's nose for sneaking up behind you.\" Yeah, I definitely remember. I had recently been assaulted by a strange man who snuck up behind me. I was in the midst of dealing with that when my asshole cousin thought it would be hilarious to do and say the exact things the man who assaulted me did, knowing full well what had happened. My uncle still tells the 'hilarious' story of nose breaking, while continuing to omit the lead up. That's why I won't go to family events he attends. Your stepdaughter will feel the same way about your parents if they keep this up. It's like some people never learned compassion.", "NTA\n\nOn a related note, have you brought your daughter to the doctor about those night accidents?

Certainly came in handy this week!", "NTA.

In any other scenario I would find this gross and completely inappropriate, but you literally saved the day and your stepdaughter\u2019s self esteem by putting yourself out there!

I say this with absolutely no irony whatsoever, but making a fart joke at the dinner table is so much classier than gossiping about a teenager's \"accidental bed wetting\" if that's really what your mum was about to do.\n\nAnd she probably doesn't know it but you probably protected your mum from embarrassing herself from sharing an obviously inappropriate story about someone else at the dinner table. That could not have ended well and it would be your mum bearing the brunt of social judgement for telling that story.

When I was her age, my eczema was so bad I had to change my pajamas & sheets at least once a night because the open sores would bleed and ooze and literally make my bedding/PJs wet and sticky. It was disgusting and it prevented me from having sleepovers with my friends, because it was so embarrassing and gross, and I was terrified of anyone finding out how gross my body was (in my mind back then, now I recognize it wasn\u2019t gross, it was a serious health concern). I had to shave my head because the eczema on my scalp was causing some of my hair to fall out. One time someone made fun of my appearance, joking that I looked like some movie or TV character thy was a burn victim or something similar, I cried for days. Even though I can\u2019t remember the character or show, I remember the kid who made the joke and how hard the other kids laughed when he showed the picture. Every time I see him I remember it. Hell, every time I see photos of me from that time frame I remember it. You protected your stepdaughter from a similar situation, but not just some idiot 10th graders being mean \u2014 where she\u2019d be embarrassed by her step-grandma in front of multiple family members. \n\nYou rock as a stepdad for anticipating your mom\u2019s reaction and immediately doing something embarrassing yourself to prevent Sophie from being upset.", "Spectacular move, distracting everyone from discussing your daughter's embarrassing bodily functions by letting fly with an embarrassing bodily function of your own.
