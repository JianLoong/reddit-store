No one knew about the bed-wetting thing til we spent a night at my mother's house. Sophie had wet the bed in the guests room and my mother found out. My wife and I explained the situation, offered to clean the mess up, then ask her to not tell anybody about what she saw because Sophie is already in a bad place mentally and would not be able to handle any comments from family about this she even said that she will stop visiting if this gets out. My mother crossed her heart and promised us and we thought this was the end of it.\n\n\n\nOn Thanksgiving dinner that was held at my mother's house. While we were eating and talking about a bunch of stuff, my brother mentioned that his dog peed in the kitchen. I looked at my mother and she looked like she had a \"similar story to tell\" and that's what she loves to do. Just gossip and share \"similar stories\". I knew what she was going to say when she opened her mouth and said \"speaking of pee.....\" I felt helpless and tongue tied I couldn't even speak so I just let out a loud fart as a means of distraction. Everyone stopped and stared at me. It was very awkward people were going \"eww...\" kids laughing (including Sophie) just a mix of reactions. But my mother was livid. She started berating me later about behaving disgracefully and shamelessly on thanksgiving dinner table no less. I admitted it was on purpose to stop her from sharing an embarrassing moment of my stepdaughter and potentially traumatizing her for years to come. She laughed at the word \"traumatizing\" then called me childish and said I should be ashamed of myself for pulling this stunt at her home....on her thanksgiving dinner. We had to leave and my wife and Sophie were laughing but still had no idea why I did it.\n\n\nNow my mother is upset and so is my father because he had invited his friends and now I made him look bad.", "created_utc": 1669499996, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5j7zv/aita_for_farting_on_thanksgiving_dinner_when_my/", "score": 287, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Bravo for throwing yourself on that grenade.", "An excellent display of 'taking one for the team'. \n\nWell done, dad!\n\nNTA\n\nI have an overactive bladder, and wet the bed until about the age of 14. Had to wear pull-ups to bed every night, and I felt so ashamed. I questioned whether anyone would want to marry a bed-wetter. It took a very, very long time to admit publicly that I even *used* to wet the bed. So I can't imagine how humiliated I would have been if someone brought it up at the time it was happening.", "NTA.

NTA Obviously...", "NTA\n\nYou stopped your mother from trying to humiliate your stepdaughter and you did it in a harmless and funny way. \n\nIf I can offer a quibble: you refer multiple times to farting ON the Thanksgiving dinner or ON the table. If I were to pick a nit, maybe refer to it as AT the thanksgiving table? The mental image I had at first was of a grown man walking up to a turkey and aiming a fart directly at it.", "NTA you are an amazing stepdad, your mom seems to care very little on Sophie\u2019s well being I think you and your wife should sit your mother down and talk to her, if she can\u2019t be loving and supportive of Sophie you need to talk with your wife and is having Sophie around your mom worth it if she doesn\u2019t care for Sophie\u2019s well being.", "NTA How uptight are these people that a fart gets you kicked out of the house?", "NTA also you dropped this: \ud83d\udc51", "NTA but a living legend", "NTA.

You could see the ambush coming, the enemy was going to launch their attack against a child, doing their best to humilliate and shame for no reason but the pleasure of doing so.

NTA and extra points for hilarity and ingenuity", "That was an interesting way to stop the conversation.  How would anyone know that it was intentional if you hadn't said anything? It sucks that your mother seemed about to break the confidentiality she agreed to.

By the title I was expecting you to stand up, turn around, and literally fart ON the food, which would've been kinda fucked. But no, this was just an S tier level timed fart.

Definitely good dad moment in my book.", "NTA and you are an absolute legend. i hope your stepdaughter can get her health problems sorted soon. best wishes!", "NTA. There are people like your mom in my extended family and I have full on declined to visit any of them for over 20 years. They tell and retell and laugh at the same stories every time. Always the stories that make other people feel bad. \"haha, remember that time you freaked out and broke your cousin's nose for sneaking up behind you.\" Yeah, I definitely remember. I had recently been assaulted by a strange man who snuck up behind me. I was in the midst of dealing with that when my asshole cousin thought it would be hilarious to do and say the exact things the man who assaulted me did, knowing full well what had happened. My uncle still tells the 'hilarious' story of nose breaking, while continuing to omit the lead up. That's why I won't go to family events he attends. Your stepdaughter will feel the same way about your parents if they keep this up. It's like some people never learned compassion.", "NTA\n\nOn a related note, have you brought your daughter to the doctor about those night accidents? I had them too until a very advanced age (15ish?) and never went to the doctor because I was ashamed of it.\n\nWrong decision. When I mustered the courage and went... Doctor gave me a few pills and the problem was gone in a month.", "NTA. I can't stand people who \"can't help but share\", and let's be fair. It worked!", "NTA 10/10 Awesome dad move!", "NTA you are an amazing stepdad and Sophie is lucky to have you", "NTA and well done! That was class A parenting right there and I hope Sophie appreciates you (even more so because obviously you taught yourself how to parent well lol)", "SHEEEEESH \n\nNTA x100000\n\nAlways keep a man who has one ready in the chamber for moments like these! Damn what a father. Honestly that's so awesome! \n\nI wouldn't talk to or visit mother anymore. She has proven to be incredibly horrendous.", "NTA! A super hero! You can fart on command? Certainly came in handy this week!", "NTA. I can\u2019t imagine acting all precious about this when she was ready and willing to betray a confidence and devastate a child who\u2019s having a difficult time.

Your mom is TA here for sure. I'm so impressed that you were able to get that fart out on command like that, you're one hell of a father!", "Best stepdad ever!", "NTA - If she shared that, it would have been even worse for the family.

Saving your daughter from embarrassment is awesome.

Not all heroes wear capes!\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou made my day! That was a great way to stop your mother from humiliating your daughter without the girl realizing what was going on. Perfect!\n\nOn the other hand you might want to talk to your wife about your next steps. Your mother doesn't honor the promise she gave to keep quiet about this. To avoid your daughter being hurt, you might need to take some drastic steps like a low contact.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re a hero, and hilarious. Anyone who gets offended by a fart is a nerd.", "Your mom sucks. You do not. NTA.", "NTA \n\nYou're a flatulent guardian angel", "NTA but boy is your mom one. I can\u2019t even imagine a relative let alone a grandparent embarrassing their grandchild like that.

I applaud your well-timed, on-demand flatulence. \ud83c\udf89", "NTA but perhaps pretending to choke would have been more socially appropriate than a sonic stuffing-infused toot.

What a brilliant way to protect your child. Bravo.", "NTA. You took the bullet for your daughter. Top man. Plus you made all the kids laugh. Well worth it.", "You made him look bad? So much worse than his wife embarrassing a child would look? You're my hero. Obviously NTA", "NTA - this is hilarious and a spot on distraction. I'm impressed that you can fart on cue. \n\nYou truly prevented some long-term trauma from happening.", "NTA\n\nYour mother was the childish one, she was going to use your stepdaughter\u2019s accident as a funny story", "NTA. \n\nMay your butthole serve as a shining example to us all that the greatest of farts serve to protect others from humiliation and shame.", "NTA and we shall call you Farticus, you fell on the sword of flatulence without fear. Fantastic.", "NTA you sound like an awesome (step) fart-ter! \n\nAfter reading the title I thought that you had actually farted on the dinner rather than at the table.

Good for you. I suggest diapers at night for step-daughter.", "Maybe not the most fitting award but take my free one as you certainly were an amazing helper to your stepdaughter, jumping on the landmine that is your mum in her stead.  NTA, but in all seriousness your going to want to talk to your wife about why you did it, come up with a battle plan about how to tackle your mum and layout in no uncertain terms what will happen if she can't keep her mouth shut, maybe you know some things she would rather not see the light of day", "NTA.... Not all heros wear capes :P Some of them fart at thanksgiving :D", "NTA & saving your daughter (who cares about DNA, pure Dad move) from embarrassment", "NTA---love how you protected her. No child/person needs to be shamed for something they have no control over.", "NTA but three cheers for the noise that escaped you!\n\nYou have to consider whether you want to be in full contact with your mother.

To be fair, you didn't fart ON dinner, just at dinner.  Much better to make your mom mad than embarrass that poor girl.  You did good.", "NTA.  How dare your mother be willing to do this to Sophie.  Good for you protecting her.  Your mother sucks.  I\u2019d keep her away from Sophie.  Tell her if she ever shares that story about Sophie, you will go no contact.", "NTA!!! In any other scenario I would find this gross and completely inappropriate, but you literally saved the day and your stepdaughter\u2019s self esteem by putting yourself out there! I never would\u2019ve thought farting on command was a superpower, but you are most definitely a superhero!! Your fart story made my day!!!!", "NTA but perhaps we should have a brief conversation about prepositions.

If I had that kind of intestinal control, my kids would be better off.", "I love that you embarrassed yourself on purpose to protect your stepdaughter from being embarrassed.\n\nNTA of course. I say this with absolutely no irony whatsoever, but making a fart joke at the dinner table is so much classier than gossiping about a teenager's \"accidental bed wetting\" if that's really what your mum was about to do.\n\nAnd she probably doesn't know it but you probably protected your mum from embarrassing herself from sharing an obviously inappropriate story about someone else at the dinner table. That could not have ended well and it would be your mum bearing the brunt of social judgement for telling that story. Your dad would have even more reason to be embarrassed.\n\nAt least the fart was funny in a way. The bed wetting story would not have been.", "NTA. My hero.", "YTA  - very soft YTA.

Ugh!\n\nBTW, you didn't make anyone look bad -- well, maybe yourself, but it was a self-sacrifice in order to spare Sophie, so worth it.

I understand them maybe being upset you did it purposely,  which is impressive bodily control,  by the way, but, it making them look bad, is just just being ridiculous. \nIf they have problem with you \"embarrassing\" them, then maybe your mother needs to take a moment to truly think about how embarrassing it would to be singled out and have such a personal issue publicly announced. \n\nBravo", "NTA of course and great job protecting your step daughter!
