{"id": 168, "submission_id": "yi5u8t", "title": "AITA for not giving her the pictures of her dying dog?", "selftext": "I (27, female, photographer) moved to a different country some time ago and made new friends. One of them with a beautiful but already quite old dog and we always joked how cute he would look on pictures.\nLast week she texted me and told me how sad she was that her dog don't have much time and she would love some forever memories (pictures) of him, so I immediately offered her to snap some pictures for free and also told her I would edit them for free but due to me being quite busy I can only offer around 5 pictures for free. \nSo yesterday we met and I took some really cute pics of the pooch. Afterwards I put every picture with a watermark in an online gallery, sent her the link and told her she should choose 10 pictures she wants for free. Today she told me that she would appreciate if I could send her all 30 pictures but I explained to her that I don't give out unfinished work since it's my work and I only want the polished endproduct out in the world. She got really mad and told me multiple times that she doesn't understand why she can't just have all of the pictures and even promised me she wouldn't post them on any social media. Also accused me of trapping her in a situation where she would have to use money to get the rest of the pictures. I feel quite sorry because her dog probably has not much time left and I understand that she wants those pictures, so I am wondering if i'm the bad person here or if it was correct to stand my ground?\n\n\nEdit (is this the proper way to do it?): \nBecause of some comments here I decided to send her all the pictures unedited. I know how it feels to loose a companion and it can be tough and yes, she is not a client, you guys are absolutely right on that one. 5min earlier however she received the folder, called me and asked me why there is still a visible leash, collar in the pictures. Ngl, that left me slightly confused, however I explained that removing unwanted elements is a part of my editing process. She demanded I could atleast use that ?filter? on the pictures so it looks like her baby is running free. I really tried to explain to her that it's not a filter that I can just apply with a click. It's not alot of work, it's not complicated but it still takes some time. She was NOT happy to hear that", "created_utc": 1667207510, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yi5u8t/aita_for_not_giving_her_the_pictures_of_her_dying/", "score": 141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've gone above and beyond for this person, and she is walking over your kindness.\n\n~~NAH~~. Your offer is very reasonable and you've been extremely helpful to her throughout this situation. Meanwhile, from her perspective, I also understand why she may be upset since sending the un-edited photos has no cost to you, especially since she promised not to share them. They'd simply be for her to have a memory of her beloved pet. If she was asking you to edit all 30 of them, that would be unreasonable. Given that you're not doing this for money anyway, it may be worth considering it more of a personal favor (which it already is) rather than work.", "**With the Edit:** NTA  \nYou offered an inch, she asked a foot. You gave a foot, she demanded a mile.\n\nShe's a choosing beggar. You offered, also sent her what she asked for beyond what you offered.\n\nAnd then she went on to even demand even more ***again,*** which is exactly what you were afraid of in your **second, kind free gesture.**\n\n\"looks like her baby is running free\" are you fucking kidding me, the entitlement. Get your own filter.", "NTA\n\nListen, she's in an emotional place rn and lashing out at you, and being entitled too but that might be just her emotions again. But you had a deal and the conditions don't change just because she feels like it. She can take pictures herself if she doesn't want to pay, your offer was very generous and sweet and she should appreciate that.", "NTA. But I can see why she's upset if she didn't understand in advance, she may have thought that she'd get 5 edited pics and the rest unedited. \n\nHopefully once she's got her 10 photos and once the emotions have come down a little, she'll be more likely to understand.  \n\nBut this is your career and it's nice enough that you took the photos for free so tbh she should be grateful about that. I hope she can see things with a bit more of a level head when she feels a bit calmer.", "NTA.\n\nIt's rough, but what you offered was fair. This is what you do for a living and she can't expect to get your labour for free if you hadn't offered to do so. That said, she is grieving and having a hard time choosing the photos she wants, which is why she wants them all. I would go ahead and honour your original agreement and pick the 5 you think are best and gift her those.", "I understand where you're coming from, but you have already taken the pictures and will not be editing more of them. That means it costs you nothing to let her have the pictures. \n\nI know what you're saying about having unpolished photos 'out in the world' but these won't be, really. It's not a portfolio or an advertisement of your work. It's just a kindness to a friend. \n\nShe is being rude to demand and make accusations when you have already done something kind. It's poor behaviour, for certain. But it's also in a difficult time where it probably feels really hard to pick and choose which memories to keep and which to lose. \n\nI can't call you an AH. But I think this is a time when it really wouldn't hurt to let some unedited photos go.", "A reasonable compromise would be to just give her all the unedited shots as is and just don't identify yourself as the photographer.  \n\nOtherwise...  inch/mile.", "NAH, can understand both sides, however, while completely understand wanting to protect the quality of your work that's out there maybe consider this situation a bit differently, I'd assume you're not expecting her to put them on social media etc with a caption in vein of \"my beautiful dog, miss her so much, photo by xxx\" or people to respond with \"aw, so sorry, but who took those photos?\" These are for her and memories not as a way that could bring more work", "Edit 5 and give her the rest unedited and just ask to not be tagged in them if it\u2018s so important to you", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019d call you an AH is you weren\u2019t a professional photographer though. As a professional, you have every right to ensure that all of your work reflects your professional standard. You told her in advance that she couldn\u2019t have all of the photos. She has no right to demand that you alter your business practice for her. You did a very nice thing for your friend and she is being incredibly entitled.", "It's a metaphor...she just wants pictures she doesn't care about there quality", "NTA and she\u2019s not your friend.

You\u2019ve been nice, she\u2019s just asking for more now - and I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s about the dog anymore, she just wants professional photos for free", "NTA. Your a professional photographer and did her a favor. She\u2019s acting quite entitled to expect all of the pics for free. She can take pics of her dog and doesn\u2019t NEED professional pics. I understand how hard it is to lose a beloved pet, and I also wouldn\u2019t use any of my photographer friends for free prof pics. I\u2019d rethink this friendship if I weee you\u2026", "NTA but your friend is an entitled pooper...there is never a good reason to take advantage of a good friend. One who is offering most of her services for free I may add.", "I could \\*see\\* the edit coming--OP finally, graciously gave away all of the pictures, only to have the recipient criticize what was given.  \n\nOP, you need to dump this person as a friend.  They will only continue to take, and then criticize you for being unwilling to go along with it.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nAgreement was 5. You voluntarily then upped it to 10 when you didn't need to. Now she wants 30 for free! Just tell her what you would have charged for 5 if she'd come to you as a regular client and hopefully she'll see that 10 is a good deal and she's taking the pi$$ asking for 30.", "NTA\n\nYou were kind to offer your usually income-generating services pro bono to a friend, and you even took it a step further by doubling your initial offer of 5 free shots. She may have misunderstood the terms, she may be unusually \"needy\" because she knows she's losing her dog, or she might simply be one of those greedy ass people for whom nothing is ever enough. Regardless of the root cause of her current feelings of entitlement, she should be paying you in gratitude if she's not paying in cash. \n\nThat said, you may consider removing your professional watermark from the unedited shots and giving them to her, with or without going ahead and editing the original 5 or 10 pics. Removing the watermark would presumably remove any link back to you as the photographer and likely eliminate the risk of the unprocessed photos affecting your business, while at the same time saving the friendship. That's completely up to you, of course, because I don't think you would be an AH for standing your ground, either.\n\nEdited: typos", "I am going to go with a soft YTA. I don't think she expects all 30 pictures to be professionally edited and Instagram worthy, she just wants pictures of her pooch to have that memory. I don't quite understand why you are not willing to give her the unedited pictures, as a friend. She's wrong for lashing out instead of trying to reason with you", "YTA this was a friend not a client.\n\nNo one will judge you on your professional skills   even if they know you,  but they will judge you for your lack of compassion.\n\nAlso she'd be happy with grainy polaroids", "NTA. People who expect artist friends to work for free are not cool.", "NTA.\n\nYou were being generous by offering her five pics for free, then upping the ante to ten. But as the saying goes, give an inch, some will take a mile.\n\nAlso, you made it clear from the beginning that this is the offer you're extending, and you doubled the number of your offer. She can't say she was misled. She accepted the offer as you presented it.", "NTA, she's being entitled and manipulative.  Ten photos for free is   generous.  Being in a bad plane doesn't give someone the right to take advantage of another person's kindness.", "NTA- you offered her free professional photos. If she.wants lots of photos she could of just taken some with her phone", "NTA. You were very generous to do that at all. She\u2019s very entitled. Who needs 30 pictures of a dog anyway? She\u2019s greedy, and just because her dog is old doesn\u2019t excuse that.", "YTA. You offered her a free photo shoot and 10 photos, which is a lovely thing to do. However you then sent her 30 photos and told her she could only choose ten, she was expecting you to send through the top ten photos to her free of charge, now she has to painstakingly choose just ten of them knowing that twenty photos of her dying dog will essentially be \u201cbinned\u201d unless she finds the money to buy them. You should have just sent her ten as originally agreed upon, I can understand why she feels like you\u2019ve used this as a chance to make money rather than as a kind gesture when her emotions are high.\n\nNot wanting to give her all the photos doesn\u2019t make you TA, but sending her all of them and saying she can only have ten is what made YTA. This is a friend, not a paying client, and someone you offered this to. Perhaps you could offer her the ten photos of her choice and then tell her that you can try and get around to editing the others but you can\u2019t guarantee how long it would take and it could be a year to get through them with all the work you have as work will have to take priority. Or offer her the ten and say you can have the others to her for a discounted price but it will take 4-6 months to get through them with work.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is easy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the pictures of her dying dog are THAT important to her, she can pay you your going rate to finish all 30 pictures.", "NTA. Screw her, pay up or shut up.", "ESH. She should be happy with your offer but at the same time you say she is a friend and you are treating her like a customer not a grieving friend", "YTA. Edit the 10 and give her the rest. Geez. It\u2019s not that hard. She\u2019s going through absolute heartbreak and you\u2019re worried about a few unedited photos going around.", "NTA. \n\nI think emotions are understandably running high and she's forgetting that she's getting \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 worth of free professional images and is stuck on that grief-stricken need to keep every memory of her dog close.\n\nHowever, this was the agreement from the start. If you weren't busy and if she'd asked gently maybe there'd have been room to edit more as an additional gift (I'm soppy about animals though!)... but you ARE busy, and she has been pushy about it.\n\nI think when people see what they can't have they feel like they're missing out. If you'd said you'd provide 5 and done the selects yourself perhaps she'd feel less like she's entitled to them because they're \"there\". If she had not seen the additional images she may not have been pining for them so much.", "I'm a dog person, and I won't deny I'm being entirely subjective, imo YTA. If you said it was supposed to be a business transaction for a client, then you would've been in the right, but you're talking about someone who's supposedly a friend going through a rough time.", "NTA. She contacted her friend who she knows is a *professional photographer*. She should expect it to be a business transaction that have rules you\u2019ve put in place. You\u2019re not just someone who bought a camera and she\u2019s not doing you any favors by letting you photograph her dog. From your perspective it\u2019s another job. If she doesn\u2019t understand what she\u2019s getting for free, let her know how much she already dodged paying.", "NTA", "NTA", "I feel like YTA. I understand you have a business and you need to make money, but she is a friend and she is grieving.  She isn't asking you to edit the photos. The rest of those pictures are just going to sit on your hard drive or you'll delete them, or what? Do what with them exactly? She won't have her pet for much longer. Is it really worth it to hoard them like that?\n\nI have a photographer friend that always gives the entire album away for things like this, especially pets and babies, you know what that does... It gets her MORE business.  Like really I get it, I get that it's your business. Ultimately it seems like such a small thing. When my pet died, even the blurry photos meant so much to me. You could just decide to do a kindness. What will it cost you? Really. Will it really cost your business that much?\n\nAlso you can learn your lesson to just not do this again in the future if it's such a big deal to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would not have posted all 30 - I would have taken just a few (enough for you to handle for free) and that was it.

My friend who did the flowers happened to see it and was very surprised and decided to use extra flower from my bouquets to use on the cake and it turned out beautiful!

You offered your professional skills for free, and told her to expect 5 photos. You upped it to ten, and then she wanted everything.

You want your work to be your best and also still invest time to paid work, but she's greiving her dying doggo. I do think the compromise of the unedited photos never going on social media is a reasonable arrangement, but it can also be hard to enforce because A.) what if it's down the line and you both have broken contact, so you'll never know if she never posts the unedited photos and B.) you will look like the asshole if you confront her should she post them anyway and potentially hurt your professional reputation. There's not an easy solution here except for trying to talk it out like adults and finding a compromise that is good for both parties.", "YTA I sincerely doubt any casual inquiries about the pictures, if they're ever seen by a third party, will affect your reputation. Charge her more if you must or take time to edit them to your liking, but losing a dear friend/family member shouldn't involve this kind of drama. She can also take her own pictures if she still has time, but this is not a simple graduation or wedding shoot - have some compassion in the face of pending grief. Some of you have never experienced true loss and it shows.", "Oof that edit by op though.", "That was my thought. She's doing this whole thing as a favor, but still marked them and placed them in the online gallery. I can see why the friend would feel like OP was trying to get her over a barrel. Not that I think that was the intention. If I was in OPs shoes I would have just done the pics, maybe some editing, and just let the friend have them unmarked, not treated this the same as a paying client.

I do sympathise with the friend, losing your pet is harsh and knowing that moment is getting closer and closer absolutely sucks, but I don't think that gives her the right to demand this pictures.\n\nOp does this as away living, and she's making her friend a favour and she's acting entitled. Op explained why she doesn't feel comfortable sharing the unedited pictures, if she wants professional pictures she needs to pay professional prices. I think op was being very nice by offering 10 pictures free of cost but this is her job at the end of the day, and I don't think she should make an exception (more than she already has) because then everyone would ask for one too.\n\nETA: in op's edit she demanded she edited the pictures too.

It\u2019s like asking your friend who is a seamstress to tailor a button on your wedding dress for free then showing up with 10 buttons and a lot more work being done that in terms of total time needed, really isn\u2019t fair to OP as they have made a very nice offer as it", "Yeah when the friend received the raw pictures, she was upset at OP because she didn\u2019t photoshop the collar and leash out", "I understand but from context I thought this was an actual friend.\nFor instance as a computer programmer I won't even talk to a potential client without being paid.\nA friend?\n\n  I'll bang it out to spec and send it out without a thought...well except for some common sense provisions", "Wow.

So they may only get part of your expected pay from a wedding because the client stole screenshots and shared those instead of buying the digital print edited for however much. It\u2019s part of why they have to protect their business. They don\u2019t get all their pay up front and their reputation depends on good quality finished photos being shared and not the unedited ones.     \nThey can take 100 photos but the person only wants 20 of them and they prefer specific ones. So you have to allow them to see what they are ordering but you can\u2019t spend hours editing 100 photos for them to choose 20 and then only get paid for a fraction of your time IF they actually order them. But that means clients are seeing unedited photos that they also then steal and don\u2019t buy the final copies edited and still share them. It\u2019s a balancing act and unfortunately it hurts the photographer a lot. \n\nProgramming has a way to pay for the project up front different than something as subjective and opinionated as photography. You get specs to work with, photographers have to see what they get and try to manage people into good photos which isn\u2019t always easy and sometimes means you can\u2019t get exact things to meet specs and deliver a package deal, the client has to select from options of what they like best in the end. And that\u2019s where photographers can get hurt.", "Ummm.  Ok?"]}
