There is coverage for underinsured or noninsured driver. \n\nI mean, if all someone has is their beater that got in an accident, there's nothing to go after in a legal suit. Sure I can get a judgement, but the old saying is you cannot get blood from a stone. What, I get $5/month for the rest of my life? \n\nAlso, if you have a $90K vehicle, you should have your coverage increased - as many have an accident limit of $100 or $150K, that's not even two vehicles if it's higher end autos.", "Same thing that happens if you injured someone while not in a car, and a court finds you liable.", "\" i started recording before I even confronted her, made sure to get a thorough video of the damage and her plates.
