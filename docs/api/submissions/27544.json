They made it very clear that my dad would be paying, and that my name on it because my dad was in property some years ago and got the old house repossessed (long story). I didn\u2019t want to, but was emotionally pressured into saying yes because in my culture, an eldest son has to provide for their parents.\n\nWhen they eventually found a house, I was asked by my dad to head to a lawyer\u2019s office. I was sceptical, but went anyway to sort the paperwork. This was the first time I\u2019d ever done anything like this and my dad was impatient with me for wanting to understand everything I was being asked to sign. He kept convincing me I didn\u2019t need to read everything or know the meanings of all the terms and accusing me of not trusting him or my mum enough. I was again pressured and signed the papers but was unhappy. That house purchase eventually fell through and the whole ordeal just stressed me out.\n\nThe next time they asked, I put my foot down and said it did not sit right with me because prices were too high, interest rates were too high and  I don\u2019t earn enough to buy the kind of house they wanted. My dad was calm, but disappointed. My mom exploded. She accused me of being selfish, uncaring and called me a bad son. She mentioned how other people\u2019s children would do it without asking and brought up all she\u2019d done for me as a child and how ungrateful I was for denying her. It honestly broke my heart. She said that she\u2019d ask my sister (28F who earns more than me fyi) to do it instead and how I had two choices: pay \u00a3500 (which is like 1/3 of my wages) towards rent a month or gtfo within a week. I was so shocked. I\u2019d never in a million years thought my mother would say such things to me. I told her I\u2019d pay for rent and anything else she\u2019d need, but it\u2019s causing stress.\n\nToday, my mother asked again. I told her that I didn\u2019t want to talk about it again and she went on another tirade. She said I wanted to abandon our family and that I\u2019d never have a single penny in the house. I\u2019d essentially be treated as a lodger, paying rent and any other cost or she wouldn\u2019t let me live there. She said so much and I just sat there silently because I didn\u2019t want to argue anymore but it made me so upset. I\u2019m torn. I really love my parents. They\u2019ve given everything for me and I want to help them, but I don\u2019t earn enough money and this kind of risk just scares me. Am I the asshole for following my conscience and my heart and saying no, even thought it\u2019s strained our relationship, or should I just put my name down and see it through?\n\nEDIT: Thank you sm to everyone who replied but don\u2019t disrespect my parents, even if you mean well.", "created_utc": 1695565539, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16qz0p4/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_buy_my_parents_a/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

With a repossession on file, most lenders offering competitive rates won\u2019t touch them, which means sub-prime borrowing from another lender at a higher rate.\n\nAlso, you cannot be named on two residential mortgages (unless by special exception agreed by underwriters), so if you\u2019re looking to get your own place at any point before your parents\u2019 house is paid off, then you would need to come off their mortgage - and that\u2019s a lot harder than it sounds, as it has to be agreed by the lender. \n\nIn this situation, I would take the hit on rent - you can still leave whenever you like. \n\nIf your new \u2018arrangement\u2019 is an attempt to get you to pay the mortgage by stealth, it won\u2019t work: most lenders won\u2019t take a lodger\u2019s rent into consideration when assessing affordability. \n\nAs for your sister: I don\u2019t know what her situation is, but some lenders aren\u2019t keen on having people named on the mortgage that don\u2019t live in the property. And if she already has a mortgage, then she\u2019ll almost certainly be unable to co-sign. \n\nBest of luck.", " NTA, and take your mom\u2019s advice and gtfot. She probably doesn\u2019t think you actually will.", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. I\u2019m a parent and I can\u2019t imagine asking one of my sons to do this. You are 25 so it\u2019s time to start your own life without your parents trying to use you for something that could ruin your financial future.", "NTA\n\nThe crux of their argument is that you don't trust them. The problem is that it's true. You don't, nor should you trust them. If they need you to cosign its because they don't qualify on their own. If they don't qualify, they are either buying outside their means, they messed up their credit, or they have a bunch of debt. All these are reasons not to cosign. This would also prevent you from buying your own house (assuming you haven't already). \n\nAt the end of the day, your parents are putting themselves before you.  Do with this revelation as you please", "NTA- leave and get your own place. Get a roommate if necessary.", "Huh, apparently you don\u2019t love me enough to say something so shitty to me.   I am not going to risk my financial wellbeing.", "Your mother is herself all those things she accused you of: selfish and uncaring. There's **so** much wrong with everything going on here. \n\nIf you were going into a contract with a stranger and they bullied (yes, bullied) you to sign papers without reading or understanding them, how would you react? How much worse is it that your own parents are trying to force that? \n\nEverything that was done for you as a child? That's called parenting the child you brought into the world.\n\nNTA", "Don't co sign. But at 25 if you are living with your parents, you should be contributing to household expenses. Nobody should need to ask you, but once you start earning you should have started giving them money... They should not have to ask you.\n\nESH.", "Even if your parents make every single payment on time, unless you start making 6 figures+, you won\u2019t be able to buy your own home until this mortgage is paid in full.  You might not even be able to get a car loan.  NTA.  Don\u2019t do it.", "Your culture is dumb.", "You\u2019re absolutely right, but when I brought this up once they flipped at me and said that I don\u2019t trust them. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t want that because it\u2019s too long term a commitment and idek if I wanna keep living in the country at all. But as you might guess, it didn\u2019t make much of a difference what I said", "This the reason why they need you is they can\u2019t get it on their own, but if they default again you can\u2019t get a home.\n\n\nOp move out , let them ask your sister , but I pray she also tells them to kick rocks.", "My rule is, only \"loan\" money you can afford to lose and assume that is what will happen with it.  Otherwise, will lead to stress later.", "Thank you, I appreciate the sympathy and I\u2019ll try my best to be independent :)", "Thank you, I appreciate you understanding that it\u2019s my choice. That\u2019s the one thing I\u2019ve wanted most from all of this. Just the ability to choose without some moral judgement weighing me down from the people who should be supporting me most.", "What attorney (presumably) overheard that last conversation and allowed the process to proceed?", "She doesn\u2019t have a job because of an injury and low qualifications so it\u2019s either me or my sister. My other brothers are too young to work atm", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

You can have more than one if the bank believes you can comfortably afford it - at least where I'm at.  But that's a lot of money, so chances of him being able to buy his own place when he's ready are very slim if he does this.", "NTA. Your parents are huge selfish AH though. You\u2019d lose first time buyer\u2019s privileges such as not paying stamp duty etc  (or small % depending on cost of the house) if you buy a house with your parents. You should work on getting a better paid job so you can afford to move out  because your parents sound very manipulative and selfish and not acting in your best interests.", "\"Why yes, I don't trust you. You've already defaulted once already, so that makes it likely to happen again. And when I expressed reasonable concerns your response was to emotionally blackmail and guilt trip me, and refuse to let me review legal paperwork. Plus you don't even accept my agreeing to pay rent without complaints.\"", "They've had a house repossessed once before, this is a real concern!! Dp not put your name on a house they want to buy. The fact your dad was trying to rush you through paperwork shows the terms in it are not favourable to you and something underhand is going on. Be careful OP. Maybe consider moving out of their house. Yes your parents may have done lots for you over the years but that's their job, they chose to have you and shouldn't hold that over you to manipulate you into doing their bidding. Edited to add NTA.", "What\u2019s your sister\u2019s take on this? Is she willing to co-sign? I\u2019m highly doubtful. They\u2019re trying to guilt and manipulate you. Move out. Get your own place to rent. You don\u2019t need this heartache and headache", "You shouldn't trust them.", "NTA. Also, if your sister had said yes, they wouldn't be asking you again. If your sister makes more than you and isn't willing to do it, then that should tell you that you are correct in not wanting to do it either.", "Why should you trust them? They already had a house repossessed and the bank, whose business it is to be up on all their finances and what they can afford, does not think they are a good risk either. The best you could say is you don't think they intend to default... if you can say that.", "[removed]", "NTA but please move out and go low contact to get away from the verbal abuse and blackmail/manipulation of your parents.\n\nFind a roommate if necessary , cause at least you will have equal rights", "Depending on sister\u2019s circumstance - why not pay her $500 per month and live with her?"]}
