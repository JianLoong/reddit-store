They made it very clear that my dad would be paying, and that my name on it because my dad was in property some years ago and got the old house repossessed (long story). I didn\u2019t want to, but was emotionally pressured into saying yes because in my culture, an eldest son has to provide for their parents.\n\nWhen they eventually found a house, I was asked by my dad to head to a lawyer\u2019s office. I was sceptical, but went anyway to sort the paperwork. This was the first time I\u2019d ever done anything like this and my dad was impatient with me for wanting to understand everything I was being asked to sign. He kept convincing me I didn\u2019t need to read everything or know the meanings of all the terms and accusing me of not trusting him or my mum enough. I was again pressured and signed the papers but was unhappy. That house purchase eventually fell through and the whole ordeal just stressed me out.\n\nThe next time they asked, I put my foot down and said it did not sit right with me because prices were too high, interest rates were too high and  I don\u2019t earn enough to buy the kind of house they wanted. My dad was calm, but disappointed. My mom exploded. She accused me of being selfish, uncaring and called me a bad son. She mentioned how other people\u2019s children would do it without asking and brought up all she\u2019d done for me as a child and how ungrateful I was for denying her. It honestly broke my heart. She said that she\u2019d ask my sister (28F who earns more than me fyi) to do it instead and how I had two choices: pay \u00a3500 (which is like 1/3 of my wages) towards rent a month or gtfo within a week. I was so shocked. I\u2019d never in a million years thought my mother would say such things to me. I told her I\u2019d pay for rent and anything else she\u2019d need, but it\u2019s causing stress.\n\nToday, my mother asked again. I told her that I didn\u2019t want to talk about it again and she went on another tirade. She said I wanted to abandon our family and that I\u2019d never have a single penny in the house. I\u2019d essentially be treated as a lodger, paying rent and any other cost or she wouldn\u2019t let me live there. She said so much and I just sat there silently because I didn\u2019t want to argue anymore but it made me so upset. I\u2019m torn. I really love my parents. They\u2019ve given everything for me and I want to help them, but I don\u2019t earn enough money and this kind of risk just scares me. Am I the asshole for following my conscience and my heart and saying no, even thought it\u2019s strained our relationship, or should I just put my name down and see it through?\n\nEDIT: Thank you sm to everyone who replied but don\u2019t disrespect my parents, even if you mean well.", "created_utc": 1695565539, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16qz0p4/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_buy_my_parents_a/", "score": 209, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was a mortgage/financial advisor (fully qualified, though I don\u2019t do that anymore), in the UK and I would say a hard no to this. Not because of your parents\u2019 behaviour towards you (though that is outrageous in itself). \n\nMost mortgages hold all parties joint and severally liable: that means if your parents decide not to/can\u2019t pay, you\u2019re on the hook for the lot. With a repossession on file, most lenders offering competitive rates won\u2019t touch them, which means sub-prime borrowing from another lender at a higher rate.\n\nAlso, you cannot be named on two residential mortgages (unless by special exception agreed by underwriters), so if you\u2019re looking to get your own place at any point before your parents\u2019 house is paid off, then you would need to come off their mortgage - and that\u2019s a lot harder than it sounds, as it has to be agreed by the lender. \n\nIn this situation, I would take the hit on rent - you can still leave whenever you like. \n\nIf your new \u2018arrangement\u2019 is an attempt to get you to pay the mortgage by stealth, it won\u2019t work: most lenders won\u2019t take a lodger\u2019s rent into consideration when assessing affordability. \n\nAs for your sister: I don\u2019t know what her situation is, but some lenders aren\u2019t keen on having people named on the mortgage that don\u2019t live in the property. And if she already has a mortgage, then she\u2019ll almost certainly be unable to co-sign. \n\nBest of luck.", " NTA, and take your mom\u2019s advice and gtfot.
