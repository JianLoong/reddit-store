My daughter had been having problems with her anxiety and depression, school had been very hard for her and she asked us if she could get an animal for \u201cemotional support\u201d. I asked her why we couldn\u2019t just put her in regular therapy again but she said she didn\u2019t really like her last therapist. Basically she doesn\u2019t want to try it again.\n\nI was pretty against bringing an animal into the home as my daughter can barely keep her room clean and remember to wash her dishes, much less take care of an animal. And I absolutely refused to do anything for the dog because I work long hours and didn\u2019t want to be picking up messes when I got home. My wife said I was being unfair and that this could be what my daughter needed to get back in good spirits.\n\nSo we got her a dog. We let her pick out from few select breeds, since certain breeds tend to need higher requirements for care (such as frequent grooming and other traits) and I was against getting some breeds just because of personal preference. \n\nThe dog was great at first and it got along with my daughter and wife greatly. Me not so much, but it could probably sense I didn\u2019t really like it either. But then it started getting out of its leash on walks, tearing up the couch and various other toys we bought it. My daughter started forgetting to let it out, so I\u2019d come home to find poop and pee all over the brand new carpet. \n\nI warned her twice that if she didn\u2019t start taking responsibility that the dog would be going back and she gave me excuses saying she was feeling depressed again. She said she would do better, but didn\u2019t. Ultimately, I got fed up so one day when she went to school I loaded the dog in my truck and told the shelter he wasn\u2019t a good fit for us.\n\nObviously when she came home she was upset. She was saying the dog was her best friend but I told her that she wasn\u2019t taking very good care of him, and he didn\u2019t deserve that. Wife says it was very harsh to just take the dog back while she was gone, but she agrees daughter wasn\u2019t responsible. My daughter has been saying I brought back her severe depression and we haven\u2019t been talking.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667041099, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yggnja/aita_for_taking_my_daughters_emotional_support/", "score": 3770, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is a living creature and has needs, same way she does.

Did you sit down with her and explain kindly that she has this long or this many chances to get it right befor the dog goes back?\nHowever a dog is not a soother, it is an animal that needs attention, exercise and discipline daily. Your daughter clearly was not up to the task.", "Have you tried taking her to a medical doctor and not just a therapist? Depression can be a medical issue, not just something you can talk out.", "There's a lot to unpack here, but let's deal with your actual question first.\n\nThe dog was not being cared for. It really is that simple. Your family is not ready to look after a dog, so taking it back to the shelter was the right thing to do.\n\nThat said, I'm still giving this a hard YTA. You allowed your heavily depressed daughter to take on the responsibility of caring for a high maintenance pet. (All dogs need feeding, exercise, mental stimulation, no such thing as a low maintenance dog.) Then, after she had the dog long enough to bond with it, you took it away while she wasn't even there. That would hurt anyone, to someone suffering from depression that's a massive gut-punch.\n\n>she said she didn\u2019t really like her last therapist. Basically she doesn\u2019t want to try it again.\n\nSounds like she only tried it once. Finding the right therapist takes time. Talk to her, cajole her, beg her, bribe her, whatever it takes to get her into therapy with the right person. Don't force her, don't threaten her, make it so she gets something out of it. Try different therapists until one clicks.\n\n>And I absolutely refused to do anything for the dog\n\nRethink this. If she gets to the point where an ESA would really help her, why not put in a little effort? Same goes for your wife. You can ask your daughter to take over the dog's care as she becomes more capable. If she needed meds picked up daily, would you do it? Or would you say it's too much work?\n\n>We let her pick out from few select breeds, since certain breeds tend to need higher requirements for care\n\n>I was against getting some breeds just because of personal preference.\n\nYou went about getting a dog as if you were getting a family pet. You should have been looking for a dog that suited your daughter, one with the right personality. For a dog to become her ESA, she would need to bond with it very deeply. \n\n\n>it started getting out of its leash on walks\n\nHow? A properly leashed dog can't just 'slip out'. A properly trained dog doesn't try. Harnesses are a thing, and there's a reason they're often used for service dogs. The dog needed training, and suitable equipment. You provided neither.\n\n>tearing up the couch and various other toys\n\nAgain, training. Did you check with the shelter that this dog was fully trained? There's another aspect to the destructiveness too. Who was with the dog during the day? Dogs need companionship.\n\n>My daughter started forgetting to let it out, so I\u2019d come home to find poop and pee all over the brand new carpet. \n\nHang on, you work long hours, right? Where is your wife when this is going on? She can't be at home, she'd either clean up or let the dog out herself. I assume she works to be out of the house all day. You work long hours, your wife works enough hours that she isn't there for the dog but still gets home after you, and your daughter is at school. Who were you expecting to look after the dog, exactly?\n\nIt sounds like you don't know how to take care of a dog, or your daughter. Get her back into therapy, get her on medication, get her mental health treated. You can consider a dog later, and this time get something more suitable.\n\nSource for all of this: 25 years of depression and anxiety. Now fully medicated, had years of therapy, and was lucky enough to have two family dogs in a row that started looking after me with no training at all. The second one is now fully trained as my ESA, a job she seems to want!", "Info: What is it with people not communicating? Like how bad were your parents in raising you that communication flies right over your head? \"Oh my daughter is having issues let's make them worse by going behind her back to do this instead of sitting her down and being a father and talking to her more! That's the smart idea!\"\n\nYeah the dog can go to a better home now but seriously? All you did was show her you'll go behind her back to do things against her.\n\nBe a parent. Talk to her about why she doesn't want to try therapy again.", "Everyone but the dog sucks.", ">I asked her why we couldn\u2019t just put her in regular therapy again but she said she didn\u2019t really like her last therapist. Basically she doesn\u2019t want to try it again.\n\nYou jumped real fast to she doesn't want to try therapy again. There's other therapists. Find one.\n\nYou're treating your daughter right now like she treated the dog. You're not taking care of her, only giving her topical solutions for the underlying issue.", "NTA", "Okay, so this will likely be a super unpopular opinion but....light ESH. I will definitely explain my reasoning behind this.\n\nTake it from me who's had to rehome and take animals from people with depression issues: Animals are NEVER a good fix for depression, EVER! If the person isn't taking care of themselves, then they cannot take care of an animal and the animal will end up just as neglected as the person themselves. Your daughter alone is at fault for believing an \"emotional support animal\" will fix her mental health issues, but your wife also was in the wrong to villainize you for saying \"No\" and pushing the idea of getting her daughter a dog when her daughter didn't prove to be responsible. Even if a kid doesn't have depression issues, they need to do a lot of research and prove they're responsible enough to care for an animal. Kids and teens don't exactly understand yet that it's a life that depends on them for care, not a toy.\n\nBut the way you went about getting rid of the dog was very wrong. It was very sneaky, underhanded, and hasty. Your daughter may be a year away from being a legal adult, but in order to maintain a good relationship with your daughter that will last well until you are on your deathbed, you need to be open, honest, and not do anything behind her back. Taking the dog back while she was at school is a major violation of her trust and she's likely never going to trust you again with something she cherishes out of fear you'll take it away or destroy it behind her back. \n\nNext time, discuss your concerns with your wife, find a solution on how both of you will handle it, and then sit your daughter down with you and your mother and have a serious conversation about dog care and why you both feel it would be better for the dog to be in a home where someone can take better care of it, while also try and help your daughter understand that she needs to think about the dogs best interest, not her own. \n\nBut since that ship has sailed, I'd sit her down, give her a honest apology for violating her trust, and maybe even offer her to get another pet in the future....BUT only if she gets herself the help she needs for her depression. A dog won't cure her depression and it won't make her anymore responsible, which isn't fair for any animal. Whatever pet she gets in the future, the animal deserves to get the best from her, and if she can't provide that right now, then she needs to wait until she can.\n\nSegwaying from thag, it wouldn't hurt to convince her to get her back into therapy. She really needs it from the sounds of it and if she doesn\u2019t like the current therapist, then help her find another. She may almost be an adult, but she still needs you and her mother to step in and get her the proper help she really needs.\n\nBest of luck to you OP.", "NTA.

That dog was being neglected, you did the right thing.", "YTA, how can you know her mental health status, and still not realize what you're doing is cruel, when i was a child, (a teen) i have been irresponsible too with my dog.

I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle a dog, fish or anything which required a huge amount of attention, but I can care for cats. Cats are so easy for people with mental health struggles. So long as they are fed, watered, given proper enrichment activities and their boxes are regularly cleaned, they are super low maintenance pets. Just thought I would mention it if you one day decide to give the whole emotional support pet thing another go. (I\u2019d opt for an adult cat, not a kitten. Preferably 2+ years so most of their feisty teenage drama is a out of the way.)\n\nBut the daughter needs to demonstrate she can handle even that much responsibility first.

He worked hard to give us above and beyond and now we want and do same for him.\nI am disgusted with your story on how you handled your emotionally hurting daughter and an innocent dog.  Look in the mirror, I'm willing to bet you are part of your daughter's emotional health.", "I\u2019m sorry but I think ESH on this one. Yes OP you allowed the dog into your house even though you didn\u2019t want the dog in the first place. However, you have let your responsibility to your daughter fall flat. Depression is nothing to blow off and think that an emotional support animal is all that\u2019s needed. She needs meds and therapy. But, I also realize that you can\u2019t force your daughter to get help if she doesn\u2019t want it. I know in Washington state that at the age of 14 teenagers can start making their own health decisions. I don\u2019t agree, but it\u2019s the law. So I understand that you may not be able to make your daughter get help, but OP, you could have handled this completely different. You should be doing research on depression and asking around for recommendations about therapists for a 17 year old. Do your research on meds. There\u2019s a lot of antidepressants now, it\u2019s not limited like it was a few years ago. Plus it sounds like the family would benefit from family counseling as well as individual counseling for all of you. \n\nI understand that the dog was not being taken care of properly but from what you said it sounded more like \u201cpunishment\u201d than the best interest of the dog. Depression doesn\u2019t fit into a one size fits all category. Take postpartum depression. A woman can\u2019t form a bond with their child and gets overwhelmed at the prospect of caring for said child. (that\u2019s a basic definition. I had postpartum depression. I know how bad it is!) That\u2019s kind of how I see this situation with your daughter and the dog. You guys really need to get to the bottom of what\u2019s going on with your daughter because if you don\u2019t, things are only going to get worse.", "I can\u2019t blame you but would have tried to find a therapist to work with her and the dog. If she wasn\u2019t willing to do that then it would be best to find a better home for the dog. They do have programs that breed and train support dogs. They would actually train your daughter if she passed the screening process. This would take the pressure and responsibility off your shoulders! She needs to learn to manage her symptoms effectively.", "YTA for how you handled it!   I understand that she should have taken care of I but doing it while she was at school is just cruel!", "ESH- Emotional support dogs are prescribed by a medical professional. You can\u2019t just get a dog and call it an emotional support animal. \n\nAlso, it is cruel to the dog to adopt it and then return the dog because no one took the time to train them. You knew your daughter was not responsible enough to have the dog, so you should not have adopted in the first place. All of the behaviors you described are normal New dog behavior. They need time and attention.", "ESH, at 17 the dog should have had good care.  Get your daughter a new therapist.", "NTA for taking the dog back. \n\nBut YTA for adopting a whole dog. Dogs are not for kids, dogs are for the whole family. If you weren't ready to help your child take care of this dog, then you shouldn't have gotten this dog in the first place. \n\nI'm glad the dog isn't in your house. And I'm sorry your kid is upset.

I think you're falling to separate several issues here.\n\nIf a 17 y/o isn't capable of doing the most basic chores. She needs professional help. So yeah you could have traded your permission to have the dog for her agreement to try another therapist.\n\nWhen one is struggling already having their pet taken away will most certainly not bring any improvement. \n\nYour words sound very harsh and cold and uncaring - and that's in written form. I can only imagine how that sounds to the ears of your child. Do you make her grow up with an uncaring father? If so, why is that? \"It's always been that way and my dad brought me up just fine this way...\"? Maybe you should consider a therapist aswell.\n\nAnyhow. Its not fair to make the dog suffer for all of this but instead of getting him back to the shelter you might have considered trying to improve the animal's living conditions in another way.\n\nSo yeah... kinda YTA", "ESH the dog deserved better, but your daughter does too.

Your daughter was weaponizing her anxiety and depression to get what she wanted and then didn\u2019t follow through on her promises to take care of the dog.

Not AH. But she\u2019s soon 18 and should learn from you that you don\u2019t just get an animal to try to see if it works.

I'd like to call you out on putting emotional support in quotation marks and calling your daughter's depression an excuse. My dog has prevented me from killing myself more than once, has learned to tell when I'm depressed, and boops me with his nose to bring me out of my head and back into the world he lives in, which is a much nicer place. \n\nLook into DBT (dialectical behaviour therapy) for your daughter and present it to her as an option instead of unilaterally deciding what's best for her. She's old enough to have some say in her mental health care. There's a DBT workbook she can do on her own if she doesn't want to talk to someone. \n\nI agree she should not have a dog she can't properly care for, but getting rid of it the way that you did was unnecessarily traumatic and this could be due to character limit, but I don't see any discussion of you and your wife trying to help her using a schedule and phone/in person reminders to help her manage the care of the dog. Reading this, it sounds like she hit a rough patch and you jumped at the opportunity to give back the dog. It also sounds like you're one of those folks who doesn't really believe depression exists and are looking for something to end it instead of understanding that it can be a lifelong process. \n\nTry harder to understand what your daughter is going through instead of dismissing it with quotation marks and calling it an excuse.\n\nI could be wrong, but your phrasing is giving me \ud83d\udea9.", "YTA.

Did you know that there are places that specifically train dogs to be emotional support animals? If you picked it up from the shelter, it's GOING to have its own trauma and issues.

Get over it, clean it up, **remind** her, and don't reprimand her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou come across as the kind of dad who didn't change diapers when she was a baby because \"I've just been hard at work and I don't want to, and it's gross.\" When the wife had been at home all day, with no break at all, and had changed 7 diapers that day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I warned her twice that if she didn\u2019t start taking responsibility that the dog would be going back and she gave me excuses saying she was feeling depressed again.\n\n***Excuses?*** Depression doesn't need a reason, it doesn't always happen because of a specific event. Saying that she was coming up with \"Excuses\" sounds a lot to me, like a Dad who doesn't believe mental illness is an actual thing and she's being \"Over emotional\" or \"dramatic.\"  Yeah, okay she's 17 and almost a \"legal\" adult, but no one is a fully functioning adult at 18, even less so when mental illness is involved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I got fed up so one day when she went to school I loaded the dog in my truck and told the shelter he wasn\u2019t a good fit for us.\n\nSo ultimately, your daughter is dealing with her brain not being wired properly, and not responding the way it should.

Yeah, honestly I'd tell my dad he'd made my Depression worse if he did that to me.

Basically she doesn\u2019t want to try it again.\n\nI was pretty against bringing an animal into the home as my daughter can barely keep her room clean and remember to wash her dishes, much less take care of an animal. And I absolutely refused to do anything for the dog because I work long hours and didn\u2019t want to be picking up messes when I got home. My wife said I was being unfair and that this could be what my daughter needed to get back in good spirits.\n\nSo we got her a dog. We let her pick out from few select breeds, since certain breeds tend to need higher requirements for care (such as frequent grooming and other traits) and I was against getting some breeds just because of personal preference. \n\nThe dog was great at first and it got along with my daughter and wife greatly. Me not so much, but it could probably sense I didn\u2019t really like it either. But then it started getting out of its leash on walks, tearing up the couch and various other toys we bought it. My daughter started forgetting to let it out, so I\u2019d come home to find poop and pee all over the brand new carpet. \n\nI warned her twice that if she didn\u2019t start taking responsibility that the dog would be going back and she gave me excuses saying she was feeling depressed again.

You\u2019re not TA for bringing the dog to the shelter, but you are TA for every other part of this story.

Exercise? It sounds like you all just bought a dog thinking it would be some miracle perfectly behaved fix, but didn\u2019t think about the fact that this is a living animal with its own personality and real needs. Then you proceeded to get mad at it for being a dog. Your daughter should have stepped up from day 1. She wanted the dog and care is her responsibility, but I do think as a family you could have done more to prepare her for this, since it sounds like she\u2019s never had a dog before.", "YTA why get the dog to begin with?

I still managed to bring my dog outside to the nearest spot if grass or to walk around the block so my dog could pee or poop multiple times a day. Depression is not an excuse to neglect an animal. It sounds like you were the only responsible person in your household and even if you didn\u2019t like the dog much are also the only one wanting the best for the dog. As sad as it is the shelter is a better place for it than your home and you made the right decision.", "NTA.

Your wife appears to be less sceptical than you (and definitely me) and more likely to jump through whatever hoops your daughter says she requires to make her better - but the dog didn't help, did it? And she had zero interest in it once it started to need her attention, which is the opposite to the real benefit of an ESA, that is to give the sufferer a feeling of purpose and enable them to care for a creature which in turn will care for them. None of that happened here.\n\nIf your daughter is still struggling with depression and anxiety get her back to your doctor and have treatment and support arranged professionally.", "This.

There was no conversation about it, nor chance to say goodbye. When confronted about just taking our dog from us without warning, step-mom said it was best that way so there wouldn't be all the crying and drama. \n\nSo we provided her with a lot of crying and drama.", "Agree! NTA. \n\nBut also, as the parent you really need to push your daughter to try therapy again.

The Y T A responses are all blaming the father for not caring for the dog more himself/teaching his daughter to take care of the dog better but she's 17 for crying out loud- she'll be an adult next year and could have gone to the shelter herself at any time and started this same process. It sounds like they put in a ton of effort to select a good breed, purchase all needed toys/etc. and gave her all the tools to care for said dog and she just slacked off completely. From my perspective, her parents did everything they could to make her a responsible dog owner and she backslided completely. \n\nThat said, OP is YTA for letting his teenage daughter neglect her mental health. It was wrong of him to think depression could be solved with a shiny new pet. She needs to be made to go back to therapy, right now, because she's only going to be a minor under his care for a little while longer and she's neglecting her own health right now.", "OP, like the comment above I do agree that you were ultimately right to take the dog away. The dog deserves a better home than yours and at least you recognized that. But YTA for doing it while daughter was at school. But I also sense that you aren't taking her depression very seriously. You say she was making \"excuses\" about being depressed again. I don't think she is. She needs way more therapy than she's getting, and if she doesn't like one, time to insist that she find another one. She might need to be on medication. So I agree NTA on behalf of the dog. But YTA for seemingly dismissing her depression.", "My gut reaction was YTA. Then I thought about our cats. If no one was feeding them, cleaning up their litter, or giving them the attention they require, would that be a good environment for them? Clearly not, but yes it should have been discussed and not a surprise.", "The only thing I disagree with is the judgement she is an asshole for putting the dog in that situation and for not doing the work for finding a home that can provide the love and care the dog needs.\n\nSo many dogs end up in shelters because people like OP pick breeds based on \"preference\" if someone who \"refuses to do anything for the dog\" so they get it from a breeder then drop it off at a shelter when the dog they are neglecting acts like a neglected dog. \n\nIf you take on a pet you are responsible for giving that pet a good life and if you cannot then you are responsible for finding someone who can.", "[deleted]", "This is an awful reply.

It sounds like they bought a doodle from a breeder or a pet store.", "ESH (except for the dog). 1. You allowed your daughter to adopt a dog knowing that she likely was not responsible enough to properly care for and train said dog.  2. You basically set this situation up for failure by not providing the support she needed to be a responsible dog owner (such as requiring her to at least read up on dog care, and enrolling her and the dog in a training class, such as Canine Good Citizen or at least Basic Good Manners). 3. You pulled a real a-hole move by taking the dog back to the shelter behind everyone involved\u2019s back.

Meaning she can\u2019t walk/play with/let out the dog in that time. Of course she should\u2019ve been doing more when she was home but I feel she can only be blamed so much for things happening in the middle of the day. Dog inside when she leaves for school? Put him out. Maybe a little annoying but again she isn\u2019t home and can\u2019t do certain things during weekdays.

No matter how helpless I feel, my dog is actually helpless without me to care for her.", "Exactly. I have no doubt that the daughter is struggling, but part of me wonders if she was using her poor mental health as an excuse to get a pet.

At first I thought he was the asshole for just getting rid of the dog while she was gone without letting her say goodbye, but you're right these all sound like normal having a new dog hiccups.

Yeah it sucks for the pup to not be cleaned up after, but to already have a daughter with mental health issues, excite them over the dog, and then rip it away...not good at all.  I understand why he did it, but I'm sure this will only enhance her depression.  Whatever relationship he had with her will now be bruised.  \n\nIf I had a depressed child, I would do what I could to help improve the child's mental health.  YOU are the parent here.

When I first started experiencing depression, I was older than your daughter is now. I came home from college and I did everything I could to try and hide it because I didn't want to be a burden. When I couldn't help it and I'd break down crying, I'd be told I needed to try, and then it would just get swept aside. I was desperate for it to stop but I also felt like a waste of space and effort, and everyone kind of just assumed I was being moody and temperamental, and it made it hard to get help.

She asked for this pet and you took it away, so that likely emphasized that for her. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I think you were right to take it back to the shelter, because it needed a better home (and if it had been me, I would have been more depressed seeing the dog as one more creature I was failing). But taking it back and not following up with \"Let's try something else\" is the mistake. You have to emphasize loud and clear how much you love your daughter, how much you want to help, and then you have to do it again and again and again, because depression is a liar and it is *so* hard for her to hear that right now and to believe it. You have to say it, you have to be clear, and you have to follow it with action to match. Make sure she knows she's worth the effort. That you want to help her. That she's NOT a burden for needing help \u2014 it's effort, but you love her, and that's all there is to it.\n\nI know it can seem like banging your head against the wall.

But what you can do, what you need to do, is to be openly, actively, vocally present for her and to help guide her. Given choices, I'd panic because I couldn't choose; my head was too full of anxiety and what ifs. Having someone else outline a plan I can then agree or disagree with parts of helps SO much. So please, do the work and help her until she can do it too.

The second way is that she saw I functioned better if I had certain types of responsibilities. Taking care of my cat indeed did help me function better, I couldn't not clean his box or not give him food and water, he was dependent on me and deserved that. The idea of not being able to afford his food broke my heart, it helped remind me of why I was trying to hold it together at work and pass my college classes. He helped pull me from actively suicidal to functionally depressed. When I accidentally fell pregnant, he curled up on my belly every night and would purr and rumble.

That means \"signing her up for classes in how to care for and obedience train the dog\" (and making attending those a condition of owning the dog), and sitting down with her to come up with a schedule/routine for care (walking, feeding, playing, brushing, whatever).\n\nAgain, a 17 year old is capable of doing this, but I don't blame every 17 year old for not \\*already knowing\\* how best to do all these things.

I don't officially refer to my cat as an \"emotional support animal\" (I may be that for her, but I doubt it), but caring for her and the love and attention she gives me is incredibly helpful and I'm thankful for her every day.", "thats definitely part of it. i wouldnt call my dogs emotional support animals, but the fact that even on my worst days I need to take them for walks and feed them gets me out of bed", "I\u2019m my experience that is exactly what separates an ESA from a pet. It is easier to keep a routine when it\u2019s for someone else you care about, the by product of caring for an animal is all things that are good for a person. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like a doctor was consulted in this situation. ESAs are great, but they need to be prescribed because if a person is not in a place to care for the animal, it can actually exacerbate mental health issues (I won\u2019t even begin to go off on how this negligence towards a living being is wrong). In this parent\u2019s situation I would have made a deal that the daughter go back to therapy (and a doctor or psychiatrist if needed for medication) to skill build in anticipation of getting an ESA.", "I have a few friends with severe depression that say the biggest support their animal gives them is a reason to get up in the morning. They HAVE to get up, their animal needs to be fed and walked. \n\nPreface to this next bit: Please understand I\u2019m not comparing my child to an emotional support animal. I totally get it, because that\u2019s how it was when I went through some severe depression while my son was a toddler. Until I made it through the worst of it, the only think forcing me to function was making sure he was happy and cared for. It doesn\u2019t fix things, but it gets you through.", "ESAs are not service dogs. There is a huge gulf between the two. https://www.veterinarians.org/service-animal-vs-emotional-support-animal/", "No, those are service animals. Service animals are 'medical devices' and covered by most ADA type laws of countries. ESAs are just glorified pets. It is true pets can have a very positive impact on people in general, those with or without mental illness. I do a lot better with pets than without them psychologically. I don't need them but I'm happier with them. I didn't get some until I could care for them. A service dog would have to be permitted in a store but an ESA or any other pet wouldn't. \n\nStill the animal's welfare out ranks the person's wants or desires to have one. If someone can't take care of their pet (or service animal) alone or it won't be cared for by the household you don't have one.", "I think the only emotional support animals that would require vigorous training are the ones that specifically go to public places like hospitals or schools to lift people's spirits up and stuff - can't have those dogs causing havoc at those places!", "My cat was literally the only thing keeping me alive seven years ago - my family sucks, I didn't have friends, my job was BS, and I was severely depressed to the point of watching busses go by and wondering when I could \"accidentally trip\" and make it look like an accident.\n\nBut that little monster needed someone to come home and feed her and make sure she didn't end up back in a shelter, so I sucked it up and went home to her every day.\n\nShe's fourteen now, and queen of the house my wife and I share with our two dogs and second cat.", "I mean, it's a cat, she's there for the food. No offense dude, but if you were small and snack sized, she'd eat you. I love cats, but they just don't care about anything except getting food.", "So I\u2019m actually in the process of getting a service dog, and your comment prompted me to do some more research. It seems you\u2019re correct that the specific verbiage is \u201cif the animal is trained to perform tasks\u201d then it\u2019s a service animal. It seems a little murky to me as far as definitions go - because you for sure could train an ESA to do some tasks and that doesn\u2019t automatically make them a service dog. And then with things like PTSD, some people get ESAs and some people get service dogs. Feels like a lot of grey area.\n\nDoesn\u2019t affect my particular situation, as mine is 100% a service dog - but definitely an interesting read!", "Those would be Therapy dogs. Another category."]}
