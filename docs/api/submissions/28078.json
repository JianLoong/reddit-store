I asked her what are her symptoms from the allergies, she said runny eyes, runny nose, coughing and sneezing\u2026 I asked her why she always sniffs, she said because she has a runny nose. I asked, would it be better to blow it? She said she has a small amount of mucus and it\u2019s not enough to blow, so she sniffs\u2026 I left the conversation there, as I thought that was enough of a hint and I didn\u2019t want to push too far.\n\nToday the sniffing was again off the charts. Several sniffs a minute..I couldn\u2019t enjoy any of the meals together because I was so irritated by the sniffing.\n\nI went home via the pharmacy. Bought her Clarantyne and a box of tissues. I returned home and gave it straight to her. I thought the box of tissues might be a hint to blow her nose instead of sniff.\n\nWe sat down to have lunch and after I finished eating, I left the table because i couldn\u2019t stand the constant sniffing.\n\nI went to my room and googled if it was rude to ask someone to blow their nose instead of sniff.\nI\u2019m guessing I have misophonia. maybe it\u2019s confirmation bias, but all the threads reddit turned up showed me I\u2019m not\nthe only one who finds it annoying.\n\nSo I sent a message to her saying:\n\n\u201cHi <name>,\n\nI hope this doesn\u2019t come off as mean or insensitive, because I\u2019m sure it\u2019s annoying for you having constant allergies.. but could you please try blowing your nose instead of sniffing? It\u2019s a little gross to hear it at the table when we\u2019re eating and if I\u2019m being completely honest, I also find it very irritating to hear constant sniffing.\u201d\n\nShe did not respond. She sent a message to my wife saying if I\u2019m not comfortable living with her, she\u2019s not comfortable with me, thank you for everything, she\u2019s going to move out, it might take a couple of weeks but they will start looking. She also said she doesn\u2019t want to talk to me anymore, but she will be civil. This is all translated and best guess from my recollection of the translation.\n\nIn my mind, that is a very immature and childish reaction. It\u2019s a tantrum. Maybe I have been overly insensitive or hurtful in my message, but she needs to address me like a mature adult and have a conversation instead of crying to her sister.\n\nApparently I am the asshole because she has a medical condition and she can\u2019t help it, so I shouldn\u2019t have even said that or asked it.\n\nSo let me know, AITA?", "created_utc": 1696244617, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xtnqp/aita_for_asking_my_sil_to_try_blowing_her_nose/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

IMO, that is the mature thing to do, I wouldn\u2019t want to be living with someone that acts the way you do either.\n\nETA - you can be annoyed by the sniffling, but as someone who deals with allergies, sometimes there isn\u2019t much you can do. Meds don\u2019t always help and blowing your nose constantly can become painful.", "YTA\n\nBringing it up the first time? Fine. However she did explain that blowing her nose wouldn't help the problem. (I can confirm this. Usually it either does nothing or irritates the nose making the sniffing worse).\n\nBut you didn't stop. You ignored her answer, thinking you knew better.\n\nThe issue was brought up again with passive aggressive gift.\n\nThen again with your message.\n\nIt was clear you weren't going to stop and didn't respect her position so she has to remove herself from the situation.\n\nOh and its a joke to say \"she needs to address me like a mature adult and have a conversation\" because *that's what you should have done*. Are you kidding?! Lol dude...", "You said. You asked. She answered. Then you badgered and nagged and harped.\n\nYTA.\n\nYou already know you don't know what you're talking about, and Google won't turn you into a medical professional.\n\nAs someone with year long allergies (thanks, dust!), you can blow and *nothing comes out*. It's like there's a wall between the front of your nose, and the back. The issue is in the back, but it can't get out the front!\n\nFinally - it's just as gross and irritating to the person to whom it is happening. In fact - this will blow your (nose) mind: it's actually *worse*.", "YTA. I'm currently in the Midwest and it's allergy season. This is how it works. You admitted you know nothing about allergies so why did you assign yourself as the allergy doctor?", "I wasn't aware that there are people who DON'T experience allergies. Please tell me what it's like being God's favourite\n\nAllergies are the worst, you can blow your nose till your ear drums burst, it will not help. It's like a leaking tap, it doesn't matter that the tap is closed, it still drips. \n\nIt's annoying but there's only so much allergy medicine one can take.  I have allergies all year round and my dogs make it even worse, but I deal with it. It's not like she's going around trying to irritate you. Matter of fact, since YTA, hopefully she sneezes on you, tehehehe.", "YTA Another vote for the fact that blowing her nose wouldn\u2019t help at all, and she knows it, which means you were being a jerk. Honestly, what were you thinking? She enjoys sniffing? She\u2019s too lazy to blow her nose? When you put it like that, doesn\u2019t it sound implausible?\n\nSo, her presence makes you miserable enough that you\u2019re an aggressive jerk to her, and it\u2019s about something she can\u2019t change.

I take Claritin and Flonase and still sniff because allergies are so bad.", "You blame her for not being able to have a conversation while you are unable to have a conversation yourself. lol. projection much?\n\nYTA for for your inability to communicate with other people.", "Yta. I mean really. Yes sniffing is annoying and buying her Claratyne would have been thoughtful if it wasn\u2019t given with a massive dose of arrogant passive-aggression.\n\nAlso, nose blowing the number of times she was probably sniffling would have gotten on your poor little sensitive nerves.\n\nDid you consider that she was suffering about a gazillion times more than you did listening to it?", "YTA, you said it yourself, you don't know about allergies", "YTA.   \n\n\nShe said she has allergies. You don't get to decide if she takes meds, you don't get to decide what she does with her nose.   \n\n\nYou *can* decide to remove yourself. That's all you get to decide. Leave her alone.", "YTA. \n\nI have terrible allergies. Have seen doctors. Weirdly, none of them have suggested I \u201cjust trying blowing my nose.\u201d \n\nBecause that\u2019s literally not how it works.", "I have misophonia and allergies. YTA, blowing her nose would make it worse. I get it, some noises can be too much but you went fully passive agressive with not a single intention to understand her.", "YTA\n\nI'm sure she finds it very irritating to hear constant complaining and nagging. \n\nI also find it really hard to believe that constant nose blowing would be any less irritating. \n\n>I\u2019m guessing I have misophonia.\n\nThat's a *you* problem. Earplugs exist. Instead of repeatedly harassing her about a problem she can't do anything about, maybe you should solve your own.", "Downvote away, but NTA. She may be uncomfortable with her allergies or whatever, but she\u2019s taking no action to mitigate them. As someone with misophonia, it\u2019s difficult not to fixate on something like this. I say let her move out and good riddance tbh.", "Did\u2026did you seriously just ask someone with ALLERGIES and a stuffy nose to blow their nose, and get them cheep off the shelf medicine thinking it would magically solve the problem? Gee, I wonder why SHE didn\u2019t think of that YEARS ago when her allergies first arose! Oh wait\u2026 Not all allergy medications work for everyone. How did you make this far in life? YTA", "YTA, educate yourself on allergies. During allergy season its a nonstop faucet of snot and swollen sinuses, same if there is a trigger (if someone around me wears perfume for example, im in snifflefville)", "YTA. You admit you know nothing about having allergies but you refused to accept when she told you blowing her nose won't help. You've already talked to her, you made the passive aggressive move of buying her tissues and then you escalated to the text. I understand why she isn't comfortable around you anymore. You're basically harassing her about something she can't help.", "I also have misophonia. I have sat through some pretty painful dinners with cousins who chew with their mouths open, and experienced many other noises that are unpleasant to my ears. Like a coworker i shared office space with for 6 months and all i could hear was him munching on carrots the entire time. Dude was too fat and unfit to get up the stairs to the department he actually worked in, so my office was his disability accommodation. Who the eff was i to even think about complaining about his carrot sticks? No one, and i didn't.\n\nMisophonia is YOUR issue to deal with, not anyone else's. And yet you decided to make it your SIL's problem to deal with. YTA", "YTA. I wish she was the Petty Squad. I would have graciously accepted the (expensive, name brand) allergy pills and the (expensive, name brand) Kleenex tissues and then I would have proceeded to blow my nose every single time I wanted to sniffle. Trust and believe, goose honking every five seconds is worse than someone slurping air through their nose. And the pills? I wouldn't have taken them, oh no, that's my new fidget and I like shaky sounds and rattling noise \ud83d\ude01\n\nYou shouldn't get irritated at her for a natural bodily function and *allergies* don't equal *illness.* most people, especially in the Midwest, have really horrible allergies and don't take meds because, outside of a comfort issue, meds don't do anything for it.", "YTA Why the hell do you think you know more about a condition than the person who lives with it. I can guarantee you that constant nose blowing would be more annoying than sniffing. Not to mention more painful for her. Grow up.", "NTA. There are solutions to allergies and it\u2019s completely unnecessary to be annoying about it.", "NTA \n\nShe hasn't sought medical advice or done anything to mitigate her symptoms.\n\nI have a daughter with hay-fever and Allergies.   \n\nShe has tried multiple medication before she found something that works for her.    \n\nShe should at least try something before getting so offended about a reasonable ask.   \n\nI can understand how it can get very irritating.   \n\nIt's gross hearing someone sucking there snot up their nose constantly especially every few seconds.\n\nIt would drive me insane.", "YTA.\n\n>In my mind, that is a very immature and childish reaction.\n\nNot really. The way you kept bringing it up and leaving the table was immature.\n\n>Maybe I have been overly insensitive or hurtful in my message, but she needs to address me like a mature adult\n\nShe did. She told you it would not help it and you ignored her and sent her that message. She is being an adult by removing herself from the situation and making your life free of her sniffles, because she doesn't want to deal with your constant reminders of how much she bothers you by having allergies.\n\n>and have a conversation instead of crying to her sister.\n\nShe didn't cry to her sister. She thanked her sister for being kind and welcoming and said she would no longer interact with you, and she is already doing that. \n\nYou just didn't like her reaction because she made you the bad guy. Which is true in this case. You kept pushing and pushing for her to do what *you* wanted instead of what she knows, when she is the one having allergies.\n\nBut now you are feeling angry and acting like she is immature because your partner is angry at you for trying to control what her sister did to her body in your house.", "Did you EVER in your life have a cold? What happened to your nose after blowing it the 100th time on a day? Did it get sensitive to touching? Did it even hurt everytime you blew it after one or two days?\n\nImagine blowing your nose 10 times every minute for a month or so! By that time it would bleed on the outside, from the constant wiping with a tissue.\n\nYTA\n\nWhy would she try and talk to you?\n\nYou asked her why she sniffs. She told you why. You ask her, if blowing would be better. She told you NO. You bought her medication?!? and thought she didn't get the hint. YOU didn't get the hint! And even after that, you decided, that you would NOT talk to her directly, like an adult, but instead sent her a message! \n\nYou harrassed her for days because of something she couldn't change, even if she wanted.\n\nAnd now you are mad, that she did the ADULT thing and talked to her sister about leaving?", "YTA. She knows how to blow her nose. She's not a child. Her sniffing bothers her *waaay* more than it bothers you, misphonia or not. She doesn't need you to tell her how annoying to you her discomfort is and how she could simply fix an issue she's been coping with for probably her whole life.  \n  \nI know because I'm a chronic sniffer. Blowing my nose doesn't work. There's nothing to blow. It can be an autism stim or tourette's tick or post nasal drip. Or allergies that cause a tickle in the back of the nasal cavity and uncomfortable drip, but not enough that there's anything to blow out. Further, because it's chronic, even if blowing cleared the nose they would still have to blow just as often as they sniff. Which you would also find annoying and would make their nose raw and they'd have to constantly carry and discard tissues and wash their hands. People always say \"why don't you try blowing your nose\" and I give a big shocked expression and an exaggerated \"whaaat? you can *blow* a *nose*??? why did no one tell me this??? Thank you *sooo* much. this changes everything!\"", "I have allergies and just want to say that she could at least blow her nose before sitting down for mealtimes. It helps to a degree and you won't be sniffing away while people are eating. I get not wanting to blow your nose all the time because the skin under your nose gets irritated but mealtimes are different. Expecting her to never sniff is a bit much. I have near constant allergies at this time of year and I alternate between having a stuffy nose, runny nose, my throat itches, my eyes itch. Allergy medicine can only do so much. I can time taking the medication for certain situations, but it does not make all the problems go away 100% of the time.", "\n\nWhat country are you in, OP?

I blow my freaking nose (unless I\u2019ve run out of tissues because I blow my nose all the time). I was off medication while pregnant and breastfeeding and now I\u2019m blissfully back on and it\u2019s magical. I\u2019ll sniff instead of blow my nose if I\u2019m across the room from my box of tissues and it\u2019s annoying to go through tissues so fast when so little comes out, but constant sniffing is super annoying. \n\nThat being said family (who aren\u2019t AH\u2019s) should get more kindness. NAH, but you should apologize for making her uncomfortable in the way you presented your request and let her know that 1. The sound not her as a person is difficult for you to deal with and 2.

I thumb my nose at anyone belittling the misery of misophonia.", "YTA\n\nMisophonia sucks (if you actually have it). But it\u2019s your problem to deal with. You know what else sucks? Allergies. Buying her meds was alright, but bringing it up repeatedly after having the circumstances explained?

She can\u2019t help it; it\u2019s a huuggge dick move to harass someone over something they cannot help, especially a medical condition. Would you harass a visually impaired person using a cane because you hated the noise of it on the floor?", "Nta her reaction is over the top and it\u2019s probably for the best she move out if thats how she handles a simple conflict, hearing people sniffle and make throat noises sends me up the wall.", "NTA Maybe a bit insensitive but if she\u2019s that irritating and won\u2019t do anything about it let her move out.

I cannot stand being around people who snort or sniffle because enough exposure causes me to cry.  I don't understand YTA on here.  They don't understand how it could be torture to some and not to others. IT is like nails on a chalk board.   \n I eat by myself and I try to stay away from people in theatres and restaurants who do that.  I also get up from a seat if someone sits down and starts that next to me.  I walked outside a doctor's waiting room because of this.  She should try to blow her nose even with little mucus.  I find myself blowing my nose all day sometimes because I have same thing that she has.  Courtesy goes both ways because a total stranger will blow up at her and then she will have no room to be hurt.  I have to agree with some though that you should not have gotten those things.  That's a bit much.  I will offer tissues though.", "Seems like I am the only one who thinks like this but I genuinely think NTA.\n\nI grew up in a household in which my mother could not stand sniffing. \nSo we were constantly reminded not to do it.\n\nI can accept a bit of it. \nBut  I remind my BF to use a tissue if this is getting on my nerves.\n\nSo it might be the way I grew up that I can understand your complains.", "YTA. she can\u2019t help it and she already said that blowing her nose wouldn\u2019t work. and saying she was throwing a \u201ctantrum\u201d when you literally flipped out over sniffing is insensitive.", "YTA. She has spent her whole life living in that body. Why would you think you know better than her if blowing is better than sniffing for her runny nose?", "YTA - OP, I have a problem with sniffing specifically too. Everything you describe in your post sounds absolutely maddening and would've reduced me to tears of misophonia-fueled rage (and I'm *not* an easy crier). My poor husband deals with my constant begging/sniping at him knock it off when his allergies flare up, but ultimately it IS my problem to deal with, just as this is yours. I'm gonna go against the grain a little and say there's nothing wrong with politely asking if they can tone it down a little (sometimes people just sniff constantly without even being aware of it, my dear MIL who I love very much being a prime example lol) but once is enough, you asked, she answered, let it go and leave the table with an apology if it bothers you that much.\n\nAlso, if it's merely mildly irritating or distracting and not, say, causing you to retreat to the bathroom to keep from exploding in tears/fury in front of them, you probably don't have misophonia. But I'll admit I'm not an expert.", "Hi OP,\n\nI have misophonia, and whilst I doubt how you've gone about diagnosing yourself- just let me say-\n\nMy triggers are the sound of people eating so I quite simply leave the room or put on soundproof headphones when they eat- because it is my problem, not theirs. Telling her to just 'stop sniffing' when she has allergies is utterly ridiculous. YTA", "YTA. I get it. Its annoying. But as you said, its even more annoying for her to have a blocked nose.\n\nI dont have any (diagnosed) allergies, but my nose is perpetually congested. Short of the few times ive accidentally sniffed vinegar or something along those lines, I have not had clear nasal passages since i was a child. I get that its infuriating to hear me sniff, but theres literally nothing i can do. Just blowing my nose doesnt help, because theres not actually that much snot. The blockage- and this will almost definitely apply to your SIL too- is because of the nasal passage being inflamed. Blowing actually makes that *worse*. \n\nYTA because, however annoying it might be, you do not know her medical history, and you dont get to quiz her about it. Asking once if she cant blow her nose? Fine. Passive aggressively giving her a box of tissues? Leaving the table? Borderline. Asking *again*, despite her explaining that it doesnt help, because you\u2019ve just *decided* that you think it should? That makes you TA.\n\nSo does claiming she\u2019s throwing a tantrum in her response. She\u2019s literally just existing, and you are having a go at her and complaining to her about how annoying it is *when she cant fix it*. She has *told* you that, and you keep pushing it. She has every right to feel uncomfortable around you, because now she has to be aware of how much she\u2019s irritating you every time she breathes in your vicinity. She also has every right to chose to leave, given that there is quite literally no other option for her that\u2019ll make you happy. \n\n>> she needs to address me like a mature adult and have a conversation instead of crying to her sister.\n\nYou mean like she did the first time, when she answered your questions and explained why blowing her nose wouldn\u2019t work?\n\nOr do you mean \u2018mature conversation\u2019 like asking if she\u2019s tried blowing her nose and hoping she takes the hint? Or \u2018mature conversation\u2019 like passively aggressively handing her a box of tissues? Or like leaving the dinner table the second you\u2019re done eating because she irritates you so much? Or like repeating your suggestion that she has already told you wont work because you don\u2019t want to communicate about actual options?", "my dad has really bad sinus issues. pretty much constantly impacted by whatever allergies are prominent all year round; so it is possible. he\u2019s done everything even a sinus surgery that has since reverted back to business as usual; having empathy can go a long way and it seems you don\u2019t. YTA for hounding her to the point of making her so uncomfortable that she no longer wants to have a relationship with you.", "YTA - but you can make it right. Maybe apologise, and use it as an exercise in learning tolerance. If it helps, think back to those points in the last few years when we couldn\u2019t spend time with family, even if we wanted to. \n\nThere\u2019s an old meditation saying that\u2019s something like \u2018what we place our attention on grows lively\u2019 (someone else will remember this better than me) - actively choose to focus your mind on something in the experience that you enjoy, rather than doubling down in your mind about how annoying she is. It sounds like you\u2019re kind of torturing yourself.\n\nIf you need to talk to someone about something sensitive, it\u2019s more likely to go okay if you actually speak to them in person, with kindness, and give them the benefit of the doubt. If you text it may come across in a different tone to the one intended - though in this case you sound like you\u2019re assuming she\u2019s uncivilised, so maybe it came across in exactly the way you intended? \n\nIt seems a bit disingenuous to be surprised you\u2019ve hurt her feelings. You\u2019ve said you don\u2019t want to be mean but used words like \u2018gross\u2019 and \u2018irritating\u2019, and you\u2019re interpreting her hurt as a \u2018tantrum\u2019. Could you try making some more respectful assumptions about her experience - and maybe just lightening up a bit? Life\u2019s too short.\n\nEdited to add: I have someone in my family who sniffs a lot (though habitually rather than due to allergy), so I think I do get what you\u2019re wrestling with. I\u2019d say it is possible to keep your composure and equilibrium. Can you problem-solve with your partner? It must be hard for them being in the middle of this. Good luck!", "NAH\nBecause it's AWFUL to listen to somebody sniffing. But as somebody who has terrible allergies and literally can't do anything about it, I assure you it's far more awful for me to go through the allergies.  There isn't a second of my day I'm not suffering.", "YTA.  Must be nice not having sinus problems.", "Yta she literally told you why she doesn't blow her nose. And you went 'well, clearly *I* know better than this person whose body it actually is!'", "YTA. If you have not experienced allergies you do not understand. Blowing your nose may help for about 10 seconds and then you\u2019re back to sniffing.  And if you are constantly blowing your nose you start to rub your nose raw and then are in constant pain.", "You're between a rock and a hard place here. YTA for harping on her when she can't or won't fix the issue but NTA for having an intolerance for hearing constant sniffing especially at the dinner table! I have allergies, sometimes there isn't anything substantial to blow out but I don't go around sniffing constantly, that genuinely is disgusting and counter productive because then you swallow the mucous and inevitably cough it back up.", "Medical condition? You asked her very nicely and she said nothing about a medical condition. \n\nESH.

I have hay-fever so I understand the irritation, but I'd rather blow a little bit than sniff constantly and sniffing mucus often leads to infection and if its due to a cold instead of allergies then it prolonged the infection.

I also have a distinct feeling that if she could blow her nose, you\u2019d criticize her for making that noise. Being annoyed at a sound also doesn\u2019t automatically mean you have misophonia.

I asked her what are her symptoms from the allergies, she said runny eyes, runny nose, coughing and sneezing\u2026 I asked her why she always sniffs, she said because she has a runny nose. I asked, would it be better to blow it? She said she has a small amount of mucus and it\u2019s not enough to blow, so she sniffs\u2026 I left the conversation there, as I thought that was enough of a hint and I didn\u2019t want to push too far.\n\nToday the sniffing was again off the charts. Several sniffs a minute..I couldn\u2019t enjoy any of the meals together because I was so irritated by the sniffing.\n\nI went home via the pharmacy. Bought her Clarantyne and a box of tissues. I returned home and gave it straight to her. I thought the box of tissues might be a hint to blow her nose instead of sniff.\n\nWe sat down to have lunch and after I finished eating, I left the table because i couldn\u2019t stand the constant sniffing.\n\nI went to my room and googled if it was rude to ask someone to blow their nose instead of sniff.\nI\u2019m guessing I have misophonia. maybe it\u2019s confirmation bias, but all the threads reddit turned up showed me I\u2019m not\nthe only one who finds it annoying.\n\nSo I sent a message to her saying:\n\n\u201cHi <name>,\n\nI hope this doesn\u2019t come off as mean or insensitive, because I\u2019m sure it\u2019s annoying for you having constant allergies.. but could you please try blowing your nose instead of sniffing? It\u2019s a little gross to hear it at the table when we\u2019re eating and if I\u2019m being completely honest, I also find it very irritating to hear constant sniffing.\u201d\n\nShe did not respond. She sent a message to my wife saying if I\u2019m not comfortable living with her, she\u2019s not comfortable with me, thank you for everything, she\u2019s going to move out, it might take a couple of weeks but they will start looking. She also said she doesn\u2019t want to talk to me anymore, but she will be civil. This is all translated and best guess from my recollection of the translation.\n\nIn my mind, that is a very immature and childish reaction. It\u2019s a tantrum. Maybe I have been overly insensitive or hurtful in my message, but she needs to address me like a mature adult and have a conversation instead of crying to her sister.\n\nApparently I am the asshole because she has a medical condition and she can\u2019t help it, so I shouldn\u2019t have even said that or asked it.\n\nSo let me know, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I tried using cloth handkerchiefs which was better, but the constant blowing left me with red raw and cracked skin all round my nostrils. It was really painful.\n\nThats without going into everything else about it - feeling like I had stinging nettles up my nose, eyes red and streaming all the time, constant sneezing and runny nose, and being doped up on antihistamines throughout all my school and college exams.\n\nI think people who have never had it think it\u2019s just a sniffle. I am so, so grateful it stopped for me in my mid twenties, it was miserable.

It\u2019s totally more irritating for you than the person actually having to deal with the allergies. Poor, poor you. \n\nI had severe allergies for years. I tried all of the medicines.

As if people struggling with these issues would never have heard of this shit or just actively chose not to do it because they enjoy suffering. It's so dumb. Lol.\n\nETA: OP, as someone with allergies and misophonia, YTA. If you actually do have misophonia, you should look into Loop ear plugs.
