Please, call me when your apartment is clean so I can go. \n\nBoyfriend: Fair enough. \n\nIt turns out he didn\u2019t call me.\n\nMore information: \n\nHe said he can\u2019t afford a maid. \n\nThe thing is: he says my requirements are not fair since his apartment is the only place we can meet privately and do the things couples do. \n\nHe pays the rent, the food we eat, things the dog needs, etc (I\u2019m 100% dedicated to college, so I don\u2019t have an income). \n\nSo, sometimes I feel guilty for not helping him clean his dirt.\n\n\nAbout the level of \u201cclean\u201d: I\u2019m ok to go if the kitchen is relatively clean: not a lot of dirty dishes, clean floor and no rotten food in the pans. Also, no dirty clothes all around the house, specially on the table we eat. I don\u2019t care if the floor is a little bit dirty and not even the bathroom. I\u2019m usually the one who cleans his bathroom since I\u2019m very good at it (fast and effective).\n\nI removed the \u201c100%\u201d from the question, because of course it\u2019s not reasonable and I don\u2019t expect perfection. \n\nAITA for not going to my boyfriend\u2019s apartment until it\u2019s clean? \n\nThanks for the attention!", "created_utc": 1693669144, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1685n5f/aita_for_only_going_to_my_boyfriends_apartment_if/", "score": 112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She recommends things like while you're brushing your teeth wipe the sink out right away, and if you spend 5 minutes every morning wiping up your bathroom, or do the dishes every night before you go to bed then none of that stuff builds up and you don't need a whole cleaning day because you're doing 5 minutes here in 5 minutes there.\n\nProblem here is your boyfriend is lazy and expects you to pick up the slack which isn't right.

If it's make sure there's not filth lying around, unwashed dishes piling up, clothes all over, totally reasonable.

Paying for dates doesn't buy you a maid. \n\nOP cleans up after himself in the apartment. That's all that GUESTS should be doing. They should not be cleaning your dirty laundry or cleaning your floor. OP is not creating that mess. He is not responsible for it.", "But baaaabe I'm too tired to take my dirty laundry off the kitchen table so we can eat!", "You are correct.", "Hey op, if his level of hygiene of his home is low than I'd be concerned about his body and oral  hygiene, especially if you guys are intimate. Folks forget bad oral care can affect other body stuff it can come in contact with. Sorry if this is a weird comment.", "Paying for what? The only thing I see that he pays for her is the food they eat. Everything else he has to pay for anyway because it's his apartment... She does not live there! \n\nAlso he got into a relationship with somebody that wasn't working so he can't exactly be pissy about paying for food now. And it's not really fair for him to expect her to earn her keep so to speak by cleaning for him.", "No one said he should be his maid or clean his entire apartment by himself. Please stop making assumptions. His partner is asking for help, and I just think the response OP gave was fairly heartless. There\u2019s should be no issue in helping out your partner, if your boyfriend or girlfriend was moving somewhere and asked you for help, would you just say no because now you think you\u2019re a just a mover? Just set some boundaries and inform them with what you are okay with helping them out with. Helping your partner out when they are in a tough spot doesn\u2019t make you their employee, it just makes you a compassionate partner.", "Reading this made me think of Spaced:-\n\nMake sure to wash your sheets! And your penis!", "Both OP and boyfriend are male", "and hands/ take care of your nails\n\nsome dudes have GROSS fingernails :/", "Omg yes, so glad you made this reference!", "Whoops! You know I did know that but then when I replied to that other comment I sort of lost what thread I was on after they referred to her."]}
