We used my egg and my wife carried the baby, so it feels like both of us. My wife was adopted. She does not have or know of any genetic relatives. Before doing IVF with my egg, we had long conversations about how this meant she would not have a genetically-related child. She said she just wanted to be pregnant and didn't care about genetics and liked the idea of my egg.\n\nYesterday, our daughter (8months) took her first steps. We sent the video to my mom and my mom said, \"Junior (my name)\" because I also walked young. My wife thought this was insensitive because she (my wife) is not genetically related to our daughter. I told my wife the comment did not seem objectively insensitive but I could see it was insensitive to her. I replied to the text from my mom with a general comment about how our daughter will have traits from both me and my wife.\n\nAITA? Is my mom the asshole for making a comment about me being genetically-related to my daughter even though my wife is not? This will continue to come up throughout our lives, so curious to know your opinions.

Centre the child here - there is absolutely no harm in pointing out biological similarities and it is not an affront to your wife. This sounds like a normal thing for a grandmother to say - she didn\u2019t know your wife as a baby so this would trigger no memories or comparisons about her. \n\nYour wife needs to stop centering herself in this situation.", "NAH, your wife is being a little over sensitive, your child was exhibiting a trait similar to you and your mother commented on it, in the future there will no doubt be traits that come through from your wife that will be commented on by others. This happens with children that are biologically related to both parents as well, I don't think there was anything malicious meant in pointing out the baby was like you in that moment.", "Your daughter is not going to have your wife's eyes. Nor any of your wife's genetic traits.\n\nI don't see your mother's comment as being about the genetic heritage of the child. She's just proud of her granddaughter walking early. (The other g.m. can (does?) take pride that her granddaughter is walking early because her daughter (your wife) is such a nurturing mom.)\n\nNAH.\n\nIn the years to come, your mom can take the \"nature\" side and your MIL can take the \"nurture\" side of that old argument. Unless someone has strong opinions about nurture vs. nature, both grandmothers will be happy.", "I'm going with NAH.\n\nYou meant the comment in a different context than how your wife interpreted it, but I can also see where she's coming from. Perhaps she's a bit more bothered by not having a genetic relation to the baby than she initially said, or maybe it was something that developed over time. Either way, I don't think either of you are at fault.", "NAH. Mom wasn\u2019t insensitive. Perfectly natural comment because you walked early too. Your wife feels a bit excluded but hopefully after considering the comment, she will get over that. Your baby will get things from both of you.  Kids emulate their parents. It\u2019s not all about genetics. Not even sort of. She\u2019ll emulate you and your wife as she grows because you are her parents.", "NAH from what I can tell. My parents and my wife's parents always point out how our kids resemble or behave like we did. Neither of us takes offense, it's a grandparent thing. Your child will adopt traits of your spouse through behavior as much as genetics.", "NAH. Even a non-biologically related kid (or a niece or nephew) would get the \"mini you\" or \"junior you\" comment for exhibiting a trait of yours. It is likely to happen also with your wife, as the child mimics what she sees. Your wife did overreact, but as long as it's just feels and she discusses it with you, that's what you have to do as parents to work through things. A reply wasn't really needed, but you could tell your mom privately to be sensitive about issues that may emphasize genetics.", "ESH not your mom tho. You do for just keeping the peace instead of pointing out to your wife this isn\u2019t about her. Your wife needs to seek some therapy over her insecurity over this.\n\nYour mom is naturally going to see you in your children. Further the \u201ctraits from both of us\u201d is kinda nonsense. The baby will learn behaviors from your wife but will not have her traits, those are from genetics.", "NAH \n\nIn my experience, grandparents always see their own children in their grand babies. Like, honestly if you brought in someone else\u2019s baby and told them it was yours they\u2019d be like OF COURSE THEYRE JUST LIKE YOU. Grandparents, good ones at least, are just nuts for their grandkids and it makes them reminiscent of your childhood as well.\n\nI can see how this is a sensitive subject for your wife. I also don\u2019t think your mom was at all thinking about biology.\n\nYour wife has to become comfortable with the situation. She is EVERY BIT a mother, but she may need some counseling to help her fully allow herself to accept that fact and not worry about the genetics", "NTA, but I appreciate you being sensitive to your wife\u2019s concerns. Your mom is NTA either. My wife and I adopted (both women), and people would say at times how our daughter was more like one of us, despite everyone knowing there was no genetic component. \n\nI\u2019ve had plenty of friends in your exact situation. My advice is to keep open communication and when legit, point out characteristics of your child that mimic your wife. Trust me, there will be many. Just don\u2019t overdo it. That will just seem like you are patronizing her and might get annoying.", "We make comments about how one of our cats \"takes after his father\" or is \"just like his mom\" and neither one of us is genetically related to either cat! I think this is just a thing you say and part of building a family. I understand how your wife may feel sensitive about it but it's 100% not about her.", "I think your wife is overly sensitive. Sometimes we end up being the vessel to bring for our partner's mini me. She is probably realizing she should of used her own egg if it means so much to see herself in her child", "I don't necessarily think she (your mother) is the A here, I think she (your mother) was just emotional and reacted a bit thoughtlessly, which you made sure to sternly correct. If more things like this happen in the future, then have a more serious talk with her. This may very well have just been a one time thing.\n\nFor now, at least, NAH", "Your wife shouldn\u2019t have agreed to this if she was going to be this sensitive. The child will naturally have some of your traits\u2014it\u2019s your biological child.", "NTA. You\u2019re the only parent with a genetic tie to your child, but the kid is going to take after both of you because you\u2019ll both be raising her. When it comes to baby stuff, your parents are going to point out similarities to you because they knew you as a baby. But as she gets older and starts learning from you both, there will be opportunities to call her a \u201cmini\u201d each of you.", "NTA. And your mother isn't either, it's silly to pretend there's no genetic connection between you.", "Nature vs nurture \nMy current husband came into my and my kids life 13 years ago. My daughter was 8 and son 15. \nMy daughter is his daughter and OMG she is just like him in very many ways. Attitude and sarcasm and she is hilarious. \nYou are NTA and your child will pick up traits from both of you. \ud83d\udc99", "NAH\n\nThat's a generic and normal comment along the lines of \"she has your nose\" or \"he gets that from your family\",  etc.\n\nUnless your mom has a habit of excluding your wife? Going forward,  be aware of the possibility,  for your wife's sake and the baby's sake, because even the best intentioned of people can have unintentional biases.", "NAH.  A very different dynamic, but the Saltzmann sisters of the show Legacies take after their different moms.  One is more like bio-mom, while the other is more like gestational mom.\n\nUnless there is considerable friction between your mom and wife, your mom was probably well-intentioned.  Your wife might still be recovering from the hormonal toll of pregnancy, and could be feeling regret at not providing the egg as well.  If you're open to more children, and if your own health doesn't preclude carrying, talk about a reversal of roles for baby #2.", "Can\u2019t second this enough. There will be comments forever - \u201cSusie has your eyes!\u201d \u201cGood at basketball, just like her mama!\u201d It\u2019s not about her other mom being any less her mother, just about noticing similarities. If she\u2019s more like non-bio mom, there will probably be nature vs nurture comments, too - \u201cShe sure didn\u2019t get her math grades from you! Must be Mama2\u2019s influence!\u201d You can\u2019t let it get to you.", "Nah-  you mum only knew you as a little girl, so she is only ever going to see you in her grand daughter I\u2019m afraid-  that\u2019s not a comment on genetics and will be annoying for any parent when a mil/fil says they such a lil op..", "We joke that our one dog definitely got his long legs and anxiety from my side of the family.   It's good to know we aren't alone in saying silly things like this! \ud83d\ude1c", "We joke that our one dog definitely got his long legs and anxiety from my side of the family.   It's good to know we aren't alone in saying silly things like this! \ud83d\ude1c", "My mom constantly comments on how much my kids look like my husband. So, no.", "Your wife is an asshole. It's really sad you felt the need to ask.", "ESH except your mom. I appreciate that you\u2019re trying to look after your wife\u2019s feelings. But your response to your mom is complete nonsense and it\u2019s weird of you to even think she might be an asshole. Your wife is overly sensitive.", "NTA I love how you did not agree with your wife but were still sensitive about her feelings. She initially said the genetics wouldn\u2019t be a factor and now she\u2019s found out differently. But 18 years is a loong time to tiptoe around her about it. I got constantly told my kids looked nothing like me. (It was true) Hopefully she can get over her sensitivity.", "NTA \n\nYour mum has watched you grow and has pointed out a similarity. Something that most grandparents would do. From what you said, do not think your mum had any malicious intent.\n\nAs your little one grows, she will naturally mimic some of your wife's manorisms, etc. When these happen, I'm sure she will be over joyed. I have my step dad, who raised me from 4 years old. The number of times I get told I've done something the same as him or we have pulled the same face at the same time. None of this I realise in the moment because as I child, I subconsciously learnt loads from him. \n\nI do think your wife might benefit from some therapy or maybe finding a support group for other same sex couples in this situation. Having other parents in the same situation may help her sort through her emotions.", "NTA. My best friend\u2019s older child is adopted. I still tell her all the time that Kiddo is her twin because I see so many similarities between them.", "NTA. Mom of 3 here. My mother would make same comments when my children were little. I\u2019m married to the bio-dad. We physically lived near her and not his family. He never took offense that his children weren\u2019t \u201clike\u201d him from such comments. It is absolutely normal and appropriate for family members to make comments about milestones.   I don\u2019t believe relatives have any ill intent talking about milestones and how comments favor one parent over the other. This is what normally happens when a baby is very young until they become toddler.   \n\nBy toddler stage, early preschooler years, nurture will take over!  When babies start becoming \u201clittle people\u201d, the thrill of milestones is done and personalities start coming out!  Your child will soon hate broccoli just like your wife, laugh at silly jokes just like your wife, make an angry face just like your wife, sachet across the room just like your wife\u2026as your baby is only 8mo, that might seem forever away but will be here sooner than you think and your wife will forget all about this.  Until then, remind your wife love makes a happy, healthy baby-not genetics!  \n\nA healthy, happy baby is the only thing that should be focused on!!  And the ABSOLUTE JOY a baby brings!!! Congratulations!!!!", "I case see howbypur wife could be sensitive to the comment but gentle YTA, your mom didn't say it on purpose. You're being too harsh on your mom.", "Nah every grandparent will attribute traits to their own child regardless of the biology. It\u2019s just how it is", "NTA, your wife is being overly sensitive and it sounds like she has insecurities that stem from not having a genetic child. That however was a choice she made. She should not be upset with someone commenting that your child takes after you.", "Very soft YTA. I'm the non biological mother of our child and my wife carried the child too. While I don't love my child any less,  there are various circumstances where I will get a soft feeling of ... wistfulness? that the child is not genetically mine. I don't think that will ever go away, although kiddo clearly has some of my traits and habits and i wouldn't change them in any way. As the bio parent, keep that in mind. It's not something I ever thought about until it happened, and unlike some people are suggesting here, is not necessarily worthy of therapy. Just be aware that you both have different perspectives.", "It depends.  Not enough INFO to tell.\n\nIs your mom generally supportive and understanding, treating your wife like an equal parent and with respect?  Then your wife might just be a bit sensitive on this and if so, your mom would probably want to know so she doesn't inadvertently hurt her in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, is your mom a bit disapproving, acts like it's your child and her grandchild without as much respect for your wife?  If so, your wife is right to call this out.\n\nAs your mom's daughter you may have a hard time seeing the same things your wife or a stranger would.  I remember when my mother in law would come to visit when my kids were young.  My husband wouldn't take time off work, so I'd end up being the one to \"entertain\" her and she would spend most of the day making passive aggressive comments about all I was doing wrong.  My day started at 5 am, I'd work out then get the kids ready, drive them to different schools and return home at 9 am where I'd sit for 20 minutes and finally eat my breakfast while reading the Wall Street Journal before going to work.  My mother in law would stare at me making huffing noises and say things like \"isn't it lovely you have so much free time to sit and read the paper all day!\"  We lived in hot climates and when I'd make a main dish salad for dinner she'd exclaim how my children must be hungry because nobody had fed them a \"proper meal\" (since it wasn't hot and mainly meat.). Of course nothing like this was ever said to my husband, her favorite child and a man who couldn't possibly be expected to participate in any way in child rearing.  And when I'd tell him I didn't want to spend 3 weeks with her criticizing my every move, he honestly couldn't see that she was at all critical.  She'd never said a harsh thing to him and when I quoted what she'd said, he'd insist she was just trying to be helpful.  So... you may not be seeing the things your mother says in the same way your wife sees them.", "Perhaps it will help your wife to know that the same exact situation happens to biological parents. If one were to ask my in-laws, my son is a perfect clone of his father. My egg, my pregnancy, my childbirth\u2026and dad gets all the recognition.  Baby\u2019s grandma would have made the comment no matter the circumstances, I suspect. NAH.", "I\u2019m a mom to a genetic child and an adopted child. The one who is not genetically mine has been with me since he was two. I make comments about both my kids being like me and I don\u2019t mean anything by it either way. I can see why this might be a little hurtful to your wife but the person making the comment probably didn\u2019t mean anything by it. As the child gets older people might say stuff like that not thinking and your wife is gonna have to figure out how to deal with it.", "Nah. But she does need to realize, although yes, your child will gain personality and behavior traits from her, the child will never have genetic traits. Better learn now than later", "Nah.Yeah no it's gonna come up because the baby is going to take after you genetically but the baby will pick up on both of your mannerisms and take after your wife that way. You'll start noticing it a more in coming months. Also there's no reason for your wife to be sensitive about genetics she's raising her baby with you she's babies mumma too. Baby doesn't and won't know the difference unless it's made an issue until they're older and by then won't care cause she's mum.", "NAH. Your mom can only comment on things she knows you did as a child, not what your wife was like as a child (because she wouldn't know those things). But also, didn't they discover that the DNA of who carried the pregnancy is also present in the child besides the egg and sperm donors? I believe that means our daughter will share at least a small amount of your wife's DNA, if that helps anything.", "NAH. I'm adopted, and I've met my biological mom and her daughters (my half sisters). I can confidently tell you that nature and nuture make two halves of a whole. I have traits and mannerisms from my (adoptive) parents and family, as well as traits and mannerisms I share with my biological siblings. People used to tell us how much my twin and I look like our (adoptive) mom and aunt, and then meeting our half sisters lead to some very weird deja vu style moments. Your child will absolutely take after your wife in certain aspects. \n\nIt's OK if your wife has weird sensitivity or insecurities around this, even if she was OK with it in the beginning. Until my 30s my mom had this insecurity that when we met bio mom, we would click and run off into the sunset with bio family. Unfounded fear, but insecurities are like that. Make an effort to point out \"they got that from you\" moments. Be gentle and ensure she feels loved and valued and all will be well.", "NTA.  Your child will not have physical traits from the both of you.  They can develop habits and interests from the both of you, but physical traits are just not something possible.  Your wife is sensitive to this and it\u2019s something to watch for\u2026but she\u2019s over doing it. Your mom is going to see similarities, all grandparents do, and it seems they all like to bring it up.  She\u2019s afraid of being considered a \u201clesser parent\u201d.  If it\u2019s starting this early with this generic a comment, maybe see if counseling to help her deal before it impacts you and your daughter too.", "NTA. Your wife is being a little over-sensitive. \n\nNeither my husband or I are biologically related to either of our kids. They are half sisters adopted from foster care because we couldn't \"make our own\" in any way. There are comparisons made between us and the kids all the time. Early on, it was a little hard to hear because of the feelings of inadequacy, but it gets easier.\n\nMy favorite interaction was with some older ladies at Taco Bell. My 2yo and I were having lunch, and they came over and one of their comments was something like, \"She looks just like you.\" This was totally hilarious because I'm just about as Hispanic looking as it gets, and my daughter was a light skinned, very light blond with intense blue eyes. \n\nIt's not wrong for you to let your mom know that your wife is having issues with those kinds of comments. It's also not totally wrong for your wife to have those feelings, but it is something she needs to work to deal with. It's also not wrong for people to make those kinds of comments/comparisons. They're not digs at the genetically unrelated parent. Unless someone specifically says something like \"it's because the kid isn't related to you,\" they're not commenting on genetics at all.just", "YTA for telling any of your relatives whose egg it was.\n\nJunior <your name> was over stepping and wrong of your mom and she must not do it again \n\nYour mom was sidelining your partner as if the baby is yours and your partner is not an equal parent", "I agree. I don\u2019t think this is unique to your situation. Many grandparents make this kind of observation regardless of the biological relationships involved. My MIL is constantly comparing my sons to her sons. It kinda drives me nuts but whatever. But she ALSO frequently compares my sons to her daughter who is adopted and not biologically related. \u201cOh I remember when Mary did that! Mary was always (fill in the blank) at that age too!\u201d This kind of comment happens in all types of familiar relationships. \n\nNAH. I think your wife is probably a bit sensitive about it which is completely fine. But I don\u2019t think anyone did anything wrong here.", "\u201cMore things like this\u201d - would you elaborate? Saying you had the same hair colour as a baby, or she has your grandfathers eyes or whatever is incredibly normal things to talk about. And it\u2019s facts.

It may very well happen to OP's wife down the line.", "My grandmother often refers to my much younger cousin as a \u201clittle [aunt\u2019s name]\u201d even though my aunt used an egg donor (and this is common knowledge in the family)", "There's that, but there's also the fact that some of what we \"inhereit\" from our parents is observed and learned rather than genetic. I point at other cars when I'm driving and I don't want them to pull out ahead of me. It's silly and useless, but it's something I grew up watching my mom do. I have several adopted relatives and they all have body language or behaviors that mimic one or the other of their (non-bio) parents. This kid will too.", "This is true - children tend to pick up their parents\u2019 expressions and mannerisms and I bet there will be a hundred things that she does that are strongly reminiscent of her carrying mom, as well as some traits reminiscent of her biological mom.", "My mil showed me old family pics recently and for a second all I saw was my child. It wasn't it was his father. But holy wow ypu could put the two baby pics side by side and it's a little clone. Now he opens his mouth and there I am. Plus he has my toes."]}
