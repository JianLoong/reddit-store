{"id": 29853, "submission_id": "17if6b9", "title": "AITA - comment about genetically-related child to non genetically-related mom", "selftext": "My wife (39F) and I (37F) have a baby through IVF. We used my egg and my wife carried the baby, so it feels like both of us. My wife was adopted. She does not have or know of any genetic relatives. Before doing IVF with my egg, we had long conversations about how this meant she would not have a genetically-related child. She said she just wanted to be pregnant and didn't care about genetics and liked the idea of my egg.\n\nYesterday, our daughter (8months) took her first steps. We sent the video to my mom and my mom said, \"Junior (my name)\" because I also walked young. My wife thought this was insensitive because she (my wife) is not genetically related to our daughter. I told my wife the comment did not seem objectively insensitive but I could see it was insensitive to her. I replied to the text from my mom with a general comment about how our daughter will have traits from both me and my wife.\n\nAITA? Is my mom the asshole for making a comment about me being genetically-related to my daughter even though my wife is not? This will continue to come up throughout our lives, so curious to know your opinions.

Centre the child here - there is absolutely no harm in pointing out biological similarities and it is not an affront to your wife. This sounds like a normal thing for a grandmother to say - she didn\u2019t know your wife as a baby so this would trigger no memories or comparisons about her. \n\nYour wife needs to stop centering herself in this situation.", "NAH, your wife is being a little over sensitive, your child was exhibiting a trait similar to you and your mother commented on it, in the future there will no doubt be traits that come through from your wife that will be commented on by others. This happens with children that are biologically related to both parents as well, I don't think there was anything malicious meant in pointing out the baby was like you in that moment.", "Your daughter is not going to have your wife's eyes. Nor any of your wife's genetic traits.\n\nI don't see your mother's comment as being about the genetic heritage of the child. She's just proud of her granddaughter walking early. (The other g.m. can (does?) take pride that her granddaughter is walking early because her daughter (your wife) is such a nurturing mom.)\n\nNAH.\n\nIn the years to come, your mom can take the \"nature\" side and your MIL can take the \"nurture\" side of that old argument. Unless someone has strong opinions about nurture vs. nature, both grandmothers will be happy.", "I'm going with NAH.\n\nYou meant the comment in a different context than how your wife interpreted it, but I can also see where she's coming from. Perhaps she's a bit more bothered by not having a genetic relation to the baby than she initially said, or maybe it was something that developed over time. Either way, I don't think either of you are at fault.", "NAH. Mom wasn\u2019t insensitive. Perfectly natural comment because you walked early too. Your wife feels a bit excluded but hopefully after considering the comment, she will get over that. Your baby will get things from both of you.  Kids emulate their parents. It\u2019s not all about genetics. Not even sort of. She\u2019ll emulate you and your wife as she grows because you are her parents.", "NAH from what I can tell. My parents and my wife's parents always point out how our kids resemble or behave like we did. Neither of us takes offense, it's a grandparent thing. Your child will adopt traits of your spouse through behavior as much as genetics.", "NAH. Even a non-biologically related kid (or a niece or nephew) would get the \"mini you\" or \"junior you\" comment for exhibiting a trait of yours. It is likely to happen also with your wife, as the child mimics what she sees. Your wife did overreact, but as long as it's just feels and she discusses it with you, that's what you have to do as parents to work through things. A reply wasn't really needed, but you could tell your mom privately to be sensitive about issues that may emphasize genetics.", "ESH not your mom tho. You do for just keeping the peace instead of pointing out to your wife this isn\u2019t about her. Your wife needs to seek some therapy over her insecurity over this.\n\nYour mom is naturally going to see you in your children. Further the \u201ctraits from both of us\u201d is kinda nonsense. The baby will learn behaviors from your wife but will not have her traits, those are from genetics.", "NAH \n\nIn my experience, grandparents always see their own children in their grand babies. Like, honestly if you brought in someone else\u2019s baby and told them it was yours they\u2019d be like OF COURSE THEYRE JUST LIKE YOU. Grandparents, good ones at least, are just nuts for their grandkids and it makes them reminiscent of your childhood as well.\n\nI can see how this is a sensitive subject for your wife. I also don\u2019t think your mom was at all thinking about biology.\n\nYour wife has to become comfortable with the situation. She is EVERY BIT a mother, but she may need some counseling to help her fully allow herself to accept that fact and not worry about the genetics", "NTA, but I appreciate you being sensitive to your wife\u2019s concerns. Your mom is NTA either. My wife and I adopted (both women), and people would say at times how our daughter was more like one of us, despite everyone knowing there was no genetic component. \n\nI\u2019ve had plenty of friends in your exact situation. My advice is to keep open communication and when legit, point out characteristics of your child that mimic your wife. Trust me, there will be many. Just don\u2019t overdo it. That will just seem like you are patronizing her and might get annoying.", "We make comments about how one of our cats \"takes after his father\" or is \"just like his mom\" and neither one of us is genetically related to either cat! I think this is just a thing you say and part of building a family. I understand how your wife may feel sensitive about it but it's 100% not about her.", "I think your wife is overly sensitive. Sometimes we end up being the vessel to bring for our partner's mini me. She is probably realizing she should of used her own egg if it means so much to see herself in her child", "I don't necessarily think she (your mother) is the A here, I think she (your mother) was just emotional and reacted a bit thoughtlessly, which you made sure to sternly correct. If more things like this happen in the future, then have a more serious talk with her. This may very well have just been a one time thing.\n\nFor now, at least, NAH", "Your wife shouldn\u2019t have agreed to this if she was going to be this sensitive. The child will naturally have some of your traits\u2014it\u2019s your biological child.", "NTA. You\u2019re the only parent with a genetic tie to your child, but the kid is going to take after both of you because you\u2019ll both be raising her. When it comes to baby stuff, your parents are going to point out similarities to you because they knew you as a baby. But as she gets older and starts learning from you both, there will be opportunities to call her a \u201cmini\u201d each of you.", "NTA. And your mother isn't either, it's silly to pretend there's no genetic connection between you.", "Nature vs nurture \nMy current husband came into my and my kids life 13 years ago. My daughter was 8 and son 15. \nMy daughter is his daughter and OMG she is just like him in very many ways. Attitude and sarcasm and she is hilarious. \nYou are NTA and your child will pick up traits from both of you. \ud83d\udc99", "NAH\n\nThat's a generic and normal comment along the lines of \"she has your nose\" or \"he gets that from your family\",  etc.\n\nUnless your mom has a habit of excluding your wife? Going forward,  be aware of the possibility,  for your wife's sake and the baby's sake, because even the best intentioned of people can have unintentional biases.", "NAH.  A very different dynamic, but the Saltzmann sisters of the show Legacies take after their different moms.  One is more like bio-mom, while the other is more like gestational mom.\n\nUnless there is considerable friction between your mom and wife, your mom was probably well-intentioned.  Your wife might still be recovering from the hormonal toll of pregnancy, and could be feeling regret at not providing the egg as well.  If you're open to more children, and if your own health doesn't preclude carrying, talk about a reversal of roles for baby #2.", "Can\u2019t second this enough. There will be comments forever - \u201cSusie has your eyes!\u201d \u201cGood at basketball, just like her mama!\u201d It\u2019s not about her other mom being any less her mother, just about noticing similarities. If she\u2019s more like non-bio mom, there will probably be nature vs nurture comments, too - \u201cShe sure didn\u2019t get her math grades from you! Must be Mama2\u2019s influence!\u201d You can\u2019t let it get to you.", "Nah-  you mum only knew you as a little girl, so she is only ever going to see you in her grand daughter I\u2019m afraid-  that\u2019s not a comment on genetics and will be annoying for any parent when a mil/fil says they such a lil op..", "We joke that our one dog definitely got his long legs and anxiety from my side of the family.   It's good to know we aren't alone in saying silly things like this! \ud83d\ude1c", "We joke that our one dog definitely got his long legs and anxiety from my side of the family.
