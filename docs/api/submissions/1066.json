Of course you're not going to dinner at his and his mistress's house, what is he thinking? I guess he thought he could switch out his wife for his mistress and no one would care.", "NTA she is still your friend even if he is your friend. And you are absolutely allowed to have boundaries that include not wanting to spend anytime with her. If that means he no longer considers you a friend so be it.  Your husband can meet them together outside of your home but you and your kids never need to be anywhere near her.\n\nAs for the kids coming round when he has them, maybe end that if he pushes things now and gets mad at you.  If he lets it go fine, but if he keeps saying you are unreasonable, then you you need to tell your husband you no longer feel its appropriate he comes over to your shared house which is a safes pace for you. That again your husband can meet him anytime but you dont have to.  Your kids will spend time with his kids when their mother has them and  your husband can go to a bar or cafe to meet his friend or go round to his place.", "NTA. You can accept or reject an invitation to a house... its an invitation. \n\nAlso he cheated on his wife and moved in with the woman he had an affair with. He must expect some social repercussions from that. He can't force you to like or spend time with this woman, particularly when it would hurt his wife and you are trying to manage your friendship with both of them.", "He's upset that his neutral party friends don't welcome his mistress? NTA, he's delusional. If you did become friendly with the AP, then you're no longer neutral and are actively hurting his former wife who you're also friends with. All too soon.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you weren't his friend, but his wife's in the 1st place. \n\nHe's awfully entitled, demanding you pretend to play happy house with him and his side piece! You've been far more accommodating than he deserves already. If it were me, he wouldn't have even be allowed at my home.\n\nTime to draw some boundaries with this guy and let him know where his stands with you. If he accuses you of being mean, don't try to defend yourself. Just say \"yup\" and ignore him.\n\nAnd yes, you going to dinner there WOULD hurt your friend. She'd probably trust you less and fell like you condone his cheating on her.", "NTA, she is your good friend and still your neighbor.

She's one of your best friends. It would be different if it was just him, but it would be a bit of a betrayal when its still so fresh. And you said your husband can go, so it's not like you are completely ignoring him or anything. He's the AH for not understanding how uncomfortable a sitiation it is.

You still see him in your house, because of the kids, and maybe he is more friends with your husband. Everything good there.\n\nBut going to his new place and dining with his new gf is a different story. You are definitely NTA for not doing this, for being a good friend. No one is entitled to your friendship, you choose your friends.

It\u2019s correct that you don\u2019t want her - and you don\u2019t want him either. Why would you want to rubber stamp an affair, much less an affair that hurt your friend? And why should you have to?\n\nI generally don\u2019t judge people, except when it\u2019s something that hurts others.  Affairs are up there in my permissible judgment area. The issue is that you very easily could have stayed optically neutral while being a supportive friend. But I think the husband is actually putting you in a difficult position by doing this. It may even be some power play against his wife. In this situation, I would skip it.

And all this squares with  . . .\n\nYour husband: who I agree could acceptably (in your eyes) show some support to his friend, though I think the better position would be for him to tell his buddy that he'd feel more comfortable accepting the invitation down the road, after things have settled down some.

This was in the 80s, so this hardly raised eyebrows. Anyway, he wanted desperately for us to be BFFs with the new girl while I was besties with his wife. Finally agreed to a dinner at our favorite pizza place, which had chess sets on the tables.

The problem is that we've been taught so much to \"go along to get along\" we think there is something wrong with that.

Your neighbor did a bad thing and should be judged accordingly.", "I would say that yes, I am trying to make her feel unwelcomed lol NTA", "Ignore what he is saying because you are allowed to feel exactly as you do, he doesn't get to dictate how you feel or what you feel, if it makes you uncomfortable then tell the bloody man, you helped him but his choices made you feel this way, then he has to realise that he made those choices an they come with reprocushions", "NTA he's living with the mistress he used to hurt your friend.

If I know someone has cheated, I'm pretty much done. No contact, or very limited, depending on the relationship altogether. \n\nThis is why. Fidelity is the foundation of marriage.

But for him to expect/demand that you immediately jump into visiting his space with the person he cheated on your friend with because he wants validation that he did nothing wrong?

Since when are friends obligated to accept and welcome a cheater's side piece?  No way.  I'm kind of shocked that your husband wants to go, or that you're OK with him going.

There is one set that after a long break, we hang out with both separately, but it was AWKWARD. Esp for us because my husband isn't the most outgoing with the guy friends. So in order for them to try to hang out with us, they have to go through me and then there's this whole weird dynamic of \"why is he texting you and not me\" that none of us asked for.  \n\n\nJeeze ok that was a whole sidenote.
