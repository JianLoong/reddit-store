Of course you're not going to dinner at his and his mistress's house, what is he thinking? I guess he thought he could switch out his wife for his mistress and no one would care.", "NTA she is still your friend even if he is your friend. And you are absolutely allowed to have boundaries that include not wanting to spend anytime with her. If that means he no longer considers you a friend so be it.  Your husband can meet them together outside of your home but you and your kids never need to be anywhere near her.\n\nAs for the kids coming round when he has them, maybe end that if he pushes things now and gets mad at you.  If he lets it go fine, but if he keeps saying you are unreasonable, then you you need to tell your husband you no longer feel its appropriate he comes over to your shared house which is a safes pace for you. That again your husband can meet him anytime but you dont have to.  Your kids will spend time with his kids when their mother has them and  your husband can go to a bar or cafe to meet his friend or go round to his place.", "NTA. You can accept or reject an invitation to a house... its an invitation. \n\nAlso he cheated on his wife and moved in with the woman he had an affair with. He must expect some social repercussions from that. He can't force you to like or spend time with this woman, particularly when it would hurt his wife and you are trying to manage your friendship with both of them.", "He's upset that his neutral party friends don't welcome his mistress? NTA, he's delusional. If you did become friendly with the AP, then you're no longer neutral and are actively hurting his further wife who you're also friends with. All too soon.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you weren't his friend, but his wife's in the 1st place. \n\nHe's awfully entitled, demanding you pretend to play happy house with him and his side piece! You've been far more accommodating than he deserves already. If it were me, he wouldn't have even be allowed at my home.\n\nTime to draw some boundaries with this guy and let him know where his stands with you. If he accuses you of being mean, don't try to defend yourself. Just say \"yup\" and ignore him.\n\nAnd yes, you going to dinner there WOULD hurt your friend. She'd probably trust you less and fell like you condone his cheating on her.", "NTA, she is your good friend and still your neighbor. You\u2019re doing your best not to choose sides, but in this case where he is essentially forcing you to, you have to stick with the friend/wife/neighbor.", "NTA \n\nSometimes you have to pick sides when your friends divorce. Having dinner with the mistress isn\u2019t a good look.", "NTA\n\nWhy do cheaters always seem to assume that they can cheat on a spouse, discard them, then slot the affair partner into their place and carry on exactly as before?\n\nYou're doing the right thing by being loyal to your friend- why on earth does he think you'd want to jeopardise a close friendship for the sake of a cheater and his affair partner?", "NTA. She's one of your best friends. It would be different if it was just him, but it would be a bit of a betrayal when its still so fresh. And you said your husband can go, so it's not like you are completely ignoring him or anything. He's the AH for not understanding how uncomfortable a sitiation it is. It's the woman he broke up his family for.", ">1) refusing to join our neighbor and friend to dinner at his new place 2) he says I\u2019m judgmental for not accepting his new girlfriend\n\n\n\nYou are being judgemental. Hell, *I\u2019m* being judgemental and wife isn\u2019t even my friend. He deserves judgement and doesn\u2019t get to keep your support after he hurt your friend. NTA", "I don\u2019t think so no NTA. As long as he knows that you\u2019re not ostracizing him or judging him. \n\nyou\u2019re just friends with his wife and it feels  \u2026..  it\u2019s too soon. And you\u2019re not insisting that your husband does not go, so I think everybody should understand. After some time goes by maybe it\u2019ll be different but for now this is the way it is", "Exactly. If you have the whole story, like OP does, it's perfectly acceptable to judge people by their actions.", "NTA", "Nta. He cheated and wants everything to be hunky dory. No.", "NTA - You are *currently* doing the emotional labor of supporting his wife whose heart he presumably destroyed with his cheating. You do not have to go play grateful house-guest at his. And you aren\u2019t being wrongly judgmental for not doing so.", "NTA\nI wouldn\u2019t remain friends with a cheater and I really wouldn\u2019t want my husband friends with someone who likes to cheat.", "NTA", "NTA. And this is not a story about neighbours, it is a story about friendship. You are a couple, and you befriended the neighbor couple. In your case, more with the wife, who is also your coworker. Then they broke up. And you do what good friends do, you stick with your friend, you are there for her. You still see him in your house, because of the kids, and maybe he is more friends with your husband. Everything good there.\n\nBut going to his new place and dining with his new gf is a different story. You are definitely NTA for not doing this, for being a good friend. No one is entitled to your friendship, you choose your friends. And when someone hurts a good friend it is very understandable that you don't want to be friends with them.\n\nAnd you and your hubby are adults, you can have different friends, he can go on his own. Nothing wrong with that.", "> As long as he knows that you\u2019re not ostracizing him or judging him. \n\n*What??* A man who cheats on his wife, and moves in with another woman while they're still married, *should* be ostracized and judged.", "she sounded like they were all still friends and that he was welcome at their house any time\n \n\nSHE also said \u201cshe was in no position to judge him\u201d so i was only going along with her narrative. \n\noh so you have no divorced friends??   you don\u2019t know anybody that lived thru a similar scenario??\n\n\u201cjudge not lest ye be judged\u201d.  sound familiar?", "NTA - you are being true to your friend. You do not have to go anywhere you feel uncomfortable and no one should force you to do so. He made his bed and now he can lay in it and where you stick your rod can break friendship circles. Time for him to learn it isn\u2019t just his marriage he messed up.\n\nGood on you for being a good friend. They\u2019re hard to come by.\n\nCan\u2019t believe it\u2019s so fresh and he\u2019s already living with the women he broke his home for. Feel so bad for your friend.", "NTA at all! Your feelings are perfectly warranted and valid and if you feel uncomfortable in any way, you should not go! People are entitled to their opinions as you are yours.", "NTA, good on you for being loyal.", "NTA you don\u2019t have to be friends with anyone you don\u2019t want to. Tell him you\u2019ll consider meeting his next affair partner if the food sounds appealing enough.", "Lol she is unwanted. NTA don\u2019t condone cheating", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHe cheated on his wife, his children, and the life they built.  He expects everyone to just cast his wife aside just like he did and pretend this is OK!\n\nHe's TA for the affair and for putting you in this position.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t go either.", "NTA. It\u2019s correct that you don\u2019t want her - and you don\u2019t want him either. Why would you want to rubber stamp an affair, much less an affair that hurt your friend? And why should you have to?\n\nI generally don\u2019t judge people, except when it\u2019s something that hurts others.  Affairs are up there in my permissible judgment area. The issue is that you very easily could have stayed optically neutral while being a supportive friend. But I think the husband is actually putting you in a difficult position by doing this. It may even be some power play against his wife. In this situation, I would skip it. And ask your husband why it\u2019s so important to your husband that you been seen as not judging his friend for something that is pretty awful.", "NTA", "NTA.  You are absolutely NOT being unreasonable for not wanting to play nicey nice with his mistress.", "NTA. Keep to the Code, sister. Keep to the Code", "You chose the cheated-on over the cheater. This is not an unreasonable decision. He clearly wants to keep all the benefits of his old life without his wife. Not how that works buddy. NTA good for you.", "NTA. Ask your husband why he thinks cheating is okay? Is He cheating?", "Because they are so so so desperate for the guilt to be over they will literally bully others into accepting the affair partner lol", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", "Exactly. If everyone acts like everything is okay, he doesn\u2019t have to feel guilty! NTA OP.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "This is the one.\n\nI know people keep saying being judgemental is a bad thing, but it really isn't sometimes.\n\nUltimately if you cheat on a friend of mine,  i'm judging the crap out of you.   I'm not a bad person for that, i just have certain values and i don't care if people don't like them.", "Exactly. You don't have to make the guys life harder but you don't owe it to him to make it easier and rosy.", "> she sounded like they were all still friends and that he was welcome at their house any time\n\nDid we read the same post?\n\n> oh so you have no divorced friends?? you don\u2019t know anybody that lived thru a similar scenario??\n\nI *do* have divorced friends, and I *do* know someone that lived through the exact same scenario, except that the cheater was the wife. We cut all contact with her, and continued our friendship with the husband.\n\n> \u201cjudge not lest ye be judged\u201d ...\n\n... does not obligate us to continue relationships with toxic people. Does \"by their fruits shall ye know them\" ring any bells?"]}
