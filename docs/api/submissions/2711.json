You deserve the 4 you have right now to make up for lost deliciousness. Next time, buy 5 cupcakes. One to eat on the way home - a secret cupcake if you will, any flavour your heart desires. And 4 to bring into the house. Make sure one of those 4 is red velvet. Now you always have a cupcake!  ;)", "NTA- keep buying Red Velvet until one of them confesses and apologizes. WE MUST CATCH THE CUPCAKE THIEF", "NTA - next time if you choose to buy cupcakes and you want to save your own, purchase a lockbox for just yours and that way it avoids having to worry about someone else taking yours.  If **they're too petty** to let you have your own or even admit to eating your share of what you take the time to bring home, then defending what's yours should teach them a lesson in manners and humility.", "I am gonna wonder if it is your wife who ate the cupcake. Her reaction about \"you don't trust us\" is very much a red flag in the situation. \n\nWell OP it's time for a classic laxative cupcake trap. Let your cupcake be sacrificed, then drop the laxative bomb. Catch them in the act because either their ass or reaction will betray them as the culprit.\n\nOr you know you can always go the hidden camera route and just absolutely wreck both their butthole and pride.

Not cool that someone is stealing your cupcake.\nIt might be just a cupcake, but it's a very worrisome sign.\n\nIf it's your wife, clearly there's some issues in the relationship that need to be addressed, if she feels the need to lie and cheat over something as petty as a cupcake.\n\nIf it's one of your sons, that could be indicative of a bigger behavioral issue, and maybe suggests that they're okay with sneaking and cheating and lying in other aspects of their life, and could only get worse as they grow older.\n\nI think you really need to address the deeper problem at hand here and have a conversation with your family, or maybe talk to each of them one on one and get to the bottom of this.\n\nI applaud your petty revenge, I'd have done the same thing, but it's definitely indicative of a larger problem that should be addressed before it gets worse.", "NTA- definitely petty, but deserved. They clearly can\u2019t be trusted so there is no reason they should be mad that you eat yours on your way home. Maybe this will teach them not to steal your cupcake.", "NTA..... why does it make them feel bad that you eat yours on the way home. What does it matter when and where you eat your cupcake. If they would stop being selfish by eating your cupcake you wouldn't have to do that. I would have done the same thing you wanna keep eating mine I will buy my own treats and make sure it is something they don't like", ">I started eating mine on the way home but my wife says that it makes her and the kids feel bad, like I don't trust them. \n\nNTA Someone in your family is not feeling bad about eating your cupcake, but  is willing to let the blame fall on all three of them,. Which one is the greediest? Which one is the most self centered and selfish?  Those behaviors are usually apparent, you should be able to figure out who is eating yours and lying about it. You are correct in distrusting them because at least one of them has earned it. A small thing but very telling about their character.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
