You deserve the 4 you have right now to make up for lost deliciousness. Next time, buy 5 cupcakes. One to eat on the way home - a secret cupcake if you will, any flavour your heart desires. And 4 to bring into the house. Make sure one of those 4 is red velvet. Now you always have a cupcake!  ;)", "NTA- keep buying Red Velvet until one of them confesses and apologizes. WE MUST CATCH THE CUPCAKE THIEF", "NTA - next time if you choose to buy cupcakes and you want to save your own, purchase a lockbox for just yours and that way it avoids having to worry about someone else taking yours.  If **they're too petty** to let you have your own or even admit to eating your share of what you take the time to bring home, then defending what's yours should teach them a lesson in manners and humility.", "I am gonna wonder if it is your wife who ate the cupcake. Her reaction about \"you don't trust us\" is very much a red flag in the situation. \n\nWell OP it's time for a classic laxative cupcake trap. Let your cupcake be sacrificed, then drop the laxative bomb. Catch them in the act because either their ass or reaction will betray them as the culprit.\n\nOr you know you can always go the hidden camera route and just absolutely wreck both their butthole and pride.

Not cool that someone is stealing your cupcake.\nIt might be just a cupcake, but it's a very worrisome sign.\n\nIf it's your wife, clearly there's some issues in the relationship that need to be addressed, if she feels the need to lie and cheat over something as petty as a cupcake.\n\nIf it's one of your sons, that could be indicative of a bigger behavioral issue, and maybe suggests that they're okay with sneaking and cheating and lying in other aspects of their life, and could only get worse as they grow older.\n\nI think you really need to address the deeper problem at hand here and have a conversation with your family, or maybe talk to each of them one on one and get to the bottom of this.\n\nI applaud your petty revenge, I'd have done the same thing, but it's definitely indicative of a larger problem that should be addressed before it gets worse.", "NTA- definitely petty, but deserved. They clearly can\u2019t be trusted so there is no reason they should be mad that you eat yours on your way home. Maybe this will teach them not to steal your cupcake.", "NTA..... why does it make them feel bad that you eat yours on the way home. What does it matter when and where you eat your cupcake. If they would stop being selfish by eating your cupcake you wouldn't have to do that. I would have done the same thing you wanna keep eating mine I will buy my own treats and make sure it is something they don't like", ">I started eating mine on the way home but my wife says that it makes her and the kids feel bad, like I don't trust them. \n\nNTA Someone in your family is not feeling bad about eating your cupcake, but  is willing to let the blame fall on all three of them,. Which one is the greediest? Which one is the most self centered and selfish?  Those behaviors are usually apparent, you should be able to figure out who is eating yours and lying about it. You are correct in distrusting them because at least one of them has earned it. A small thing but very telling about their character.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No pity for the cupcake thief!!!", "Setup a hidden camera. Let the cupcakes be stolen like 3 or 4 times before you reveal the culprit.", "ESH\n\nThe obvious solution was to buy 2 sets of cupcakes - Red Velvet as a decoy at home and regular ones to eat in your car. Then if anyone asks just say you bought a ton of Red Velvet ones because you had cravings.\n\nThe kids can learn to make delicious cupcakes with their mom. Now they can make as many as they want.

Though the way your wife put it I would bet money that she is the cupcake thief", "NTA! My solution would involve food colouring hidden in the cupcake to find the thief. Inject blue food colour into your cupcake. Remove your cupcake from the package and set it aside so it \"doesnt get eaten this time\". Then the person with the bright blue mouth is the culprit, and no more cupcakes for them for a while!", "Lol petty but eh sometimes you gotta do it. They should leave yours be. Very itty bitty soft YTA. But I'm okay with it.", "ESH. Your wife and kids for eating your cupcake and you for being a cry-baby and for not standing up for yourself. \n\nSomeone is going to feel bad. Either them for not being able to eat your cupcake (since you took a bite from it on your way home) or you.  \n\nOf this is that important to you, give them a choice: you bring cupcakes and they leave over for you or you buy only one cupcake and enjoy it.

Your wife whining and saying that it makes them feel bad that you don't trust them, when they giving you no reason to trust them, is her just being manipulative and whiny.\n\nHonestly maybe it is a little petty, but it's the right move. If people continue to steal from you, and say that you shouldn't take basic countermeasures for them not to steal from you, you're only recourse is to only bring things in that reports them.\n\nIt's not fair that you should only have to eat one kind, because it's not fair that your wife and kids are willing to steal from you", "OP I HAVE A SOLUTION\n\nKeep buying 4 cupcakes every time. And take 1 giant bite (about 25% of each cupcake) from all 4. That way, you get your cupcake, and they all get a taste of karma.\n\nCause there no way all 3 of them don't know who is eating yours. It's some bs.", "NTA. You have every reason not to trust them. And why doesn't your wife care that you feel bad that someone keeps stealing your treat and lying about it? I think it's her seeing as how she's trying to prevent you from eating it beforehand.", "Jalapeno Cupcakes", "NTA.  Buy 4 for home.  And an extra that you eat in the car during the trip.  Key here is hide the evidence.   Then if they eat your \u201chome\u201d cupcake it will not be quite as bad.  Alternative is to lick the top of your cupcake while staring at the family.  Then save it for later.  If they want it after that then this is not a hungry person but just someone intentionally messing with you.", "Or if you find laxatives distasteful, how about injecting your cupcake with blue food dye?

That's why I assumed", "You sir, bring much logic to this.\n\nOr OP could continue to bring home 4 cupcakes, and before anyone gets to eat theirs, OP can take 25% of each cupcake. A nice big bite from each. That way someone can have the fourth and OP totally got their cupcake! \ud83d\ude08", "Laxative isn't poison. You do seem to have a habit of being very dramatic in your language choice.\n\nEdit: It's also not retaliation. Retaliation would be finding out who it is and then doing something to them, setting a booby trap is simply the only logical way to expose a sneak thief that doesn't involve wasting a bunch of your own time.", "I think anything that makes someone ill with that express intent is poison? It doesn't have to kill someone to be poison? \n\nWhat if you put laxatives in someones food and they get really sick or have bad reaction?", "Poisoning by definition is causing harm with a drug, chemical, or other substance. There is no harm caused by making you need to shit. \n\nLike most things if you used a ridiculous amount it could probably become poison, but assuming they're using that much is an assumption. You might as well assume they're using poisonous amounts of everything at that point. \n\n>What if you put laxatives in someones food and they get really sick or have bad reaction?\n\nThen you'd have poisoned them."]}
