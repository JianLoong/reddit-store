I do have the habit unfortunately of just leaving my 2 litre water bottle around because there shouldn\u2019t be the need to hide it we\u2019re all adults here and boundaries should be respected. Today was a particular hot day and I was working night shift up until the morning. I waited for my other co workers to arrive so I could take the day off anyway this co worker who was recently on leave comes up to me we greet and everything and all things are polite and then when I turn to assist a patient  I see her smacking on my water. I\u2019m so mad internally and I blow up on her but in a passive way not trying to make a scene luckily I had a straw inside she has the audacity to tell me that she didn\u2019t use her lips ( I joke that she\u2019s definitely back because she\u2019s the infamous water drinker) then on cue another co worker almost as if takes it as a sign and drinks my water directly from his mouth at this point I\u2019m fuming because I feel so mad disrespected like you don\u2019t respect me or my boundaries I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s the age gap that got them thinking that way. We literally have a tap in our department and it\u2019s the fact that they didn\u2019t even bother asking first.
