You personally shouldn't engage with strangers the way he does because it would be much less safe for you. \n\nThat's not just because he's a man and probably more physically intimidating, but also because the person who is confident and aware of their surroundings does not look nearly as much like a victim as the woman fearfully tugging her husband's arm or anxiously pacing back and forth. \n\nObviously, no one is immune to getting mugged, but a mugger is looking for an easy target. They're looking for someone who is likely to capitulate and follow directions immediately. They aren't trying to convince someone they're actually scary or willing to harm them. They aren't trying to get chatted up by an easy-going, friendly dude while waiting for the right moment to pull their knife out. \n\nYour husband has less experience in the city and possibly with people intending him harm. That doesn't mean he can't tell when someone seems dangerous. You suspect everyone of being dangerous, which is much safer than guessing wrong. \n\nMy husband has lived on the streets before. Some people he will ignore and walk past, and others he will go out of his way to help. Most are people who inspire more fear than empathy in me, but I would never ask him to give up paying forward kindness to those in need. I trust his judgment and his agency in choosing that the risk is worth treating people like they are humans deserving of respect and empathy and not rabid dogs to cross the street to avoid provoking. \n\nThere are many times that someone he chooses to help have been ignored and avoided enough times to start feeling less than human. Sometimes people appreciate being treated as an equal even more than the money or whatever else they needed. \n\nAt the end of the day, everyone has different risk tolerances. If you feel your husband is exposing you to danger, then you should address that with him and ask him to consider your comfort level before offering help.

Totally reasonable, though I guess my point was not well out since people seem to misunderstand. That\u2019s why I say NAH.
