Some people he will ignore and walk past, and others he will go out of his way to help.

This is based on assuming certain facts are true, but ones I am comfortable backing up if needed. Women are perceived as softer targets and as a gender, have less upper body strength compared to many of their potential attackers (men) and men comprise the majority of those committing violent crime. Women are a gender minority subject to societal forces that encourage and enable violence against them, and are especially at risk for sexualized violence, while also being taught to behave in ways likely to increase their victimization. Cities generally have higher crimes rates for many reasons. Cities have more people---OP has had far more interactions with other people on which to base her concerns. \n\nSo let's say that, based on her experience prior to marriage, 70% of strangers approaching = negative. It would make sense to ignore and avoid these interactions if at all possible. OP is rational.\n\nOP's husband may have a much lower rate of being approached by hostile strangers (gender, home town crime rate), especially because it sounds like his experience in the city is as part of a couple.
