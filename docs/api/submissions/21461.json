People saying otherwise have never lived in a city. It\u2019s called street smarts for a reason. Stand your ground. Stranger danger is real and crime is up in all metropolitan areas. Be safe!", "Just ask him to be more careful you can\u2019t change who he is.", "NTA. Trust your gut always. Your husband might have great radar for people too. At least I hope it isn't total naivety, and he would run in a truly dangerous scenario. But you two need to have a talk where if EITHER of you feel uncomfortable you BOTH leave, because that wasn't cool.", "Nta, you and your husband have had different upbringings and it shows, you should probably tell your husband about your guilt if you haven\u2019t already", "NTA. I was like him until i moved to a big metro city and tried to talk to someone at a gas pump. They're wondering wtf you're gonna ask of them. He will likely be okay, but people are ready to fleece guys like him.", "NTA, there's a time and place for good deeds and sometimes you means you can not help everyone like your partner wants to do.", "NTA I also want to talk about being compliant just because you have always been taught to be polite. Screw that. You don't owe anybody anything. Keep yourself safe first. Search Ted Bundy, etc.", "NTA. In my hometown, being that naive would get you mugged, hurt or even killed.", "NAH. Lol you\u2019re both right. I have the same soft spots as your hubs, and even though my wife is sorta the same way, she is a lot more cautious. After letting me know a few times that the situation i put us in made her uncomfortable, I knew I had to be more discerning. Even if just for her comfort levels versus actual danger. \n\n\nMaybe you could just ask him to cool down his approachable meter when you\u2019re around, and let it rip when he\u2019s alone.", "Yta - he's treating people like they're human beings.", "YTA.\n\nThere's a happy medium here. The vast majority of strangers aren't going to hurt you, and it's a bit overkill to be rude to everyone you meet just in case one of them might take advantage of your kindness and harm you. I understand that your experiences have made you paranoid, which is valid, but that doesn't mean your husband's approach is wrong. \n\nYou should be aware of your surroundings, definitely. But that doesn't mean you can't be altruistic\u2014you just judge each situation on a case by case basis. Has your husband ever demonstrated that he's incorrectly judged someone's character? Has anything bad ever resulted from his kindness? Because I think you're a bit out of line in implying that your husband's kindness is a result of some sort of simple, rural ignorance borne of his country upbringing.\n\nSomeone once tried to mug me, but they hadn't asked me for money. It was random. I've since given money to beggars at times, let random people use my hotspot or phone charger, and nothing bad has ever come of it.", "INFO: Are you a woman?  \n\nINFO: You say you've been \"mugged at gunpoint, harassed, feared for my life in encounters exactly like that.\"  Has any of this happened to your husband?  What's the worst that's happened to him on account of helping a stranger?\n\nINFO: Has your husband ever refused to interact with a stranger?  Obviously he interacts with quite a few strangers, but are there some he turns down or avoids?\n\nWithout knowing answers to the above, I have a few thoughts: You husband comes across as someone who can take care of himself, so he's not as much of a target for physical violence as you.  Your husband actually does understand \"stranger danger,\" but whereas you assume all strangers are dangerous, he actually assesses strangers, and only avoids the ones he believes may be dangerous or has a bad feeling about. \\*That's\\* real street smarts, not being categorically afraid of everyone you don't know.\n\nI get that you're concerned, but we actually need many more people like your husband in our world!", "Nta he is gonna get killed one of these days", "YTA\nYour experiences have shaped your reactions to things, which is fine but to expect the people around you to show the same blanket rudeness you show to strangers is taking it too far. \nIf you\u2019re allowed to be rude to every stranger you encounter, then why is your husband not allowed to be kind to every stranger?", "YTA. Sounds like your partner has navigated many of these situations in ways where the worst thing not only didn\u2019t happen but another outcome did.\n\nInstead of judging your partner as a ignorant soft hick (which is absolutely how you are coming across to me) consider that you\u2019ve been living in the city so long you\u2019ve forgotten basic human decency because you are surrounded by so much dysfunction and misery that you\u2019ve grown accustomed to assuming the worst in people.\n\nEspecially when they are poor or ill.\n\nPS. Yes. I have lived in cities before. And the country. And the suburbs. I recognize there are dangers, but if you love something about your husband that you now feel endangers you, perhaps consider you want to change the very thing you love about him rather than consider you need to change a little about yourself instead.\n\nAsk yourself if that\u2019s what you want to do or should do. Good luck.", "YTA\n\n\u201cMy husband has MANNERS, how dare he\u201d. \n\nI know you don\u2019t want him getting hurt, but instead you could tell him red flags to look out for.
