I doubt you'll find an American who will say you\u2019re the asshole. Here, this is common and is often the result of having successful children.

You weren\u2019t part of a contract with your parents that said you would be less than 100 km from them for their entire life. People move. I\u2019m sorry they find it upsetting, and you obviously do as well. But that does not mean you aren\u2019t making an appropriate choice.", "NTA. Isn't that a tad melodramatic? \n\nDo they have zero friends or other relatives? Can you afford to get them live in care or someone to check in on them regularly? If one passes, can the other live with you or your sibling or go into a nursing home?\n\nWith technology and money, you don't have to be physically close to make sure your loved ones are taken care of.", "NTA Your parents are active and healthy. At 60 they could live many more decades. You need to live your life.\n\nI moved 3,000 miles from my mother who has shunned me for 30 years because I left her religion. I saw her briefly before I moved and she said I was abandoning her! I'm not even allowed to call her. WTF? Parents can have some strange ways of excusing their behavior.", "Leaving my mom to be alone was the number one reason I never considered moving to another place when I finished university. There were 4 kids in my family, and the others had already relocated, so it was down to me. That was my priority. You have to decide yours.", "NAH.  I certainly think you should keep in touch; perhaps you should try to help them get more friendships with people and connections with their local community. \n\nHere is where I am coming from.  I and my parents live in Massachusetts, perhaps a half hour apart, but my sister lives in Florida, and my wife's brother and parents live in Florida, perhaps half an hour apart, but my wife lives up here.\n\nSo each of our parents has a child nearby.\n\nThe thing is, if Lis and I moved away from Mom and Dad, or Josh and his wife moved away from their parents, Mom and Dad and MIL and FIL would all be totally fine, because all four of them have friends and communities and other people besides their children whom they can rely on.  They have all built connections other than us.  This means that, even though all of us can, and do, have connecton with each other, we aren't trapped, because our parents don't *need* us.  They like us as well as love us; they enjoy our company, but nobody is *stuck*.\n\nAnd with that, I think my sister talks to my parents ten times as much as I do.  (She has a longer commute, so just phones family while she is driving to catch up with folks.)\n\nSo, before you go, I would try to see if I could help them get involved with stuff.  If they are even a tiny bit religious, getting to know people at your local church or mosque or whatever can be a great starting point  to have a people you can hang out with.  Or classes and hobbies.  Your father can join a local quilting circle, your mother can finally go to that local garage and get people to help rebuild the car engine she has been planning on working on, or whatever.\n\nIt sucks to think of your parents alone, but they don't necessarily need *you* for company.", "I will go with NAH. I don't think you are wrong about going where your life will be its best, but I think it is OK for your parents to be scared. I don't know your parents, are they manipulative people or are they just very sad? \n\nThe answer might be to sit down and talk about arrangements with them so they aren't so fearful. Let them know you still love them (if they are not big AH) and you will have contact with them. Encourage them to visit (only if you aren't leaving due to bad behavior).", "NTA. Sounds like their whole plan for old age was for their children to care for them. And that's absolutely ridiculous. \nINFO. You've mentioned they are pretty healthy...Can't they move as well?", "Would they consider relocating with you", "NTA. This is a very hard situation all around, but you shouldn't put your own life on hold waiting on your parents to die to start living. \n\nIt sucks for them, sure. But you don't owe them to stick around to care for them. They are adults, they need to take care of themselves and not depend on you for emotional support.", "NTA. It isn't an easy decision, and I appreciate that. But, as others have said, you can't put your life on hold for another 15+ years waiting on them to die. \n\nIn a comment, you said they travel abroad annually. That likely means they have the finances to move to the area your brother lives, if not \"dying alone\" is that important to them.", "NAH. These are simply really, really hard choices and come with a lot of heartache. Your parents are not wrong for wanting you to stay, but you\u2019re not wrong for deciding to go.", "NTA.\n\nMy youngest daughter (34) just moved 2,000 miles away. I encouraged her and so did others. In the times we are in, you need to build the best life for yourself and immediate family that you possibly can.\n\nWith video calls available, money transfers easily done, travel back to visit possible - this is fair.

Live your life.", "NTA    I'm sure you love your parents, but you shouldn't be tied at the hip to them until their passing.  Depends on what your priorities are.   I went through this when I moved several thousand miles away.    I always made sure every time we spoke to say \"I love you\" and made sure I did things to make them know how I felt.   Not sure of your spiritual beliefs, and culture has a play in this, but sometimes you just cannot be there for a multitude of reasons.", "NTA. Didn't they raise you with the hopes of you bettering your life? This is a huge opportunity for you, take it. They can research senior's clubs etc, medical help in their area. My mom would be sad but she'd never say anything other than she would miss me. My dad def wouldn't say shit either.", "All I can say is it's your call, totally. Maybe, you can negotiate and unanimously agree on something or maybe you can just abandon them. Whatever you do, just make sure you don't live with any regrets. I'm not trying to pull you down but I've seen posts where people express how disappointed they are in themselves. How terrible they feel because they couldn't meet their xyz due to their work and that they're dead now.\nGood luck buddy", "NAH. This just makes me sad. I don\u2019t live anywhere near family and am quite lonely, but did this of my own volition.

It\u2019s hard, especially talking countryside. \n\nBoth me and my partner are the only kids. One day we decide to move to Canada and even get qualified for that. The other side of the world, basically, on kinda tight budget which would prevent us from jumping continents just like that. Me and my mom are rather distant from each other, my support is mostly limited to money. My grandma is who raised me, and that\u2019s deadly tough to leave her but I we just have to try because of my partner\u2019s health issues, easily manageable in US, EU or Canada but not where we\u2019re from. \n\nBut my MIL was absolutely broken. She\u2019s 60ish at the moment, quite a good health (diabetes but manageable), lots of friends, a bit of job she likes, two adult grandkids (from my partner\u2019s first marriage) literally next door. And yet she\u2019s absolutely broken, she calls us every day, cries, insists there should be other options and everything. \n\nMy partner got terrified and broken as well. They\u2019re very close with their mother, even though their relationship is rather rocky. So everyone cries, but eventually we\u2019re going to Canada. We have this friend of ours who moved there a year before us, she meets us, helps us, explains things to us and whatnot. We start kinda settling down\u2026 and then it happens. \n\nThat friend of ours, she\u2019s from our country as well, and where she\u2019s from is quite a middle of nowhere. So say she wants to go home right now, we\u2019re talking 2-3 days and thousands of dollars to the plane tickets. She has mother and sister back home and a little kid with her in Canada. It\u2019s her first month on the very first real job. Her sister calls and says their mother had a stroke, and things look bad. They\u2018be always been close with mom, and there\u2019s a lot of panic and plans going back and forth: should she go back immediately? What about the kid? The job? The money? They decide to wait for a while to see how it goes, but then next day her sister calls again and says mom\u2019s gone, and our friend won\u2019t make it to the funeral even if she leaves like now. \n\nThat hit our friend very hard. We did try to offer any possible kind of help ofc but nothing seemed helping. She lost the job and was in a really bad place in life for quite a long time afterwards. I don\u2019t dare to say she fully recovered even now. \n\nAnd it also hit us, especially my partner. We imagined ourselves in the same situation, and it was unbearable for them. So we decided to come back and look for the options in EU, closer to home. It was a big risk for my partner\u2019s health to go back to the country where the therapy is unavailable but eventually everything settled down. \n\nWhat we\u2019ve learned from Canada and EU though is that almost every immigrant has a story or two of similar kind. So it may make sense to be very honest with yourselves considering those big moves: what exactly I\u2019m going to do if one of my parents suddenly dies? Needs any special assistance? Gets to the hospital? How I\u2019m going to handle financial aspects? Emotional aspects? What are our plans A, B, C and straight to Z for various emergencies and what I\u2019m ready to be responsible for? \n\nBe honest. Be clear. Take all the time you need but get yourself those answers. Talk them through in the family. None of that is very comfortable, and you\u2019ll need a lot of support probably, but it does make sense to sort out in advance. You gotta understand what\u2019s the heartache you\u2019re ready for and what\u2019s not. \n\nSorry for the unsolicited advice, it just feels so close to what we\u2019ve been through. It didn\u2019t cost us much fortunately but it does for a lot of fellow immigrants. Hope you\u2019ll never have to face it yourself.", "Oh please they are 60 not 90.
