Jacob freaked out and said he has a child of his own and won't take Alex no matter how much Alex begged him. I too had a child but I couldn't let him end up in the system so I took him with me. Needless to say it was probably the best decision I ever made and Alex is truely like a son to me now. Alex never really forgave Jacob for abandoning him like that \n\nNow Jacob needs a place for 6 months(long story) and asked for my help. I can't let him be homeless so I decided to let him stay with us. \n\nAlex and my daughter Nora aren't happy with my decision. They have decided to completely ignore them and don't change anything about their lives. This includes playing videogames loudly at night( I work nights so I don't have a problem with it in summer) to only making enough food for the 3 of us when it's their turn to cook and completely ignoring Jacob's kids. \n\nJacob thinks I'm an asshole and should do something about it but he is upset and he is allowed to feel the way he does and shouldn't be punished for it", "created_utc": 1692223138, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15t3ito/aita_for_not_punishing_my_kids/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Everyone is being pissy.", "ESH\n\nIt\u2019s your home. Your kids are not responsible for entertaining (or liking) your guests & Jacob is a big boy he can fend for himself. If he doesn\u2019t like the accommodations he can stay somewhere else. However.... \n\neta \u2014 based on your responses ... you appear to be enjoying that your kids are acting like this.

If they can\u2019t help, don\u2019t hurt.", "I would say you're a little bit TA: Alex is absolutely within his rights to ignore Jacob (as Jacob ignored him), but the kids didn't do anything and they're having a hard time - just letting Alex ignore them is a bit of a dick move.", "I don't know how many times I have to say this, feelings are valid but behaviours aren't.  So yes Alex's feelings towards Jacob are valid and shouldn't be punished, however his behaviours certainly aren't and should be addressed, along with Nora's. \n\nYTA for allowing it to continue unaddressed.", "YTA. If you want your kids to live a totally uninterrupted life, don\u2019t let the dude they\u2019re so resentful of move in. If you want your brother and his kids to have a place to stay you can offer to pay for it. \nBut you\u2019re responsible to hold your children to basic standards of etiquette towards people in their home. I can\u2019t imagine you would let them treat any other stranger this way (old friend, random cousin, whoever). Don\u2019t ever say anything in front of your brother but tell them to drop this shit.", "ESH\n\nAdded people are never fun, and sure your brother may of deserved it, but time to tell the kiddos to dial back the AH-ness a few notch's. For the gaming, a nice gaming headset will do, as for the cooking and that, that is a bit dicey,", "I haven\u2019t seen it answered so don\u2019t think it\u2019s been asked. Are Jacob and family \u201cdonating\u201d anything for this situation? $$ for extra bills, house work, yard work, pet care? Or are they treating it like a 5 star resort where they\u2019re waited on hand and foot?", "Sorry but YTA.  Jacob made a decision to not step up while you did. While I think it\u2019s great what you done for your brother you are allowing them to be disrespectful brats to your brothers kids that have nothing to do with it.\n\nAlex was 7 and while it\u2019s a horrible thing to go through your brother is not responsible for him.  Get Alex some therapy. His anger should be placed with his mother and not Jacob.  You should also think about therapy for yourself, you still sound very resentful towards your brother and your comments make it sound like you enjoy what your kids are doing.\n\nAt the end of the day it\u2019s basic common decency, parent your kids and teach them not to be assholes.", "YTA. Jacob\u2019s kids have done nothing wrong, your kids shouldn\u2019t be hurting them.", "NTA, did Jacob tell Alex he was sorry for his actions?\n\nPlus, he is a grown ass man, he can cook for himself and his kids, why do yours have to cater? If Jacob doesn't like it, he is free to leave. He didn't care enough to take a kod, who was his half brother and would end up in a system, why does Alex have to cate about him being fed or sleeping?", "YTA.    Why is your daughter  so rude?  She has no bone to pick with Jacob\n\n\nYour brother said he couldn't take  Alex 10 years ago. That's his decision.  Is Alex going to hold it against  him until he dies", "YTA. If you know your kids are doing this just o be mean...you're complicit. \n\n*\"They have headphones but I guess that would go against their goal which is making his life hell\"*\n\nYou spent your post complaining about how Jacob treated Alex; now you're encouraging/complicit as they repeat the cycle on your nephew/niece. \n\nWhat's the goal here? You seem to want to perpetuate the poor treatment of family in the next generation. You seem to be okay with your kids being jerks to their cousins, or is that not okay with you? Because you're letting it happen and the only one capable of saying anything. \n\nWe all know that if Jacob disciplines or says anything about your kids; your next AITA post will be about how you kicked him out for talking to your kids. So he talked to you instead and you said its fine that your kids treat their cousins badly.", "YTA. You don't need to \"punish\" them, but there is something called being civil to guests that you can expect of them. The cooking thing is especially rude, since they are using groceries you provide. If they have a \"turn\" for cooking for the household, that includes more people now. (Though maybe fewer turns are in order with more people.) \n\nAllowing a 10yo grudge to fester isn't the best parenting decision. Yes, Alex is allowed his feelings, but (for instance) Jacob's children never did him any harm and you're allowing him to be mean to them in your home. That's not cool.", "YTA. I think Alex needs to be in therapy for his own mental health. I understand him being upset with Jacob at the time, but you took him in and it's been 10 years. I think Alex needs to work through his feelings with a professional. It wasn't really fair to expect someone you don't know to not panic when asked to adopt a 7 year old sibling at their first meeting/father's funeral. They don't have to have a bestie level relationship, but it's inappropriate for Alex and Nora to treat your brother and his kids like pariah and not cook enough when it's their turn. Is Jacob cruel in some way? His kids are innocent. Alex and Nora need to be parented by you a to have a conversation about acceptable behavior toward guests.", "The only thing I could think of is if the kids want to play video games, they should invest in some headphones or something to allow your brother to sleep. Other than that, your brother has some issues. Kind of hypocritical if you ask me. NTA", "YTA. The backstory doesn\u2019t really matter: Jacob is a guest in your home and your children are being horribly rude to him and his kids. Do you set no boundaries for your kids whatsoever? Why don\u2019t you talk to Alex about how to work through this feelings in a healthy way instead of lashing out at Jacob and his children?", "Aww, poor Jacob.  /s  He needs a place to stay and now he wants to throw his weight around?  He has no right.  Why should Alex or Nora accommodate him when Jacob couldn't do the same for Alex?  I can fully understand why Alex resents him, and why Alex and Nora both dislike the decision you made to house him.\n\nNTA", "Nta. Jacob is the adult so surely he can cook for himself also they're his kids... Your already outing a roof over his head and disrupting your kids. They should be allowed to be upset as they're only around for their convience", "NTA - did you promise Jacob maid / food service?  If not then he should take care of himself and his kids . Why is he still there?", "If he was getting  a  free room from strangers he couldn\u2019t be complaining . I\u2019m not sure why he feels entitled to complain now. He\u2019s the adult and they aren\u2019t . They are teenagers and they aren\u2019t being vile they are just ignoring . Josh needs to cook for his own kids . He needs to concentrate on getting them all out of your house . If he\u2019s too comfortable he will never go. You take in your two  brothers and his kids . You did your part . I\u2019m not sure what more people expect from you .", "Nta, Alex is literally living with the man who would have seen him end up in the system. Now this man is benefiting from a familial kindness that he refused to show Alex. Screw him.", "I'm petty, so NTA", "NTA - Jacob is acting entitled here.", "NTA.  Why are your kids making food for Jacob and his kids? Does he really think that the brother he abandoned owes him anything?  If he wants to live without judgement, he needs to find a place of his own or figure out a way to sincerely apologize for his past actions and follow up with strong action.", "NTA for the most part; granted telling the kids to play their games quieter would be a reasonable request on Jacob\u2019s part but I don\u2019t understand all of these comments acting like he should be cooked for and stuff like that. He\u2019s a grown ass man who\u2019s being given a place to stay; he\u2019s not owed anything with this arrangement, if anything he\u2019s the one who should be pitching in to earn his keep", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also, keeping yiur kids happy isn't always a good thing. They also need to learn how to treat people and how to manage their disappoint in life.", "Standing by and letting this escalate is why YTA. The question wasn't if Jacob is TA, you asked if you were TA. You seem to think that if Jacob did something wrong, you can't also be TA...You can both be TA. \n\nSo, Alex is unhappy, as you pointed out and you choose to do nothing. Your goal is your kids happiness and your path is to do nothing. When a kid is lashing out, they aren't happy. The simplest strategy is to talk with them, you're the only one who suggested punishing. \n\nTalking to Alex would move you to NTA. This isn't about Jacob, this is about Alex and his needs that you're ignoring. Alex is clearly needing attention, ignoring him isn't going to make him happy. \n\nBest of luck, I'm hoping that Alex can get the attention he's clearly wanting. 10 years is a long time to be angry.", "If he's been upset for a decade he needs to work through some stuff. Therapy will give him the tools he needs in life. Sounds like you just let him terrorize anyone in his path, so you could likely benefit from some parenting lessons.", "Why do you condone this behavior? Jacob did not feel capable of taking on a 7 year old at 25 years old. Had you had Alex in proper therapy for the last decade he would know that it wasn't done it harm him and it likely helped him. Jacob's kids haven't done anything wrong to either of your children yet you find it acceptable for them to treat them poorly as well.", "Why are you ok with them trying to make his life hell?", "No, it doesn't, because there are basic standards of decency for how you treat a guest in your home. A decent parent ensures their children abide by them.", "Hopefully Alex and Nora won't treat you like they've treated Jacob.  But I understand.", "Yeah man, and like, I remember being a total angsty emotional wreck at 17 and I didn't have an absent brother show up randomly and invade my space with his kids... so yeah I mean the behaviour of them ignoring Jacob and his kids, being generally obnoxious with blasting video games late at night isn't great... honestly? I don't know if I would be able to \"punish\" them for it as a parent. I think some real deep conversations and soul searching as a family is needed here to move forward.", "Jacob is able to leave. He is not a hostage. He needs to just act like it is a rented room and be appreciative that it is free. Therapy takes a long time and I\u2019m guessing this is a temporary situation. Not every relationship needs or deserves to be fixed. Alex may even be leaving for college soon.", "He is a perfectly nice kid. He has a right to be upset. Jacob left him and hardly ever contacted him and didn't even apologize. If he had apologized Alex wouldn't be upset a decade later.\n\nI talked to Alex and according to him he is treating Jacob exactly as Jacob treated him, just ignore. I'm not happy with the way they behave but I understand it", "He already had a 7 yo at 25 so I'd say he was pretty capable\n\nI don't think forcing my kids to spend time with them will have a better outcome", "They are just kids having fun", "A decent parent questions why their kid is lashing out and works to figure out how to best solve it. They don\u2019t force their kids to do something they clearly have a huge problem with. Basic standards by who? You and what you think is basic?", "OP has done Alex a disservice by continuing to let him struggle with feelings of abandonment and resentment and not understand nuance in the situation. Jacob is apparently not currently able to leave and while he's there he and his kids should expect basic respect and decency. He doesn't have to tolerate shitty or cruel behavior for a place to stay after OP said he could stay.", "He's not adjusted and needs to be parented. He's not a nice kid if he's acting like a terrorist to kids in a hard place and a jerk to your other brother. He needed to work through things a decade ago.", "Why do you think that having a child automatically means that  one can adopt another child?", "You don't need to force them to spend time with them. You do need to tell them that they shouldn't be seeking out to \"make his life hell.\" That means not yelling and being loud in the middle of the night, being civil, cordial and kind, and generally not acting spoiled and entitled all the time.   \nSo your brother had a child at 18 years old. He knew he couldn't handle two. And that is okay. He was allowed to set that boundary. \n\nAnd again, Alex would understand that had he been in therapy and been parented for the last decade.", "No they are assholes who are trying to make someone's life hell for not having adopted Alex 10 years ago (even though you adopted him and your brother wasn't able - which is valid). Why do you think it's ok for them to have fun by making other's lives miserable?", "Yeah, like I said, OP should talk to Jacob about working through his feelings in a healthy way instead of lashing out.\n\nThe basic standards include being considerate of the amount of noise you're making while others are sleeping, making enough food for everyone in the home when it's your turn to cook, and saying a polite \"hello\" at minimum when you encounter the guests.", "He is living his normal life not acting like a \"terrorist\"", "It doesn't but when your little brother is going to end up in the system, you adopt him\n\nFor all he knew I wouldn't be willing to adopt a kid I've never met before", "He's literally trying to make Jacob's life hell per your admission...terroristic behavior to Jacob and his kids.", "I understand what you\u2019re saying but Jacob isn\u2019t wrong for not taking on more than he can handle. He is wrong for not staying in Alex\u2019s life. If Alex ended up in the system, it wouldn\u2019t have been Jacob\u2019s fault or your fault, it would have been your dad\u2019s fault. He\u2019s the one who chose to have a child with a woman that was no good. He also had a responsibility to arrange a guardian for Alex while he was still alive and well but he didn\u2019t do it. Parents have a responsibility to make sure that if something happens to them their minor child will be taken care of. In my opinion, there shouldn\u2019t have been a conversation about which one of you would take custody of Alex. It should have been decided long before your father\u2019s passing. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting to me that when someone passes away and doesn\u2019t have their affairs in order, family members get so angry at the people who refuse to clean up the mess and it\u2019s usually because the person who made the mess is no longer here to be angry with."]}
