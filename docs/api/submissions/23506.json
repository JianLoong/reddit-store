I mean basically she didn't want her \"imperfect\" nephew ruining the aesthetics of her perfect day, which is such a crock of manure. I would have been furious and left the wedding too. \n\nMy one suggestion to you is that you try not to add fuel to the fire and engage with people messaging you. If you feel you must, keep it vague and simple, like \"She knows what she did and it will remain between us.\" I only say this because this is one of those things you should take to the grave. Your son doesn't need to hear that someone who should love him unconditionally feels his amputation means he should be hidden away. The only good thing to come out of this is that if you are assigning guardianship in case something happens to you, you know it should never be her.", "NTA, should have told the son why the OP left the wedding and let him work it out about the aunt", "NTA \n\nYour sister is cruel and ableist", "NTA you need to tell the people messaging you what your sister did and said.\n\nAsk them if they are all right with someone discriminating against a kid with a disability.\n\nI would limit contact with your sister.

Due to this I respected her wishes and arranged childcare for my son. However at arriving I noticed over 15 children in attendance. So when I spoke to my sister, and asked why my son was not included, she said it was because.... he has an Amputated Leg!!!! and she was worried his disability would draw more attention than her on her wedding day. She excluded her OWN nephew due to having an amputated leg. I will not stand for ANY discrimination from ANYONE, least of all mine my sons own FAMILY!!!. I will stand by him always. So given that he was unwelcome at the wedding due to his disability, I didn't feel like celebrating my discriminatory and selfish sisters wedding. I could have caused a scene and expressed my anger and disapointment in her, and outed her to everyone at the wedding, but I was respectful and simply walked away quietly. If my son finds out from his cousins, or by seeing photos, that he was excluded from the wedding due to his amputation, and not because it was child free, he would be heartbroken. And it would destroy him. \nIf anyone agrees that I was out of line for leaving peacefully, and sticking by my son and not putting up with her disgusting discrimination of my son, then I will be going NC with you also. \"\n\nThen you need to tell your family how disgusted you are with your sisters behaviour, and make it clear that you will not be subjecting your son to her blatant discrimination, and you will not be allowing her to see your son anymore. And they should think about how heartbroken he would be if he found out from cousins or family (or when seeing photographs) that he was excluded because of his amputation. How that would destroy his self confidence and esteem. How it would make him feel unwanted and unworthy, and a dissappintment or disgrace of being with family at special events. That the people who are meant to love and support him the most are the very people who excluded him and didn't want him there. Let them think about that for a second before they bad mouth you for leaving. And again point out that you could have kicked off and outed her to everyone for what she did at the wedding, but instead you left quietly without saying anything. And again, reiterate that you will not be subjecting your son to being with anyone who treats him that way, and going forward you won't be subjecting your son to being around your sister again in the future, and if anyone shares her views, they can count themselves added to the list of people excluded from his life. You will not subject him that cruelness or discrimination feeling unwanted by his own family. \n\nThen do what you're doing best and be with your son, continue to uplift him and encourage him and bring joy and happiness to his life, knowing he has your support always. Go spend time together and do fun things, and put your sister and any other AH's that side with her out of your mind. \n\nYou did good Dad!", "Absolutely NTA", "NTA.", "NTA. You left more discretely than I would of done.

I will never understand all these women who need 100% attention on them at all times for the wedding day. So many wedding stories I read involve the bride excluding people or making rules for the sole purpose of them being insecure that said person or reason will draw attention away from them.\n\n Like I get it's \"your day,\" but why are they so worried about attention? So many brides are so vain and concerned about themselves. All I was worried about on my wedding day was getting to say 'I Do' to my husband and having a fun and special time with Him. I wasn't worried or concerned about anything else.  So many things went wrong or changed plans that day. But all that mattered to me was getting married to him. That's all I wanted. It didn't matter if anyone's eyes weren't on us. As long as we still got married, I was happy.\n\nI think it's incredibly cruel of your sister to do such a thing, and you did the right thing. The only reason she made a big deal out of it and let you walking out \"ruin the wedding\" is because hopefully she feels guilty and understands how wrong and selfish she was.\nDid she not think you were going to realize it wasn't actually childfree, and just forget that detail??

As if having a leg or an arm isn\u2019t traumatic enough, even for an adult, but to know that your own aunt excluded you from a major life event because of something out of your control? I\u2019m sure your son would be devastated and he has enough challenges to deal with than this. You did nothing wrong, it\u2019s all on her and I\u2019m glad her wedding got ruined anyway. Maybe her groom will see her for what she is and run for the hills. \n\nI am glad your son has you, and that you have your son.

Your sister, on the other hand, is unfortunately terribly shallow, superficial and disingenuous. She's all about appearances and has no personal depth of character.

For those family members who question your reaction, including your sister, feel free to ask them what they genuinely expected of you under the circumstances.

She treated him like an inconvenience. That she LIED to you about the wedding being childfree. That she is an ableist - someone who discriminates against/has prejudice against people with disabilities. And that you found that all out at the wedding and made the very valid choice to stand up for yourself and your son and leave. You owe her nothing at this point.
