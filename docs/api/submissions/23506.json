I mean basically she didn't want her \"imperfect\" nephew ruining the aesthetics of her perfect day, which is such a crock of manure. I would have been furious and left the wedding too. \n\nMy one suggestion to you is that you try not to add fuel to the fire and engage with people messaging you. If you feel you must, keep it vague and simple, like \"She knows what she did and it will remain between us.\" I only say this because this is one of those things you should take to the grave. Your son doesn't need to hear that someone who should love him unconditionally feels his amputation means he should be hidden away. The only good thing to come out of this is that if you are assigning guardianship in case something happens to you, you know it should never be her.", "NTA, should have told the son why the OP left the wedding and let him work it out about the aunt", "NTA \n\nYour sister is cruel and ableist", "NTA you need to tell the people messaging you what your sister did and said.\n\nAsk them if they are all right with someone discriminating against a kid with a disability.\n\nI would limit contact with your sister. It is hard to say how she treats your child when you are not around.\n\nTell your sister to call off the flying monkeys or you will make sure everyone knows what a heartless monster she actually is.", "NTA. And I will totally validate you that it is ok if you never see her the same way again. I would not be able to move past this.", "Your sister ruined the wedding.", "NTA and I'd tell everyone if they asked exactly what she said.", "NTA Frankly message each of them and call them an albeist monster, including your sister.", "I'm astounded that this isn't the only time I've read this scenario on here. Wtf is wrong with people...? NTA, obviously.", "Nta. Your sister lied to you and excluded your kid", "You are not an asshole and your sister is a fucking monster! She\u2019s a terrible aunt. I would go no contact until she apologized to my son.", "NTA... and you're a really good Dad \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nYour sister lied to you for selfish reasons. I just don't understand brides who think that people need to stop existing just for the sake of their wedding. While I  understand that it is important to keep focus on the bride and groom, there are some things that people can't control.", "NTA. And your sister is a major AS. She could have just excluded all kids under 16 for example \n\nHonestly I feel that I read a similar story or a sister excluding sister because her daughter had amputated arm.", "God, no. NTA.", "NTA and GOOD FATHER!", "Simply put NTA to the 1000%. Sister on the other hand is a giant tw**!!!!", "NTA!", "NTA. Your sister was the typical unfeeling bride.  I bless you for being a supportive and loving mom to your son.  Good luck with your sister.  My brother lived without both legs.", "NTA. I\u2019ll tell off your sister for you if you\u2019d like.  I can only imagine someone excluding my kid for that reason and the words id have for them.\n\nYou sound like a great dad. Wish you and your son well!", "NTA - This is the most obvious NTA that I\u2019ve ever given. Your sister behaved monstrously.\n\nI think that you need to let everyone exactly why you left because if they can defend that sort of behaviour, they are not worth knowing.\n\nYou defended your child and you were absolutely right to do so. Congrats on being a great parent x", "NTA-your sister is vile for excluding your son because he has an amputation.  She should be ashamed of herself. I wonder what she thought you would do or say once you found out the truth.", "Nta. You are a great father. Well done for sticking up for your son. I hope you had a great day together.\n\nIgnore absolutely anyone who sided with your sister. What a horrible thing to do.", "NTA\n\nYou're a good parent. She's a crappy sister, aunt and human being.\n\nYou may not have a lot of people to support you, but you have a whole community here who stand wit you and the kiddo. Your son has worth and value and doesn't need to do anything to prove himself or earn that. Your sister really messed up here. You and the kid will be alright.", "NTA", "NTA. Your sister is wrong. The family and friends who support her position are wrong. Stay strong because your son needs you. The family is clearly always going to look at him like there\u2019s something wrong with him. You and he don\u2019t need that in your lives.", "NTA.\nYour sister is, though. And I bet the people texting you got a whole different story about what happened.", "NTA. An unbelievable act of dishonesty and cruelty, made exponentially worse due to it being at the expense of a child.", "NTA, but your sister is a massive one. I can't imagine doing something so heartless to one of my nephews..... And I don't even like some of them. \ud83e\udd23", "What your sister has done is beyond cruel. She excluded a child for aesthetic reasons. \n\nNTA .. and I'm actually thinking you should let everyone know who's blowing up your phone the full story.", "NTA. How could your sister have expected any reaction less than the one you gave? If you leaving ruined her wedding, she deserved it.", "**NTA !**   YOU didn't \"ruin\" the wedding; your sister ruined her experience by her self-entitlement and desire to be the \"only\" possible focus of attention.  Let her stew in her own shame.  And respond to the messages suggesting that you \"caused\" your sister to cry with the facts:  your sister excluded her disabled nephew from her wedding because she didn't want to take the chance that anyone would take their eyes off of her.  Add, that her decisions was very, very hurtful to you and you are ashamed of her behavior.", "NTA unless there is more to it like you use it for attention and she felt like it would distract from her day. I would be interested to hear her side bc there is something missing here.", "It's pretty ironic that she didn't invite your son because he would draw attention at the wedding, but then her action caused her wedding to be \"ruined\" anyway because you did the right thing and left when you found out.\n\nI agree with the others here - let every single person messaging you know exactly why you left.  \n\nUnbelievable.  NTA", "NTA.  To be honest, I don't think reddit is who you should be asking this question of.  I think you should be asking it of the dozens of people sending you messages right now.\n\n\"My sister told me the wedding was child free when it wasn't.  When I asked her why my son was excluded, she said it was because he is an amputee and she didn't want people to pay attention to him.  I frankly just couldn't enjoy the wedding after that and wanted to be with my son.\"\n\nfeel free to copy-paste that.\n\nI don't think her pettiness entitles her to courtesy at this point.", "OP is a guy!", "She thought once he was there he wouldn\u2019t want to cause a scene and would just be a good boy and smile and good for the day and then he\u2019d get over it.\n\nNTA. \n\n\u201cWell I went home and didn\u2019t the day trying not to cry in front of my son because of her cruelty and now our relationship is ruined. But SHE did that. She made the choice that ruined the wedding and she ruined her relationship with me. I\u2019m not open to hearing why you think what she did and said is no big deal and if you feel the need to advocate for her I\u2019ll be taking a break from you for a bit too.\u201d", "Then send the sister the link to this post so she can see what the world honestly thinks about her. \n\nYou are a way better person then me! I think o would not have left until I told the groom he better run or not have kids with her because how would she treat her child if it wasn\u2019t her definition of perfect!"]}
