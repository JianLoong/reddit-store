It sounds like her partner is also not helping her self confidence, and while you cannot tell her to leave outright, you can include options that incrementally lessens her reliance, or feelings of obligation to him. Ask, with no judgement,  where she thinks she could have done things differently and what skillsets she thinks that she was missing and brainstorm together how she can gain them.

One had her dad pass away & spiraled into depression, and the other became severely depressed, and then later in life developed schizophrenia. They both failed & had to drop out.

Also went back to edit my original comment because it was a story long. 1. So reality is I get your point fully, but how you actually went about it wasn\u2019t the best. You can tell your daughter that you want your step daughter to make her own choices regarding furthering her education without the guilt/persuasion from others simply by saying just that. 2. Your daughter made her own choices and she needs to live with them. Sure she can call you a shitty parent all she wants and be angry at her sister, but that actually isn\u2019t going to improve her situation at all. 3. Your daughter is an adult now and yes she is your daughter, but you aren\u2019t responsible for her child\u2018s safety, she and the father are. The harsh reality check is she needs to understand it is HER job and the FATHER\u2019S job to keep that child safe and provide food and shelter for said child.. Ideally they are adults and they live on their own. Whether you choose to continue to provide assistance for them or not, regardless \nthey need to start taking matters into their own hands and should be looking into the many resources/ assistant programs their location can provide them including food stamps/food help, mental health care, childcare, housing affordability, the list goes on. - Your ex husband can always chip in and help them too since he\u2019s so \u201cupset\u201d with what you said.
