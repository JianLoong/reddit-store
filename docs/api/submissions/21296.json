And tiramisu as dessert. \n\nI thought this covered all bases, had enough variety, and people seemed to enjoy it. No one went home hungry. \n\nBut my dad told me that if he knew I wouldn't be serving meat he wouldn't have come, he made a couple of snarky remarks too (especially about the salad, 'rabbit food' 'this is what real food eats' etc.). And my brother called me after to let me know his girlfriend agrees with my dad and also would want 'real' food the next time, if I'm ever hosting again. \n\nHonestly, I don't really want to host again.

To complain about it being meatless would, in my opinion, be some tacky, choosing beggar behavior.\n\nYou served \"real\" food. What utter nonsense.\n\nAnd you take your own meals to their house? Nope. They can bring their own food next time they dine with you. Don't waste your time and money feeding such ill-mannered ingrates, regardless of their relation to you. Honestly, don't dine with them at all, bad dining company can contribute to indigestion. Prioritize your health and sanity.  \n\n\nShoot... I don't even like pasta, but its not a dietary restriction so if I went to someone's home and they served a pasta dish, I'd eat it without complaint and be grateful they took the time to prepare a meal to share with me. :/", "NTA - although I believe telling guests ahead of time what I\u2019ll be serving is important.

It would be nice if you were out,got hungry and a bacon tree was nearby so you could have a snack.", "It\u2019s not that hard to find vegan tiramasu, though. I could probably walk to a nearby grocery store and pick some up. Or find thousands of easy recipes online.\n\nA thing going vegan taught me is how many people have no idea of the function of the ingredients in food. It\u2019s not particularly difficult to replace the fat or cream components of any recipe.", "That sounds fun! But we don't have that here. Usually either one person hosts and buys the groceries, or if its for a bigger group people each bring some dishes or pool money together to get stuff. Bringing food to someone's house and expecting them to cook it is unheard of.", "This is a bit different concept if guests bring something to prepare (like a potluck?) versus a dinner where the host has prepared the meal for the guests. In OPs scenario the family is not accommidating to diet restrictions (no vegetarian options) but OP does accommodate food that everyone can eat - meat is a preference for family members, not necessarity.", "My daughter is a vegetarian. When she lived at home, we observed Meatless Monday (recommended by Johns Hopkins), and I always made sure there was something she could eat at every meal, which is easy to do. Of course, now when she comes for dinner, we either pick up and everyone chooses their meal, or I make one of her favorite meatless dishes (I make a mean tuna-less noodle casserole). \n\nYou deserve the same treatment. Your family seems to have a different mindset about vegetarians. I\u2019m sorry the delicious-sounding meal you served didn\u2019t show them there are different ways to eat. \n\nI wonder how your family would behave if they were invited to dinner by someone from another country who served food different from what they are used to.", "Your family isn't complaining about the food -- they are demeaning your choices and your lifestyle. If they'd gone to an Italian restaurant and been served that meal, they would have been perfectly satisfied. It's not that they wanted different food, they wanted to make sure you know they think your choice is ridiculous and you shouldn't be living differently from them. Kind and loving people would graciously praise the food AND your independence.", "My sister is a vegetarian of 4 plus years, me and my dad are voracious carnivores and quite cruel skeptical people at times especially when we think we 'know' a person, so when my sister announced her vegetarianism we were very much '\"let's see how long it lasts\". Well like I mention her and her partner have stuck at it for over 4 years now and had us over for dinner several times all of which we've started unsure and finished our meals every single time, she goes out of her way to use extra lentils and chickpeas in the dishes she makes to add substance to almost mitigate our desire for meat. \n\nThe first time we ate she made a chickpea curry which blew me away but sarcastic me had to say; \"wow that was incredible, the only way it could be improved was with a bit of meat\" to which my dad told me that I was splitting hairs and he actually thought it was perfect and he was worried it was going to sit heavy on his stomach and asked for some to take home! I expected my dad to be a critic and had to quickly clarify I was trying to be a joker because honestly I could not recreate a dish as tasty without the use of meat and I know chickpea curry is like a vegetarian basic but I was truly impressed by her cooking, but she had always been great at it.\n\nI re-tell this story as I know in this scenario I come off as bratty, self important and almost trying to score points off my sister, upon realisation I immediately remedied it by admitting I was just busting balls because I'm a terrible cook and since we've attended every time she invites us if only to see what she makes because it's always delicious.\n\nIt's not your responsibility to cater to us, if we can't live without it we should bring it, as well as our own cooking utensils to not contaminate yours. A bit of a joke between family is great if everyone is laughing, but it sounds like you're being guilt tripped and that's awful.", "When I started dating my current girlfriend it dawned on me that I hadnt really gone to restaurants I loved or done things that are my favorite in a long time. My ex was selfish and I am very \"go-with-the-flow\" so we just always did things, and went places she wanted because I never had a hard opinion against it.", "I would not cook meat for someone because I would probably give them food poisoning. Once I put frozen chicken burgers into the oven for my husband, totally forgetting that they probably should have been defrosted first.", "It\u2019s why I don\u2019t as a veggie. My wife eats meat but knows if I am in cooking duty that evening she\u2019s having veggie. I don\u2019t want to kill her. NTA if they don\u2019t accommodate you why should they accept you to cook meat for them. You gave them dinner. More than they do for you", "I was vegetarian when my husband and I first started dating and I totally embarrassed myself trying to cook him chicken. He still refers to my medium rare chicken dinner \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02", "That's why I said IF op invites them ever again \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude02", "Haha I googled it and man you are right^^' i laughed hard on that one^^' can you maybe explain why it is called like that?", "Hypocrites!", "And I bet those same people told you that a polite guest doesn't complain about the host to her face, right?", "Then they didn\u2019t teach you to accommodate guests, they taught you to accommodate THEM", "And yet they don't accommodate your vegetarian-ism when they host you...", "Quite common around the world. In Korea, they have Korean bbq and in Thailand they have Muketa where people also bbq their own food.", "I would like to know more about this casserole.  I've got a hard to please vegetarian in my life and could use any and all help.", "Please share this tunaless noodle casserole it made me hungry just thinking about it!", "Could I get this casserole recipe?", "Chicken burgers are usually cooked from frozen. That's fine.", "OP should invite only the people that didn\u2019t complain/make threats. When they complain about being left out say, \u201cyou told me you wouldn\u2019t come if there wasn\u2019t meat so I didn\u2019t invite you. Are you changing your mind and won\u2019t insult the host who generously supplied you with dinner?\u201d", "I have no idea why it\u2019s called that. But you are right about them being delicious!", "Here in Northern Europe its not common.", "It\u2019s a tuna noodle casserole recipe from my grandmother. I eliminate the tuna and add more almond slivers. Unfortunately, I have it at home in a cook book, and I am on vacation. I\u2019ll pm you a picture this weekend, if that\u2019s okay.", "It's not the first person's casserole, but I have an amazing creamy lemon pasta that I whip out for my vegetarian friends. I know the page says parm-crusted chicken (which is also amazing if you're inclined) but the pasta side dish is truly the star of the show.\n\n[Recipe](https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/parmesan-crusted-chicken-5eb9ae9de88fa8571c5fbc7c)\n\nI've swapped the roasted tomatoes for broccoli, kale, and spinach, or just done a combo between them. You can also play with the seasoning however you like. I've done a version with Greek spices and a version with everything seasoning.", "That\u2019s so kind of you! I\u2019m on vacation and the recipe is in a cookbook at home. I\u2019ll be home this weekend and will reply with the recipe. Otherwise, I can pm it to you.", "Me too!", "Sure! I\u2019ll add it this weekend. I\u2019m on vacation and have it written down at home.", "Sooo you\u2019d be starting a new trend :)", "I'd also like to sign up for that recipe! Enjoy your vacation.", "Heck yes! I love scoring new recipes!!! Thank you so much :)", "Thanks! I\u2019m curious to see it too n"]}
