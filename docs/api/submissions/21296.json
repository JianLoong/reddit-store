And tiramisu as dessert. \n\nI thought this covered all bases, had enough variety, and people seemed to enjoy it. No one went home hungry. \n\nBut my dad told me that if he knew I wouldn't be serving meat he wouldn't have come, he made a couple of snarky remarks too (especially about the salad, 'rabbit food' 'this is what real food eats' etc.). And my brother called me after to let me know his girlfriend agrees with my dad and also would want 'real' food the next time, if I'm ever hosting again. \n\nHonestly, I don't really want to host again. I spend quite a lot of money and time on the dinner, and it's frustrating when people try to tear it down.

To complain about it being meatless would, in my opinion, be some tacky, choosing beggar behavior.\n\nYou served \"real\" food. What utter nonsense.\n\nAnd you take your own meals to their house? Nope. They can bring their own food next time they dine with you. Don't waste your time and money feeding such ill-mannered ingrates, regardless of their relation to you. Honestly, don't dine with them at all, bad dining company can contribute to indigestion. Prioritize your health and sanity.  \n\n\nShoot... I don't even like pasta, but its not a dietary restriction so if I went to someone's home and they served a pasta dish, I'd eat it without complaint and be grateful they took the time to prepare a meal to share with me. :/", "NTA - although I believe telling guests ahead of time what I\u2019ll be serving is important.

No one went home hungry. \n\nBut my dad told me that if he knew I wouldn't be serving meat he wouldn't have come, he made a couple of snarky remarks too (especially about the salad, 'rabbit food' 'this is what real food eats' etc.).
