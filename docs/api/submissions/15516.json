She mentions how last time I came to her place I asked her to put her dog in another room (nevermind it kept sniffing me and slobbering on my leg).  I told her that is very different, and i'll leave him in his playpen.  She starts arguing with me and I tell her she can leave, we can do this another time.

Under no circumstances can you just put a crawling baby in another room unsupervised! Your \u201cfriend\u201d is a nut job to think that is even in the realm of options. Your baby is nothing like her dog, your baby could actually die if left alone. \n\n\nAnd what the hell was he even doing that was so upsetting to her? Existing in her presence? She needs to get a grip.", "NTA. I'm also what one might call \"vocally childfree.\" That doesn't mean I hate children, and even if it did, that wouldn't be an excuse to be a dick to them. Just because your \"friend\" doesn't want to be a mother doesn't mean she gets to shame your choice or disrespect a fucking baby.", "NTA- being child free doesn\u2019t mean you get to demand that there be no children in your presence. She\u2019s just ridiculous.", "NTA.  Just because someone is child-free doesn't mean everyone else has to hide their children. And children aren't pets.  I mean, your baby isn't even old enough to inflict a serious bite.  (Give him another year and he'll be ready for the big time.)", "If someone told me to put my baby in another room I would ask them to put themselves outside my home. \n\nNTA and my advice is to dump that \"friend\"", "NTA a dog can be left unsupervised for a time. A puppy cannot. A young child can be left with distant supervision. A baby cannot. She should know this. I'm child-free. I don't ask my friends to put their babies up like toys they don't play with when I'm there. She could have simply asked that you make sure not to hand the baby off to her. If being that close was that bothersome to her, she should have politely expressed that you could do it another time preferably when your husband could be there to watch the baby.\n\nNo one puts baby in the corner.", "NTA your child is not a pet. Your friend is really strange to compare a baby to a dog.", "Nta.   She came to a house with a baby living there.  That's on her.", "NTA\n\nYour friend, on the other side... not for being childfree (that's her right), but because it's clear she doesn't respect you and your baby. I go so far as to say that she hates children.", "NTA.  You can't leave an awake baby unattended.  It's okay not to like kids, but your friend is ridiculous.  Kids have the right to exist, especially in their own homes.  Don't even get me started on trying to compare the child to a dog", "NTA. Infants and toddlers really shouldn't be left alone. And any experienced parent will tell you, a quiet child is one that should worry you (they're usually up to something!). If she wants to continue to be friends with you, she has to understand that your family will always come with that package.", "NTA. Was the baby sniffing her and drooling on her?  Were you bullying her into holding your baby? Demanding that she play and snuggle with the baby? Your baby sounds infinitely less intrusive than my friends chihuahua, who wouldn't stop sniffing my hair and trying to lick me. \n\n It's not just your home, its also the baby's home.\n\nBabies and children are members of society too. People who choose to be childless do not get to live in a child free world.\n\nI had this problem with my niece when I had a baby. I eventually just didn't invite her over anymore. We aren't close anymore because she treated my son very poorly due to the fact that she doesn't like small children, even though I never once asked her to hold him or feed him or play with him or interact with him at all.", "NO\n\nNTA\n\nDog verus kid, dog can be left alone for a few hours, 9 m. kid awake? Nope! You can leave him for a bathroom break, but that's it!", "Yikes. Your friend is being completely ridiculous. Your baby and the dog are two totally different situations.\n\nIf she wants to be child-free, great for her. You're not letting the baby crawl all over her or forcing her to hold your baby or anything. \n\nNTA", "Of course you were NTA. Perhaps your friendship has run its course.", "NTA. Friend definitely is. I understand pets are like family members to an extent. Difference being you can put a pet in another room unsupervised without worrying about its safety. Is this actually a friend? Or are you mutual friends of the person getting married? Because she is a huge AH & should not be considered your friend.", "NTA but I would heavily reconsider whether you want this person as your friend. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be child free (I certainly don't want a kid and have held fast to this desire my entire life) but that never gives someone the right to make demands of others who have kids just because they don't want to be around them.\n\nWhat happens when your child starts to walk around, require even more supervision from you so they don't end up getting hurt? This person can't expect you to just put your child in another room when they are around every single time or evenrually your kid is gonna realize that they have to be 'locked away' when this specific person comes over and resentment will start to build. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso a dog is very different from a child and is at a much less risk of severely harming themselves if left alone in another room for an hour compared to a HUMAN INFANT and the two situations cannot be compared to each other at all.", "Absolutely NTA. It\u2019s ridiculous of her to compare your child to her dog. Nine month old babies needs adult supervision when they are awake. Dogs don\u2019t.", "NTA what\u2019s wrong with her? A baby is not a dog.", "NTA. Your friend is, mainly for comparing your child to a dog.", "NTA\n\nWhat a terrible friend.  Your child is not a dog that you just put in the other room.", "NTA.\n\nI can't stand kids. But it's YOUR house and you absolutely have the right to have YOUR baby in the room with you.", "NTA. It's good she doesn't plan on having children because she behaved like an entitled idiot around yours. She obviously only wants childfree visits so unless you are inclined to accept that condition, don't make plans to meet up with her again. Make you plans virtually or one of you can bow out. Don't expose your child to such a cold creature in the future, he doesn't deserve the hatred.", "Oh. NTA all the way. \n\nYou can be child free and vocal about it, but you can't demand a mother leaving her 9mo baby awake, alone and unattended. \n\nDogs can be alone for hours and be fine if you take precautions like food, water, toxic stuff put away etc. Babies can harm themselves by rolling incorrectly especially at 9mo when they crawl, sit and almost stand up.", "Find a new friend", "NTA\n\nI can't stand being around babies (or dogs) but even I think your friend was out of line. If I *choose* to visit someone with a baby (or a dog) then I have to suck it up. Nobody forced them to visit you in your home. Caf\u00e9s are a thing.", "She should no longer be a friend.\n\nNTA", "Totally NTA.\nYour \u201cfriend\u201d totally the AH. Comparing the baby to her dog like it can be put away without supervision? She can\u2019t be that stupid to not know that is not OK. Childless or not.", "NTA. If she can't see how a dog and a child are different, that's her own issue.", "What the....\n\nYour kid lives there.  She doesn't.  I wouldn't let her set foot over the threshold again (though I also wouldn't have put my dog up for you,  but simply made him behave).\n\nNTA", "NTA. Not wanting kids is fine. Expecting them to evaporate is a bit unreasonable.", "NTA\n\nWas her dog a newborn puppy? That's the only way those two situations would be comparable lol. Babies will stick their fat little fingers into every death trap they can find, hell they'll figure out how to build their own if one is not provided at that age! They're lucky those fat little fingers are cute!", "NTA, put your \"friend\" on the other side of a baby gate. If she acts up, swat her nose with a rolled up newspaper and say \"bad girl\"", "NTA.\n\nI hate how some people are trying to make \"childfree\" mean \"absolutely no children around me at all times\". My wife and I are childfree - we love our nieces and nephews and play/babysit often, it's just not a good fit for us. Your friend can fuck right off.\n\nAlso, asking you to put a mobile, awake baby alone in another room?! Does she have any concept how dangerous that is, even if it a crib? Also a dog is not equal to a baby, speaking as a huge dog lover!!\n\nSounds like this friend needs to be low to no contact for a while until she gets her mindset reoriented.", "NTA. She knew, coming to your house, that there was also a baby there. Not a dog. \"Uncomfortable\"? snort. Nice when the trash takes itself out.", "NTA. You would be TA if you had put your awake nine month old in the other room. Your \"friend\" isn't childfree. She just hates children. And that's fine, but you can't go to someone's house where a baby lives and expect to have it removed from your presence. She's rude and stupid. Why are you friends with someone like this?", "Wow. I didn't know being childfree could also mean being afraid or disgusted by children in general. That's really weird. \n\nYour are NTA.", "Whaaat asking to out a baby in another room? It\u2019s not a dog. I would instantly quit the friendship. She is selfish, immature and just insane", "NTA\n\nI'm baffled by the amount of people who seem to think that 'childfree' means 'no children in my presence, ever, under any circumstances'\n\nDoes she demand that mothers with strollers get off the bus because she's 'childfree'? Or that a store kicks out any families because she shouldn't have to be subjected to the them?\n\nFFS, just because she doesn't like children doesn't give her the right to tell you what to do with yours, in your own home no less.\n\nI hate to say it, but I think this friendship is over, and honestly it's probably for the best", "NTA. I don't like kids but even I know better.", "You can't put a baby in a other room where you don't have eyes on them for any length of time. It's not safe, and it wouldn't work - the baby will start crying if it's left alone. This is a child, not a pet.", "NTA.  I'm childfree and prefer not being around kids but I wouldn't be this much of a dick about it.  The kid is nine months old and yeah, you need to be watching him, and it's probably good for his development that you not put him into a separate room like that.", "Babies are people, people. Theyre just very new very small people. You can choose not to procreate but you cannot remove all babies and children from your life. This idiot is an idiot.", "I\u2019m a dog mom, my dog is my everything. But even I know you never leave a baby unsupervised. Especially if they\u2019re crawling. Putting a dog away is nowhere near the same thing. \n\nI don\u2019t understand the weird animosity towards children, even if you\u2019re a child free person. NTA", "NTA. your child is another human being who is really vulnerable at that age its not a dog you can just take out for a while omg. she came to your house, she should\u2019ve accepted your child being there, just because she doesnt want one its so shitty to act like this..", "NTA. Anyone who can't tell a dog from a baby probably shouldn't have either - particularly if they use either to control a homeowner in their OWN HOME. Are you sure this person is \\*actually\\* your friend?", "Dog owner was lying in wait to turn the tables on you and ask you to put the baby in another room. She\u2019s a jerk. You, OP, are NTA.", "Hell no not the Ahole!!! Who compares a dog with a baby?!?!? Clearly your so called friend is the Ahole!!! Can you put the baby in the other room? Get the fuck out of here!!!!", "NTA. Your \"friend\" set this situation up as some kind of weird \"gotcha\" because she literally believes dogs are equivalent to human children. \n\nThere's happily childfree, and then there's whatever the fuck that is.", "NTA. She was being a passive-aggressive ass, still pissed that you asked her to move her dog to another room. She doesn\u2019t sound like much of a friend atm.", "NTA. What is wrong with that person?", "Literally everything changes when you have a kid, if friends aren\u2019t cool with that then they\u2019re not friends. NTA\nEdit spelling", "NTA. It sounds like your friend is jealous. Is your friend incapable of having a child, or dislikes them?", "Can't wait to see OP's friend post about how her parent friend dropped her and the comments about how all parents are selfish people who put their kids above friends. Lol", "Gross. Child free is fine, a legitimate choice for any of the reasons. \n\nAnti-child is antisocial.\n\nYou are NTA", "Your friend sounds horrid. Not everyone has to love kids or want them, but comparing them to a dog? Uh, not the same thing. \n\nNTA, time to find some new friends.", "Nta, i am childfree and definitely not a child person but I am actually a decent human being and know how to interact with babies.

I\u2019m childfree as well, however I wouldn\u2019t not be uncomfortable with a mother holding her child. Your child is a baby human, not an animal you can just shut in another room. That\u2019s incredibly weird your \u201cfriend\u201d expects you to do so.", "So completely NTA. Your \"friend\" sounds selfish and awful. You are in your own house, and your child is a human being. She thinks your human child has less value than a dog. Yikes. I wouldn't spend time with that one anymore.", "NTA. You need a better friend.", "NTA for sure. I am child free and dislike children but never ever would I ask someone to put their baby into a different room unsupervised. I don't know much about baby's but that would go against all common sense and logic. Esp the comparison to her dog is weird.\nSeems like she is mad at you for having a kid.

Her behavior is so unbelievably wrong.", "NTA but your friend should be an ex friend", "NTA\n\nYour \"friend\" has been mad since you asked for her doggie-child to be put in a different room. \n\nShe was begging for a conflict, and created one in order to have her moment.

I am childfree, but he is a 9 month old baby. And you can\u2019t compare baby with a dog! What the fuck?", "There is something wrong with your friend if she is uncomfortable simply being around someone with a baby.

Let's just say you have a dog instead of a baby.\n\nHere is why your request was reasonable, and hers wasn't:\n\nHer dog was touching you and getting their spit all over you. This dog was not contained, and you asked for this dog to be contained so it couldn't get their spit all over you. Your \"dog\" was contained in a pen and incapable of slobbering all over your friend's legs, even if they were in the same room.\n\nNow let's remember that as much as dogs are humankind's best friend, they are not, in fact, human, and remember that your friend is an asshole.", "NTA. Holy crap. I'm \"vocally childfree\" too, but this is a whole different thing. This is bonkers behavior. If you are holding your son or he is in the playpen, what could her objection possibly be? She needs some therapy to work on her phobia of tiny humans!", "I'm  childfree and wouldn't wanna someone to hand me a baby , so I'm not a huge fan of interacting with kids .

It was definitely what i needed as a new mom and friends like you are worth their weight in gold.", "Not OP, I meant to respond to the Dad who attributes his loss of friends to jealousy.", "I\u2019ll take happy baby yelling and shrieking over crying any day. I have fond memories of my daughter \u201ccrowing\u201d in the grocery store.", "Dog sniffing is okay, it\u2019s how they learn people. If in a dog household and you don\u2019t like it, leave.", "I think, too, there's something perfectly acceptable in saying \"hey, I know I don't have a kiddo to bring to play dates, but if you're cool having me around during them, I'd love to catch up with you all\".  \n\n\nProvided, of course, that there's an understanding that playdates are always going to be a somewhat distracted catch-up because the parents are, well, parenting. But I've never had someone say no to that - they're normally surprised because they just assume I wouldn't *want* to do that.", "As a child free woman, I have learned friendships change as we grow.  Some have made it through the years of them having kids and now grandkids and others have not.  It is a two-way street.  Things like my getting to travel and they take the kids camping.  My having a fun car while she drove the soccer mom minivan.  Stop dragging me for my life.  I do not drag you for having family.", "I completely relate to this. I\u2019m childfree by choice and am lucky that 3 of my closest friends are in the same boat, but there\u2019s a couple of others I\u2019m close with that have had kids and I\u2019m so glad that now we\u2019re all just about to hit 40 that those friendships have survived too.", "But why wouldn\u2019t you be invited to the babes bday parties \ud83d\ude22", "I\u2019d say 9 times out of 10 I\u2019m happy to hang out with  my friends and their kids. I love them and have a good \u201cAuntie\u201d like relationship with them. I have no issues with children in general, I\u2019ve just chosen not to have my own for many reasons. \n\n\nOccasionally though I\u2019d like to spend time with my friends without their kids. For example, I\u2019m going to the beach in June with 3 of my girlfriends. Two of them have young children and are thinking about bringing them. I haven\u2019t asked them not to, I\u2019m letting it be their choice, but I\u2019m secretly hoping they don\u2019t. As much as I love them, I know it will be more fun for everyone (including their moms) if they aren\u2019t there. Taking a toddler to the beach is a lot of work.", "I don't have kids but I like other people's kids.  Now, if all we do when we spend time together is kids stuff, that gets old. But I will do a few kid related stuff for an adult evening.", "This is how my child free friends are, and I adore them for it. I couldn\u2019t imagine them comparing my baby to a dog and wanting it \u201cput away.\u201d", "Me too. I bawled my eyes out from joy when I found out my bestie was pregnant, and cried even harder when the kiddo was born. I love hanging out with them. I\u2019m good on having my own kids but I would jump in front of a bullet for that little girl. Babysitting her and helping out nurtures what little maternal instinct I do have in a really fulfilling way.", "Right? If your bestie doesn\u2019t love your kid as much as they love you, they\u2019re not your bestie.", "Are you serious right now? Grow up. Life changes and so do priorities.", "Lol, yeah not sure I follow you here...\n\nMost days, I\u2019m happy just to survive the day, let alone do anything for me! I have a 4 year old, just the one, and I\u2019ve stopped counting all the grey hairs since I became a dad. \n\nBalance is great In theory, but kids will absolutely suck you dry of any remnant of your youth! Don\u2019t get me wrong, I LOOOOOOVE my son, but he\u2019s a full time commitment. My really good friends are still around, we just only see each other a few times a year and that\u2019s ok.\n\nStill the best damn thing that ever happened to me! 10/10", "Puke. Dogs aren't babies.", "Obvi you are an anti baby person or just really immature but babies and dogs are different. Two completely different situations. I hope you have a great day and find a medical professional who can help you with this case of massive stick up your ass.", "Myself and my family talk to my dogs, but we talk to them like actual people and not that god awful baby talk.  Heck we don\u2019t even use baby talk on the actual baby, in my opinion it slows down their ability to speak properly - or it just weirds my nibbling right out, like why is this person yelling in my face talking jibberish? \n\nOne time I was talking to my dog about how he wasn\u2019t allowed to just run out the door like a maniac when I\u2019m trying to get him to the backyard (he\u2019ll take off and won\u2019t come back till hours later, I also live in a very small isolated village so it\u2019s usually fine). And he\u2019ll \u201cglare\u201d at me and talk back while putting his paw on my knee to try prove his point. He can argue back for a good while. \n\nAlso, how long had you been holding that crusty poop in your hand before it clicked? Lmfao", "My son is 12 and still barges in to use the toilet while im in the bath. My daughter is 5 and she literally sits on the edge of the bath to have a conversation with me while i pee, sometimes asks to check my poop but thats a whole other level of child weirdness \ud83e\udd26", "I'm confused, why wouldn't just take the kids when they meet their friends? Why would someone not want to go hang out with friends just cause a kid is around? When I was a kid I would just spend time with my parents childless friends like they would come to my birthdays cause they felt like my friends too. Is this like a culture thing?", "Agreed. Those who\u2019ve been friends long-term were friends regardless of anything else going on, ones that made an effort to stay involved in my life and I did the same.", "I had friends who literally got mad at me for going on international vacations because it \"wasn't fair\" to them.  I told them life is all about choices.  you chose to have a child, which changed your life. I don't have children so my life is different.  \n\nOne FORMER friend said that as a childless person, I should make a lower salary and provide $$ to friends with kids so their life would improve.", "As a very involved parent, I wouldn't mind my friend asking if they could just see me. It might not be possible! But I totally get it.", "Honestly, why don\u2019t you ask? Frame it as like a hey how about you ask husbands to watch the kids so you can relax? Make it about them catching a break and being able to chill, and have some girl talk. Might be a better angle? Then it\u2019s not about you, but about them", "I\u2019m also a fan of chaos so littles, monsters, whatever little devil you got I\u2019ll always be down to letting them mix things up!", "And all of my friends kids are the best kids!  They so kind and smart and actually listen to you when you talk to them.  I\u2019ve met some demon kids and those of my friends are definitely not them.", "Babies don\u2019t sniff your crotch.", "I don't know your dog. But  I love your dog. \n\nLuckily that poop was mostly fiber. And more like a nice solid little rabbit turd lol. Didn't even leave a (visible) mark on my hand (my soul on the other hand may never recover lol). \n\nI do actually baby talk to my cats. But usually only when they've pissed me off so much I've been contemplating kicking them (I never have).\n\n-who da sweet widdle turd face? G'awww are you my widdle demon child? Did baby-pwecious knock over da garbage again! My sweeeeet widdle shit!", "That's disgusting of that person and a gigantic wtf. Good for you for leaving them in the dust.", "My former best friend from HS would send me the list of the school supplies that her kids needed saying that since I work a corporate job for a major retailer (discount) and have a good income it would not be any issue for me to get the supplies as well as clothes and shoes.  This is why she is a former friend.", "I\u2019ve got 4 kids.  It is indeed not relaxing at all to take small kids to the beach. \n\nIf you know the husbands of your friends, you should try to rope them in on the plan. Tell them you\u2019d love if they could help give their wives a day off to relax."]}
