She mentions how last time I came to her place I asked her to put her dog in another room (nevermind it kept sniffing me and slobbering on my leg).  I told her that is very different, and i'll leave him in his playpen.  She starts arguing with me and I tell her she can leave, we can do this another time.

Under no circumstances can you just put a crawling baby in another room unsupervised! Your \u201cfriend\u201d is a nut job to think that is even in the realm of options. Your baby is nothing like her dog, your baby could actually die if left alone. \n\n\nAnd what the hell was he even doing that was so upsetting to her? Existing in her presence? She needs to get a grip.", "NTA. I'm also what one might call \"vocally childfree.\" That doesn't mean I hate children, and even if it did, that wouldn't be an excuse to be a dick to them. Just because your \"friend\" doesn't want to be a mother doesn't mean she gets to shame your choice or disrespect a fucking baby.", "NTA- being child free doesn\u2019t mean you get to demand that there be no children in your presence. She\u2019s just ridiculous.", "NTA.  Just because someone is child-free doesn't mean everyone else has to hide their children. And children aren't pets.  I mean, your baby isn't even old enough to inflict a serious bite.  (Give him another year and he'll be ready for the big time.)", "If someone told me to put my baby in another room I would ask them to put themselves outside my home. \n\nNTA and my advice is to dump that \"friend\"", "NTA a dog can be left unsupervised for a time. A puppy cannot. A young child can be left with distant supervision. A baby cannot. She should know this. I'm child-free. I don't ask my friends to put their babies up like toys they don't play with when I'm there. She could have simply asked that you make sure not to hand the baby off to her. If being that close was that bothersome to her, she should have politely expressed that you could do it another time preferably when your husband could be there to watch the baby.\n\nNo one puts baby in the corner.", "NTA your child is not a pet. Your friend is really strange to compare a baby to a dog.", "Nta.   She came to a house with a baby living there.  That's on her.", "NTA\n\nYour friend, on the other side... not for being childfree (that's her right), but because it's clear she doesn't respect you and your baby. I go so far as to say that she hates children.", "NTA.  You can't leave an awake baby unattended.  It's okay not to like kids, but your friend is ridiculous.  Kids have the right to exist, especially in their own homes.  Don't even get me started on trying to compare the child to a dog", "NTA. Infants and toddlers really shouldn't be left alone. And any experienced parent will tell you, a quiet child is one that should worry you (they're usually up to something!). If she wants to continue to be friends with you, she has to understand that your family will always come with that package.", "NTA. Was the baby sniffing her and drooling on her?  Were you bullying her into holding your baby? Demanding that she play and snuggle with the baby? Your baby sounds infinitely less intrusive than my friends chihuahua, who wouldn't stop sniffing my hair and trying to lick me. \n\n It's not just your home, its also the baby's home.\n\nBabies and children are members of society too. People who choose to be childless do not get to live in a child free world.\n\nI had this problem with my niece when I had a baby. I eventually just didn't invite her over anymore. We aren't close anymore because she treated my son very poorly due to the fact that she doesn't like small children, even though I never once asked her to hold him or feed him or play with him or interact with him at all.", "NO\n\nNTA\n\nDog verus kid, dog can be left alone for a few hours, 9 m. kid awake? Nope! You can leave him for a bathroom break, but that's it!", "Yikes. Your friend is being completely ridiculous. Your baby and the dog are two totally different situations.\n\nIf she wants to be child-free, great for her. You're not letting the baby crawl all over her or forcing her to hold your baby or anything. \n\nNTA", "Of course you were NTA. Perhaps your friendship has run its course.", "NTA. Friend definitely is. I understand pets are like family members to an extent. Difference being you can put a pet in another room unsupervised without worrying about its safety. Is this actually a friend? Or are you mutual friends of the person getting married? Because she is a huge AH & should not be considered your friend.", "NTA but I would heavily reconsider whether you want this person as your friend. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be child free (I certainly don't want a kid and have held fast to this desire my entire life) but that never gives someone the right to make demands of others who have kids just because they don't want to be around them.\n\nWhat happens when your child starts to walk around, require even more supervision from you so they don't end up getting hurt? This person can't expect you to just put your child in another room when they are around every single time or evenrually your kid is gonna realize that they have to be 'locked away' when this specific person comes over and resentment will start to build. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso a dog is very different from a child and is at a much less risk of severely harming themselves if left alone in another room for an hour compared to a HUMAN INFANT and the two situations cannot be compared to each other at all.", "Absolutely NTA. It\u2019s ridiculous of her to compare your child to her dog. Nine month old babies needs adult supervision when they are awake. Dogs don\u2019t.", "NTA what\u2019s wrong with her? A baby is not a dog.", "NTA. Your friend is, mainly for comparing your child to a dog.", "NTA\n\nWhat a terrible friend.  Your child is not a dog that you just put in the other room.", "NTA.\n\nI can't stand kids. But it's YOUR house and you absolutely have the right to have YOUR baby in the room with you.", "NTA. It's good she doesn't plan on having children because she behaved like an entitled idiot around yours. She obviously only wants childfree visits so unless you are inclined to accept that condition, don't make plans to meet up with her again. Make you plans virtually or one of you can bow out. Don't expose your child to such a cold creature in the future, he doesn't deserve the hatred.", "Oh. NTA all the way. \n\nYou can be child free and vocal about it, but you can't demand a mother leaving her 9mo baby awake, alone and unattended. \n\nDogs can be alone for hours and be fine if you take precautions like food, water, toxic stuff put away etc. Babies can harm themselves by rolling incorrectly especially at 9mo when they crawl, sit and almost stand up.", "Find a new friend", "NTA\n\nI can't stand being around babies (or dogs) but even I think your friend was out of line. If I *choose* to visit someone with a baby (or a dog) then I have to suck it up. Nobody forced them to visit you in your home. Caf\u00e9s are a thing.", "She should no longer be a friend.\n\nNTA", "Totally NTA.\nYour \u201cfriend\u201d totally the AH. Comparing the baby to her dog like it can be put away without supervision? She can\u2019t be that stupid to not know that is not OK. Childless or not.", "NTA. If she can't see how a dog and a child are different, that's her own issue.", "What the....\n\nYour kid lives there.  She doesn't.  I wouldn't let her set foot over the threshold again (though I also wouldn't have put my dog up for you,  but simply made him behave).\n\nNTA", "NTA. Not wanting kids is fine. Expecting them to evaporate is a bit unreasonable.", "NTA\n\nWas her dog a newborn puppy? That's the only way those two situations would be comparable lol. Babies will stick their fat little fingers into every death trap they can find, hell they'll figure out how to build their own if one is not provided at that age! They're lucky those fat little fingers are cute!", "NTA, put your \"friend\" on the other side of a baby gate. If she acts up, swat her nose with a rolled up newspaper and say \"bad girl\"", "NTA.\n\nI hate how some people are trying to make \"childfree\" mean \"absolutely no children around me at all times\". My wife and I are childfree - we love our nieces and nephews and play/babysit often, it's just not a good fit for us. Your friend can fuck right off.\n\nAlso, asking you to put a mobile, awake baby alone in another room?! Does she have any concept how dangerous that is, even if it a crib? Also a dog is not equal to a baby, speaking as a huge dog lover!!\n\nSounds like this friend needs to be low to no contact for a while until she gets her mindset reoriented.", "NTA. She knew, coming to your house, that there was also a baby there. Not a dog. \"Uncomfortable\"? snort. Nice when the trash takes itself out.", "NTA. You would be TA if you had put your awake nine month old in the other room. Your \"friend\" isn't childfree. She just hates children. And that's fine, but you can't go to someone's house where a baby lives and expect to have it removed from your presence. She's rude and stupid. Why are you friends with someone like this?", "Wow. I didn't know being childfree could also mean being afraid or disgusted by children in general. That's really weird. \n\nYour are NTA.", "Whaaat asking to out a baby in another room? It\u2019s not a dog. I would instantly quit the friendship. She is selfish, immature and just insane", "NTA\n\nI'm baffled by the amount of people who seem to think that 'childfree' means 'no children in my presence, ever, under any circumstances'\n\nDoes she demand that mothers with strollers get off the bus because she's 'childfree'? Or that a store kicks out any families because she shouldn't have to be subjected to the them?\n\nFFS, just because she doesn't like children doesn't give her the right to tell you what to do with yours, in your own home no less.\n\nI hate to say it, but I think this friendship is over, and honestly it's probably for the best", "NTA. I don't like kids but even I know better.", "You can't put a baby in a other room where you don't have eyes on them for any length of time. It's not safe, and it wouldn't work - the baby will start crying if it's left alone. This is a child, not a pet.", "NTA.  I'm childfree and prefer not being around kids but I wouldn't be this much of a dick about it.  The kid is nine months old and yeah, you need to be watching him, and it's probably good for his development that you not put him into a separate room like that.", "Babies are people, people. Theyre just very new very small people. You can choose not to procreate but you cannot remove all babies and children from your life. This idiot is an idiot.", "I\u2019m a dog mom, my dog is my everything. But even I know you never leave a baby unsupervised. Especially if they\u2019re crawling. Putting a dog away is nowhere near the same thing. \n\nI don\u2019t understand the weird animosity towards children, even if you\u2019re a child free person. NTA", "NTA. your child is another human being who is really vulnerable at that age its not a dog you can just take out for a while omg. she came to your house, she should\u2019ve accepted your child being there, just because she doesnt want one its so shitty to act like this..", "NTA. Anyone who can't tell a dog from a baby probably shouldn't have either - particularly if they use either to control a homeowner in their OWN HOME. Are you sure this person is \\*actually\\* your friend?", "Dog owner was lying in wait to turn the tables on you and ask you to put the baby in another room. She\u2019s a jerk. You, OP, are NTA.", "Hell no not the Ahole!!! Who compares a dog with a baby?!?!? Clearly your so called friend is the Ahole!!! Can you put the baby in the other room? Get the fuck out of here!!!!", "NTA. Your \"friend\" set this situation up as some kind of weird \"gotcha\" because she literally believes dogs are equivalent to human children. \n\nThere's happily childfree, and then there's whatever the fuck that is.", "NTA. She was being a passive-aggressive ass, still pissed that you asked her to move her dog to another room. She doesn\u2019t sound like much of a friend atm.", "NTA. What is wrong with that person?", "Literally everything changes when you have a kid, if friends aren\u2019t cool with that then they\u2019re not friends. NTA\nEdit spelling", "NTA. It sounds like your friend is jealous. Is your friend incapable of having a child, or dislikes them?", "Can't wait to see OP's friend post about how her parent friend dropped her and the comments about how all parents are selfish people who put their kids above friends. Lol", "Gross. Child free is fine, a legitimate choice for any of the reasons. \n\nAnti-child is antisocial.\n\nYou are NTA", "Your friend sounds horrid. Not everyone has to love kids or want them, but comparing them to a dog? Uh, not the same thing. \n\nNTA, time to find some new friends.", "Nta, i am childfree and definitely not a child person but I am actually a decent human being and know how to interact with babies.

I\u2019m childfree as well, however I wouldn\u2019t not be uncomfortable with a mother holding her child. Your child is a baby human, not an animal you can just shut in another room. That\u2019s incredibly weird your \u201cfriend\u201d expects you to do so.", "So completely NTA. Your \"friend\" sounds selfish and awful. You are in your own house, and your child is a human being. She thinks your human child has less value than a dog. Yikes. I wouldn't spend time with that one anymore.", "NTA. You need a better friend.", "NTA for sure. I am child free and dislike children but never ever would I ask someone to put their baby into a different room unsupervised. I don't know much about baby's but that would go against all common sense and logic. Esp the comparison to her dog is weird.\nSeems like she is mad at you for having a kid.

Her behavior is so unbelievably wrong.", "NTA but your friend should be an ex friend", "NTA\n\nYour \"friend\" has been mad since you asked for her doggie-child to be put in a different room. \n\nShe was begging for a conflict, and created one in order to have her moment.

Let's just say you have a dog instead of a baby.\n\nHere is why your request was reasonable, and hers wasn't:\n\nHer dog was touching you and getting their spit all over you. This dog was not contained, and you asked for this dog to be contained so it couldn't get their spit all over you. Your \"dog\" was contained in a pen and incapable of slobbering all over your friend's legs, even if they were in the same room.\n\nNow let's remember that as much as dogs are humankind's best friend, they are not, in fact, human, and remember that your friend is an asshole.", "NTA. Holy crap. I'm \"vocally childfree\" too, but this is a whole different thing. This is bonkers behavior. If you are holding your son or he is in the playpen, what could her objection possibly be? She needs some therapy to work on her phobia of tiny humans!", "I'm  childfree and wouldn't wanna someone to hand me a baby , so I'm not a huge fan of interacting with kids .

Not gonna lie I\u2019m in that group. I\u2019m childfree for a reason, I don\u2019t like kids. I don\u2019t want to hang out with my friends kids. I\u2019m not going to be mean to kids, but I don\u2019t want to spend my time with friends around kids. I know my friends have kids, and I dont resent that, everyone makes their own choices. So if I have a choice, yeah I\u2019m gonna avoid kids.", "I've got a friend since childhood that uninvited me from her house once I told her I'd have my kids when I come hang out all because her kids weren't there and she didn't want to be around kids at all.", "Thats nuts.  As a parent that is the tradeoff and heck, Im glad someone gets to travel.", "You guys are so lucky to have Bluey. We got Thomas, In the Night Garden (a weird, weird, weird little show) and The Wiggles. Still have a thing about Greg Wiggle.", "Yes, 'those child free folks'. I neither have nor want kids myself so joined a couple of the subs and, whilst often amusing and sometimes interesting there's so much anger in there that I just don't get.\n\nI work shifts so am often free in the daytime, so I'll suggest an afternoon and make it clear that I expect the kids to be there (I'm free Wednesday, where's good for you and kid? What fits around naptime? Etc). It's not that hard if you actually want to see your friends.\n\nOn the flip side, if they have a sitter available, they're very excited to arrange a kid-free evening and have a proper catch up.", "Yeah this weird new thing where you get to be outwardly awkward and sometimes downright abusive to children because you choose not to have them is strange. Like it shouldn\u2019t be a confrontation at all. It\u2019s a human. What is the issue here? I feel like baseline common courtesy is getting lost in personal preference. \n\nAnd often at \u201cplay dates\u201d with small kids I agree that the catching up is distracted if not disjointed. Never really finishing a thought and for someone that\u2019s not also going through that it could be very frustrating. I wouldn\u2019t exclude them, but I\u2019d be honest in that you\u2019re welcome to come, but don\u2019t feel obligated to continue if you get frustrated. I can see feeling very ignored if you\u2019re truly trying to catch up while the parents are trying to half listen half keep their kid for falling off a cliff.", "I have childless friends that were always welcome to birthday parties and casual get togethers.  An extended family of people you choose can include childless adults.  Shocker!", "I'm not gonna lie, I have done this too. Sometimes you need silence or just an adult voice. Some get over stimulated with the higher octave of a child's voice (my issue) or crying.", "What the actual fuck. People are entitled as hell are they. I could imagine asking a friend who gets a discount at a major retailer something like; \"Hey friend! School shopping is coming up and kiddo needs XYZ, would you mind picking it up for me with your discount/can I use your discount\" and then venmoing them or something for picking it up for me. But to ask someone to pay for it too? AND go out of their way to get it for you?? Idk. Next level crazy.", "It's a true gift you have! I always felt guilty when my kids were little and other mom's loved all children and I'm over here like \"can somebody please come get their kid?\"", "NTA. How can you compare an actual human baby to a freaking dog?", "NTA. When did being child free mean you can\u2019t stand to be around children? I thought that just meant that you didn\u2019t want to have children of your own? I\u2019m confused as to what your friend was thinking coming to your house where she knows a baby lives. After she brought up the dog I would have laughed right in her face.", "Haha no this is insane. Nta. I'm all for dogs being fur babies but there is a difference between a trained adult dog being alone in a room for a little while vs an awake baby alone in a room. The latter is unsafe or abusive. The first is just lees mice for the dog (provided they're not the type of dog who prefers to avoid company in the first place).", "You beat me too it!!", "Lord almighty. I'm not a fan of children myself, but even I wouldn't ask a friend to park her 9 month old in a completely different room unsupervised. That person is insane and shouldn't be around children.", "I feel like Childfree is the wrong term for this kind of behavior. Childfree is, as I understand it, people who don't want children of their own. Which is great. It's amazing when people know they don't want to be parents and so don't accidentally end up being shitty parents. Even if they'd be good parents, it's great they can decide it's not for them. \n\nThis kind of behavior though, is more childphobic in the same way people are homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, etc... And should in general be given about the same level of leniency(none) if they start treating human beings as less than human based on arbitrary criteria.\n\nSo yeah, not getting why anybody would keep this person around.", "Seriously. NTA", "I mean most of the AITA stories are probably made up for clout or entertainment purposes but sadly child-hating people who would behave like this are very much real. The way so many people talk about and act towards children is really shocking.", "This seems like a setup. It feels like she acted that way because you asked her to put her dog away at her home. \n\nDoes she call her dog her child?\n\nI'm not bashing on people who do. I love my pets like my children. But, there is a difference between pets and humans.", "Dog babies and people babies are different.  Even a gentle dog can snap if their tail is pulled.  Human babies are just figuring out life.", "Exactly. I'm also childfree, but I do love having pets. I feel nurturing toward them, and my mom says it's similar to parental love, but it's not the same thing. If let's were the same as human babies, childfree people would not be having them! \n\nI get annoyed when people ask me to lock my boy up in a other room, because he's entirely uninterested in non-family and after a perfunctory sniff he leaves people alone. That being said, if someone is scared of dogs or sth I'll still keep him in my room. If someone needs me to lock up my nephew (he's 3 now) I would 100% kick that person out.", "I feel like it's become shorthand for \"We're better than the stupid breeders\", and it's getting old AF.", "Hi, I'm someone who both does not want childen and absolutely despise being around them. This dislike goes back to even my own childhood when I thought babies just were ugly, boring, flesh lumps and couldn't comprehend why anyone would like or want to be around them. The older I got, the higher the age bar I was able to tolerate became and at 37, those feelings are not likely to change anytime soon.\n\nAs a general concept, I want children to be well loved, well cared for, and well educated so they can grow up to become well adjusted adults. But I do not want them anywhere near me because I don't have the patience to deal with them. I also don't have the patience to deal with adults who act like children, so it is kinda more that I find ignorant or immature behaviors to be incredibly frustrating. I can put up with such individuals for short periods of time and be polite while I do it, but I will be screaming internally the whole time. \n\nThis is a me thing though, so I don't force other people to bend around my preferences concerning matters I have no control in. For instance, children are banned from my home, but I would not demand children be removed from someone else's residence just because I showed up. I would like to know if some event will have children present so I can opt out of going, but that is pretty much as far as I'd expect of someone else catering to my dislike of children.\n\nLuckily for me, it's been pretty easy living a child free child-free life. I'm an only child and my SO's brother doesn't plan to have kids, so no nieces or nephews to worry about. Nearly all my friends I've had since high school do not have kids and are not likely to in the future. Most of the friends I made in the many years since also do not have kids (or all their kids are adults). And of the very few friends who do have younger kids, they see the events I host as a special night out for themselves when they can make it happen. \n\nThat all said, it looks like the OP and her friend are either going to have readjust how they manage their friendship or just let the friendship drift apart. The child-free friend was a bit of an AH for demanding the kid be put in another room. She should have been aware a child could be in her presence and suggested they work on planning over VoIP instead so neither party risked having some personal boundary crossed. One can hope she now knows better and realizes she was out of line for not accepting OP's choice to not put her kid in another room after she's had a chance to cool off. Also, while OP is NTA in this instance, she should be careful to not take a verdict of NTA as an invalidation of child-free friend's wish to not be around children, because that will sure as hell would just contribute to the implosion of this friendship. In short both parties need to talk it out, respect each other's feelings, and figure out if/how their friendship will work going forward before this all turns into some kind major drama within their social circle.", "In my experience, the distance was caused by a lack of things to talk about or do together anymore. I wasn't jealous of my friends who had kids. I was happy for them, and I liked their kids well enough. But the conversations all ended up being about their kids. And I mean ALL. After some time, I realized that they know basically nothing of what I've been up to the past months, even though I occasionally try to steer the conversation into non-kid topics. However, I did know  everything about their children's lives, so that was ironic. \n\nI understand their need for family-centered activities, so I organize things that are kid-friendly and invite them to family outings that we all enjoy. But nothing else is acceptable. We no longer did anything unless the kid could be there, and there's zero interest in doing stuff we used to do together. Nothing wild like clubbing. Just normal things that would sometimes require a babysitter. I also noticed that they preferred to talk to and spend time with other parents. And I often hear things like \"You dont know love unless you have a child,\" \"You'll change your mind someday,\" etc. So I ended up gravitating to people who don't make me feel invisible or invalidate my life decisions.\n\nIt's very common and I've accepted it. People like to shit on childfree people all the time without realizing that they come up short, too.", "Jealous, or they just don\u2019t get what it means to take care of another human. Pretty common in non-parents.", "I\u2019m the same, I can interact with kids just fine, I even volunteer to make balloon animals for a preschool occasionally but I under no circumstances want one of my own", "my youngest sibling is 18 yo, my mom still doesn't always pee alone.", "It's funny isn't it? The people who end up being there for you are often not the people you expected to be there for you.", "So don\u2019t go to someone\u2019s house and demand they put their kid away???", "Totally looking to get revenge. Look, lady, being in the same room as a human child and being slobbered on by your untrained dog are not the same thing. Dogs aren\u2019t the same as babies. AND, I wouldn\u2019t let my kid slobber on you. So stop playing dumb games.", "Wow jealousy is a bizarre choice of words. Kids are a nightmare", "Didn't I just say it was weird to make that demand? Wtf. Y'all get up in arms even when we agree with you. Damned if we do, damned if we don't.", "My bestie told me this too - that a lot of her friends ditched her when she had a kid (I met her when her kid was 3). I was baffled. Why would I not just want to chill out with her and the kid? Her kid's awesome, too.", "Exactly! What I'm getting from this entire post, in a nutshell, is that friends can become incompatible when their life paths diverge so markedly. No one is right or wrong, you just have different priorities, and not much in common any more. I am an introvert, and childfree by choice. I am very fond of my nieces and nephews, but can handle their company only in small doses. Even with adults I can get drained after some time. I too would have found it distracting to have a meeting with an agreed agenda (organising an event such as OP mentioned) with a baby, or even a television, distracting me. However I realise these are my issues, and I would have tried to be tactful, and tried not to shame the mother for her perceived \"baby brain\". I would have suggested meeting up later, when the baby was asleep, so we could both concentrate on the issue at hand. But I realise it is hard to maintain a friendship when you're not on the same page anymore. Sometimes it's easier to face the fact that you've simply grown apart, and let it go. Much like any relationship really.", "I\u2019m childfree and I do dislike kids. I also know it\u2019s better that I don\u2019t kids. I know, at a very deep level that I dont have the ability to be a good mother. That\u2019s not fair to a child. That said, kids don\u2019t deserve to have people be cruel to them. Kids should be wanted by their parents. \n\nI do try to avoid kids when I can. I\u2019m not good with kids, and I don\u2019t enjoy interacting with them. I\u2019m not going to try to be mean, in fact I\u2019m going to do my best not to do any harm when I do interact with them. I have a lot of friends with kids. While I do prefer to spend time with the, without their kids,  it doesn\u2019t always happen. That\u2019s life. Same with family. \n\nI do think my friends have a more relaxed time without their kids, but like so many things in life it\u2019s not worth getting upset about if sometimes plans change. Zones we do things with kids, sometimes without. That\u2019s friendship. My house is not child friendly and they respect that. Friends respect each other and their boundaries. I think it really can be that easy.", "I have a three year old and a lot of people probably think I'm a mombie. But in reality I have zero village and anyone I'm close to who could potentially babysit is the person I've been wanting to hangout with sans toddler. We are on a tight budget and cannot afford childcare (yet) so unfortunately a lot of adults only stuff just can't happen because I have no backup unless one of us doesn't go. The past few years have been extremely isolating. Thankfully I will be starting work again and our son will be old enough for preschool.", "No cocomelon? Ms Rachel? Lol\n\nI actually know those, and I\u2019m totally childfree (unless you count the collie fur babies) haha! I love kids, and I\u2019m totally down be friends with any moms, and dads at any time.
