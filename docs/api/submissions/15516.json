She mentions how last time I came to her place I asked her to put her dog in another room (nevermind it kept sniffing me and slobbering on my leg).  I told her that is very different, and i'll leave him in his playpen.  She starts arguing with me and I tell her she can leave, we can do this another time.

Under no circumstances can you just put a crawling baby in another room unsupervised! Your \u201cfriend\u201d is a nut job to think that is even in the realm of options. Your baby is nothing like her dog, your baby could actually die if left alone. \n\n\nAnd what the hell was he even doing that was so upsetting to her? Existing in her presence? She needs to get a grip.", "NTA. I'm also what one might call \"vocally childfree.\" That doesn't mean I hate children, and even if it did, that wouldn't be an excuse to be a dick to them. Just because your \"friend\" doesn't want to be a mother doesn't mean she gets to shame your choice or disrespect a fucking baby.", "NTA- being child free doesn\u2019t mean you get to demand that there be no children in your presence. She\u2019s just ridiculous.", "NTA.  Just because someone is child-free doesn't mean everyone else has to hide their children. And children aren't pets.  I mean, your baby isn't even old enough to inflict a serious bite.  (Give him another year and he'll be ready for the big time.)", "If someone told me to put my baby in another room I would ask them to put themselves outside my home. \n\nNTA and my advice is to dump that \"friend\"", "NTA a dog can be left unsupervised for a time. A puppy cannot. A young child can be left with distant supervision. A baby cannot. She should know this. I'm child-free. I don't ask my friends to put their babies up like toys they don't play with when I'm there. She could have simply asked that you make sure not to hand the baby off to her. If being that close was that bothersome to her, she should have politely expressed that you could do it another time preferably when your husband could be there to watch the baby.\n\nNo one puts baby in the corner.", "NTA your child is not a pet. Your friend is really strange to compare a baby to a dog.", "Nta.   She came to a house with a baby living there.  That's on her.", "NTA\n\nYour friend, on the other side... not for being childfree (that's her right), but because it's clear she doesn't respect you and your baby. I go so far as to say that she hates children.", "NTA.  You can't leave an awake baby unattended.  It's okay not to like kids, but your friend is ridiculous.  Kids have the right to exist, especially in their own homes.  Don't even get me started on trying to compare the child to a dog", "NTA. Infants and toddlers really shouldn't be left alone. And any experienced parent will tell you, a quiet child is one that should worry you (they're usually up to something!). If she wants to continue to be friends with you, she has to understand that your family will always come with that package.", "NTA. Was the baby sniffing her and drooling on her?  Were you bullying her into holding your baby? Demanding that she play and snuggle with the baby? Your baby sounds infinitely less intrusive than my friends chihuahua, who wouldn't stop sniffing my hair and trying to lick me. \n\n It's not just your home, its also the baby's home.\n\nBabies and children are members of society too. People who choose to be childless do not get to live in a child free world.\n\nI had this problem with my niece when I had a baby. I eventually just didn't invite her over anymore. We aren't close anymore because she treated my son very poorly due to the fact that she doesn't like small children, even though I never once asked her to hold him or feed him or play with him or interact with him at all.", "NO\n\nNTA\n\nDog verus kid, dog can be left alone for a few hours, 9 m. kid awake? Nope! You can leave him for a bathroom break, but that's it!", "Yikes. Your friend is being completely ridiculous. Your baby and the dog are two totally different situations.\n\nIf she wants to be child-free, great for her. You're not letting the baby crawl all over her or forcing her to hold your baby or anything. \n\nNTA", "Of course you were NTA. Perhaps your friendship has run its course.", "NTA. Friend definitely is. I understand pets are like family members to an extent. Difference being you can put a pet in another room unsupervised without worrying about its safety. Is this actually a friend? Or are you mutual friends of the person getting married? Because she is a huge AH & should not be considered your friend.", "NTA but I would heavily reconsider whether you want this person as your friend. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be child free (I certainly don't want a kid and have held fast to this desire my entire life) but that never gives someone the right to make demands of others who have kids just because they don't want to be around them.\n\nWhat happens when your child starts to walk around, require even more supervision from you so they don't end up getting hurt? This person can't expect you to just put your child in another room when they are around every single time or evenrually your kid is gonna realize that they have to be 'locked away' when this specific person comes over and resentment will start to build. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso a dog is very different from a child and is at a much less risk of severely harming themselves if left alone in another room for an hour compared to a HUMAN INFANT and the two situations cannot be compared to each other at all.", "Absolutely NTA. It\u2019s ridiculous of her to compare your child to her dog. Nine month old babies needs adult supervision when they are awake. Dogs don\u2019t.", "NTA what\u2019s wrong with her? A baby is not a dog.", "NTA. Your friend is, mainly for comparing your child to a dog.", "NTA\n\nWhat a terrible friend.  Your child is not a dog that you just put in the other room.", "NTA.\n\nI can't stand kids. But it's YOUR house and you absolutely have the right to have YOUR baby in the room with you.", "NTA. It's good she doesn't plan on having children because she behaved like an entitled idiot around yours. She obviously only wants childfree visits so unless you are inclined to accept that condition, don't make plans to meet up with her again. Make you plans virtually or one of you can bow out. Don't expose your child to such a cold creature in the future, he doesn't deserve the hatred.", "Oh. NTA all the way. \n\nYou can be child free and vocal about it, but you can't demand a mother leaving her 9mo baby awake, alone and unattended. \n\nDogs can be alone for hours and be fine if you take precautions like food, water, toxic stuff put away etc. Babies can harm themselves by rolling incorrectly especially at 9mo when they crawl, sit and almost stand up.", "Find a new friend", "NTA\n\nI can't stand being around babies (or dogs) but even I think your friend was out of line. If I *choose* to visit someone with a baby (or a dog) then I have to suck it up. Nobody forced them to visit you in your home. Caf\u00e9s are a thing.", "She should no longer be a friend.\n\nNTA", "Totally NTA.\nYour \u201cfriend\u201d totally the AH. Comparing the baby to her dog like it can be put away without supervision? She can\u2019t be that stupid to not know that is not OK. Childless or not.", "NTA. If she can't see how a dog and a child are different, that's her own issue.", "What the....\n\nYour kid lives there.  She doesn't.  I wouldn't let her set foot over the threshold again (though I also wouldn't have put my dog up for you,  but simply made him behave).\n\nNTA", "NTA. Not wanting kids is fine. Expecting them to evaporate is a bit unreasonable.", "NTA\n\nWas her dog a newborn puppy? That's the only way those two situations would be comparable lol. Babies will stick their fat little fingers into every death trap they can find, hell they'll figure out how to build their own if one is not provided at that age! They're lucky those fat little fingers are cute!", "NTA, put your \"friend\" on the other side of a baby gate. If she acts up, swat her nose with a rolled up newspaper and say \"bad girl\"", "NTA.\n\nI hate how some people are trying to make \"childfree\" mean \"absolutely no children around me at all times\". My wife and I are childfree - we love our nieces and nephews and play/babysit often, it's just not a good fit for us. Your friend can fuck right off.\n\nAlso, asking you to put a mobile, awake baby alone in another room?! Does she have any concept how dangerous that is, even if it a crib? Also a dog is not equal to a baby, speaking as a huge dog lover!!\n\nSounds like this friend needs to be low to no contact for a while until she gets her mindset reoriented.", "NTA. She knew, coming to your house, that there was also a baby there. Not a dog. \"Uncomfortable\"? snort. Nice when the trash takes itself out.", "NTA. You would be TA if you had put your awake nine month old in the other room. Your \"friend\" isn't childfree. She just hates children. And that's fine, but you can't go to someone's house where a baby lives and expect to have it removed from your presence. She's rude and stupid. Why are you friends with someone like this?", "Wow. I didn't know being childfree could also mean being afraid or disgusted by children in general. That's really weird. \n\nYour are NTA.", "Whaaat asking to out a baby in another room? It\u2019s not a dog. I would instantly quit the friendship. She is selfish, immature and just insane", "NTA\n\nI'm baffled by the amount of people who seem to think that 'childfree' means 'no children in my presence, ever, under any circumstances'\n\nDoes she demand that mothers with strollers get off the bus because she's 'childfree'? Or that a store kicks out any families because she shouldn't have to be subjected to the them?\n\nFFS, just because she doesn't like children doesn't give her the right to tell you what to do with yours, in your own home no less.\n\nI hate to say it, but I think this friendship is over, and honestly it's probably for the best", "NTA. I don't like kids but even I know better.", "You can't put a baby in a other room where you don't have eyes on them for any length of time. It's not safe, and it wouldn't work - the baby will start crying if it's left alone. This is a child, not a pet.", "NTA.  I'm childfree and prefer not being around kids but I wouldn't be this much of a dick about it.  The kid is nine months old and yeah, you need to be watching him, and it's probably good for his development that you not put him into a separate room like that.", "Babies are people, people. Theyre just very new very small people. You can choose not to procreate but you cannot remove all babies and children from your life. This idiot is an idiot.", "I\u2019m a dog mom, my dog is my everything. But even I know you never leave a baby unsupervised. Especially if they\u2019re crawling. Putting a dog away is nowhere near the same thing. \n\nI don\u2019t understand the weird animosity towards children, even if you\u2019re a child free person. NTA", "NTA. your child is another human being who is really vulnerable at that age its not a dog you can just take out for a while omg. she came to your house, she should\u2019ve accepted your child being there, just because she doesnt want one its so shitty to act like this..", "NTA. Anyone who can't tell a dog from a baby probably shouldn't have either - particularly if they use either to control a homeowner in their OWN HOME. Are you sure this person is \\*actually\\* your friend?", "Dog owner was lying in wait to turn the tables on you and ask you to put the baby in another room. She\u2019s a jerk. You, OP, are NTA.", "Hell no not the Ahole!!! Who compares a dog with a baby?!?!? Clearly your so called friend is the Ahole!!! Can you put the baby in the other room? Get the fuck out of here!!!!", "NTA. Your \"friend\" set this situation up as some kind of weird \"gotcha\" because she literally believes dogs are equivalent to human children. \n\nThere's happily childfree, and then there's whatever the fuck that is.", "NTA. She was being a passive-aggressive ass, still pissed that you asked her to move her dog to another room. She doesn\u2019t sound like much of a friend atm.", "NTA. What is wrong with that person?", "Literally everything changes when you have a kid, if friends aren\u2019t cool with that then they\u2019re not friends. NTA\nEdit spelling", "NTA. It sounds like your friend is jealous. Is your friend incapable of having a child, or dislikes them?", "Can't wait to see OP's friend post about how her parent friend dropped her and the comments about how all parents are selfish people who put their kids above friends. Lol", "Gross. Child free is fine, a legitimate choice for any of the reasons. \n\nAnti-child is antisocial.\n\nYou are NTA", "Your friend sounds horrid. Not everyone has to love kids or want them, but comparing them to a dog? Uh, not the same thing. \n\nNTA, time to find some new friends.", "Nta, i am childfree and definitely not a child person but I am actually a decent human being and know how to interact with babies.

I\u2019m childfree as well, however I wouldn\u2019t not be uncomfortable with a mother holding her child. Your child is a baby human, not an animal you can just shut in another room. That\u2019s incredibly weird your \u201cfriend\u201d expects you to do so.", "So completely NTA. Your \"friend\" sounds selfish and awful. You are in your own house, and your child is a human being. She thinks your human child has less value than a dog. Yikes. I wouldn't spend time with that one anymore.", "NTA. You need a better friend.", "NTA for sure. I am child free and dislike children but never ever would I ask someone to put their baby into a different room unsupervised. I don't know much about baby's but that would go against all common sense and logic. Esp the comparison to her dog is weird.\nSeems like she is mad at you for having a kid.

Her behavior is so unbelievably wrong.", "NTA but your friend should be an ex friend", "NTA\n\nYour \"friend\" has been mad since you asked for her doggie-child to be put in a different room. \n\nShe was begging for a conflict, and created one in order to have her moment.

I am childfree, but he is a 9 month old baby. And you can\u2019t compare baby with a dog! What the fuck?", "There is something wrong with your friend if she is uncomfortable simply being around someone with a baby.

Let's just say you have a dog instead of a baby.\n\nHere is why your request was reasonable, and hers wasn't:\n\nHer dog was touching you and getting their spit all over you. This dog was not contained, and you asked for this dog to be contained so it couldn't get their spit all over you. Your \"dog\" was contained in a pen and incapable of slobbering all over your friend's legs, even if they were in the same room.\n\nNow let's remember that as much as dogs are humankind's best friend, they are not, in fact, human, and remember that your friend is an asshole.", "NTA. Holy crap. I'm \"vocally childfree\" too, but this is a whole different thing. This is bonkers behavior. If you are holding your son or he is in the playpen, what could her objection possibly be? She needs some therapy to work on her phobia of tiny humans!", "I'm  childfree and wouldn't wanna someone to hand me a baby , so I'm not a huge fan of interacting with kids .

You could handle some party planning in a room where there's a baby in a playpen?", "As a dog owner, if *my* dog were licking you and slobbering all over you then I would be mortified. OP shouldn't have even had to ask.", "Lmao I struggled to type out the word \u201cpawrent\u201d cause it\u2019s not a thing where I am, we commonly use the word owner. But my dogs *do* know the family titles \u201cmom\u201d \u201cuncle\u201d \u201cgranddad,\u201d but I think they picked it up from us using it on the actual kiddos. \n\nCrawling 9 month olds can definitely get into more trouble without supervision. Heck even four year olds are a hassle\u2026 I remember one time one of my cousins kids visited and he managed to pull the pin and set off our fire extinguisher in under a minute while my father and I weren\u2019t looking and he was so proud of himself for \u201cmaking it snow.\u201d \n\nMy dogs cannot make it snow and I\u2019m so thankful for it!", "First?\n\nLast day I had to tell my kids that I kinda like being alone in there alone... har 2 kids in there 4 and 9, 12 was calling from the kitchen \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nBut on the bright side, the girls has known about the time a month since very young \ud83e\udd23", "Me too, but in a little different way now. At first, I understand that they have baby duties and we will hang out at some point in the future. It\u2019s been dubbed \u201cbaby jail\u201d. I\u2019ve been bumped down the list of importance. I get it. What I have to check the jealousy on is that the ones with kids get together for play dates and birthdays and I\u2019m not invited. Of course I\u2019m not. But I also don\u2019t get to hang out and catch up like they do. Now that the kids are a little older we make it a point to see each other, just the adults and honestly, it\u2019s totally worth waiting for. I\u2019m so glad our friendships made it. Also\u2026 kids are funny. lol \u2026 and it helps that we got a cute dog in a circle of friends that don\u2019t have pets. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019m 90% sure I\u2019m being included in a kid rich event to bring the dog, and I\u2019m perfectly fine with that.", "It also needs a health balance in priorities. Children come first, but forgetting about your friends also makes you an AH.", "Then don't go into their home. Do you apply that logic to literally any other demographic of human?", "Then the friend could have asked to get together without the baby. They met at OP\u2019s home while her husband was golfing\u2026 \n\nShe could have requested to meet up at a coffee shop at a time when OP\u2019s husband was free to look after the baby if she really can\u2019t stand to be around an infant.", "i dont care either way with this story just playing devils advocate, why would op go to her friends house knowing she has a dog and ask it to be put in the other room even though its the dogs home? theyre both as bad as eachother in that respect", "Right. I\u2019ve definitely put my dogs elsewhere when people came over and they weren\u2019t behaving.", "Yeah, I dunno. Like Ive thought of all my cats over the years as my babies. My boys, my girls. But I definitely dont think of myself as a parent or \"dad\".\n\nOne of the grossest things is my mom coming over and baby talking to them and calling herself grandma. Ugh.\n\nIve straight up told her I hate it. And it's this exact act and attitude that played a large part in never giving her any human grandchildren.\n\nMy favorite is still my niece. 3yo at the time. I was watching her for the day. Put her down for her nap and decided I might as well take one too.\n\nNow my cousin had been giving my niece little gerkin pickles around that time. She just loved those things. Accept it was pretty common to find she didnt finish the last bite. And every once in a while my cousin would find a little dried up desicated bit of pickle under the couch or something while cleaning.\n\nSo back to this nap and she comes running to wake me up. And she's all happy and super proud of herself. And I dont know what is going on, half asleep. And she hands me something while just babbling away about something. \n\nSo I put out my hand, and it sure looks a lot like a little bit of dried up pickle lands in my hand. And I close my fist over it, just to keep it somewhere until I shake out these cobwebs, finally get whatever story this little girl is trying to ell me understood, and then find a garbage.\n\nHer story? She just used the potty by herself for the first time. And look in your hand at the poop I brought to show you.", "Yeah, this is my first. He doesn't understand that sometimes adults need privacy.", "That\u2019s not germane to the topic at hand though.", "She wasn't abandoning her friends.  She invited her into her new life, but the friend was not willing to adapt to her new life.", "OP is planning a bachelorette. Sounds like she remembers her friends. You\u2019re majorly projecting.", "If they are decent friends they will reach out to you, because they understand that you've recently had a child and may not have the time, energy or memory to reach out..", "What logic? That just because this woman didn\u2019t want to be around the kid doesn\u2019t make her jealous? Yeah I do thanks.", "I agree, she should have been upfront with the mother before the meeting. My only point in commenting was to agree that there are many reasons other than jealousy that someone would not want to be around someone else\u2019s baby. I wasn\u2019t agreeing with what happened in this situation.", "No they aren't.\n\n1. Baby was in the same room ...in a pen. Not only the friends actual lap spitting up on her face. Perhaps if her friend had a dog pen in the room or a dog that is trained enough to not jump up and slobber on people, she wouldn't have asked her friend to put the dog in another area.\n\n2. Dogs are actually animals of a different species, not infants. So a dog can be alive in a backyard or bedroom while still being alive. 9 month babies tend to die if they're not watched \n\nI have a cat. She's alive in an alive way. Even though she's not in the room with me. When I go to work, she is alone for the whole 9 hours. And hasn't died yet.\n\nWhat do you think happens when you leave a 9 month old alone on the floor for 9 hours?", "A dog that lives inside a home can and should be trained and the owner should be able to tell them to stop licking and drooling all over somebody. You cannot train a 9 month old, expect them to sit silently in a play pen, or lock them away . The only solution is to chill the fuck out or only meet elsewhere/when the baby is with somebody else", "Dogs are completely safe in another room.  Children are not.", "Mine have been known to slide things into bathroom under the door (drawings, notes saying Hi mom are you there) while I'm sitting on the toilet", "The logic that if you \"just don't like\" any other demographic of person then you should go into their house and demand they go away. Neither you or I said anything at all about jealousy so that's obviously not what I was talking about... obviously...", "Oh, gotcha. Sorry for the misunderstanding there.", "That's so cute \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\udc96", "Obviously the original comment I replied to was about jealousy. I was agreeing that there were reasons other than jealousy someone wouldn\u2019t want to be around someone else\u2019s baby. You obviously lack reading comprehension skills and want to bait me into an argument so my replies to you will stop here.", ">Obviously the original comment I replied to was about jealousy\n\nAnd if I were commenting on what *they* said then I'd have replied to *them*."]}
