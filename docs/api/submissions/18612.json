Even then, there was another teacher from the same subject willing to help me. Trust me, you're NTA, i was exactly like your \"friend,\" and even then I could realize that the problem was me.", "NTA. You told her the truth that learning also requires the student to put in the effort. Your friend is delusional that she can get good grades by not even showing up in exams and you're a good friend for not feeding into that delusion.\n\nSenioritis is a thing, but she let it take over for far too long and she has only herself to blame for that.", "NTA. She\u2019s a silly Sally blaming everyone but herself. It was never your responsibility to push her into studying or doing her work so don\u2019t think there is anything more that you could\u2019ve done. You snapping at her is justified. Let her deal with the consequences.", "NTA  \nI had students do this every year. I would always make time for them to make up any work they wanted. I once had a coach walk in with a top player and had him explain how the student needed a higher grade to get into a top school. He didn't ask me to just change his grade, he asked me what he would have to do to pull his grade up. I told him all the projects he had half-assed, and that if he did them all again and got them up to a B for each one, he'd get his grade up to an acceptable level. He spent three solid weeks doing it and pulled it off. I know tons of teachers that would do the same thing for any student. You gave your friend the best advice, but she is choosing to wallow in misery rather than try.", "NTA. and make a note of this behavior as you will see it repeatedly in adulthood in a variety of situations. some people can't handle the truth. i learned that from a movie i saw awhile back.", "NTA. there\u2019s only so many times you can listen to someone complain about the same thing. especially cause she\u2019s had every chance to fix the problem but hasn\u2019t. you got frustrated and snapped. a totally normal reaction IMO\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA don't worry hun.

Sally has a harsh lesson to learn, and one that won\u2019t go away as she enters adulthood outside of high school: there comes a point where you have to actually *do* something instead of waiting for others to magically solve your problems for you. Also, she literally came to your house and pestered you with her complaints while you were trying to work - it\u2019s not like you went looking for her to have this conversation.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. The truth hurts.\n\nTell me, is Sally intending to go on to further education? College, university, whatever it's called where you live?\n\nIn the country I live in, high schools tend to do a fair amount of hand-holding. They'll mark attendance, chase you up if you're absent, remind you of tests, nag you to hand in your essay, and so on.\n\nBut once you're at university, you're expected to be self-reliant. No one will remind you that the essay is due in on Monday or the final exam is Wednesday. You're expected to keep track of deadlines yourself, and schedule your days so you get the work completed in time. No one will check to make sure you've understood everything you've been taught. If you're struggling and need help, you're expected to ask for it. And in many courses, there's no mandatory minimum attendance. Some courses do (especially ones that involve lab work), but otherwise, if you make a habit of skipping class, that's your problem. Basically, you're treated as an adult, not the child you were in high school.\n\nWhat tends to happen is that the students who had their hands held all the way through the senior years of high school fall down in a heap when they get to university. They're expected to be self-reliant, and they don't know how.\n\nIt sounds like Sally is getting plenty of hand-holding already, and despite all the reminders, she's *still* failing. She doesn't have a hope in hell of surviving university, so I hope that higher education isn't part of her plans for the future.", "She's literally complaining to you while you're doing your homework? Of course you're gonna snap at her. NTA", "NTA and my blood is boiling.\n\nLook, I know how easy it is to let things fall through the cracks your senior year. I don't know if the term \"senioritis\" is still used, but that's what we called it a decade ago. I was your friend, though not nearly as bad. I'd skip English every day because it was the one right after my lunch period and I would hang out and eat lunch with a friend who graduated early. Eventually the teacher from the class pulled me aside and gave it to me straight: I was doing A and B quality work on the assignments I was there for but all the missed assignments and tests brought me straight down to an F. A low F. He gave me a chance to make up the work during my free period at the start of the day and I brought my grade up to a C by the end of the year.\n\nTo make it totally clear: this absolute gem of a man went above and beyond his job description to reach out to a student who quite frankly, didn't deserve a second chance. I am eternally grateful to him. I wrote him a letter I gave to him at the end of the year because I knew thanking him in person would make me incredibly emotional. I would not have graduated on time without that English credit.\n\nThe fact that your friend EXPECTS the teachers to bend over backwards (more than they already have!!!) to make sure her ungrateful ass graduates is doing my head in. I get that she doesn't want to accept it's her own damn fault, but it is.\n\nEdited for typos", "NTA. I have a friend who did similar things (not skipping but constantly slacking), he\u2019s on Ds rn but he\u2019s realized the issue is him and is working his ass off to get to maybe Bs. Sally sounds like she has the IQ and work ethic of a damp pile of old socks.", "There wasn't anything you could do better. It's okay.", "Absolutely. And you can tell your friend that teachers often have to spend 3x longer and put in 3x more effort for students like her than they do for other students who put in effort. It\u2019s unfair and frustrating.\n\nTeachers want students like your friend to succeed. Teachers will get reamed and blamed by parents, students, and administrators if they don\u2019t go above and beyond to provide evidence that they\u2019ve helped a student who ultimately failed. Even if that student consistently does absolutely nothing to help themselves, or to ask for help. They have to take the time to send reminder emails to her and probably her parents, during their prep period when they\u2019re meant to be marking the work of students who actually did bother to come to class and submit the assignments. \n\nIn life, you don\u2019t get to blame your boss for not calling you every day to remind you to come into work for your shift, or fulfil your basic duties. You\u2019ll just be fired for your complete lack of effort.\n\nShe needed to hear you say that. Deep down she knows you\u2019re right, but she won\u2019t thank you for it. For her to complain about this to you *while you are studying* is beyond frustrating.", "I heard that line! X) Nice reference!", "NTA. Your friend has major senioritis and it is 100% on her. You said what needed to be said and that is the truth.", "The entire r/teachers sub is here to tell you you're NTA.", "Awww. Tysm.", "I would say definitely don't live with this person in college... But something tells me she's not too concerned with next steps.\n\nShe's gonna get evicted one day because of her logic \"well the landlord didn't call me to tell me rent was due by the 3rd.\"", "NTA\n\n>she didn\u2019t have time to get her grades up\n\nNot with that kind of attitude!\n\n>none of the teachers would have time for her since were so close to the end of the year\n\nTeachers (well, most of them anyways - there are some who suck) do care, and they want their students to succeed. But it also requires effort on the student's part! Sally is TA for blaming her teachers for her lack of effort, and you aren't TA for being honest with her.\n\nEven at this late stage of the year, I bet if Sally goes in, talks to them, *takes responsibility* for her lack of effort instead of blaming them, and does well on her finals, her teachers would be willing to work with her. Probably not the grades she would have wanted, but at least good enough to pass. And once she goes through college or gets some job experience, no one will care about her high school GPA.", "Yeah\u2026 NTA. Unfortunately people who do not wanna take accountability for their actions will always find someone to blame and they do not like being called out on the consequences of their choices. Going forward, it might be a good thing to allow a little distance between you and this friend, unless you\u2019re up for the time suck. Congrats on your graduation, and I wish you all the success in the world."]}
