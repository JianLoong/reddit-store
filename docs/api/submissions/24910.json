I was one of 4 bridesmaids. Alexa's new sister inlawJessie (30) and I never got along. I introduced my cousin to her now husband. Jessie always seemed to me like the pick me girl whenever I'd hang out with her brother and our friends she would tag along, and she was always fishing for compliments. Always wanted to be the center of attention. She became upset when she wasn't asked to be a bridesmaid. Alexa didn't like her behavior either. \n\nWell, during the whole wedding planning, my cousin Alexa made it clear she was wearing a white and black dress. White with black lacking on top. She sent out invitations with the dress code and said, \"Please don't wear white.\" Last weekend as the ceremony was about to start and we where about to start walking down the isle, we saw her in a Long satin white dress.The bridesmaids and  got mad but decided not to say a word as to not upset the bride during her big moment. At the reception, my cousin became aware of it since people were saying they thought Jessie was the bride for a second and thought she changed into a cocktail dress. I clearly saw the hurt in my cousin's eyes. I had made up my mind. The wedding was buffet style. I went up and got a plate of food, and I stopped  by Jessie's table she was with some friends. I held  my plate in one hand, and I was casually talking to the friends when I \"accidentally\" let my food slip. I had some green chicken curry on it, and it fell on her dress. She let out a loud gasp and immediately got up and  started loading, saying I ruined her designer dress. I said it was an accident and she left. She didn't come back. Some people were glad I did it, but some people are saying I'm the AH. Bc she took the dress to get cleaned and it won't come off.shes demanding I pay for a new dress. I'm starting to think I am the AH bc I completely  ruined it.  \n**** edit**** Alexa is my cousin and Jessie is the SIL.  The title is wrong I'm on the road traveling so I typed and published b4 seeing the mistake it should say cousin's  SIL dress*****", "created_utc": 1692334308, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15uam1p/aita_for_spilling_food_on_my_cousins_2000_dress/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She f\u2019ed around and found out. It was deliberately attention seeking on her part and your duty as a bridesmaid on yours.", "I\u2019m inclined to say NTA I mean it is a shitty thing to do but you were just matching her shitty attitude and tryin to help the bride feel better. Idk why people try to go out of their way to be dicks to the couple getting married by doing shit like this. I personally don\u2019t care that much about that kind of thing but if I did I would love that my bridesmaid took care of it like this -I mean petty is as petty does what did she expect???", "Use parargpaHs", "NTA. She was wearing white and everyone knows not to wear white around drunk people. You had an accident and didn\u2019t know better. And how were you supposed to know curry stained permanently?", "Mmm I'd say NTA but also you are a little. I wouldn't pay for it, it will blow over at some point. \n\nKeep saying it was an accident.", "NTA. Was requested that no one wear white...never mentioned what the consequences would be. And don't shell any money out until she can provide a receipt.", "Laughingly, YTA. Technically, you should pay for the dress, but it\u2019s up to you if you decide to. If she insists on payment & you decide to pay, ask for proof that is was a $2,000 dress. But I am vindictive enough, I\u2019d continue to claim it was an accident.", "ESH. You didn't need to punish her. Her life is sad enough already and everyone at the wedding knew it", "YTA  Jesse was rude for wearing white to a wedding, but you took it next level by intentionally spilling food on her dress.  Two wrongs don't make a right.", "ESH, but you are the bigger AH.\n\n\"I responded to poor social etiquette by purposely damaging something worth thousands of dollars. Am I an asshole?\"\n\nNot very hard to figure that one out. She should have been asked to leave. What you did was over the top and you should post to have the dress cleaned or replaced.", "NTA", "YTA you should have had a conversation with her like an adult & explained to her that the rules are you can\u2019t wear white. Security could have escorted her out & that would be a better consequence than ruining the dress.", "YTA. Sure, she was very inconsiderate to wear white but you\u2019re not the bride. Should\u2019ve let Alexa handle it herself. You did this more or less because you never liked Jessie.", "YTA - you ruined it on purpose out of pure immaturity instead of being above it all and ignoring it like your cousin, the bride, was.", "She's definitely an AH - and everyone knew that, because you *don't* wear a white satin dress to a wedding.\n\nBut you were absolutely an AH as well.\n\nYour job as bridesmaid was to support the bride, not punish guests who contravened the dress code (and cause a scene into the bargain).\n\n>she took the dress to get cleaned and it won't come off\n\nOf course it won't come off.

This is so hard to read and it\u2019s hard to keep up", "YTA - You shouldn't have stooped down to her level and just ignored her if you knew she had that kind of pick-me attitude.

You didn't want to ruin the atmosphere for the Bride yet you did exactly that with a worse thing.\n\nYou are both TAs but because of your action, you became the bigger A.", "YTA; the other girl was in the wrong too, but you made it worse with an immature response.

Good for you.", "I will say her other 3 bridesmaids were her two sisters and her best friend, who all told me. I got to her before any of them could. She was the last of the guests to make her arrival and she arrived \"late\" even tho she rode in with her parents She walked down the aisle quite literally after her brother was at the alter and the bridesmaids and groomsmen where lining up to make our entrance entrance.", "Came here to say the same thing: I'd want proof the dress was actually designer and she had paid $2000 for it. Otherwise the cousin-SIL is just trying for even more attention. I'd also want proof that the stain couldn't be removed. I've got worse out of more delicate fabrics.\n\nESH - OP for spilling food on and potentially ruining a dress. The cousin-SIL for clearly attention seeking and breaking the rules everyone attending a wedding knows:\n\nDont wear white\n\nDont wear black\n\nDont wear the same color as the bridesmaids\n\nDont dress like a ho\n\nAnd also (although open to correction on this because I only just recently heard it) dont wear red unless you're a bridesmaid and that's the color they're wearing. Apparently it means you've 'had relations' with the groom.\n\n\\*All these rules do not apply if specifically asked to wear any of the above by the bride and groom, but by them only.", "Unfortunately there was no security  as this wedding was at our families farm. And they rented out tents to do the wedding.  I do want to say she was told multiple times that invitations aside not to wear white. Her brother even said it in a joking manner at a BBQ  3 weeks before the wedding. \"None of yall try and upstage my wife, and I we paid a whole lot of money to be upstaged, and if we get upstaged, I'm going to send yall the bill for the wedding\" and my cousin had told her husband to be she was worried his sister was going to make an all about me speech. Since she asked her brother if she could make a speech after the best man and maid of honor speeches and he said no bc the only other ppl making a speech  are the parents if they want too.", "  I will say this to my defense, I offered to pay, and I even offered to pay the cleaning fee too if she  showed me where she got it and how much I'd pay her. But she doesn't want that she wants me to pay double, and she isn't even  going to buy herself a new one bc ppl already saw her in it. Her brother talked to her after the wedding and he said she was wearing a very inappropriate  dress and it wasn't even the dress she had first shown him.", "To be fair, there are people that can be hired to spill on wedding guests that do pull this. NTA.", "If this was a controlling MIL who wants her baby boy to herself wearing white to her DIL's wedding, everyone would be saying NTA. Just last week I read a story (granted, it was posted a while ago) about a bridesmaid \"accidentally\" spilling wine on the MIL's white dress and everyone rooted for it. Months ago I read another one about a friend of the soon to be husband who wanted to wear white at the wedding and everyone condemned her, too. NTA. The invitations explicitly stated \"don't wear white\". OP saw how hurt the bride was, knew that people assumed this narcissistic woman was the bride, and acted accordingly. \n\nAlso, if this woman spent 2k on that dress, chances are she will be able to get another one. Good whatever you believe in, people but clearly OP was the only one to stand up for her cousin.", "Alexa is your cousin, yes? And she was the bride.  Jessie is Alexa's new sister in law, correct?  Jessie wore white to Alexa's wedding.  MAJOR MISTAKE. Who the h*!! (besides the bride) wears white to a wedding? Definitely NTA, and don't even consider paying for the dress. And you didn't spill on your cousin's dress, you spilled on her new SIL's dress.  No relation to you.", "NTA. That's part of your job as bridesmaid- wreck everyy white dress that isnt the bride's.", "NTA - attention seeker? Guess she got the attention she deserved", "NTA\n\nAnyone who wears white to a wedding (especially when the bride has asked them not to) is suffering  from a severe case of \u201cMain Character Syndrome\u201d. Im afraid the only cure is a solid dose of reality.\n\nYou should suggest that maybe she dyes the dress \u201cjealousy green\u201d to cover the stain\ud83d\ude01\n\nDon\u2019t pay for it. The only person who has any right to  be wearing a dress costing in the thousands is the bride.", "ESH. The other girl for wearing the white dress. You for technically committing battery and processing your emotions as a child would.", "YTA for one reason, the act wasn\u2019t done for a noble reason but vindictiveness. You set out to humiliate her because you don\u2019t like her and you used the reason that she was \u201churting your friend\u201d by wearing a white dress to justify it. I could also say that YOUR behavior is pretty similar to Jessie\u2019s, you wanted the attention being the \u201chero that saved your friend\u2019s honor\u201d brought. You both wanted attention, you just used different methods.", "YTA Everyone knew your cousin was being tacky and will think less of her for wearing white. You didn't have to do anything and spilling food on her is really childish. It's a fun idea but not one you actually follow through on. All you did was call more attention to it and create unnecessary drama. What she did was tacky but not illegal and you're not the wedding police. If I were the bride I'd be annoyed with both of you.", "YTA but who cares?? You don\u2019t like her and she was a jerk too\u2026sometimes it\u2019s worth it to be TA!", "That's an Asshole move so yeah you're an asshole for purposely spilling food on someone.", "NTA \nThat\u2019s what happens when you show up wearing white! When it\u2019s not your wedding!", "NTA... You don't wear white to someone else's wedding. She deserved it.", "NTA. Or justified at the very least. Good on you.", "NTA sounds awesome dude but you do need to pay for the dress, but totally worth hehehehe", "nta, she had it coming", "NTA \n\nIn my opinion, that's part of the roles of Bridesmaid/best man to sabotage the clothing of  the invitees in white. 100% on Jessie", "Good for you, NTA....What a jerk Alexa was. Well whoops you dropped your food, well accidents happen.", "NTA\n\nYou are great.", "NTA - and no, you shouldn't have to pay for a new dress.", "pay the dry cleaning bills.  that is your obligations.  your justification or motive does not matter in this kind of things.

So a full on wedding dress? At someone else\u2019s (her brother\u2019s??) wedding? NTA, the curry was a nice touch.\n\nSome people only learn the hard way.", "ESH -- I mean wow, damn, all of this is just AH behavior. Poor bride, it's her day and it's been made all about someone else.", "100% NTA!!!! Jessie was asking for it. Laugh in her face if she asks you for money.", "Sounds like a waste of a good curry, should have used the cheapest red win they had.", "NTA, but it might costs you 2000 dollar :)", "She got the attention she so desperately wanted. NTA", "NTA. I will never feel bad for someone who purposely wears white to a wedding( unless the bride and groom are both okay with it).", "Youll be the AH if you buy a new dress. Good job!", "I mean she should have been told to leave when she arrived like that, and removed from the event. You\u2019re kinda AH, but like in a brilliant way where I\u2019m like girl I\u2019d be friends with you - you have some solid loyalty and you protect your friends. Love that for your cousin. \n\nSo NTA really", "Nta, wearing white so someone else\u2019s wedding is pretty rude. There\u2019s plenty of good stain removers for whites though, she just needs to try harder.", "Exactly! Everyone knows not to wear white to a wedding or you run the risk of having something accidentally spilled on you.\nAlso like who would want to be the one everyone laughs and comments about at a wedding because you know everyone there was chatting and saying what poor form it is to wear white NTA", "It's a curious thing I've observed on this subreddit: people will suggest petty or justified AH acts like this, but the moment they read it's actually been done, they're quick to condemn the act. I do salute the sacrificed curry though, took one for the team.", "Love your attitude! \ud83e\udd23", "I\u2019d pay money to see the face. Bonus points if there were tear stained makeup cuz I\u2019m just mean like that.", "Sorry yes I'm traveling and on the road so my  title was wrong and should have said my cousin's sister in law.

I introduced them.", "A what\u2026 Lol jk jk", "Try as I might, I cannot pronounce this word!", "Also, potentially, YTA to the venue, for having to clean up food stains.", "if someones gonna fuck up the day get them tf out of there it's not about punishment NTA", "Sometimes, it makes you feel right", "Very surprised to see so many just thinking it was ok. Apparantly, everyone loves a vigilante. But there were other ways of handling this without the descruction of property. She should have just been thrown out for failing to meet the dresscode. And OP states in comments, that Jessie rode there with her parents. Talk about enabling your childs crappy behavior. Tons of assholes in this scenario - OP at least has some justification but all around ESH.", "Oh hell no she was asking for it, you literally served it up on a platter. What kind of sister does this to her own brother anyway, I feel sorry for the whole fam.", ">She was the last of the guests to make her arrival and she arrived \"late\" even tho she rode in with her parents\n\nSo her parents knew what she was wearing and didn't stop her/refuse to bring her? They're AHs too, then.", "Aw helllllll no! Walking down the aisle in the white dress? Just reinforces my NTA verdict.", "Sameeeee !!! and if other people were laughing too and she made a dramatic exit, i love these thing", "I don't think the black thing is universal. I've been to plenty of weddings where people wore black and it was never an issue.", "Don't pay her anything. She refuses to provide receipts and refuses to show the cleaning bill. If she wants money then she needs to provide those and the dress to you since you are essentially paying for it. You could always purposely stain it more and sell it as \"designer\"", "They don't have the greatest relationship. In the 8 yrs I've known him, he has said many times she tries to make everything about her.. When he got into a motorcycle accident  the family canceled  their vacation and his sister said they should all go bc all he did was break a couple of bones and her outfits where going to be out of season if they went the next  yr instead.", "Yaaaaasss!!", "The key thing is that it shouldn't be a funeral outfit or a bridal outfit. Both of those are clear FU outfits.\n\nSmart monochrome patterns with a pop of colour, or black/white background to a floral print are not usually inappropriate, though for this particular wedding they would have been best avoided.", "I don't think black is an issue either. Loads of people wear black to weddings a lot of men tend to wear black suits too.", "She deserved some curry on her clothes then too"]}
