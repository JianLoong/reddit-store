I was one of 4 bridesmaids. Alexa's new sister inlawJessie (30) and I never got along. I introduced my cousin to her now husband. Jessie always seemed like to me like the pick me girl whenever I'd hang out with her brother and our friends she would tag along, and she was always fishing for compliments. Always wanted to be the center of attention. She became upset when she wasn't asked to be a bridesmaid. Alexa didn't like her behavior either. \nWell, during the whole wedding planning, my cousin Alexa made it clear she was wearing a white and black dress. White with black lacking on top. She sent out invitations with the dress code and said, \"Please don't wear white.\" Last weekend as the ceremony was about to start and we where about to start walking down the isle, we saw her in a Long satin white dress.The bridesmaids and  got mad but decided not to say a word as to not upset the bride during her big moment. At the reception, my cousin became aware of it since people were saying they thought Jessie was the bride for a second and thought she changed into a cocktail dress. I clearly saw the hurt in my cousin's eyes. I had made up my mind. The wedding was buffet style. I went up and got a plate of food, and I stopped  by Jessie's table she was with some friends. I held  my plate in one hand, and I was casually talking to the friends when I \"accidentally\" let my food slip. I had some green chicken curry on it, and it fell on her dress. She let out a loud gasp and immediately got up and  started loading, saying I ruined her designer dress. I said it was an accident and she left. She didn't come back. Some people were glad I did it, but some people are saying I'm the AH. Bc she took the dress to get cleaned and it won't come off.shes demanding I pay for a new dress.

To spill a drink or food on the person! Every. Single. Time. (But you are a teensy bit of an ah - for wasting perfectly good curry like that.)", "NTA - This girl is an attention seeker, and what you did is so funny !\ud83e\udd72 i would have love to see her face \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA. She f\u2019ed around and found out. It was deliberately attention seeking on her part and your duty as a bridesmaid on yours.", "I\u2019m inclined to say NTA I mean it is a shitty thing to do but you were just matching her shitty attitude and tryin to help the bride feel better. Idk why people try to go out of their way to be dicks to the couple getting married by doing shit like this. I personally don\u2019t care that much about that kind of thing but if I did I would love that my bridesmaid took care of it like this -I mean petty is as petty does what did she expect???", "Use parargpaHs", "NTA. She was wearing white and everyone knows not to wear white around drunk people. You had an accident and didn\u2019t know better. And how were you supposed to know curry stained permanently?", "Mmm I'd say NTA but also you are a little. I wouldn't pay for it, it will blow over at some point. \n\nKeep saying it was an accident.", "NTA. Was requested that no one wear white...never mentioned what the consequences would be. And don't shell any money out until she can provide a receipt.", "Laughingly, YTA. Technically, you should pay for the dress, but it\u2019s up to you if you decide to. If she insists on payment & you decide to pay, ask for proof that is was a $2,000 dress. But I am vindictive enough, I\u2019d continue to claim it was an accident.", "ESH. You didn't need to punish her. Her life is sad enough already and everyone at the wedding knew it", "YTA  Jesse was rude for wearing white to a wedding, but you took it next level by intentionally spilling food on her dress.  Two wrongs don't make a right.", "ESH, but you are the bigger AH.\n\n\"I responded to poor social etiquette by purposely damaging something worth thousands of dollars. Am I an asshole?\"\n\nNot very hard to figure that one out. She should have been asked to leave. What you did was over the top and you should post to have the dress cleaned or replaced.", "NTA", "YTA you should have had a conversation with her like an adult & explained to her that the rules are you can\u2019t wear white. Security could have escorted her out & that would be a better consequence than ruining the dress.", "YTA. Sure, she was very inconsiderate to wear white but you\u2019re not the bride. Should\u2019ve let Alexa handle it herself. You did this more or less because you never liked Jessie.", "YTA - you ruined it on purpose out of pure immaturity instead of being above it all and ignoring it like your cousin, the bride, was.", "She's definitely an AH - and everyone knew that, because you *don't* wear a white satin dress to a wedding.\n\nBut you were absolutely an AH as well.\n\nYour job as bridesmaid was to support the bride, not punish guests who contravened the dress code (and cause a scene into the bargain).\n\n>she took the dress to get cleaned and it won't come off\n\nOf course it won't come off. If you'd spilt cola on her, I might have a different view, but **green curry**? Did you think it would just rinse out?\n\nYou and Jessie both suck, ESH.", "INFO. This is so hard to read and it\u2019s hard to keep up", "YTA - You shouldn't have stooped down to her level and just ignored her if you knew she had that kind of pick-me attitude. There was absolutely no reason for you to escalate the situation into \"accidentally\" spilling food on her dress just to embarrass or get her out of there. You didn't want to ruin the atmosphere for the Bride yet you did exactly that with a worse thing.\n\nYou are both TAs but because of your action, you became the bigger A.", "YTA; the other girl was in the wrong too, but you made it worse with an immature response. There are better ways to deal with that kind of behaviour without causing a scene and damaging someone's property.", "YTA.

She literally spent 2k to ruin her wedding \ud83d\ude02 but it got ruined for her instead \ud83d\ude04", "NTA, I\u2019d block her number.", "You might be the A here but it's justified.", "NTA\n\nI'd take this post down though in case she sues because it shows you did it intentionally where as you could say it was accidental and possibly not have to pay.\n\nI wouldn't pay, I'd make her sue me for it.  Good for you.", "I will say her other 3 bridesmaids were her two sisters and her best friend, who all told me. I got to her before any of them could. She was the last of the guests to make her arrival and she arrived \"late\" even tho she rode in with her parents She walked down the aisle quite literally after her brother was at the alter and the bridesmaids and groomsmen where lining up to make our entrance entrance.", "Came here to say the same thing: I'd want proof the dress was actually designer and she had paid $2000 for it. Otherwise the cousin-SIL is just trying for even more attention. I'd also want proof that the stain couldn't be removed. I've got worse out of more delicate fabrics.\n\nESH - OP for spilling food on and potentially ruining a dress. The cousin-SIL for clearly attention seeking and breaking the rules everyone attending a wedding knows:\n\nDont wear white\n\nDont wear black\n\nDont wear the same color as the bridesmaids\n\nDont dress like a ho\n\nAnd also (although open to correction on this because I only just recently heard it) dont wear red unless you're a bridesmaid and that's the color they're wearing. Apparently it means you've 'had relations' with the groom.\n\n\\*All these rules do not apply if specifically asked to wear any of the above by the bride and groom, but by them only.", "Unfortunately there was no security  as this wedding was at our families farm. And they rented out tents to do the wedding.  I do want to say she was told multiple times that invitations aside not to wear white. Her brother even said it in a joking manner at a BBQ  3 weeks before the wedding. \"None of yall try and upstage my wife, and I we paid a whole lot of money to be upstaged, and if we get upstaged, I'm going to send yall the bill for the wedding\" and my cousin had told her husband to be she was worried his sister was going to make an all about me speech. Since she asked her brother if she could make a speech after the best man and maid of honor speeches and he said no bc the only other ppl making a speech  are the parents if they want too.", "  I will say this to my defense, I offered to pay, and I even offered to pay the cleaning fee too if she  showed me where she got it and how much I'd pay her. But she doesn't want that she wants me to pay double, and she isn't even  going to buy herself a new one bc ppl already saw her in it. Her brother talked to her after the wedding and he said she was wearing a very inappropriate  dress and it wasn't even the dress she had first shown him.", "To be fair, there are people that can be hired to spill on wedding guests that do pull this.
