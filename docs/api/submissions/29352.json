People started to notice how wearing the same type of dress, or wearing white in general, detracted attention from the bride. Social norms made this a faux pas on the part of the invitees.\n\nMen's dress clothing has always been similar to each other. Suit coat, pants, shoes-- all look kind of the same.

She\u2019s not engaged, she just thought it \u201clooked pretty.\u201d\n\n* You spend months planning a solo backpacking trip to Europe after graduating college, as a way of celebrating this major milestone and your entrance into adulthood. You tell your parents, and they decide they want to go on the very same trip, taking advantage of all your planning and bargain-hunting, because it sounds fun. But don\u2019t worry, they made sure their hotel rooms will be on different floors.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t actually end up crossing paths (which is a big \u201cif\u201d), just knowing you\u2019re there will detract from the feeling of specialness. There\u2019s a reason why couples travel to far flung destinations for their honeymoons - because they want to feel like the only two people in the world, to exist in a fantasy space for just a little while\u2026 to have a once-in-a-lifetime experience that just the two of them share.\n\nIt\u2019s like with the diamond ring example - you might not run into this friend all the time, she might not always be wearing the ring\u2026 but the very fact that she decided to get the exact same ring is going to feel a bit deflating and disrespectful.

Anyway, good luck with that.", "And that\u2019s not fair to the sister and her new husband who are going there because they got a great deal. It is special to go somewhere exotic.

Could you imagine accidentally seeing them all gimped up.  Sometimes you have no idea what people do behind doors.\n\nMaybe they\u2019re trying something new and really worried about failing and looking foolish x.

Two who live near us in the northeast, and a college friend who lives near Tampa. Not in a resort, in the middle of Magic Kingdom!", "Yeah I was going to say, there aren't that many things to do at a resort so the only saving grace is that they aren't there at the same time, which probably will happen once or twice. \n\nBut they don't want OP there and that should be all OP needs to know. So YTA if they don't change their plans. I get they don't understand why it is a big deal, I don't understand a lot of social stuff but if my sister said \"I don't want you to be in the same resort at the same time while I am on my honeymoon\" I'd be like \"ah, sorry! Didn't realize my mistake I'll fix it.\"", "This. I know that my sister delayed her honeymoon a month and a half and my bestie delayed hers two weeks.", "Heres another I have no idea why you are being downvoted", "No one should have messaged you saying something like that.  Jesus Christ.\n\nI think going to the same resort at the same time was a bit strange.  If it's really that great of a place, just go another time. Sounds like you cancelled....\n\nThere are tons of fabulous resorts though so I'm sure you'll find a great one for vacation.", "NTA as you tell it, just perhaps unfamiliar with honeymoons.  Any couple would feel constant pressure to look out for you, having been told you would be there, and just that is enough to encorach on the post marital bonding.  If you hadn't told them, though, it is still possible you would have seen them.  They see you, and either you speak and they feel encroached upon or you don't and they are left wondering why you are there.  It would be awkward, trust me, and the law of social awkwardness makes it 99% likely you would have bumped into them.", "good job OP with the update !", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole, at all.\nWho cares where you go esp if you don\u2019t plan on even seeing them.", "Just wanna say yikes some comments in this post are truly disturbing, you guys might need to go outside touch some grass. The projection is off the charts.", "NTA. You just shouldn\u2019t have said anything", "NTA - I find the other comments bizarre.\n\nYou aren't allowed to go somewhere just because someone else related to you is? What?\n\nYou aren't even joining them...", "Honestly? NTA I\u2019m sorry that so many people attacked you so fucking hard that you canceled your vacation. The wedding? All about her. Her and her husband\u2018s honeymoon? All about them. But the only day that you are obligated to be all about her is her wedding day. People can down vote the shit out of me, I honestly don\u2019t fucking care, you guys are fucking crazy for being this torn up about something so fucking stupid. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re trying to take the limelight from her. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re trying to make everything about you. Honestly, after that I wouldn\u2019t even fucking show up to my sister\u2018s wedding and I\u2019d still go on my fucking vacation.", "except she didn\u2019t according to her edit. way to spread misinformation and send more vitriol her way. you\u2019re apart of the problem.", "Now tbf, while it's wrong for her to downvote YTA comments, isn't that just what the reddit is going to do to every comment that says N.T.A?\n\nLike, I agree with y.t.a, but I do think it's hypocritical this sub will agree with you, while doing exactly what you criticised.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s being territorial, it\u2019s just sheer discomfort. Imagine trying to be in a romantic mood with your brand new husband & your sister keeps popping up! Sitting by the pool and there\u2019s your sister on a sun lounger on the other side. Having a candlelit dinner but you can see your sister sitting a few tables away. Taking a sunset stroll on the beach and run into your sister. It would be *so* uncomfortable.", "I think it might be because of the deal", "Had a gf of a friend of my now husband did that with a very pale blue. His best man offered to spill red wine on her for me.", "I don't think I'd ever speak to someone again who did this to me. Sister or not. This is so shitty and selfish.", "Hate boner + speculation = fact", "Take the time to research more into social norms. My younger brother has very high functioning autism and I always found it interesting how different social norms  I just picked up on automatically whereas he had to be explicitly told. \n\n(Random example, one time he and I were at Walmart and he forgot to buy something he had meant to pick up and asked if we had time to still buy it and get back home in time because I had plans. I said \u201cYup, just hurry\u201d so he ran his 6\u20194 ass at full tilt through Walmart while everyone watched wondering in confusion. I explained to him afterwards not to run full tilt in indoor areas and he asked \u201cWhy?\u201d And I had to tell him \u201cGenerally adults only run indoors at the gym, or if there\u2019s an emergency or if they\u2019re chasing someone or being chased. Those last three scenarios are scary to people\u201d he had never considered this, but to me it was obvious).", "Ah, thanks \ud83d\ude04", "Yeah I thought this same thing"]}
