I had new neighbors move in a couple days ago, and it has just been usual moving in banging around noises which is cool. \n\nI get home today to see a kid on my back porch and stairs which I have a good 7 stairs and half of them are covered in vines so it almost serves as a gate, point being it was not a step or two. A woman was standing about 5 yards behind where my stairs end watching him, but not close enough to catch him had he fallen down my stairs. I shrugged it off as exploring their new neighborhood, but was still concerned for safety and liability reasons. \n\nI went to take my recycling out a couple minutes later to see my recycling bin was chock full to where it could not close. A couple boxes were placed beside my bin, and 2 storage bins beside those. I knew I had only had maybe a layer on bottles and boxes in my bin, so I opened the lid the rest of the way to see boxes that were not mine. I could not even see where my stuff ended and their began, as it was completely covered. I separated what garbage they had thrown into it (despite my garbage bin being beside my recycling bin like might as well if you  are going to.) A blender box was on top which when I moved it, I could hear broken glass, which is not supposed to be garbage or recycling. So, I managed to put my recycling on top of theirs, took some pictures for proof and took it to the curb. \n\nI should add, my recycling and garbage bins are beside my porch hugging my back wall, about 3 or 4 feet from where their concrete patio ends, and about 15 feet from their stairs. Their marked garbage can is by the curb empty and two unmarked recycling bins are in visible sight at their disposal for use. \n\nI emailed our landlord immediately addressing my concerns. My GF says I was too quick to email my landlord and I should have spoke to my neighbors. I do not want any personal problems w/ them granted they just moved in and I cannot afford to break my lease, so I hoped my landlord would send out a general \u201cdo not do..\u201d email as is occasionally done.

They trespassed and used your bins without permission. This is exactly the kind of thing your landlord should address.", "NTA OMG I HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS EXACT CRAP! My neighbours had done this exact same thing and they would fill our bins up with stuff that I didn\u2019t even recognise! It was full of broken glass and all kinds of crap and we didn\u2019t catch on until our bins started having red stickers stuck on them by the garbage collectors which was unusual because we never had them before and thats when we started checking! We called the council and as usual they said \u2018can\u2019t do anything about it\u2019 so we took matters into our own hands! We caught them throwing stuff in our bins at 7:00 in the morning and we told them to pick it right back up and put it in their own bins! Never had a problem since then!! You should call them out for their shit as well!", "NTA\n\nQuite frankly, they should not be using your bin. The fact they did so without even asking says that they probably will not listen if you politely ask them not to.\n\nEscalation is the correct move here. You've done nothing wrong.", "NTA. The kid's mom was there with him, which means she's **teaching him how to use other people's stuff without permission**. You did the right thing going to the landlord.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou handled that well.", "NTA.  Give them an inch and they will take a mile.

They told us, we apologized and were embarrassed, but we immediately made it right by getting another bin for our own use.\n\nHowever, this seems a lot more intentional given the situation, especially since they had to go out of their way and enter your part of the property to use yours. I don\u2019t blame you for not feeling comfortable confronting them and immediately having beef with your neighbors, especially given the amount of entitlement they are showing here with this behavior. \n\nNTA", "NTA they were trespassing on your property and actually using your property for their own benefit. But I think I would\u2019ve gone and talk to them in person so it\u2019s not to have bad feelings between neighbors.

Given the spate of innocent people being shot at or killed for an honest mistake, confronting strangers about their clear violation of your space may hold more risks than rewards. Proper channel was to notify the landlord. The landlord's word is law as to what is acceptable behavior on the property. And there is a written record of the transgression, if any documentation of it will be needed in future.", "NTA. They suck. I would personally have let them use the recycling once because they are moving, but acted on a second violation. But you don\u2019t have to. Anyone normal would surely have left a note to say they are sorry they have a load of recycling because they just moved and they won\u2019t use yours again. As for the trespassing, from what I read on here it looks like it\u2019s less of a violation in the US? Because people say they have open yards and unknown kids walk in them. I\u2019d call the police in seconds if a stranger was in my garden but I suspect values may vary by location.", "NTA", "Nta but I\u2019m petty AF so I would of put all their garbage/recycling on their door step I have before when someone put all their garden waste in my garden bin I tipped it back in their garden she confronted me a few days later I was fuming she had gone through my yard to the back yard unbolted the gate took my bin filled it then put it back it was only after I\u2019d mown the lawn that I noticed it was full of hedge trimmings she\u2019s the only neighbour with a hedge \n\nYou have to put a stop to their entitlement at the start otherwise they just take the pee", "But you do need to say something immediately about the trespassing.
