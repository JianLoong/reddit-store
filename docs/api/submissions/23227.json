Fast forward to a few days ago and the view changed to a lot of shaming directed at him, him standing tall, and his siblings going to bat for us (which didn\u2019t change anything). The past few days have been back and forth of seeing what else could work but the limited hotel/Airbnb availability in this rural area was past our budgets and his parents not budging. We were told we could sleep in separate rooms, get a hotel, or not come at all. This has felt unwelcome at best and judgmental/disrespectful to us at most.\n\nI\u2019ve continually given my partner the option of me not going because I\u2019ve always known this familial relationship would have tension since I wasn\u2019t raised in or follow this belief system, and he continually told me we needed to have a unified front. After the millionth back and forth, he decided he\u2019d like to go alone at the tail end (when I\u2019m working) to spend time with the rest of the family as there were no feasible options of me going with him earlier. This felt disappointing since he had expressed standing in it together, but I had given the option. \n\nToday I decided the simplest solution rather than going back and forth with his family anymore is simply not to go, and told him it was hard for me to hear he\u2019d still go even though he had told me otherwise before but that I understood. I also told him this situation would come up again and again and without a firm boundary the pattern will repeat with them. I encouraged him to still go and stick to this decision and we\u2019ll move along and will make better plans for the next time this sort of thing pops up (holidays and us telling them we\u2019re moving in together in a few months - not at the same time).\n\nSo Reddit - AITA for seemingly placing my partner in positions where he has to choose between me or his family and bowing out of a trip instead of compromising over sharing a room?", "created_utc": 1690415544, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15aly5c/aita_for_bowing_out_of_a_trip_that_wouldnt_allow/", "score": 109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That way, you aren't depending on them and therefore caught by their rules.  You have your own space.

You are never an AH for skipping an event where you are made to feel uncomfortable or unwelcome.  Asking someone to choose between you and family is a grey area to me.  If you and your partner eventually get married, this particular issue will go away, but I'm certain that others will arise.

I mean I'm not religious but it seems like they knew they wouldn't be sleeping in the same room before hand so that's why they asked.  \n\nThis is their beliefs and it's their trip.

Then is mad when he does.", "I think that they are obnoxious and controlling because OP and partner clearly don\u2019t follow all of the parent\u2019s beliefs. There is a point when the parents have to let the adult children follow their own beliefs and not micromanage or shame them if they want to have a good relationship with their children. The parents are trying to force their beliefs onto the adult son and OP. That\u2019s not going to end well.\n\nEdit: OP and partner are not teenagers or young adults. They are adults in their 30\u2019s. The parents are really controlling.", "I agree with you. This is more like \u201cmy house, my rules\u201d and not you have to do things my way.

You telling him your disappointed comments that he would go when you are not able to is AH and a bit controlling.", "Very gentle, YTA. Only for resenting him for changing his mind. But I could also say the same for him. \nHonestly, I wouldn't have been surprised about him changing his mind, but that's also me assuming he doesn't get the time to see his siblings/family as much as he wants to.\n\nI'm the same age as you, and essentially more so in the same position as him (being in a family where the parents are more \"traditional\"), and if I didn't get the chance to see family as often as I'd like then I'd ditch my boyfriend for the week. I've gone on plenty of family trips/vacas since we started dating because simply put- he's not part of the family yet and I won't let him hold me back from any kind of trip (he wouldn't dare say something, but I won't let myself regret leaving him for a week)\n\nIt's not wrong of your boyfriend to put family before you when you're not completely part of that dynamic yet (in their eyes being engaged/married), and maybe that affected his final decision. \n\nPlan a separate trip with him to make up for it if anything.

The parents are providing the vacation accommodations (through their like-minded friend) and want to be able to adhere to their own belief system in their own (borrowed) space. They have no objection to the son and his gf making their own arrangements that better suit their beliefs/preferences, or declining to participate in the vacation entirely. Frankly, the son and gf insisting that the parents accommodate a sleeping arrangement that is against their beliefs, is much more inline with \u201cinflicting their beliefs\u201d on someone else, than is the parents refusal to allow the young couple to dictate what they will do while staying in the vacation home being provided through the parents. \nAgain, fully agree the parents are goofy, just respectfully disagree they are \u201cinflicting\u201d their beliefs in this scenario.", "Nah, some people would be understanding of a person changing their mind in difficult situation.", "Yes but when it comes to someone family its gonna cause feelings.", "One of the things that really annoys me about this attitude is it shows such an obsession with sex. i would feel the same - not that I needed to bang my partner (any anyway we're married, and anyway his parents are dead and mine aren't delusional), and in fact I'd happily refrain if there was any chance of it disturbing people, but the comfort factor.  If you go away with someone else's family, in my experience the evening is often when you debrief the day: \"did I annoy your mum with that joke?\" \"is your brother always that homophobic?\", whatever. It's the person you're closest to, rather than being alone, or as you say with a relative you barely know. NTA, ofc.", "NTA\n\nYour partner put themselves in this position.", "NTA. \n\nThis is just one problem. There will be many more when dating an individual from a fundamentalist Christian background. \n\nGet ready for your partner to side with his family on a lot more issues in the future. You are unlikely to share any common ground with these people, and will likely lose to their interests.", "This was the rule in my mother's house. Unmarried people didn't sleep together. We all knew it. We all respected it. She had no problems with our partners. She simply did not believe that premarital sex was right. As it was her house and because we loved and respected her, we abided by the rule. When she visited her unmarried but cohabitating children, she had no issues with them sleeping together. Their house, their rules. Mutual respect goes a very long way towards getting along with inlaws. They respect OPs place in their sons life, they simply refuse to give them a place to do something they believe is wrong,...hence the welcoming of them to get a hotel room and join them during the day. Insisting on sleeping together, unmarried, knowing that they believe it is wrong, is just as wrong as them coming into your home and doing something against your beliefs. This is also not their home. It is the home of a couple who believe the same as them and that would be extremely disrespectful to the owners who trust that their home won't be used for something that is against their beliefs. Insisting they change their belief system to accommodate you is just as wrong as them insisting that you change yours...which they are NOT doing, they simply refuse to actively facilitate it.", "NTA, you wasn\u2019t comfortable with going and that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m glad you also chose to be a bigger person and not allowed your feelings of getting hurt really bother you when he said he was going.

You didn\u2019t place him in this position, his family\u2019s ridiculous fundamentalist religious beliefs did. You are grown adults in a relationship.
