You got him what he asked for. It's unfortunate that you didn't realize that he might be triggered by the term \"Five Little Pigs.\" You might consider apologizing to him for the title as a way of reassuring him that your intent was to give him a gift that he would enjoy and not to trigger him.", "By his and your sister's reaction I am assuming he was bullied by some variation of being called a pig, and the word is, even after two years, stilla trigger for him. That is so sad and unfortunate. but unless you were directly told this, you had no way of knowing.   \nTalk to him.Reassure him.   \nYour mutual love of books should be able to overcome this. You are nta.", "Nta, but maybe sit down with the kid and apologise for hurting hid feelings and let him know you didn't even consider a connection between the book and his bullies and that you would never intentionally say or do anything unkind to him! \n\nBullies fucking suck and I hope he knows he's got people in his corner", "NAH. I do think it was a little thoughtless (I.e. I can understand why nephew was upset and sister was sensitive to her son\u2019s feelings), but it doesn\u2019t make you an asshole unless you did it on purpose, even as a joke.", "NTA. This is isn\u2019t AH behavior. Just assure him that you didn\u2019t intend to hurt him in anyway.", "NTA\n\nHe asked for a Poirot book, you got him one.", "My husband bought me 5 crystal pigs to represent our family. I laughed but did not feel insulted. He thought they were cute and it didn't even occur to him that he was calling us pigs. I love those pigs!", "NTA\n\nyou did nothing wrong.\n\nhe is traumatized but he is going to need to find ways to understanding that what people say and what they mean can mean two different things and that you had no harm intended. \n\nThere's no one to blame but the bullies.", "NTA. You can't account for all possible reactions a person might have, especially when you don't see them daily. It's ridiculous of them to think anyone should even be able to do so. Agatha Christie passed away decades ago; there are only so many Poirot novels. You got him one like he asked.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Bullying is terrible and maybe this book can help him reclaim that word and attach more positive memories with it", "NTA, but this might be a time to talk to him about life, the whole book situation, and how he should be proud of himself, no matter what others might think and say. \n\nI see how the title can be understood as problematic, but the book wasn't bought with malicious intent.\n\nSee if you can build him up, work on your relationship, and help him with his self-esteem, so that next time something like this happens it won't face him at all", "NTA. Is your nephew going to be triggered every time he sees or hears the word pig? You didn't do it with bad intentions. Yes, it reminded him of bullying, but that will happen all the time in his life, since people don't really forget that trauma.", "NAH", "NTA. You chose a novel that you believed your nephew would enjoy. Period.\n\nNot to deny that we all have our personal traumas as we progress through life. However, those traumas are primarily our individual business to deal with. It's not as if you bought your nephew a manual about the Atkins diet.\n\nYou cannot be expected to know that buying what you believe to be a good detective novel would have greater implications for your nephew. \n\nYour sister is wrong. You are not stupid. In this case, consider being the bigger person and not validating this tempest in a teapot.", "OH, PLEASE!  I won't blame the nephew for having a reaction to the title due to past bullying, but this is taking things too far. Can his Mama never bring home bacon?  \n\nHumans are resilient beings.  If a book title causes someone to spiral, therapy is the only solution.  And OP is not stupid, or inconsiderate.  This is just obnoxious. \n\n Five Little Pigs is my personal favorite.  I hope your nephew reads it.", "NTA. Poirot is awesome and your nephew has good taste. However, Agatha Christie\u2019s opinions are all through her books and he\u2019s likely to be triggered by something in almost every story, this is a learning opportunity for the nephew- the world is full of different things and not all of them are 100% pleasant to everyone. For example, the story I was reading last night has a line about how government payments to the unemployed should be stopped as it makes it too easy for the servants to leave!", "NTA. You got him something he asked for, not realizing how he would react to the title.", "Maybe?  if weight was an issue, you could have chosen a more less offensive book title.", "This is fucking ridiculous. NTA.", "I fail to see the connection between the book and the bullying.", "Next time ask him what sort of characters he likes i.e animals, alien and so on and what sort of story he would like to read.\n\nDownload Bing or some sort of A.I program.\n\nPut in the ideas in that when your happy with it print it out he will love it.", "A stupid comment made to my brother at that age has resulted in decades of anorexia/bulemia.  So I\u2019m going with YTA on this one.", "YTA\n\nSounds pretty damn inconsiderate.\n\nFor those in thread (y'all are gross, btw) who insist this isn't a big deal and he got what he asked for, imagine if it was your niece, who'd been sexually assaulted, and she asked for a novel.  Then, imagine you bought her one--within the parameters--which featured a sexual assault, or titled: \"Shhh--You're Mine Now\".", "NTA. You thought of the novel, not of the title. \n\nIt is unfortunate that the title hearkens to your nephew's bullying... but it is still a great novel.\n\nYou did right. Your nephew cannot be shielded from every hurtful thing out there in the world.", "NTA you wanted to give him a new book and share one of your favorites. Some assurance to him that that was your only intent might ease his mind.", "NAH. But unintentionally insensitive. This should be easily solved with a heartfelt apology and an explanation that it was unintentional and that it was one of your favorites.", "NTA but definitely talk with him and say that you didn't mean any harm by it and just thought the story is considered one of the best ones and thats why you got it. Tell him his weight never crosses your mind and you love him and just thought he would like the book.\n\nOffer to buy him a new one and take him out to lunch just the two of you", "NAH", "This is a great teaching moment for the kid. \n\nApologize and explain that some bad people turn evryday words into insults and we should be able to undrstand that the word is not the problem but the people who used it as an insult.", "NTA.  Was your nephew bullied by calling him a pig? If so, did you even know this? Sounds to me that your sister is being ridiculous and overly coddling her son--she's probably making the effect of bullying worse by bringing it up two years later.  It's not as if the book is about weight or bullying. I saw your other post from three months ago about how your sister freaked out at the idea of your nephew reading Agatha Christies, that they were too advanced for him. Sounds like this is more about your sister's weird ideas of what is inappropriate for her son to read, than about his past bullying. And for the record, there's nothing wrong with reading Agatha Christies at 12 and 13. I read all of them by age 12. I can't imagine what she will do when he reads a modern YA novel!", "NTA- as long as this was unintentional, then you\u2019re not an ass. And I\u2019m sure this was unintentional. \n\nThis is a quick fix, too! Get him another book and ask him to trade.\n\nAlso grab him a copy of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes or The Hounds of Baskerville. Amazon has a version of The Adventures in modern English, too. I can\u2019t link it but search The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Modern English version. Every mystery fan should at least try Sherlock Holmes! He\u2019s the OG, after all.", "NAH. You didn't do it on purpose. I get being affected by things that bring bullying to mind though. There's a truck stop in Arizona that has the same name as what my bullies used to call me. Your nephew is young, but they are going to realize that they will be inadvertently confronted with things that bring the bullying to mind. It sucks, but it can't be avoided.", "OP knew, and said that they didn't think of it.", "Best answer imho", "So who is the asshole in this situation?", "I have a pig bead bracelet my DIL'S mom gave me for my birthday. I put it on thinking it was textured pink beads. Then I looked closer...", "I love your sentiment, but let's not forget we're talking about a 13 year old here. Hopefully he'll be able to handle these things the way you do now, but he still has to get there.", "No where does it suggests the kid thinks everyone should account for possible reactions. He was briefly taken aback (which is fair) and went about his day.", "I\u2019m guessing he might have been called a \u2018little pig\u2019?", "Really?  \"Pig\" is a common slur for overweight people.", "The pigs in the story are not actual pigs, nor are they fat - Poirot calls them that because of the nursery rhyme.", "Sometimes there isn\u2019t an asshole, just a poor case of miscommunication", "Pink piggies can be adorable. :)", "Pig is not a slur, but it is a rude name and a way people bully fat people.", "It's obviously not the content that was the issue, but rather the obviously insensitive title.  Or did you miss the OP saying:\n\n> *\"He was a little startled when he saw the book yesterday. Looked taken aback and momentarily upset. But then he smiled and thanked me for the gift.\"*\n\nwhich makes it pretty clear the title is what caused the issue?\n\nYou seemed to be able to read the novel; might give the post--and my comment--another try, though.", "Yes, but people are supposed to vote NAH in that situation. If you vote NTA, you feel either the sister or the nephew is an asshole.", "LMGTFY:\n\n> *\"slur, noun: an insinuation or allegation about someone that is likely to insult them or damage their reputation; a derogatory or insulting term applied to particular group of people.\"*\n\nr/confidentlyincorrect while also literally supporting what I said.  What a rollercoaster.", "I was referring to the sister's, not the nephew's, reaction. She jumped to conclusions based on the title. The nephew would have figured out it had nothing to do with pigs/obesity by reading the blurb, within seconds of getting the book.", "NAH\n\nNo asshole here", "Or, he had already reached the conclusion that: \"Auntie meant well, but wow that was inconsiderate considering she knew what I'd gone through.\"\n\nAlso, like most other avid book readers, we don't always read the blurb.  Same as people who don't watch movie trailers--which have become entire movies played out in 45 seconds."]}
