An ex, that I assume he hasn\u2019t had contact with in 5 years, all of a sudden needs his support? She should have plenty of enough support from her own family & friends. I could ALMOST understand him going to the funeral if he was close with her dad AND it was local, but traveling out of state & leaving you & an infant behind- no way.", "NTA for seeing \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 and being concerned. It would be one thing if he just planned to take two days and go to the funeral on his own but this plan of traveling with her and \u2018supporting\u2019 her makes me uncomfortable. I think you do \u201dget it.\u201d But if he\u2019s going to leave you and his 3 month old to go running back to her and resume his old relationship, better to know now.

But I do know if it were my husband it would be him genuinely wanting to support a friend.  However, I would set boundaries.  I think I would probably say get the information for the funeral and the baby and I will come with you.  Mini family vacation for a couple days and we can all go to the funeral.  If you aren't willing to support her with us around--your family--then you cannot go.  If new baby is too much to travel with right now, then express how much you need him and his help with the baby.  His spouse and their needs come first.", "NTA, a 3-month-old is a lot of work. Can another family member help you out while he leaves? If yes, you may want to consider trusting him as a new stage in your relationship. However, I think your feelings of suspicion aren't totally unjustified (grief can make people want comfort in an irrational way, and this is pretty far for him to go for this - my dad died a couple years ago, and one friend two hours away came, but it's not that normal to expect a 10-hr round trip for that). I would just say be aware that, whatever happens, distrust can break a relationship, and it goes both ways. Rather than making it an issue of trust (at a certain point your partner is trustworthy or he isn't and it may take a leap of faith to bridge this gap), I'd make this about how new your family is, this is an important time for the baby's development and bonding, and you personally need his support.

It was really very thoughtful.", "YTA - when my father passed my ex-BF from college, so we are talking 10+ years since we were together, drove across the state to pay respects to my father, since he was part of the family for 4ish years.

We live in different continents and are just platonic (15y later now). \n\nAll this to say, boundaries. You\u2019re not wrong.\n\nAnd it\u2019s possible to be that person for some ex. Mine and I just know at heart we have each others best interest and he knows how to make me feel better. We wouldn\u2019t be a good relationship, we know this. We are good friends. Idk your fianc\u00e9 of course, and even my ex had cheated on me to be fair, so can\u2019t be sure but I can say not all of us would do that. If that\u2019s your concern.", "NTA. At the very least you should be invited/welcomed to join him. \n\nBroke up with my ex in 2017. Moved on, started dating a mutual friend(now wife) got married in 2020. I am very good friends with my ex and ex\u2019s family and even spend some holidays with my family and ex\u2019s family. My wife is comfortable with it and has her own relationship with my ex and ex\u2019s parents and brother. Ex and I are completely at peace with our history and have both moved on, no weirdness or drama just really good friends. Still, I just wouldn\u2019t even consider going off or out of town with the ex because I don\u2019t want my wife to ever be stressed or hurt. Even though there no feelings or chance that I or ex would cross any lines, an ex is an ex. \n\nFriends or not, no contact for 5 years or talking every day\u2026 doesn\u2019t matter. You and the baby (congrats!) come first.", "INFO: have you asked him if this is done out of spite? Just to see her suffer because her dads gone?", "NTA \nAfter 5 years she calls him?  There\u2019s no one else to \u201csupport\u201d her during this time?  Sounds fishy to me.  I don\u2019t think he should go and if he insists, you go with him. Make your presence known.", "NTA, he\u2019s gonna cheat", "It just happened.. i was comforting her when suddenly she kissed me and one thing led to another..", "This. If he was close to the dad and felt a need/desire to attend for his own reasons, I could understand that. But he is not and cannot be his ex\u2019s support system anymore.", "It's either gonna be a hard no for OP or it will end being a hard on for the hubby", "I mean it almost doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s genuinely going to support a friend. His baby is 3 months old. If he goes, OP is gonna get no sleep for however long he\u2019s gone. His focus should be on supporting his baby and his current family.", "That's a good idea.", "Let him go? Just like that? I mean if he doesn\u2019t go to the funeral, then there\u2019s definitely a chance they can be repaired.", "It depends on factors, like does he jave kids with his Ex? Or how long were they together.", "Something tells me you believe in gender roles?", "I was wondering if I was going to find anyone that said YTA. I don't think this is  red flag or cheating scandal or bad parenting move at all... he could still love the parents since he was in their lives. My partners ex came to his mother's funeral and I didn't feel weird about it and her fiance encouraged her to go. There's nothing wrong with it :p", "No reason why someone would downvote this. If you think it\u2019s okay to go out of town with an ex to support them at a funeral while living with your child\u2019s mother/father you are not right. It\u2019s not okay.", "As satisfying as this might be, an honest conversation is going to be a lot more helpful to the relationship than trying to trick/catch each other.", "This \u261d\ud83c\udffb tell him, you want to be his moral support", "Probably not appropriate to have her and the baby there", "A shoulder to cry on is a dick to ride on.", "I\u2019m one of those people who have gotten together with someone after a funeral. Something about life being fleeting and being in pain and getting comfort. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t feel guilty, but it\u2019s important to know this happens so I would be super wary go with him.", "Links please; this sounds like absolute misandrist bollocks.  Unless it\u2019s that 80% of young men routinely carry condoms with them (say in a wallet) and also takes said wallet to funerals, but that would be a highly selective wording.", "\u201cIf he\u2019s an absent father and occasionally plays with the baby it\u2019s fine\u201d fixed it for you.", "Yep. But add that he can't send his regrets and then get all Mr. Crabbypants because his gf won't \"let\" him go to the funeral.", "Seriously, people on Reddit are massively jealous and insecure. Maybe I missed it, but I don\u2019t think it specified in the post that they haven\u2019t been talking over the last five years, just that he seemed to mention her a lot in the beginning of the relationship. I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m projecting my own experience as someone whose ex is one of my closest friends and in whom I have absolutely no non-platonic interest (he got married a few weeks ago, I\u2019ve met his now-wife, I\u2019ve gone to Thanksgiving at his parents\u2019 house with them there), but it seems like a failure of imagination on a LOT of people\u2019s parts that they think a situation like that is actively undesirable. Y\u2019all are missing out on meaningful connections because of your paranoia.", "Then she can change her mind, and if he\u2019s happy to take her then she hasn\u2019t got anything to worry about", "That isn\u2019t the point tho is it?", "I mean maybe, but if he hasn\u2019t talked to ex in 5 years, he probably doesn\u2019t know or speak to anyone who will be at the funeral anyway. So does it really matter what he says when he says he won\u2019t be going? I agree that he shouldn\u2019t be crabby to GF though. The dude is either completely insensitive or wanted to get with his ex. I don\u2019t know which one, and they\u2019re both bad.", "Methinks you\u2019re trying to pull out of this. I presume you\u2019re Catholic as your timing\u2019s terrible\u2026", "When op explicitly tells her partner that ex talk makes her uncomfortable, and wanting it to stop, his silence about dad says nothing other than that he was respecting her wishes."]}
