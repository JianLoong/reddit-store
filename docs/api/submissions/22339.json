An ex, that I assume he hasn\u2019t had contact with in 5 years, all of a sudden needs his support? She should have plenty of enough support from her own family & friends. I could ALMOST understand him going to the funeral if he was close with her dad AND it was local, but traveling out of state & leaving you & an infant behind- no way.", "NTA for seeing \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 and being concerned. It would be one thing if he just planned to take two days and go to the funeral on his own but this plan of traveling with her and \u2018supporting\u2019 her makes me uncomfortable. I think you do \u201dget it.\u201d But if he\u2019s going to leave you and his 3 month old to go running back to her and resume his old relationship, better to know now.

But I do know if it were my husband it would be him genuinely wanting to support a friend.  However, I would set boundaries.  I think I would probably say get the information for the funeral and the baby and I will come with you.  Mini family vacation for a couple days and we can all go to the funeral.  If you aren't willing to support her with us around--your family--then you cannot go.  If new baby is too much to travel with right now, then express how much you need him and his help with the baby.  His spouse and their needs come first.", "NTA, a 3-month-old is a lot of work. Can another family member help you out while he leaves? If yes, you may want to consider trusting him as a new stage in your relationship. However, I think your feelings of suspicion aren't totally unjustified (grief can make people want comfort in an irrational way, and this is pretty far for him to go for this - my dad died a couple years ago, and one friend two hours away came, but it's not that normal to expect a 10-hr round trip for that). I would just say be aware that, whatever happens, distrust can break a relationship, and it goes both ways. Rather than making it an issue of trust (at a certain point your partner is trustworthy or he isn't and it may take a leap of faith to bridge this gap), I'd make this about how new your family is, this is an important time for the baby's development and bonding, and you personally need his support.

It was really very thoughtful.", "YTA - when my father passed my ex-BF from college, so we are talking 10+ years since we were together, drove across the state to pay respects to my father, since he was part of the family for 4ish years.

If you cant trust him, then were you really ready to have a child together?  I think there is too much you arent telling us, that means we cant make a fair judgement, but of course, thats going to be impossible given the sensitivity of the situation anyway, so i am not expecting you to.  Anyone who definitively says YTA or YNTA, really isnt being fair, either way.  You can either take the risk and trust him, or show him that you dont.

Sometimes you get so lucky and end up with these incredible relationships that live past the romantic relationship, but there\u2019s no fucking way I would be going to that funeral to support my ex. it would be to mourn and nothing more. the fact that she\u2019s ask him for his support, and he\u2019s willing to give up at this point is big red flags, especially when you guys have little infant who I can almost guarantee doesn\u2019t sleep through the night yet", "NTA.

There is a reason people are in your past & not everyone in your past deserves a place in your current life. Plus it seems like the reason for going is more to support the ex rather than because of the deceased - an ex that he hasn\u2019t even stayed friends with. While I understand the ex\u2019s grief, it not a justification to dig up everyone with any possible connection. If that was the way to go then every funeral would be overflowing with ex\u2019s - ex-friends, ex-spouses, ex-coworkers. Your support should come from love ones  -  people you are close to & who currently have meaning in your life. This man has a fianc\u00e9 & 3 month old baby. They should be his priority.", "He said he's going to be emotional support to woman, not to honor her father.", "A key difference is that your ex-BF came to pay respects, vs. OP's situation is a little different.  Her BF led with his reason for going is to provide  emotional support to his ex GF.    Also, a newborn at home is an emotionally fragile and tender time.  I wish he wanted to be with his baby,  and be protective of the mother of his child.    Or proud. I wish he said his primary purpose in going is  to honor and say goodbye to the deceased.  He could suggest all 3 of them go together for two days, and then he could attend the funeral while his infant and his girlfriend rest in their hotel room.", "This!!

I, too, have deep mistrust of my own family as a support system, and it's taken years of work to break out of that.  \n\nBut just so you know, you're simply wrong. There are family members out there who would drop everything to help care for a 3 month old out of necessity. \n\nAlso a 3 month old can be cared for by one parent. There you have no excuses on making that claim. Source: single parents exist.", "Being emotionally supportive to her while she grieves her father would be honoring her father in a lot of communities.

When you break up with someone, that means the relationship is severed, end of story. It doesn't sound like he's done with her either, honestly. This is a really bad idea, going back there for the funeral. Her Dad ain't gonna care, and she is only gonna cause trouble.", "NTA - this is a slippery slope. He had a relationship with her family, and I can see him having sympathy or maybe even some grief, but he seems more into wanting to be there for her. And that's where old feelings start to rekindle. \n\nThe bigger issue is that they are back in contact with each other because this funeral gives them a reason to be. And they can continue talking.

It makes sense he may be upset about that if he did have some relationship with him when they were together. However, him being her support system when they supposedly haven't spoken in 5 years is a bit suspect. If he was very hung up on her, he may be using this as an excuse to see her again at this point. And maybe she is hoping he will come because she regrets their breakup.\n\nI don't know. You are right to be a little cautious of this as condolences and a card for the family would suffice if, again. He hasn't spoken to her or her family members in 5 years. I worry he actually does talk to them and just never tells you about it. Proceed with caution.", "NAH or ESH..\n\nYou are not an AH for not wanting him to go to his ex's father's funeral. I believe it is insensitive for him to go, but unfortunately, you dated a guy that was not over his ex, and now you are feeling the repercussions.
