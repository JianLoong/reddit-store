An ex, that I assume he hasn\u2019t had contact with in 5 years, all of a sudden needs his support? She should have plenty of enough support from her own family & friends. I could ALMOST understand him going to the funeral if he was close with her dad AND it was local, but traveling out of state & leaving you & an infant behind- no way.", "NTA for seeing \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 and being concerned. It would be one thing if he just planned to take two days and go to the funeral on his own but this plan of traveling with her and \u2018supporting\u2019 her makes me uncomfortable. I think you do \u201dget it.\u201d But if he\u2019s going to leave you and his 3 month old to go running back to her and resume his old relationship, better to know now.

But I do know if it were my husband it would be him genuinely wanting to support a friend.  However, I would set boundaries.  I think I would probably say get the information for the funeral and the baby and I will come with you.  Mini family vacation for a couple days and we can all go to the funeral.  If you aren't willing to support her with us around--your family--then you cannot go.  If new baby is too much to travel with right now, then express how much you need him and his help with the baby.  His spouse and their needs come first.", "NTA, a 3-month-old is a lot of work. Can another family member help you out while he leaves? If yes, you may want to consider trusting him as a new stage in your relationship. However, I think your feelings of suspicion aren't totally unjustified (grief can make people want comfort in an irrational way, and this is pretty far for him to go for this - my dad died a couple years ago, and one friend two hours away came, but it's not that normal to expect a 10-hr round trip for that). I would just say be aware that, whatever happens, distrust can break a relationship, and it goes both ways. Rather than making it an issue of trust (at a certain point your partner is trustworthy or he isn't and it may take a leap of faith to bridge this gap), I'd make this about how new your family is, this is an important time for the baby's development and bonding, and you personally need his support.

It was really very thoughtful.", "YTA - when my father passed my ex-BF from college, so we are talking 10+ years since we were together, drove across the state to pay respects to my father, since he was part of the family for 4ish years.

You and your baby decerve better.", "NTA this is wrong of him to even consider.", "NTA\n\nShe ain't his ex, OP.", "NTA. i say this as someone who is very happily married, and who would travel to my ex\u2019s dads funeral because when we were together, his father was so incredible to me. we haven\u2019t been able to maintain a relationship aside from facebook likes because my ex and i needed a clean break, but i know id i called his dad today, he\u2019d answer. Sometimes you get so lucky and end up with these incredible relationships that live past the romantic relationship, but there\u2019s no fucking way I would be going to that funeral to support my ex. it would be to mourn and nothing more. the fact that she\u2019s ask him for his support, and he\u2019s willing to give up at this point is big red flags, especially when you guys have little infant who I can almost guarantee doesn\u2019t sleep through the night yet", "NTA. This is inappropriate and disrespectful to you and your relationship. This would be a deal-breaker for me.", "NTA. If it was in the city fine but travelling to another state with an ex from 5 years ago. Nope.", "He has his entire life to stay home with you and his child. Going to a funeral for a couple of days is not going to harm either one of you.", "I could understand if the ex herself was dead and he needed closure. Offering himself up to provide support is crossing a line.", "For real. When my grandfather passed away, I informed my SO at the time that I didn't need him to take off work and travel because my whole entire extended family would be there as my support system. I would never have thought to invite someone I know longer had a relationship with from 5 years ago to be my support system. Crazy.", "Why are you and OP yelling.\n\nThe relationship seems iffy, the jealousy is ugly, we've been together for decades and let each other hang out with exs for no good reason for as long as we want. For a funeral? Jealousy is messed up, these responses are messed up, the whole thing is shady.\n\nYTA with a sprinkle of ESH.", "Truth. I live in Texas. \"Another state\" could mean a 10 hour drive from where I live.", "Did you do it and leave your partner home alone with a 3 month old? And an ex of 5 years, that you were not in contact with?", "but why?", "*son", "A newborn at home is major to a relationship.", "I totally disagree. There is a reason people are in your past & not everyone in your past deserves a place in your current life. Plus it seems like the reason for going is more to support the ex rather than because of the deceased - an ex that he hasn\u2019t even stayed friends with. While I understand the ex\u2019s grief, it not a justification to dig up everyone with any possible connection. If that was the way to go then every funeral would be overflowing with ex\u2019s - ex-friends, ex-spouses, ex-coworkers. Your support should come from love ones  -  people you are close to & who currently have meaning in your life. This man has a fianc\u00e9 & 3 month old baby. They should be his priority.", "He said he's going to be emotional support to woman, not to honor her father.", "A key difference is that your ex-BF came to pay respects, vs. OP's situation is a little different.  Her BF led with his reason for going is to provide  emotional support to his ex GF.    Also, a newborn at home is an emotionally fragile and tender time.  I wish he wanted to be with his baby,  and be protective of the mother of his child.    Or proud. I wish he said his primary purpose in going is  to honor and say goodbye to the deceased.  He could suggest all 3 of them go together for two days, and then he could attend the funeral while his infant and his girlfriend rest in their hotel room.", "This!! Absolutely.", "She doesn\u2019t want to go and take the child with her. If he says OK now she\u2019s stuck.", "They're different studies... the numbers don't have to average like that.", "I'm very, very sorry your life experiences have led you to believe this. I, too, have deep mistrust of my own family as a support system, and it's taken years of work to break out of that.  \n\nBut just so you know, you're simply wrong. There are family members out there who would drop everything to help care for a 3 month old out of necessity. \n\nAlso a 3 month old can be cared for by one parent. There you have no excuses on making that claim. Source: single parents exist.", "Being emotionally supportive to her while she grieves her father would be honoring her father in a lot of communities. Provided that support is genuinely platonic and just emotional support. Some people are very close with their partners families especially if they dated while still living at home, so it\u2019s not unheard of for an ex to attend the funeral of a parent or grandparent for that reason.", "I just don\u2019t understand insecurity is all. Why he in a relationship if you can\u2019t trust someone", "Why would someone make that up?\n\n[here's a story about one in eight](https://sports.yahoo.com/1-8-men-brought-condom-194042447.html)\n\nETA:  And here's a link to the 80% story, bit I think this story just got it wrong. \n[I don't know this source](https://www.outkick.com/study-shows-80-of-men-have-brought-a-condom-to-a-funeral/)", "She had no reason to not trust him until now. This whole situation is completely inappropriate, and the fact that he\u2019d even CONSIDER it is a gigantic red flag. Him asking about it and not immediately telling the ex no is reason enough to suddenly mistrust him.\n\nThe post seems to skip a lot of details. Is it a flight, stay the night at a motel ALONE, go the funeral, and immediately fly home? Or is it a road trip with his ex? Staying at his ex\u2019s house? If I were a gambler I\u2019d say it\u2019s a road trip, and he\u2019ll be sharing a room with the ex.", "Not wanting him to go is not being insecure. It\u2019s respectful to listen to your partner and mother of your child when she says it would make her uncomfortable. I\u2019m fully secure in my marriage and have zero trust issues. If my husband asked to go to his exs fathers funeral (where it seems there wasn\u2019t a significant relationship between the father and him) I would say out of respect for your current partner and our child it would make me uncomfortable if you went. That part of your life is in the past and I\u2019d like you to stay in the present. That\u2019s setting a boundary not being insecure. Not every women is insecure.", "You are correct that the second link is referencing the first link, but got the numbers incorrect.", "I also find the \u201cwhy don\u2019t you trust him?\u201d angle strange. Generally, in a relationship of any kind we trust people untold they give us a reason not to. He just did.\n\nIn another comment I said she should tell him \u201csure go. But your stuff will be moved out while you\u2019re gone.\u201d I do not understand why so many women leave their husband, take the kids, and go to their parents house. Women, DO NOT GIVE UP YOUR HOME. You kick him out and change the locks, don\u2019t leave. Unless you specifically know he\u2019s violent. If you need support, have your mom and dad come stay with YOU, not the other way around. When you move out, you lose leverage."]}
