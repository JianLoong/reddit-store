An ex, that I assume he hasn\u2019t had contact with in 5 years, all of a sudden needs his support? She should have plenty of enough support from her own family & friends. I could ALMOST understand him going to the funeral if he was close with her dad AND it was local, but traveling out of state & leaving you & an infant behind- no way.", "NTA for seeing \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 and being concerned. It would be one thing if he just planned to take two days and go to the funeral on his own but this plan of traveling with her and \u2018supporting\u2019 her makes me uncomfortable. I think you do \u201dget it.\u201d But if he\u2019s going to leave you and his 3 month old to go running back to her and resume his old relationship, better to know now.

But I do know if it were my husband it would be him genuinely wanting to support a friend.  However, I would set boundaries.  I think I would probably say get the information for the funeral and the baby and I will come with you.  Mini family vacation for a couple days and we can all go to the funeral.  If you aren't willing to support her with us around--your family--then you cannot go.  If new baby is too much to travel with right now, then express how much you need him and his help with the baby.  His spouse and their needs come first.", "NTA, a 3-month-old is a lot of work. Can another family member help you out while he leaves? If yes, you may want to consider trusting him as a new stage in your relationship. However, I think your feelings of suspicion aren't totally unjustified (grief can make people want comfort in an irrational way, and this is pretty far for him to go for this - my dad died a couple years ago, and one friend two hours away came, but it's not that normal to expect a 10-hr round trip for that). I would just say be aware that, whatever happens, distrust can break a relationship, and it goes both ways. Rather than making it an issue of trust (at a certain point your partner is trustworthy or he isn't and it may take a leap of faith to bridge this gap), I'd make this about how new your family is, this is an important time for the baby's development and bonding, and you personally need his support.

It was really very thoughtful.", "YTA - when my father passed my ex-BF from college, so we are talking 10+ years since we were together, drove across the state to pay respects to my father, since he was part of the family for 4ish years.

If you cant trust him, then were you really ready to have a child together?

And I'm sure I hurt your feelings that he wasn't completely over her but it seemed like that they did have a very meaningful past and you should be secure enough in yourself to understand that. You seem kind of immature and very petty. If you feel like you have to force somebody to not have any contact with anybody in their life before they met you then I'm telling you this relationship is going to work and it's probably because of you. I think it's disgusting to deny somebody the emotional space in order to grieve somebody that was in their life regardless of whether or not you fully understand it.

Do you think that this woman is trying to get back with him? And you think that she would try to do it at the funeral? Whatever the answer is you should still let him go because if he is willing to cheat on you or to leave you for somebody because their dad died then this person's going to do that anyway to you and you need to understand that.

I don't give a damn how nice they are/were to him back when he dated their daughter ... especially not after five years of no contact.

She have had plenty of time to find supportive persons from close to her. Way closer than states away. I don't think it's reasonable for him to go. If they were friends from the childhood, it would be a bit different, mut ex?", "NTA. It seems to me like he never really got over his ex, and that\u2019s a big problem.", "NTA, this is MUCH", "NTA! I\u2019d let him decide and do whatever he wants but I would make sure he knows if he chooses the funeral of his exes dad then he wouldn\u2019t have me or his child to come back to. That would be a huge boundary for me.", "NTA. If it's really important to him maybe suggest that you could go aswell but idk.", "NTA\n\n>she needed him to be there for her\n\nThat's a hard fuck no imo, especially from a 4 years gone ex. Don't want the suspicion? Don't be fucking suspicious.", "NTA. Maybe (BIG maybe) if he lived close and brought you but taking a trip and doing that much work for an ex (OF 5 years!) is not cool imo. I agree that sending flowers or something would be a nice gesture but he doesn\u2019t need to support her or her family in person after being out of their lives for 5 years. You\u2019re not being insensitive. I feel like he is being insensitive and disrespectful to your alls current relationship by not hearing you and your feelings.", "NTA. Why is he talking like that too his ex? At this point he should have NC\u2019ed her by now. He needs to delete and block her at this point.", "You got him on the rebound, this is all your doing.", "woah\u2026 NTA \u2026. I was expecting this to be her funeral and I was thinking ok he may want to go pay his respects especially if they were together a long time\u2026. But to go at her request to her fathers funeral is weird. \n\nHe is not her support person anymore, she\u2019s has 5 years to rebuild her life after their relationship and find herself a new support system. To travel out of state to go and offer emotional support to an ex of 5 years is\u2026. Not normal. This woman likely knows he\u2019s in a relationship with a small child at home and for her to make this demand is ridiculous and to me screams ulterior motive.", "Either you trust him or you don't.  He doesn't need your permission.  State your preference and then let him decide.\n\nNTA for not wanting it, but YWBTA if you try to prohibit it.", "NTA. They are not together and broke up a long time ago. She should not be having an emotional attachment like this with him, not to mention the optics. If you go as well, it will be different.", "NAH but regardless, neither is he. I've many friends who happened to be exes. He's with you because he wants to be. If he wanted to be with her, do you think your insecurity about this one thing would change that? If he wanted her and vice versa you couldn't stop it and it doesn't need a funeral. \nYour issue here is trust.", "NTA. you need to run.", "NTA, call his bluff and say you and your child will be going with him", "I think he should make his own decisions. I mean what if he does want to get back together with his ex? You're not going to keep him by forbidding him to get back together with his ex. Or you wouldn't be happy if you did that.", "NTA this is very offensive to you to even suggest it.", "YTA. You wanted someone to give you a baby and you\u2019re trying to control his life. \u201cHe changed\u201d.", "If he isn\u2019t inviting you it isn\u2019t appropriate.", "You need to check that!!!", "That's not the same. If you have a child with a man, that man stays in your life forever, it's not the same as calling up a random ex when there's no children shared.", "Using a child as a weapon is such a healthy relationship move.", "I don't know many years on this earth I've got left; I'm gonna get real weird with it.", "in her previous post a few weeks ago. sorry - I can\u2019t find it but I remember it. He was going to be away at least 4-5 days staying with the ex\u2019s family. It was a *long* drive to that other state.", "On the other hand, if your ex-BF has started a family recently, and you've been consistently in contact, you might be able to convince him to take a weekend off from family duties so you can reminisce about the old days. \n\n\"Tell your girlfriend you need to come to my dad's funeral, she won't know the difference.\"", "Right? I had to pick my jaw up off the floor reading that comment. I had a 3 year old rambunctious toddler and a newborn as a single parent. I was also only 22 at the time. \n\nNo, it wasn't easy but it happens. A lot.", "Is that a thing getting invited to a funeral? Here funerals are getting announced and everyone who wants can attend. When we buried my FIL we estimated how many people would like to join us for coffee and cakes after the funeral, but the caf\u00e9 that hosted the get together was ready to add tables if necessary. So it would not have mattered if someone brings their family along.", "It's a funeral, you don't need an invitation, you just need to show your respects.", "Funerals, at least in my experience, aren\u2019t invitation only events like weddings. It\u2019s perfectly normal to show up with a spouse, but maybe not an infant.", "That didn't work because the maths doesn't check out", "I think it's highly unlikely that he hasn't talked to his ex in 5 years and suddenly she wants him at the funeral.", "Well...that sort of sympathy sex is a thing.", "Irrespective.  The ex-GF didn't say \"do you and your partner want to come over before the wedding, it would be good to see you and I know how much you cared for pops\".  That was not the dialog?", "I have experience with that.", "It's not a wedding, it's a funeral. My partner has been notified about funerals before, and I will go along with him. I've also asked him to come along with me to funerals when he doesn't know the person but I do. It's quite normal to attend a funeral service without even being specifically asked, and normal to go as a couple.  \n\nOf course if the ex has plans for cosy time crying on the boyfriend's shoulder, naturally she doesn't want OP and the baby there. The ex isn't much of a friend if she doesn't respect that he has a family now. But if boyfriend is being asked to a funeral service, then of course he can take his partner."]}
