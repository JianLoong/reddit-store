I\u2019m not going to lie, when me and my man got together I can say he was a little stuck on his ex girlfriend.

I told him how I felt uncomfortable with that and he changed. \n\nAll of this was in the beginning months of our relationship and we\u2019ve been good ever since. Maybe a week ago he got a few messages from his ex girlfriend saying her father died and she needed him to be there for her because he knew the dad too, and I guess they were close (he never talked about the dad to me, not even after he passed). I told him I didn\u2019t have a problem with him supporting her and sending his condolences but going to the funeral with her and her family (IN ANOTHER STATE) is pushing it. \n\nHe says i\u2019m being insensitive because he should be able to go to the funeral and support her and her family but I think that\u2019s weird, is it not? They haven\u2019t been together for 5 years now so why is he the person you call to be a \u201csupport system\u201d for you? i just don\u2019t understand it. \n\nMaybe I am being a little insensitive but it just makes me uncomfortable, I don\u2019t know.

An ex, that I assume he hasn\u2019t had contact with in 5 years, all of a sudden needs his support? She should have plenty of enough support from her own family & friends. I could ALMOST understand him going to the funeral if he was close with her dad AND it was local, but traveling out of state & leaving you & an infant behind- no way.", "NTA for seeing \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 and being concerned. It would be one thing if he just planned to take two days and go to the funeral on his own but this plan of traveling with her and \u2018supporting\u2019 her makes me uncomfortable. I think you do \u201dget it.\u201d But if he\u2019s going to leave you and his 3 month old to go running back to her and resume his old relationship, better to know now. A beautiful wreath and a heartfelt sympathy letter to the family should be enough \u2018support\u2019.", "NTA. He\u2019s not going because he is upset the dad died he\u2019s going so he can be her shoulder to cry on. It would be a hard no for me.", "NTA. Grief can make people do weird stuff, or at least want to. I like the suggestion that all 3 of you go.\n\nI could understand if they had remained friends after the break-up and had regular communication, and you'd met her. But it doesn't sound like that's the case. \n\nI say all or none go.", "You know your husband better that we do.  But I do know if it were my husband it would be him genuinely wanting to support a friend.  However, I would set boundaries.  I think I would probably say get the information for the funeral and the baby and I will come with you.  Mini family vacation for a couple days and we can all go to the funeral.  If you aren't willing to support her with us around--your family--then you cannot go.  If new baby is too much to travel with right now, then express how much you need him and his help with the baby.  His spouse and their needs come first.", "NTA, a 3-month-old is a lot of work. Can another family member help you out while he leaves? If yes, you may want to consider trusting him as a new stage in your relationship. However, I think your feelings of suspicion aren't totally unjustified (grief can make people want comfort in an irrational way, and this is pretty far for him to go for this - my dad died a couple years ago, and one friend two hours away came, but it's not that normal to expect a 10-hr round trip for that). I would just say be aware that, whatever happens, distrust can break a relationship, and it goes both ways. Rather than making it an issue of trust (at a certain point your partner is trustworthy or he isn't and it may take a leap of faith to bridge this gap), I'd make this about how new your family is, this is an important time for the baby's development and bonding, and you personally need his support. Maybe see if his friend can visit you all later to reconnect at your place.", "NTA. He shouldn't be providing emotional support to his ex. Tell him if he leaves, he won't be coming back.", "NTA", "NTA the ex wants to mess with him and he with her. Tell him if he goes you leave with the baby. He can make a choice.", "Nta 5 years is a long time. She\u2019s an ex and clearly not a friend. I would be suspicious.", "I have attended funerals of exes parents. Even traveled 1000 miles to one", "First YTA What's the issue you do have with him going? Do you think he'll cheat? If not, what's the harm.\n\nSecond people can make real bonds with their partner's families. For instance, even if my partner and I broke up I'd for sure go to his parents funeral.\n\nMy father cheated on my mother, but when my grandfather died she went to his funeral.\n\nIt doesn't even have to be about being there for them, it's about paying respect to someone you appreciate.", "YTA if you\u2019re afraid he\u2019ll cheat, then he isn\u2019t yours. Either trust him or literally let him go. You didn\u2019t mention how long he was with her, but he may have formed a relationship with her parents. You\u2019ve been with him 4 years now. Take off his leash.", "YTA, if he had known the dad then it makes sense for him to go, you have a right to feel uncomfortable and set boundaries but this is something that he should decide to go or not to go to himself.", "YTA - someone dies and you're worried about him going to a funeral because????\n\nThe only reason would be your own jealousy or insecurity that he would reconnect with her. From your own admission he hasnt even talked about her or anything for years.", "YTA. Honoring the dead should be a given. I can't remember where I first heard this bit of life advice, maybe a song or a book, but \"Always go to the funeral\" has stuck with me for years. \n\nIf your BF knew this man, he should go to the funeral. It's such a fundamental way to respect humanity and acknowledge how short life is. And you'd stop him out of jealousy? Ugh.", "YTA. You answered your own concern: nobody *wants* to go to a funeral. Chill out. Be glad you\u2019re marrying a compassionate guy.", "YTA. You don't have the right to dictate him going to a funeral. Are they sharing a hotel, were you invited to come along? If you're really that scared of him cheating that you will try to forbid him from doing things, your relationship is already over.\nEdit to say that when my husband's dad died, his ex, who he hasn't spoken to in several years, sought him out, gave condolences, went to the wake, and sent flowers to our home. It was really very thoughtful.", "YTA - when my father passed my ex-BF from college, so we are talking 10+ years since we were together, drove across the state to pay respects to my father, since he was part of the family for 4ish years.  Your partner knew this man and was close to him and he wants to say goodbye. If you see this as an issue there are much bigger problems in your relationship.", "Let him go.  It\u2019s been a while since he\u2019s gotten any, and this grieving lady that he\u2019s still hot for should be pretty available after the internment.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s normal but you should own that it\u2019s your insecurity. Maybe present it like that and have a conversation. Tell him you feel insecure because if the recent changes in your life with a new baby, and the difficulty at the start of your relationship.

On the one hand, every person we date makes an impact on our lives.  They clearly werent just a quick fling, and was clearly important to him.  But you dont seem to trust him, and that's not great in a relationship, thats gone as far as you having a child.  You need toask yourself, why you dont trust him, is there a real reason?  Maybe this coukd be a good test for both of you, as this would be a very elaborate setup to rekindle something that was lost 5 years ago.  If you cant trust him, then were you really ready to have a child together?  I think there is too much you arent telling us, that means we cant make a fair judgement, but of course, thats going to be impossible given the sensitivity of the situation anyway, so i am not expecting you to.  Anyone who definitively says YTA or YNTA, really isnt being fair, either way.  You can either take the risk and trust him, or show him that you dont.  Either way you risk losing him, but the latter is IMHO the one more guaranteed to end tbat way, whereas not controlling him, you at least have the greater chance everything will be fine.  To find out if you can trust someone, first you have to trust them.", "Go to the town with him but \u201clet\u201d him go the the funeral without you.

But I think that maybe you should discuss ways that he can express condolences without physically attending the funeral.\n\nEven though it\u2019s been years, he still could\u2019ve had a good relationship with his ex\u2019s father in retrospect.
