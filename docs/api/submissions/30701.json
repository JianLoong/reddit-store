My DIL does not like me, my son got her pregnant in college and I told him to get a paternity test since he was not exclusive with her and she wasn\u2019t either ( he told me, she was seeing other people). He did and he is the father.  The first time I met her, she told me it was not a pleasure to met the person who thinks she is a whore. (Never called her that) I tried to explain but got cut off by my son.\n\nMe and him had a conversation and he told me to drop it. Shotgun wedding and one kid later, our relationship is strained. I see her at family events but that really is it. I have been blow off so many times for inviting them out that I don\u2019t anymore. I have accepted that I won\u2019t be a strong presence in their lives or my grandkid. \n\nNow the family rotates who does holidays. It is her time to host thanksgiving. I gave a text asking what time I should be over and if they want me to bring anything. She told me I wasn\u2019t invited but my husband is. I talked it over with him and we decided to host our own. I informed the other kids what happened and I will have dinner at my place if they want to go.\n\nWell none of the other kids are going now and I am getting texts from her and my son that I am acting like a jerk and to cancel my thanksgiving.\n\n\nMini update:  I sent a text with screenshots about not being invited to my son, according to him he didn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t invited and thought I was hosting to piss of his wife. He sent texts that confirm that. \n\nI have called DIL to ask about how he presented the paternity test and if they were exclusive at the time. No pick up so I will ask over text and give my side of the story. Will inform when she responds \n\nI got thrown under the bus and they were on a break when she got pregnant. Apparently they dated for like two months, had a break, became fuck buddies again, got back together, the she found out she was pregnant. He presented it as me forcing him to have the test.\n\nSooooo they are going to deal with that now ", "created_utc": 1699621965, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17s3qgx/aita_for_hosting_my_own_thanksgiving_after_my_dil/", "score": 6539, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Jury is out on that one and its not why we\u2019re here. \n\nBut when it comes to thanksgiving, you werent invited so what did she expect you to do?", "NTA \n\nThere are unspoken rules when hosting an event on behalf of the whole family.\n\nUnlike a regular event where you are the host and in sole \u201ccontrol\u201d, a rotating family host is actually more of a caretaker.\n\nThere is an unspoken rule that if it\u2019s your turn to \u201chost the family\u201d, that you actually HOST THE FAMILY.\n\nShe chose to not host the family, but only host part of it.  \n\nIn that context, your response is proportional and appropriate.\n\n(In less polite language - she f\u2014ed around and found out)", "NTA and it doesn't matter but I'm just curious, would you have told him to get a paternity test if they were exclusive with each other? She sounds demonic lol", "NTA she wanted people to pick side and they sided with you. You didn\u2019t start the fight and she should have foreseen the other guests, like your children, to potentially side with you. It\u2019s really in poor taste to do it on Thanksgiving when it\u2019s supposed to be about coming together, not dividing family apart.", "NTA\n\nShe wants to play this stupid game, she can\u2019t be mad when others play it better. \n\nDid you make yours at the same time (you should)? Don\u2019t let this lady bulldoze you out of your family. \n\nIt\u2019s insane to think she can invite your husband and exclude you. It\u2019s also wild that your spineless son is allowing it.", "NTA, but I have a feeling your son is. He's probably put a lot of words in your mouth that you've never said.  Every argument he is probably using you to make her mad.  I'd try and hand a conversation with both of them.  Parents can also go no contact with toxic children.", "**Info** Have you ever spent any time with your DIL alone? \n\nOff topic from your actual post question, but I\u2019m shocked by her first reaction to you. She assumed you called her a whore\u2026 have you ever told her you didn\u2019t? \n\nIt does leave me wondering what your son said about you and how he phrased his request for a paternity test.", "NTA! And more power to you and your husband. It's not your fault your DIL is insufferable.", "NTA, not one bit. This is the exact response that she should have expected with her petty asshole move.\n\nYou are not invited, so you respected that and won't go. Are you supposed to not eat that day? No, of course not. So you'll have a meal. Your husband is still invited? Oh, how nice. If I was your husband, I would politely decline, as I would want to spend the day with you. The other siblings find out mom and dad won't be there? Well, it's pretty natural to want to see your parents on a holiday - so of course they'll opt to go to the parents' house rather than the DIL who excludes family members. \n\nIf you haven't already, extend the invitation to your son, grandchild, and yes, even the DIL. If she's willing to swallow her pride, learn about family, and actually show up and be civil, maybe things will improve going forward (I don't imagine it'd ever be a good relationship, but at least civil). If not? Well, she (and your son) have no one else to blame but themselves.", "Nta.  I get the feeling your son is the actual issue.  He caused the rift and doesn't know how to fix it with his wife without her getting mad at him so he continues to let her belive you were the problem", "Hmm, I suspect your son is causing quite a bit of the trouble here.  You have only his word for it that she was seeing other people, and Im betting he told his then GF that you had insisted on the paternity test because you thought she was whoring about, so he wanted her to take the test just to prove you wrong, when its probably more like he was hoping the child wasnt his but didnt want to look like an asshole.  When you tried to talk to your new DIL about it, your son hurriedly cut you off, and then talked to you about dropping the whole subject, which suggests he was anxious about what might be revealed.\nI wouldnt try texting your DIL about the past...there is no surety that your son doesnt have access to her phone and could even reply to you as his wife.\n\nI suspect your son, to use the venacular, is \"running with the hare and the hounds\" and is quite willing to throw either/both of you under the bus with each other so long as it deflects any trouble coming his way.", "Info - why are you blaming this entirely on your DIL not you son?", "NTA but your son is the asshole here and you\u2019ve fallen for it. You\u2019re letting him use you as the scapegoat here. Why would he tell your DIL that you advised him to take a paternity test?", "NTA. You weren't invited. The rest of the family decided for themselves who they want to spend the day with. She was a complete AH if she expected your husband to come without you. Your DIL is dividing the family and unfortunately your son is complicit.", "NTA.  Your DIL & son thought they could take Thanksgiving from you. That was their intention. They thought that by excluding you, they could force you to sit alone and realize that you are an AH whom nobody loves. I love how this backfired.  Sounds like a good PettyRevenge story.\n\nThey're like a kid that thinks his toy magic wand is real. They said abracadabra, and nothing happened.", "NTA \n\nIf they wanted people to enjoy being around them, they shouldn't be AHs.\n\nThe family had made it clear they prefer you and your husband's company. You didn't force anything. You just gave an option, and the choice was loud and clear.", "NTA Honestly I would have advised my son of the same thing, given they were dating others.  She came in determined to cause upset and division.  Your son is the problem for hiding behind you , if he didn\u2019t agree he would not have insisted.  Instead he has obviously spun the tale of woe is me to her.   \n\nAs for uninviting you from thanksgiving and now giving you grief.  It\u2019s time to have a chat and let you son know his Behaviour is on the nose and if he continues going down that path, then you will completely respect his stance of independence and remove him from any inheritance as it will be coming from you.", ">The first time I met her, she told me it was not a pleasure to met the person who thinks she is a whore. (Never called her that) I tried to explain but got cut off by my son.\n\nYour son sounds so suspicious right now. He must've messed things up while trying to make excuses years ago", "So they thought everyone would be okay with them disrespecting you?", "NTA - Your son and DIL  didn't want you for thanksgiving so you are throwing your own.  What else could they expect you to do.  They sounds like a nightmare and bullies.  I bet everyone is glad that they don't have to spend thanksgiving with them.", "NTA - I'm sorry for you that your DIL is such an insufferable person. If she was not exclusive to your son when she got pregnant then suggesting a paternity test is the smartest thing to do. If she feels slighted by this then it's her own fault. You did nothing wrong and the fact that she blames you just shows that she really blames herself but can't admit it. I am really happy for you that your other kids are standing by you here. If she wants to invite your husband but not you it just shows what a pathetic human being she is. I pity your son and your grandkid having to live with someone like her.", "NTA. Why isn't your son standing up for you? Did he lie about her seeing other people? Something just isn't right here.", "NTA. You were being a parent as far as I can tell.", "NTA In cases like this, the family decided the AH. Your son and daughter in law will have to live with their judgement.", "NTA. Your DIL played a petty game and lost (and your son is not much better for going along with it). Ok, you did something that hurt her feelings and strained the relationship. And she made the decision to not forgive you. This is her choice - but then she tried to pull the rest of the family into it through Thanksgiving dinner. That\u2019s not cool, and now the family is letting her and your son know exactly what they feel about it.", "NTA. It is a social faux pas to invite a person and intentionally exclude their spouse. It's also not surprising that the rest of the kids decided they didn't want to spend Christmas w/o their parents because SHE created unnecessary drama.", "NTA- the problem is your son- because he thought it was ok to invite his dad but not you to thanksgiving. You can blame your DIL- but your son is backing her up.\nGood for you for hosting your own dinner.", "NTA BUT, you really need to talk to her.  I think your son is the AH in this situation. My gut feeling is she was exclusive to your son but your son wasn't. He told her *you* wanted the paternity test and threw you under the under the bus.  It doesn't make sense for her to have this much animosity to you otherwise.", "NTA - Did she and your son just expect you to sit at home alone? Wring your hands and wail because you had the audacity to ask for a paternity test? I think most parents that care for their sons would do the same in this circumstance. D\u0130L sounds like a real peach.", "NTA\n\nWhen you host a family thanksgiving that kind of involves inviting the family. \n\nYou can\u2019t not invite a parent and expect all their children to attend. They will typically choose their parent over their sibling unless it\u2019s a very toxic family with many people no-contact. \n\nIt makes sense that your children would prefer to be with their parents and most of their siblings as opposed to just being with their siblings.", "NTA. Your DIL made her bed and now can lie in it. She didn't invite you so what you do is now not her business. Of course you should do a DNA in a non exclusive relationship. And she knows it. Don't apologize or change a thing.", "You need to talk with your son\u2026 you\u2019re happy that they jumped into the rotation, but if you\u2019re not invited then how\u2019s it all going to work?", ">I have called DIL to ask about how he presented the paternity test \n\nI'm so glad you did this. It really seems like he told you one thing, her another, and prevented you from slipping the beans when you met.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re free to host whatever you want & people are free to go wherever they choose. What exactly they think would happen when they didn\u2019t invite you? \n\nYour son needs to step up & try to get this situation resolved.", "Sounds like your son has made his decision as to where you stand in his life. NTA", "NTA. He's the one who chose to confide in you about his relationship. Getting the paternity test was his choice. He chose to share the conversation with her. \n\nIt is their home. He is choosing to go along with not inviting you. \n\nThe other kids are adults and can choose where to go.", "I'll say NTA but also have an INFO question:\n\nWhat do your husband and other children think of that DIL and the relationship you two have? Were you the only one to express the same sentiment when she was first pregnant? Have they shared the same thoughts to you but not to your son/DIL?", "Nta and it's sad that your son was okay with this. Not a nice way to treat his mother", "Nta but I\u2019d insist on an actual family meeting between you and her with your husband to mediate so that you can clear the air.\n\nFrom how you explain it all you insisted on a paternity test because YOUR SON said she was sleeping with other people and so was he.\nYOUR SON cut you off when you first met her and tried to explain why you thought the paternity test was needed.\nYOUR SON is the one who pulled you aside and told you to drop it.\n\nTo me it sounds like they were exclusive when he got her pregnant and your son was cheating on her. Maybe he was sloppy with the cheating and that\u2019s why he said to you they were both seeing other people to cover for himself especially when the pregnancy came up. \nHe then had to take a test because of the lie he told you and that you wouldn\u2019t just take her word he\u2019s the dad since he said she was sleeping with other people, so then he\u2019s lied to her to get the test done saying that you believe she\u2019s been sleeping around and is lying about him being the dad.\n\nIt would make sense why she was so mad if she believed she\u2019d been a loyal girlfriend the whole time and without meeting her you assume she\u2019s trying to baby trap your son with another man\u2019s child. I\u2019d be pissed in that situation.\n\nSit down and explain the whole story you got from your son and why you\u2019d suggested a paternity test, have your husband there to back you up about what your son had told you and see if she even knows the whole story. I really feel like your son has lied to you and her and is trying to keep you separated so he doesn\u2019t get caught.", "NTA she should have predicted this outcome. The only option she wanted was you alone on thanksgiving.", "NTA your son is making you out to be the bad guy in this, enjoy your thanksgiving.", "NTA, but based on your edit, your son is. You could have had a better relationship with your DIL but instead he wanted to blame it all on you. If you get a response from your DIL about the truth please let us know if your son ends up in the dog house, he'd deserve it.", "NTA DIL asked people to pick sides...guess what. She lost and big time. Your kids choose to spend the day with you rather then letting her gloat you weren't there because you weren't invited. \n\nIf they were seeing other people it's perfectly ok to ask for a paternity test. She frankly needs to accept that. Hopefully karma will get her in a similar situation some day.", "Nta. Your son told you see was \"dating\" other men. It was a reasonable piece of advice. Advice which you son made the choice to listen to. From OP post, there was no arguing or fighting.\n\nWe don't know what your son said to DIL, and he may have pinned the blame (thrown OP under the bus) all on OP\n\nHaving your own Thanksgiving is and asking people to come is acceptable. As long as they are not pressured to come. Something more is going on here since the family has sided with OP and not the DIL.", "Frack them! If you're not invited to their party, you can absolutely throw your own.  Don't make it a \"Us or Them\" type of thing, that's forcing the rest  the rest of the family to choose.   Just a happy little get together because  your happiness isn't effected by someone else being petty.", "NTA, You are supposed to not have a holiday because your DIL doesn't like you? She is within her rights to not invite you, but she doesn't get to take the holiday away altogether, or to tell the rest of the family that they don't get to see you for thanksgiving, that's ridiculous. She made it so if your children want to spend the holiday with their mother they can't come.", "NTA. \n\nGlad that you have gotten a bit of closure with what happened all those years ago and that all their lying to each other is now in the open. It's not a good look to have a relationship begin based on lies so that won't help them in the least but that is the hole they've chose to dig. It seems the two of them are rather immature since DIL lied to your son about Thanksgiving.", "sounds like your son isn\u2019t doing his job trying to mediate the relationship & has used you as an excuse to get out of trouble with his wife. NTA. you simply decided to host your family\u2019s thanksgiving, assuming you\u2019d let the son and DIL come too if they cancelled theirs. it\u2019s a power move, but warranted", "NTA, but from your edits, it sounds like your son is.", "NTA. She stopped being this year's family Thanksgiving host when she invited your husband but not you. You aren't shunning anyone who doesn't choose your house for the holiday, right? Because unless you are, you are in the clear. She chose to make it a petty revenge day, you chose not to spend it by yourself. Now let the chips fall where they may.", "You said your son wasn\u2019t exclusive, but maybe she was, so your insinuation may be a sore spot for her.  I\u2019d try to apologize for the insinuation, and clear the air.  Be the bigger person and try to mend that bridge so you can get to know your grandchild.  \n\nI\u2019m not saying you are an AH for hosting your own thanksgiving, she literally excluded you, but I would still have a very candid sit down conversation with your son and DIL to get on the right track.", "INFO- is this the first thanksgiving they\u2019ve hosted? If not have you been invited before?", "NTA.  If everyone is always invited to family dinner, it isn't cool to single you put.", "!updateme", "After reading your update, i think before TG, you and hubby and son and DIL need to sit down and have an open conversation to clear the air.  Maybe then she will stop blaming you and you can give each other a real chance at a relationship.", "Wow, your son is a piece of work.", "NAH here.  Your son is a weasel and the instigator.", "NTA, but also very close to crossing the line with weighing in on your son's relationships. He's gonna fuck his situations up with or without advice, so the best thing you can do for all involved is to remove yourself from conversations about paternity and being fuckbuddies, and definitely don't get baited into those conversations because your son is seeking some vindication from you. Let him sort his house, it's his house to sort.", "Are you sure your DIL is the problem and not your son? Cause it sounds like your son threw you under the bus at the beginning of the relationship so that he wouldn\u2019t look like the **bad guy** to his gf. He\u2019s probably been doing it the whole time, playing the two of you against each other so he never has to be in the hot seat. \n\nESH", "Info: do you want to have an honest conversation with her?", "Good for you!!! Get the truth out there.  \n\nNow might be a good time to invite single friends and co workers for a lovely intimate thanksgiving and enjoy yourself.  \n\nThe kids will sort themselves out or not.  \n\nI wish you every happiness and joy.", "Update me!", "NTA - But your son has the spine of a jellyfish. Weak timber, if you will.", "NTA. Coming from a girl the same age as DIL, she\u2019s being extremely petty. Like others have said, your son probably made it seem as if you were the sole reason he needed a paternity test and not due to him having doubts as well. I\u2019m sure she wasn\u2019t happy about that. She was most likely offended that the question of him being the father or not was a question at all, although it was valid based on their circumstances. I wouldn\u2019t call and ask how he presented it to her because at this point it really doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019d sit down with both son and DIL and attempt to get clarity and give your point of view. Stress how important having a relationship with the grandkid, DIL, and son is to you, whether or not you like her. I am sorry that you are forced to be the bigger person in the situation but it seems like that\u2019s the only remedy!", "NTA, but your son might be..", "NTA\n\nwoooooow\n\nBoth her and your sons behavior...Are you sure they're adults? They definitely don't behave like one. Hopefully all of this gets worked out and they both put on their adult pants and offer you apologies.", "NTA. The fact DIL didn\u2019t tell your son that you were not invited makes me think that on T\u2019giving Day, she planned to make it seem like you snubbed the family gathering because she was hosting. I don\u2019t think she ever planned to tell the truth, that you were told not to come.", "Ohhhh your son is in hot water now!", "It seems like the real AH here is your son. \n\nOn a side note, don't give up on a relationship with your grandchild. Just going by what's in your post, it sounds like they could use more level-headed people in their life. Either way, good luck to you and your family.", "This sounds like quite an emotional family mess, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this.\n\nYour son has \u201cchosen allegiance\u201c with your DIL over you, which is marginally understandable if they share a child together, but basically your son is being an AH alongside his AH wife\u2026 Sadly, your aggressive DIL is lording this over you like a trump card instead of being gracious/kind about it.\n\nYou are more in the right than your son/DIL, but my advice is to back off a bit and let your son figure out who has his best interests in mind. He\u2019ll eventually see the truth that his wife is a manipulative B.", "I just want to say, you shouldn\u2019t feel bad about the paternity test. My mil did the same for husband, and it saved him from raising a baby that wasn\u2019t his. His life is significantly better because of it.", "Lol that\u2019s what she gets! Did she really think she could invite your whole family and not you enjoy your thanksgiving!", "DIL sounds young and IMO came in to it ready to have a poor relationship with whoever her MIL ended up being because that is what is all over the internet. From the perspective of this post you don't seem like it is your goal to be terrible to her and you were simply stating a fact when suggesting a paternity test. I get it as in some ways, I am DIL in this situation, but different \"issues\". Some of this shit my husband's parents asked him were so off the wall given our ages (30's). However, rather than being upset and blowing up my relationship with them I tried to understand their perspective. My situation, they raised their kids in a baptist household and homeschooled so rather sheltered and old school. I don't hold this over them, I never bring it up, and I know that they love me and have never made me feel unwelcome. \n\nTry to sort out the situation that caused the rift and hopefully you can all move on and have a better relationship for your son AND grandchild's sake, but both of you have to want it.

You're welcome to join ours if you want, just let us know.*\n\nNTA. You're not stealing guests or anything. Your son is probably a major Arsehole here, because I reckon he knew that asking his on-and-off partner for a peternity test could make him unpopular, he shifted the entire blame on you. Her hostility towards you is therefore *his* doing.", "NTA! Its messy, but it sounds like your son isn't being honest with her and using you as his wing man. Maybe now that the truth is out she will apologize and be civil. That's the best possible outcome IMO. Either way happy holidays and I hope you don't focus on this too hard, and enjoy the rest of the festivities. Im happy you are having your own dinner and that your husband and other children support you. & they're are doing the right thing by coming to your place, how dare she host a HOLIDAY dinner and don't invite the Mom, but you invite the Dad and all of the siblings.

I have a feeling DIL would add a lot to this story that OP is leaving out.

So good luck to all of you, sounds like your family is the kind that makes people hate the holidays.", "Especially when the son cut her off explaining why she asked for the paternity test.

(Not that this affects the asshole status for OP because they can only base their actions on what they are told and believe to be true). I think possibly the son was cheating on the DIL when she got pregnant, and made it up that they weren\u2019t exclusive. This would be why he cut off OP when she tried to explain herself. The son, as a lot of cheaters do, projected that DIL must have been sleeping with someone else too, and made his mom do the dirty work of bringing up the paternity testing, so he could always blame his mom for this, and DIL would hate his mom not him.", "Right?

So he used his mommy as an excuse and let her take the blame so he could walk away in the clear. Notice that when OP tried to talk to DIL about it the son stopped her? It wasn't just him trying to avoid a fight in the moment. It was him trying to keep the blame for the paternity test on the shoulders of OP.

He threw you under the bus over this whole thing?? Why? Why would he do that?? He's horrible to you. He messed everything up. What did DIL say? NTA You have a good husband, he's standing by you.", "So she just married into your family this year and it\u2019s already her turn to host thanksgiving? Why? From what you\u2019re saying, that you haven\u2019t even known her a year, she\u2019s never had thanksgiving with your family before and the first time it\u2019s her responsibility to host?", "If my SIL Treated my mother like shit I wouldn\u2019t attend that dinner either.", "The kids all bailing from DILs dinner and going to mom's is really indicative of where everyone stands here. It's very probable that DIL is an absolute dick at worst or just acting totally unacceptably in this situation at best.", "Exactly! Son is definitely the AH & DIL is acting like an AH. To be fair though, she was lied to (still doesn\u2019t mean she has to treat her MIL so rudely). She could\u2019ve tried adulting and spoke to her first before drawing conclusions.", "> NTA - your son is kinda an idiot , he made this mess\n> \n> \n> \n> A weak little man who made mommy out to be the bad guy , possibly ruins your relationship with his children by ruining the relationship between you and his wife\n\nThis is exactly it. Years ago he made mom the bad guy when he asked for a paternity test instead of being AN ADULT and either telling his mother, No I'm not going to ask her that, or just asked her that! Don't ask her and pawn the ask on someone else who isn't in the room.", "It\u2019s so much easier for folks to make someone else the bad guy than for both son and DIL be actual adults that communicate clearly.  Very immature behavior on their part if this is how they maintain their partnership.", "Lmao very well put.", "NTA, but it seems like you're son lied to his wife for the reason of the paternity test.\n\nEdit spelling", "It was probably more immaturity than weakness. They were still pretty young at the time.", "But a spineless son.", "That's what I was thinking, too. What a great husband! I feel so awful for the OP. Family conflicts are the worst, and she's in a doozy of one.", "I mean, did she really think that the FIL would show up solo without his wife?  This young woman sounds not very bright.", "It seems to have surprised her that you told the rest of the family what had happened.  Does she not realise that normal people communicate with each other?", "In this day and age of texting, screenshots and recording calls, that's pretty foolish. but that seems to be what's going on.", "Microwave popcorn", "From this story, it sounds like both son and DIL throw MIL under the bus when each individual makes decisions unpopular with the other. Son lied to wife, blaming his mother for \"forcing\" him to get a paternity test. DIL lied to husband about MIL not coming to Thanksgiving. Both son and DIL are sleazy, manipulative liars, dragging MIL into the middle of their marriage hellscape. Weird how none of them have figured it out on their own yet.", "It\u2019s African American Vernacular English that stands for \u201cfuck around find out\u201d (do stupid things, face the natural consequences). \n\nLike most things invented by Black people, it has become \u201ccommon slang\u201d.", "Seems like it backfired, it helps to either have power or be likeable.", "Same here. My grandparents hosted Thanksgiving and Christmas every year, and they had an open-door policy for both holidays.\nWe never knew who would show up, but it was always a crowd. Lol", "Agree w/this comment, that son's apparent lack of backbone is the issue. That said, OP, YTA for sticking your nose into your son's sex life & continuing to do so. Understand that you believe you have his best interests at heart, but it was up to him to confirm paternity - or not - & you appear unable to drop the subject (even though it was resolved \"favorably\" so to speak).\nDIL doesn't get off scott free in the A-hole department, but yeah, you did call her a wh*re. Your use of the term f-buddies reveals your continued disdain & disrespect for DIL, as does reference to a \"shotgun wedding\" (people do have choices, even in uber-conservative communities). Your son should have shut you down, & shame on him if he voluntarily shared intimate details or used those terms.\nYou need to apologize to DIL (\"was not my business\"), adjust your attitude, & attempt to be civil if/if you really want a long-term, solid relationship w/son & family. Get off your morally-superior high horse, tuck away that pointer finger, bite your tongue, & make the effort to mend bridges. Or not - but you'll find no happiness in the latter...", "I was thinking that as well... until I read, *\"I have called DIL to ask about how he presented the paternity test and if they were exclusive at the time. No pick up so I will ask over text and give my side of the story. Will inform when she responds\".*\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWTF?! If my MIL was txting me questions that were none of her business, I'd blank her too! *\"Where you exclusive when my son knocked you up?\"* Yeah, I'd be thrilled to sabotage my Thanksgiving dinner. It would be a relief!", "He's such a coward. I wonder what he is saying to his wife about Thanksgiving now that he knows she deliberately left just his mom out?\n\nSo much of this could be avoided/resolved if the lines of communication were allowed to be open. Son is gatekeeping that.", "I mean they weren't exclusive. Asking for a paternity test is pretty standard in that situation", "[removed]", "Bet he wouldn\u2019t marry her if she wasn\u2019t pregnant. It won\u2019t last.", "BINGO\n\nDIL is resentful because the MIL displayed intelligence", "Well, that doesn\u2019t matter since she wasn\u2019t even originally aware of the break? Her son told her that they were seeing each other non-exclusively, so she was going off that information.", "I have doubts that she was seeing other people. They may not even have been on a break. Son may have been the one fucking around, which is why DIL is so pissed off.\n\nSon is definitely the AH here. He is not a reliable narrator.", "Does it matter? Either way, she didn't actually do anything to deserve this treatment.", "That is so silly, it does not make sense in every relationship.", "So, according to you, it would have made sense for me to ask my wife of 10 years, to get a paternity test for our daughter. In a relationship where we've always been exclusive and both of us were each others firsts. In a relationship where our biggest argument was about a theoretical discussion of how much money we should give our future kids at an amusement park.\n\nYou clearly have never been in a long term, committed relationship. Asking for a paternity test out of nowhere would break many relationships beyond repair. Why should my wife trust me if I clearly don't trust her? This is quite literally the dumbest relationship advice I've ever seen.", "If you don't care about your relationship, sure it always makes sense. If you don't have a relationship and everything is casual, sure it always makes sense. But in a committed relationship without reasonable suspicion, does it?\n\nYou always have the right to request a paternity test. Your spouse/partner also has the right to interpret that request as an indicator that you do not trust them and think poorly of their moral character, and to subsequently use that request as grounds for breakup/divorce. And that absolutely does happen. Most people don't appreciate being accused of cheating without evidence when they're entering an extremely vulnerable period in their life (pregnancy). \n\nBut sure, you can *always* ask. Just be prepared for the consequences.", "This is a stupid take. Just because I wasn't married to my ex husband at the time.i gave birth to two kids, and wasn't married to mh current partner, doesn't mean they aren't the biological fathers of my children.", "Can this situation really get worse? OP might as well say her piece.", "Well, DIL seems to be meddling in OP and husband\u2019s relationship by excluding her.  Doing shit like that absolutely causes problems. But I do agree they should find a way to have a conversation about the issue.", "I agree. I personally wouldn\u2019t ask her,  I\u2019d ask him! How did you phrase this to the point she thinks I called her a whore? I wouldn\u2019t address her about it at all unless you say something like I don\u2019t know why you believe I called you a whore I didn\u2019t and never would. I hope we can move past this misunderstanding and build a relationship for our families sake. I wouldn\u2019t ask her about your son. That makes it like you\u2019re pinning the fault in your relationship on him.", "Remind me! 2 days", "So do you hate your son's SO?     And the advice  you got is terrible -  \"she will never know it?\"     How is that?   You are such a good actor that you will hate her for life and she'll never know it?   This sounds very unrealistic. \n\nAnd \"he will most likely always pick her side\"  sounds like a JustNoMIL who regrets the fact that a man should side with his wife and not his mother.", "OP will still be her son\u2019s mom long after him and DIL inevitably split up and he makes a new family with another, hopefully better, woman.", "Nope. OP suggesting that her son get a DNA test wasn\u2019t overstepping. She was being a good mom by suggesting that and she shouldn\u2019t apologize for that.", "Huh? This is really all on the DIL? She's the one acting crazy. She knows full well lt was reasonable to have a paternity test. She just doesn't like it", "There are lots of options other than creating a competing family Thanksgiving dinner, that would take the high road and make it obvious DIL is being an ass. Goes without saying since OP is excluded, hubs hangs with her for the day. Host friendsgiving. Invite family for breakfast or brunch not dinner. Go out for dinner with hubs. Black Friday party at 11 pm and shopping at midnight. A free day to do whatever you want at home. Football watching party. Go to a movie. Like...you can just opt out of the drama. \n\nIt's not a competition and unless their whole family loves the crazy they don't have to escalate this. It's totally reasonable to tell everyone \"I'm not invited  to dinner at SIL's house, so I won't see you there, but I really want to see you on Thanksgiving Day, what works for you?\". Sure that could END UP with her hosting instead (with DIL invited because it's a family holiday!) because the rest of the kids don't want to do 2 events, but not because she forced the issue.\n\nI mean...this is a bonkers move from DIL and the whole family knows it, unless OP left a LOT out of the story. Why should OP give her fuel for her craziness?", "Maybe that's how it went...maybe not. It's weird how the son is on board with excluding his mom. Just giving a different perspective as I strongly suspect there is another side to this story.", "That's fair. None of us know the true family dynamics. I was just pointing out there is probably more to the story and if this was done in a \"it's me or her, pick sides\" manner it's just fuel for the fire.", "He wasn't. Op said so", "That really does not make any sense because it would not make a difference in the paternity. \n\nFor paternity it only matters if the mother is being exclusive not if the father is.", "OP and GF see other people, hope the baby sees other parents.", "Yes, MIL is definitely hiding something.  Her version is suspicious\u2026. There is more to this story\u2026", "Cheaters are often paranoid about being cheated on. Or he couldn't think of a way to get around it without admitting to his mom that he lied.", "It seems to me that DIL was under the impression that they were exclusive, and if that is the case, she has every right to be angry about the paternity test, she's just mad at the wrong person.", "Totally agreed. He lied and has to live his whole life now because he's a coward that can't say \"yes, I wanted you to have a paternity test\"", "It sucks that this is so far down. It needs to be further up for visibility. A family therapist to mediate is a huge need. And if the other parties don't agree on it, then a singular therapist for OP. OP, therapy is absolutely necessary to help you get better. You can't focus on fixing others. You need to help yourself and to do so, you'll need to see a professional therapist. I can't even begin to emphasize how important this is - we all deserve emotional and mental health care for ourselves. I hope you find healing.", "And if you want to have a relationship with the grandchild, best to make peace.   \n But the next several family gatherings are likely to be awkward. \n\n If they're coming, make sure to tell the others to be nice", "When OP\u2019s son was in college it absolutely was her business if he was getting tricked into taking care of another man\u2019s baby or not.", "this is a ridiculously aggressive comment", "I agree. Don\u2019t insert yourself into their relationship. It\u2019ll implode on its own. Just be there for your son and the baby when they need you. This marriage won\u2019t end well.", "Guys a coward for sure. You don\u2019t give up your mom like that.", "Yes.  Most guys in this situation would be relieved if their mother was trying to clear the air and talk things out with their wives.\n\nI think a family therapist to mediate a conversation with the 3 of them might be helpful.  I\u2019m guessing the son isn\u2019t going to want that.", "I mean... I see a r/JUSTNOMIL and a post full of missing missing reasons, and it was the MIL who made the post. Her pov is highly unreliable imo. If the bad vibes I get from OP are true then no, the DIL does not need to be civil. Personally anyone who pushed for me to get a DNA test on my kids would never be invited into my home again. I would leave my husband over it. Of course, I'd give him the test with no argument, but *I would leave him for treating me that way.* DIL does not have to be civil at all to someone who accused her of not knowing - or lying about - who came inside of her.", "Personally I\u2019m tired of people blaming women for men\u2019s actions. Sometimes men are just assholes and it\u2019s not 100% their mother\u2019s fault.", "This is what I\u2019m thinking. The son doesn\u2019t want the mom and wife talking about it and getting along so it won\u2019t come out that he lied and they were exclusive and he was the one who wasn\u2019t being exclusive.", "Yeah he probably said that he trusted her but her mom wants and is bullying him into it so he doesn\u2019t look like an ass. The biggest AH here is him!", "\"He lied about them not being exclusive and she doesn't know about that.\"\n\nThis was my IMMEDIATE thought.", "I have. OP and her husband should have quietly gone out to dinner on their own and let DIL explain why they weren't at dinner.\n\nBut instead OP decides to enlarge the drama and drag all their other kids into it:\n\n>I informed the other kids what happened and I will have dinner at my place if they want to go.\n\nThere was no reason to do this except to humiliate DIL.\n\nMeanwhile DIL's education and future have been FUBARed by a four-month-old with a dirtbag who very likely cheated on her and who badmouthed her to his mother, who is acting like a lunatic. They are 100% of the problem.", "Sounds like the feud is coming from DiL.", "Good for you?", "Probably not 30-years-old, no. Baby boomers were born at the latest in 1964; OP could be as old as 58-years-old and she wouldn't be a baby boomer.", "You do know that men can host thanksgiving as well?", "AND she has a 4 month old to wrangle. I'm not even attempting to host because i have a 6 month old. This family is rude as hell lol.", "Some families do that, when someone joins the family it is their year to host.\n\nPersonally, I find that absolutely overwhelming.  I spent my first year with my spouse taking notes of their family traditions and mentally looking for possible compromises with my own.\n\nI think if I'd hosted a purely my-family-style Christmas for my in-laws, my mom-in-law would have cried.  She didn't think of herself as having many holiday traditions until I asked to compare notes.  Poor woman was tearing up over the idea of my family's traditional foods for Christmas dinner. It matters a lot to her.", "Perhaps DIL insisted on hosting simply so she could exclude OP.", "Seriously. DIL is burning more bridges than just the one between her and OP. That's the fastest way to piss people off. Excluding their mom like that.\n\nI also don't see a huge deal about a parent wanting a paternity test for their kid to make sure. OP didn't know her at all. My guy's mom was the same way because I hadn't met her yet. It's completely understandable that a parent would be looking out for their kid.", "I'm curious about the reaction between the DIL and the rest of OPs kids when they realised that they weren't there. I mean honestly how exactly did Dil expect this to go.", "Exactly! Excluding my mom from a holiday dinner means I\u2019m not going to your dinner either.", "If the son presented it as something along the lines of \u2018my Mom thinks you\u2019ve been jumping any guy that looks at you.  She is demanding I get a paternity test done so she knows this is her grandchild\u2019 I could certainly see how that would impact the relationship with his mother.  \n\nNot sure I believe the son\u2019s story about he didn\u2019t know his mom wasn\u2019t invited.  Pretty likely his wife flat told him your mom won\u2019t be invited to our house ever and that includes holidays.  Duh.", "Yeah, the son and his wife actually seem perfect for each other.", "INFO: How old are the son and DiL? Asking because they sound like immature brats, which they may very well be. OP said DiL got pregnant in college, so she could've been anywhere from 17-18 to 24-25 at the time. She doesn't say how old the child is now either, so this could have all been last year.\n\nNot excusing son or DiL, just curious. Feels like son threw mom under the bus for the paternity test and then kept it up to such a degree that DiL isn't giving her a chance at all.", "And mom is an AH too.", "I wonder if she thought that spending Thanksgiving with their new baby was going to be a big enough deal to make everyone spend the day without OP.", "No, she would have said they were both being petty towards her probably.", "Which gets progressively soggier with OP's tears dripping on it.", "Stupid is as stupid does.", "Yup! That\u2019s why my comment was just that it sucks that both of them suck \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nMatch made in heaven I guess!", "Lol what? This is not remotely a black person thing.", "I'm sure it's in the African American vernacular because it's in EVERYONE'S vernacular. I spent some quality time with Google and I found ZERO evidence that FAFO was invented by Black people. What is your source?", "Nope. OP doesn\u2019t owe her DIL an apology. DIL owes OP an apology for her behavior but OP has been fine.", "Took way too long to see someone calling out MIL for all the nasty things she continues to say about DIL and made no effort to apologize or repair the relationship, then pulls a power move to make sure the siblings ice out son and DIL too.", "Depends on the timeline I guess, but if they had been exclusive again for over 2 months I could see how it would be offensive, well just says I don't trust you have only been with me. I'm not certain on the timeline though haha. Anyway that wasn't his problem it was the lying and pretending it was his mums idea, it probably would have gone badly for him if he asked himself because he needed reassurance probably wouldn't have gone well for him either but he wouldn't have a bitter girlfriend trying to pull apart the family only for her to eventually find out the truth anyway. Basically if he wanted a paternity test he should have grown a pair and said it. Or possibly just have done it without her knowledge, being reassured and taking it to his grave lol", ">Not on birth control while sleeping around with multiple guys. \n\nYou can't just make something up and act like it's a fact. The son is clearly not trustworthy since he's misrepresenting the situation to both his wife and his mom", "Nowhere did it say she wasn\u2019t on birth control.\n\nDIL did not call MIL a whore, she said MIL called her a whore. \n\nESH honestly. Son lied to everyone, Mom just shrugged and never apologized to DIL for treating her like \u201ca whore\u201d and then pulled a power move to freeze DIL out from the rest of the family. DIL acted defensively with anger instead of grey rocking MIL from the start giving MIL the excuse to continue thinking poorly of her.", "Best response on this thread!", "I bet it will last, albeit toxically. The son sounds way too weak-willed to make a brave change in his life like leaving.", "yeah, son could also completely shield her from paternity test if he really wanted to. but he clearly agreed with (contextually reasonable) opinion, but pinned it squarely on mom, I bet.\n\nIMO sounds like they make a good couple :)", "You guys really make the biggest assumptions based on the smallest bits of info", "Of course it matters. THEY WERE ON A BREAK!! \ud83d\ude06", "It makes sense to Orallyyours because they $ focused!", "If you are not married it always makes sense. If you are married it does not matter as you are presumed to be the father legally anyway. Of course if you have any doubts you should do it even if married.", "A marriage is different as you are presumed to be the father no matter what. If you have any doubts then yes you should get one. If you don't then don't. If you don't believe your wife would ever cheat on you then you obviously won't want one. But I can tell you for a fact that in any case of an unmarried couple an attorney would always recommend a paternity test before signing anything.", "Anecdotal evidence isn\u2019t valid. It also isn\u2019t persuasive. There is absolutely a possibility that your relationship could have resulted in an affair. You don\u2019t have to get the test, but acting like it makes no sense is stupid.", "Well if they are 100% sure about their relationship then don't ask for one. But I know of many cases where people were 100% sure, had the baby and signed all the paperwork then later on found out the child wasn't theirs. Now they are stuck paying for and being attached to a child they know is not theirs and they have no choice in the matter. And any decent attorney would suggest the same thing I did.", "Legally, yes it does. Being unmarried they have no legal rights to the child at all unless they go to court and ask for it. They can even sign the birth certificate and they still have no rights unless they ask for them.", "> Can this situation really get worse? \n\nYes.", "A little early to make that judgement.

OP doesn\u2019t have to miss out on having a nice Thanksgiving dinner with her family just because her son knocked up a drama queen.", "I totally get that, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s the case here. Most abusive family members have the whole \u201cmissing reasons\u201d thing going on, but this seems pretty clear. It\u2019s not surprising that op and DIL don\u2019t have the best relationship. Even though op did nothing wrong by suggesting the paternity test, I can completely understand that damaging their relationship. \n\nI also don\u2019t think it was necessarily (or even likely) an us vs them thing.

I don\u2019t think family squabbles and who did what would even factor in. I wouldn\u2019t have to be forced, I\u2019d invite myself to the parents\u2019 dinner, or not go to either. Sure, after we would have to sit down, but DIL effectively chose not have a family dinner by not inviting a member of the family. If op then chooses to actually have a family dinner, then the results aren\u2019t surprising. \n\nTldr: even if dil had very good reasons for not inviting op, she then shouldn\u2019t have offered to host the family dinner.

Sure, she can throw her own party and poach guests from DIL\u2019s party, but she\u2019s not owning it. Lot of feigned innocence and surprise here that when she told her children that they are attending her party instead. If you\u2019re getting revenge, own it.

To some degree ESH due to lack of face to face communication.\n\nMy gut feeling agrees with other posters that probably OP's son has been telling different stories to his mother and his wife,  letting them deal with the fallout while he puts on a bewildered face - but he wasn't anticipating a divided Thanksgiving that brings the rest of the family into the conflict. However we could all be wildly wrong due to the limited information available. \n\nWhatever the outcome, some family therapy sessions should at a minimum lead to clarity about the timeline and full content of communications that are at the heart of this conflict, and ideally lay a foundation for a truce between OP and DIL.\n\nOf course, this does depend on OP's son agreeing to family therapy mediation, and if he has indeed been the two-faced instigator of this conflict, it could be the absolute last thing he wants because he would be revealed as TA.", "That the son seems to have thrown his own mother under the bus, rather than tell his wife the truth, tells me that those two are made for eachother.", "it just takes a particular kind of person to have a baby with their on and off college fuckbuddy in this economy to begin with, and a very very precious one to be angry about a paternity test in her situation. the nicest guess i have for her behavior is religious guilt, which might explain her being so indignant about the test... but still. yikes.", "My thoughts too, it\u2019s very telling.", "> If my SIL Treated my mother like shit\n\noh I would make hell", "Right? I feel so bad for OP!", "Exactly", "You're right.    \nI think the fact that sonny-boy presented the ask for the paternity test shows he wasn't sure he was the father anyway.
