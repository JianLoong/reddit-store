Not a right.  Maybe they'll appreciate it more when they're the ones paying for it.  Maybe they'll get jobs. \n\nIf you want them to go to college and want to support them have them bring you a report card with an acceptable gpa for 3 straight semesters.  And you can choose to help them again.", "NTA, your kid should figure it out on their own. There is no reason for you to pay when he/she doesn't take it seriously.", "NTA- I was a 4.0 student and my parents didn\u2019t co-sign any loans. Your kid doesn\u2019t deserve anymore of your help as far as I\u2019m concerned.", "College isn't for everyone. Maaaaaaybe they should be looking at other options. Apprenticeships or something. At the very least, worth looking into it.", "NTA. As you said, college is expensive and there is no reason to throw money away on a kid that isn't taking it seriously. \n\nIf you really do want to pay for college maybe tell them that you will pay AFTER a successful semester?", "NTA. You went above and beyond to give them an opportunity to get an education. Perhaps traditional college isn\u2019t their thing and they need to look at trade school, but I don\u2019t believe you should feel any further obligation to fund it. It\u2019s their dishonesty that is most galling considering they were failing and dropping classes funded on your dime. Let them figure it out and save your money for your other kids.", "NTA- why should you fund something if they aren\u2019t taking it seriously? \n\nIt\u2019s Definitely a privilege to have a parent pay for you to go to college & not taking it serious is a slap in the face to your parents", "Definitely NTAH. My dad was a Doc and could have paid for college for us but instead made us save our money from after school jobs and pay half our tuition for school if we wanted to go. This made us think about if it was the right course of action and take it seriously if we went. Your kid can go to a cheaper community college and take and pass the basics paying their own way if they want to. Then decide what to do from there. Might help them grow up a little.", "NTA. You probably should have done it sooner.", "NTA. No need to pay for college if they're just going to fail and not get credits. After 3 yrs, they should have found some sort of balance. That is a lot of money for basically nothing. College isn't for everyone. Perhaps a trade school/apprenticeship would be better.", "NTA\n\nThey seem to be struggling to handle college. It may be because they aren't taking it seriously. It may be because they simply are not ready to have that much independence. It might simply not suit their current mindset. Regardless of why it is happening, it is happening, and a great deal of money is being wasted. Continuing as-is would just be throwing away money that you do not have.\n\nPerhaps they need to get the basics from a community college and save what is left for when they have finished those classes successfully. Perhaps they need to take a year off and earn some money to help pay for their next year of classes. Perhaps they aren't ready to handle college right now but have an affinity for a trade such as plumbing or electrical or car repair or welding. \n\nGood luck to all of you", "NTA and to be clear are you talking about multiple kids in college now or one? The title said kid but the post says they and them so it sounds like multiple kids in college now", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If your kid wants you to pay, they have to take school seriously and do the work.", "Absolutely NTA.", "NTA  They need to learn the value of money and education. Community college and a job is what will wake them up.", "No more funding.   This is coming from a guy who went 4 years to a community college. I partied most of the time and routinely missed classes. Then I went into the military and finished my degrees. When someone else is paying for it, the student doesn't realize the importance studying,  just partying away from the parents.", "NTA. Tell your kid that while you respect they are on a voyage of self-discovery, you are not required to fund that and that little gravy train has left the station. Since they missed the train (actually, they jumped off the train), they will now need to demonstrate they can successfully complete the journey on their own before you can have a discussion about helping them pay off any debt they might incur.", "NTA. \nYou are spending money and they don't even study. If they want to go to college they should pay for themselves so that they would understand how is money made and how much money you spent for them doing nothing.", "NTA they played stupid games and now their winning stupid prizes. They need to learn the value of a dollar and realize college isn\u2019t just a party town.", "I paid my way thru college, by waiting tables and bartending.  I took full time classes, then worked at night, and took summer school to make sure I got thru in 4 years or less.    \nI graduated with honors.  I had already tried to go to school once and f'ed it up.  After a couple years, I realized I needed and wanted a college degree.  It made a big difference when I was the one who was gonna pay for it all - then I took it dam seriously!      \nLet your kid figure it out and maybe they'll wake up and get it together and either find a job and make something of it, or go back to school and apply themself to it.", "NTA - Stop by a recruiter and get a couple GI Bill pamphlets for them to read while they figure out how to pay for school.", "I feel I may just be putting them into the same predicament that got them here in the first place. They complained their biggest issue was balancing work, social, and school. If they have to work more hours, then social needs to take a hit. Which I doubt happening since they like to post hundreds of videos on TikTok and scroll through Instagram and Snapchat like it\u2019s a second job.", "I agree here. If they have to pay for it they will care more. They can take out student loans and pay for their schooling to ensure that they don't need to work more hours. Failing that much is obscene and I'm surprised the school hasn't kicked them out yet. So they will need to turn it around soon. You can't put more money into it and then not be able to pay for your other kids who might do better", "I was in the military, I recommended that they do the same and have the military pay for their school. I think everyone in our extended family had been so excited to have our first engineer in the family that now they think there\u2019s no other option. Both their mother and I were in the military. The military paid for our degrees and we didn\u2019t have any student loans. We wanted to help our kids by giving them something we didn\u2019t have and now I feel like we did then a disservice.", "You\u2019re probably right. That first year should have been the eye opener, but guess I just trusted my kid to do the right thing.", "I\u2019ve got one kid in now and two more graduating high school in 2 & 3 years.", "That\u2019s what I did as well. Did a semester in school after graduating and said this isn\u2019t for me and joined the military.", "How many hours do they work per week?", "There's a lot of info that's not in the OP, such is the nature of writing, can't cram the lifetime of details of multiple people into a single post. I can't tell you \"just do this, easy\" I can say, doesn't hurt to look into apprenticeships. Maybe you all decide it's not the right path, but no harm done by looking into how much it would cost, how long it would take, etc. Based on the very limited info I have, it sounds like they might not be cut out for college, but there might be heaps I don't know.", "They only work on the weekend, maybe 14 hours, it\u2019s just spending money really. We bought them a car, pay the insurance, cell phone bill, and they have a credit card attached to my account that they can use for emergency repairs.", "Then they are lying to you about it being an issue to balance work, school, and social life. \n\nYou need to take a reality check. You\u2019re paying for EVERYTHING & they are failing at school? If you keep paying for school, on top of everything else, you\u2019re enabling their poor behavior \n\nIf you continue to pay for their college, you need to make an agreement that if they are not passing classes, that you will stop paying for their things", "Looking to adopt?"]}
