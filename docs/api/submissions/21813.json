As you said, college is expensive and there is no reason to throw money away on a kid that isn't taking it seriously. \n\nIf you really do want to pay for college maybe tell them that you will pay AFTER a successful semester?", "NTA. You went above and beyond to give them an opportunity to get an education. Perhaps traditional college isn\u2019t their thing and they need to look at trade school, but I don\u2019t believe you should feel any further obligation to fund it.

My dad was a Doc and could have paid for college for us but instead made us save our money from after school jobs and pay half our tuition for school if we wanted to go. This made us think about if it was the right course of action and take it seriously if we went. Your kid can go to a cheaper community college and take and pass the basics paying their own way if they want to. Then decide what to do from there. Might help them grow up a little.", "NTA. You probably should have done it sooner.", "NTA. No need to pay for college if they're just going to fail and not get credits. After 3 yrs, they should have found some sort of balance. That is a lot of money for basically nothing. College isn't for everyone. Perhaps a trade school/apprenticeship would be better.", "NTA\n\nThey seem to be struggling to handle college. It may be because they aren't taking it seriously. It may be because they simply are not ready to have that much independence. It might simply not suit their current mindset. Regardless of why it is happening, it is happening, and a great deal of money is being wasted. Continuing as-is would just be throwing away money that you do not have.\n\nPerhaps they need to get the basics from a community college and save what is left for when they have finished those classes successfully. Perhaps they need to take a year off and earn some money to help pay for their next year of classes.

I partied most of the time and routinely missed classes. Then I went into the military and finished my degrees.

Tell your kid that while you respect they are on a voyage of self-discovery, you are not required to fund that and that little gravy train has left the station.

Which I doubt happening since they like to post hundreds of videos on TikTok and scroll through Instagram and Snapchat like it\u2019s a second job.", "I agree here. If they have to pay for it they will care more. They can take out student loans and pay for their schooling to ensure that they don't need to work more hours. Failing that much is obscene and I'm surprised the school hasn't kicked them out yet. So they will need to turn it around soon. You can't put more money into it and then not be able to pay for your other kids who might do better", "I was in the military, I recommended that they do the same and have the military pay for their school.

Maybe you all decide it's not the right path, but no harm done by looking into how much it would cost, how long it would take, etc. Based on the very limited info I have, it sounds like they might not be cut out for college, but there might be heaps I don't know.", "They only work on the weekend, maybe 14 hours, it\u2019s just spending money really.

You\u2019re paying for EVERYTHING & they are failing at school? If you keep paying for school, on top of everything else, you\u2019re enabling their poor behavior \n\nIf you continue to pay for their college, you need to make an agreement that if they are not passing classes, that you will stop paying for their things", "Looking to adopt?", "NTA.  It would have been better to establish certain rules upfront, like a gpa expectation or something.  I\u2019m against parents having full access, constantly checking in, as need to let kids grow.

It motivated him and worked great!  \n\nFree rides aren\u2019t an entitlement, it\u2019s a gift.

Total control over class schedule is not.   \n\nImo this situation the kid has blown it, and is gonna have to step up.", "NTA I think the really crazy part is that every year they just fail and they don't seem panicked about it or anything. I really can't imagine doing that every semester over and over. The worst part is they don't feel like you're entitled to know or anything anymore and don't try to come up with an excuse. Idk if it's a health issue or a partying issue or what but they do not seem ready for college right now and seem like they really need to take a step back from it \n\nThey could prove it with community college first if they were serious but they seem really entitled if they just wanna straight up keep wasting thousands of dollars for something they don't seem like they could succeed in guaranteed anytime soon \n\nIs this wildly different from what you would have expected from them from hs?\n\nI know someone who failed basically their first 1 to 2 years of college bc they had a chronic issue of not being on top of their assignments deadlines or studying since hs and never got over it when they got to college.", "NTA, this kid has not been going to class.

You've done what you can to support them and pay for college. They didn't hold up their side of things by applying themselves and trying their best.\n\n My one niece has failed 2 years of college, at 2 different state universities.  After the second fail out, she decided to take a year off. Now she's talking going back, again,  and expects her single mom to try and Finance her attempt again.  \n\n She hasn't worked but part time this whole time, no car, now no job, just moved back with mom again.

Figuring out how to balance what you want to be doing (social), with what you have to be doing (school work), and what you would rather not be doing (any extra money you might need) is a part of it, in my opinion.  If you can't figure that out, maybe you aren't meant to get a college degree.  Big money jobs are out there that don't require college degrees.  Maybe you are meant for military.

There's a lack of drive and motivation there OP. They're taking advantage of you and they're happy to do it. They must just be partying and getting down with their friends and not doing any of their work to be failing so much they can't finish a college year. College is difficult, and not for everyone. Talk to your kid and ask them what they want to do. Sometimes getting certified in something, say plummer, electrition, banker, etc is better for them.", "NTA. We have 3 kids too. My partner and I made the decision to pay for their education. There are caveats, maintain a certain GPA and work PT after their Freshman year to pay for their fun and toiletries, new clothing. Tuition, books, housing, and food is taken care by us. Two are at uni and one decided to get certified for welding and works FT. They understood that their education after they hit adult age is a privilege not a right and we want them to enter adulthood not covered in debt and we\u2019re willing to help them achieve this goal within reason.", "This \u261d\ud83c\udffb", "It is normal for students to do poorly in their 1st year.  The entire system is designed with their poor performance in that first year in mind.  It\u2019s difficult for them to stay on top of assignments because everything is very new to them.  I once had a freshman who told me he was learning how to wash his own clothes.  They are living as adults for the first time while being slammed with college-level information.  The first-year student who does stay on top of stuff is rare\u2014even among honors students. I worked with freshmen exclusively in my first years of professoring.  The struggle is real.", "Your answer to that complaint should have been \"welcome to the real world.  No one said it was easy\".     The next response should have been - \"if you can't keep your grades up, you can spend more time studying & less time socializing\". \n\nI guarantee the problem is the same issue everyone goes through when they get their first taste of freedom while going away to school.  The schoolwork is not a priority - socializing/partying/recovering from partying is the priority.", "I think that cutting them off is the right thing.  But, I pause on joining the military.  Not everyone is cut out for military service and if it turns out to be a disaster, what then?", "I had a son that something similar happened to. He just wasn't mature enough for college. He enlisted in the Navy. He is now a 1st class petty officer and has been in 10 years. So has done alright.", "I dropped out of college and went back to school when my company was reimbursing me for it. If I got a 4.0 they reimbursed me for 100% of my tuition, fees, and books. For a 3.0 they reimbursed 75%, for a 2.0 they reimbursed 50% and below that nothing. \n\nIf you decide to pay for your child's schooling again, I suggest a similar plan.", "14 hours a week and they can\u2019t do find a balance??? I know so many students working full time and getting good grades! Fuck that, they\u2019re just not taking it seriously.", "Your kid should've been S.O.L. 2 years ago.", "Obviously NTA.  Why do\npeople waste everyone's time with these clearly right  kinds of decisions.  YTA for time wasting!", "NTA they had many chances.", "Most parents that I knew paid didn't need loans.. so it's obviously putting you in an uncomfortable place knowing there may be more..

Why waste more money?", "INFO: And how did they react?", "NTA, but you should have never let them withhold their grades from you if you're paying the tab.  If I were you, I would have cut things off right then.  \"You think you're grown? Be grown then and pay your own tab.\"\n\nI know the tender-hearted Redditor will wonder if your kid has been suffering from mental illness or AHDH this whole time.  That may very well be the case.  But they are old enough to try to not sit in their own shit, knowing good and well that it's costing someone else big money.  Failing classes for two years straight is sitting in your shit.", "I worked full time in college to pay my way (along with financial aid and scholarships). I graduated with honors in exactly 4 years and still managed to meet my amazing husband and some really good friends i still have many years later. Your kid is either lying to you, is lazy, or needs this wake up call to learn how to prioritize. If you keep holding their hand they will never learn. And you\u2019ll be putting yourself in debt and screwing over your other kids in the mean time since you won\u2019t be saving for their college.", "All your children will have to learn how to balance their lives around work and free time. They likely won't learn those things if you pay for everything. But getting financial help can certainly make college easier and give you the time you need to figure things out for yourself. My parents offered me a deal that they would pay 2/3 of my expenses at the start of college and that value will slowly decrease over time. They stopped paying around 2,5 years in but that is the point at which you can start working in your field of study for more than minimum wage. Atleast that is how it is in my country. Maybe something like that is a possibility for you to offer to your children if they don't make the progress you expect but you still want to support them.", "NTA, my parents paid for my college but told me up front if I failed a class I had to pay for it. Therefore I never failed a class. Also, after my freshman year I had a full time job\u2026", "depends on the major. In my major 75% of the courses were studio courses. That meant 6 hours a week of in-class work, and a mandatory 9 hours a week of out-of-class work for 3 credit hours. That meant a 12-hour semester could easily hit 51 hours of schoolwork, not including the homework from other classes. I had one 15-credit hour semester with all studios where I had 75 hours a week of schoolwork plus 15 hours a week at a job. I can tell you my grades were absolute shit, and I was rather depressed by the end of the semester.\n\nNot to mention the professors can make a huge difference in workload too. I know I had to retake a class 3 times. The original professor gave us an essay every week, and then gave us 3 days to write a 32+ page essay for our midterm. I took the class with him twice, and just could not keep up. He was tenured which is the only reason he was not fired for his abysmal pass rate. When he retired they brought in a long-time professor from another school. She was much more reasonable. Having taken the course twice before I managed to make the best grades in class.\n\nNot saying this is what they are going through, just that a weekend job on top of school can just be too much to handle."]}
