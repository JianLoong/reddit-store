They need to build up the internal motivation to work hard at school because they finally see the purpose of school achievement: a stepping stone to a *better* job. Until they properly, deeply understand this, they're just going to stay mired in one place. The way you can help them is to take away the free money stream and let them actually experience reality (in which your money comes from the job you work) for a while, because right now they're living in an artificial reality which naturally prevents them from developing a reality-grounded motivation to appreciate school.

If they don't yet agree they have a problem and therefore wouldn't participate in therapeutic programming, then again: just stop throwing your money away for now,  your kid may have to hit rock bottom before they start appreciating the rungs of a ladder up.) If they don't agree to therapy for now, then again: just let them work and live without it. If they eventually realize that therapy could help improve their life, then step in and offer it again.
