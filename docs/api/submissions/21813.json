They stopped paying around 2,5 years in but that is the point at which you can start working in your field of study for more than minimum wage. Atleast that is how it is in my country. Maybe something like that is a possibility for you to offer to your children if they don't make the progress you expect but you still want to support them.", "NTA, my parents paid for my college but told me up front if I failed a class I had to pay for it. Therefore I never failed a class. Also, after my freshman year I had a full time job\u2026", "depends on the major. In my major 75% of the courses were studio courses. That meant 6 hours a week of in-class work, and a mandatory 9 hours a week of out-of-class work for 3 credit hours.

I think a more humane approach would be the expectation that if they continue and get good grades you\u2019ll partially pay the semester (obviously not in advance, once they show you they can). Also most schools allow you to take time off. Maybe you could discuss that with your child so they can have a break they may need.

They paid tuition room and board fully for all 4 years. All report cards went to them directly (home mailing address). Social activities - clubs were free did those, did not do sorority. Grades and social were a must - no working allowed (as the extra spending money would let me go out and party and tank my grades) consistently I hit deans list. 1st and second years on campus, Junior senior year got my own apartment- parents paid for that except for summers when my job fully covered me, they paid for my car, they paid insurance, they paid tuition.

Some kids, regardless of home life, simply can't handle the \"infinite freedom\" of college because they're too used external discipline to keep them on track.  In some ways college is harder than the real world because you don't get the immediate feedback of a boss demanding you do your job.

I'm currently in my second year of college, which is in another city, and my parents are financially helping me since the beginning. For a long time, I felt guilty about the costs I was giving to them. This feeling made me appreciate much more the opportunity that was given to me, because whether we wanted it or not, studying in another city and being financially helped is such a privilege. If things are not going well for them, I'd say that perhaps they're not giving their best at it, or they haven't found what they enjoy doing yet. People put this pressure on us to make really important decisions while we're too young and immature for that, and maybe they're feeling this weight now. I think they should understand your point of view and think again about what they wanna do. It's okay for them to quit college if it's not what they expected at all.
