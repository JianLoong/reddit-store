We do 3 separate transactions in the self check out.", "Well, that\u2019s just silly. Of course they don\u2019t. A Costco membership is like five dollars a month per member, which is not pure profit as there are administrative costs to having a membership system. Costco clearly makes a lot more than that per month per member in profit from sales. They make slightly less margin on sales than Walmart but make up for that with lack of advertising, less need for labor and other overhead, and membership fees. They also get a lot of valuable data from members as well as member loyalty, which can be leveraged into things like members being territorial about Costco, increasing its social value, and buying some higher priced goods than other stores. Forgive me if I don\u2019t care if Costco loses its five bucks on one lady\u2019s purchase.", "The bulk but not all of their profits come from membership fees \n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/stock-analysis/040915/3-reasons-costco-great-company-cost.aspx#:~:text=Costco%20makes%20some%20of%20its,prices%20to%20ensure%20customer%20loyalty.", "No, their profit comes from memberships\u2026 not sales.

I don\u2019t want to pay for others\u2019 dishonesty.", "Read the article. Specifically this part: \u201cIn 2022, Costco's revenue from membership fees alone increased 9% to $4.2 billion. The company's total gross profit for 2022 was about $27.6 billion.\u201d $4.2B is not the bulk of $27.6B.", "The reason they word it like that is they make much higher of a MARGIN on memberships because memberships themselves are almost all profit compared to profits from merchandise sales. Membership profits as a total are a small portion of overall profits.", "That is a really good point. I stand corrected.", "I think it was confusing on purpose. I personally think Costco has a strong interest in its members thinking that membership costs make up most of the profit. It makes it seem much more valuable than it is and blinds them to other manipulative tactics."]}
