A job, band practice, and boy scouts commitments on top of poor grades? Something has to go, because its clear that OP's son can't keep up with all of this. He'll have all the time in the world to make money. The same can be said for only one high school experience.", "NTA\n\nYou're teaching him to prioritize what's important.  Right now, it's that solid C average he was cultivating.", "NTA, kids need to realize that they are nothing more than a warm body to their employers and it\u2019s actually a bonus if they fail out of school, they get stuck in a minimum wage job forever, it\u2019s peak capitalism.\n\nHelp him get those assignments together and make it work, his future depends on it.", "10 days may not be very realistic. You need to call his teachers and figure out a reasonable plan to improve his grades with each subject, and enforce THAT plan. I won't say Y T A because you're just trying to parent.\n\nI would also weigh what experience/knowledge he is getting working vs. school. He doesn't sound like the type that would want or even benefit to go to college. Maybe speak to the school about a work study program where he can work half the day and go to school for just the core classes.\n\nYou need to do what is best for him and his future, if working is that, then cultivate it. Traditional schooling is not always the best way, and grades are not always a reflection of intelligence.\n\nEdit: Forgot to vote, NAH", "NTA\n\n10 days is a tight turn around if nothing is due soon.

I mean, he clearly enjoys band, how is he failing it? Band is usually the easiest A to get.", "NTA.\n\nTen days is not a lot of time to wholly change your grades around, but it is enough time to see if his behavior has changed and he's started turning in current/past assignments.", "NTA \n\n  His grades are low because he's not handing in assignments, and he's super busy. If his long-term plans are academic, it makes sense to give himself more time. A looked-after 15 year old does not 'need' disposable income.\n\n  What are his long-term plans? Perhaps he won't be attending third level and he and his mother envision him getting a leg-up on the workforce this way? Perhaps he wants to go through promotions wherever he's currently working?", "NTA\n\nHow in the world do you get an F in band. I told my child the same, show me you can be responsible and keep your grades up while holding down a job. If the grades don't stay at passing, you're not responsible enough to do both. School is more important than having a job you don't need.", "NTA\n\nYou told him what the requirements were for him having a job and he didn't follow through. But if he was already struggling to do his homework, he obviously was not going to do better once he had a job.", "A parent's job is to be the safety net when their children fall. As the kids get older, we as parents have to ease up on the safety net so each time they fall it hurts them a little more... natural consequences are wonderful teachers. \n\nI'd be inclined to make this a little painful for him... which may take time & effort on your part. Let him keep the job but ground him from everything else. Scouts can be good for teens - a place with trustworthy adults who are not parents or teachers, plus a good program to keep boys on track & out of trouble. (I have 3 Eagle Scouts myself.) If you think he can handle it, maybe have a chat with the scoutmaster & solicit their help. Maybe he misses a campout but goes to weekly meeting etc. Have them suggest that he might be able to be camp counselor over the summer, (a full summer away from home getting paid to camp!) but the interviewer will look at grades & scouting skills over his part time work. \n\nSchedule some parent/teacher/student meetings & see if the teachers have suggestions for bringing grades up. (That meeting alone makes kids squirm.) Ask them to communicate with you if he misses or gets a bad grade on assignments. Have him log in to his grades in front of you every day & if things get worse at all... one more missed assignment or bad grade, the job is gone. Enforce a \"homework at the dinner table between 6pm & 7pm\"  rule. Whatever time works for you. I did it while I was cooking dinner so I could be there to tutor, encourage etc as needed. But create the habit. \n\nAnd in the grand scheme of things an F isn't horrible. Learning how to bring an F to a C is a tool he can use throughout his life. Learning that an F doesn't mean \"quit\" it means \"work your f'n ass off\" is huge. Encourage that skill most of all. \n\nMost kids test the line. I had one who decided school was too boring - skipped most senior year 1st period classes but somehow managed to work that teacher's system & turned in all work, & showed up to tests which he'd get a's on. Teacher never once called, emailed or anything. It was AP Physics, so I wasn't horrified at the C he was pulling. We got to Jan & I got a call from the principal saying he was not going to be able to graduate because he had missed too many classes, & to prepare myself for his 5th year of high school. \nThat kid fell hard. I worked my ass off being the safety net that time & he was climbing thru his butt to be able to graduate. And...\n\nNTA - you know your kid. Do whatever needs to be done.", "NTA-  If you suck at high school, you put yourself on the worst, most disadvantaged path towards achieving anything.  So, I understand your concern.  But, I think there's opportunity for you to compromise and give him both goals like this:  10 straight days of fully completing and submitting every single one of his assignments, regardless of grade.  If he accomplishes that, then give him one month or so to improve his actual grades as well (while still completing every assignment).", "Nta for wanting your son to have possible grades. However as others mentioned 10 days is extremely tight and that would assume the teacher can drip everything to grade and put on gradebook.  Have a discussion with teachers and your son to come up with a more realistic plan.", "Nta how do you get an F in band?? Anyway. I told my kid the same thing about them working. Already in drama, grades already a struggle. If the job jeopardizes grades, its gone. They live at home and don't NEED a job yet.", "If your 15 year old child was having trouble maintaining a C average gpa while also being involved Boy Scouts and concert/marching bands, what on earth made you think he could handle a job on top of school?  His first priority should be academics.  He already had too much on his plate.  NTA, but honestly, you should\u2019ve gone with your gut and not permitted him to get a job in the first place.  He clearly can\u2019t balance his academic and extracurricular activities between Boy Scouts and his marching bands, he\u2019s completely not ready to hold a job on top of his other commitments.", "> I was not a fan of him doing this from the start because he routinely struggles to maintain passing grades through each semester and must always turn in late and missing assignments late in the term.\n\nYTA for not addressing *why* his grades are always struggling. If the kid constantly fails in school, he's old enough to understand college won't work for him. Trying to start working now and building experience so he can support himself is *smart*\n\nThe responsible thing to do would be to figure out whether or not he has some kind of learning disability or other issue preventing him from doing well or if he just doesn't like it. A 10 day deadline before forcing him to quit is less than useless. He clearly needs some kind of help", "Only because of your 10-day time limit. YTA. It would be very difficult to turn grades around in such a short time period.  I completely understand your frustration and don't think it's unfair to give him a set time to turn his grades around.  But the end of March is a much more reasonable time period.\n\n\nEdited to add a word.", "Most jobs require or request a 2 week notice. So you should allow him the time to be respectful to his employer. Perhaps if done right, they may hire him back for summer breaks. That is if he isn't in summer school taking those F grades up a notch.", "YTA. First of all, have you talked with him? Have you asked him why he's not turning in assignments? Maybe it's because he's too busy, or maybe it's something else. \n\nSecond of all, why does the job have to go but not Boy Scouts or marching and concert bands? If something has to go, give him the choice: job, Scouts, marching band, or concert band. He should be able to choose what he gives up. \n\nAlso, this is a learning opportunity. Many people struggle in life to do all the things they want to do or have to do. Talk to him about this situation so he can learn how to manage his priorities. Don't just force him to do something. That's lazy parenting.", "YTA\n\nI agree with your principle here so this is a gentle YTA.  A job can be a really valuable tool for teaching a kid to balance the many demands on time that life is going to throw at them but if his grades suffer, the job should go. (Or perhaps another activity). However, 10 days isn't enough time to improve grades significantly, particularly if academics are challenging for him. The March goal sounds like much more reasonable. Go with your wife on this one.", "I wouldn\u2019t make him quit his job. School is not for everybody. He\u2019s being a responsible human being by working and doing is Boy Scouts. Maybe find a different consequence, such as taking video games or some other recreational activity. His mom is TA for refusing to even discuss this with you.\n\nFinally, I think you should give him until the end of the term.  He sounds like my son he would often do assignments and then forget to submit them lol. My son has ADHD. Is that something you have considered?", "Never worked on me. Made me worse. I just wanted to work and it went better that way at that point of my life.", "YTA - students who work approx 15 hours per week tend to have higher grades than those who don\u2019t. Also there is a time lag between when school work happens, is marked, and is reported so the decline in grades you are seeing likely happened before the job even started.", "YTA for only giving 10 days. That isn't enough to bring up an average. If you really want to see improvement then parent your son. Ask him about his homework every day and ask to see it when completed. Schedule talks with his teachers to ask how you can help him.  Actually help him instead of using his grades like a stick.

A week and a half is more than enough time to make everything up.", "NTA- however 10 days really isnt enough time to raise these grades", "NTA because you are being involved which is great.

Now, your son is likely over extended, you said he has a lot of clubs he's involved in, plus a job, honestly I'd quit the scouts first but that's neither here nor there. I think you're NTA for getting on his ass for his grades and wanting him to pass high school. I would say to really sit down with the kid and ask him \"Why are your assignments always late?\" but not in a yell-y way. Because he was struggling before getting the job, so maybe that's not the root of the problem.

Definitely NTA for wanting him to do better though.", "A soft YTA. Putting aside the question of how one fails to turn in assignments in Band, his grades are clearly suffering and need attention.

If he wants to work with kids then boy scouts would be good to keep. If he wants to join marching band in military, keep that. If the job would serve him better for gainful employment then keep that. A job will teach him a great deal about budgeting, time keeping, responsibility and completing the work he was assigned. You will achieve more with kids if you talk to them about what they want, where they are headed and help them realise what they have to do in order to get there.

I don't think your ex is right in letting him postpone quitting, tbf - unless she's going to actively help him fix things, and I can't tell.\n\nYou two (and your ex!!!) all need to coordinate a plan to help dig him out of this hole.
