Last night we were drinking with my coworkers, and right as we were leaving, we got into an argument in the car. Out of drunken anger, I told him to pull over and I got out and started walking home. We live in a small town (only 5 miles end to end) but our apartment was 1.5 miles away through hills. \n\nIt was 11pm and it took me 50 minutes to walk home and I was very angry and hurt that he actually pulled over, even though I asked him to.  Every car that passed by, I either hoped it was him looking for me, or I was worried it was a kidnapper. I got really on edge that I would get kidnapped since it was the middle of the night and I was just a girl by herself. \n\nHe did try calling me 10 minutes into my walk (which I later found out is when he got home), but I was too angry to pick up. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes when I got home and his car was just parked there. I had to call him to let me in since I forgot my keys and when he opened the door he didn\u2019t say a word. \n\nI was fuming that he wasn\u2019t even trying to look for me or asked if I was okay. I found out that he just went home and slept and when I confronted him about abandoning me in the middle of the night to walk home, he just said \u201cwell you told me to\u201d.

You are a full grown ass 28 year old woman who TOLD the person driving you to let you out of the car. You expected to communicate the wrong information and have him find the correct answer. That\u2019s absolutely insane. If you cannot communicate your desires to your partner, you aren\u2019t mature enough to be in a relationship. You desperately want to be the victim here, but all your boyfriend did was EXACTLY what you asked him to do. I\u2019m sure if he refused to let you out of the car, you would be accusing him of abuse and trapping you in his car against your will. You are too old to be throwing drunk temper tantrums. I am 27 and cannot imagine acting this childish. Grow up. YTA.\n\nETA: Was the hope that he would be panicking looking for you? If you ever find yourself WANTING to cause the person you supposedly love to panic, you should save them the stress and trauma of being with you and just break up. You sound toxic.", "YTA\n\nIs this real? You were drunk-furious and demanded to be let out. He let you out and you walked home building an aggrievement over your apparent assumption that he wasn't looking for you out of worry?\n\nYou shit on someone, you got nothing to complain about when they shit on you. And he didn't shit on you. He respected your expressed wishes.\n\nMaybe don't get so wasted you say things you don't actually mean.

You told him to pull over. You voluntarily got out of the car. You ignored his phone call checking on you. Then you were mad because he did everything you asked him to do. What would have happened if he ignored your request to let you out of the car? \n\nStop drinking and get some therapy for your anger and probably other issues.", "YTA.\n\nYou told him to let you out. If he hadn't done so at that point, he would have Bern forcibly confining you against your stated will.

At 28 you should be past that stage. So much YTA. Grow up, please.", "INFO: You asked him to pull over to walk home....then you were hurt he did what you asked. What? He could not win either way.", "YTA. You're 28, which is way too old to be getting drunk and belligerent and definitely way too old to be playing games like this. You had so many choices other than your little \"I'm just a poor damsel out on my own\": pick up for your boyfriend, get an Uber to pick you up, have a friend come get you, etc.", "YTA. You're mad because he did exactly what you asked him to. Then, when he called (probably to check on you or offer to come get you after all that,we'll never know....)you didn't answer.

He tried calling you but you rejected the call. What else could he have done? Call another 10 times?  OP, you're 28 - you should be taking some personal responsibility for your safety.

Be so for real with yourself. \n\nThis is embarrassing behavior. I would leave you.", "YTA because had he not let you out of the car you would\u2019ve gone into a rage about how he\u2019s keeping you trapped in the car. Nobody has time for childish games at 30.

You *insisted* on being let out of the car to walk home. He *tried* calling you, but you refused to pick up because you were too mad despite the fact that that would have been a great time to admit that you were scared and needed him to come back and get you. Then you got pissed at him for NOT... what? Driving around searching for you? Trying to force you back into the car? You were drunk and pissed, how exactly do you think you would have reacted to him doing that? You put him in a no-win situation and now you're fuming that he respected your stated boundaries. Make up your fucking mind about what you want. \n\nYou're way too old to be playing these manipulative, childish games. Time to grow up before you hit 30 and are still behaving like a teenager.", "YTA. If he didn\u2019t pull over you\u2019d probably throw a fit about that too. Lose lose for him.

I understand you were angry but you made the decision to have him pull over. You made the decision to open the door and get out of the car.

What, did you expect him to chase you, a 28yo woman, through the hills in the dead of night? Did you expect him to pace the floor wondering where his adult girlfriend is and if she\u2019s safe? You\u2019re 28 years old! You made three adult choices (got drunk, got out of his car and trekked 1.5 miles to get home, and refused to answer his phone call\u2014and I\u2019m assuming refused to call back when you realized you were in over your head) and it\u2019s not his responsibility to worry about the consequences of those decisions.
