We both have sons, mine is one year older than hers (8 and 7 y). Her son has severe behavioral issues and has been diagnosed with ASD among other things. Every time the boys got together her son would go after mine. We rarely got them together as this was both stressful and upsetting. I never really said anything to my friend like \u201cthat\u2019s not ok\u201d because I assumed we were on the same page. \n\nAt her sons 7th birthday my whole family was at her home, along with a handful of other guests. We were all hanging out when suddenly my son is crying and her son is nowhere to be found. My husband took our son into the bathroom, and said that my friends son came after him again. That was the last straw for my husband. He walked past this kids room and told him \u201cit is not ok to do this to people. This is not ok\u201d and announced that it was, indeed, the birthday boy and that he was taking our son home. \n\nI was surprised but started to gather my things. As I\u2019m leaving my friend says \u201cI just don\u2019t know what to do about this situation with your husband\u201d which did not make any sense to me. She then proceeds to bombard me with texts about how I should apologize, how she\u2019s sad for me because my husband is abusive and so on. She also accused him of not understanding her sons diagnosis. My husband is a social worker and has been for two decades. He works in the field with people with all kids of disabilities. He is excellent at what he does and knows how to communicate with folks that don\u2019t receive information the same as a neuro typical person. \n\nThen come the texts about how yelling is not ok in her house, that no one is taking her sons feelings into account. She offered for me to take space. I took two and a half weeks and wasn\u2019t sure how to reach out to resolve it. She messaged me and, even though she offered space, stated that I shouldn\u2019t have been silent for so long because I know her trauma history and it was very upsetting for her. (She later admitted that my husband wasn\u2019t yelling, but his tone was firm and that was triggering for her) \n\nI take full responsibility for the fact that she did not understand that I am, in no way, ok with my son being attacked by her son. I would typically just remove myself and my son and let her handle hers.\n\nI still refuse to apologize. He son was the aggressor but she somehow turned it into me having an abusive husband. She basically sent a goodby message, and I asked her if this was the end of our friendship. She said that she would not be able to talk to my husband so it\u2019s not fair to continue to be friends. \n\nI\u2019m absolutely devastated, I had invested a lot of emotional work into this friendship, and so had she. She also has a tendency to cut people out of her life\u2026so I guess I should have been a little more guarded. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit- \nThis happened in May. She told me that she had been working with her son and that he was doing much better. I absolutely should not have taken her word for it. I regret that.

You are so right. I appreciate the re-framing ideas. I have learned from this and it won\u2019t be the the same moving forward. \n\nI don\u2019t want her back in my life. It\u2019s just swimming in my brain. And I\u2019m mad. So mad. Im having a hard time letting it go, thinking that she was ok with her kid hitting my kid. She is not a good friend. She\u2019s not safe. Im all done!", "Well, it sounds like you figured it out and took the right steps.  Solidly NTA.", "She\u2019s a complete idiot if she never realized the violence was a problem.\n\n\nWhat the hell else would it be? Why the hell else would you leave every time it happens and not bring him around til she said she fixed his violence issues??\n\nI think you need to say, \u201cmy husband is not abusive, your child is abusive. Hitting is not a game and my son cannot protect himself. Your son is a violent bully and I am astounded you keep trying to make this about my husband CALMLY setting boundaries and leaving. I do not walk to hear from you again unless it is to admit this and apologize and will only respond to a FULL APOLOGY\u201d", "> I had never explicitly stated that it is not ok for her son to hit my son.\n\nThat doesn't matter, you never need to *explicitly* state that it is not OK for her son to hit your son.  She should have been the one stepping up, and if she is going to claim the abuse card, she 100% should have stopped her son from abusing your son.    \n     \n>  \u201cif it was just my son hitting your son, we could have worked through this\u201d   \n    \nEven the suggestion of \"just my son hitting your son\" is appalling.  It is violence and abusive, and no child should ever be subjected to that.  Ever.", "No one wants to think bad things about their kids. But you're doing the right thing keeping your son away until she changes how she parents hers.", "I think all the people she's cut out of her life should be sending her thank-you cards.", "If it was just her being a bad mother...", "Sorry your friend sucks. I think she has her head jammed firmly in the sand so there\u2019s not much you can do about that. I think you could probably put the friendship back together once everyone calms down & she acknowledges her mistakes \u2026 however not sure if it will ever be the same. \n\nHas she ever asked how your son was doing after any of these incidents?", "Yes, you are, try to be the spouse and mother your family deserves.", "Except standing up for him", "You let her have lengthy tirades in silence.\n\nWhere was this argumentative vigor when this other kid beating your son?", "> *I didn\u2019t allow her to slander my husband*.\n\nGood work.  Keep in mind that if you are ever, ever friends with her and her difficult son again you are putting your husband in harm's way.  \n\nShe will say whatever she wants, and bend any situation into whatever she thinks happened in order to protect her difficult child.\n\nShe could easily make up some scenario that could cause your husband legal difficulties, OP.  At the least she could damage his reputation.\n\nNTA", "If you husband hadn't stepped in like he did, would you have even had that conversation? How many times did you kid have to be attacked before you would have spoken up on your own?", "LOL agree!", "Not once. She did ask me how it\u2019s possible that I haven\u2019t taken her and her sons feelings into account, though. In her head I am the asshole.", "I\u2019m working on it. Really.", "I did. He no longer goes to daycare with this child.", "What? I\u2019m sorry I am not understanding how I let her have lengthy tirades. \n\nI was taking him away from the situation.", "I was ready to handle it regardless of my husbands interaction.", "Yeah \u2026 she\u2019s not able to accept her own reality. So much easier to point fingers at others. That\u2019s too bad because she is definitely not helping her child in anyway. \n\nBest to let this friendship fade away. Wish you & your family all the best!", "No you didnt thats not standing up for him thats avoiding the issue because you didnt want to have to stand up for him", "There is no point arguing this i stated my stance accept it or dont not my issue", "I can tell you want to be right on this one. I agree that I should have done more. But removing him from a dangerous situation is not avoiding, it is literally taking action to keep him from harm.", "Lol, cool. I\u2019m still confused and I don\u2019t think you are understanding the situation. But I will think about what you have said. Thanks for taking the time.", "Im not the ine trying to be right but clearly you came here hoping to be applauded and are now upset you werent.\n\nYou fled from confronting this child ans the mom and let your child be beaten multiple times in silence.\n\n\nJust cause inevitably you left the day care doesnt mean you defended your kid it means when the situation got so bad you HAD to address it you immediately chose to run from it.\n\n\nThen immediately after put your son in that position again and this time your husband had to defend your son because you ignored it again", "This was not immediate. I\u2019m not looking for applause. Please chill, I am doing the best I can to correct my previous poor choices. I hear what you are saying. \n\nAlso, beaten is a stretch. I think you are picturing something more severe than what actually happened. \n\nI hear you. I was wrong. Thank you for your input."]}
