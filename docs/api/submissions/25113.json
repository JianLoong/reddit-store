I (28F) when on a vacation with my daughter (5F) and my husband (29M) as a last vacation before we\u2019re a family of 4. I\u2019m 7 months pregnant and we wanted to spend time with our daughter before her brother was born. when I was around 13, me my mom my dad and my little brother when on a Disneyland vacation. it was fun and all until my dad left his phone in the hotel and they wouldn\u2019t give us it back. he had to get a new one and my mom and dad were so upset that we never went back. I thought this was irrational since it was my moms favorite place. we went ATLEAST once a year growing up. after that whole ordeal my mom hated it. so when me and my husband wanted to go on a before baby arrives vacation, we decide to go to Disneyland for around 3 days. my daughter loves the princesses and the idea of magic so when we told her she was over-joyed. I told my mom when we were at lunch together that we were going in a trip, when I told her it was Disneyland she was in raged. I was extremely confused because I thought she forgot about it honestly. she called me a backstabber and just really rude words. she stormed out of the restaurant and I payed and left a few minutes later. a few hours later my dad called me and screamed at me that \u201cthis family doesn\u2019t go to Disney, if u weren\u2019t such a spoiled little (b word) u would understand that\u201d i was shocked. it was MY money I was spending and I thought everyone was over it, my mom texted me a long paragraph about how she would go no contact and wouldn\u2019t be my mother anymore if I still went, the trip was fully payed for so I responded \u201cokay I guess u only have a son now.\u201d And blocked her. I\u2019ve gotten atleast 60 calls from family and a few texts telling me I\u2019m wrong. we still went and got back yesterday. we all had a blast and my daughter rode her first big girl coaster. she loved every minute of it so in my opinion it was all worth it. \n\nso, AITA??\n\nEDIT 1: woah, posted this around 2 hours ago and have gotten a lot of comments. first off, thank u for all the NTA\u2019s. I was kinda scared that I was gonna get attacked. I think once I get home I\u2019m gonna unblock my mom and ask if we can meet up. we haven\u2019t spoken since all this happened. hoping we can meet up for lunch and we can talk. Also, I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of comments where people think something way bigger happened. I can\u2019t remember anything else happening tho, I\u2019m gonna ask if and when we talk tho. I\u2019ll keep u all posted. btw I\u2019m in cali and I don\u2019t get off work until 5 PM-5:30ish  so once I get off and get home I will talk to my mom. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people wanting a update so I\u2019ll try and get one to you all soon.", "created_utc": 1692551975, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wh54l/aita_for_taking_my_daughter_to_disneyland/", "score": 442, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mum and dad need to get over their bad experience (and it genuinely does sound bad!) of 15 years ago. Sure, they can choose to boycott Disney for life, if that makes them feel better, but they've got no right to impose their feelings onto you like this, especially to the extent that they're being abusive to you about it.

Your \"family\" is unhinged.", "This seems a little extreme. Yes, they had a terrible experience, and that's unfortunate, but why should you - now that you're an adult and have a family of your own - continue to boycott Disneyland for the sake of your parents?

The fact that your parents are really upset about a phone is crazy, yes they wouldn\u2019t give the phone back it\u2019s unfortunate shouldn\u2019t be a reason to hate Disneyland with a passion. This happened what like almost 20 years ago!? The OP parents shouldn\u2019t be punishing there granddaughter, there\u2019s definitely different employees there, and the trip is already payed for and I\u2019m sure the OP and the husband already took time off work. And then calling you names and saying they\u2019ll disown you is not ok. What would you have to tell the child why y\u2019all wouldn\u2019t be going to Disney oh cause years ago grandpa forgot his phone and they wouldn\u2019t give it back but he\u2019s got a new phone but they still got beef so now you can\u2019t go!?", "NTA So Disney acknowledged that they had the phone and wouldn't return it?

You and your children deserve better. Your family sound like bad influences. I\u2019m alarmed that you allow them around your children. Hopefully your mother will go NC and you won\u2019t have to worry about her any longer.", "NTA, and there's something not right about your parents' story. It sounds like either Disney never actually found the phone and your parents assumed they were \"refusing to return it\", or the phone was somehow destroyed, or there was illegal material on the phone, or they wanted to charge a shipping fee your parents didn't want to pay, or if was something else entirely like your father misbehaved and was banned from the property. Either way, their story is not truthful.

What a special memory for her.", "NTA\n\nThere is something not right about the story your parents told, though.  All that over a cell phone 15 years ago?  Makes no sense.

There's a lot more to that story than OP is telling or perhaps more than OP even knows.", "I wonder if the OP is related to DeSantis.", "it definitely was bad, caused a bunch of issues and a lot of fights. and I definitely boycotted Disney with them cause I do agree it shouldn\u2019t have happened.

I learned the hard way after my cousin\u2019s wedding that a hotel can\u2019t refuse to give you your belongings back even if they do refuse you service. She had agreed with someone at the front desk or in management to pay for their accommodations in cash so part of their space they used was unpaid for prior to the wedding. Either because of a lack of communication or the fact the hotel was switching to a new chain at the time, they were kicked out of their rooms when they returned after the wedding but all of their stuff was in the room and front desk denied them access to it. It took a couple calls to the police explaining the situation so they understood the dispute but her tune changed the minute an officer told her she couldn\u2019t withhold their belongings from them. So they were allowed to retrieve them and stayed elsewhere. So I don\u2019t understand how or why a phone wouldn\u2019t be returned. And this incident I\u2019m talking about is at least 10 yrs ago so this isn\u2019t some new ordeal and times have changed.", "Interesting.  I lost my phone at Disneyland Paris. Someone turned it in at City Hall. All I had to do to prove it was mine was turn it on. So, something is missing in the parents' story.", "we did, they put it in lost and found and it was very confusing on our end. it got to a point where  we just gave up and he got a new one. after all these comments I\u2019m starting to get scared maybe something bigger happened?? think I might unblock my mom and ask her.", "lol it\u2019s fine I definitely cried when this all first happened but I cope with humor", "yes we did, it was the paradise pier one. It was really nice actually, we stayed off property this time tho.", "thank you! she had so much fun and she has been wanting to go ever since she watched tangled,   I definitely think after all the comments I\u2019ve been getting that there is something way bigger at hand then just a \u201clost phone\u201d tho. once I get home from work I\u2019m gonna try and talk to my mom and ask if she even still wants to talk to me. I truly don\u2019t understand why my dad and mom would hold a grudge this long", "Rides are different, though. Retrieving something from tracks or near fast-moving vehicles is very dangerous. Presumably, things left at a hotel were just lying there unthreateningly.", "I worked at Disneyland around that time and there absolutely has to be more to this story.", "The only reasons I can think of would be 1) they failed to prove that it was theirs, 2) there was something on that phone that shouldn't have been (less likely on an old phone, but maybe something on the voicebox/other recorded call?), or 3) the phone was damaged and it couldn't be determined who damaged it.", "Well, in all fairness: Phones nowadays are much more advanced than back then. So it would have been harder to prove a phone was yours.", "There is *absolutely* more to this story. Please update us!", "Lost and found it. Disney will literally mail your phone back to you, so I very much think there\u2019s something bigger going on because this makes no sense from someone who worked at Lost and Found for almost a decade.", "It's possible, but I have a feeling she would deny it.", "So weird. Disney usually bends over backwards to help guests.", "Nah I worked at Disneyland lost and found 10 years ago that shit was so easy to reconnect with people. There\u2019s something missing from this story.", "It was 10 years ago. It was insanely easy to turn on. I would have asked my friend to call it once it was on. But that's just me.", "*checks OP* 15 years, apparently, but good point. (Man, I feel old XD)", "NTA. What's up with your parents.   This is a long grudge to hold over a phone", "Yeah stick with no contact thing cuz that's stupid excuse and just playing stupid just because you don't want to go to Disneyland anymore because of a phone thing at least 20 years ago I think", "NTA. Your parents sound unhinged. Sure, they may have been right to be annoyed about the phone incident - but (a) it was *fifteen years ago*, and (b) they only get to choose whether THEY go to Disney, not what anyone else does.", "You're definitely NTA, and I've never wanted an update on an AITA post more.", "NTA your money, your time, your veccation, your familiy. If somone goes craycray about this it's most likely more beneficial to avoid said person anyway.", "Do your parents having any political leanings toward a certain side of the current political landscape that is actively against anything Disney due to their support of types of marginalized groups and is currently in a lawsuit concerning their other park in Florida? Because this type of extreme reaction seems pretty normal for that political party.", "NTA but your parents reaction is strangely intense.", "NTA but I'm definitely waiting on an update for the real reason they're so pissed off at Disney.", "NTA. As most others stated; this cannot be because of a lost phone. And if it is that would be extremly weird.", "NTA. This ain't about a phone. Something serious happened and your parents need it to be Disney's fault to keep going. My guess: one of them cheated.", "NTA, the pettiness and narcissism is a dangerous combination.", "NTA, your parents sound unhinged. Just a guess, but I'll bet dollars to donuts that your dad was having a affair, and ur mom found out while you all were at Disneyland. That would explain what happened to the phone too.", "Yes. Strange overblown response.", "OP\u2019s parents need to actually tell her what the heck they\u2019re so angry about, though, if there\u2019s something else going on. It sounds like OP genuinely only knows about the phone incident, and that makes their reaction bafflingly overblown. If there was something else, they can\u2019t expect OP to psychically know about it.", "Same. Hopefully there's an update.", "I will be giving a update as soon as I talk to my mom, once I get off work I\u2019ll definitely be speaking to her. everyone saying there is a much bigger issue is definitely making me think about stuff I never thought my mom or dad would do.", "How would you make that Disney's fault?", "I wonder if they forgot they didn't tell the kids. It became common knowledge among adults and they forgot the now adult kids did not know.", "I really feel like something else happened versus actually leaving a phone behind. We had some issues with stuff missing while staying at a WDW resort and the resort bent over backwards to fix it. I mean, they truly went out of their way to make everything ok.", "Was it even a Disney hotel?  Did they refuse to return it or just not find it?  I get the feeling that your parents are blaming Disney for their own or other people's actions.  Or maybe they signed an agreement about lost property they didn't bother to read first.  But they certainly are good at holding a grudge.  Going NC with their grandchildren over a phone lost 15 years ago...  NTA.", "This is insane. Are they, eh, \"anti-woke\" people? Who think Disney is too liberal and tolerant? That's the only explanation I can think of. Can't be the phone. Sorry they are like this and I'm glad you had a great time with your daughter!", "Oh it wouldn't actually be Disney's fault, but shunting the blame to Disney is an unhealthy coping mechanism to avoid confronting the truth.", "No it wouldn't have been. Turn it on in front of hotel staff, call wife, her phone will ring. Or describe the list of contacts, they can check and verify that those people are on there without handling over the phone.", "I agree. I made a separate comment but we had an issue with stuff missing from our hotel room at a WDW resort once and they bent over backwards to fix everything. I can't imagine they refused to give back a phone.", "OMG I never thought about this. we don\u2019t talk about politics often and I never really knew what side there on. they def seem like they could be mad over how Disney is very liberal tho.", "NTA. I would never speak to my father again if he called me what your dad called you.", "NTA. Your kids, you can take them anywhere you want to for vacation now and in the future when the little one is older. Your family is way out of line and I agree that what happened back then was much bigger than just a phone someone left behind. Congrats on the new baby!", "NTA\n\nAre your parents rabid DeSantis voters or something?", "NTA and if my dad called me the b-word it would be the last time he spoke to me.", "NTA- they don\u2019t get to dictate where you go on vacation. There\u2019s something more to this though than simply a missing phone.", "If your parents are that easily willing to go no contact, I\u2019d have to wonder how much you mean to them. I\u2019d find out what really happened in the first place but if it\u2019s literally as simple as losing a phone I\u2019d be tempted to go limited contact with them.", "The only reason I can think of as to why his phone wouldn\u2019t be returned to him is because it was needed as evidence for something. That phone contained photos, recordings or something that they needed to investigate.", "NTA, I mean that\u2019s SO weird. That is such an unhinged reaction to you going to Disneyland. He lost a phone, not a child at Disney. WTF?", "NTA, the ONLY thing I can think of is this. 15 years ago, your parents committed a murder at Disneyland. It was the perfect crime UNTIL a piece of crucial evidence was left behind the cell phone. There was nothing your parents could do. They had to flee the scene. All they can do now is hope by never going back no one will put the pieces of the puzzle together. \n\nNow, though there\u2019s you. The spitting image of your mother, a ghost. No one who saw you, wouldn\u2019t remember your mother. After all these years, after the cellphone, it turned out there was one more loose end. You.", "Update Me!", "NTA!  \nThe comments are on the mark though, as soon as I read that they wouldn't give back his phone I started to question your story. It just doesn't make any sense.  \nTheir behavior is so irrational and so far over the top it's bordering on insanity. Something else is going on but I suspect you will have a hard time getting to the truth.", "So... Let's get this straight.  Your father leaves his phone at the hotel, and when he isn't able to get it back, he has a massive temper tantrum, over something that is entirely his own fault, and demands that nobody in the family can ever return to Disneyland.  Not just with him and your mother... you are never allowed to go with your husband and child.  EVER. Because he's a childish idiot.\n\nYeah.  NTA.  Maybe he should grow up a bit.  I can see being upset about losing his phone, but... it was his own fault.  There is no reason for him to punish the rest of you for his mistake and overreaction.", "Agreed.  I think the something that happened actually had the parents (and maybe even daughter-or if daughter looks just like mom\u2026\u2026) banned from Disneyland\u2026\u2026cause this lost phone story and being this up in arms about daughter and granddaughter going makes zero sense.", "yeah that part really shocked me. her not wanting to be apart of mine or my kids lives over something that happened 15 years ago is insane to me.", "I did think about this \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I was scared my dad killed somebody for a minute when going through all the reasons they would\u2019ve blown up like this", "Yeah, no way would Disney not return the phone. There's something else going on and they used that story to cover for it.", "Dropping items on rides vs accidentally leaving an item in a hotel room are completely different instances.  And from what I know about theme parks, the stuff that gets dropped is gathered up at the end of the day (if it is found) and a lot of time, people don\u2019t come back for it.\n\nIs there any chance the something that actually happened got your parents banned from Disneyland?  Do you look like your mother?  Would facial recognition confuse the 2 of you?", "Most stuff dropped on rides CAN be gotten back, but it will be the next day because they can\u2019t go get it while the ride is going. I lost a phone once, my aunt lost her purse once, hats, glasses etc. I\u2019ve never heard of someone not being able to get something back if they knew where it was lost. Meanwhile my son left an ipad on an airplane and I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re never seeing it again even though we contacted the airline an hour after getting off the plane (which wasn\u2019t going anywhere until the next day).", "Please keep us updated if you find out something else was going on! \ud83d\ude29 I\u2019m fully invested cause your parents\u2019 reaction is MIND-BOGGLING. You definitely deserve to know the truth if there is some hidden conflict that happened, especially if your parents are gonna overreact like that and basically disown you (and call you a spoiled b*tch?!?!) over this situation.", "I\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot cause it\u2019s bugging me but is it possible that the lost phone became such an issue because your parents did not want to go through the work of filling out the paperwork to get it back? \n\nSo here\u2019s the thing with the resort (accurate of my leaving in 2017) say I left my phone in my room at 9 am and checked out. I went to the park realized I lost my phone and decided it could wait till later around 12.

One night, we went to Trader Sam\u2019s, the tiki bar at the Polynesian resort. We had more than a few drinks, and I bought one of their souvenir mugs. We then took a Minnie Van - a minivan painted to look like Minnie Mouse, an on-property taxi serviced owned a run by Disney - from the Polynesian back to our hotel. I was so drunk I forgot the mug in the van when we were dropped off. When I woke up the next morning, I realized I\u2019d forgotten it, but I had all the info - the receipt for the mug, what # Minnie Van it was, what time we were dropped off - and went to the front desk to see if it was in Lost & Found. The clerk said they\u2019d look into it, and if they found it, it would be brought to the front desk where I could pick it up. This was early in the trip, we had like 4 or 5 days left, so I didn\u2019t worry about it. 2 or 3 days later, while passing through, I figured I\u2019d check back at the desk, and the clerk this time happened to be the manager. He was very apologetic, had no idea what happened to the mug, but gave us a room credit for the entire purchase price of the mug, plus an additional $10 as an apology for not finding the mug; we went back to Trader Sam\u2019s the next night, I bought a replacement mug, and toasted the manager for his kindness with the extra $10. \n\nDisney really bends over backwards as far as customer service goes,  15 years ago even more so than today, so your parents story sounds really sketchy to me. Either Disney didn\u2019t find the phone, and your parents chose not to believe them and blamed Disney for it, or, something even sketchier happened, which caused them to have a lifelong grievance against Disney which they still won\u2019t own up to. \n\n\nGo to Disney, have fun, F your crazy parents.", "Even if something insanely crazy happened, that's no excuse for what they said to you.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
