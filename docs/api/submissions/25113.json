I (28F) when on a vacation with my daughter (5F) and my husband (29M) as a last vacation before we\u2019re a family of 4. I\u2019m 7 months pregnant and we wanted to spend time with our daughter before her brother was born. when I was around 13, me my mom my dad and my little brother when on a Disneyland vacation. it was fun and all until my dad left his phone in the hotel and they wouldn\u2019t give us it back. he had to get a new one and my mom and dad were so upset that we never went back. I thought this was irrational since it was my moms favorite place. we went ATLEAST once a year growing up. after that whole ordeal my mom hated it. so when me and my husband wanted to go on a before baby arrives vacation, we decide to go to Disneyland for around 3 days. my daughter loves the princesses and the idea of magic so when we told her she was over-joyed. I told my mom when we were at lunch together that we were going in a trip, when I told her it was Disneyland she was in raged. I was extremely confused because I thought she forgot about it honestly. she called me a backstabber and just really rude words. she stormed out of the restaurant and I payed and left a few minutes later. a few hours later my dad called me and screamed at me that \u201cthis family doesn\u2019t go to Disney, if u weren\u2019t such a spoiled little (b word) u would understand that\u201d i was shocked. it was MY money I was spending and I thought everyone was over it, my mom texted me a long paragraph about how she would go no contact and wouldn\u2019t be my mother anymore if I still went, the trip was fully payed for so I responded \u201cokay I guess u only have a son now.\u201d And blocked her. I\u2019ve gotten atleast 60 calls from family and a few texts telling me I\u2019m wrong. we still went and got back yesterday. we all had a blast and my daughter rode her first big girl coaster. she loved every minute of it so in my opinion it was all worth it. \n\nso, AITA??\n\nEDIT 1: woah, posted this around 2 hours ago and have gotten a lot of comments. first off, thank u for all the NTA\u2019s. I was kinda scared that I was gonna get attacked. I think once I get home I\u2019m gonna unblock my mom and ask if we can meet up. we haven\u2019t spoken since all this happened. hoping we can meet up for lunch and we can talk. Also, I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of comments where people think something way bigger happened. I can\u2019t remember anything else happening tho, I\u2019m gonna ask if and when we talk tho. I\u2019ll keep u all posted. btw I\u2019m in cali and I don\u2019t get off work until 5 PM-5:30ish  so once I get off and get home I will talk to my mom. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people wanting a update so I\u2019ll try and get one to you all soon.", "created_utc": 1692551975, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wh54l/aita_for_taking_my_daughter_to_disneyland/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

WTF. Your dad lost his phone 15 years ago at Disney and now your folks think their going to have a generational feud with the House of Mouse? This is bonkers. Have a good time at Disney.", "NTA. Your mum and dad need to get over their bad experience (and it genuinely does sound bad!) of 15 years ago. Sure, they can choose to boycott Disney for life, if that makes them feel better, but they've got no right to impose their feelings onto you like this, especially to the extent that they're being abusive to you about it. For what it's worth, I think you did the right thing by ignoring their childish behaviour and going. I suspect they'll get over it in time, but there's no way you should ever apologise, because you've done nothing wrong.", "NTA - that's such a weird thing to hold a lifelong grudge over. Something tells me there's more to this story than you may know. Either that or you have two VERY irrational parents. Either way, it's not your concern.\n\nYour concern is having a fantastic time with your husband and daughter.", "Nta. Sweetie I think your dad's lost phone is a cover to a story you don't know about. Your parents can boycott Disney but the irrational response from your folks tells me this isn't about Disney but something much darker.", "Hell no NTA.  Your \"family\" is unhinged.", "This seems a little extreme. Yes, they had a terrible experience, and that's unfortunate, but why should you - now that you're an adult and have a family of your own - continue to boycott Disneyland for the sake of your parents? Your comment may have been harsh, but it was only in response to your mother threatening \\_to disown you\\_ if you went to Disneyland, which is even harsher. NTA", "NTA at all!! The fact that your parents are really upset about a phone is crazy, yes they wouldn\u2019t give the phone back it\u2019s unfortunate shouldn\u2019t be a reason to hate Disneyland with a passion. This happened what like almost 20 years ago!? The OP parents shouldn\u2019t be punishing there granddaughter, there\u2019s definitely different employees there, and the trip is already payed for and I\u2019m sure the OP and the husband already took time off work. And then calling you names and saying they\u2019ll disown you is not ok. What would you have to tell the child why y\u2019all wouldn\u2019t be going to Disney oh cause years ago grandpa forgot his phone and they wouldn\u2019t give it back but he\u2019s got a new phone but they still got beef so now you can\u2019t go!?", "NTA So Disney acknowledged that they had the phone and wouldn't return it? I could understand them wanting proof that it's yours but that would be a call to the phone company. Or did he lose the phone and someone stole it? Not really Disney's fault.\n\nIf they never want to go back that's fine but disowning you because of a lost phone is beyond extreme. There must be more to this.", "So why wouldn't your parents just call the police on the hotel back then? Or some sort of higher manager?\n\nIf it was that important, you'd think they'd have fought for it.", "NTA. Your parents are toxic as fuck!

Good riddance. \n\nNTA", "I need to know how to translate this to some people in my own life\u2026\n\nSeriously, mom needs some therapy for her trauma. \n\nNTA", "Info: were you even staying in a Disney hotel when the phone incident occurred?", "NTA. Your mom is really over the top with this.", "NTA your family is though what a wild reaction to you wanting your child to have a magical experience", "Don\u2019t you understand? Your dad HAD TO GET A NEW PHONE. You are out of line. Cancel the vacation you have already paid for and beg for forgiveness.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nThey have trauma with it, not you.

You don't deserve that. \n\nAlso I bet these family members do not understand how much of the media Disney actually owns, that they themselves use. \n\nYou did nothing wrong.", "NTA Honestly I think there's something else going on besides a phone, which I don't understand why Disney wouldn't give it back unless there's way more to it. About almost years ago my sister left her favorite stuffed toy at a Disney hotel and my parents didn't realize till we got home. They wouldn't ship it back but they held on to it for a whole year until my parents were able to go back to get it.", "NTA - you are free to take your family anywhere you want and it's kind of odd your parents are willing to go no contact if you take a trip with your family.   Nobody is forcing them to go.    I would be willing to bet there's more to the original story than you know.  You don't have such a life-long reaction to just losing your phone.  Dig deeper.

You and your children deserve better. Your family sound like bad influences. I\u2019m alarmed that you allow them around your children. Hopefully your mother will go NC and you won\u2019t have to worry about her any longer.", "NTA, and there's something not right about your parents' story. It sounds like either Disney never actually found the phone and your parents assumed they were \"refusing to return it\", or the phone was somehow destroyed, or there was illegal material on the phone, or they wanted to charge a shipping fee your parents didn't want to pay, or if was something else entirely like your father misbehaved and was banned from the property. Either way, their story is not truthful. Hotels don't just refuse to return personal belongings, and a lost phone is not good enough reason for a seething lifelong grudge.\n\nCongratulations on your incoming new family member, and I'm glad your daughter enjoyed the trip! What a special memory for her.", "NTA\n\nThere is something not right about the story your parents told, though.  All that over a cell phone 15 years ago?  Makes no sense.  Ther has to be more to it.", "This is not a rational response to a \"lost phone\". NTA", "NTA, your parents didn't tell you everything but they don't have any say in where you go.", "NTA.

I mean I\u2019ve heard of stories where people leave stuff and they never get it back like dropping things on rides. def gonna unblock my mom and try to talk it out and understand what really happened.", "That's what I was thinking. There's a lot more to that story than OP is telling or perhaps more than OP even knows.", "I wonder if the OP is related to DeSantis.", "it definitely was bad, caused a bunch of issues and a lot of fights. and I definitely boycotted Disney with them cause I do agree it shouldn\u2019t have happened. But there reaction was uncalled for imo. I also feel like going no contact and not wanting to be my parents anymore cause of the way I spend my money is insane.", "I agree, def gonna try and talk to my mom to ask because I\u2019ve gotten multiple comments about it and now I\u2019m over thinking. either my parents are irrational af or something really crazy happened.", "this is why I was so shocked, my mom even said in her long ass text that we should \u201ccancel the trip and forgive & forget for the family\u201d when me and my husband had taken time off work and we had canceled her preschool days for the trip. we spent like a good 2-3 months planning this and I wasn\u2019t going to disappoint my daughter cause grandma and grandpa didn\u2019t check the room before they left.", "This doesn\u2019t make sense to me. I learned the hard way after my cousin\u2019s wedding that a hotel can\u2019t refuse to give you your belongings back even if they do refuse you service. She had agreed with someone at the front desk or in management to pay for their accommodations in cash so part of their space they used was unpaid for prior to the wedding. Either because of a lack of communication or the fact the hotel was switching to a new chain at the time, they were kicked out of their rooms when they returned after the wedding but all of their stuff was in the room and front desk denied them access to it. It took a couple calls to the police explaining the situation so they understood the dispute but her tune changed the minute an officer told her she couldn\u2019t withhold their belongings from them. So they were allowed to retrieve them and stayed elsewhere. So I don\u2019t understand how or why a phone wouldn\u2019t be returned. And this incident I\u2019m talking about is at least 10 yrs ago so this isn\u2019t some new ordeal and times have changed.", "Interesting.  I lost my phone at Disneyland Paris. Someone turned it in at City Hall. All I had to do to prove it was mine was turn it on. So, something is missing in the parents' story.", "we did, they put it in lost and found and it was very confusing on our end. it got to a point where  we just gave up and he got a new one. after all these comments I\u2019m starting to get scared maybe something bigger happened?? think I might unblock my mom and ask her.", "lol it\u2019s fine I definitely cried when this all first happened but I cope with humor", "yes we did, it was the paradise pier one. It was really nice actually, we stayed off property this time tho.", "thank you! she had so much fun and she has been wanting to go ever since she watched tangled,   I definitely think after all the comments I\u2019ve been getting that there is something way bigger at hand then just a \u201clost phone\u201d tho. once I get home from work I\u2019m gonna try and talk to my mom and ask if she even still wants to talk to me. I truly don\u2019t understand why my dad and mom would hold a grudge this long", "Rides are different, though. Retrieving something from tracks or near fast-moving vehicles is very dangerous. Presumably, things left at a hotel were just lying there unthreateningly.", "I worked at Disneyland around that time and there absolutely has to be more to this story.", "The only reasons I can think of would be 1) they failed to prove that it was theirs, 2) there was something on that phone that shouldn't have been (less likely on an old phone, but maybe something on the voicebox/other recorded call?), or 3) the phone was damaged and it couldn't be determined who damaged it.", "Well, in all fairness: Phones nowadays are much more advanced than back then. So it would have been harder to prove a phone was yours.", "There is *absolutely* more to this story. Please update us!", "Lost and found it. Disney will literally mail your phone back to you, so I very much think there\u2019s something bigger going on because this makes no sense from someone who worked at Lost and Found for almost a decade.", "It's possible, but I have a feeling she would deny it.", "So weird. Disney usually bends over backwards to help guests.", "Nah I worked at Disneyland lost and found 10 years ago that shit was so easy to reconnect with people. There\u2019s something missing from this story.", "It was 10 years ago. It was insanely easy to turn on. I would have asked my friend to call it once it was on. But that's just me.", "*checks OP* 15 years, apparently, but good point. (Man, I feel old XD)", "NTA. What's up with your parents.   This is a long grudge to hold over a phone", "Yeah stick with no contact thing cuz that's stupid excuse and just playing stupid just because you don't want to go to Disneyland anymore because of a phone thing at least 20 years ago I think", "NTA. Your parents sound unhinged. Sure, they may have been right to be annoyed about the phone incident - but (a) it was *fifteen years ago*, and (b) they only get to choose whether THEY go to Disney, not what anyone else does.", "You're definitely NTA, and I've never wanted an update on an AITA post more.", "NTA your money, your time, your veccation, your familiy. If somone goes craycray about this it's most likely more beneficial to avoid said person anyway.", "Do your parents having any political leanings toward a certain side of the current political landscape that is actively against anything Disney due to their support of types of marginalized groups and is currently in a lawsuit concerning their other park in Florida? Because this type of extreme reaction seems pretty normal for that political party.", "NTA but your parents reaction is strangely intense.", "NTA but I'm definitely waiting on an update for the real reason they're so pissed off at Disney.", "NTA. As most others stated; this cannot be because of a lost phone. And if it is that would be extremly weird.", "NTA. This ain't about a phone. Something serious happened and your parents need it to be Disney's fault to keep going. My guess: one of them cheated.", "NTA, the pettiness and narcissism is a dangerous combination.", "NTA, your parents sound unhinged. Just a guess, but I'll bet dollars to donuts that your dad was having a affair, and ur mom found out while you all were at Disneyland. That would explain what happened to the phone too.", "Yes. Strange overblown response.", "OP\u2019s parents need to actually tell her what the heck they\u2019re so angry about, though, if there\u2019s something else going on. It sounds like OP genuinely only knows about the phone incident, and that makes their reaction bafflingly overblown. If there was something else, they can\u2019t expect OP to psychically know about it.", "Same. Hopefully there's an update.", "I will be giving a update as soon as I talk to my mom, once I get off work I\u2019ll definitely be speaking to her. everyone saying there is a much bigger issue is definitely making me think about stuff I never thought my mom or dad would do.", "How would you make that Disney's fault?", "I wonder if they forgot they didn't tell the kids. It became common knowledge among adults and they forgot the now adult kids did not know.", "I really feel like something else happened versus actually leaving a phone behind. We had some issues with stuff missing while staying at a WDW resort and the resort bent over backwards to fix it. I mean, they truly went out of their way to make everything ok.", "Was it even a Disney hotel?  Did they refuse to return it or just not find it?  I get the feeling that your parents are blaming Disney for their own or other people's actions.  Or maybe they signed an agreement about lost property they didn't bother to read first.  But they certainly are good at holding a grudge.  Going NC with their grandchildren over a phone lost 15 years ago...  NTA.", "This is insane. Are they, eh, \"anti-woke\" people? Who think Disney is too liberal and tolerant? That's the only explanation I can think of. Can't be the phone. Sorry they are like this and I'm glad you had a great time with your daughter!", "Oh it wouldn't actually be Disney's fault, but shunting the blame to Disney is an unhealthy coping mechanism to avoid confronting the truth.", "No it wouldn't have been. Turn it on in front of hotel staff, call wife, her phone will ring. Or describe the list of contacts, they can check and verify that those people are on there without handling over the phone.", "I agree. I made a separate comment but we had an issue with stuff missing from our hotel room at a WDW resort once and they bent over backwards to fix everything. I can't imagine they refused to give back a phone.", "OMG I never thought about this. we don\u2019t talk about politics often and I never really knew what side there on. they def seem like they could be mad over how Disney is very liberal tho."]}
