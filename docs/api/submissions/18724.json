I (27F) have always had a rocky relationship with my younger sister (24F). We've had our fair share of disagreements and clashes over the years. Recently, my sister landed a job interview at a prestigious company that could potentially be a game-changer for her career.\n\nThe issue arose when she realized she didn't have a car of her own to get to the interview location. She came to me, asking if she could borrow my car for the day. Now, normally, lending a car to someone in need would be a no-brainer, but here's why I said no.\n\nFirstly, my sister has a history of being careless and irresponsible with other people's belongings. Numerous incidents have occurred in the past where she's damaged or lost things that were entrusted to her care. I simply couldn't risk having my car damaged or involved in an accident due to her negligence.\n\nSecondly, my sister has a habit of not returning borrowed items in a timely manner. There have been instances where she conveniently \"forgets\" to return things for weeks or even months, causing frustration and tension between us. Given her track record, I couldn't trust that my car would be returned promptly, which could inconvenience me if I needed it.\n\nLastly, I believe in personal responsibility and accountability. My sister has relied on others to bail her out of situations throughout her life. By refusing to lend her my car, I wanted to encourage her to find alternative solutions and take responsibility for her own transportation needs.\n\nNow, my sister and some family members are upset with me, calling me selfish and unsupportive. They believe that I should have put our differences aside and helped her out in a time of need. But I can't help but think about the potential risks and inconveniences I would face if something went wrong.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for refusing to lend my car to my sister for her job interview?", "created_utc": 1685636527, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xlz0o/aita_for_refusing_to_lend_my_car_to_my_sister_for/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You said no so that should be end of story.  As for the rest of family putting in their 2 cents worth - it is non of their business so they should not even comment.  If your sister requires a car to attend an interview then she most likely requires a car to attend the job.  Time she grows up and takes responsibility rather that expect others to bail her out.", "NTA.  tell here the fact that you have treated my things with disrespect multiple times before means you are no longer allowed to use them.", "NTA. Lending a car is almost always a hard no from me, just because so much can go wrong. Sis is just going to have to figure it out for herself.  And how come none of the people calling you un-supportive will loan her their vehicle?", "If she\u2019s not on the car insurance, then isn\u2019t it illegal to lend her your car?", "Info: Do you both live with your parents or just her? Also has she ever been in a car accident?\n\nBut from your comments:  \n\\-You can't drive for the time being  \n\\-She can't take a taxi/Uber or public transit  \n\\-Nobody else around can take her \n\nI'm just kinda confused here, your reasoning doesn't sit right with me at all. How is denying her an opportunity to get a good job going to teach her a lesson? How would she forget to return a whole car to you? How would that inconvenience you if you can't drive it anyway?\n\nBased on how you started the post it kinda just sounds like you're trying to get back at her for whatever and your third reason just sounds punitive for no reason.

She has options and you are allowed to say no.", "If her sister is irresponsible with borrowed things, what if she damaged it while using it?", "If the sister isn\u2019t insured to drive the car, lending it to her would be a ridiculous move for OP. She\u2019s not asking to borrow some clothes. It\u2019s a CAR. Worth thousands of dollars. Which OP will have no recourse in recovering if the sister wrecks it.", "I agree. Obviously the situation sucks but this could be the chance for the sister to take on more responsibility through this new job, and I\u2019m getting the impression that most of the problems mentioned happened when they were younger. OP said in another comment that there\u2019s not Uber/taxi or public transportation where they live anyways. Don\u2019t get why everyone is shitting on the sister so much", "Where I live it doesn't matter because the car is insured not the driver, unless they are a learner. So it's not illegal and the cops don't check insurance, just registration and driving license.", "What\u2019s the sisters plan for getting to work on a daily basis then?", "OP says there\u2019s no public transportation nor Uber/taxi where she lives. Basically, OP has her sister by the throat right where she wants her. I\u2019m starting to suspect OP is justifying her meanness/sabotage using reasons from years ago when the sister was still an immature teenager. Hard to imagine a prestigious firm short-listing a scatter-brain the way OP made out her sister to be. Either the sister had matured and grown to become a better person, or her professional mask is damn well put together.", "Still not your problem OP. NTA. Also, I would presume the interview would be at the location she would then have to commute to for the actual job, unless she'd be working remotely or at a closer location.\n\nEdit: I see the comments about there being no transit or taxi.", "Then how does she plan to get to this job every day if she gets it?", "So what were her other options?", "Looks like she'll have to hire a car for the day then.\n\nNTA.", "How do you expect her to \u2018take responsibility\u2019 then?

I mean, your last reason also sounds like high and mighty BS to me, but that's me. You are not required to lend her your car, and as people really need to remember, no is a complete sentence, but your family and the good people of Reddit are allowed to think you're an AH for not doing. Here's an alternative view of the situation. You currently can't use your car, she needs a car to get to a very important interview, and instead of assisting, but with caveats because of her previous issues, you decided to say flat out no. You can, you're entitled to do so, but YTA at least a little for it.", "I get where you come from. Buy your car sit in the driveway/garage, and you don't need it, and you can't driveway it anyway .\n\nWhy don't you lay some strict rules regarding the use of the car?", "And that goes straight back to what is she going to do if she gets the job. She still won't have a car. So, no, this is not OP's to fix. Especially when she's careless and bad about returning things. NTA\n\nPlus, I guarantee she'll be using the car for more than her interview bc she hasn't had access to one in a bit.  That's even more risk OP shouldn't have to take on.", "True but if sister has already proven untrustworthy on multiple occasions\u2026I wouldn\u2019t lend someone my car either in that case. ESP if you need the car daily to commute!\n\nAnd sister can just rent a car for the day, she does have options here.", "When you guys were younger, you say. Has she changed? Surely she has some redeeming factors if a prestigious firm decides to choose her. Hopefully you are not judging her teenage self against her adult self, people do mature and grow up.", "So if there's no public transportation available in their area what is sis planning to do if she gets the job? I can see this becoming an ongoing headache.", "I say, still don\u2019t give it to her. If she has a history of being unreliable, don\u2019t hand her one of the most important possessions in your life. Her parents can lend her their car.", "She would need to secure a job first before she can buy a car, no? Otherwise how is she going to get the money for a car?", "now this is a good question.", "You're neglecting the part where the sister isnt careful with other people's things", "If her sister has an accident in her car and is not an insured driver, OP won\u2019t be covered. Loaning someone your car, especially someone who has proven to be irresponsible, is a huge ask. Laying down \u201cstrict rules\u201d isn\u2019t going to do much if sister wrecks the car.", "I disagree. I would help out my sister for her job interview regardless. But to each their own I suppose.", "true but idk I feel like she could\u2019ve helped for one day at least. Maybe I\u2019m biased because I have a messy sister too", "I'm not actually. I said 'with caveats because of her previous issues' so get her agreement that she pays for any damages and have a confirmed date when it is returned and it would form a contract. OP has already admitted in other comments that there is no public transport or Uber in the area, so they are legitimately tanking her ability to go for this job for what are actually pretty petty reasons."]}
