Recently, my sister landed a job interview at a prestigious company that could potentially be a game-changer for her career.\n\nThe issue arose when she realized she didn't have a car of her own to get to the interview location. She came to me, asking if she could borrow my car for the day. Now, normally, lending a car to someone in need would be a no-brainer, but here's why I said no.\n\nFirstly, my sister has a history of being careless and irresponsible with other people's belongings. Numerous incidents have occurred in the past where she's damaged or lost things that were entrusted to her care. I simply couldn't risk having my car damaged or involved in an accident due to her negligence.\n\nSecondly, my sister has a habit of not returning borrowed items in a timely manner. There have been instances where she conveniently \"forgets\" to return things for weeks or even months, causing frustration and tension between us. Given her track record, I couldn't trust that my car would be returned promptly, which could inconvenience me if I needed it.\n\nLastly, I believe in personal responsibility and accountability. My sister has relied on others to bail her out of situations throughout her life. By refusing to lend her my car, I wanted to encourage her to find alternative solutions and take responsibility for her own transportation needs.\n\nNow, my sister and some family members are upset with me, calling me selfish and unsupportive. They believe that I should have put our differences aside and helped her out in a time of need.

How would she get to work if she got the job?", "NTA. She\u2019s an \u201cadult\u201d and can figure it out herself", "NTA. Send her the links to UBER and Enterprise.", "Possible solution: hold a deposit. Could be cash, a very fancy item, her credit card... whatever you want.\n\nIf she so desperately wants to borrow your car, and you have concerns about it ever returning to you, at least you have a consolation prize if your nightmares come true.", "NTA. If you can't afford to lose the item, you shouldn't loan it. \n\nFor example, we loaned a car to a friend who had to take his wife to a prenatal appointment. No history of not returning items. They got into an accident and promised us they'd make it right. Several years later we had guilted enough money for the major parts (not all) out of them and my husband was able to do the work himself. Lesson learned.", "NTA. Where do all these people live where just handing out their cars to everyone who asks is normal. I\u2019m not giving my car to anyone. And I mean anyone. If my brother needed a lift he can ask for that but I\u2019m not giving him my car keys not a chance.", "Very soft YTA. Yes the situation sucks but from your comments, there\u2019s literally very little that she can do besides borrowing your car; no public transportation, no Uber/taxi, etc. Sure you can teach her a lesson in responsibility but this is a huge opportunity for her as you mentioned and at the end of the day someone or another is going to need to \u2018bail her out\u2019 because there\u2019s literally nothing else she can do beyond getting a ride/borrowing a car from someone else. Obviously if the damage she\u2019s in the past is comprable to crashing a car or anything similar then maybe not, but the vibe I\u2019m getting is that the stuff that she did is not on the same level. You mentioned wanting her to learn responsibility but this is her being responsible by reaching out and maybe getting this job will get her to be more serious about her future.\nAnother commenter mentioned getting a \u2018deposit\u2019 from her (expensive jewelry, money, etc.) to make sure she has incentive to bring back the car in one piece and give you the car back if you want to think about something like that", "I think YTA but it\u2019s nearly a NAH. You can\u2019t currently drive and your sister needs the car for the interview. If something goes wrong get your parents to step in, you can arrange this before giving her the keys. It wouldn\u2019t have made any difference to your day if she borrowed your car. But you don\u2019t have to lend anyone your things if you don\u2019t want to. You could have been helpful but deliberately aren\u2019t. To me that makes you TA but I think for many others it doesn\u2019t because it\u2019s quite passive.", "Okay in general I'd say N T A if she has a bad track record. But the one thing that makes me think you are probably not approaching it right is your third reason. Its great that you believe in personal responsibility and accountability, and its nice that you want your sister to also exhibit those traits and values. But it is really not your responsibility to teach her that. \n\nSaying you wanted to \"encourage her to find alternative solutions\" sounds condescending af. Could your sister benefit from guidance there? Maybe. Is she asking for you to be that person to guide her? Doesn't sound like it. I say leave that out of it. If you don't want to lend it to her because you can't trust she won't damage it or return it promptly, those are reasons enough. Its up to her whether she cares to build the trust up on that. Don't try to make it some life lesson. You're her sister not her boss. \n\nI guess I'll vote NAH because this just seems like a normal conflict and I can't tell if you are actually telling her you are trying to teach her some lesson. I don't think your sister is T A for asking.\n\nAs for the family members, why can't they lend a car if they feel like you should say yes? Or offer to take responsibility if something does go wrong?", "YTA\n\nHelp a sister out, Jesus.", "YTA why not just take her? I understand why you didn\u2019t want to lend her your car but I don\u2019t understand why you wouldn\u2019t give her a ride.", "after reading your comments YTA could have just ridden with her in your car , your a huge asshole do you think your sister not getting a job is going to some how help her in life ?", "NTA I think you should drive her to the interview.", "How the hell she getting to work after the interview if she has to borrow your car to get to the interview?

She can rent a car for the day or the month until she gets her first paycheck from that huge company.", "NTA.  You said no.  She'll have to find an alternative.", "NTA. Your car, your rules.", "NTA. There are consequences to being irresponsible. Your sister got what she deserves", "NTA You\nMight consider offering to drive her there and waiting out in the parking lot or nearby where she could text you to pick her up. Alternatively, drop her off and tell her to call an Uber to pick her up. Relying on Uber to get you to appointments on time is risky.", "NTA but what\u2019s the plan if she gets the job?  Also she will keep the car all day, fill it with cigarette butts, scratch it up, use all the gas, give rides to creeps and use it to rob a bank.", "NTA. Those family members are free to let her borrow their car. She can Uber, Lyft, take a bus, etc to get to the interview. Given her past actions you are right not to trust her with your car.", "NTA\u2026tell those family members that they can be supportive by lending Sis their cars.", "NTA, it's yours you don't need a reason to not give it to her. But maybe offer to drop her off or smt and if she refused then that's her fault.", "YTA. Your sister needs help. She would have her own insurance if anything happened which is very unlikely anyway. \n\nHas she ever had an accident before? \n\nIt's a car, not a necklace. How the fuck is she going to keep it on you? \n\nBelieving in personal responsibility is a bullshit excuse. I'm assuming you have never let a single person help you out in the past because of this belief. You wouldn't want to be seen accepting help and not being personally responsible.", "Nta. But let's address something. Lending your car even to someone in need is just plain stupid. Never let someone drive your car if they're not on your insurance. Period. Cars aren't something that just gets loaned. They're huge investments and for some, losing their transportation is the difference between surviving and living.", "NTA.

I understand your concern but \"A job interview at a prestigious company that could potentially be a game-changer for her career' does sound like something that  it would be important for you to help with  help with, if she doesn't have friends/ other family  who can take her. And for other posters,just want to say that  in the USA most car rental companies won't rent to anyone under the age of 25. \n\nCan you let her use the car and make it very clear that has it ONLY for that time?

Having one of these people who think op should do it give her a ride instead.", "Sorry to disagree, but a hard NTA from me. \n\nI think that OP\u2019s reasoning is solid enough. But as a Director of HR, we always ask the transportation question.
