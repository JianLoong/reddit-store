Recently, my sister landed a job interview at a prestigious company that could potentially be a game-changer for her career.\n\nThe issue arose when she realized she didn't have a car of her own to get to the interview location. She came to me, asking if she could borrow my car for the day. Now, normally, lending a car to someone in need would be a no-brainer, but here's why I said no.\n\nFirstly, my sister has a history of being careless and irresponsible with other people's belongings. Numerous incidents have occurred in the past where she's damaged or lost things that were entrusted to her care. I simply couldn't risk having my car damaged or involved in an accident due to her negligence.\n\nSecondly, my sister has a habit of not returning borrowed items in a timely manner. There have been instances where she conveniently \"forgets\" to return things for weeks or even months, causing frustration and tension between us. Given her track record, I couldn't trust that my car would be returned promptly, which could inconvenience me if I needed it.\n\nLastly, I believe in personal responsibility and accountability. My sister has relied on others to bail her out of situations throughout her life. By refusing to lend her my car, I wanted to encourage her to find alternative solutions and take responsibility for her own transportation needs.\n\nNow, my sister and some family members are upset with me, calling me selfish and unsupportive. They believe that I should have put our differences aside and helped her out in a time of need.
