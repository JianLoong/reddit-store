Your wife and SIL enable her even when your daughter and her friends try to stand up for themselves(as per your comments) AND JENNIE PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED YOUR DAUGHTER to the point she needed medical attention. \n\n\n\nSir, you need to set boundaries with SIL and Jennie and have a firm discussion regarding the same with your wife.

Keeping your daughter and your home safe from your niece should be your first priority. Not only yours but your wife's too though. She is TA.", "NTA...If physical altercations are occurring in your home, and involving your child, you can say whatever you need to.", "NTA! I had a cousin similar to Jennie and I WISHED my parents would tell her the things you said. I'm annoyed by the opinion your wife and SIL hold.", "NTA\n\nYour wife and in-laws are encouraging Jennie's behavior. Instead of *parenting* her, they are more interested in being her friend. It also sounds like it's too late for the course to be corrected and Jennie will experience alienation for her life from it aside from people that buy into the \"my poo doesn't stink\" mentality. Your wife and in-laws are TA.", "NTA - may have not phrased it the best but yeah, you were right.", "NTA forcing people to interact isn't a good idea. Your niece's behavior is unacceptable and you and your wife have seen examples of this. You need to sit down with your wife and talk.", "NTA \n\nYour wife and SIL sound like they have lost the entire plot sir. I mean no offense, but it shouldn't have ever reached the point of your daughter undergoing physical harm at all. Jennie is a CHILD, an OUT OF CONTROL CHILD. Your SIL has lost control of her child and your Wife and ILs are making things even worse by ENCOURAGING the lack of control. Jennie needs to be given discipline and structure that she has clearly never been given. If I ever threw a tantrum for something like even just a song not being left on repeat, my dad brought out the belt and my mom brought out the flop in warning. If I continued to misbehave, my ass would get a nice and swift whooping. Don't read this as abuse, because it wasn't. It was enforcement of RULES, IT WAS DISCIPLINE AND STRUCTURE. Discipline and structure that made me grow up into a FUNCTIONAL and WELL BEHAVED ADULT. Consider talking to your sister in law and telling her that Jennie's behaviour is only going to get worse if no structure or discipline is put into action. A child that grows up with no structure or discipline, WHEN NEEDED, becomes an adult without any means of functioning and behaving well and appropriately in Society and the adult world as they grow up not knowing what's wrong or right and what should be done and what should not be done. What's appropriate and what's inappropriate. She also needs to learn about respect of others and their boundaries and the importance of family and friends and certain social norms.\n\nPlease consider setting a boundary with your SIL and her daughter for the safety of your own daughter and of seeking counseling for you and your family about the whole situation. Your wife needs to understand that she should NOT have ever encouraged that behavior as it brought harm upon your child for your child only trying to do the RIGHT THING. Your child also needs to see you all working as a family to set a proper structure and solution to the situation as a UNITED FRONT since you have both been divided on this mess for what seems to be a long time.", "NTA- you have a wife problem if she keeps letting her Niece impose herself into your kid\u2019s life like this . \n\nAlso, file assault charges .", "NTA.\n\nIf your daughter ended up in a clinic because her cousin attacked her, over defending her friend then you are the one in the right.\n\nYou first need to deal with your wife. Ask her why she is defending your daughter's bully. Ask her why Jennie's happiness and social life is more of a priority than her own daughter's joy and safety? You can empathize that she wants her niece to have friends and a full life like your daughter, but that is something that Jennie has to work on for herself and it's not Christy's responsibility. Ask her if she is prepared to have your daughter resent her for not protecting her and failing to consider her well being first. \n\nOP, I would make this my hill to die on in defense of my child. Your wife needs to understand the fact that Christy will need space from Jennie for a good long time with contact only re-established if Christy wants it. She is not to try to guilt her or force her to have someone in her life that makes her miserable.\n\nYour SIL using the excuse that she is a single mom is not relevant to the point that her daughter has some apparent emotional and behavioral issues that she needs help for. It's not your 17 year old's responsibility to be her therapist and emotional support person.", "YTA, because I don't believe this post was actually written by an adult.

Jennie ended up yelling at one of Christy's friends because the one of the guys she had her eye on as a date asked her out instead, and Christy's friend refused. Christy defended her friend and the two of them had an argument which led to Christy being in the clinic.\n\nAgain in case they missed it the first time\n\n>Christy defended her friend and the two of them had an argument which led to Christy being in the clinic.\n\nHow the F can your inlaws and wife overlook that your daughter had to be seen by a doctor after a confrontation with her cousin?!\n\nNTA!", "Because even if I leave her child custody is a problem. With my condition (psychopathy) it is highly unlikely for me to get 50/50 custody.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138v0uq/comment/jj1zzud/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138v0uq/comment/jj1zzud/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nEven if I do get 50/50 custody its still going to be hell for Christy because I won't be able to interfere/ help her with my wife, SIL, and Jennie (or as Chris likes to call them The Mean Girls). I don't trust my wife to even have partial custody of Christy", "If I knew she was going to be like this I wouldn't have had a child with her. She only showed this side when Christy was 5", "At least she's almost an adult. I hope for Christy's safety and your ability to escape one day.", "Your daughter is 17 ... custody of who? You have others kids?", "Your daughter in one year max is turning 18, even in some months.. why is the judge ordering her to choose her mother? This doesn't make any sense...", ">she knows its okay to stand up for herself\n\nShe knows how to stand up for herself. I'm not sure why she told me it was okay, but Christy is very strong and won't tolerate people who are causing her discomfort. The arguments she has with Jennie are huge, however they don't have any affect because nothing short than banning her from all the places Christy and her friends visit is going to stop Jennie.", "Your daughter is already an adult op, some months earlier dont change this fact... she can choose live with you or even on her own... no one can force her to live with her mother being abused by her and her cousin/aunt... \n\nYou staying is actually doing more bad than good to her...\n\nYou leaving, you can provide a safe place to her live without being abused by your wife until she can become independent", ">She wasn't this bad until Christy was born (No fault to Christy). Christy wasn't the daughter my wife wanted while Jenny sort of is. This probably plays a big role too.\n\nIf you're wife hates her own daughter that much that she'd let her be abused by her sister's kid then you need to leave her and take your daughter with you to be safe! Then the whole awful family can be together and more importantly christy can be away from her abusive relatives."]}
