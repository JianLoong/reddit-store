Jennie is spoiled and a killjoy. Some examples:\n\n1. She is obsessed with BTS. Toxic obsessed. And when during a family gathering they refused to play a certain BTS song again, they got sick of listening to it because she made them repeat the same song 15 times, she threw a temper tantrum in front of everyone\n2. She stopped talking to her brother because the new guy she had a crush on refused to date her and became friends with her brother\n3. She tattled on a kid throwing a pool party, because she got uninvited to it because she insulted the kid throwing the party\n\nAnd these are the the least horrible examples I can remember.\n\nI try to throw a stop Jennie's behavior however my wife and SIL encourage it.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back was yesterday.

Your house your rules. But why are Christy and her friends not showing a bit of backbone and telling Jennie where to go?", "NTA\n\n\nLet me get this straight. \n\n\nJennie forces herself on your daughter\u2019s group. Your wife and SIL enable her even when your daughter and her friends try to stand up for themselves(as per your comments) AND JENNIE PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED YOUR DAUGHTER to the point she needed medical attention. \n\n\n\nSir, you need to set boundaries with SIL and Jennie and have a firm discussion regarding the same with your wife. And keep your daughter away from Jennie. \n\n\nIn no universe could you possibly be the AH.", "Your daughter needed medical treatment?  And you think you might be TA?", "Info: when you say\n\n>Christy defended her friend and the two of them had an argument which led to Christy being in the clinic.\n\nDo you mean Jennie like... physically assaulted your daughter? \ud83d\ude2c", "NTA. Keeping your daughter and your home safe from your niece should be your first priority. Not only yours but your wife's too though. She is TA.", "NTA...If physical altercations are occurring in your home, and involving your child, you can say whatever you need to.", "NTA! I had a cousin similar to Jennie and I WISHED my parents would tell her the things you said. I'm annoyed by the opinion your wife and SIL hold.", "NTA\n\nYour wife and in-laws are encouraging Jennie's behavior. Instead of *parenting* her, they are more interested in being her friend. It also sounds like it's too late for the course to be corrected and Jennie will experience alienation for her life from it aside from people that buy into the \"my poo doesn't stink\" mentality. Your wife and in-laws are TA.", "NTA - may have not phrased it the best but yeah, you were right.", "NTA forcing people to interact isn't a good idea. Your niece's behavior is unacceptable and you and your wife have seen examples of this. You need to sit down with your wife and talk.", "NTA \n\nYour wife and SIL sound like they have lost the entire plot sir. I mean no offense, but it shouldn't have ever reached the point of your daughter undergoing physical harm at all. Jennie is a CHILD, an OUT OF CONTROL CHILD. Your SIL has lost control of her child and your Wife and ILs are making things even worse by ENCOURAGING the lack of control. Jennie needs to be given discipline and structure that she has clearly never been given. If I ever threw a tantrum for something like even just a song not being left on repeat, my dad brought out the belt and my mom brought out the flop in warning. If I continued to misbehave, my ass would get a nice and swift whooping. Don't read this as abuse, because it wasn't. It was enforcement of RULES, IT WAS DISCIPLINE AND STRUCTURE. Discipline and structure that made me grow up into a FUNCTIONAL and WELL BEHAVED ADULT. Consider talking to your sister in law and telling her that Jennie's behaviour is only going to get worse if no structure or discipline is put into action. A child that grows up with no structure or discipline, WHEN NEEDED, becomes an adult without any means of functioning and behaving well and appropriately in Society and the adult world as they grow up not knowing what's wrong or right and what should be done and what should not be done. What's appropriate and what's inappropriate. She also needs to learn about respect of others and their boundaries and the importance of family and friends and certain social norms.\n\nPlease consider setting a boundary with your SIL and her daughter for the safety of your own daughter and of seeking counseling for you and your family about the whole situation. Your wife needs to understand that she should NOT have ever encouraged that behavior as it brought harm upon your child for your child only trying to do the RIGHT THING. Your child also needs to see you all working as a family to set a proper structure and solution to the situation as a UNITED FRONT since you have both been divided on this mess for what seems to be a long time.", "NTA- you have a wife problem if she keeps letting her Niece impose herself into your kid\u2019s life like this . \n\nAlso, file assault charges .", "NTA.\n\nIf your daughter ended up in a clinic because her cousin attacked her, over defending her friend then you are the one in the right.\n\nYou first need to deal with your wife. Ask her why she is defending your daughter's bully. Ask her why Jennie's happiness and social life is more of a priority than her own daughter's joy and safety? You can empathize that she wants her niece to have friends and a full life like your daughter, but that is something that Jennie has to work on for herself and it's not Christy's responsibility. Ask her if she is prepared to have your daughter resent her for not protecting her and failing to consider her well being first. \n\nOP, I would make this my hill to die on in defense of my child. Your wife needs to understand the fact that Christy will need space from Jennie for a good long time with contact only re-established if Christy wants it. She is not to try to guilt her or force her to have someone in her life that makes her miserable.\n\nYour SIL using the excuse that she is a single mom is not relevant to the point that her daughter has some apparent emotional and behavioral issues that she needs help for. It's not your 17 year old's responsibility to be her therapist and emotional support person.", "YTA, because I don't believe this post was actually written by an adult. Seriously, what adult is this involved in teenage girl drama to do the degree that they mention BTS? And what adult writes things like this about a teenager girl: \"And you can clearly see that they all hate her. And frankly I don't blame them.\" I have an overwhelming feeling, this post is actually a teenage girl writing about why she's mad at a girl in her friend group.", "OFC she is a BTS fan... NTA!", "YTA\n\nTelling your SIL that \"needs to get a life...\" is not kind or useful.\n\nI see this like how one should approach your boss/management when there is a problem at work.  First identify the core, underlying problem.  Make sure that this is the real problem rather than the symptom.  Make sure that they understand and agree with your assessment. Then offer solutions/options and the reasons why they might work.  Offer your preference and why.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
