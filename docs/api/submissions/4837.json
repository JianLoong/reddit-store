My daughter asked, since her brother got a pet on his tenth birthday, can she as well. I said yes, that is very fair, but it will be with the same conditions. She has to pick up after and do all the work. All I'll do is buy supplies and pay vet bills.\n\nDaughter decided she wanted a pet mouse, and we got her one for her tenth birthday in July. Now, my daughter quickly developed a troubling habit. She liked to take her mouse out of its cage and play with it, which is fine, but she would often set him down for \"just a second\" to do something and he would run off. After the third time of the entire family searching for and finding Mickey I told her that she needs to put him back in his cage whenever she isn't holding him, even if it's for a second, because we aren't going to help her again. The mouse is her responsibility.\n\nWell, yesterday she lost the mouse again when playing with him before school. She started freaking out and saying we all needed to help her find him. I said no, her father and I have to go to work, and her brother has school. However, I did tell her I would let her skip school to look for him. I said I'd come home on my lunch break and get her to take her to school, thinking she'd definitely find him in that time.\n\nShe was very upset that we wouldn't stay and help her, but I refused to argue, so that was that. When I got home four hours later, she hadn't found the mouse yet and was \"taking a break\" from looking playing on her iPad. She asked me to help her look, and I said no. She wasn't looking, so she's going to school. She can look for him more after school. Again, she was upset, but she wasn't even looking for him.\n\nWhen we all got home, we found the mouse, but it is as too late. Ace had tried to play with him or maybe even tried to eat him. We can't be sure. We buried Mickey in the backyard. My daughter is demanding that Ace be rehomed, because she said looking at him triggers her. I said no. What happened to Mickey is horrible, but it wasn't Ace's fault.\n\nDaughter said I'm heartless and evil, and that I'm trying to torture her emotionally because she didn't listen. That's not true. I am sad for her, but the fault isn't Ace's. I told her to keep Mickey in a cage. But she spent all last night crying and today she spent all afternoon in her room crying, refusing to even eat dinner.

When you get a pet, you\u2019re responsible for a life. A lot of kids learn this the exact same way. It\u2019s not the dog\u2019s fault and it\u2019s sure as hell not her brother\u2019s fault.", "I\u2019m a bit of a bleeding heart and I feel bad for Mickey, but NTA vote from me. You shouldn\u2019t punish the dog for behaving like a dog, and I don\u2019t think you should have dropped everything to help your daughter find her mouse, you gave her plenty of warning. You definitely shouldn\u2019t replace the pet until she proves she\u2019s responsible enough to look after one properly - they shouldn\u2019t suffer because she can\u2019t.", "People might call my heartless but.. NTA imo. Sooner or later we all have to learn that actions have consequences", "NTA The dog probably didn't know what it was doing was wrong, and the time for it understanding why you are disiplinening it has passed. It was an accident, and removing the dog serves no purpose other than more grief. Best you can do is show her that you are also sad about what happened and make her feel less alone, and that you will get through the loss together.", "NTA \n\n\n\nYou told her she shouldn\u2019t keep him out of his cage. She got lazy and gave up looking for him and played on the iPad instead.\nIf you\u2019d take the dog away you wouldn\u2019t just punish the dog, who did nothing wrong (that\u2019s the course of life and nature) but also your son. Your son is going to resent you if you take away his dog, who is also a part of the family and his friend. That would be cruel. Your daughter wasn\u2019t ready for a pet and needs to learn responsibility. It now seems like the end of the world but it could be a lesson and she could learn how to deal with grief.\n\n\nIf you\u2019d take Ace away from your son you\u2019d be heartless and a really bad mother. You\u2019d favor your daughter (so she\u2019d \"forgive\" you) over your son, his feelings and his friend.

It's important for her to learn to process grief and the strong emotions associated with it.   \n\n\n3 suggestions:   \n1) You might ask if she wants to hold a memorial service for Mickey.  This can help with closure. It may be important for the family to acknowledge her loss. \n\n2) If she continues to be distraught, if there is an easy way to pull it off, send Ace for a few day vacation so your daughter can regroup emotionally. This might be playing at a fun dog camp or staying with a friend (but only if Ace will do well in that environment). \n\n3) The blame cycle needs to stop. You can stop reminding her that you told her to keep Mickey in the cage.  When she blames you and Ace, give the same exact response, \"I'm sorry that you lost Ace. I know it's hard.\"   Once she hears this 10 times (or 1,000), the emotional charge will run dry. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA. She was clearly not ready for the responsibilities of a pet.", "NTA. Your daughter needs to get over herself. The dog did what dogs do. It isn't to blame for her irresponsibility.", "NTA - Adog is gonna dog. Your daughter is going to feel guilty fir awhile but as hard as it us she needs to understand that thus is HER fault, not the dog's. She set this disaster up. I know she's young so it will need to be couched more gently, but she's not being fair to the dog.", "NTA about the dog, bit Y T A overall. When you have a child who is not mature enough to care for a living thing, you don't get to wash your hands of it. You are the adult and if the animal isn't being well cared for, you step in or re-home it. Living beings shouldn't be life lessons.\n\nAlso, \"My 10 year old is staying home alone to look for a mouse\" is not an appropriate reason to not go to school, and as an elementary school teacher I guarantee you that the office is talking so much shit about that.", "NTA for defending the dog, but YTA for how you handled the situation, well you and your partner for that matters. Yes, it's your daughter fault for letting her pet wandering around alone but you knew the dog could kill the mouse and you didn't even try to help that poor mouse, it wasn't his fault your daughter wasn't responsible enough to have a pet yet he paid for her irresponsability and her parents negligence with his life.", "NTA \u2026.. I do think it\u2019s sad, and I feel for her but I truly think this is one of those incredibly valuable lessons where she was lucky and learned early in her life.", "NTA, hopefully this will be a learning experience for your daughter.\n\nMy nephews went through something similar. They had a cat that liked chew up and eat the foam ammunition in their nerf guns. Their parents constantly told them pick up the ammo when they were done playing with their nerf guns. They would constantly leave the ammo lying around and one day the cat got really sick. They took the cat to the vet and they tried to perform life saving surgery. They removed a pile of chewed up nerf ammunition that had caused a blockage in the cat's digestive track. Sadly the cat didn't survive the surgery. My nephews were devastated but they learned from that loss. Several months later they got another cat and still have her today. They never left any nerf ammo or anything else around for the new cat to chew up and eat.", "Oh for goodness sake. NTA. The dog was being a dog.

I\u2019m surprised the dog didn\u2019t get hold of Mickey earlier, given this was the third time it happened. I feel badly for Mickey, but there is exactly one person to blame here and it\u2019s your daughter. I\u2019m not saying that she is a bad kid, just that this was her mistake and that was the result. I think Y W B T A if you forced your son to rehome Ace.", "NTA The dog doesn't need punished. The kid who's irresponsibility killed an innocent creature needs punished but I'm sure she'll punish herself enough. Sad situation all around.", "ESH. If you ask your daughter not to do something again - and she does it again - you don't let her skip school to deal with it. On her end she is clearly irresponsible and it would behoove you all not to allow her to have another animal who would likely be put at risk.", "NTA. But watch her like a hawk because she is going to go after the dog. And no more pets, she is too irresponsible.", "I work in the veterinary field and am very sad for Mickey but NTA. What Ace did was not maliciously. Animals don't do things out of malice. It is, unfortunately, her fault for not taking care of Mickey.", "NTA, and I'd advise keeping a very close eye on the dog. Maybe I'm just too jaded at this point, but I can definitely foresee some Drano mysteriously ending up in his food. Spoiled kids are creative when it comes to revenge.", "YTA, but not because of the dog. You don't punish animals for being animals.\n\nYour daughter was abusing her pet, and this ending was inevitable given her behavior. After the first time the mouse got free you should have been very clear about the consequences.\n\nYour daughter feels bad, and she should feel bad. Her pet is dead because of her own actions. And you are an asshole for letting it happen.", "NTA. I\u2019d rather rehome your daughter instead. What a neglectful brat, caused an innocent mouse to die a terrible death.", "YTA but not for holding your daughter responsible for her agreements, but for allowing an animal to die because of neglect and mistreatment. And when you came home and saw your daughter on the iPad instead of finding her pet you didn\u2019t immediately ground her from electronics\u2026.if it had been a dog or cat or horse or snake, you would probably have not let your kid \u201cnot look for her lost pet.\u201d \n\nYour lesson should have been fine the pet and rehome it. And make your daughter explain exactly why she is rehoming her pet because she is a bad pet owner. And you should have done it after the second time she didn\u2019t follow your agreement. At least then your daughter would just be upset and not her upset and A LIVING CREATURE died for you to prove your point. \n\nAlso you want to pay very close attention to what happens to ACE, I would bet he somehow \u201cgets out\u201d when daughter doesn\u2019t get her way. \n\nYou need to do better as parents!!!", "ESH.

Not for not punishing the dog, but for being so flippant about a mouse. You are still the adult. You still make sure the animals are taken care of.

I find it just incredibly infuriating how some people just go \"oh well it's a mouse\". When mice are wonderful pets, and OP has a responsibility as the adult to... you know.

It is not any indicator whatsoever of someone being emotionally unsound \ud83d\ude44", "They really need to put fiction disclaimers on all these cop shows everyone is watching. People are getting paranoid.", "Seek therapy dude", "I don't know if OP was thinking \"oh well it's just a mouse\" or if they were letting their daughter adjust to having a pet. The first time it happened, I can see parents going \"okay, they're young, they've never had a pet before so they're still figuring out what to do but they'll learn from this, it was an accident.\" The second time they probably should have said something, but I can see how a parent would pass it off as \"making new habits are hard and sometimes ppl slip up, but let's keep an eye on the aituation and say something if it happens again.\" \n\nIf OP had let it go on past that third time without saying something, I would definitely be on their case, but I think three times is *just* enough of a grace period. It's not great, and I do think OP would have been better off saying something beforehand. And I think part of why OP probably wasn't more concerned of the consequences was bc they didn't think there would be a big one like this.

I hope you and OP are right!", "I remember being 10 and picking up words that I understood in context but didn't understand the meaning of and I used them correctly because I understood where they went in sentences, so everyone thought I was smart or some shit because I used big words. I can't tell you how many times I've seen the word \"triggered\" this week alone. The daughter simply could have picked it up by seeing a \"trigger warning\" somewhere on some random video. I'm pretty sure there's a post in this sub about a girl being triggered (not to downplay her situation) and asking to change rooms within the last 24 hours. It's a word that is literally everywhere these days to the point the meaning of the word is almost lost. \n\nI'm also pretty sure I learned the rest of those words at age 10 from like, DBZ or some other media that was actually questionable in the 90s in hindsight."]}
