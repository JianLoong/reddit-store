He can sit on the other side of the bleachers or auditorium and never even SEE her! My mom is perfectly content to do just that and doesn't want to have to miss anything. This is all dad. I told him there's really no reason he can't go to, say, a school play and just sit as far away from mom as possible.

He's there for the kids if he can't look it it that way then it's a personal problem. Your younger sibs don't see it this way because they don't have kids yet, It's weird but once you have kids you realize that you do a lot of things for your children, and grandchildren...

Should he still have to be in her presence? Or what if it were reversed and dad had an affair and mom didn\u2019t want to be around him? Should he then be excluded from all events? Context is important but in this case OP isn\u2019t getting involved and trying to find common ground which is the healthy way of handling split families, her parents baggage is their baggage not her and she clearly wants to maintain a relationship between her parents and herself/her children.", "But OP is merely telling dad that she won't separate events and it's up to him to come or not and pointing out he need not socialize with mom", "Again put yourself in either parents shoes mom is just fine because in the current scenario dads the one left out and she\u2019s with the family, if it were reversed and they all sat with dad and she were alone im sure anyone would have issue with that. While dad feels excluded because he doesn\u2019t want to be around his ex wife. OP has a sound comprise as long as they do has they have replied to one of my comments\u2026ensure dad doesn\u2019t feel left out from the family.", "OP has provided the option for dad to sit with, or not sit with the family while he believes mom should be excluded", "Go read the post again, he proposed a rotation. In the solution in the post dad could sit as far away from mom as possible. No where in the original post was it suggested for her spouse or her to sit with dad. That was later added in a reply from OP to one of my posts. You\u2019re grasping at straws with no evidence in the original post. While dads suggestion is fair to himself and OPs mother it requires both of them missing events which I agree if you\u2019re not okay with it it isn\u2019t fair. OP also pointed out her mother is biased, now why would mom be biased? A safe assumption could be given the current circumstances dad would have to sit by himself, OR mom could be at fault for the divorce. Again as I\u2019ve stated that part of context for the divorce will never been known but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that OPs mother is biased, and you clearly are as well.", "My premise is that both parents are invited to all events which is fair treatment. Forcing one to miss events because the other is avoidance isn't fair. Not requiring them to sit together is fair. \n\nDad can choose to sit with family but does not.\n\nMy grandparents were divorced and because grandma hosted holiday dinners and grandparents lived with us, she hosted him too.\n\nMy aunt and uncle were divorced and did what was best for their kids, sucked it up for activities. We saw them for Christmas eve ever after because his family lived a couple hours away and he needed drive time.\n\nYes, I'm biased from the standpoint I expect adults to act like adults and know it can be done.", "That\u2019s a fun take it\u2019s pretty easy to list your own life experiences and expect to that to be the global standard. Here\u2019s some for you:\n\nMy parents had a healthy divorce, father was at fault but they still coparented in a healthy fashion.\n\nSame goes for my sister and her ex.\n\nBut then there\u2019s my brother who had a toxic divorce and suffered from it to have his ex wife apologize down the road.\n\nI\u2019ve known friends who were both male and female on the receiving end in a positive and negative light.\n\nThe reality of it is that you can\u2019t guarantee people to divorce amicably and clearly OP\u2019s parents haven\u2019t. I still fail to see in writing where OP is stating their father expects mom to excluded.\n\nI safe assumption is OPs father doesn\u2019t want to see their ex and have to sit alone while doing so. Which brings us full circle to OPs solution which is either they or their spouse sit with their father. Which is both MATURE and FAIR to both parents. Which I also stated in a comment to them if their dad has issue with that they\u2019re petty, and same goes for their mother."]}
