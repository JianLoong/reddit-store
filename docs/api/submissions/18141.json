Someone will inevitably complain that the other is getting \u201cbetter\u201d events, more time, etc. and it turns into a ridiculous arms race. Especially with a wedding in the near future your Dad just needs to learn to deal.", "NTA\n\n> But he can easily attend these things without having to! He can sit on the other side of the bleachers or auditorium and never even SEE her! \n\nYour dad is being a childish asshole, and it\u2019s unfair to the kids to only have one grandparent at their events at a time over this. We all have to learn how to exist along with people we don\u2019t like. What does he want to teach his grandkids? That you can put a petty fight above relationships?\n\n(And yes, refusing to be in the same building as someone you\u2019re not even going to speak to because a divorce turned hostile is petty.)", "NTA\n\nYour dad is free to rotate his body around the room away from his ex, if he can't focus on his grandkids while seeing her.\n\nFrom what you've said it sounds like your dad is trying to punish his ex by making it where she'll have no choice but to miss an event, if he gets his way.\n\nHe doesn't want equal time or opportunity for both. He's also forcing his children to not get to enjoy their mom. \n\nIf your mom isn't bothering him at these events then that confirms that he's being an just for the hell of it and doing at her and his kids and grandkids expense.", "NTA. This is really your dads issue. So now he has a choice; show up for his grandchildren and just not interact with your mom. Or don\u2019t go and he can explain to his grandchildren that he is not there because he does not want to see his ex wife.", "NTA. I go thru this withy in-laws who any combination of is not speaking to each other at a given time. Thanksgiving dinner (or whatever) is at 3, would love it it if you came.\nI don't answer questions about whether so and so is coming, I just say I invited everyone so come if you are comfortable. Most come, some don't but I'm not gonna stress cuz you mad at someone this month.", "NTA. Even if your parents both want to rotate events, they need to coordinate that themselves. It is not your job to manage their divorce.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIf he wants an \"event rotation,\" then he needs to handle that discussion with your mom. **HE** is asking for a rotation to solve **HIS** problem, which means it's **HIS** responsibility to deal with setting it up.\n\nIt's **NOT** your problem that he can't communicate in a civil manner with your mom; therefore, it's **NOT** your responsibility to play middle-man by handling communication and generating a schedule for him.", "Tell your mom to stop giving the lawyers all the money and settle fair for the grandchildren then. He spent his entire life working for his family and she canned him to die alone in retirement. Now she's likely grabbing everything that isn't nailed to him. Why should he want to be near her.", "Don\u2019t get in the middle of it and don\u2019t be the keeper of the schedule. If they do want to see each other, it\u2019s their problem. They can work it out between them.", "NTA- he\u2019s acting like a child", "Not to mention that a parent with a million kid activities to coordinate doesn't need to worry about even more logistics for each event, big or small, for no good reason.", "They should organize attendance at the event, not yours, because that's their problem", "This makes me wonder if op\u2019s dad was the one never willing to compromise in the marriage and just assumes he always gets his way. Op is NTA regardless.", "Totally agree- though I don\u2019t have kids and can see it\u2019s ridiculous to rotate events like this. Actually my cynical brain is saying it\u2019s a power move for grandpa, he feels this way then he can get his ex excluded from events, make her miss it- maybe use specific ones as bargaining chips to get what he wants in the divorce\u2026\n\nI\u2019m probably just reading too much into it but if they\u2019re not the type to cause a scene and there\u2019s no big dramatic trauma with seeing each other than this to me is the most logical reason why someone would push for this.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong I know there are exes that this is necessary- those who cannot be in the Same room without it turning into a huge mess or even those with actual restraining orders or what have you- but this doesn\u2019t sound like the case here.\n\nNTA- dad needs to act like an adult and put the kids first. Mom is onboard so if dad wants to throw a temper tantrum and say \u2018well if she\u2019s going I\u2019m not!\u2019 Then unfortunately he\u2019s gonna end up missing a lot of his grandchildren\u2019s events just for his own stubborn pride.\n\nYour siblings are na\u00efve and really not thinking about this. Why does grandpa need to insist on this? Why is it okay to hurt one parent to placate another\u2019s demands? Why should grandma miss half her grandkids special events just because grandpa decided he didn\u2019t want to be in the same crowd as her? \n\nNTA - I honestly think this is just a crappy power move and a way for grandpa to get leverage in the divorce. He\u2019s a grown man he can Suck it up and set in a packed crowd a good distance from his ex.\n\nThe only rotating I\u2019d consider is alternating who you sit with at these events (one with mom next with dad) but that\u2019s it.", "No reason they can\u2019t switch who gets to sit with OP and who sits on their own\n\nAlso Ops husband can sit with the other one\n\nThe kids shouldn\u2019t have to have one grandparent missing each event \n\nKids shouldn\u2019t have to miss grandma because grandad won\u2019t share", "Why should the kids not get to have grandma at an event? \n\nWhy should the kids be punished?", "Sounds like you are handling it well. I know parents can make things so dang complicated.   \n\nGood luck!!", "I think the situation would be different if it was an abusive marriage, if this is all just pettiness or resentment then it's on your dad to decide what's more important. Being an active father and grandparent, or trying to punish your mom by having her barred from family events. Whether he views it as punishment or not, that's what it is. Give it time, don't uninvited anyone, and he should come around.", "My dad was a total prick to my mom after their divorce and I won\u2019t get into all of it but she was wronged in so many ways. Financially, personally, with custody (she had to move away from everyone she knew to keep custody because he could afford the better lawyer, which was also his fault because of financial abuse) and after all was said and done she STILL WENT to family holiday events for me because a) my family liked her (more than his later ex and new wife) and b) she thought it was unfair that i\u2019d have to choose or deal with the split holidays and c) she didn\u2019t want me to resent my dad because he was the clear AH even when I was that age. Your dad can suck it up \u201cfor the kids\u201d if he stayed together for them, especially the grandkids.", "It's still your invite list."]}
