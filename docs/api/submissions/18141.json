The two people who'd she'd been closest to before the divorce and grandpa's death. She asked his best friend to walk her down the aisle instead and that man moved heaven and earth and got dad to be there to give her away. And the rest of us refuse to have weddings.

Not that it helped, because last summer I had to contact him wrt the sale of a piece of land and he used exactly the same tactics on me as he did on my mom 27 years ago, reaping \u20ac2700 for his effort (good to know how much he rates a relationship with me, I guess...?)\n\nIf OP's father is trying to extort her mother by barring her from family events, or if OP's mother is the cause of the divorce proceedings turning hostile, IMO OP should look into that. Keeping out of it is only enabling the bully (whoever that may be in this case), is that the example you want to set for your kids?\n\nAlso, \"you don't have to see each other\" sounds like a fake and ridiculous argument, imo.\nLike, who comes to a school play and then doesn't wait around to talk to the grandkid you just saw on scene?

His efforts gained him \u20ac2700 to my detriment. \nHowever, all I ever felt was the loss of the money (and that was manageable, thanks to my having a steady job). I was prepared long ago for the emotional reality that he prefers owning \u20ac2700 over a fair relationship with me (where he'd have to give me my fair share of \u20ac1350). \n\nI feel grateful my mom offered me that protection, by showing her own vulnerability. \nIt also means I'd never argue for \"suck it up, stay together for the kids/grandkids as proof you love them\" or \"it's respectful to keep out of your parents' divorce\"", "I see your point... but it's predicated on the fact that your parents are both decent people. \n\nMy sister-in-law's parents are divorced this way.
