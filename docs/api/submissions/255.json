I am friends with two girls (19f both ) whom this post is revolved around. I\u2019ll call them A and B. I have been friends with A and B for about 6 months now. We\u2019ve all never met each other before this. I have always felt excluded in this friend group even when the three of us are always together, but when I bring this issue up to them, they refuse to entertain me at all and insist that I am being too emotional. \n\nFor example, A used to sit with me for classes as we sit in pair and B used to sit with someone else. Last semester the person left so B sat alone, until this semester when A left my table to sit with B which they didn\u2019t tell me about earlier. I was caught off guard during class and asked A about it, to which she answered that she doesn\u2019t have space to sit with me. The other time, we went to watch a movie with B\u2019s friend and roommate together, and when it came time for us to sit, I was sat at the most corner with B\u2019s roommate who I am friendly too but not very close, with B\u2019s friend in the middle, and B and A sitting together. They were laughing and talking the entire movie while I sat alone having occasional conversations with the roommate and felt excluded. \n\nWhen I cried to them about this, B said nothing and A said that I hurt her. We all stay in hostel as well and I am on the 8th floor while A and B are in the 12th and 13th so they\u2019re closer together and always come to class together. A at least listens to whatever I have to say but she\u2019s the type to not really care if she is excluded, but B is the worse of all since she doesn\u2019t care at all even if I\u2019m upset and is the type of person to not give a shit if somebody is upset about something she did. Now they are both thinking that I am irrational, emotional and too sensitive, will I be the asshole if I confront them about this? Or am I just overreacting?", "created_utc": 1667287438, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yj1x0u/wibta_for_confronting_my_friends_for_excluding_me/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

These girls are not your friends.", "Last line of second paragraph is enough. You're not a priority and you deserve to be taken more seriously/valued more. Your feelings that there's something wrong is accurate, your brain is telling you this isn't ok. \n\nFind better friends! Also, if I'm in a group of people, I would never knowingly exclude someone. I would make sure everyone's included. These girls are also inconsiderate and ungracious.", "Just leave. These people obviously don\u2019t respect you or your emotions, so definitely not your friends. Don\u2019t confront them about it either, they don\u2019t deserve the attention. They know what they\u2019re doing because you\u2019ve communicated how you\u2019ve felt and instead of fixing things they\u2019re just gaslighting you.", "YWNBTA  \n\n\nYou need to recognize these two don't see you the way you do. It's not easy making lifetime friends, and it's even harder to keep such friendships going. I would recommend you look for new friends.", "Unfortunately confronting them isn\u2019t going to change anything. They\u2019ve developed a closer friendship with each other than they have with you, which, while painful, is a normal thing that happens sometimes and is their right. You should focus your energy on cultivating friendships with other people.", "I'm veeeeery familiar with this dynamic. There isn't a single thing you can do to change it, and any attempt will backfire.\n\nSpend as little time with them as possible and seek out a new friend. There are so many ways to do that in college"]}
