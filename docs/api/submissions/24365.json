For my fourth period, I got a teacher my brother had in his junior year a year prior. And he complained about this teacher a lot. \n\nWhen I walked into the class, the teacher was sitting people down and I was put in a seat right up front next to the teachers desk. I didn\u2019t care at first cause why would I. Until later, this teacher asked me if I had a brother I said I did and then he said that he was glad he put me in the seat he did so he could keep an eye on me.\n\nI ask what he meant and he said that my brother was such a terrible student and that he was sure I was the same as we are so close in age. I got extremely upset, I told him that by no means was my brother terrible student. He had All A\u2019s and B\u2019s, almost perfect attendance AND he graduated early. \n\nThe teacher said I didn\u2019t know what I was talking about and in that moment I knew why my brother complained about him so much. I told the teacher that I didn\u2019t appreciate the way he was talking about my brother, and that it was inappropriate to be speaking to a student and speaking about a previous student in such manner. He got mad and said I was just like my brother with the talking back.\n\nA friend of mine said I wasn\u2019t talking back, and was only having a conversation . My friend was told to sit down and be quiet. He looked over at me and said to get out because I was being disruptive and making the other students disruptive as well. I said okay, grabbed my things and headed to the office to talk to my counselor to change my schedule so I didn\u2019t have to be in that class anymore. \n\nHe yelled after me but I ignored him and another teacher that I knew pulled me aside and asked what was going on. I told her and she said that while she Saw my point of view, it was still rude to walk out on him like that. \n\nEdit: forgot to mention. My brother wasn\u2019t disruptive either.  He asks a lot of questions, that\u2019s it, and by personal experience, me and most of my family thinks he\u2019s on the spectrum but we haven\u2019t gotten him tested yet. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691702153, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15noob1/aita_for_walking_out_when_a_teacher_told_me_to/", "score": 191, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Of course you leave after that exchange.  They told you to.   If you stay then the first teacher writes you up for disobeying them.  The second teacher doesn't get an opinion.  Document both exchanges, get other students in class to do the same thing.   \n\nWay for that first teacher to poison the entire class against him on the first day.", "NTA.\n\nFollowing someone's commands is not being rude. If anyone else asks you why you walked out, limit your reply to \"because he directly told me to\".

What a day!", "NTA- and be sure to bring up to the school in your counselor and the principal about how they were talking about your brother's personal academic record.  That is private information belonging to him.\n\nNot to mention singling you out because of situations outside of your control.\n\nBut that first one is a big one to push with the school district.

I spent the rest of the year being a total shit to her in tiny ways she could not pin on me. I was never like that before or with any other teacher. She made me that way. Crazy.\n\nFunny part is I never learned why she hated my brother so much. He swore he did nothing to her.

Even if your brother had been the worst kid in the history of the school, you are not your brother. He had no right to assume anything about you and I hope you reported him.

Make a specific complaint about that teacher to the school, ask your parents to back you and other students to confirm the story.\n\nHe's shit talking a previous student, calling you out as basically a liar when you disputed your brother being a bad student who graduated early with great grades, he berated you and assumed you were a bad person based on another student being related and called you out in front of the whole class over this.\n\nEvery part of what he did is obnoxious and awful behaviour for any teacher.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like you should talk to the principal and get statements from the other students.  The fact the teacher is treating you that way and pre-judging you is all sorts of bad.  Don't get me wrong, I typically think parents and students are overly pushy with teachers, but this is well over the line of acceptable behavior.  That teacher deserves to be written up by the school and disciplined, if not fired if others have the same experience too.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA.  I am a teacher, and would never act this way.

This teacher is a bully, and frankly he has no business being around children professionally.", "Sorry, it was rude to obey the instruction to get out???
