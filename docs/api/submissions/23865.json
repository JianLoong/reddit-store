They sound spoiled and seem to be more interested in a future inheritance than your happiness.", "NTA\n\nHere's the fundamental thing that your adult children need to understand (and I say this as a generally very sensible, deeply independent woman nearing 50 who has never relied on a partner financially in my life, so I have no reason to defend nonsense or greed):\n\nAs long as your partner is age-appropriate (which you're right, she is), kind, and brings joy to your life, at this stage your romantic relationships and their financial dynamics are no longer any of your kids' business. Period. \n\nMore specifically: it wouldn't matter if she WERE a \"gold digger\", if you were aware of it and okay with it, and happy with the situation. But also, there's absolutely no evidence that that's the case. At 51 and 62, you are both at very similar stages in your lives (something your kids may not understand, but most of us in middle age absolutely do). And unlike when you were younger, starting careers, raising children, trying to establish yourselves in the world financially . . . there's really nothing wrong with deciding that at this stage of the game, as you near retirement, and if you can afford to do so, that you are happy to support your partner financially and would like to do so. \n\nWhat your kids don't get is that you are entering the second half of your life, and priorities have shifted. It's not about *building* your life anymore, it's about *enjoying* what you've already built. And having lost your wife, I suspect that you understand better than most the importance of investing in joy and the here-and-now while you can. Hence, choosing to support your partner. \n\nI wish that you didn't have to throw your kids out, that they could learn to understand. But if they are adults and being this unkind to someone you love . . . then maybe you're right, and it's time they took some time apart from you. You are NTA, and I wish you much joy in your new relationship.", "NTA, this is a solid parenting choice. Judging by your age, your kids are full adults and if they can\u2019t do the barest minimum of being respectful to your future wife, they don\u2019t get the benefit of your wealth.", "NTA. It\u2019s pretty hypocritical that your children are living rent free but are accusing your partner of being a gold digger.\nTime to cut the apron strings and for them to start becoming adults who pay their own way. I\u2019m so sorry that your children are treating you this way however you deserve to be happy and if they can\u2019t support that then they can start paying their own way", "You\u2019re definitely NTA. \nYour response was *badass.*", "NTA... they are gold diggers\n\nYour age diff does not matter at this stage of your life.

You knew they didn\u2019t like your future wife, and you decided to tell them you were engaged during a party. Could you not have visited them and told them in a calm and quiet setting? I think you have surprised them with the news, which wasn\u2019t necessary.", "Did they do all of that in front of her? I'd accept if my kids didn't like her and told me such but if she's been kind to your kids and they said that and starting yelling with her there that's completely not okay. I wouldn't consider the kids gold diggers tho because gold diggers don't even pay bills. I don't pay rent but I pay bills and buy food for the house hold(my mom sisters and the kiddos) I'm not a gold digger at all but I do know I'm blessed to have the family unit I do and I treat all their men with kindness and respect even tho I don't always like them for my relatives. I have had private conversations about my concerns but I try not to bash and accept if they choose to stay with that person. I don't constantly bring it up either I feel like once you've given advice and your opinion let it be. So my advice is don't force them to like her but definitely remind them if you don't have nothing nice to say don't say anything at all unless of course your fiance is a step mom out the fairy-tales.", "You are right, they are wrong.

Your properties are your to do with as you choose, and you've already been generous with those!\n\nReview your will and other testaments with your lawyer before your marriage to ensure that your wife is taken care of, and your children get what they deserve... I'd posit that since she's 51 your wife is capable and has some savings, so top up her retirement comfort, give each of the children a buck, and donate the rest to your favourite charity?\n\nGood luck, because the screaming from your kids isn't over yet.", "You are well within your rights to ask them to leave.

You\u2019ve been solo for 20 years. You\u2019ve found a late in life love. You have the right to spend every penny on this new relationship and leave your kids nothing (however, I hope that is not your intention). \n\nThat is some entitlement your kids are showing. Maybe working hard, struggling and putting a roof over their own heads is the correct prescription for them Doctor OP. \n\nThey\u2019re upset because they view every $ you spend on yourself or your gf is a $ less for them.", "NTA\n\nSeems like they were banking in *their* inheritance.", "ESH\n\nYou are not TA for sticking up for your chosen partner, but you are for allowing your adult children to live without growing up for 5+ years.

DO NOT change title on any of your assets to your spouse...EVER.  Put things in a trust, to reduce the need and costs for probate.
