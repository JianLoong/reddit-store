You're so so reasonable here.  NTA  \nAnimals as gifts is a TERRIBLE idea 100% of the time unless you're a parent and the recipient is a little child.  \n\n\nHowever, the use of \"butthurt\" seems like something else is afoot here.

He didn't. Instead he's lashing out at you, when he screwed up.", "NTA. Pets should never be gifts unless it\u2019s discussed and agreed upon, etc.", "NTA unless he is going to be looking after the animal he doesn't get a say in what you  have time to care for.\n\nAt east he didn't just present the gift though!", "NTA, but I don\u2019t think the would-be gift is the real issue, OP. Is couple\u2019s counseling an option? Your husband needs to express what\u2019s really going on for him.", "NTA. Pets absolutely can\u2019t be surprise gifts to any person who will be responsible for caring for them. It sounds like he\u2019s never had a bird, too. They can be a handful depending on the personalities.", "Not your fault. Pets cost money and are a lot of work. You can\u2019t just spring an animal on someone out of the blue and expect them to raise it. SMH. \n\nNTA. Final decision.", "NTA NEVER get a pet unless you are ready for it! Good got you.", "NTA\n\nSurprise animals are a horrible gift, and many of them end up in shelters. If you want a new pet it should be discussed together, you\u2019re being responsible by recognizing you don\u2019t have the time to care for any more pets.", "NTA. Someone mentioned couples counseling.  Might be a good idea since his reaction is out of proportion to the trigger.\n\nBTW, a toddler and a puppy are more than enough to keep you both busy.", "NTA. Pets are rarely a good surprise gift, because you\u2019re not just giving the cute animal, you\u2019re also giving the responsibility of taking care of it. \nYour husband is clearly disappointed that his banger of an idea didn\u2019t work out, but pouting for the rest of the day is a kid\u2019s move.", "Oh yay! Thank you for giving me a chore! \nNTA. Pets need to be a joint decision, not a surprise.", "Not at all. It\u2019s another living thing that you have to take care of. It may not seem hard but pets are hard and expensive to take care of especially with a toddler running around.", "NTA", "Pets are 100% responsibilities and obligations and you don\u2019t \u201cgift\u201d a pet without the full advance acceptance of the recipient\n\nNta", "NTA.

Your husband wanted the fun of having the dog but was going to use you for the work of keeping a dog.", "Seems like more here. NTA for not accepting a pet as a gift. That's perfectly reasonable. If it would be a family pet then it's a family discussion, not a Mother's Day gift. If it's your pet you have the right to say no you don't want the added responsibility.\n\nBut how did you get all the way in the pet store, looking at the pet, and discussing it before saying no? Seems like he is more hurt about wasting time than the no, is that correct? Your statement of butthurt is very dismissive of his feelings. And your telling of things he was very dismissive of you. \n\nSeems like there is more here to work through, both sides.", "NTA. And I commend you for being responsible.  I am unfortunately the person who wants stupid shit in our relationship and my SO is the fiscally responsible one, almost to the point of annoyance.

And birds are not easy. They make lots of dirt, need attention and also get ill - the vet isn\u2019t cheap just because they are \"just\" birds. The husband is an asshole that he decides you should just stuff more responsibilities in your not-availible free time. That he reacted so butthurt because you did react grateful...

I have no more bandwidth to care for living beings and told him so. It was a crappy gift .", "This. Pets are a responsibility, not a gift.", "He probably would look after it too ,he wouldn't let an animal suffer as he loves birds just as well but I didn't want him to feel like he has another responsibility on top of everything else if one day I was too busy with everything and didn't have time but then I wouldn't want him to hold it over my head about him then taking care of them", "I was pretty confused at him getting mad at me for being responsible and honest when just the other day he was bitching about finances and then when I changed my mind he then said no nevermind but I don't know exactly what you call someone like that? And I am looking into counseling cause we have other problems as well and when we got home I wanted to cry and was more upset cause I felt like I ruined his day and wasted his time and made him mad.", "He's actually had many pets growing up ,all kinds, reptiles, birds,rabbits,dogs,cats but he has his responsibilities and I have mine but I do believe animals especially birds need human socialization and stimulation and I didn't think I could give them that although if we got a pair they would have each other", "Well as soon as we walked in I was so happy but then reality hit me and I started to think about how I would take care of them and with everything else going on I didn't think it would be a good idea and we stayed as long as we did because my son ended up running around looking at all the animals", "But the weird thing is is that he normally is the financially responsible one and for him to bitch about our finances one day but then allow me to get parakeets the next, I'm confused and yet I'm trying to show him I can be financially responsible but yet I'm the asshole . Unless he thinks I mean that much to him that he would spare financial room for me to get something that would make me happy", ">He probably would look after it too \n\nSo, basically, for mother's day, he . . . planned to buy himself a gift? I mean come on. \n\nAnimals shouldn't be presents. \n\nAnyway, let's break this down. You might have talked about wanting a bird(s),but maybe hypothetically, in the future, when you're less busy. Him taking you to Petco is forcing your hand. Good for you that you held your ground, but then he was offended and kind of ruined your day.\n\nYou say that he will take care of the birds if you don't have time - so how is this a gift for you? And then you say he'll hold it over your head; I mean, what.\n\nNTA\n\nYou guys need to talk, and not about the birds, to be honest.", "You did not ruin his day. We are all in charge of our reactions, and his was out of line for your very correct refusal of his \u201cgift\u201d (in quotes because birds are a lot of work, and you have a toddler and a puppy already).", "Did you know you were going to a pet store as part of a Mother's Day gift? If so, and went anyway I get him bring annoyed. If not, he's being a jerk throwing that out there how could you know? \n\nA puppy and a toddler, you have your hands full. I get not wanting another responsibility. Seems you two may need some counseling to work out some simmering issues. Consider online sessions to get on the same page?"]}
