They\u2019re essentially toddlers that always have scissors in their hands and can fly. They need to be out of their cage a minimum of 4 hours a day, they\u2019re loud, destructive and will bite no matter how friendly they are with you. They throw tantrums and chew furniture and shouldn\u2019t be bought if you have a dog and a young child. They\u2019re a pet that you need to do a lot of research for before getting one as they are a lifelong commitment. Indian Ringneck parakeets live for 40 years as an example. Parrots also typically bond to one person and have the potential to hate anyone they haven\u2019t bonded to. If parrots don\u2019t get the care they need, they can become aggressive and/or start to self mutilate. \n\nNot only do they cause issues, you will need to completely parrot proof your house. No candles, no nonstick pans, no hair straighteners, hair dryers, curling wands, no aerosols, no bleach, no cleaning products that aren\u2019t natural.

Birds are a HUGE commitment. It is actually VERY hard to take care of them.

He was complaining about a 50.00 flea collar?? Not gonna happen. \n\nNTA, pets are not gifts, they are a commitment.", "NTA but your husband has issues.", "NTA.  Birds are time consuming, noisy and destructive.  By parakeets, I'm assuming budgies, which are one of the most vocal birds out there.  They are not as loud as say a macaw or cockatoo, but they chatter a lot.  They sing and talk and make noise all day long.\n\nThe birds themselves are very sadly priced lower than they should be.  Places like Petco push cages that are far too small for birds, of all types.  They also push unhealthy diets.\n\nBirds so require full on lifestyle changes.  No more Teflon, air freshners, smoking, a lot of house plants are toxic to birds (they can and will get into them and chew them).  No perfume or cologne.  No harsh cleaning products in the house.\n\nBirds poop everywhere and they chew on everything.  They get into everything.  \n\nTheir diets need.to be varied, fresh veggies, pellets, with a little bit of seed.  They take up a lot of space. For a single budgie, the association of avian veterinarians suggests a MINIMUM cage size of 24x27\".\n\nYou need a lot of different types of perches, those dolls suck for their feet.  You need real natural wood ones, but you have to be careful with the type because some woods are toxic to birds.  They can't just see a normal vet either, birds need specialized care.  Veterinarians typically only spend a few weeks on their years in school on birds, small mammals (rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs etc) total as a group.  They have very little knowledge of the subtle signs, unless the specialized.  Specialized vets means more $$.  And yes, they also need a yearly checkup\n \nBirds, as prey animals, are very good at hiding illness.  Birds sold in Petco and Petsmart come from mills.  They are often genetically unwell, frequently sick when you get them, and they usually live only 2-3 years, where they should live 7-15.\n\nTldr; birds are expensive and difficult to take care of properly.

They have the mental and emotional capacity of a 3-6 year old child depending on the parrot species and they live a LONG time. (Parakeets living about 8-10 average and macaws living upwards from 60!). Not to mention the initial cost can be very steep!

Shop for all the supplies every time they need something? \n\nIf not, then his gift to you is not actually the birds, it is chores. \n\nI really think though that he just didn\u2019t think that far ahead, or assumed you wanted the birds badly enough that you would be okay with the added responsibility for their care. He had a nice idea, but you\u2019re being practical. Tell him you\u2019d like a rain check on the birds for one day down the road when your life has room for them, and tell him that the offer and knowing he supports making it happen one day is a great gift.\n\nEdit: a word", "Anyone else concerned that she takes care of the toddler and he takes care of the dog? \n\nEven a puppy shouldn\u2019t take so much time you can\u2019t take care of parenting too\u2026", "A girl I went to school with had a macaw and said it was more work than caring for a kid, birds are super high maintenance and need a lot of attention to be happy", "NTA, animals are not gifts and parrots/parrotlets/parakeets are not great pets anyway, due to actually being high needs, no matter what he says.\n\nAlso TBH with two toddlers and a 6 mo puppy, you have your hands full enough.", "NTA.\n\nPeople think parakeets are cheap and easy.\n\nWell, they are, if you give them shitty care.\n\nParakeets are parrots. They require a lot of mental stimulation and tons of room for flying. Small cages won\u2019t do. They also need time out of the cage to fly, and should never mingle with the dog. Plus, then you\u2019d have to spend loads of time with them if you wanted them to be tame/like you. PLUS they may be small but they chatter almost constantly and also make some louder noises sometimes too.\n\nBirds are also SUPER sensitive to a lot of household things. I had to change up a whole bunch of things in my apartment just to be ready for birds. All cookware must be Teflon free. Anything that heats up (hair dryer, space heater, etc) needs to be Teflon free. NO CANDLES. No purfumes. No cleaning products. No air fresheners. Many plants, metals, woods, wood finishes, etc are toxic to birds. Some foods are toxic to birds. \n\nWhen they are well taken care of, they can live into their 20s. Most people think they live 5-8 years. Well, that\u2019s because most people don\u2019t actually care for them properly. \n\nYou made the right choice. NTA!!!", "Thank you for this post. Saved me some typing! I have rescue quail & they're very low-key compared to a parrot, but they're still a lot of work & care to keep them happy & healthy. I work at a chicken rescue, & those birds are seen as being super easy/low time/low cost commitment; they're only that if you're not providing good care.\n\nThere's a reason so many chickens & other birds end up dumped; there's a lot of husbandry knowledge, money & time needed to take care of them *properly*. Too many birds are hatched in mills/hatcheries, shipped off to stores, bought by well-meaning people, & then many of the birds die young bc of lack of proper care/toxins/bad diets or end up surrendered at a shelter/rescue.\n\nOP, NTA. Though when/if you get birds, please check shelters & rescues for friends needing help! Most folks don't even realize birds & small mammals are available to adopt! Adopt A Bird Network on IG & FB is a great resource for finding a feathery someone who needs you \u2764\ufe0f", "But don't worry because if OP just works on her time management she \"could work it out to fit in the time for the birds\"... /s", "Hopefully you already know this, but the last time I got cookware there was a warning on it saying to not use it around birds. Just another thing to keep in mind when having them, they are very sensitive.", "NTA\n\nI think he is looking at the birds in the store, sitting there on the perch and not being jerks, and completely not understanding how time consuming, stressful and complicated owning a bird is. And the long life expectancy. \n\nIf you bring the bird home, it will have completely different behavior than at the store. Obviously. \n\nIf he bugs you about this again, suggest he do bird sitting for someone. (He goes to their house, not the bird coming to yours) \n\nTotally unfair of him to try to get you a \"present\"/ extreme time commitment, when you have a puppy and a toddler.", "NTA.\n\nAnimals ARE NOT gifts. They are a long-term commitment and responsibility.", "Don't worry he takes care of the dog! She only has to manage their kid and the birds then. He's so helpful /s", "100% NTA, nobody should be buying pets as gifts.\n\nPets should be a big decision that is considered over time, not just sprung on someone.", "Whatever happened to good old fashion Chocolates and cards? I see where Opies husband is coming thinking of you liking animals but he should have realize planned better or thought it more through"]}
