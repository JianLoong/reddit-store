The only exception is when parents want to give a minor child (that lives with them).\n\nDeciding when to get an additional animal shouldn't be done under pressure, spontaneously or as a courtesy. \n\nDespite all the viral TikTok videos, gifting an animal rarely goes well.", "NTA- taking care of a bird takes a LOT of work. They\u2019re essentially toddlers that always have scissors in their hands and can fly. They need to be out of their cage a minimum of 4 hours a day, they\u2019re loud, destructive and will bite no matter how friendly they are with you. They throw tantrums and chew furniture and shouldn\u2019t be bought if you have a dog and a young child. They\u2019re a pet that you need to do a lot of research for before getting one as they are a lifelong commitment. Indian Ringneck parakeets live for 40 years as an example. Parrots also typically bond to one person and have the potential to hate anyone they haven\u2019t bonded to. If parrots don\u2019t get the care they need, they can become aggressive and/or start to self mutilate. \n\nNot only do they cause issues, you will need to completely parrot proof your house. No candles, no nonstick pans, no hair straighteners, hair dryers, curling wands, no aerosols, no bleach, no cleaning products that aren\u2019t natural. You have to make sure any plants are safe as they have very sensitive respiratory systems. \n\nI 100% support your decision to say no at this particular time but maybe consider saying no to birds entirely as they\u2019re very difficult pets and really are a lifestyle.", "Birds are very difficult to care for. If you don't have time don't get one!", "NTA. You were being so reasonable and practical. Animals are a long-term responsibility, not a gift.

It's years of dedicated time, energy, space, and money to properly care for any animal.", "NTA.\n\nPets don\u2019t make good gifts. Pets should be a yes/yes decision for everyone who will be responsible for their care. Any no\u2019s should veto the idea. \n\nIt sounds like you have enough on your plate. The birds would not be cared for as they deserve in your care. That\u2019s not a criticism. There is only so much someone can take on in a day, and I think you have enough.", "NTA. Birds are a HUGE commitment. It is actually VERY hard to take care of them. They need a LARGE cage where they can fully fly, daily attention, toys changed out frequently, no contact with the dog... and their dander is dangerous to human lungs so you NEED a HEPA filter if you're going to keep them in your home. He was complaining about a 50.00 flea collar?? Not gonna happen. \n\nNTA, pets are not gifts, they are a commitment.", "NTA but your husband has issues.", "NTA.  Birds are time consuming, noisy and destructive.  By parakeets, I'm assuming budgies, which are one of the most vocal birds out there.  They are not as loud as say a macaw or cockatoo, but they chatter a lot.  They sing and talk and make noise all day long.\n\nThe birds themselves are very sadly priced lower than they should be.  Places like Petco push cages that are far too small for birds, of all types.  They also push unhealthy diets.\n\nBirds so require full on lifestyle changes.  No more Teflon, air freshners, smoking, a lot of house plants are toxic to birds (they can and will get into them and chew them).  No perfume or cologne.  No harsh cleaning products in the house.\n\nBirds poop everywhere and they chew on everything.  They get into everything.  \n\nTheir diets need.to be varied, fresh veggies, pellets, with a little bit of seed.  They take up a lot of space. For a single budgie, the association of avian veterinarians suggests a MINIMUM cage size of 24x27\".\n\nYou need a lot of different types of perches, those dolls suck for their feet.  You need real natural wood ones, but you have to be careful with the type because some woods are toxic to birds.  They can't just see a normal vet either, birds need specialized care.  Veterinarians typically only spend a few weeks on their years in school on birds, small mammals (rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs etc) total as a group.  They have very little knowledge of the subtle signs, unless the specialized.  Specialized vets means more $$.  And yes, they also need a yearly checkup\n \nBirds, as prey animals, are very good at hiding illness.  Birds sold in Petco and Petsmart come from mills.  They are often genetically unwell, frequently sick when you get them, and they usually live only 2-3 years, where they should live 7-15.\n\nTldr; birds are expensive and difficult to take care of properly.  They are not easy.\n\nYou are NTA.   Your husband is just upset because he thought this was a nice gift.  You were 100% right to trust your instincts that you don't have the time for birds.", "NTA. Pets are terrible gifts when you don't have the time, money and/or energy to take care of them. The poor animals would be the ones suffering.", "NTA.

Unless he's successfully run businesseS (plural) before he needs to walk into this new situation with extreme financial caution. \n\nHow old is he? His lack of caution and thinking things through points to him being very young.
