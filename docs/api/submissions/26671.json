I\u2019m already a little wary because by the time we get over there it\u2019ll be 5, she usually likes to spend a good few hours with her mom and that\u2019s fine. I tend to overthink things so at this point I\u2019m thinking we won\u2019t be leaving there until 10 and I should be able to get to bed by 11 if we can get the baby down soon after going home. That leaves me 6 hours of sleep to wake up at 5, get ready and get to work. \n\nWe get to her house around 5:30 after some delays in getting out of the house. We sit and chat for like an hour and a half before I realize we forgot to pack diapers in my sons diaper bag, I tell her I\u2019ll run to Walmart and grab a bag until we get home. She says she\u2019ll come with, which I find odd since she wanted to visit her mom. Either way we head off to Walmart, while in there she says she wants to make dinner for her mom so she\u2019s going to grab a few things. I\u2019m immediately annoyed because I feel like she wanted to do this the entire time but it is what it is. As we\u2019re checking out her mom calls and asks if we can pick up a TV mount for her office and she\u2019ll CashApp the money. \n\nWe grab it and go to check out, everything seems normal as we get back to the house and my wife starts cooking. I make sure my son doesn\u2019t break anything while she does that and all is fine. She finishes cooking around 9:30 and we all eat and finish up about 10:15, I help my wife clean up the dinner dishes and get the kitchen back in order. As we\u2019re wrapping everything up she turns me to me and asks:\n\n\u201cAre you ready to mount my moms tv?\u201d \n\nI\u2019m floored. No mention of this was ever made at any point in the night, I rack my brain to make sure and no it was never mentioned to me. I pull my phone to check the time, 10:45. I try to mask my frustration and mention the time to her and she insists it will only take like 10 minutes. Which might be the case normally if I were able to just go do it myself, but my wife and her mother are extremely particular with this type of thing. I\u2019ve hung TVs before for both of them and it takes at minimum an hour because of all the changes and things they want done.\n\nI\u2019m doing the math in my head and don\u2019t see any way of getting home before 1 AM at this point. We go back and forth quietly in the kitchen before I tell my wife that I\u2019m not going to do it and I\u2019ll swing by on my way home from work tomorrow and do it. She loses it at this point and starts saying that I\u2019m being disrespectful to her mom and that she told her I would do it. I\u2019m trying to process everything but the next 15 minutes are a blur before we get in the car and head home. She doesn\u2019t speak to me the entire ride home, nor when we get home.

I\u2019d also have asked if you were ok doing it before hand.", "NTA.

Even if that's not the case, that still leaves that she has no consideration for you and your time, which is still very bad.\n\nAny possibility your wife was just trying to pick a fight for some reason? This scenario just seems so over-the-top to me.", "Which is unfair to you because your visits with her seem to be nothing more than odd jobs. It's one thing to help with stuff she can't do but it's unfair if she is capable or is just being overly fussy like some seniors are.", "So we have been having problems recently, without going into too much detail but things have been rocky (mildly). So that\u2019s all very possible, this was very much out of left field.", "Well this is starting to make more sense now. Expect more of this if you don't nip this in the bud, either with a frank and coolheaded conversation, or counseling if that doesn't do it. You two have a young child to raise, and that's bound to bring more opportunities to create unnecessary friction, which won't be good for your marriage or the kid."]}
