So your husband only has the kids on the weekend, but according to your comments he also works all weekend, so you're the one taking care of your stepkids AND your bio kids solo until 6-8 pm EVERY Saturday and Sunday? And he's working Mother's Day weekend as well and expects you to do the same thing as you do every weekend?\n\nAs the saying goes on this sub: THE IRANIAN YOGURT IS NOT THE ISSUE HERE. This is NOT a healthy blended family dynamic. You are doing the lion's share of the parenting for both your own kids AND your stepkids and your husband is doing *nothing* to help give you any kind of respite, even on freaking Mother's Day! Taking care of six kids all day is an enormous amount of work no matter how much you love them!", "NTA. Tell him that for Mother\u2019s Day you want him to take all of the kids out of the house and keep them amused for the whole day. Problem solved.", "NTA\n\nLove it! \n\nThe same people that think the man leaving for the entire day on Father's Day to go golfing or something, also think it's some wonderful gift to have some activity for the mother to do with all the children on Mother's Day. The funniest one is Mother's Day brunch wherein the mother gets to prepare nice outfits for all the children, then get up at the crack of dawn to either make them an early breakfast or watch them be in melt downs all morning because they are hungry, get them clean, then wrestle them into their less comfortable 'nice' clothes, then spend ridiculous sums of money trying to get small children to behave in a nice restaurant. And then dad thinks that because they had this nice outing, he's done for the day, and Mother's Day is over. \n\nNew Mother's Day plan: hubby takes all the children all day while you get a spa service, quiet lunch, read a book, go to a movie, whatever. \n\nYou guys have 8 kids between you, best to get this settled asap. \n\nYou get to decide what you do on Mother's Day. Period.", "ESH. Your initial assumption wasn't off base, and your husband *definitely* shouldn't have changed your plans unilaterally, but you know what you never did? Talked to literally anyone about it. \n\nYou should have talked to your husband about your plans, you should have *asked* your stepkids what *they* want - it's important to consider their feelings, even if they *do* want to spend the day with their mother! You should probably have talked to your own kids too.\n\nAnd then you threw a little tantrum and destroyed the plans, still without consulting anyone.", "NAH.   You\u2019re NTA for not wanting to spend Mother\u2019s Day with 8 kids and wanting a break.   Your stepkids mom is NTA for wanting the day off on Mothers Day.   And your husband is NTA for feeling hurt that you don\u2019t want to spend the day with his kids.   But info needed\u2026 does your husband now have to watch your 4 kids because you are working?  That sounds like a lot to handle, and if that\u2019s the case you probably shouldn\u2019t have offered to cover the shift.", "Why aren't they with their mama?", "NTA and tell him your Mothers Day should be HIM taking care of his kids.  He is using you", "NTA. \nI would have just told him I ended up having to cover someone else's shift without mentioning why and just taken another day to myself. \nI'm not sure why the step kids mom doesn't want her own kids with her that day either. She IS their mother, after all.", "Info - I\u2019ll admit, your tone rubs me the wrong way but I think you need to explain more. \n\n- why are the kids coming over, is it part of an existing custody arrangement? \n- do you typically have the step kids on the weekend?\n- what will your husband be doing that day?", "The step kids have a bio mother, sounds like they are being dumped so\n bio mom can have the day to herself. And evidently, the step kids are w/stepmom every other weekend. Wouldn't  you expect the bio mom would want her kids on Mother's  Day?  And taking care of  6 kids is not a celebration for Mom. Where's the biomom???", "YTA\n\nIf you didn't want to consider his kids as your kids,  then you shouldn't have married him. \n\n>It's not that I dislike my sks \n\nIt sure looks that way.  Poor kids.  This was not about you generously allowing  their mother to have them, it was about you wanting rid of them for the day.", "Ugh, ESH. Do none of the adults communicate?\n\nThere is no prescribed rule for what is done on Mother's  Day.  The adults need to discuss it, like, you know, adults.  \n\nInstead, all 3 of you are just making assumptions and taking offense. Frankly, you guys have way too many kids to operate on anything less than clear communication. \n\nFWIW, I wouldn't want to spend Mother's Day taking 7 kids out to eat by myself either.  Your hubby needs to take the day off and take all of the kids, in my opinion.  \n\nYou do sound like you resent your stepkids in your post.  I think it's possible that you don't resent them so much as you are tired of being the sole caregiver for so many kids during the majority of their waking hours if the only days you have the stepkids are also days your hubby works all day til dinner time or later.  They get what, like 5 hours awake with him a week?  Seems like a more equitable split should be considered. But don't take frustration out on the kids, who had no say in any of this.", "So to be clear:\n\nHe lives with YOUR 3 kids full-time, but it sounds like you get tired of HIS kids visiting on weekends? (To be candid, that IS a lot of kids in the house)\n\nAnd why would your budget triple on Mother's Day? Your husband doesn't arrange the celebration? Tell him to step up. You're supposed to relax, he does the work on Mother's Day.", "ESH\n\nYou should have told your husband what your plans were and how you felt it made sense for your step kids to be with their bio mom on Mother\u2019s Day. He told you in advance that they wouldn\u2019t be spending the day with their bio mom, so some change to the plan needs to happen.\n\nAlso, I feel bad for your step kids because for some reason their bio mom isn\u2019t spending mother\u2019s day with them.\n\nAdding 4 children to a plan you already had is a bit much. If your husband is willing to go with you to watch over your step kids, that could work. Some sort of compromise should be made, but him just expecting to take your step kids with you and not go to help you out with them is ridiculous.\n\nMaybe cancel your original plan for now and reschedule it on another day. It won\u2019t be Mother\u2019s Day, but it could still be a fun outing to have.", "NTA but this isn\u2019t how a healthy blended family works. Your husband needs to communicate better when it comes to the children and you both need to work together to make these kind of days run smoothly.", "NTA. Most people do want to just relax on mother's day. Am I reading this correctly? It's a total of 8 kids? This is quite alot to handle.", "ESH \n\nYou and your husband need to communicate more clearly with each other. Why would you plan the day without talking to him about where his kids are going to be? Then on his part, why didn't he tell you all the kids will be with you and him on that day earlier? Then you said \"he must not have sensed my feeling\"... communicate, stop expecting him to read your mind. Then you passive aggressively told him you're just going to go to work on that day, instead of explaining to him about you feeling like you have to do all the work of caring for 8 kids instead of having a day that's about you.", "NTA. Emotional drama and exhaustion vs earning some money to spend on things I want to do with my family? That\u2019s an easy choice.", "There is alot of heat on bio mom for not wanting to spend mothers day with them.  \n\nWhen I was married to the biodad I looked forward to mothers day because that was the one day a year where my ex would take him to do things and I had time to myself.  \n\nEven now it can get that way sometimes (not near as much because we have 50/50) but dayum that was a nice change.  No spouse to take care of, no kids to take care of.... a just me day...", "ESH. You should've told hubby you wanted the day with just your kids, but he's to blame too because it seems like he sprang it on you at rhe last minute without consulting you. Also, why would his ex *not* want to spend Mother's Day with her own children? Right with you on that one. Mother's Day is about the mothers.", "ESH (op because you need to work on communication a bit) but I don\u2019t understand all of these comments \u2026 sometimes I don\u2019t even want my bio kids one day out of an occasional weekend. She already had plans \u2014 it\u2019s okay to want to stick with those plans. It\u2019s okay to want to spend one on one time with the kids she birthed for one day. It\u2019s okay not to want to spend the extra money on this one day. It\u2019s okay if she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with ANY of the kids on that one day. It\u2019s supposed to be a day about her and sometimes moms need a break too.", "NTA for the question you asked.  But if you have these kids every weekend, and you have never made a Mother\u2019s Day exception in the past, then why did you presume it would happen this time?\n\nYour husband needs to be asking you a month out how you want the day to go.  This makes me wonder if he did what his ex wanted as the easy way out, instead of running it by you first.  Sorry your day is going to be stressful.  Spend it how you want, including working if you want.", "ESH. You and Bio Mom can't have a cup of coffee and explain to your spouse that for mothers day y'all want a no kids day? Thats a fare position to take but you got to just say it.", "I understand your feelings.  I would like to point out that you were perfectly happy to spend the day at home as long as it was only with your kids.  Once his were in the picture you decided to go to work.  How exactly is he supposed to not take that personally or at least feel troubled by it?  if you wanted a relax day you should just request a day to yourself.  I don't fault you for how you feel, I've just been on your husband's side of things and know how that can feel as well.  NAH.\n\nEdit:  After reading through the comments and seeing how many times you say \"they aren't my kids\" I'm going to change to YTA.  It's tough to tell how strongly you feel the way you feel but I can' definitely tell you that your husband's resentment looks like it's a direct result of your deliberate indifference to his kids.  I'm a step-dad.  I don't ever feel like you do.  My steps end their phone calls with me with ILY (the girls do anyway) and they know how I feel about them.  You don't have to feel the same about them that you do about your kids, but you should try your best to make your husband not feel like you feel bothered by their presence.\n\nYou could have just rolled with it and then approached your husband a couple days later with \"Hey, I was really hoping to spend Mother's Day relaxing and with ALL of the kids around it just didn't happen.  Can you give me a post Mother's Day free day sometime in the next week so I can ... blah blah blah\"  He can't and shouldn't feel bothered if you are talking about a break from ALL of the kids.  Just saying.", "YTA\n\nDon't marry someone with kids if you're going to regard those kids as a burden.", "ESH. you said that your stepkids are with you on the weekends, you all could\u2019ve probably came up with a simple solution, like mothers day weekend the stepkids couldve just gone with there mom instead of with you guys and your husband shouldnt just dump all of the kids on you when you want to relax. HOWEVER, this is coming from someone who has a step parent, I would be pretty upset if It seemed like my stepmom didnt want to be around me, I think you handled the situation wrong bc you were probably frustrated but you can still turn it around.", "NTA. Why aren\u2019t your stepkids going to be with their mom that day?", "NTA. When I got divorced we went to trial. The judge was going over holidays and when she got to Mother\u2019s Day I said that I\u2019d prefer they go with my ex all day.\n\nAt the time he only had them 6 nights a month. He complained to the judge that I should have them for Mother\u2019s Day. The judge agreed that he should have them all day. \ud83d\ude02\n\nBest mothers days ever the past couple years. No stress. No having to go out to eat. I just got to relax. Enjoy your day. \n\nAlso, why wouldn\u2019t the kids be with their mom on Mother\u2019s Day? Maybe your husband should take all the kids to do something and you both get the day off.", "I'm going to go against the grain and say NTA. You have his kids every weekend despite him working weekends. Your stepkids mum gets to have a nice break every weekend and clearly doesn't want to see her own kids on mother's day but everyone is giving you hassle? \n\nI think you need to sit down with your husband and tell him to rework his custody arrangement so he only has the kids when he is not working. For mothers day if his ex doesn't want to see her own kids then he needs to entertain then, it's not crazy for you to want one on one time with your kids for one weekend.", "Yup YTA\n\nYou made a lot of assumptions and then threw your toys out of the pram when they turned out to be wrong. \n\nWhen you married their father you took on a mother's role, even if they still have their bio mum, YOU are still their stepmother. \n\nShouldn't have married him if your weren't willing to love them better than this.", "YTA what a way to make his kids feel like you don't like or care about them. You've also punished your own children as well as they can't spend time with you either. \n\nAnd oh no he sees his children EVERY weekend! He sounds like a good father. You are married and his children are part of the deal.", "YTA. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to relax that day \u2026\u201d - if my step kids come along. \n\n\u201cI would just like a break ..\u201d - from the step kids. I had plans to spend a whole day doing activities with MY kids.\n\n\u201cCovering another mother\u2019s shift for Mother\u2019s day ..\u201d - because \u201cthose kids are not my kids\u201d. \n\nNow that I\u2019m not getting what I want, which is a Mother\u2019s Day with only MY kids, I\u2019m going to just go to work and blame it all on my husband overreacting to me being an AH to \u201chis\u201d kids. And I don\u2019t hate my step kids, I just don\u2019t want them around.", "YTA, you sure sound like you don\u2019t like your step kids, and your husband absolutely should take that personally and maybe even reevaluate your relationship - I certainly would if my partner had your attitude about my kids.", "YTA. You just made it abundantly clear where his kids stand with you!", "YTA. I\u2019m not even going to get into how rude it is to only want to spend time with some of your children on Mother\u2019s Day. But if you\u2019d wanted to, you could have actually made a plan to do that and you couldn\u2019t even be bothered to coordinate one. Why on earth would you make your own plans for the day without having a single conversation with anyone else about them until the night before? Why just assume that your step kids wouldn\u2019t be around without actually asking anyone? Just because it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day doesn\u2019t mean you get to do whatever the hell you want without even telling the rest of your family.", "ESH. You're TA for not communicating, making assumptions, and then being all passive aggressive when your husband and/or his ex make different assumptions. Husband is TA for acting like an AH.", "YTA, it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day not your birthday.", "ESH i feel like we are missing why their mom doesn\u2019t want her kids on Mother\u2019s Day?  But truthfully the hubby just assumed you\u2019d like the opportunity to be with all the kids and was wrong which understandably is insulting. You wanted a less stressful Mother\u2019s Day which is also understandable. However neither of you is doing any understanding for each other which is after all a key ingredient to relationships. What I really want to know is how are the kids feeling about all this? That\u2019s what you all should be focused on here bc being that young, Mother\u2019s Day matters to them more than it might in the later years.", "Nta he is an so is their mother, its your choice to do what you want to do on your day. He is just upset because he will have to watch them", "YTA  \n\n\ndo not marry someone with kids if you are unwilling to see them as yours.  \n\n\nyou could have chosen someone without kids and you would not be in this situation", "NAH - but you positioned it and handled it poorly.  And let me say, that's a strange time-sharing arrangement to have the step-kids EVERY weekend.  I mean, their mom never gets a weekend during the school year??  But you're saying that you need a break from his kids, which isn't cool.\n\nAt any rate, I'd ask the kids if they want to spend some time with their mom on Mother's day, maybe they head back mid-afternoon on Sunday?  You need to fix this with your husband though.  You are a mother figure to your step-kids, you are their step-MOTHER.  It's 100% appropriate that they spend at least part of the day with you.  Maybe do breakfast or brunch with everyone and then they can head back to have a special dinner with their mom.", "NTA \n\nHis kids should be with their mother. You should have your kids. Lol. Simple \n\nI\u2019m sorry he basically made you work for Mother\u2019s Day rather than spending it with the people who made you a mother.", "NTA, that's a lot on you for mother's day. Don't listen to the haters. You make perfect sense to me. Let your husband have all the children you do something for yourself", "NTA\n\nAnd I\u2019m surprised at all the YTA. Seriously? Mothers day is not about what your kids/stepkids or your husband wants to do. Fathers day is next month to satisfy his wishes. \nYou should be able to spend mothers day as YOU want. Your kids or no kids. Their mother get to be carefree while you have double duty? How is that fair? And u have em EVERY weekend? NAH. Why do husbands think that we want to be around them and kids on Mother\u2019s Day like its a treat? Its really a regular day with more work while dressed up and being handed a flower.  \nStand your ground and go to work.
