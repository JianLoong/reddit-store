We study architecture and we are in our last year 4th year. The first assignment was made on time by me and Elias. Yonah handed it in later with Milo and Yonah had a good piece but Milo had made it in literally 15 minutes and it was full of crap. When we asked Milo to fix it he did not do it and started a fight with me saying that I am just being annoying. After that he said he would make a design of the house we are working on. We said ok and 1 week passes he didn't start. Second week he does not attend class because he is sick third week again he is sick and hasn't started yet. \n\nI don't believe he is sick. Ok yes he had a minor accident but it was so minor even the doctor said it. I think he is just using it as an excuse to skip school and normally I wouldn't care but him not even participating with the project and not helping out is just annoying. Mind you in the period of 2,5 weeks where he was \"sick\"  he went to the movies went to a theme park went to work and has gamed every day for hours. So we tried calling him last lesson of project and he told us \"F OFF I AM FING SICK\". \n\nTogether with the rest of the group we decided we would make the design of the house and we put everything in our end essay. We all got a 7 out of 10 but Milo got a 4 out of 10. And to pass the school year you needed at least 6 out of 10. Also Milo was in our class on conditions and the conditions were that he needed to pass his projects and be present. Well he failed both and that means that not only did he not pass his last year he is going back to the 3rd year.\n\nMilo is furious and said that he didn't pass because of us and that we shouldn't have put that stuff in the end essay. He said that now because of us he is not going to pass and he resents us. I am wondering did I go too far? Should I just have written that the teamwork was ok and we all participated?

We decided to continue ourselves without him made the design and we put everything that happened with him in the end essay. He failed the class because of it and now is going back to his 3rd year.

I've kicked people out of groups for less that what Milo has  done.

Which is it?\n\nNTA either way, if he\u2019s unable to fulfill obligations due to mild disability then he is responsible for asking for extra accommodations.", "Info: how does failing 4th year mean that he needs to go back and repeat 3rd year? \n\nAlso where does the school year end in September?", "NTA but did you ask the rest of the group how they felt about you putting it in the essay or was it a group effort?", "Definitely NTA. He figured it would get done and he'd just take the credit.  Life doesn't work that way. Either do the work or loose the job ect. He needs to learn that. It's not right to take credit for others hard work. He got plenty of chances. He got what he deserved.", "NTA his own actions caused him to fail", "NTA - You and your friends did not cause him to fail. He caused HIMSELF to fail.\n\nhe was lazy, he expected other to do his work, he showed an ongoing pattern of being entitled and not doing his share.\n\nHe EARNED his grade. He doesn't have the right to be angry that everyone didn't cater to him like a tiny helpless child. You did the work, he could have too. He CHOSE not to.", "Nta. Happened to Me, where my classmate thought he could get away with ignoring us for 3 months, and then intimidate us into putting his name down on the project.\n\nWe had to score by %, up to a 100, on how much effort a member was putting in. Eg: if we score the classmate at 50%, and get a grade 60/100, classmate gets 30/100.\n\nOn the day of assessment, guy strolls in and has no idea what the project even is, but is the first one to write 100% on the paper. I told him \"no - I don't even remember you name\". He proceeds to get intimidating (failing at that), and complains to the teacher, who is observing this whole ordeal, laughing, as he didn't know the guy's name either.\n\nAfter getting tired of the nonsense, I told him I would give him 50% (our group agreed to let me deal with it), and for every word he says, I'm knocking him down 5%.\n\nWe got down to -40% before he started trying to fight me, and was laughed out of the class.\n\nHe dropped out after that day.
