Aside from the illegality, you need them. And if you try and refill the prescription too soon your doctor won't prescribe it to you anymore.", "NTA\n\nYou needed to be blunt or she'd still be asking.\n\nJust guard your pills well around her.", "NTA\n\nThis is medication you need to function and she wants it for recreational purposes. She can be offended all she wants, but you don't have to give her anything. Plus, it's also a bit of tough love by pointing out how close she was/is to ruining her life with drugs in the first place.", "NTA. Blunt helps avoid misunderstandings and future requests. Additionally perhaps you provided a lightbulb moment to your friend about the potential implications of their request.", "NTA. Truth hurts, but still needs to be spoken.", "NTA. You shouldn't enable your friend and like you said it's illegal. \nMaybe in the future you don't need to tell everybody you have a prescription for a controlled two substance. Especially your friend that struggles with dependence issues. It would eliminate a lot of stress for everyone.", "NTA like at all. Someone had to be blunt with her as clearly the criminal justice system wasn\u2019t obvious enough, (irrespective of my own feelings on weed, repeatedly getting yourself into easily avoidable trouble makes no sense)", "NTA I think your remarks were a reality check that\u2019s called for. And as others have pointed out, giving in to her demands would be illegal and also cause you to run short of necessary medication. Going back for a refill too soon would likely result in your doctor cutting you off. Keep your pills locked up or hidden in a very secure place at all times.", "You're NTA for the tough love, nor for refusing to commit a crime for her. Morally and socially, you're completely in the clear", "Would have been better to go with a less intense way of refusing. Could have merely pointed out that this is medicine that you need. Not something to be shared. I'm going back and forth between NTA and a mild YTA. Ultimately, not a terrible thing to say but unnecessary in the circumstances.", "NTA but you should probably still apologize if you want to remain friends. People with drug issues can still have their feelings hurt.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your friend that was there when you said it is the enabler and needs to be put in check as well.", "If at all, only slightly. It was certainly blunt, especially since they Drug use Was never with that form of drug. Jumping directly to, \"they are ruining their life with this drug\" Instead of asking why they wanted it is probably the only thing you did wrong.\n\nFor all we know, they have or was recently diagnosed with ADHD or something similar, They never told you, and wanted to see if it would help her before getting her own prescription. since it can be pricey to get a Prescription drug without insurance (Sometimes, depends on a lot of factors like where you live, whether they has insurance, ETC ETC...)\n\nTL;DR NTA for the most part. If anything, the only thing you did wrong was not asking WHY they wanted the pill, and instead jumped directly to drug abuse.", "NTA.  She asked once and you said no.  She asked again and you gave her your reason.   She wants your controlled substances and doesn\u2019t care how you feel about not sharing.", "NTA. She is asking you to do something illegal. Sounds like she needs a wake up call. I think weed should be legal everywhere. But you have to follow the laws of your country or pay the price.", "YTA. The situation could easily have been avoided if you kept your medication status to yourself. I certainly avoid telling people (except for few exceptions) I have and/or am taking a controlled substance precisely for avoiding this type of interaction. \n\nOn top of that, misdemeanor possession charges for weed is pretty far from \u201cruining their life\u201d. They may want to move to a state where that is legal to avoid further trouble, but it\u2019s probably the lowest concern I would have with a friend who uses drugs. \n\nIt seems like your prejudice against drug users made your response unintentionally harsh and the situation was brought up by you being more open about your own drug use (legal or otherwise) than would be advisable.", "NTA but you\u2019re so blunt you don\u2019t sound like friends at all. If you don\u2019t like this person, why hang around them? \n\nAlso, hide your meds and don\u2019t talk about your prescription, it\u2019s no one\u2019s business but yours.", "Yeah, I don't think she would steal one, but that's good advice. Fortunately, I keep them at home, take one daily in the morning, and don't carry them with me. So she wouldn't really have the opportunity.  But, in any case, she isn't like a hardcore destructive addict or anything. She holds down a couple of jobs and maintains a life and relationships.", "Yeah, I didn't think that through. I and another friend were just talking about what was going on in our lives, like, \"So, how was your week?\" And I could have been a bit more discreet.", "This. What OP did is called tough love for a reason. It is love, they said this because they don't want to hurt their friend. But it is tough.", "Yeah, that's fair.", "Also it doesn't sound like the friend necessarily has a drug problem if they've been found with weed twice in a county that seems to be notorious for prosecuting. It's a drug that is fully legal in many states at this point and acting like it's a hard substance could be the reason the friend is more.upset. just because something is illegal does not absolutely always make it morally wrong", "That's fair. I was trying to be concise, but her reasoning was that she was working a double and hadn't slept well the previous night. She really just wanted it for the amphetamine qualities. At least, that's what she told me.", "It wasn't prejudice, it was the fact that she very nearly ruined her life. If she had been sentenced to fulfill her sentence in jail, she would have gotten evicted, all her stuff would have gone to the curb, her car would have been towed away, and she would have lost her jobs. The charge on her record was the least of her concerns.", "She's a good person, and a good friend. And, normally, it wouldn't matter that she smokes weed once in awhile. (Hell, as much as I drink, I certainly live in a glass house on that issue.) But she had a run of bad luck, as I mentioned, getting arrested in a county where they actually care about that.", "I mean, she got caught with pot a second time knowing that she might get jail time for it. How is that not destructive?", "I'd put your meds in a new container and fill the med bottle with laxatives. If someone wants to fuck around a find out, let them learn a lesson", "Sorry, I didn't mean it as a criticism just a suggestion. I overshared a lot when I was younger and in retrospect things would have been simpler if I didn't.", "Then No. NTA. 100%", "\u201cHad of run of bad luck.\u201d Vs \u201cYou\u2019re ruining life and I\u2019m not going to help you.\u201d \n\nWhich is it? \n\nUltimately, you don\u2019t/shouldn\u2019t give your meds to someone, but a simple, \u201cNo.\u201d when she asked is also a complete sentence that holds no judgement.", "No, no offense taken. You\u2019re absolutely right. It probably would be wise to keep this to myself, given the apparent demand for Adderall.", "Her bad luck was getting caught somewhere where weed was a problem. In the county we live in, the prosecutor isn't even pursuing simple possession cases any more. She got arrested in a different, much more \"yee-haw\" county where they take it seriously.\n\nThe part where she nearly ruined her life was smoking pot in that county, and then smoking pot again while she was on probation."]}
