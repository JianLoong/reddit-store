The situation could easily have been avoided if you kept your medication status to yourself. I certainly avoid telling people (except for few exceptions) I have and/or am taking a controlled substance precisely for avoiding this type of interaction. \n\nOn top of that, misdemeanor possession charges for weed is pretty far from \u201cruining their life\u201d. They may want to move to a state where that is legal to avoid further trouble, but it\u2019s probably the lowest concern I would have with a friend who uses drugs. \n\nIt seems like your prejudice against drug users made your response unintentionally harsh and the situation was brought up by you being more open about your own drug use (legal or otherwise) than would be advisable.", "NTA but you\u2019re so blunt you don\u2019t sound like friends at all.

I was trying to be concise, but her reasoning was that she was working a double and hadn't slept well the previous night. She really just wanted it for the amphetamine qualities. At least, that's what she told me.", "It wasn't prejudice, it was the fact that she very nearly ruined her life.

You\u2019re absolutely right. It probably would be wise to keep this to myself, given the apparent demand for Adderall.", "Her bad luck was getting caught somewhere where weed was a problem. In the county we live in, the prosecutor isn't even pursuing simple possession cases any more.

Like you said it\u2019s a controlled substance that you have an rx for and that is given to treat a specific medical condition. \nLike other commenters said if you shared that drug there could be huge consequences for you. \nYou were blunt with your friend but that\u2019s what needed to be done.

You can't share medication because it's illegal, and because it's something you need to treat your disorder.

She NEEDED to hear that, that's why she's so offended.  The truth hurts.", "NTA. Expecting someone to share their MEDICATION with you is fucked up!", "NTA. You were a bit harsh perhaps, but sometimes as a friend you have to lay it out clearly and bluntly- especially when that person isn\u2019t getting how serious something is. A lot of states are EXTREMELY harsh about this sort of thing. Word of advice about the adderall- keep it locked up and/or stored discreetly. I was prescribed it years ago and also had friends ask for them. I\u2019ve also had multiple pills go \u201cmissing\u201d from the bottle with of course no one owning up to it. Don\u2019t put it in a general medicine cabinet, definitely don\u2019t leave it laying around on a dresser or counter, if you carry a purse put it in an inside zip pocket that is hard to see or get to. Personally what I started doing is taking the majority of them and putting them in a generic vitamin bottle, and then only using the actual script bottle if I had to take some somewhere with me (so I wouldn\u2019t get in trouble if I got pulled over etc). I would only carry what I needed in the bottle though. Everything else stayed in the generic vitamin bottle at home that I had stored with my other vitamins. This was years ago when I had roommates and a lot of random people constantly in my home though. Thankfully now I don\u2019t ever need to worry about this, but at the time it eliminated a lot of stress and paranoia.", "NTA.  The pot stuff is irrelevant.  You don\u2019t give away your prescription drugs just because someone wants one.", "NTA and I would not be kind to anyone asking me for my Adderall. First of all, I need those to function like a human and not an angry goblin. Second of all, you're the reason I gave to go through so much bs to even be able to take them to begin with! \n\nSo, no! I'd eat an extra one in front of you just to be petty, but unlike you, I actually need these so it would just hurt me in the end.", "NTA but your friend is the AH for asking you for a prescription drug assigned to you and getting pissy when you said no.

I use the present tense because he will ALWAYS be a pill addict. If pills are out he will take them. So you have to be BLUNT. When I gave birth my husband told me I need to hide my pills, he will not go searching for them, but if they are out he knows he will take 1. That was OUR plan and we stuck to it.

She asked once and you said no without any lecture, but she chose to try again.  At that point you have to nip it in the bud or she will never stop asking.\n\nNTA", "Not a friend. She is using you. NTA", "Shit like this is why some docs require urine tests when they prescribe adderall - so that they can confirm you're taking it instead of selling it. \n\nShit like this is why those of us who need this stuff to function have to jump through eighty godsdamn flaming hoops to get a prescription if we switch doctors or move out of state. \n\nI get pissed as hell at people who take it because they think it's fun or whatever and think that's what it does for everyone, when **I need it to drive, think, and work like a neurotypical person**. Her friend asking means her friend absolutely does not understand what it's like to have ADHD, and thinks that OP is using adderall for funsies, and that alone would make me bust into a long lecture and/or unfriending. It is hard enough being diagnosed with ADHD as an adult without people trying to fucking beg, borrow, or steal your meds *that you actually need to function*.", "Yup - and I don't think she was too harsh with friend. She asked after she was told NO. Friend probably needed to hear it. NTA", "Yes she is, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have gotten arrested for marijuana while she was still on probation.", "You never know what people are capable of especially if they are desperate enough.\n\nNTA", "That's why we have coffee and other caffeine drinks - which are legal.", "My personal history with the addicts in my life have me strongly doubting she was actually(or only)busted for weed. Maybe someone along the way went easier on her by it being the only substance cited or OP and mutuals never saw any formal paperwork with charges. I\u2019m not doubting that some areas are this strict on it, I\u2019ve just been burnt believing BS from people in active addiction so many times.", "The issue isn't whether or not pot is okay, it's whether the consequences of using pot in that jurisdiction are going to have a serious negative impact on her life. OP didn't judge her for using pot, but she said she wasn't going to help her continue to make stupid, potentially future-damaging choices (that happen to be drug-related, so there could be an added dimension to the issue). From that perspective I think OP's bluntness was the honest response if a caring and concerned friend.", "NTA for being blunt.  She does seem determined to screw up her life. You don\u2019t need to help her with that.", "Being a good friend doesnt mean supporting her while she does stupid shit. It means telling her shes doing stupid shit and that you wont help.\n\nYou are a good friend. Hopefully she hears the wake up call.\n\nBut tbh, Ive been you in similar situations and its absolutely lost me friends who wanted a \"yes man\" and got my actual opinion along with my offer to support them in making good choices.", "Lmao NTA she needs help\n\nAlso how did she find out you\u2019re taking it?", "NTA - I have many friends in recovery for different past addictions and they are the first ones to speak up and tell someone that they have never said \u201cThanks so much for enabling my bad behavior\u2026\u201d it\u2019s always been \u201cThanks so much for cutting me off and kicking me out of the house for my bad behavior so that I could see for myself I have a problem and need to get help\u201d Sometimes a person needs to hear the blunt words and not the sugarcoated ones. She took offense that you aren\u2019t willing to help her continue her current behavior.", "NTA. Maybe it\u2019s time people stop \u201dsugarcoating\u201c things for her and what you stated was the truth - she\u2019s lucky she\u2019s got out of trouble so far and if she has to take drug tests for her probation, she can be in violation if she tests for a drug she doesn\u2019t have a prescription for (I believe some ADHD meds can show up on drug screens but I maybe wrong).", "NTA\n\nLol. Why on earth would you tiptoe around when an apparent druggie (if she keeps taking drugs despite the legal consequences, she lacks control over her habit) asks if you can spare the a pill or two?\n\nGiven the circumstances, bluntness is needed.", "When I fractured my tibial plateau the urgent care doctor misread my x-ray and even though I literally screamed in pain when I was getting the x-rays they sent me home with ibuprofen. Later that day they called and told me the radiologist found a fracture and prescribed some pain meds. It was crazy.", "I held down a job, family, and had wonderful relationships when I was actively stealing pills from everyone.  If the natural consequences of substance abuse don\u2019t stop someone from using, there may be a problem.  Don\u2019t discount how manipulative addicts can be.", "NTA and the end of the day you don\u2019t feel comfortable giving your meds to a friend so don\u2019t.  Regardless of her past, they\u2019re yours.  Saying no the first time should have been enough.", "NTA.. you said no twice and she didn't listen. She is the AH. You found a way for her to hear \"no\"", "I take Adderall and the minute anyone asked me for one I'd quit speaking to them. You didn't overreact at all.", "YTA for being judgmental about cannabis related law issues, since it's absolutely nonsense that cannabis is illegal at all. The illegality of cannabis is simply the product of the US govts greed & inability to control the growth, sale & taxing of it. And the PR campaign against it was untrue & racist. \n\nAdderall is way more dangerous than cannabis is. What with its chemical composition being basically meth. \n\nThat said- don't give ppl your meds. Not wrong for that.", "YTA \nop asked if they were the AH for their words, not for keeping them from her. clearly ur friend is going thru a hard time and judgement is the last thing she needs. u should have been compassionate and told her that u are worried about her health and safety. i understand being frustrated and wanting to be firm but u can be firm and upset while still speaking with kindness. \n\napologize for what u said and how, but explain why u said it and how u care about her - otherwise it seems like ur just annoyed about her addiction and dont give a shit.\n\nher asking for drugs is extrememly concerning - she needs a friend not a judge", "NTA. This was barely blunt given the spiral your friend is going on. Unfortunately, I expect she'll be in jail relatively soon.", "NTA you didn't do anything wrong refusing to give her drugs, you are 100% right you aren't an AH for that.\n\nBut I don't think how you handled it was wrong either. She's been in trouble for drugs before, maybe some people dont think weed is a big deal, but it's illegal where you are and if she is asking for other drugs then I would say she has an issue. You told it to her straight but you weren't rude or nasty. She knew it's illegal for you to give her your prescription drugs, but she asked you anyway. That alone is screwed up.", "NTA.", "YTA. I doubt that if one of your \u201cresponsible\u201d friends had asked you would have given them anything either\u2026 so at the end of the day, the probation is not the most important factor in your decision. In light of that your rant was unnecessary and judgmental.\n\nIf you wanted to have a productive and honest conversation with your friend about her drug use there\u2019s a time and place for that, and words you can use to get your point across, but this wasn\u2019t it.", "NTA. You told her what she needed to hear. That doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s going to like it. Substance abusers typically don\u2019t.", "NTA  \n\nSometimes, if you really are a friend,  you need to be blunt.  Her problems are starting to have an effect on you, so much so you all have emergency plans for her stuff should she go to jail.  She is also drug seeking from friends as I'm sure you are not the first friend she's asked to share a script with.", "Addicts don't start as hard core addicts. I work with addicts and she is well on that road, she has an issue. And honestly you'd be shocked at how fast things change. I really do think you need to guard your meds if she ever does come over, lock them away and don't let her around them. She will try to take them because not only does she have an issue but she doesn't seem to see what's wrong with this situation so she may feel entitled or that you're being a prude.\n\nDo not trust her, you could be that one that suffers.", "So, you were too blunt and SHE was offended? She asked you to share your prescription twice. She\u2019s TA.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA.", "You\u2019re not an asshole, but if you value your friendship greatly I would follow up and voice your concerns. No addict likes to be looked down upon, but she does need to understand that she\u2019s playing with fire. Addictive behaviors are just that, regardless of the specific habit, and they\u2019ll land you in trouble if you don\u2019t keep them in check.\n\nIt is monumentally stupid for her to ask. Amphetamines are no joke."]}
