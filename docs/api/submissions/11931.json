Other women teaching little girls their 'place in this world' (like your husband has insisted) is a really big problem.

She doesn\u2019t need to learn how to appease other people. Id also reconsider the play dynamic with the two children if the boy\u2019s parents aren\u2019t on the same page. Put up all the boundaries. Dad needs counseling.", "This! My stepdaughter is also barely a teen and in middle school and struggles with a lot of jealousy, especially with other women. A lot of it stems from her bio mom who is the same way. In her mom\u2019s eyes, not even my stepdaughter is worthy of praise and mom is very jealous of her daughter. \n\nMy partner and I are super close. I\u2019m very secure in our relationship and we bring up past experiences a lot- they make us who we are. His ex girlfriend, the one right before me, had my dream car when they were dating. We had passed one at a car dealership once, I mentioned I always wanfed one, he said his ex had one and they were really awesome to drive and we had a short conversation about the car. \n\nMy stepdaughter was absolutely appalled. She was so mad at him for talking about his ex girlfriend in front of me and she was mad at me for not being mad at him! I explained to her that I\u2019m not jealous of his ex girlfriend. He tells me about experiences he had in all his past relationships and I do the same- it really helps when dealing with arguments because now we know why each other react to certain situations the way they do. I know he loves me and that he\u2019s not going anywhere. Then I make a joke of it and tell her that I\u2019m not lucky enough for him to leave me LOL. She asked why he would rub it in my face that his ex girlfriend has the car I\u2019ve always wanted and I explained that\u2019s not what he was doing. He was just sharing his experience. Besides, the car is stupid expensive for no reason (but good for her for being able to afford it- go girl) And it doesn\u2019t fit in our lifestyle. We have a family and want more kids and that car will never work for us. Doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t dream!", "We have no idea what Lucas' parents have done, besides allowing him not to go to OP's house.\n\nIt's just a great opportunity for both sets of parents to educate their child on emotions and relations. Not taking it is definitely a disservice to either kid.", ">this strikes me as a man who will shame her in the future for how she dresses, telling her she\u2019s inviting any harassment she gets etc. \n\nExactly. What if she runs into a Nice Guy who throws a fit when she starts dating someone else?  I was pressured into dating a Nice Guy sophomore year before I even knew the term, and it was confusing as hell. Luckily my mom & sister HATED him, so I had support through the eventual breakup and his tantrum/stalking when I started dating a mutual friend. \n\nIf my dad was telling me \"He brought you roses every Monday, why would you want to leave him?\" it would've been a nightmare.\n\nAlso, high school is full of bad decisions. What if she actually did cheat on someone? What would her dad's reaction be?", "I totally agree with you. I found the posting and comments kinda disturbing. These are 7 year old children who are friends.  Why push this boyfriend girlfriend dynamic on 7 year old children, very strange to me. They are children, let them be be children.\nThe father, yikes, scary and disturbing.", "Haha, I honestly think there are several people I technically was dating that I never officially broke up with in high school....they or I moved and we just kinda stopped talking. Not the best at conflict and we knew we weren't getting married or anything, so...", "Yep, I had five boyfriends at this age. Never officially broke up with any of them. I've been married for 13 years now. My poor husband...I don't know how to break this to him.", "Lol Same here. I have been married to multiple husbands -some at the same time gasp! Because when I was about seven I got married to about half of my friends.", "Haha, me too! I was 5 when we got married with a chuck e cheese prize ring, and 6 when they moved out of state. It was tragic. I swore I'd grow up and find him and we'd marry our friend Amanda and live happily ever after, eating Mac and cheese and cookies in our treehouse. \n\nIf anyone out there knows Chris, I cherished our time together in practical life play and in that chuck e cheese ball pit. I'm sorry we're both living in sin as I got married,  but not to Amanda,  so I guess I'm a big bigamist, cheater, and liar...", "Mind you, probably best the father takes a hands off approach at this point given he is projecting adult relationships onto a seven year old.", "For once I'm glad a dude said that. I am afraid of what he would do to the daughter if he is so upset about it.", "Why not both?", "I would definitely suggest that she does both. This can be an important lesson for Layla about the feelings of others which is so important as she develops her own understanding of empathy and the consequences of her behaviors. On the other hand, it's also extremely important that OP talks to her husband to ask why he seems to be so triggered by the situation. OP better handle this now and put the husband in check before Layla is a teen and is navigating more serious relationships.", "I think it screams toxic masculinity! He wouldn\u2019t give his son this talk or punishments, I would put money on it!", "I've known plenty of 7 y/o that get mad when their friends play with new people. It usually happens to kids a bit younger, but center-of-the-world thinking hasn't completely dissipated by 7. (Possibly ever, as we all know, but it's still developmentally appropriate at 7.)\n\nI still hope Lucas is being reminded that people can have lots of friends.", "If Layla were Leo- it would be \u201cawe cute such a little flirt\u201d *gag*", "This! Why didn\u2019t his parents explain to him that he doesn\u2019t get to own the little girl and be upset that she has mother friend? His parents and her husband are all TA and need an adult to talk to them all about managing their big feelings at this impressionable age \ud83d\ude44", "My read of the folks who are saying that Layla should be made aware of Lucas' feelings in response to her actions are trying to educate her that actions have consequences. Here, she excluded a friend, the consequence of that is the friend is mad at her and canceled a play date. I don't think anybody is suggesting that Layla be made to feel *responsible* for lucas' feelings or that she needs to deal with/fix them for lucas. Rather, use this as a way of showing her that when you hurt people's feelings, sometimes they need space away from you, and that's totally OK. It could also be a time to discuss ways she can navigate relationships in the future if her intention wasn't to make Lucas feel excluded (she might be over Lucas, or Lucas did something to her, in which case her behavior of moving on is 100% appropriate).\n\nImo it's teaching empathy for Lucas, which is an important lesson ESPECIALLY for a 7 year old. First and second graders are still very much \"everything is about me\" and teaching consideration of other people is age appropriate.", "Seconded. That's excellent parenting. My parents were totally unapproachable, and the closest thing I ever got to advice about dating was my mother's insistence that sex was horrible and she didn't know why I'd want to \"subject myself\" to it. And then my dad jumped in to say, \"You liked it well enough before!\"\n\nSo yeah. That was really healthy relationship modelling.", "Clearly this other boy is just leading Layla on to get back at Lucas for some perceived wrong. Too late Layla will regret losing the wealthy and honorable Lucas. If only her mother had raised her right!", "I'm gonna go ahead and say I have you beat on embarrassing \"boyfriends\". Mine was a priest from my parish. No he didn't do anything to me. For whatever reason, I decided the older gentleman who was nice to me must be my boyfriend and then proceeded to run around telling everyone so. He was very nice and indulged my childish fantasy. \n\nBut boy am I embarrassed now!", "Except for X here is a 7 year old girl having other friendships which lead to Y her friend who happens to be a boy is feeling possessive and angry that Layla did not ask for his permission to have other friends. Is that a lesson you want to teach? Would you teach that same lesson if her friend was also a girl? Or would you tell her that people can have multiple friends which doesn\u2019t make them any less friends, and that one friend doesn\u2019t get to tell her who she can and can\u2019t be friends with? \n\nThey are children, they are not in a romantic relationship. This whole \u201ctalk to her about why is justified in feeling possessive and she should feel bad about it and comply\u201d is nonsense. You\u2019re agreeing with the husband that she is a cheater. She\u2019s 7.", "Ok yes I love this explanation - doesn\u2019t make her responsible for his feelings, but does help her understand what\u2019s going on. Taking notes bc my daughter is five, thanks!", "Yes that\u2019s true.", "Poor dog\u2026", "No, it hurts pretty damn bad when daddy does it, too but the rest of your point is spot on.", "Also I\u2019m sort of pleased that you misspelled \u201cpatriarchy.\u201d Joke\u2019s on them!!! XD", "I\u2019d say it\u2019s more of a MGTOW (Men Go Their Own Way) vibes than INCEL, as tmk INCELs aren\u2019t married. ALL of those Male Supremacist Groups are Horrendously Misogynistic & Toxic tho.", "Agreed", "I'm getting major idiot vibes, myself.", "While yes, 7 is too young to truly grasp the complicated feelings in relationships, I wouldn't discount that Lucas himself could have used the word 'cheating'. Kids these days tend to have way too much access to the internet and therefore content for older audiences. When my little cousins were 4 I heard them playing with Barbies and making up stories where Ken was cheating on Barbie by kissing other women while Barbie was pregnant with his baby, so Barbie had to divorce Ken and went to live with her best friend Elsa, who helped her raise the baby. Obviously they don't truly understand what they are saying, but they know the general vocabulary of relationship drama pretty early on.", "Agree, I think it's the grownups that are making this more grownups than it has to be.\n\nWhen my daughter was 3, she had a best friend (same age), a boy, and he was very \"possessive\" - like, he didn't like it when she played with other kids in Kindergarten. He was definitely jealous, but there was nothing romantic about it (no one called them boyfriend and girlfriend, they were friends, his parents are very progressive and kind, he often played very \"girly\" things with my daughter, so it was really just a case of him being 3 and having a best friend).", "It doesn't say that the other parents mentioned cheating at all, they said Lucas took offence and was upset. Only her husband said cheating.", "LOVE to have known whether those girls held a vote or Rock Paper Scissors?", "When I was a kid, the swings were my favorite. A bunch of my friends and I would race out to the playground so we could get on the swings first. I proudly told my parents that we were \"the swingers\".", "I love this! Reminds me of a 5 year old who would tell anyone who would listen that I was her best friend but she\u2019d be too shy to even talk to me when I saw her.", "I would have done the same. Its easy to tell mature adults that \u201chey I know its a little ehhh but Lucas is very sad and upset at Layla. Hes working through it but do not want to be around her at the moment. Im sorry but you now, KIDS.\u201d Then both parents know and can talk to both the children in the situation and hopefully once the parents explain TO BOTH KIDS, then they could continue this friendship.", ">patriachary\n\nAchary...archery, I mean anarchy is fun. If I were christian, this would a Jesus take the wheel moment.", "I wish there was a haha \ud83d\ude02 button.", "It's the magic of the riiiiiinnng\n\nhttps://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2009-07-02\n\nGood god 2009. I am ancient.", "That, and him pushing the responsibility on OP to address it. Why? Because she's female? Both parents raise the child, they share the responsibility in discussing it.", "I'm old and did not have access to the internet while playing with Barbies and I still had them cheat on each other and get pregnant with another Ken's baby. Just a dramatic kid that liked to tell dramatic stories. Still do.", "Marriage was never consummated.      So it was legal enough by middle school rules.", "Lol", "Thanks!", "I\u2019m not the one you asked, but I also grew up in purity culture and can say without a doubt that it absolutely fucked me up. It does so much more damage than I think people even realize. I have been married nearly 15 years and I\u2019m still not sure sex will ever be normalized in my mind.", "There is an episode of Into the Dark (on Hulu) called Pure that is a pretty frightening take on purity culture run amok.  \n\nI always want to believe that the people who take purity culture to extremes are few and far between, but sadly that\u2019s not necessarily the case.", "In British English infant is a child between the ages of about 4 and 8. I went to infant school at those ages.", "Thank you, I didn't know that! In the US (or at least my area of it) an infant is a baby who's not walking yet.", "Oh my goodness this was so civil and nice! Did I stumble onto a different internet?", "You\u2019ll also see \u201cinfant\u201d be used to refer to minors in legal textbooks, typically in much older cases. It makes sense now that I know that Britains use it for young children, because US law does refer back to England legal precedent. Very interesting stuff!"]}
