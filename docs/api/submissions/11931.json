You do educate them though.\nYou should be talking to her about how she should handle these situations, how it affects other people's emotions. What it means to be friends vs boyfriends.

You can bring to her attention that Lucas is upset, and why that may be, ask her how she'd felt if she saw him in the same situation etc. (and imo and important distinction to make is to understand that she didn't MAKE him upset, but that he reacted to her behaviour with being upset.

These kids are **seven years old**! There can be no cheating if the people involved are not in a committed relationship.  How stupid to suggest that these two little kids are in any way in that typed of relationship.  **They are friends.**\n\nBy my lights, to punish your daughter in this situation would be crazy and wrong. I would just talk to her in simple terms about trying not to hurt a friend's feelings.", "How would she even understand this punishment or talk? She\u2019s 7 not 17! Your husband is ridiculous to think that a young child will be able to process this information. Lol NTA", "NTA. Telling Layla that Lucas is upset because she played with someone else, that would be a good thing. Teaching empathy and that people exist when she is not there and all that.\n\nBut lecturing and punishing her for cheating? That implies a greater understanding of interpersonal relationships and her own feelings than any 7-year-old can be expected to have.

Like a real couple we didn't took a lot of interest in each other after the wedding though... on the other hand nico and me never said we are exclusive - what would have been dificult anyway bc the bride he married the day before was present at our wedding. When i think about it i guess he only wanted the better snacks, this little shit. I have to call his mom and tell her she should punish him. Lol", "NTA and faithfulness at 7, your husband seems to have his head so far up his ass that all he can see is sh\\*t. Don't push adult crap onto a child and all she is doing is enjoying holding hands with a friend or maybe someone she felt comfortable with at that time. Also how dare Lucas parents turn this shit on your family. If a 7 year old is this possessive then he's best left alone as your daughter will only end up getting hurt later on as he's most definitely someone I wouldn't want around my daughter. She's free to hold hands with whoever she wants to and faithfulness comes much later in life when they start realizing the meaning of the world. As of now they are kids and don't take the innocents of them and entrap them into a life of adult bs. Hope the young lady is keeping well and do look after her.", "NTA. I think you would be doing more harm than good explaining the concept of being faithful to your kid at this age. \nA boyfriend at 7 is not a sexual or very emotional thing, it's a play on actual relationships. The earliest a kid gets more or less a concept of what that topic is around the age of 10 (and even then very very marginally). \nJust let your kid play, maybe explain why Lucas could be upset in very childlike terms.

For holding hands? \n\nRidiculous \n\n\nNTA", "Nta.\nYou don't punish a 7 year old for having another lover but you can explain that some peopne are hurt when they have to \"share\" their lover and that she should talk to her lover, rxplai that she has another lovzr and see of they are okay with it....", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
