You have provided them support but they have not taken it upon themselves to not take advantage. Since they ignored you they have had their second chance. They are old enough and wise enough to stand on their own two feet. You don't say if you won the home or if you rent. You don't indicate if you can move or if there are reasons why you can't - so I won't say - just move... but be prepared for them to not leave when the time is up and so you must plan what your next step will be. There have been too many stories out there of not being able to get rid of people from your home once they get a foot in the door. You need to be prepared to do whatever you must to get them or you out.

Words are one thing, but when you serve them with actual, legal, paperwork they will get the idea.", "NTA they\u2019re blatantly taking advantage of them. It\u2019s their choice to do nothing with their lives they\u2019ve had more than an enough time to do literally anything. You need to kick them out or they\u2019ll never leave", "NTA, you are way more patient than I would have been. Why would they look for work when you are enabling them just to do what they want.", "Nta. It's been 2 years. You've asked nicely repeatedly and they don't respect that", "NTA.  You stepped up to help out and they can\u2019t respect your boundaries. It is not your job to support them. That\u2019s a ridiculous amount of time for them to be there and not have anything to show for it. They should be thankful for your help because if it wasn\u2019t for you, they would either be unhappy or out on the streets anyways.", "they are both taking the piss throw them out", "NTA", "My ex husband and I still co-own, but he doesn\u2019t live here anymore. Mortgage means I can\u2019t move, so this actually could be an issue. Thanks for the heads up, I will reach out to a lawyer asap.", "Im 30, mother is 58 and brother is 27.", "Could you rent out their rooms for a year? Give them notice that from September you will be renting out both their rooms to cover your mortgage and the money they've drained from you the past 18 months. Then just keep updating them on how you're sending out adverts, send them legal letters that they have to vacate your property by August 27th so you can have the rooms cleaned for the new tenants, that their rooms have to be clean for viewings from July 25th.", "NTA,  but freeloaders never leave willingly.  Good luck.", "NTA. They're squatters and you need to issue them a leave notice, depending on where you live they might have 30 days to leave, and if they haven't left by then you can call the police.\n\nOr if you live somewhere without these laws protecting squatters you might be able to just straight up get them kicked out for trespassing. Talk to a legal advisor (a consultation with them is cheaper than a lawyer) to ask what you can do to legally kick them out asap since laws are different everywhere.\n\nIt's not your responsibility to provide for these people nor to tolerate them living with you. They're confident in the fact you don't have the guts to kick them out which is why they shamelessly continue on with their lives ignoring your demands.", "NTA but you dug a hole for yourself here by not keeping true to your word that they would have to leave if they didn't start helping out.Twice AND months apart. You showed them extreme generosity and that they can get away with explpiting it. Please do whatever you have to do to kick them out and make sure it is in a legal way and documented.

If you rent, consider moving and not sharing your new location. Okay, that's rough but they seriously cannot expect you to foot the bill anymore. If you own, look at the eviction laws.", "NTA but at this point you need to hire a lawyer and officially evict them.\n\nWhen they complain tell them they have had 2 years to save and move on, you have given them many chances, and it is now out of your hands: they need to deal with the lawyer. Then do not back down!", "They can establish residency.", "You need to give an official eviction notice because you won't go through with it otherwise.

Also, what kind of crappy people come to your place when YOU need help only to make your situation worse?", "NTA\n\nStop being emotionally abused and manipulated. They have taken advantage, and made their own decisions", "Well of course they won't take you seriously if you tell them twice to get a job or they'll be out and you never follow up. 18 months is 15 months too long in my book.

However, you don't have to feed them. You don't have to buy them clothes. You don't have to pay for their personal things. You should look up exactly what you don't have to do anymore, because making them uncomfortable will make them realize you are serious. You might want to find a flat-fee landlord lawyer to help you with the paperwork.", "NTA. Start taking control. If they\u2019re using your Wi-Fi, change the password. If you have streaming services, kick them off and change the passwords. Buy food for just you. Don\u2019t do anything for them. And start legal action.", "NTA.. you should never have offered that in the first place cuz all you are doing was being an ah to yourself. Unfortunately now they're freeloaders. And they will claim that they have reside there for long enough even though they've not paid a damn cent it's going to be harder than hell to evict them now", "NTA... WHY do you keep moving the date? You are TEACHING THEM TO IGNORE YOU. \n\nLearn to follow through. Kick them out. Maybe tell them they can return once they have their first paycheck.  \n\nYour are training them to be dependent on you and this is not good for them. You are causing them harm.\n\nIf you cant get them out of your house, then sell it and leave.", "Nta\nBut time for legal notice/eviction.\n\nAlso change passwords for WiFi, streaming services etc.  \n\nGet lock for fridge/pantry and stop providing them food.   \n\nDon't pay for insurance on their vehicles or health ins.  Don't pay for their cell services, etc. Do not let them use your stuff(car, etc).\n\nProvide only those services that you need to use like water/heat/electricity.", "NTA.

You are stronger now and thinking clearly. They need to go asap.", "YTNA.  Why do grown adults insist on mooching off others?  Get an eviction and be done with it.

Get the evictions notices ready. Get ready for them to talk smack behind your back. Be prepared to go no contact.", "NTA i had a VERY similar situation with my SIL literally last year.\nHad to kick her out because not only was she not contributing financially (which originally was fine cause it was peak recession at the time and my wife and I make more than enough to support them) \nBut she didnt do any of the daily chores and WOULD YELL and be RUDE to us at the apartment. We were so suck of being trampled on that we had to kick her out of the apartment.", "Absolutely NTA. You are badly being taken advantage of.", "NTA. They aren't stupid. They know what they're doing and you've proven you will let them and not mean it. So just go get an eviction from a lawyer. They've had enough chances.", "NTA. You've been more than accommodating, and you've given them plenty of warning. It's time to start the eviction process.", "And they also tend to leave destructively.", "\ud83d\udc46. You'll need to get legal guidance to get them put at this point.", "But what happens when the deadline passes, they haven't left, and she doesn't have renters? It's better to skip the pretenses of saying she is renting and start eviction proceedings.", "i understand you genuinely care for them and don\u2019t want them off on the streets but they\u2019re taking advantage of you and don\u2019t appreciate the care you have given them, it\u2019s best to drop them because if they felt the same love and support you feel about them they wouldn\u2019t be dismissing your feelings and living off of you", "NTJ (not the jerk) You told them when they moved in, at the end of last year, and again in February. Stop telling them and do it. It is not unreasonable to expect them to contribute to the expenses in the household or move out. Grown adults do not get an unlimited free ride.", "It's too late to get rid of them by the end of the month. You need to serve them with eviction papers now.\n\nNTA", "YTA. they're family you're evil for even thinking this", "NDA They had plenty of notice. They shouldn't be surprised pikachu that words mean what they  mean.\n\nTime to evict unfortunately.", "18 months? Wtf.\n\nDo your family hate you or something?", "NTA. See about serving eviction papers.  Tell them once more they need to find jobs or you will be serving eviction papers on x day. Then do it. They can chose to get jobs and contribute or they can chose to live on the street. They are full grown adults not helpless children.", "A \u201clegal advisor\u201c? I\u2019ve never heard of that, and I\u2019m a lawyer. In the US, at least states I am familiar with, it\u2019s illegal to give legal advice if you\u2019re not a licensed attorney. I\u2019m wondering what country has these sorts of legal advisors.", "Removing internet access might feel like shooting oneself in the foot these days with many jobs requesting online applications only so OP should be prepared to counter that argument with the local library as an option and if there are any places that assist with finding work. I know there are four or so government sponsored offices in my city that give computer access, help writing resumes and cover letters, free printing etc.\nForcing the freeloading family to be bored even if OP can't bring themself to lock the fridge will be a big step in getting them off their butts and taking her more seriously.", "I was thinking she should genuine rent out the rooms to cover her mortgage and save money. And also have a reason to get authorities involved if need be, \"new tenants are moving in and my family, who aren't homeowners and have been sent eviction letters, won't leave\".", "I'm aware,  but you didn't advise her to do it \nfor that reason, you advised her to do it to prevent her from backing out, which it won't."]}
