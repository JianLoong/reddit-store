You have provided them support but they have not taken it upon themselves to not take advantage. Since they ignored you they have had their second chance. They are old enough and wise enough to stand on their own two feet. You don't say if you won the home or if you rent. You don't indicate if you can move or if there are reasons why you can't - so I won't say - just move... but be prepared for them to not leave when the time is up and so you must plan what your next step will be. There have been too many stories out there of not being able to get rid of people from your home once they get a foot in the door. You need to be prepared to do whatever you must to get them or you out. Even talking with a lawyer for an hour might help you.", "Time to actually follow through with what you said, otherwise it\u2019s empty words.", "NTA.

Words are one thing, but when you serve them with actual, legal, paperwork they will get the idea.", "NTA they\u2019re blatantly taking advantage of them. It\u2019s their choice to do nothing with their lives they\u2019ve had more than an enough time to do literally anything. You need to kick them out or they\u2019ll never leave", "NTA, you are way more patient than I would have been. Why would they look for work when you are enabling them just to do what they want.", "Nta. It's been 2 years. You've asked nicely repeatedly and they don't respect that", "NTA.  You stepped up to help out and they can\u2019t respect your boundaries. It is not your job to support them. That\u2019s a ridiculous amount of time for them to be there and not have anything to show for it. They should be thankful for your help because if it wasn\u2019t for you, they would either be unhappy or out on the streets anyways.", "they are both taking the piss throw them out", "NTA", "My ex husband and I still co-own, but he doesn\u2019t live here anymore.

Give them notice that from September you will be renting out both their rooms to cover your mortgage and the money they've drained from you the past 18 months. Then just keep updating them on how you're sending out adverts, send them legal letters that they have to vacate your property by August 27th so you can have the rooms cleaned for the new tenants, that their rooms have to be clean for viewings from July 25th.", "NTA,  but freeloaders never leave willingly.  Good luck.", "NTA. They're squatters and you need to issue them a leave notice, depending on where you live they might have 30 days to leave, and if they haven't left by then you can call the police.\n\nOr if you live somewhere without these laws protecting squatters you might be able to just straight up get them kicked out for trespassing. Talk to a legal advisor (a consultation with them is cheaper than a lawyer) to ask what you can do to legally kick them out asap since laws are different everywhere.\n\nIt's not your responsibility to provide for these people nor to tolerate them living with you. They're confident in the fact you don't have the guts to kick them out which is why they shamelessly continue on with their lives ignoring your demands.", "NTA but you dug a hole for yourself here by not keeping true to your word that they would have to leave if they didn't start helping out.Twice AND months apart. You showed them extreme generosity and that they can get away with explpiting it. Please do whatever you have to do to kick them out and make sure it is in a legal way and documented.
