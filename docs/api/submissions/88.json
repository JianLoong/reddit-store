They stuck the tag, then rang the bell, and my neighbor whipped the door open before he could fully turn around. She. Went. Off. I rolled down my window to listen and apparently he\u2019d done this before so she was waiting and caught him having no intention of actually delivering her package. He sheepishly got the box, and as he returned to his truck she let him know the box was \u201cone of those doorbell cameras\u201d (very new tech at the time) and he\u2019d better not try that again or his supervisor would be getting a video.", "And you yell after them \u201cwait,wait!\u201d, they pretend not to hear you and take off", "I used to have medication delivered to my home. Got so many of those tags. I obviously made sure to be home all day on days my LIFESAVING MEDICATION was to be delivered. They never fucking knocked. My door was like three feet from my couch. Much as the service was theoretically convenient (it was through my transplant center) I had to stop. I can't risk running out of anti rejection meds like that."]}
