If she didnt know you were thinking of marrying this woman (at that time), she wouldnt have an issue with it.", "Info, in this picture are you obviously together with this women....hugging, kissing or otherwise obviously a couple?\n\nEven then I would say NTA but I am curious to know if your wife might dislike it because it shows your affection more then just seeing this girls face.\n\nI am sorry for your loss.", "NTA - why do people date others when they\u2019re so threatened by the fact that people have a past?", "NTA. It is a group photo of people you are close with from your past among other photos displayed. The only thing that might have given your wife a valid reason to dislike it was if it was the only photo and it was just Trina, or you and Trina. Your wife seriously needs to get over it, she's being irrational.", "NTA\n\nThat is strange.  Especially because it is a group photo.  I could understand if it was like a couple's homecoming photo where you're holding each other tenderly and it was also prominently displayed on your desk.  Anything short of that seems like unreasonable jealousy.", "NTA. Why be jealous of a dead person. I get her perspective because it reinforces the little voice that says \u201cyou were never his first choice\u201d but if you aren\u2019t hung up and moping then she needs to let it go.", "NTA, but I would talk to her and ask her about where this is coming from. Maybe she feels insecure about something in the relationship you guys can work on. I\u2019m sure the actual issue isn\u2019t the photo", "NTA.\n\nI can kind of understand your partner worrying a part of you is still hung up on her, feeling like you two would have never happened had the other girl not passed away. But that really is a her problem, coming a place of insecurity and not a healthy way of viewing past relationships.", "NTA, your wife needs to work on her insecurity. Trina went to meet the train half a lifetime ago. And what's more is that she helped you became the person you were when you met your wife. So whether or not your wife likes it Trina is part of you.", "NTA, really, but I do think that people don't really understand how anyone can have feelings about an ex who has passed. I think the issue is that the relationship didn't come to a natural end with a loss of feelings on both sides, it came to a tragic end which people can find hard to move on from. There's a worry that the one who passed was the one or holds a special place that others can't touch. I would imagine the blank, absolute refusal to consider doing this for your wife would make her feel like maybe the photo has a particular significance. \n\nBut that's something I think you need to talk about. It sounds like you're clear about your feelings, OP, but it's not clear what you've done to reassure your wife.", "NTA.

Has your wife always had a problem with this picture? Is she jealous in other ways?", "NTA. Being that it is a small group photo, on a wall of other photos, it seems perfectly fine to me. \n\nYour wife is feeling insecure. She is worried that you wish you were with Trina instead of her. You might want to give her some reassurance.\n\nIf you had a large photo of just the two of you in an embrace, I would side with your wife. But that is not the case.", "NTA.

Just make sure you don't first say \"I see the person I wanted to marry\". Jealousy is a weird emotion to navigate. I expect you don't but referring to them as the person I was going to marry is a bit much now you've moved on. Refer to them by name.", "NTA.

Being jealous of a dead person is weird...I'm sorry for your loss BTW. It's in your office, not like it's in the bedroom or living room.

That's pretty sad and pathetic.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s a picture of college friends. It\u2019s a happy time with happy memories. Your wife needs to deal with her jealousy. She\u2019s overreacting.", "NTA and I would suggest (if you havent already) putting up other pics too! Namely of your wife lol.", "NTA. I think your wife would have a leg to stand on if Trina were alive.", "NTA", "Nta for all the reasons mentioned.\n\nShe has soms insecurities she needs to work through.", "NTA I would seriously ask your wife why is she jealous and uncomfortable with a person who unfortunately passed. I get the history but to be upset is a bit ridiculous.", "NTA but I would caution you to be kind here. Her feelings are valid even if her actions are not. What your wife sees is the girl you would have married if she was still alive, which you freely admit. I would suggest getting your wife into therapy.", "NTA because there's some insecurity on her part, maybe if she hadn't died you'd have married her and you and your wife wouldn't have met.\n\nI think you need to find out what the real issue is.", "Is she upset because you wouldn't take it down when she asked or that it's there in the first place? Nta either way but if it's the former it could be she's upset because you'd rather keep a photo on display of someone you were supposed to marry than respect the wishes of the person you married. I am not sure exactly how I would feel in the given situation but i would think a photograph is pretty harmless. Again I don't think you're wrong, but maybe she thinks you're hung up on Trina because of the refusal to move it.", "NTA. She\u2019s being unreasonable. If it were a 20x24 of you and Trina I could understand. But this is a group of friends. Sorry for your loss.", "NTA. Someone who feels that threatened by a dead (edited) former partner, particularly in a group photo with a bunch of friends, really has some issues which need to be addressed - which you, OP, couldn't resolve in a million years simply by taking down a picture.\n\nI'd recommend that your wife talks to a therapist about her insecurities, as I suspect they predate you by a long time.", "NTA. You can\u2019t solve your wife\u2019s insecurity problems. That\u2019s on her.", "NTA \n\nWhy is your wife hung up on this? I would ask her about it. Trina is no threat to your wife.", "NTA\n\nThis is someone who died tragically many years ago. \n\nThat happened to someone I knew, as well. I wish I had a picture to remember her by. My wife wouldn't mind at all. It wouldn't even come up.", "Soft ESH and INFO\n\nI'd say N T A if your wife asked you to get rid of the photo but she didn't. Putting it in an album is probably already a compromise for her.\n\nYou have a right to keep memories and she has a right to not feel not great about them. \n\nDo you even know why it's such a big deal for her? Have you properly asked her - without making her feel guilty for her feelings? Has she given a decent reason, more than \"I just hate it\"? \n\nI don't think your wife feels threatened, but what if it makes her wonder every day if you love her less than your late fianc\u00e9? What if she doesn't want to be reminded of being the \"second choice\"? \n\nCommunicate with your partner. You are missing something and we can't tell what it is, only your wife can. And she should. Give her room to explain her feelings.", "Your wife is in a no win situation though because she is competing with a ghost isn\u2019t she as far as she is concerned ??? Have you tried to reassure her ?? Honestly the fact that she cares enough to be a bit jealous is a good thing. You didn\u2019t break up with this girl . She passed away and so it\u2019s hard to compete with that . You didn\u2019t fall out of love with her . You loved her after she died because that\u2019s what grief is . And grief and love aren\u2019t linear . So maybe talk to your wife instead of dismissing her concerns .

Put the shoe on the other foot: if she had pics of some dude that boned her, would you want them hanging up on the wall in your house? Doesn\u2019t matter who else is in the pic, that\u2019s all she sees.", "Make sure you have a good copy of that photo in case something happens to it one day. NTA", "NTA but I do have a question, how many people are in the photo?", "Sounds like she doesn\u2019t feel secure in your marriage so she fixated on the photo rather than the issue at hand. Maybe time for a talk (or two) to see how she feels your marriage is going?", "Without question NOT the arsehole.", "NTA", "quick question and no judgement, just wondering. do you have any framed pics of you and ur wife hung up around?", "YTA, you have a picture of someone you were in love with who was going to be your wife on your wall and look at it every day. Your wife looks at it every day.", "NTA. Your wife is heinous.", "Okay just another theory from internet strangers but how about we don\u2019t make our insecurities other people\u2019s problems? We don\u2019t take our insecurities out on our partners? We don\u2019t try to hurt our partners or make them unhappy just because we have issues with ourselves? \n\nHow about we figure our shit out because it\u2019s our own responsibility?", "I think it's relevant context. It's not just some ex. Ex implies broken up, which didn't happen. He was engaged to her, and his plan to marry her was interrupted by something truly random. He can't be called a widow because they didn't marry. Calling her that both conveys the reality of their relationship and the complexity of the grief involved - because there's not even a good word to describe that past relationship now.", "I\u2019d make a copy or two of that picture while he can. That photo seems like it\u2019s destined to suffer an \u201caccident\u201d and disappear/be irrevocably damaged.", "Amen", "If the wife had a picture of her ex on the wall and constantly referred to him as a saint (which is why I suspect this woman may not appreciate the photo) I would also tell her to take it down if it upsets her husband. \n\nIn fact, an ex of mine had an artist paint a scene I loved as a birthday card. On the back of the photo is sweet note explaining why he had this particular scene re-created for me. I tried to get rid of the painting but my husband likes it and knows that the ex means nothing to me. If it bothered him, I would take the painting, lovely as it is, down in a minute. \n\nThe wife didn't ask OP to get rid of it, just not to keep it where she would see it every time she entered the room.", "English is my first language, I only learned last year there's a different term for a woman v man who lose their spouse.  I can't keep them straight and I think it's dumb that there are different terms at all.  English is just fussy and dumb at times.", "The difference is that the \u201cwer\u201d suffix in \u201cwidow-wer\u201d is the same \u201cwer\u201d prefix in the word \u201cwer-wolf\u201d. \u201cWer\u201d is archaic English for \u201cman\u201d.", "Widowman, is an awesome superhero name. Cool to know though, thanks wer!"]}
