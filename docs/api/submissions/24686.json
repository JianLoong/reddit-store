It is a group photo of people you are close with from your past among other photos displayed. The only thing that might have given your wife a valid reason to dislike it was if it was the only photo and it was just Trina, or you and Trina. Your wife seriously needs to get over it, she's being irrational.", "NTA\n\nThat is strange.  Especially because it is a group photo.  I could understand if it was like a couple's homecoming photo where you're holding each other tenderly and it was also prominently displayed on your desk.  Anything short of that seems like unreasonable jealousy.", "NTA. Why be jealous of a dead person. I get her perspective because it reinforces the little voice that says \u201cyou were never his first choice\u201d but if you aren\u2019t hung up and moping then she needs to let it go.", "NTA, but I would talk to her and ask her about where this is coming from. Maybe she feels insecure about something in the relationship you guys can work on. I\u2019m sure the actual issue isn\u2019t the photo", "NTA.\n\nI can kind of understand your partner worrying a part of you is still hung up on her, feeling like you two would have never happened had the other girl not passed away. But that really is a her problem, coming a place of insecurity and not a healthy way of viewing past relationships.", "NTA, your wife needs to work on her insecurity. Trina went to meet the train half a lifetime ago. And what's more is that she helped you became the person you were when you met your wife. So whether or not your wife likes it Trina is part of you.", "NTA, really, but I do think that people don't really understand how anyone can have feelings about an ex who has passed. I think the issue is that the relationship didn't come to a natural end with a loss of feelings on both sides, it came to a tragic end which people can find hard to move on from. There's a worry that the one who passed was the one or holds a special place that others can't touch. I would imagine the blank, absolute refusal to consider doing this for your wife would make her feel like maybe the photo has a particular significance. \n\nBut that's something I think you need to talk about.

Being that it is a small group photo, on a wall of other photos, it seems perfectly fine to me. \n\nYour wife is feeling insecure. She is worried that you wish you were with Trina instead of her. You might want to give her some reassurance.\n\nIf you had a large photo of just the two of you in an embrace, I would side with your wife. But that is not the case.", "NTA.

Just make sure you don't first say \"I see the person I wanted to marry\". Jealousy is a weird emotion to navigate. I expect you don't but referring to them as the person I was going to marry is a bit much now you've moved on. Refer to them by name.", "NTA.

Being jealous of a dead person is weird...I'm sorry for your loss BTW. It's in your office, not like it's in the bedroom or living room. She doesn't have to go in there and look at it if she doesn't want to.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is jealous of a dead woman.  That's pretty sad and pathetic.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s a picture of college friends. It\u2019s a happy time with happy memories. Your wife needs to deal with her jealousy. She\u2019s overreacting.", "NTA and I would suggest (if you havent already) putting up other pics too! Namely of your wife lol.", "NTA. I think your wife would have a leg to stand on if Trina were alive.", "NTA", "Nta for all the reasons mentioned.\n\nShe has soms insecurities she needs to work through.", "NTA I would seriously ask your wife why is she jealous and uncomfortable with a person who unfortunately passed. I get the history but to be upset is a bit ridiculous.", "NTA but I would caution you to be kind here. Her feelings are valid even if her actions are not. What your wife sees is the girl you would have married if she was still alive, which you freely admit. I would suggest getting your wife into therapy.", "NTA because there's some insecurity on her part, maybe if she hadn't died you'd have married her and you and your wife wouldn't have met.\n\nI think you need to find out what the real issue is.", "Is she upset because you wouldn't take it down when she asked or that it's there in the first place? Nta either way but if it's the former it could be she's upset because you'd rather keep a photo on display of someone you were supposed to marry than respect the wishes of the person you married. I am not sure exactly how I would feel in the given situation but i would think a photograph is pretty harmless. Again I don't think you're wrong, but maybe she thinks you're hung up on Trina because of the refusal to move it.", "NTA. She\u2019s being unreasonable. If it were a 20x24 of you and Trina I could understand. But this is a group of friends. Sorry for your loss.", "NTA. Someone who feels that threatened by a dead ex-partner, particularly in a group photo with a bunch of friends, really has some issues which need to be addressed - which you, OP, couldn't resolve in a million years simply by taking down a picture.\n\nI'd recommend that your wife talks to a therapist about her insecurities, as I suspect they predate you by a long time.", "NTA. You can\u2019t solve your wife\u2019s insecurity problems. That\u2019s on her.", "NTA \n\nWhy is your wife hung up on this? I would ask her about it. Trina is no threat to your wife.", "NTA\n\nThis is someone who died tragically many years ago. \n\nThat happened to someone I knew, as well. I wish I had a picture to remember her by. My wife wouldn't mind at all. It wouldn't even come up.", "Soft ESH and INFO\n\nI'd say N T A if your wife asked you to get rid of the photo but she didn't. Putting it in an album is probably already a compromise for her.\n\nYou have a right to keep memories and she has a right to not feel not great about them. \n\nDo you even know why it's such a big deal for her? Have you properly asked her - without making her feel guilty for her feelings? Has she given a decent reason, more than \"I just hate it\"? \n\nI don't think your wife feels threatened, but what if it makes her wonder every day if you love her less than your late fianc\u00e9? What if she doesn't want to be reminded of being the \"second choice\"? \n\nCommunicate with your partner. You are missing something and we can't tell what it is, only your wife can. And she should. Give her room to explain her feelings.", "Your wife is in a no win situation though because she is competing with a ghost isn\u2019t she as far as she is concerned ??? Have you tried to reassure her ?? Honestly the fact that she cares enough to be a bit jealous is a good thing. You didn\u2019t break up with this girl . She passed away and so it\u2019s hard to compete with that . You didn\u2019t fall out of love with her . You loved her after she died because that\u2019s what grief is . And grief and love aren\u2019t linear . So maybe talk to your wife instead of dismissing her concerns .

She can't compare to golden memory. \n\nPeople whose past loves are alive can connect briefly and see, oh, look they've aged too, wrinkles and a body soft from kids is normal, and you know that person you loved once is not perfect but just human.
