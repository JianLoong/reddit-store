I was thrilled and excited to be included, but then she informed me that the dress code for the bridal party was gender-specific, with women expected to wear dresses and men expected to wear suits. As someone who identifies as non-binary and is more masculine presenting, I am uncomfortable with conforming to a gender binary that doesn't accurately represent me. I brought this up with my brother and his fianc\u00e9, but they insisted that they wanted all their guests to adhere to the dress code, regardless of how it made them feel.\n\nI ultimately decided that I did not want to attend the wedding, as I did not feel comfortable being pressured to conform to a gender binary that doesn't accurately represent me. My brother and his fianc\u00e9 are now upset with me, accusing me of being difficult and not willing to compromise.\n\nAfter a fight with them, I found out they went behind my back and involved my mom. She called me yesterday and told me I can put aside my identity for one day to make the day special for my little brother. \n\nI now feel bad and didn't realize something as small as the clothes I feel comfortable wearing would cause a rift within my family. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to go to the wedding?", "created_utc": 1678908790, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11s6pb9/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_my_brothers_wedding/", "score": 317, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was thrilled and excited to be included, but then she informed me that the dress code for the bridal party was gender-specific, with women expected to wear dresses and men expected to wear suits. As someone who identifies as non-binary and is more masculine presenting, I am uncomfortable with conforming to a gender binary that doesn't accurately represent me. I brought this up with my brother and his fianc\u00e9, but they insisted that they wanted all their guests to adhere to the dress code, regardless of how it made them feel.\n\nI ultimately decided that I did not want to attend the wedding, as I did not feel comfortable being pressured to conform to a gender binary that doesn't accurately represent me. My brother and his fianc\u00e9 are now upset with me, accusing me of being difficult and not willing to compromise.\n\nAfter a fight with them, I found out they went behind my back and involved my mom. She called me yesterday and told me I can put aside my identity for one day to make the day special for my little brother. \n\nI now feel bad and didn't realize something as small as the clothes I feel comfortable wearing would cause a rift within my family. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to go to the wedding?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
