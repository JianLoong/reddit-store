I was thrilled and excited to be included, but then she informed me that the dress code for the bridal party was gender-specific, with women expected to wear dresses and men expected to wear suits. As someone who identifies as non-binary and is more masculine presenting, I am uncomfortable with conforming to a gender binary that doesn't accurately represent me. I brought this up with my brother and his fianc\u00e9, but they insisted that they wanted all their guests to adhere to the dress code, regardless of how it made them feel.\n\nI ultimately decided that I did not want to attend the wedding, as I did not feel comfortable being pressured to conform to a gender binary that doesn't accurately represent me. My brother and his fianc\u00e9 are now upset with me, accusing me of being difficult and not willing to compromise.\n\nAfter a fight with them, I found out they went behind my back and involved my mom. She called me yesterday and told me I can put aside my identity for one day to make the day special for my little brother. \n\nI now feel bad and didn't realize something as small as the clothes I feel comfortable wearing would cause a rift within my family. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to go to the wedding?", "created_utc": 1678908790, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11s6pb9/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_my_brothers_wedding/", "score": 9371, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was thrilled and excited to be included, but then she informed me that the dress code for the bridal party was gender-specific, with women expected to wear dresses and men expected to wear suits. As someone who identifies as non-binary and is more masculine presenting, I am uncomfortable with conforming to a gender binary that doesn't accurately represent me. I brought this up with my brother and his fianc\u00e9, but they insisted that they wanted all their guests to adhere to the dress code, regardless of how it made them feel.\n\nI ultimately decided that I did not want to attend the wedding, as I did not feel comfortable being pressured to conform to a gender binary that doesn't accurately represent me. My brother and his fianc\u00e9 are now upset with me, accusing me of being difficult and not willing to compromise.\n\nAfter a fight with them, I found out they went behind my back and involved my mom. She called me yesterday and told me I can put aside my identity for one day to make the day special for my little brother. \n\nI now feel bad and didn't realize something as small as the clothes I feel comfortable wearing would cause a rift within my family. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to go to the wedding?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

'Man in a dress' has been an ongoing gag in every type of media for decades way past the 1950s. A lot of gender double standards and such are based in misogyny, that is true- feminine men are seen as lesser because femininity is connected to being a woman, and women are seen as lesser.\n\nAs long as we have a society that teaches children 'this is for boys to wear and this is for girls to wear', 'this is what a girl looks like, this is what a boy looks like' we're going to have these issues. The issue isn't even transphobes at some points, the issue is that society itself is BINARY. People walking down the street will see a Pre-T trans man in a dress and see him as a woman. Because of how his body is shaped and what he is wearing. \n\nThat's why dysphoria hoodies are such a common experience- hiding those traits makes lots of us feel relief, because when people look at me and don't see boobs, maybe they won't immediately assume I'm a woman! Maybe if I wear baggy clothes and hide my chest and don't talk people won't see me as a woman. Like, if you met me in public, I'm sure you would immediately assume I was a woman. I have a chest, I have a higher voice, and I am feminine. This isn't about you individually respecting trans people, it's the societal convention of what is a man and what is a woman.\n\nIn the same way, forcing a nonbinary person into a piece of clothing they have a history of saying makes them uncomfortable or dysphoric is like someone putting me in a dress with cleavage visible and telling me ' but it's okay, you're still a man'\n\nThat's not the point. The point is that other people will see a woman who doesn't truly exist. The assigned female at birth trans person will have to stand there knowing that everyone who sees them will see a woman and not who they really are.

Queer creators and queer ally spaces are a great way to educate yourself on queer topics without putting the onus on your friends or loved ones who are part of the community. Making this learning a priority in your life WILL reflect and your friends WILL appreciate it.\n\nStart small. You don't need to learn all of the hottest topics in gender theory in one day. Small, consistent efforts over time will yield the best results. It's like exercise.\n\nTikTok in particular has a wealth of educational material and truly phenomenal queer creators talking about their lived experiences and the issues they face on a daily basis. They often include information on what would be helpful for allies to do in XYZ situations.\n\nIf you and your friend have this kind of relationship, and they want to be open/up front about their status as non-binary, maybe ask them about what gives them gender euphoria.

I'm sorry that your family is so ignorant and disrespectful. Don't bow! If they are anything like my family (sounds quite like it) they will push you further and further and they won't care about your happiness and at some point you will look back and realize that you tried to make them comfortable and keep the peace for decades and it was all wasted time and energy that you won't get back.", "When the groom\u2019s sibling is non-binary, requesting all guests dress according to gender assigned at birth seems like an individual call out.\n\nThe bride and groom are making the denial of OP\u2019s gender identification a feature of their wedding.\n\nIt\u2019s mean spirited and ugly.\n\nOP you are NTA, and your brother and sister-in-law to be owe you an apology for the insult against you they\u2019ve made.", "Everything about this. My side of the bridal party had 4 females and 1 male. One of the females said to me that she would not be wearing a dress as she preferred men\u2019s clothing. Okay, fine by me. My husband and I said as long as they have something on with our color in it is fine, just be comfortable. My friends took that part seriously: She and my male friend included me in a group text with hex codes for colors and where they found the dress shirts they liked best and when they were going on sale. \n\nMy wedding pics were fabulous and wonderful since all our friends were happy and representing themselves.

My sister wore a pant suit to my wedding some 10+ years ago and I thought she looked so cool. She's never liked dresses or feminine looks so my mum suggested she wear the suit and I was just glad she found something she liked. But my point is, she's straight. And if a straight person wants to wear a suit to the wedding, they wear a suit to the wedding.

And I don't have kids and probably won't have any. So we just stayed friends. We've cried on each other's shoulders about shitty partners, and a lot of women have taken advantage of him because he's such a kind and generous person.

I was the first person he told that he was going to propose. \"I guess I have to get a ring,\" he said. It took a second, but then I realized exactly what he meant and I was SO happy for him!

Do they seriously put \u201ca look\u201d over people\u2019s identity and needs? There is nothing wrong with requiring formal dress for a wedding. Even giving examples is fine. But any more you simply cannot dictate more than that. A tux on a woman looks fine, and blends in just fine. A man wearing a formal dress kilt and jacket can look spectacular!
