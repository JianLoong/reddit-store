I have 3 copies of lord of the rings, anyways, I live in a small apartment next to a mother and small girl; her mother works a lot. One day she asked me what I was reading when she and her mother were coming back, I said I was reading a Stephen King book, she said it looked cool and wondered if she could borrow. I said I had another book that may be more suitable, she was around 10 at this time, so I lent her Coraline by Neil Gaiman which is a classic, and she loved it. She always returned them in a neat condition so I had no problem lending her more books, and I like to encourage people to read.\n\nThis started a thing where I would lend her books sometimes, she did her own reading as well; she's advanced quite far, and I lent her lord of the rings which she finished surprisingly quick. Recently she finished my copy of Frankenstein, I asked her mother beforehand and then I lent her my copy of wuthering heights. Because I figured wuthering heights may not be appropriate for a 12 year old, and I didn't want to start any trouble with her mother, anyways, she finished it and I lent her a copy of dune which started this saga. I figured that since her mother was okay with wuthering heights then dune wouldn't be much of an issue. Well I was wrong, her mother berated me because dune is anti religious, and she didn't like the anti religious themes in dune. I always figured that dune was more of a warning against charismatic leaders rather than being anti religion because Paul is not the hero.\n\nI assumed that since she was okay with wuthering heights she'd be alright with dune as well, she sternly warned me about lending books like dune.

I've met witches, spies, nomads, vampires, gypsies, farmers and faeries. \n\nI've flown in the back of a dragon. I've tasted spaceship rations and wooly mammoth meat.

I've learned, I've loved, I've lost, I've won, I've rejoiced and despaired. \n\nMy favorites are there to comfort me time and time again, and there are always new worlds waiting to be discovered. \n\nYou are amazing. \n\nIf she's old enough to read it and understand it, then she probably has those vague, unformed questions anyway.

Given the other books she's borrowed from you, Dune seems like a strange one for her mother to complain about.", "NTA --- The mother obviously hasn't even read the books herself as the Bene Gesserit feature throughout the whole series and they are a religion within the series, the mother's problem is probably that the religion used isn't Christianity.", "NTA. \n\nI first read orwell at 11 and A Clockwork Orange at 12, and there is nothing in Dune that compares to the latter", "NTA. Reading is to encourage open minded thinking, you cannot censor what someone reads that\u2019s crazy. I get not wanting to give a kid an adult themed book purely because of the content, but to kick off because it might be considered anti-religious?

At the same time,  at no point did the mother ask to review which books you give her daughter or state that certain themes are a problem for her, so... she sort of trusted your judgment.

So many kids are trapped by social media. You are fostering healthy habits. The girl is smart to read such advanced books at her age. \n\nAs a religious person myself, occasionally I read a book or consume other media with an anti religious message. While it can make me uncomfortable, I am open to hearing other opinions. This actually helps strengthen my own beliefs when I see where an author is shortsighted or closed minded. For the mom, if religion is important to her, she should focus on teaching her daughter her values which shouldn't include censoring viewpoints she disagrees with. Of course there's nothing you can do to tell her how to parent her child or convince her she's wrong, though you might need to compromise to keep the relationship open so that you can continue helping this girl find good books (maybe promise to ask the mom in advance before you lend the book).\n\nIt sounds like you are making good judgment on what's appropriate for a twelve year old.
