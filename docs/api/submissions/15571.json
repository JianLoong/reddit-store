And ridiculous. It's completely NORMAL for couples or even friends to do their own thing for parts of the day on vacation! Even on a family trip. Your SIL is right, you invited them to essentially help with babysitting without letting them know lol... and then get butthurt when they spend a little bit of time doing adult things. You have kids, they don't. You then ruined your own time and made them spend less of they vacy with you because you confronted them about it. Real piece of work. Can't reiterate the YTA enough.", "YTA, easily. They DID spend time with you and your kids. It sounds like you wanted them to spend all day everyday with them and as your SIL said, be their babysitter while you relaxed.

Like wtf lol, get a grip.", "YTA. They are not obligated to help you with your kids. It almost seems like you wanted them there to relieve stress than actual bonding time.

You neglect to mention if you paid for SIL's trip or if you had a conversation with her that you expected her to play nanny to your children. If she paid her own way, she did absolutely nothing wrong. If you paid for her, it would have been nice if she spent more time with your family, but unless you specifically asked her to help with your kids and she agreed, she was under no obligation to stay by your side the whole trip.\n\nIt sounds like the real issue here is your health. If you are unable to manage your kids at a theme park over a multi-day visit that's a problem. If your conditions are ones that are able to improve, you need to take responsibility and make changes that will allow you to take care of your children the way you want to and be there for them as you age. If these are untreatable conditions, it is your responsibility to either hire someone who will be able to help you with child care or make an arrangement with a relative to help out with responsibilities clearly understood by both parties.\n\nYou've made this situation worse by sending out a catty email to the family. If you had a problem with SIL you should have worked this out with her directly.

Maybe get in shape next time you decide to invite someone without telling them they\u2019re your babysitter.", "Yta theyre not your free on hand babysitters get into shape for the sake of your kids.", "Yta- so you only invited SIL because you assumed she will babysit your kids because shes faaaaaamiiilly , Without you even having the decency to ask if she\u2019s okay with it. \n\n\nHire a babysitter next time .", "INFO:\n1) did you pay for the hotels and meals for SIL+Hubs?\n2) did you have a conversation with them about if they would be willing to help with the kids?\n3) how old are they kids (and number)?", "There is so much wrong with your post that I dont know where to begin.\n\nThey are your kids, you need to look after them, if you want help then you have to pay for someone and explain their duties and your expectations.\n\nDid you even pay for their trip or just invite them along.\n\nYTA and a massive one. and despite huge competition for things you have said this has to be the biggest AH comment\n\n**I was so upset that they ruined the experience for our kids who were looking forward to spending time with their aunt'**\n\nhahah, you honestly trying to guilt people into thinking a) your kids traveled to Disney world to spend time with their Aunt and b) |Your kids couldnt haven't had a good time with you.\n\nYour SIL must be laughing hr head off. She is probably peeved at how entitled you are, but now you have openly proved it to the whole family.\n\nAlso I am guessing no one will be looking to join you on any trips. \n\nYou better get yourselves in shape so you can look aftr your kids", "Hahahahaha, this is so funny. You took them on vacation assuming they would babysit. They didn't. So you got upset and sent a email to the Whole family to complain about what horrible people they were and you got your A handed to you....YTA", "How dare they enjoy their vacation, who the hell do they think they are? Clearly not your personal babysitters, the cheek of it, having an alcoholic drink on holiday, for shame.\n\nIf you're not fit enough to look after your children then do something about it.\n\nYTA", "YTA\u2026 from the tone of this post I\u2019m shocked that SIL agreed to spend any time with you as family, let alone as a free babysitter", "Seems like you ruined the vacation for your SIL and yourself. Assuming you still took the kids to do fun shit, it wasn\u2019t ruined for them. And if it was, that\u2019s your fault. YTA", "YTA\n\nYou didn't ask them to come because you wanted to spend time with them; you asked them to come so that they could provide childcare... and \"conveniently\" forgot to mention that to either of them.\n\nThey absolutely had the right to go off and do their own thing after spending mornings with you, your partner, and the kids:  I'm pretty sure that if this had happened the other way around, we'd be reading about how annoyed you are that your SIL and her partner assumed you'd take on the care of THEIR kids during YOUR holiday.", "YTA. Your relatives did you a favor to look after your kids for some time. It isn't and wasn't their obligation. You should be grateful that they did in the first place. Neither is it their obligation to behave in a way you expect them to. You are delusional expecting the world to revolve around you and your email is the written proof to the world for this.", "YTA. You tried to pull a bait-and-switch, and it failed. You wanted a travel nanny and didn't want to pay, so you tried to trick your in-laws into spending their own money and PTO babysitting your kids. You should be apologizing for your own behavior, not trying to play victim because they didn't fall for it.", "YTA. Sounds like she did spend a lot of time with you and the kids so I don\u2019t see what she did wrong? She isn\u2019t a babysitter and from the post it looks like you didn\u2019t tell her your expectations before the trip and tried to foist your kids on her.", "Jesus reallly?! How are you not realizing your an asshole after writing this down? You literally wanted a free babysitter. This wasn\u2019t about family, this was about using your SIL and being upset that she actually had the spine to put her foot down. Also I hope that temper tantrum of an email was worth alienating your husbands family. You will probably never be invited to events for them again. And I do mean just you, your husband and kids will still be invited.", "I don\u2019t think OP paid for SIL and BIL or she would have used it to justify her entitlement.\n\nOP is YTA.", "Bingo. Also they spent the morning with them, and went off in the afternoon to do their own thing.\n\nOP is basically complaining that two adults who paid for themselves wouldn't let OP take advantage of them. I think OP is about to find she runs into a number of issues with her in laws in the future.", "OP thought she did, she just neglected to tell her sister in law she was invited to a \"family vacation\" to babysit her children.", "I'm laughing too. Seriously - the entitlement...\n\nWhip your asses into shape and be responsible for your kids ffs.\n\nYTA", "As a fat bitch, I gotta agree. It\u2019s hilarious. It\u2019s hilarious that they wrote this and posted it.", "i agree that OP is the AH, but fat shaming doesn\u2019t need to be brought into this.", "2 kids, not 4.\n\nOP is still YTA!", "You can definitely catch a buzz drinking around the world, especially in the FL heat if you aren\u2019t also supplementing with water (hard lesson learned) so that part is probably legit.", "Pretty sure the family rolled their eyes en masse upon receiving it.", "Seriously. Causing a rift in the family over something so selfish and stupid is well, selfish and stupid, FFS. OP I can\u2019t believe you involved the rest of the family over your unspoken expectations. Are you a child? The worst kind of adult complains to mommy when they don\u2019t get their way.", "The thing is, SIL DID spend half of both the 1st and 2nd days with them! That was not enough for OP!", ">Was it clearly communicated to sister-in-law that if she accepted the invitation that they would be expected to spend time with your kids?\n\nLOL they did spend time with the kids, they just didn't spend every waking second taking care of the kids like OP wanted.", "\"I just assumed she would spend time with family on family vacation clearly she doesn't not value family.\"\n\nTranslation: \"Why will you not babysit my children for free? They're your *family*; it's your responsibility!\"\n\nThe nerve, saying that she was hurt by SIL not wanting to spend time with family, when in reality, she's just salty that SIL refused to take responsibility of kids that aren't even hers.", "Normally I\u2019d agree but OP and her hubs used their physical situation as justification for expecting free baby sitting on this trip. That\u2019s not okay; that means their condition is impacting their kids as well as themselves and they\u2019re using it as a way to pass childcare along to someone else. That\u2019s as nasty a behavior as fat shaming, they\u2019re doing so *because* of their weight, and in that instance, they should be called to accountability for abusing their weight to manipulate others.", "OP brought it on themself.", "What comment fat shamed them?", "It\u2019s not really fat shaming tho. It\u2019s more excuse shaming. OP made it about weight.", "Oops! Somehow I read 'four days' and that turned into \"four kids\". XD\n\nFixed it.", "They were adults on vacation so, unless they were falling down drunk, I don't even see this as legit. I'm from Wisconsin. It would be unusual for kids to NOT see adults tipsy while on vacation...", "Clearly...thanks for pointing out what I already read.", "That's what I figured happened."]}
