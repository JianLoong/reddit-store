Again, what is the problem with this?\n* That night, they met you for dinner and were tipsy. So what. They are on vacation.\n* You go to their room late at night and whined that they weren't spending any time with you. They spent more than half of the first 2 days with you!\n* You then blasted to your family that you SIL \"ruined\" your vacation.\n* You are planning on going LC with your SIL because she does not value family.\n\nYour SIL is probably very grateful that you are going LC as you seem to believe family values mean your relatives are responsible for taking care of your children at their expense.\n\nYTA!", "YTA.\n\nIf you want someone to help you out with your kids, hire someone. \n\nThe entitlement here !!! \n\nHoney, you chose to have your kids.

And ridiculous. It's completely NORMAL for couples or even friends to do their own thing for parts of the day on vacation! Even on a family trip. Your SIL is right, you invited them to essentially help with babysitting without letting them know lol... and then get butthurt when they spend a little bit of time doing adult things. You have kids, they don't. You then ruined your own time and made them spend less of they vacy with you because you confronted them about it. Real piece of work. Can't reiterate the YTA enough.", "YTA, easily. They DID spend time with you and your kids. It sounds like you wanted them to spend all day everyday with them and as your SIL said, be their babysitter while you relaxed. I understand it's hard to manage children, that's why I don't have them. That's your responsibility though, not your SIL's. And calling them out wrongfully to the rest of the family and going LC? Like wtf lol, get a grip.", "YTA. They are not obligated to help you with your kids. It almost seems like you wanted them there to relieve stress than actual bonding time.

You only invited them as free labor/babysitters but didn't reveal that plan until it was too late for them to decline the invite.  Then you got upset when she told you no.

You sent a ridiculous email to stir up drama. You are the issue here.", "YTA Your SIL did spend time with your family, but also did things you obviously weren't up to or interested in doing. You neglect to mention if you paid for SIL's trip or if you had a conversation with her that you expected her to play nanny to your children. If she paid her own way, she did absolutely nothing wrong. If you paid for her, it would have been nice if she spent more time with your family, but unless you specifically asked her to help with your kids and she agreed, she was under no obligation to stay by your side the whole trip.\n\nIt sounds like the real issue here is your health. If you are unable to manage your kids at a theme park over a multi-day visit that's a problem. If your conditions are ones that are able to improve, you need to take responsibility and make changes that will allow you to take care of your children the way you want to and be there for them as you age. If these are untreatable conditions, it is your responsibility to either hire someone who will be able to help you with child care or make an arrangement with a relative to help out with responsibilities clearly understood by both parties.\n\nYou've made this situation worse by sending out a catty email to the family. If you had a problem with SIL you should have worked this out with her directly. If you felt she wasn't spending enough time with your family, you should have addressed it with her on the first day of the vacation instead of quietly seething and allowing your resentment to build.

You did not make it completely clear when you invited them that you would need them to stay with you and help with the kids the whole time. \n\nThe only thing I see them having done wrong is drink around the world and then be around the kids.

It's also not SIL's fault that she doesn't look like an ass along with you. \n\nAs a grown woman and a mother, you have a responsibility to only rely on someone for childcare when they have given explicit agreement.
