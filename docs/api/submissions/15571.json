Again, what is the problem with this?\n* That night, they met you for dinner and were tipsy. So what. They are on vacation.\n* You go to their room late at night and whined that they weren't spending any time with you. They spent more than half of the first 2 days with you!\n* You then blasted to your family that you SIL \"ruined\" your vacation.\n* You are planning on going LC with your SIL because she does not value family.\n\nYour SIL is probably very grateful that you are going LC as you seem to believe family values mean your relatives are responsible for taking care of your children at their expense.\n\nYTA!", "YTA.\n\nIf you want someone to help you out with your kids, hire someone. \n\nThe entitlement here !!! \n\nHoney, you chose to have your kids.

And ridiculous. It's completely NORMAL for couples or even friends to do their own thing for parts of the day on vacation! Even on a family trip. Your SIL is right, you invited them to essentially help with babysitting without letting them know lol... and then get butthurt when they spend a little bit of time doing adult things. You have kids, they don't. You then ruined your own time and made them spend less of they vacy with you because you confronted them about it. Real piece of work. Can't reiterate the YTA enough.", "YTA, easily. They DID spend time with you and your kids. It sounds like you wanted them to spend all day everyday with them and as your SIL said, be their babysitter while you relaxed. I understand it's hard to manage children, that's why I don't have them. That's your responsibility though, not your SIL's. And calling them out wrongfully to the rest of the family and going LC? Like wtf lol, get a grip.", "YTA. They are not obligated to help you with your kids. It almost seems like you wanted them there to relieve stress than actual bonding time.

I'm guessing not.\n\nYTA. They are not obligated to play babysitter for you. You were the one who decided to take them to the park, knowing that you had to keep watch over young children.

You sent a ridiculous email to stir up drama. You are the issue here.", "YTA Your SIL did spend time with your family, but also did things you obviously weren't up to or interested in doing. You neglect to mention if you paid for SIL's trip or if you had a conversation with her that you expected her to play nanny to your children. If she paid her own way, she did absolutely nothing wrong. If you paid for her, it would have been nice if she spent more time with your family, but unless you specifically asked her to help with your kids and she agreed, she was under no obligation to stay by your side the whole trip.\n\nIt sounds like the real issue here is your health. If you are unable to manage your kids at a theme park over a multi-day visit that's a problem. If your conditions are ones that are able to improve, you need to take responsibility and make changes that will allow you to take care of your children the way you want to and be there for them as you age. If these are untreatable conditions, it is your responsibility to either hire someone who will be able to help you with child care or make an arrangement with a relative to help out with responsibilities clearly understood by both parties.\n\nYou've made this situation worse by sending out a catty email to the family. If you had a problem with SIL you should have worked this out with her directly. If you felt she wasn't spending enough time with your family, you should have addressed it with her on the first day of the vacation instead of quietly seething and allowing your resentment to build.

You only control you and if you want things to work than you need to do it right.\n\nEDIT: Let me clarify, I got the impression that the family was expecting the SIL to spend all four days with them in some capacity (**edit2: because of nieces and nephews, she should have said it was a \"family\" vacation in advance and not invited them under a guise.)**  I was trying to say, the family never ever once said or asked if SIL were going to spend the whole time together, so it made sense to me she should have communicated that and not gone off afterward for something she never said or ever should have expected.\n\n**Second Edit:  Not exactly sure what I am not making clear but OP is the AH, SIL got put on blast for no reason, and what she did was messed up.**", "YTA. \n\nYou didn't state your ages, but I'm still confident that you're well aware of what happens when you make big assumptions, OP.

It's also not SIL's fault that she doesn't look like an ass along with you. \n\nAs a grown woman and a mother, you have a responsibility to only rely on someone for childcare when they have given explicit agreement.
