She cooked the a week\u2019s worth of meals without his help, that means she can do it. She just asked help for rolling some burritos. The only mistake she did was planning to make burritos, she could have made something else. \n\n\nAll this does not indicate wife\u2019s lack of respect for OP. Just OP\u2019s AH attitude towards his wife.\n\nYou love your wife and it shows, but OP does not and that shows too.\n\nETA: I just read the post again and she had asked him if he can help 3 weeks ago. If he would have said \u2018no\u2019 then and there she could have thought about making something else. But since he said yes, she went ahead with the burrito plan expecting her husband to help because he said so. She did not ask him last min to help, but three weeks ago. Hell, she asked him in the morning too. If he would have said no in the morning even then she could have made something else, instead of waiting for her husband to get back from work and getting yelled at.", "Make something else? Enlist someone else's help? Struggle to try herself until she was in pain?", "? What?\n\n You said she was a doormat for her friends because she's not making a profit. Is kindness such a foreign concept?", "I'd be willing to bet that the arthritis diagnosis didn't happen until after they got married, and now he's suddenly \"stuck\" with a young disabled wife. It's just easier for him to be abusive than to leave her at this point, because maybe if he's awful enough she'll leave on her own and he won't have to do that work either.   \n\nIt's sadly common for men to start treating their wives horribly or straight up leaving them after a chronic illness diagnosis. The whole \"in sickness and in health\" part of many wedding vows doesn't actually mean anything to some people.", "I surely do genuinely hope so.", "No because they would ask for me to do the vacuum cleaning, or to help them with housework.\n\nOPs wife didn\u2019t ask for help making burritos, but help rolling them, that implies that at least some effort would be made on her part.", "Hmm let\u2019s see.\n\nShe could have started with not volunteering to do something that she couldn\u2019t do in the first place.\n\nOr she could have actually asked OP exactly what she wanted off him. She probably didn\u2019t because she knew if she did OP would have said no.\n\nOr she could have actually made an effort and rolled some.\n\nAny of the above would have been better than what she did.\n\nAnd any of the above would have meant that if OP acted in the same manner, it would be just him being an AH, not both of them.", "Or even explain to the friend that she couldn't do it after all - at some point \\*before\\* the money had been spent, the prep had been done, and the friend and her family were quite reasonably expecting their dinner.", "Me too. I can relate to her so much, & I know it isn\u2019t easy to get out through. My ex was abusive when I was newly disabled in my 20s, & it made it so much harder to leave. My ex made me feel like I owed him,l for any little thing, so I felt like I deserved the situation I was in, & like I couldn\u2019t leave.\n\nNow, years later, I\u2019m in a wonderful relationship with a amazing man. Technically I\u2019m more disabled now than I was in my 20s, but I can do so much more nowadays because my partner & I support each other. The difference is night & day. I hope she sees that she deserves so much better", "Making burritos is making the filling, rolling them, and cooking them. Wtf is she supposed to do if she needs - and was promised - help with the middle step?", "Lol you're ridiculous.", "What\u2019s worse is I can imagine how her perspective may be and it would be hell. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she listens for how he opens the door when he gets home, how he puts down his keys\u2026 hell, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she can hear his car turn into the neighborhood and guess his mood based on the way his car sounds pulling up. I\u2019ve been there, the way he is describing their interactions is so telling.\n\nOf course I want to believe that he\u2019s just been a dillweed a couple times, that it\u2019s not that serious, but more likely than not it is serious. This type of shit wears a person down. One day you\u2019re upset because you were yelled at and then next thing you know you\u2019re sleeping with your car keys in your pocket and an overnight bag packed in a hidden spot. Might sound dramatic, but I\u2019d rather be dramatic and wrong over the opposite."]}
