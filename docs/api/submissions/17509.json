Communicate better or suck it up", "YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re a bad husband. She didn\u2019t volunteer you. She asked if you could, you said yes. She double-checked, you doubled down on being willing to help. She says \u201cokay, time to help\u201d and you explode at her? What is wrong with you?! Don\u2019t yell at your poor wife because you have communication issues. Probably don\u2019t yell at your wife at all. You sound borderline abusive. \n\nAnd so what she asked you to help during the holidays? You should be helping your wife prep food for the holidays and she\u2019s not even asking much?!?", "YTA. You did sign on to this when you told your wife you would help.", "Dude. Stop yelling at your wife. Stop saying yes when you mean no then punishing her for it. \n\nYTA", "YTA. If you didn't want to do it you just had to say it. If you never addressed the topic with her, and just came here to ask for our opinion, please know that you are doing terrible with your communication skills.\n\nOr do you also have trouble saying no to things? That would be an additional problem. You can perfectly decline in a calmed manner. It is just so much easier. So you have just created this problem now.", "ESH Your wife for being a doormat to her friends, since she didn\u2019t make any money. And you for going back on your word. You\u2019re both exactly the same. You both agree to things you shouldn\u2019t do.", "YTA \n\nWhy did you keep saying you would help her if you didn't want to help her. Why would you yell at her for asking you to help her do something that you already agreed to help her with.", "YTA. \n\n>My (35) wife (35) always volunteers to do everything. Yet she always manages to drag me into helping her.\n\nWhat a LIAR. She ASKED if you could help. YOU SAID YES. You AGREED. You were just angry that she really asked you for the thing you agreed to do and decided that screaming to shift blame and abuse her would be a good way to get out of the commitment you took on.", "YTA why even say yes?", "Sounds like she was waiting for you to have time so that you could roll burritos together since you agreed to help her, and you were waiting for her to eventually give up on waiting for you, push through her arthritis and just do it herself. This could have been avoided if you had just been honest and said you didn't want to help her but you strung her along until you were so tired of her asking that you yelled at her. YTA", "[removed]", "YTA! You AGREED to help her....repeatedly!!! You don't say yes and then get to be upset about doing it", "YTA. She's not making you help. She's not volunteering *you* to do anything. She asked if you could help. You agreed. She confirmed that you could still help. You said yes. You're a giant AH for yelling at her and making shit up about how she's always making you help.", "YTA. You are upset at your wife for signing up to help people. You then proceed to sign up to help your wife. Are we the A H for calling you out in your hypocrisy?", "You could have told her how you feel to begin with, and you wouldn't have had to yell. YTA.", "YTA, in more than one way. Telling your wife you'd help, then getting mad at her for expecting you to help is definitely AH territory. \n\nYelling at your wife for any reason is not okay. It's AH territory. It sounds like you stewed about this all week, building up a head of steam, and then blew your top.\n\nExpecting her to profit off her friendship. You don't say why the friend wanted your wife to cook dinners. So your level of AH-ness here is dependent on the answer. If she's incapacitated in some way, that would level up the AH-ness.  \n\nBut the biggest thing that screams AH to me is how cavalier and dismissive you are about your wife's arthritis. It must be so painful for her, physically and emotionally. You act like she chose it, just to justify asking you to help her.  Guess what? I bet a million internet dollars your wife would very much prefer to not have arthritis, and be able to roll burritos.  She didn't leave it for you because she's lazy. She left it for you because she needed help with doing that. Help you told her you'd give her. You should think long and hard about what \"for better or for worse, in sickness and in health\" means as part of marriage vows.", "Grow up and say no when you don\u2019t want to do things. Whether or not your wife should get into these situations is irrelevant\u2014she absolutely should not have to figure out when you mean you\u2019ll actually help and when you just feel too guilty to say no. YTA", "??  YTA! You agreed to helping her. 3 different times. And then you yelled at her for expecting the help you agreed to! The irony of this is completely lost on you haha you\u2019re doing the same thing you\u2019re complaining she is doing.", "YTA you told her you would help despite having no intention of helping. You\u2019re a huge asshole.", "YTA. Why would you agree to help and yell at her when she asks you to help?", "If you didn't want to do it,  you should have said no.\n\nYTA because you agreed while thinking you'd get out of it. Don't be a dick in the future,  just use your words. You yelled at your wife for asking you to do something you told her TWICE you would do. That's not even a question.  Of course that makes YTA", "YTA, stop yelling at your wife. It sounds like you  resent her for her medical condition, which also makes you an A.", "You signed up for it the moment you said yes to helping her. YTA.", "YTA, you literally asked for this. Do you hate your wife or do you enjoy saying yes to help then being a prick about it?", "YTA. How are you a 35 year old adult, and yelling at your wife is a default whenever she asks you to do something you don't want to do? You could've just said you didn't want to without yelling. Be an adult and communicate with her instead of blowing up at her when she can't read your mind. It's perfectly reasonable for her to ask you for help when you had already agreed to help her earlier.", "This is on the border of e s h and y t a, but I think ultimately, YTA, simply because you agreed to help, confirmed that you were going to help, and then yelled at her when she actually expected your help. I agree with you that she shouldn't be signing up for things she can't manage and then  voluntelling you to help her do it. But, you aren't communicating in a reasonable way. You can't agree to help and then lash out when it comes time to roll up your sleeves. You need to sit her down and have a calm conversation about her overextending herself to the point that you have to begrudgingly step in.", "YTA. Say no the first time if that\u2019s your real answer. Screaming at your spouse for expecting you to do what you said you\u2019d do - twice - is fucked up.", "ESH. OP for agreeing more than once and then at the last minute blowing about it. Wife for agreeing to do something she could not do without asking hubby BEFORE she agreed. She basically volunteered him without his OK and only asked him afterwards.", "Dude... if you didn't wanna help roll the burritos, you should have just said no. If this is an ongoing issue that you've been frustrated about, you should have calmly approached your wife and had a civil discussion about it. Saying you'll do something and then yelling when you're expected to do the thing is gross and mean. YTA\n\n(Not to mention she has arthritis, obviously she's going to need more help doing things than she used to! Why are you holding that against her?)", "100% YTA . If you didn\u2019t plan on helping why would you say yes not once but twice? You\u2019re not justified in yelling at your wife when you broke the promise to her", "To quote you to you, \"If you can't do it on your own, don't sign up for it.\" You signed up for rolling burritos by saying you'd roll burritos. When it came time to roll, said burritos, you screamed at your wife...... for asking you to roll the burritos....... that you agreed to roll...... YTA", "You know she has arthritis.  So you should know she wasn't capable of doing the task herself.  Why you thought it would magically get done, I cannot fathom. By your own admission, you knew about this 3 weeks ago, yet did nothing to prevent the last minute pressure. \n\nI am pretty sure you already know the answer to the question.", "he must have thought that he is just a last resort, not someone who will make all the job instead of her...", "And maybe have the words not be in the form of yelling \u2026", "No, if my husband yelled at me I\u2019d be showing him the door. It\u2019s disrespectful and mean.  My first husband who yelled at me is no longer my husband.", "Also, YTA, a big one.", "This is exactly how the story unfolded in my head and couldn\u2019t wait to get to the comments section. \ud83d\ude02 I have to admit I chucked at his response when it was time to do the thing he agreed to do.", "This", "After she asked him if he would do the job because she had arthitis.....", "Wait, but then you wouldn't have an excuse to verbally abuse your wife! Sounds like you got exactly what you wanted out of this situation.", ">I didn\u2019t want to seem like a jerk\n\nAnd yet you keep yelling at her\u2026\u2026", "That makes no sense, I dislike a lot of stuff and still help people I care about doing them, because I care about them. If a friend asks if I help them moving for example, they don't assume I like it, they ask if I am willing to do it anyway. \n\nShe probably knew you didn't WANT to help her, but you agreed to anyway despite of it, so how should she know, that you never planned on helping in the first place?! It's not like something changed.", "Sounds like you don't like your wife either. YTA", "So\u2026 What you are telling us is that you are of the opinion your wife should know you are a liar who can\u2019t be trusted to tell the truth or follow through on his word? Cause that seems to be what you are telling us. \n\nWeird\u2026 that\u2019s not a thing I\u2019d want my partner to \u201cknow\u201d about me. YTA. \n\nThe whole reason she asked the second time was so you could let her know you would really prefer not to help\u2026", "You didn't want to seem like a jerk so instead you ... screamed at your wife for asking for your help?", "You kept saying yes.  She was supposed to magically divine that she can't trust anything that comes out of your mouth because you're a LIAR whose words mean nothing and that you actually meant no?  Cause that's what you're saying here - that's what you're admitting to being.\n\nWords have meaning.  Learn to communicate like a mature adult.  You're way more of an AH for lying and having horsesh\\*\\* communication skills than she is for accepting projects and then asking for help from the person who took vows to be her partner in life.", "Lol well the jerkstore called and they\u2019re looking for ya! \ud83d\ude02", "[removed]", "People aren\u2019t mind readers yo. Say what you do and don\u2019t want. Don\u2019t expect people to just know.", ">but I didn\u2019t want to seem like a jerk\n\nThat ship has sailed.", "Then, use your big boy words to tell her, \u201cNo\u201d.", "Then, use your big boy words to tell her, \u201cNo\u201d.", "Well, you certainly seem like a huge jerk to most of us now. Congrats.\n\nYour wife is trying to do a good thing. And she's trying to involve you in something that matters to her. Ever heard of bonding? She's asking for what is, realistically, an extremely minor amount of effort on your part. And you're yelling at her. \n\nI am thankful you're not part of my life and I am truly hopeful that you learn to be a better, more loving person to your wife.", "Good thing you avoided seeming like a jerk \ud83e\udd23", "Good job not seemingly like a jerk. /s", "So just so we're clear, instead of being honest with your wife because you didn't want to seem like a jerk, you lied to her and then screamed at her for believing you? And then you come here wondering if you did something wrong?\n\nAudacity, thy name is Dramatic-Professor64", "No, she isn't a mind reader.\n\nShe asked you if you would help, you said yes.\n\nThen you decided to yell at her for asking to do the thing you said you would", "So, she really doesn\u2019t force you to help her with her activities does she? In fact, she didn\u2019t force you here either; she asked. TWICE. And you agreed. TWICE. \n\nYTA and you should really treat your wife better. It\u2019s okay that you don\u2019t want to help her roll the burritos. It\u2019s not okay to just say yes and hope she doesn\u2019t then actually expect/rely on you. It\u2019s not okay to scream at her for something you agreed to do.\n\nPlease take a look into why you\u2019re so angry. This really doesn\u2019t feel like a yelling scenario.", "Wooooooow you are a terrible husband.", "YTA but mostly just like a bad human? I do stuff I don\u2019t want to or like to do literally all the time for the people I love.  It is exhausting but it\u2019s not so exhausting that it is debilitating and if it is I just tell them that truthfully and they reassure me it\u2019s not a big deal and ask someone else.", "I also imagine she does this because it makes her feel useful when she\u2019s literally disabled at 35. It\u2019s beyond horrible to feel like you\u2019re not contributing to anything. If she can cook *most* of the meals independently help a friend eat well *and* have something to do it sounds like a good thing for her. She asked for help with one thing and you said yes to helping her. Don\u2019t agree *multiple times* if you\u2019re not actually willing to help", "Julienne!

Yelling is not the way to communicate. You also are so lucky to not be in debilitating pain and having to rely on others for things you feel like you should be able to do.
