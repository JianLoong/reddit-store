It sounds like at this point her vices have caught up with her.  Addicts usually keep spiraling downwards until they hit rock bottom, or they die.  When change is less painful than continuing on as normal, they can change.  Prison can be quite painful psychologically.  \n\nI believe you would be TA if you paid her bail.  Not only will you never see that money again, you would be enabling her bad behavior.  Paying her bail is removing the consequences for her actions, and your mother will likely go right back to her alcoholism because there isn't a meaningful impetus to change.", "NTA, she's right where she belongs", "NTA, and not for everyone else's reasons.

If you want to get rid of $5000 in a more efficient manner, you could shred it, burn it or throw it to the wind. Your mother should reap the consequences of her actions. If you invest $5000 in her bail, then she is out once again to defraud other people, and continue on with other crimes.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't bail her out.  \n\nBut if you want the help her, maybe swing by wherever she's been staying to see about collecting any of her valuables/keepsakes.\n\nNine months in jail, she will be losing everything.", "NTA.

They didn\u2019t give me money or pick me up from jail. And at the time I was furious but I am now forever grateful they handled it in that way. Your mom may not get sober. She may not stay stopped. But you don\u2019t have to take on her alcoholism and the consequences it produces for her. \n\nSide note: a program called Alanon is extremely helpful in dealing with these situations and I highly recommend it.", "NTA. You need to worry about you and your family. This could be the wake-up call she needs to get sober. I have beet through this with my brother.", "NTA. You have a lifetime of evidence proving she won't stay sober and you'll probably lose your money.  Keep your money; she's more likely to get clean in jail.", "NTA.  9 months in jail could wind up the best thing that has ever happened to her.  Not to mention that especially as she has stolen from you, bailing her out is not your burden.", "NTA \n\nAnd purely for the fact that you don\u2019t have the money without using all your savings.

If you truly want to help her maybe look into a lawyer who can arrange a mandatory rehab stay in exchange for leniency, but honestly I wouldn\u2019t do anything. \n\nShe has for your entire life it sounds put alcohol above everything else. Tell her this is what happens when people do that. They push away friends and family and burn bridges, and that makes people not want to help.", "NTA \nA very similar thing just happened between my mother and brother, except my brother was the one in jail and my mother is the one he takes advantage of. \n\nThis is one thing I've learned (Different people in our situations, I know, but she sounds kind of similar to my brother but a lesser extent) is that if you bail her out, no matter how you feel, you will be an enabler of her actions and poor choices. Bailing her out is not going to show her to be a better person, rather that her family will bail her out of tough situations when she actually deserves to take accountability for her actions. \n\nI've struggled with the same thought as you, but you can't help someone better their life if they aren't willing to put in the work. \n\nMy mother was an enabler of my brother for for a very, very long time. Partially due to that, my brother has been trained to think that if he tries to manipulate, guilt trip, lie or just show up without asking, my mother will do whatever he wants. Imagine his reaction after we've told him no for the last year. It hasn't been pretty, but he finally has left us alone for now. \n\nYou haven't spoken to her in 3 years, and now she expects you to bail her out with a grand total of 5k? That is entitled and disrespectful of her. There is a reason you didn't speak, and I wouldn't let her being in jail change that, because if she is in jail, she clearly has not changed.", "NTA.   \nFollow your brother's lead and do NOT put the money up - you will lose it. If your mom is an alcoholic with no treatment options or supports to keep her sober, she will breach her release conditions and you will be the one that pays the financial consequence. \n\nUnfortunately, as hard is it feels, she has made her bed and needs to face the reality. \n\nWe cannot fix things for other people - hopefully this 9 months helps keep her sober, she seeks some sort of treatment, or alcoholics support network, while incarcerated.", "NTA- look at this like Tough Love for an addict. Hopefully she will dry out while in the clink, do some self-reflection on her trash behavior, and come out a better person.", "NTA.  Her bad choices would continue to drag you down and not just you anymore,  your husband would also need a say in this choice.", "NTA, she burned the bridges and is responsible for her own actions, hopefully she can get her shit together, bailing her out might reduce the chances of that, either way you're not the asshole whether you bail her out or not\n\nEdit; after reading further info you 100% would be the asshole if you bailed her out", "NTA- DO NOT BAIL HER OUT!  You will lose in the end. If you are so dense as to put up your house as collateral and she fails to show up at court, guess what. YOU LOSE YOUR HOUSE.  The bail bonds men they keep the money you give them toward the bail. Let her sit in jail. There is a reason for the saying... If you can't do the time. Don't  do the crime.", "NTA. The point of rock bottom is to climb your way out when you are ready. If someone keeps offering you an elevator ride up, you have no reason to stop jumping back into the hole.", "NTA  please do not bail out your mother- she's not going to change and you could lose your bond money if she jumps bail or owes the lawyers ( that happened to my nephew bailing his brother out). In jail she'll have to dry out and who knows what will happen - maybe this will get her to change her behavior.
