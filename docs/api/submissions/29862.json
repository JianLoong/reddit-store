However, for reasons I\u2019m not sure of, my mom got full custody of me and my younger brother and we were never allowed to see our dad. He tried for years to gain some level of custody of us but it never worked out, even though both my brother and I openly begged to see him, we were never allowed and it strained our relationship with our mother horribly. \n\nMy mother almost instantly remarried to this horrible jerk, let\u2019s call him Clyde. Clyde doesn\u2019t work. He\u2019s a man child who doesn\u2019t clean, plays video games all day, and bosses everyone around. My mom struggles to pay rent on her own, but won\u2019t get rid of this loser no matter how bad he treats her or her kids. By the time I was 13, living with her was pure hell and we never spoke unless we fought. It got so bad that back in January, my mother suggested I emancipate when I turn 16 in a few months, as she no longer wanted to deal with me and didn\u2019t want me around. \n\nCut to about a month ago, my dad died. And it was very sad and I was heartbroken. But we later found out my dad had very large insurance policies, 401k\u2019s, his house, and savings. Everything he had all left to me. He was a hard worker, and a saver who knew how to invest. Everything he had was left to me, with my paternal grandmother acting as a custodian until I am 18, or no longer under the legal control of my mother. I won\u2019t say exactly how much it is, but it\u2019s more money than anyone needs in a lifetime. \n\nSince this discovery, and my unwillingness to halt my emancipation process, my mother has begun pleading with me daily to give her money from the inheritance, and suggest we move into my fathers home, which I now own. Over my dead body would I ever let my mothers husband step foot in my fathers house. And I told her I would not give her so much as a dime unless she divorced that abusive scumbag and got her life back on track. She refused. And so did I.

Anyone else think a call to CPS would be in order seeing as OP describes living there as hell?", "NTA- \n\nLet's assume that you don't literally have people holding this in trust AKA you absolutely do... You have paternal grandparents who ARE NOT going to approve of a withdrawal to pay her bills.... \n\nYou absolutely should not agree to be supporting your adult mother in the off chance that she gives you access to a sibling.

The entire time denying you sibling access and staying with this dude anyway.", "NTA. NTA. NTA. Do not give her a cent over your dead body.\n\nStart recording her actions. Contact relevant authorities and if you wish CPS to get your brother placed with kin (paternal grandparents) or you when you are emancipated or 18. She has threatened both of you, so you are within your full rights.", "NTA she is emotionally blackmailing you by holding your brother hostage. Do not give into her demands because she sounds like the type of person that if you give her an inch, she will take a mile. \n\nIf you can proceed with emancipation, I would do that and get yourself into a safer living space. If you can get proof of the terrible living conditions while you are still living with her, please document everything and report your mother/stepfather to CPS.\n\nIf they lose custody of your brother, you could petition for custody yourself if you're in a position to do so. He will be a teenager soon and more difficult to control which means he could see you if he chose to. He doesn't have to wait to turn 18 to keep contact with you.", "NTA - OP. I want you to listen very carefully - do not giver her a SINGLE PENNY. When my dad died (my parents were separated since I was a year old) I was your age and my mum was the trustee of the account. She felt no shame in spending over 100k pretty much every single cent of the money and I got blackmailed and threatened to keep it a secret. I cannot stress enough that no matter how bad it gets no good will come if you giving money to this woman. This is a clear path for your future, stay strong\n\nEDIT - the people saying tk record these interactions are spot on. If only for your own sanity in case she tries to gaslight you. Families do F\u2019d up things for money and she\u2019s already proven you\u2019re not her priority by moving in what sounds like an abusive boyfriend", "NTA. Stick to your guns.

You just got your golden ticket away from her and your stepfather.", "NTA\u2026 Encourage your brother to start the emancipation process on his own as well. Help him.

I\u2019d be making sure a trust was set up for him. If not, I\u2019d be letting him know he should emancipate as soon as possible and you will help take care of him while he gets on his feet. If you have a ton of money, I\u2019d probably do a trust anyways, just not as much as if he was also an relative of your dad\u2019s. So basically, either way let him know you will be there for him as soon as he can legally escape. Get him a burner phone.", "NTA- I would never let her see a dime and live rent free in my father's home as well. What kind of abuse is it? If it is a unsafe living condition you can call CPS and get your brother out of that home and possibly he can be put with grandma so you can see him. I am sorry about the loss of your dad.", "NTA but here's the funny part.\n\nBefore you got the inheritance, your chance of emancipation was virtually zero.  No family court judge is going to allow it unless you were completely independent, with enough of an income to feed, house, and clothe yourself.  Not some kid who just doesn't get along with their parents who has a part time fast food job and would be effectively homeless.\n\nHow many kids make something like 30-40 thousand USD on their own by the time they were 16 who wasn't an actor, musician, maybe software developer or something like that?  \n\nNow that you'd have access to that money, now you actually could get emancipated.", "Firstly, I'm sorry you have been through all this. I hope you weren't completely isolated from your dad all that time. Secondly do what's best for you it's an empty threat. She will stay in touch because she won't stop wanting that money. Make sure your brother knows he can come live with you any time, he might want to emancipate too. He might just want to run away from home for a night occasionally. If you can make sure your mum doesn't know the address, this has been the best thing for me as an adult my mum doesnt randomly turn up at my house to yell at me i feel much safer in my home. (it might be too late for this though)\n\nMake sure you don't waste that money though. Try not to live off it alone, savings can disappear on little things very quick. It's your safety net, not an excuse to get the more expensive one or to go to an extra party. It's going to be real easy to waste, especially at your age.", "NTA. Perhaps buy your brother a second cell phone to stay in contact. \n\nYou can always revisit the idea of giving her some money once a year.", "No, YWNBTA. Your mother is a terrible parent and you shouldn't let her get even a toe in the door of your inheritance.\n\nStand your ground.", "NTA\n\nWhen you are old enough to open your own line of credit, freeze it and check it regularly.\n\nMeanwhile learn how to monitor whether your mom is opening credit accounts in your name. Ask your grandmother and lawyer to show you how.", "NTA\n\nBut make sure your brother knows where you are. He will need you.", "NTA. Of course not. But why did you inherit everything?
