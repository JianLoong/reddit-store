Your daughter sounds exhausting and self-centered and honestly, super shallow. Maybe your son doesn't want kids, maybe Debbie doesn't want kids, maybe Debbie can't have kids (or your son). Either way, it is NONE OF GIGI's business. If the only praise she can think of her self-worth is that she can pop babies out unlike Debbie, I am terrified of the conditions those children will grow in.

Bringing a child into the world should never, ever, EVER, be about one upping anyone. I'm not going to say anything about divorce or separation or whatever, but it sounds like you and your wife need to have a real talk about Gigi dealing with the consequences of her actions. Or you'll have to accept that her and her kids (maybe more to come later) will remain with you and your wife for years and years to come. Expecting childcare for free the whole time, no doubt. If that's not something you want you need to put your foot down to your wife now. I'm not saying kick Gigi out, but at the very least put down boundaries and rules to be followed to a T unless she wants to be shown to the door.
