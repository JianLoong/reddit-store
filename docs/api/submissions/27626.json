Both kids were running along in front of her, and one of them almost ran right into my chest (she basically stopped herself just in time and it was really jarring and sudden).\n\nI was definitely taken aback and a little frustrated, and said \"can you watch where you're going?\". I want to clarify that I didn't yell or cuss, but I was irritated. As we walked away, their mom yelled after me \"oh for gods sake, its a child\" and my fiance looked at me in shock and didn't say much for a while afterwards. Nothing else went on, we just kept walking and it didn't escalate into anything else.\n\nWhen we got home it wasn't discussed, but a few days later my fiance came to me and seemed embarrassed about what had happened. I tried to tell her not to be upset because it wasn't to do with her, but her reaction was something I hadn't expected. \n\nAdmittedly I've got a short temper so I tend to snap at people sometimes but I don't want to be an ass. My fiance agreed that the lady's kids had been running somewhat out of control and probably should've been stopped by their mom, but she seems to feel embarrassed and guilty about it whereas I wouldn't have given it much of a second thought in all honesty.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

The right response is to gently move around them, smile and move on.

If the parent isn't paying attention or ignores you, and you think the child is in danger, is the only time it's appropriate to say anything to the kid, gently, and along the lines of \"Hey! Careful, that's a street\" - or whatever gentle redirection is appropriate. \n\nSnapping at a kid in that circumstance is BIG time asshole behavior, and is likely causing your fianc\u00e9 to wonder what kind of partner and parent you'll be.

The kid's age is central here.  There is an age at which your reaction is appropriate, because the kid is self-sufficient enough that they should know better and have some responsibility for their actions.  There's also an age at which it is clearly inappropriate, as it amounts to disciplining someone else's child.  So for example, we can agree that telling off a 3 year old is obviously inappropriate, but its also OK to make your comment to a 15 year old that almost runs into you.  Its hard to say what that line is, but this I know:  the age of 6 falls well on the inappropriate side.  Its barely first grade.  It amounts to parenting and disciplining someone else's child without their consent.  Not OK.", "YTA both for not working on your temper when you know it\u2019s a reoccurring issue \n\nAnd because *you* saw the child running and chose to not get out of the way, presumably because you assume you have the right of way as an adult.\n\nI could also say E-S-H (both you and the mom for not keeping the kids closer to her) but based off the overall scenario, this skews to you.", "YTA.

Yikes! YTA, without a doubt. Would you have chased him down and beat his as if he had *actually* run into you?

There is nothing wrong with asking a child to watch where they're going, especially if the parent isn't addressing the issue. If I was distracted and my child was running around and being disruptive then I don't think I'd take much issue with someone else saying this to my child, within reason. Tone is important and they are not the child's parent, I am, but as long as they aren't being outright rude to my child and don't swear or yell, it's probably going to be fine. Personally, I've had children bump into me in public spaces, I opted to go with a loud but friendly \"excuse me\", which usually alerts the parent to take stock of where their child is, but that may not be everyone's first reaction. To be honest and fair, I probably wouldn't have used that tactic prior to having kids of my own either. \n\nWe live in a society and children are people too. Yes, we should afford children some slack as they are still learning how to be a part of society, but they will never learn if they aren't taught. From what I understood in the OP, nobody was addressing the child's behavior, the OP addressed it in, from what I can tell, a reasonable manner. The girlfriend becoming embarrassed by the situation a few days later does raise some potential red flags and perhaps she saw something in the interaction that the OP isn't entirely aware of. We don't know for sure, but it doesn't sound like the OP was entirely out of line and I don't think it's fair to say \"there is no reason to talk to a child like that\". I think the OP should talk more to his girlfriend and see if she can provide more details and specifics as to why the interaction embarrassed her.", "Yes there is. The child needs to know that they can't just go running about cuz what if next time they actually bump into someone and some bad shit happens. Wording could've been better like \"you need to watch where ur going next time\" but if a small child pelted full speed towards me then stopped suddenly right infront of me while I was walking I'd say somit too\n\nEdit: spelling", "Poor kid was probably scared.", "I lose my temper a lot and its really something I need to work on", "I kind of wonder what the woman would have said if he had been a car instead of a human though\u2026", "I\u2019m amazed at the hypocrisy in so many of these responses.

The words themselves are fine. But I think if it were me, I'll soften my tone deliberately as it's a little kid. Or even change my words to advise the kid to be careful. \n\nAnd also, how my SO interacts with strangers is a huge indicator of whether or not I think he's a person I'd like to build a future with. That's my personal preference. It's possible that OP's SO sees this as how he may potentially interact with their families' kids or future kids.", "I think it's because we're just opposite ends of the spectrum when dealing with stuff like this. She's really non-confrontational whereas I have no issue calling someone out", "I'm loving OP's reactions here. Sorry, gotta retract my previous words.

I feel bad for even making her think she needs to take responsibility for something I did", "It did frustrate me that after her kid ran into me, the lady kind of just had a blank face and kept on walking.

It was out of line", "You're right, completely", "I do understand what you mean", "I certainly found it startling that their mom didn't do a thing but snap at me", "Poor kid", "I agree. I do believe my frustration was aimed at the wrong party", "That's why the reaction from the kid's mom was so incongruous to me. I really wasn't yelling or up in their face or anything close to that. To me it seemed like she was being defensive after knowing she probably shouldn't have let her kids run about on a crowded street like that, honestly", "She\u2019s probably rethinking if kids with him is a good idea if that was their plan", "I have a short temper so snap at people, and I told her not to be upset because it nothing to do with her are both red flags dude.\n\nBe better.", "Also - You can\u2019t tell someone they shouldn\u2019t be upset, not to get upset, or how to feel in general.", "You could have said that because I was confused as well with that statement. That makes it almost seem that you're being untruthful on other things. Saying she almost ran into your groin is fine, and isn't obscene. Your reaction was harsh and you should have spoken to the mother, not the child. Even if the child annoyed you, it isn't your kid.
