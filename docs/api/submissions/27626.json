Both kids were running along in front of her, and one of them almost ran right into my chest (she basically stopped herself just in time and it was really jarring and sudden).\n\nI was definitely taken aback and a little frustrated, and said \"can you watch where you're going?\". I want to clarify that I didn't yell or cuss, but I was irritated. As we walked away, their mom yelled after me \"oh for gods sake, its a child\" and my fiance looked at me in shock and didn't say much for a while afterwards. Nothing else went on, we just kept walking and it didn't escalate into anything else.\n\nWhen we got home it wasn't discussed, but a few days later my fiance came to me and seemed embarrassed about what had happened. I tried to tell her not to be upset because it wasn't to do with her, but her reaction was something I hadn't expected. \n\nAdmittedly I've got a short temper so I tend to snap at people sometimes but I don't want to be an ass. My fiance agreed that the lady's kids had been running somewhat out of control and probably should've been stopped by their mom, but she seems to feel embarrassed and guilty about it whereas I wouldn't have given it much of a second thought in all honesty.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

The right response is to gently move around them, smile and move on.

If the parent isn't paying attention or ignores you, and you think the child is in danger, is the only time it's appropriate to say anything to the kid, gently, and along the lines of \"Hey! Careful, that's a street\" - or whatever gentle redirection is appropriate. \n\nSnapping at a kid in that circumstance is BIG time asshole behavior, and is likely causing your fianc\u00e9 to wonder what kind of partner and parent you'll be.

The kid's age is central here.  There is an age at which your reaction is appropriate, because the kid is self-sufficient enough that they should know better and have some responsibility for their actions.  There's also an age at which it is clearly inappropriate, as it amounts to disciplining someone else's child.  So for example, we can agree that telling off a 3 year old is obviously inappropriate, but its also OK to make your comment to a 15 year old that almost runs into you.  Its hard to say what that line is, but this I know:  the age of 6 falls well on the inappropriate side.  Its barely first grade.  It amounts to parenting and disciplining someone else's child without their consent.  Not OK.", "YTA both for not working on your temper when you know it\u2019s a reoccurring issue \n\nAnd because *you* saw the child running and chose to not get out of the way, presumably because you assume you have the right of way as an adult.\n\nI could also say E-S-H (both you and the mom for not keeping the kids closer to her) but based off the overall scenario, this skews to you.", "YTA.

Tone is important and they are not the child's parent, I am, but as long as they aren't being outright rude to my child and don't swear or yell, it's probably going to be fine. Personally, I've had children bump into me in public spaces, I opted to go with a loud but friendly \"excuse me\", which usually alerts the parent to take stock of where their child is, but that may not be everyone's first reaction. To be honest and fair, I probably wouldn't have used that tactic prior to having kids of my own either. \n\nWe live in a society and children are people too.

You are a threat, period. Just like women have to be on guard at all times for our own safety, we have to do this for our children as well because you never know how someone will react towards your child.

This doesn't make them an abuser or a person of no value. That is despicable.", "They spoke to OP as if he was an adult capable of grasping forthright language. You're getting wound up over a complete non-issue. OP can scream at children in the street, he's certainly capable of facing some forthright language.", "Some people are just sensitive to it lol. \n\nOnce at an airport I was trying to go to an empty checkout counter (there was an employee but no customer). Another employee intercepted me and said to use the self serve machines. It was early days so they weren\u2019t very good, I had been trying for 5 mins and gave up. I said that, and that I was going to the counter. He told me I should use the machine, I tried explaining again. My sister who had also been trying and failing came up to us, but he kept insisting I go back to the machine. So I said \u2018 look the machines suck, I tried 2 different ones, I\u2019m done with this\u2019 and just walked up to the counter where I was promptly checked in. As I walked past him I heard my sister say to the guy trying to stop me \u2018i apologise for my sister\u2019\u2026 looking really embarrassed by my behaviour. \n\nIt really pissed me off honestly. I tried having a civil conversation with the guy, but instead of offering solutions or helping with the machine he just insisted and didn\u2019t listen. I don\u2019t think I was rude to him , unless he built the machines himself. The regular counter was open, and the person there was happy to serve me. And my sister feels like she needs to apologise for me standing my ground. \n\nEpilogue: the machines did suck and everyone ended up having to us the counter, including my sister.\n\nOP I also think it mostly depends on what your tone was. It sounds like you also realise that something pretty neutral to you might feel confrontational to your partner, it\u2019s not going to change", "Question: why is it ok for you to have trouble controlling yourself in public, but not for children or their parents?", "LOL barreling?

The mere existence of this post is because the person came here to ask for advice and see if he's the problem in this situation. He's clearly aware that there's a problem and is trying to figure out how to address it. You are dehumanizing him, accusing him of being an abuser, and that he has no value, based on what I'd guess is projection of your own exposure to cruel people in the past, which I can't blame anyone for, but it's not accurate for shit. Don't let the people who were cruel in your life ever beat you twice, once when they were cruel, and twice when they made you cynical and dehumanize others because of the scars they left.\n\nYes I've had cruel people in my life, narcs and psychos the whole lot. Most people have many times. I've also known several people with anger issues and many couples who avoid topics for days at a time, and problems much worse and with all the information being far more clear - who weren't abusers or people that needed to be immediately discarded.
