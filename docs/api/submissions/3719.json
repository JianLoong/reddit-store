{"id": 3719, "submission_id": "za4g2s", "title": "AITA for sitting with another girl while watching a movie?", "selftext": "I (29M) have been with my fiancee (28F) for 5 years. We had just purchased a home together in September. My Fiancee, Gigi, has a friend, Chelsea (26F), who she met through work. I would consider them being good friends since Gigi has asked her to be a bridesmaid. However, the last few months Gigi has been cold to Chelsea stating that Chelsea has been talking behind her back and tried to sabotage Gigi's promotion. However, Chelsea is cool and I enjoy talking to her. I don't think she would do this.\n\nChelsea and I often talk on Snapchat. We both enjoy working out, watching movies, and have gotten really close. When I have had issues with Gigi, I have turned to Chelsea who has always listened to me and validated my feelings.\n\nChelsea and I decided that we would have a movie day. We planned it weeks in advanced and I mentioned it to Gigi on Friday that Chelsea would come over with drinks on Saturday. Gigi was not very happy so I did not mention that I had planned it for weeks. The thing about Gigi is that she does not drink. Chelsea and I enjoy craft beers so we both ended up bringing craft beers to the house. Gigi was more than welcome to watch movies with us.\n\nWhile we were watching movies, I sat next to Chelsea the entire time. Chelsea had her legs over me and I had my hands on her legs or knee. At one point, we both got cold and I threw a blanket over us. I did fall asleep, as I sometimes do. Gigi at no point told me to move next to her. Instead, she sat at the other end of the couch under a blanket alone.\n\nChelsea eventually went home. I was happy to get to spend that time with a friend. When we went to go to bed, Gigi accused me of being an AH for, in her words, cuddling with Chelsea while watching movies. I am saying we did not cuddle, but simply sat next to each other the whole time. We have been arguing about it for days and Chelsea does not see what went wrong and does not think of me being an AH. My friends also agree with me. However, I need an outsider's perspective. Gigi is not talking to me at this moment.

We had just purchased a home together in September. My Fiancee, G, has a friend, C (26F), who she met through work. I would consider them being good friends since G has asked her to be a bridesmaid. However, the last few months G has been cold to C stating that C has been talking behind her back and tried to sabotage G's promotion. However, C is cool and I enjoy talking to her. I don't think she would do this. \n\nC and I often talk on Snapchat. We both enjoy working out, watching movies, and have gotten really close. When I have had issues with G, I have turned to C who has always listened to me and validated my feelings. \n\nC and I decided that we would have a movie day. We planned it weeks in advanced and I mentioned it to G on Friday that C would come over with drinks on Saturday. G was not very happy so I did not mention that I had planned it for weeks. The thing about G is that she does not drink. C and I enjoy craft beers so we both ended up bringing craft beers to the house. G was more than welcome to watch movies with us. \n\nWhile we were watching movies, I sat next to C the entire time. C had her legs over me and I had my hands on her legs or knee. At one point, we both got cold and I threw a blanket over us. I did fall asleep, as I sometimes do. G at no point told me to move next to her. Instead, she sat at the other end of the couch under a blanket alone. \n\nC eventually went home. I was happy to get to spend that time with a friend. When we went to go to bed, G accused me of being an AH. We have been arguing about it for days and C does not see what went wrong and does not think of me being an AH. My friends also agree with me. However, I need an outsider's perspective. G is not talking to me at this moment. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

WTF is wrong with you two? This friendship/relationship is completely inappropriate. You\u2019re basically dating this girl and prioritizing her above your relationship.

No ifs, ands, or buts about it. \n\nOP, not only are YTA but you're about to be a single asshole who has to either sell his new house or buy out his ex-fiancee. Or will Chelsea buy her out and just move right in? \n\nIf you care about Gigi at all, you'll dump Chelsea's \"friendship\" without a second thought.
