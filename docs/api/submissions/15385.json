When he was eight I started dating my current husband. On the day my son met his stepbrother they stood in front of each other, sized each other up the way little boys do, and were silent for a moment. Then my son asked \"do you want to play Smash Bros?\" and his stepbrother said yes, and then ran upstairs. It was fraternal love at first sight. They've been attached at the hip ever since.\u00a0\n\nMy stepson's mother passed a few years ago, and my husband was actually reticent to introduce me and my son to his two kids, because he thought it was too soon. It turns out that where some kids get a pet after a parent dies, my stepson and stepdaughter got a brother. The first year we were all together my stepson asked if my son could come along when they visited their mother at the cemetery on her birthday, and he spent the whole car ride over telling my son all about her, and it seemed therapeutic for him. Later that night I checked in and saw that my son had climbed up to the top bunk and they had fallen asleep curled up together. Before she entered her current 7-going-on-17 phase my stepdaughter used to crawl into my son's lap as often as she did my stepson and ask them to read to her.\u00a0\n\nSince the divorce my ex husband has been unreliable at best. He cancels on my son regularly, making some excuse about work or what have you. The twice monthly weekend together have trailed off to the or four times a year. Every time I have to tell my son his father cancelled, my stepson goes to his father and asks if the three of them can do something together.\u00a0\n\nOne of the few things my ex husband likes enough to always follow through with is camping. He's planning on taking my son to the Poconos in a few weeks the weekend after Father's Day weekend. My son lives camping as well, and he's the one who convinced my stepson to join Boy Scouts next fall. The thing is, this year he wants to bring his stepbrother along.\u00a0\n\nI told my ex husband this and he got upset, saying that it's their time together and he doesn't want someone else's kid along with them. He says that it's supposed to be the two of them bonding. I told him he's had plenty of chances to bond that he blew off for one reason or another, and that he should consider himself lucky that he has such a compassionate and sensitive son and that our son still wants anything to do with him. He hung up on a huff. His mother called yesterday to complain that I was expecting my ex to just sit their while my son and stepson went off on their own and ignored my ex completely, and said that I need to look at it from his perspective since he only \"gets\" to see our son a few times a year. For obvious reasons this annoyed me to the point where I hung up. My husband says that he gets it and thinks I should let it just be the two of them.

Your ex is too but don't send a kid on a camping trip where the supervising adult doesn't want them there. If your son decides he doesn't want to go without his stepbrother then so be it, dad will have to deal. But I don't think you should play rainmaker with the camping trip", "YTA- He wants time with his son and just his son which is completely fair because he\u2019s not in a parental role in any capacity for your stepson. He\u2019s not required to welcome your stepson in with open arms just because you would like it, or your son would like it. \n\nHe set a very fair and reasonable boundary, so you need to respect that.", "YTA.  Not for asking, but for pushing it.  Your ex CAN say no.", "ESH, sorry.\n\nI understand you, but you made a mistake. Your son is 11 years old. He's still a child, but he's old enough that he could've asked his father about inviting his stepbrother along himself. And that would've been the right thing to do. Regardless of whether his father's answer would've been the same or not, it should've been his son asking since he's the one who wanted to bring the other boy.\n\nYou inserted yourself in the situation and took the chance to throw jabs at your ex for his absent fatherhood. And your ex is right, though: the dynamic of the trip would significantly change if the stepbrother joined. No doubt they could have a great time, but it would no longer be a bonding, father and son trip. Furthermore, your ex isn't obligated to bring someone else's child anywhere. He was asked and he declined. You pushing and arguing was out of line.\n\nYour husband is able to see this, why don't you? He basically told you to butt out and let them have the trip the way it was planned, the way your ex decided it. This is pretty basic, but it's solid advice.\n\nP.S: The ESH is because your ex is an AH for dropping the ball with his own son. And because he should be focusing more on the fact his son has lost connection with him so much that he prefers to bring a friend rather than spending time alone with him, instead he's involved in a petty fight with you.", "NAH, you can ask but don't push it.

Instead of making it a big deal, I'd just tell your son \"dad wants it to be just the two of you\" and let him make a decision for himself when he's old enough how much he prioritizes a dad who won't even let his brother who he loves come along once. Also congrats on this beautiful blended family situation. Everything apart from your ex-husband warmed the absolute fuck out of my heart.", "ESH but mostly YTA. He shouldn\u2019t be blowing off your son, but you pushing it about the stepbrother going on this trip as well (and then trying to throw all this in Dad\u2019s face) was out of line. The flakiness of Dad is a separate issue from him not wanting to hang out with Stepbrother. \n\nESH because Dad\u2019s being a jerk to your son about not following through with consistent quality time, but he\u2019s NOT being a jerk about not wanting stepbrother present during the time he is participating in. Overall YTA.", "YTA - But I understand where you're coming from. Your son loves his Step-Brother and want to do these things with him. However ex only wants to spend time with your son though, because your Step-son is not his responsibility.\n\nYou have no right to push it, let your son make his own decisions. Considering how uncommitted your ex is, there is a good chance he'll stop going with your ex and instead try organizing trips with his Step-Brother instead in the future.", "NAH. It's great that the boys have bonded and you are being a good parent to both kids. But since the dad is unreliable, he needs to bond with his son as mentioned. And he has every right to say no. Did you offer to pay for your stepson? \n\nPerhaps in a couple of years that will change. For now, think of ways to keep the stepkids occupied while your son is with his dad.", "YTA\n\nNot for asking, but for arguing when he gave you his answer.", "[deleted]", "NAH. Your intentions for wanting to include your stepson are understandable, however, your ex-husband wants to have some one-on-one bonding time with his son, and that's also a valid desire. While it's true that your ex hasn't been as consistent as he should be, this camping trip could be an opportunity for them to connect. It might be best to let them have their father-son time on this trip, and then encourage your son and stepson to have their own adventure together on a separate occasion.", "I say NTA because your son actually wants his stepbrother to come along. I can see the different view points but I\u2019d consider the child\u2019s most of all.", "ESH sorry to say, you asked and he said no so that\u2019s that. He\u2019s an AH for not making time with his child, and he needs to be better. My advice don\u2019t push it, leave it alone. Maybe your husband, could take both of the kids out camping another time. Let this your son and his Dad.", "Not TA for asking, but YTA for going knives out trying to push it.\n\nNo one wants a surprise additional kid, and no father, regardless of how absentee they might be, deserves to have what precious little one on one time they have taken from them. That is what it is, and your ex is right about that.

Take your stepson and son camping sometime soon. As a family.", "NTA for asking since your son asked you to.", "NTA- you only asked this of your ex because your son wants his step bro to go. Your ex is insecure with his father-son relationship and it shows, but that's his own fault like you stated. The least he could do is make this trip the most enjoyable for his son. Exes feelings should be hurt by a kids leaving him out cuz wtf does he think his son feels everytime his father cancels.", "I don't think it was AH to ask. But I do think everything past his no was.", "NTA. But let this just be your son and your ex this time if thats what your son wants.\nIf your ex was involved in your life and spent time with your current partner and kids id say call him out for excluding your stepson. \nUnless your new partner is going to go along for the trip I think it could be a horrible experience for your stepson.if your ex doesn't want him there he may go out of his way to exclude him and be noticeable cold and dismissive of your stepson. Dont put a child into a possibly damaging situation.", "NTA\n\nYou are just reiterating something that your son wants. \nIf your ex was really concerned about spending time with him then he would be putting in more effort to do just that. I wonder if he would be as upset if it was just a friend from school as oppose to your step son?", "NTA, because it is what your son wants. All your ex is doing is pushing his son away from himself.", "The kid was asked if he wanted to go without his brother. Don't make him leave. Ex is a part time dad but brother is not.", "NTA ask the kid if he wants to go without his brother. Don\u2019t make him go. Ex is a part time dad but brother isn\u2019t.", "Sounds like your son would feel more comfortable with his brother along since his father is becoming a stranger to him. Time for kids is not like time for adults, a month is much more significant and your ex is failing him massively by not showing up.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the place to ask this question because you\u2019re going to get roasted. Being a parent is more complicated than that.\n\nNTA", "Nope. NTA. there is no such thing has half or step siblings and if the adults in their life don't get that, that adult is the AH. \n\nYou did good and those kids will always know it and appreciate. \n\nWe're family in this home.", "NTA. Yeah you have to let it go but I know how crappy it is when an ex doesn\u2019t care enough to spend much time with their own child. Your son sounds like a great kid as well as your step kids. It\u2019s normal for him to want to bring his brother but I wouldn\u2019t trust your ex with him. Camping with your husband and the two boys sounds like a much better alternative.", "NTA. This amid a discussion between the son and his father.  It\u2019s not for you to be the bad guy and say no here. \n\nIf the son wants to bring the step brother he should ask the father and the father should decide.  I don\u2019t see why you would be involved.  \n\nI think your role ends by telling your Ex that the son wants step bro to come.

Taking this into account, I think it's ridiculous to create more difficulties in the situation.\n\nWe can debate how morally right the dad is, or face the fact of who he is, and it's highly unlikely the camping trips will continue if he's made to take the stepson. Any honest evaluation of the advantage to the kid would acknowledge that if we want him to have a relationship with the dad, dad needs to have agency in the trip. Fair or not, following every request of the kid or not. Dad being a half assed parent doesn't mean he must be forced to do every little thing his kid wants in the time they are together.\n\nAnd finally, frankly, I don't blame him in not wanting to take the stepson with.

The kid is old enough to ask themselves and I think mom telling kid she'd ask is only getting the their hopes up for something she knows isn't going to happen in the first place", "NTA. I had to go back and reread it to see if I missed something, since I could not understand why so many are saying she's the AH. Everyone is saying she's the AH for not considering the absent father's feelings and desire to \"bond\" with the son alone, and that she \"pushed things\" and tried to \"guilt trip\" him. \n\n\"I told my ex husband this and he got upset, saying that it's their time together and he doesn't want someone else's kid along with them. He says that it's supposed to be the two of them bonding. I told him he's had plenty of chances to bond that he blew off for one reason or another, and that he should consider himself lucky that he has such a compassionate and sensitive son and that our son still wants anything to do with him. He hung up on a huff.\" \n\nThat doesn't sound like pushing things to me. She stated her son's desire, he got upset, she continued advocating for her son's desire while giving him the facts. He HAS been a flake and HAS had plenty of opportunities to bond with his son, and maybe if he spent any time with his son he would know that this isn't just \"someone else's kid\" but his son's BROTHER (yes, the child of her new husband so I can see how he might be a bit uncomfortable but they'd been divorced for 2 years when she started dating new husband, so she didn\u2019t cheat on him with this guy, there shouldn't be such bad blood between them that he can't handle a child). His son IS compassionate for wanting to share a fun activity with his closest friend who shares the same interest. And the ex SHOULD be grateful that the son is still young and kind enough to want to spend time with him; if he keeps dropping the ball, soon the son will just give up. He just didn't want to face the truth so cried to his own mother. Sounds like he has responsibility issues. It also doesn't say that she brought it up again to him after this, but that it was his mother called to bring it up again and complain. \n\nFurthermore, people are focusing on the father's desires when they should be focusing on the child's. I wonder why the kid feels the need to have his friend around during this trip. Is it possible that a dad that isn't physically present might not be emotionally present when he actually shows up and the kid wants someone there that he can have a good time with? And he can still bond with his kid while his friend/brother is there. He's the adult, both kids are going to depend on him and learn from him on the trip either way, they won't be able to just run \"off on their own and ignore [her] ex completely\" like grandma thinks. Sharing this experience would just make it more enriching and give him someone to reminisce with after the trip is over since it clearly sounds like dad won't be there. \n\nAnd to those who say that OP should of had her son talk to daddy-dearest to explain his wishes, he is ELEVEN. If his grown-a** man of a father (I'm assuming 30-40s since the adults' ages weren't given) can't handle a conversation and a few truths without asking his mom to call and make it better, then what makes you think his CHILD should. Esp. when it sounds like the father/son don't have a close enough relationship to have conversations about feelings. So yeah, he asked his mother to ask his dad if his friend could come along. It wasn't her responsibility to force her child onto the phone and listen to his reasoning (re: bitching), he is the one that hung up, he could have asked to speak to his son and explain. \n\nAnyway, NTA. Though I agree with the new husband and the redditers that say to not continue pushing it, it doesn't sound like she did after ex hung up; esp. since I question ex's ability to care for 1 child, let alone 2.", "NTA - Your son is doing what 11yr olds do. If it wasn't his step brother it would be a friend that he wanted to bring along. Why? Because he has got used to being let down by his dad and the idea of backup is appealing.

I was a very anxious preteen with divorced parents and lived several states away from my Dad. My Dad adored me and my brother and was present best he could be. He had us 4 weeks out of the year and always took time off to get the most out of it.

The few times I did want to talk to him, I always had my Mom call him for me.\n\nHave we considered there is more behind the boys bonds? They have spent almost half of their lives together and some of that has been through grief. It took a lot of trust for the one kid to open up about his deceased mother. If OP's son is as caring and sensitive as described, maybe he feels worried or guilty. He has an alive bio father who's barely present. The other kid had a great mom who he loved dearly. As OP's kid ages, and sees his brother rightly as his brother, maybe something like this is at the back of his mind. Or some variation of it. Grief and love work in weird ways.

He told ex what his boundary was and what he needed (which was actually very little- he wanted bio-dad to call him once a week to say hi and to send him a birthday card...... he's never given him a birthday card/ gift or Christmas gift or anything in his entire life). He told ex that if he couldn't do that then he didn't want him in his life. We never heard from bio-dad again.", "Not so sure ESH.  He certainly does but all she did was call him on his bullshit.

He is the one will be paying for them and is in charge. If he says no the answer is no. Ops comments after have nothing to do with her stepson and seem questionable and unnecessary.\n\nEdit: INFO. After reading some comments it\u2019s got me thinking. How far away dose your ex live? When y\u2019all split was it bad or good? And what dose he do for work? Reddit is very biased when it comes to moms. However I wanna get the full picture. Is he actually a dead beat like you say, or is he legitimately busy and/or has trouble seeing your son for legitimate reasons. I\u2019m also curious about the \u201climited visits\u201d and what dose that mean. Is he only allowed to see your son at certain times? Why?", "Regardless of the history, he has a right to not want to take an extra child, the question came from you, you want a break from kids, didn\u2019t come from your son, selfish move, YTA", "ESH.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with asking, but you need to respect his answer. Asking someone who only parents one child a handful of times a year to suddenly be responsible for two children for an extended period of time is a lot to ask. Even if the lack of parenting is his choice and even if the kids are the most responsible and well behaved children to ever walk the earth. That\u2019s more food to buy, more things to pack, more people to keep an eye on. It\u2019s double what he initially signed up for. Does he even know your stepson? If your son only sees him a few times a year, I\u2019m guessing your ex has had very little interaction with your stepson.

While OP has a great situation with blending her family, there is a responsibility to her son to help maintain the bond with her ex even though he is not reliable.  Good parenting means doing what's right for your kid regardless of your personal feelings about an ex.  Of course her kid wants to take along step-brother.

Your Ex is the A H most of the time for past actions with his history of flaking out.  You are not the A H for asking but he is also not an A H for saying no.  You should explain to your son why it\u2019s important to try and bond with his biological father despite the history as this could be the trip that turns things around.  Is it likely? No of course not but that doesn\u2019t mean you should try and force a change to the dynamic of the whole trip by trying to make him take the stepson along.", "I've had to deal with my son asking \"does Dad hate me?' on more than one occasion. It's hard not to be hostile after that. He was a flake before we got divorced.", "Why her husband, girls don\u2019t camp?  Always as many moms as dads when I go camping.", "Why can\u2019t mom take them camping? Last I checked, camping did not require a Y chromosome.", "Why does it have to be the husband? Can't Mom go camping?", "Nah, my dad used to bring my step sisters on father son trips because I wanted them to. He did just me and my brother stuff too, but he went out of his way to make sure I had fun with my step sisters because he cared about me.", "I melted at him telling his brother all about his mum. That's just adorable and so important that he gets to share who his mum was. OP and her husband have raised some lovely kids there."]}
