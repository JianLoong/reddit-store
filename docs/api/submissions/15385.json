{"id": 15385, "submission_id": "12utku5", "title": "AITA for asking my ex if our son (11) could bring his stepbrother (also 11) on their father son camping trip?", "selftext": "My ex and I got a divorce when our son was six. When he was eight I started dating my current husband. On the day my son met his stepbrother they stood in front of each other, sized each other up the way little boys do, and were silent for a moment. Then my son asked \"do you want to play Smash Bros?\" and his stepbrother said yes, and then ran upstairs. It was fraternal love at first sight. They've been attached at the hip ever since.\u00a0\n\nMy stepson's mother passed a few years ago, and my husband was actually reticent to introduce me and my son to his two kids, because he thought it was too soon. It turns out that where some kids get a pet after a parent dies, my stepson and stepdaughter got a brother. The first year we were all together my stepson asked if my son could come along when they visited their mother at the cemetery on her birthday, and he spent the whole car ride over telling my son all about her, and it seemed therapeutic for him. Later that night I checked in and saw that my son had climbed up to the top bunk and they had fallen asleep curled up together. Before she entered her current 7-going-on-17 phase my stepdaughter used to crawl into my son's lap as often as she did my stepson and ask them to read to her.\u00a0\n\nSince the divorce my ex husband has been unreliable at best. He cancels on my son regularly, making some excuse about work or what have you. The twice monthly weekend together have trailed off to the or four times a year. Every time I have to tell my son his father cancelled, my stepson goes to his father and asks if the three of them can do something together.\u00a0\n\nOne of the few things my ex husband likes enough to always follow through with is camping. He's planning on taking my son to the Poconos in a few weeks the weekend after Father's Day weekend. My son lives camping as well, and he's the one who convinced my stepson to join Boy Scouts next fall. The thing is, this year he wants to bring his stepbrother along.\u00a0\n\nI told my ex husband this and he got upset, saying that it's their time together and he doesn't want someone else's kid along with them. He says that it's supposed to be the two of them bonding. I told him he's had plenty of chances to bond that he blew off for one reason or another, and that he should consider himself lucky that he has such a compassionate and sensitive son and that our son still wants anything to do with him. He hung up on a huff. His mother called yesterday to complain that I was expecting my ex to just sit their while my son and stepson went off on their own and ignored my ex completely, and said that I need to look at it from his perspective since he only \"gets\" to see our son a few times a year. For obvious reasons this annoyed me to the point where I hung up. My husband says that he gets it and thinks I should let it just be the two of them.

Not for asking, but for pushing it.  Your ex CAN say no.", "ESH, sorry.\n\nI understand you, but you made a mistake. Your son is 11 years old. He's still a child, but he's old enough that he could've asked his father about inviting his stepbrother along himself. And that would've been the right thing to do. Regardless of whether his father's answer would've been the same or not, it should've been his son asking since he's the one who wanted to bring the other boy.\n\nYou inserted yourself in the situation and took the chance to throw jabs at your ex for his absent fatherhood. And your ex is right, though: the dynamic of the trip would significantly change if the stepbrother joined. No doubt they could have a great time, but it would no longer be a bonding, father and son trip. Furthermore, your ex isn't obligated to bring someone else's child anywhere. He was asked and he declined. You pushing and arguing was out of line.\n\nYour husband is able to see this, why don't you? He basically told you to butt out and let them have the trip the way it was planned, the way your ex decided it. This is pretty basic, but it's solid advice.\n\nP.S: The ESH is because your ex is an AH for dropping the ball with his own son. And because he should be focusing more on the fact his son has lost connection with him so much that he prefers to bring a friend rather than spending time alone with him, instead he's involved in a petty fight with you.", "NAH, you can ask but don't push it.

He shouldn\u2019t be blowing off your son, but you pushing it about the stepbrother going on this trip as well (and then trying to throw all this in Dad\u2019s face) was out of line. The flakiness of Dad is a separate issue from him not wanting to hang out with Stepbrother. \n\nESH because Dad\u2019s being a jerk to your son about not following through with consistent quality time, but he\u2019s NOT being a jerk about not wanting stepbrother present during the time he is participating in. Overall YTA.", "YTA - But I understand where you're coming from. Your son loves his Step-Brother and want to do these things with him. However ex only wants to spend time with your son though, because your Step-son is not his responsibility.\n\nYou have no right to push it, let your son make his own decisions. Considering how uncommitted your ex is, there is a good chance he'll stop going with your ex and instead try organizing trips with his Step-Brother instead in the future.", "NAH. It's great that the boys have bonded and you are being a good parent to both kids. But since the dad is unreliable, he needs to bond with his son as mentioned. And he has every right to say no. Did you offer to pay for your stepson? \n\nPerhaps in a couple of years that will change. For now, think of ways to keep the stepkids occupied while your son is with his dad.", "YTA\n\nNot for asking, but for arguing when he gave you his answer.", "YTA    People say \"it's fine to ask\" but in this case you knew what the outcome would be. You asked on behalf of your son when you knew your ex wanted one on one time with him. You damned well knew your ex was not going to take your new husband's child camping. The only purpose in asking was to show your son, once again, what a sad sack his father is. This may make you feel better but it is NOT helpful to your son.", "NAH. Your intentions for wanting to include your stepson are understandable, however, your ex-husband wants to have some one-on-one bonding time with his son, and that's also a valid desire. While it's true that your ex hasn't been as consistent as he should be, this camping trip could be an opportunity for them to connect. It might be best to let them have their father-son time on this trip, and then encourage your son and stepson to have their own adventure together on a separate occasion.", "I say NTA because your son actually wants his stepbrother to come along. I can see the different view points but I\u2019d consider the child\u2019s most of all.", "ESH sorry to say, you asked and he said no so that\u2019s that. He\u2019s an AH for not making time with his child, and he needs to be better. My advice don\u2019t push it, leave it alone. Maybe your husband, could take both of the kids out camping another time. Let this your son and his Dad.", "Not TA for asking, but YTA for going knives out trying to push it.\n\nNo one wants a surprise additional kid, and no father, regardless of how absentee they might be, deserves to have what precious little one on one time they have taken from them. That is what it is, and your ex is right about that. Bring along your stepson and it becomes a brother bonding trip not a father son bonding trip.\n\nTake a deep breath and recognize the wins you have already. Take your stepson and son camping sometime soon. As a family.", "NTA for asking since your son asked you to.", "NTA- you only asked this of your ex because your son wants his step bro to go. Your ex is insecure with his father-son relationship and it shows, but that's his own fault like you stated. The least he could do is make this trip the most enjoyable for his son. Exes feelings should be hurt by a kids leaving him out cuz wtf does he think his son feels everytime his father cancels.", "I don't think it was AH to ask. But I do think everything past his no was.", "NTA. But let this just be your son and your ex this time if thats what your son wants.\nIf your ex was involved in your life and spent time with your current partner and kids id say call him out for excluding your stepson. \nUnless your new partner is going to go along for the trip I think it could be a horrible experience for your stepson.if your ex doesn't want him there he may go out of his way to exclude him and be noticeable cold and dismissive of your stepson. Dont put a child into a possibly damaging situation.", "NTA\n\nYou are just reiterating something that your son wants. \nIf your ex was really concerned about spending time with him then he would be putting in more effort to do just that. I wonder if he would be as upset if it was just a friend from school as oppose to your step son?", "NTA, because it is what your son wants. All your ex is doing is pushing his son away from himself.", "The kid was asked if he wanted to go without his brother. Don't make him leave. Ex is a part time dad but brother is not.", "NTA ask the kid if he wants to go without his brother. Don\u2019t make him go. Ex is a part time dad but brother isn\u2019t.", "Sounds like your son would feel more comfortable with his brother along since his father is becoming a stranger to him. Time for kids is not like time for adults, a month is much more significant and your ex is failing him massively by not showing up.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the place to ask this question because you\u2019re going to get roasted. Being a parent is more complicated than that.\n\nNTA", "Nope. NTA. there is no such thing has half or step siblings and if the adults in their life don't get that, that adult is the AH. \n\nYou did good and those kids will always know it and appreciate. \n\nWe're family in this home.", "NTA. Yeah you have to let it go but I know how crappy it is when an ex doesn\u2019t care enough to spend much time with their own child. Your son sounds like a great kid as well as your step kids. It\u2019s normal for him to want to bring his brother but I wouldn\u2019t trust your ex with him. Camping with your husband and the two boys sounds like a much better alternative.", "NTA. This amid a discussion between the son and his father.  It\u2019s not for you to be the bad guy and say no here. \n\nIf the son wants to bring the step brother he should ask the father and the father should decide.  I don\u2019t see why you would be involved.  \n\nI think your role ends by telling your Ex that the son wants step bro to come.

Taking this into account, I think it's ridiculous to create more difficulties in the situation.\n\nWe can debate how morally right the dad is, or face the fact of who he is, and it's highly unlikely the camping trips will continue if he's made to take the stepson. Any honest evaluation of the advantage to the kid would acknowledge that if we want him to have a relationship with the dad, dad needs to have agency in the trip. Fair or not, following every request of the kid or not. Dad being a half assed parent doesn't mean he must be forced to do every little thing his kid wants in the time they are together.\n\nAnd finally, frankly, I don't blame him in not wanting to take the stepson with.

That's life sometimes. Calm down.", "No disagreement that it should be on the ex to say no to his son. I think mom should have told the son to ask his father and stayed out of it. The kid is old enough to ask themselves and I think mom telling kid she'd ask is only getting the their hopes up for something she knows isn't going to happen in the first place", "NTA. I had to go back and reread it to see if I missed something, since I could not understand why so many are saying she's the AH. Everyone is saying she's the AH for not considering the absent father's feelings and desire to \"bond\" with the son alone, and that she \"pushed things\" and tried to \"guilt trip\" him. \n\n\"I told my ex husband this and he got upset, saying that it's their time together and he doesn't want someone else's kid along with them. He says that it's supposed to be the two of them bonding. I told him he's had plenty of chances to bond that he blew off for one reason or another, and that he should consider himself lucky that he has such a compassionate and sensitive son and that our son still wants anything to do with him. He hung up on a huff.\" \n\nThat doesn't sound like pushing things to me. She stated her son's desire, he got upset, she continued advocating for her son's desire while giving him the facts. He HAS been a flake and HAS had plenty of opportunities to bond with his son, and maybe if he spent any time with his son he would know that this isn't just \"someone else's kid\" but his son's BROTHER (yes, the child of her new husband so I can see how he might be a bit uncomfortable but they'd been divorced for 2 years when she started dating new husband, so she didn\u2019t cheat on him with this guy, there shouldn't be such bad blood between them that he can't handle a child). His son IS compassionate for wanting to share a fun activity with his closest friend who shares the same interest. And the ex SHOULD be grateful that the son is still young and kind enough to want to spend time with him; if he keeps dropping the ball, soon the son will just give up. He just didn't want to face the truth so cried to his own mother. Sounds like he has responsibility issues. It also doesn't say that she brought it up again to him after this, but that it was his mother called to bring it up again and complain. \n\nFurthermore, people are focusing on the father's desires when they should be focusing on the child's. I wonder why the kid feels the need to have his friend around during this trip. Is it possible that a dad that isn't physically present might not be emotionally present when he actually shows up and the kid wants someone there that he can have a good time with? And he can still bond with his kid while his friend/brother is there. He's the adult, both kids are going to depend on him and learn from him on the trip either way, they won't be able to just run \"off on their own and ignore [her] ex completely\" like grandma thinks. Sharing this experience would just make it more enriching and give him someone to reminisce with after the trip is over since it clearly sounds like dad won't be there. \n\nAnd to those who say that OP should of had her son talk to daddy-dearest to explain his wishes, he is ELEVEN. If his grown-a** man of a father (I'm assuming 30-40s since the adults' ages weren't given) can't handle a conversation and a few truths without asking his mom to call and make it better, then what makes you think his CHILD should. Esp. when it sounds like the father/son don't have a close enough relationship to have conversations about feelings. So yeah, he asked his mother to ask his dad if his friend could come along. It wasn't her responsibility to force her child onto the phone and listen to his reasoning (re: bitching), he is the one that hung up, he could have asked to speak to his son and explain. \n\nAnyway, NTA. Though I agree with the new husband and the redditers that say to not continue pushing it, it doesn't sound like she did after ex hung up; esp. since I question ex's ability to care for 1 child, let alone 2.", "NTA - Your son is doing what 11yr olds do. If it wasn't his step brother it would be a friend that he wanted to bring along. Why? Because he has got used to being let down by his dad and the idea of backup is appealing.

You did mis a chance to set his mother straight, though.  You should have said he has a lot of visitation options, but your ex is always busy doing other things and chooses not to be with his son.  Your ex MIL seems to have been fed a story where you are keeping his son away from your ex.  This doesn't seem to be the truth at all.", "I'm going in NTA because your son asked and you relayed the request. While I totally agree that your ex is generally being a shifty parent, I can't fault him for wanting a father son camping trip. \n\nI feel like YWBTA if you insisted any further. \nPersonally, idk if I would have Stepson go. EX is totally going to resent it, and you don't want a kid to have to deal with that. \n\nI'd arrange another camping trip later.", "ESH while I sort of understand the dad's sentiment, the kid is about the age when they want to bring friends along these kind of outings. Now the stepbrother is the friend. The big question is whether your ex would behave this way if this was a random friend or a neighbor. In any case, I hope that he does not alienate his son. You cannot force this, have a separate more awesome trip for the family.", "I dont think you are the ah for asking. Your son asked to take stepbrother with him. This is someone he cares deeply about and wanted to share it with his dad. One important person meeting another important person. You were trying to protect your kids and honestly sounds like you are just so fed up with your ex that you snapped.\n\nI agree though once he said no, even if it took everything in you, probably should have hung up and raged into a pillow or something. I would have explained the situation to your son with the truth. \"Dad said no.\" And then from there it opens the door for your son to ask his dad and let his dad defend himself. If dad wants to build bonds with his son, he has to have these conversations and be honest with the kid. And your son deserves to know the truth from his dad, the good and the ugly. The closer your son and stepbrother become the more his dads just going to have to learn that maybe at some points they will come as a package deal, his son might come to points where he doesnt want to do stuff without his stepbrother. His son might start pulling away if he sees his dads hostilities come through. We dont know. But if the bond with his son is that important to him he will have to learn the stepbrother is apart of him now. And this is stuff where his dad needs to make the choice to step up and accept those in his sons life or fight it and risk everything.\n\nBut he shouldnt have run to mummy to fight his battles for him either. Thats some weak behaviour there.  \n\n\nSo i wont hand out a yes or a no to are you. Its a tough situation.", "Did the red pill brigade get a misogyny bat signal when this post went up?

Your son is just about old enough to decide if he even wants to keep seeing his sperm donor.", "NTA. Your son is the one that wanted to bring his stepbrother, and you were advocating for your son's wishes. The ex is clearly gaslighting by stating he only gets to see his son a few times a year, implying you are withholding visits, when he is constantly blowing him off. He also didn't have to send his mother to come down on you, which seems to be a sort of back you in the corner tactic. You didn't send your husband to come down on him, nor did you send anyone else so that's downright cruel. I will say your ex has every right not to bring your stepson, but that doesn't make you the bad guy for advocating for what your son wanted when he seems to be constantly crapped on by his father. You are still his mother at the end of the day, and you have every right to speak your opinions. He clearly didn't withhold his, so I'm not sure why everyone is upset that you didn't withhold yours.", "In this case I'm gonna say NTA.

Anyway, your son asked and he probably would feel better with his brother than this sanctioned trip with his dad who bails all the time.", "You're both A.\n\nHim for not being around for his kid amd constantly blowing him off.\n\nBut you for forcing this situation.

You just told the ex what your son wanted.", "ESH except for the kids. Your ex is an absentee father who's expecting not to face consequences. You're pushing a third party to a parent-child bonding trip. Your stepson has been covering for your husband's irresponsibility but he's not his son.", "You're not an asshole for asking.

I'd be annoyed too, he's been neglecting his son so much and then getting upset about this of all things, his attitude could be improved imo. I do agree with OP, her son seems to be way more understanding and forgiving than his dad, and not to be rude, but probably more emotionally mature too. \n\nPeople commenting \"he should have asked his dad\" and how OP \"inserted herself\" into the situation - I'd like to know how often does the kid even get to talk to his dad on the phone. I would have liked to see his reaction if his son asked. if it was a best friend from school, not stepbrother, would he still refuse? if his son got upset at being told no, would he get mad at him? \n\nthe ONLY thing I can excuse him for is not wanting to be responsible for a child on an overnight trip, and hey, he could, as a decent parent who cares about his kid, recommend that they go to the cinema the three of them next weekend or smth. but it doesn't sound like he cares about his kid all that much.", "It's like r/incel was alerted to this post. I fear the men on Reddit aren't sending their best", "I disagree. Ex seems to only want a conditional relationship with his son on his own terms. Flaky and unreliable. If son wants to bring along someone who he\u2019s clearly emotionally attached to, I would press for them to be together too. I frankly understand why! Step brother has kind of stepped in whenever father flaked.\n\nLet the ex have the conversation directly with the son. Especially since dad seems like an emotionally unreliable parent. \nEither he will realise he\u2019s trying to separate two friends and back down, or OP\u2019s son will realised ex is being self centered and let the thing go, and it will colour their relationship as it should. \n\nAnd If it\u2019s a matter of just finances, OP can surely cover it.", "NTA.

Father was similar to the one in this post and I still have trauma from having to ask him questions myself and getting blunt hurtfull answers.\n\nWhen my mom asked him stuff, she told me his answer (no) in a more child-friendly way while he made me feel like I am the worst for even asking. I don\u2018t know if that is the case here but it is something to keep in mind.\n\nAlso in my situations, I would have loved to have a (step)sibling that I could take with me to not be alone with my dad.
