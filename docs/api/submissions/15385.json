When he was eight I started dating my current husband. On the day my son met his stepbrother they stood in front of each other, sized each other up the way little boys do, and were silent for a moment. Then my son asked \"do you want to play Smash Bros?\" and his stepbrother said yes, and then ran upstairs. It was fraternal love at first sight. They've been attached at the hip ever since.\u00a0\n\nMy stepson's mother passed a few years ago, and my husband was actually reticent to introduce me and my son to his two kids, because he thought it was too soon. It turns out that where some kids get a pet after a parent dies, my stepson and stepdaughter got a brother. The first year we were all together my stepson asked if my son could come along when they visited their mother at the cemetery on her birthday, and he spent the whole car ride over telling my son all about her, and it seemed therapeutic for him. Later that night I checked in and saw that my son had climbed up to the top bunk and they had fallen asleep curled up together. Before she entered her current 7-going-on-17 phase my stepdaughter used to crawl into my son's lap as often as she did my stepson and ask them to read to her.\u00a0\n\nSince the divorce my ex husband has been unreliable at best. He cancels on my son regularly, making some excuse about work or what have you. The twice monthly weekend together have trailed off to the or four times a year. Every time I have to tell my son his father cancelled, my stepson goes to his father and asks if the three of them can do something together.\u00a0\n\nOne of the few things my ex husband likes enough to always follow through with is camping. He's planning on taking my son to the Poconos in a few weeks the weekend after Father's Day weekend. My son lives camping as well, and he's the one who convinced my stepson to join Boy Scouts next fall. The thing is, this year he wants to bring his stepbrother along.\u00a0\n\nI told my ex husband this and he got upset, saying that it's their time together and he doesn't want someone else's kid along with them. He says that it's supposed to be the two of them bonding. I told him he's had plenty of chances to bond that he blew off for one reason or another, and that he should consider himself lucky that he has such a compassionate and sensitive son and that our son still wants anything to do with him. He hung up on a huff. His mother called yesterday to complain that I was expecting my ex to just sit their while my son and stepson went off on their own and ignored my ex completely, and said that I need to look at it from his perspective since he only \"gets\" to see our son a few times a year. For obvious reasons this annoyed me to the point where I hung up. My husband says that he gets it and thinks I should let it just be the two of them.

He's still a child, but he's old enough that he could've asked his father about inviting his stepbrother along himself. And that would've been the right thing to do. Regardless of whether his father's answer would've been the same or not, it should've been his son asking since he's the one who wanted to bring the other boy.\n\nYou inserted yourself in the situation and took the chance to throw jabs at your ex for his absent fatherhood. And your ex is right, though: the dynamic of the trip would significantly change if the stepbrother joined. No doubt they could have a great time, but it would no longer be a bonding, father and son trip. Furthermore, your ex isn't obligated to bring someone else's child anywhere. He was asked and he declined. You pushing and arguing was out of line.\n\nYour husband is able to see this, why don't you? He basically told you to butt out and let them have the trip the way it was planned, the way your ex decided it. This is pretty basic, but it's solid advice.\n\nP.S: The ESH is because your ex is an AH for dropping the ball with his own son.

He shouldn\u2019t be blowing off your son, but you pushing it about the stepbrother going on this trip as well (and then trying to throw all this in Dad\u2019s face) was out of line.

It's great that the boys have bonded and you are being a good parent to both kids. But since the dad is unreliable, he needs to bond with his son as mentioned. And he has every right to say no.

Your intentions for wanting to include your stepson are understandable, however, your ex-husband wants to have some one-on-one bonding time with his son, and that's also a valid desire.

It might be best to let them have their father-son time on this trip, and then encourage your son and stepson to have their own adventure together on a separate occasion.", "I say NTA because your son actually wants his stepbrother to come along.

Exes feelings should be hurt by a kids leaving him out cuz wtf does he think his son feels everytime his father cancels.", "I don't think it was AH to ask. But I do think everything past his no was.", "NTA. But let this just be your son and your ex this time if thats what your son wants.\nIf your ex was involved in your life and spent time with your current partner and kids id say call him out for excluding your stepson. \nUnless your new partner is going to go along for the trip I think it could be a horrible experience for your stepson.if your ex doesn't want him there he may go out of his way to exclude him and be noticeable cold and dismissive of your stepson. Dont put a child into a possibly damaging situation.", "NTA\n\nYou are just reiterating something that your son wants. \nIf your ex was really concerned about spending time with him then he would be putting in more effort to do just that.

Time for kids is not like time for adults, a month is much more significant and your ex is failing him massively by not showing up.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the place to ask this question because you\u2019re going to get roasted. Being a parent is more complicated than that.\n\nNTA", "Nope. NTA. there is no such thing has half or step siblings and if the adults in their life don't get that, that adult is the AH. \n\nYou did good and those kids will always know it and appreciate. \n\nWe're family in this home.", "NTA. Yeah you have to let it go but I know how crappy it is when an ex doesn\u2019t care enough to spend much time with their own child. Your son sounds like a great kid as well as your step kids. It\u2019s normal for him to want to bring his brother but I wouldn\u2019t trust your ex with him. Camping with your husband and the two boys sounds like a much better alternative.", "NTA. This amid a discussion between the son and his father.  It\u2019s not for you to be the bad guy and say no here. \n\nIf the son wants to bring the step brother he should ask the father and the father should decide.  I don\u2019t see why you would be involved.  \n\nI think your role ends by telling your Ex that the son wants step bro to come.

Taking this into account, I think it's ridiculous to create more difficulties in the situation.\n\nWe can debate how morally right the dad is, or face the fact of who he is, and it's highly unlikely the camping trips will continue if he's made to take the stepson. Any honest evaluation of the advantage to the kid would acknowledge that if we want him to have a relationship with the dad, dad needs to have agency in the trip. Fair or not, following every request of the kid or not. Dad being a half assed parent doesn't mean he must be forced to do every little thing his kid wants in the time they are together.\n\nAnd finally, frankly, I don't blame him in not wanting to take the stepson with.

The kid is old enough to ask themselves and I think mom telling kid she'd ask is only getting the their hopes up for something she knows isn't going to happen in the first place", "NTA. I had to go back and reread it to see if I missed something, since I could not understand why so many are saying she's the AH. Everyone is saying she's the AH for not considering the absent father's feelings and desire to \"bond\" with the son alone, and that she \"pushed things\" and tried to \"guilt trip\" him. \n\n\"I told my ex husband this and he got upset, saying that it's their time together and he doesn't want someone else's kid along with them. He says that it's supposed to be the two of them bonding. I told him he's had plenty of chances to bond that he blew off for one reason or another, and that he should consider himself lucky that he has such a compassionate and sensitive son and that our son still wants anything to do with him. He hung up on a huff.\" \n\nThat doesn't sound like pushing things to me. She stated her son's desire, he got upset, she continued advocating for her son's desire while giving him the facts. He HAS been a flake and HAS had plenty of opportunities to bond with his son, and maybe if he spent any time with his son he would know that this isn't just \"someone else's kid\" but his son's BROTHER (yes, the child of her new husband so I can see how he might be a bit uncomfortable but they'd been divorced for 2 years when she started dating new husband, so she didn\u2019t cheat on him with this guy, there shouldn't be such bad blood between them that he can't handle a child). His son IS compassionate for wanting to share a fun activity with his closest friend who shares the same interest. And the ex SHOULD be grateful that the son is still young and kind enough to want to spend time with him; if he keeps dropping the ball, soon the son will just give up. He just didn't want to face the truth so cried to his own mother. Sounds like he has responsibility issues. It also doesn't say that she brought it up again to him after this, but that it was his mother called to bring it up again and complain. \n\nFurthermore, people are focusing on the father's desires when they should be focusing on the child's. I wonder why the kid feels the need to have his friend around during this trip. Is it possible that a dad that isn't physically present might not be emotionally present when he actually shows up and the kid wants someone there that he can have a good time with? And he can still bond with his kid while his friend/brother is there. He's the adult, both kids are going to depend on him and learn from him on the trip either way, they won't be able to just run \"off on their own and ignore [her] ex completely\" like grandma thinks. Sharing this experience would just make it more enriching and give him someone to reminisce with after the trip is over since it clearly sounds like dad won't be there. \n\nAnd to those who say that OP should of had her son talk to daddy-dearest to explain his wishes, he is ELEVEN. If his grown-a** man of a father (I'm assuming 30-40s since the adults' ages weren't given) can't handle a conversation and a few truths without asking his mom to call and make it better, then what makes you think his CHILD should. Esp. when it sounds like the father/son don't have a close enough relationship to have conversations about feelings. So yeah, he asked his mother to ask his dad if his friend could come along. It wasn't her responsibility to force her child onto the phone and listen to his reasoning (re: bitching), he is the one that hung up, he could have asked to speak to his son and explain. \n\nAnyway, NTA.

If the only \"bonding time\" he's willing to do with his son is on his terms and otherwise he doesn't show interest in his son, it doesn't really help his case.\n\nMom is allowed to be human.  She shouldn't be expected to be super human just to soothe this man's ego.", "It does when he uses the excuse of wanting to have bonding time. But if he took the time to bond normally he could make his kid happy by letting him bring his stepbrother...", "That\u2019s a fair point but kids are always fine after the initial sadness and have fun anyways. Agree to disagree but I don\u2019t think you should just do what a kid wants because they\u2019ll throw a tantrum otherwise.  I see why you might do it if it\u2019s infrequent though.", "That\u2019s a lot of assumptions that I don\u2019t see in the post so we\u2019re clearly looking at it differently. \n\nOP says the son loves camping and the dad does too. They do it every single year alone already. Son loves camping so much that he\u2019s getting stepbrother to join scouts this year. Nowhere in there does it sound like what you said at all.  You\u2019ve created a different story and are expressing how you\u2019d feel and I agree that if he was being forced then it would suck. But it sounds like he enjoys it without someone else too. \n\nAnd I agree that it\u2019s not a big deal asking to bring a friend but it\u2019s also not a big deal to say no. Taking your own kid somewhere is one thing but taking another kid that isn\u2019t yours is a whole other level and not something every adult would want.", "Right but your comment is that she should have accepted No, so while maybe, her son is still young and so she tried to shield him from the hurt by arguing the point. As a mom, I get that. NTA!", "Maybe it was today's \"word of the day\" on the toilet paper.", "which is what i said in other comments and in the one you responded to, depending on where she is at, she may not be able to revoke visitation.\n\nedit: word", "No one is treating the deadbeat like shit,she's just not rewarding him for being worthless like you stupidly think she should, \n\nLet me guess ,you're a deadbeat too,and your butthurt you weren't rewarded for doing basically nothing", "At least he\u2019s reading."]}
