{"id": 15385, "submission_id": "12utku5", "title": "AITA for asking my ex if our son (11) could bring his stepbrother (also 11) on their father son camping trip?", "selftext": "My ex and I got a divorce when our son was six. When he was eight I started dating my current husband. On the day my son met his stepbrother they stood in front of each other, sized each other up the way little boys do, and were silent for a moment. Then my son asked \"do you want to play Smash Bros?\" and his stepbrother said yes, and then ran upstairs. It was fraternal love at first sight. They've been attached at the hip ever since.\u00a0\n\nMy stepson's mother passed a few years ago, and my husband was actually reticent to introduce me and my son to his two kids, because he thought it was too soon. It turns out that where some kids get a pet after a parent dies, my stepson and stepdaughter got a brother. The first year we were all together my stepson asked if my son could come along when they visited their mother at the cemetery on her birthday, and he spent the whole car ride over telling my son all about her, and it seemed therapeutic for him. Later that night I checked in and saw that my son had climbed up to the top bunk and they had fallen asleep curled up together. Before she entered her current 7-going-on-17 phase my stepdaughter used to crawl into my son's lap as often as she did my stepson and ask them to read to her.\u00a0\n\nSince the divorce my ex husband has been unreliable at best. He cancels on my son regularly, making some excuse about work or what have you. The twice monthly weekend together have trailed off to the or four times a year. Every time I have to tell my son his father cancelled, my stepson goes to his father and asks if the three of them can do something together.\u00a0\n\nOne of the few things my ex husband likes enough to always follow through with is camping. He's planning on taking my son to the Poconos in a few weeks the weekend after Father's Day weekend. My son lives camping as well, and he's the one who convinced my stepson to join Boy Scouts next fall. The thing is, this year he wants to bring his stepbrother along.\u00a0\n\nI told my ex husband this and he got upset, saying that it's their time together and he doesn't want someone else's kid along with them. He says that it's supposed to be the two of them bonding. I told him he's had plenty of chances to bond that he blew off for one reason or another, and that he should consider himself lucky that he has such a compassionate and sensitive son and that our son still wants anything to do with him. He hung up on a huff. His mother called yesterday to complain that I was expecting my ex to just sit their while my son and stepson went off on their own and ignored my ex completely, and said that I need to look at it from his perspective since he only \"gets\" to see our son a few times a year. For obvious reasons this annoyed me to the point where I hung up. My husband says that he gets it and thinks I should let it just be the two of them.

Not for asking, but for pushing it.  Your ex CAN say no.", "ESH, sorry.\n\nI understand you, but you made a mistake. Your son is 11 years old. He's still a child, but he's old enough that he could've asked his father about inviting his stepbrother along himself. And that would've been the right thing to do. Regardless of whether his father's answer would've been the same or not, it should've been his son asking since he's the one who wanted to bring the other boy.\n\nYou inserted yourself in the situation and took the chance to throw jabs at your ex for his absent fatherhood. And your ex is right, though: the dynamic of the trip would significantly change if the stepbrother joined. No doubt they could have a great time, but it would no longer be a bonding, father and son trip. Furthermore, your ex isn't obligated to bring someone else's child anywhere. He was asked and he declined. You pushing and arguing was out of line.\n\nYour husband is able to see this, why don't you? He basically told you to butt out and let them have the trip the way it was planned, the way your ex decided it. This is pretty basic, but it's solid advice.\n\nP.S: The ESH is because your ex is an AH for dropping the ball with his own son. And because he should be focusing more on the fact his son has lost connection with him so much that he prefers to bring a friend rather than spending time alone with him, instead he's involved in a petty fight with you.", "NAH, you can ask but don't push it.

He shouldn\u2019t be blowing off your son, but you pushing it about the stepbrother going on this trip as well (and then trying to throw all this in Dad\u2019s face) was out of line. The flakiness of Dad is a separate issue from him not wanting to hang out with Stepbrother. \n\nESH because Dad\u2019s being a jerk to your son about not following through with consistent quality time, but he\u2019s NOT being a jerk about not wanting stepbrother present during the time he is participating in. Overall YTA.", "YTA - But I understand where you're coming from. Your son loves his Step-Brother and want to do these things with him. However ex only wants to spend time with your son though, because your Step-son is not his responsibility.\n\nYou have no right to push it, let your son make his own decisions. Considering how uncommitted your ex is, there is a good chance he'll stop going with your ex and instead try organizing trips with his Step-Brother instead in the future.", "NAH. It's great that the boys have bonded and you are being a good parent to both kids. But since the dad is unreliable, he needs to bond with his son as mentioned. And he has every right to say no. Did you offer to pay for your stepson? \n\nPerhaps in a couple of years that will change. For now, think of ways to keep the stepkids occupied while your son is with his dad.", "YTA\n\nNot for asking, but for arguing when he gave you his answer.", "YTA    People say \"it's fine to ask\" but in this case you knew what the outcome would be. You asked on behalf of your son when you knew your ex wanted one on one time with him. You damned well knew your ex was not going to take your new husband's child camping. The only purpose in asking was to show your son, once again, what a sad sack his father is. This may make you feel better but it is NOT helpful to your son.", "NAH. Your intentions for wanting to include your stepson are understandable, however, your ex-husband wants to have some one-on-one bonding time with his son, and that's also a valid desire. While it's true that your ex hasn't been as consistent as he should be, this camping trip could be an opportunity for them to connect. It might be best to let them have their father-son time on this trip, and then encourage your son and stepson to have their own adventure together on a separate occasion.", "I say NTA because your son actually wants his stepbrother to come along. I can see the different view points but I\u2019d consider the child\u2019s most of all.", "ESH sorry to say, you asked and he said no so that\u2019s that. He\u2019s an AH for not making time with his child, and he needs to be better. My advice don\u2019t push it, leave it alone. Maybe your husband, could take both of the kids out camping another time. Let this your son and his Dad.", "Not TA for asking, but YTA for going knives out trying to push it.\n\nNo one wants a surprise additional kid, and no father, regardless of how absentee they might be, deserves to have what precious little one on one time they have taken from them. That is what it is, and your ex is right about that. Bring along your stepson and it becomes a brother bonding trip not a father son bonding trip.\n\nTake a deep breath and recognize the wins you have already. Take your stepson and son camping sometime soon. As a family.", "NTA for asking since your son asked you to.", "NTA- you only asked this of your ex because your son wants his step bro to go. Your ex is insecure with his father-son relationship and it shows, but that's his own fault like you stated. The least he could do is make this trip the most enjoyable for his son. Exes feelings should be hurt by a kids leaving him out cuz wtf does he think his son feels everytime his father cancels.", "I don't think it was AH to ask. But I do think everything past his no was.", "NTA. But let this just be your son and your ex this time if thats what your son wants.\nIf your ex was involved in your life and spent time with your current partner and kids id say call him out for excluding your stepson. \nUnless your new partner is going to go along for the trip I think it could be a horrible experience for your stepson.if your ex doesn't want him there he may go out of his way to exclude him and be noticeable cold and dismissive of your stepson. Dont put a child into a possibly damaging situation.", "NTA\n\nYou are just reiterating something that your son wants. \nIf your ex was really concerned about spending time with him then he would be putting in more effort to do just that. I wonder if he would be as upset if it was just a friend from school as oppose to your step son?", "NTA, because it is what your son wants. All your ex is doing is pushing his son away from himself.", "The kid was asked if he wanted to go without his brother. Don't make him leave. Ex is a part time dad but brother is not.", "NTA ask the kid if he wants to go without his brother. Don\u2019t make him go. Ex is a part time dad but brother isn\u2019t.", "Sounds like your son would feel more comfortable with his brother along since his father is becoming a stranger to him. Time for kids is not like time for adults, a month is much more significant and your ex is failing him massively by not showing up.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the place to ask this question because you\u2019re going to get roasted. Being a parent is more complicated than that.\n\nNTA", "Nope. NTA. there is no such thing has half or step siblings and if the adults in their life don't get that, that adult is the AH. \n\nYou did good and those kids will always know it and appreciate. \n\nWe're family in this home.", "NTA. Yeah you have to let it go but I know how crappy it is when an ex doesn\u2019t care enough to spend much time with their own child. Your son sounds like a great kid as well as your step kids. It\u2019s normal for him to want to bring his brother but I wouldn\u2019t trust your ex with him. Camping with your husband and the two boys sounds like a much better alternative.", "NTA. This amid a discussion between the son and his father.  It\u2019s not for you to be the bad guy and say no here. \n\nIf the son wants to bring the step brother he should ask the father and the father should decide.  I don\u2019t see why you would be involved.  \n\nI think your role ends by telling your Ex that the son wants step bro to come.

But your original decision of sending your step kid along was completely unreasonable and unfair to all of the 3 involved.", "I've had to answer the question \"does Dad hate me?\" on a few occasions after he cancelled at the last minute. I don't need to *make* him look bad.", "I get that. Putting it lightly, ex doesn't exactly sound like the ideal co-parent. Which again, makes it seem like you even asking is preposterous and why I'm questioning the motive", "Is the ex really busy or he just doesn\u2019t want to see his son?", "You just learned that word right ?", "Why\u2019s it on the mom to say no to her son.  Why can\u2019t the ex explain he wants it to be just the two of them.  The mom just relayed the ask here and now she gets shit on", "It is absolutly irrelevant if he is busy or not. He is a father and he has an obligation to his son. If it happens once that he cancels short notice it can be overlooked. If it happens multiple times he is just an ass.", "Dude chill I was just wondering though I ain\u2019t making an argument\ud83d\ude2d.", "I see both sides of this. I think the only real AH is the MIL. As for the rest,kid 1 wants to include kid 2. Mom is merely messenger but frustrated with ex. (completely understandable) Ex wants time with his kid (totally reasonable) and not have kid 2 along. (also totally reasonable)\n\nI really think that dad needs to talk to son. Ask him how he feels about the situation and also explain his position.\n\nMIL needs to mind her own business.\n\nI say, Mom NTA, Dad NTA, MIL TTA\n\nCOMMUNICATE PEOPLE, FFS.", "YTA. Don\u2019t force it ffs this is how the bigger problems start", "YTA", "YTA you asked he said no, that's the end of it.", "YTA obviously", "YTA no is a full sentence.", "You can ASK, but to be fair, it goes against father-son time and may be hard for the father to deal with the other man's kid.  So it is unlikely he would say yes.", "YTA", "NTA. Your son is such a compassionate young man and you should be proud of the love your blended family shares. Too bad it hasn't rubbed off onto your ex.", "NTA... However... Why would you send your son with someone so unreliable? I have a son who isn't biologically mine. His dad was the same as your ex. Eventually, my son cut him off due to being let down so much. My daughter, his sister has met the guy before, but I didn't like him taking his biological son because he was a fuck up. My daughter that I have say over, I would never allow to go with someone I vsnt trust.", "NTA. I don't understand people commenting that you should of just accepted his \"No\" when that's clearly not all he said. I don't blame you for not having the perfect response to his fit.", "NTA. All you did is ask.\nIf he was any different and by that I mean decent, he'd take the other boy on the trip too.\n\nDespite your ex being selfish, It was refreshing to read that kids get along well.", "I'm going to go with NTA because you asked at **your son's request**. Your son wanted to invite his stepbrother and you followed through with the ask. The minute your ex said no, that should have been it. \n\nI get that you were upset by him using \"bonding\" with his son as an excuse to say no, but he is under no obligation \u2014 legally or morally \u2014 to take your stepson with him anywhere for any reason. And, given how flippant he has been with visitation, you shouldn't want him anywhere near your stepson if he can't even muster up any care and/concern for how skipping visitation has been affecting *his* son.", "NTA. Your son wanted his brother to go with him.", "I'll take all the downvotes for this but NTA. \n\nHe gets 2 times a month visit and only shows up 3-4 times a year. Plus he constantly cancels up in him. He obviously does not care for the emotions of his son. The only reason he goes on a camping trip with his son is because he likes it. It just seems it's all about him. Not his son. \n\nI agree that camping trip is a bonding time between him and his son. And you know what the son wants??? For his Step Bro to be there. Not a parent but as someone who actually has a much younger cousin who i wanted to bond with, the best way I've been able to do that is by engaging myself in activities which she likes and a lot of times it's not just us but with folks she loves too. And you can see how much she lights up when i used to do that. This made her like me and this is what made her approach me. Because she saw me respecting and loving people that she loved too. As adults our idea of what will be fun is different then their idea and at the end of the day I wanted her to have a good time and make good memories. It's all those things that brought us closer. \n\nIt just feels like the ex just wants to do everything the way he likes and doesn't take into consideration what others like or want from this trip. Not even his own son. \n\nIf the son asks it every single time, maybe the ex can talk to him and say no. But this seems like the first time and I'm sorry but i just don't get why the reaction needs to be this harsh. \n\nNTA. You were just advocating for what your son wants. And if he wants to say no, he should be the one trying to explain the son and telling him. He sounds like someone who wants to be a fun uncle and not a father. You suck up your own desire and keep your kid first.\n\nEdit : The ex just wants to do whatever he wants ( camping ) and get the parenting thing done as well. Kill 2 birds with one arrow. He's really terrible. \n\nAlso, to all the folks saying OP is the AH here. No she really isn't. She is simply relaying the information. She didn't decide on her own that it's unfair for the step kid and therefore both of them should go. The kid requested this all on his own. She just passed that information to dad. Not sure why he's so mad about it. If he doesn't want it, tell that to the kid on your own. He just wants to be a fun uncle and look cool and OP here is always being the one who disappoints the kid and handles dropping the bad news.", "NTA.\n\nAnd for those who disagree, his son wants to invite his stepbrother, an admirable trait \n\nMaybe theres a reason son wants to invite his stepbro.\n\nDads a drag? Or maybe son wants to show off his dad to his bro?\n\nEither way, this isn't cutting into bonding time, it adds to it.\n\nOtherwise, if son finds out his dad doesn't want the stepbro to go, it damn sure isn't going to make it better.\n\nAnd chances are he will find out or figure it out.\n\nSo don't force it, otherwise you and your ex would suck as parents.", "YTA. (A soft one). \n\nBackstory is fucked, but regardless he has a right to say no.  Leave it at that. Let dad, once they are on their trip, explain it himself to your kid. Because of what happend it will now be a topic between them. Let them talk about themselfs. Maybe dad wasn't the best dad, maybe there is a lot more to the story than we know. But I get that he wants to do this with his son. Let it be. The kids are joint to the hip... they will survive some time apart.", "Soft YTA. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard being your sons only consistent bio parent and you want him to enjoy his time and you know he\u2019ll enjoy it most with stepbrother there. But this is his dads time, and if he doesn\u2019t want to take another child that isn\u2019t his, that\u2019s his right. Sucks that he doesn\u2019t care to actually bond with him as much as he could, but your son deserves the 1 on 1 bonding he does get. I\u2019m sure as he gets older he\u2019ll see his dad for who he really is and he\u2019ll be less excited for the camping trips but for now, he gets to enjoy them and I\u2019m sure once he\u2019s on the trip, he\u2019ll have a great time and he gets to tell his brother about it once he\u2019s home. Plus, your stepson would be more comfortable on a camping trip with his dad and bro rather than bro and bros dad because there\u2019s a chance that your ex may show his distaste for him being there and that\u2019s not something a kid should be subjected to", "Not wanting to be responsible for other people's children is something I understand.\n\nFor all your preamble about his unreliability, you still trust your ex enough to take a child he doesn't even know camping.\n\nI feel like you should be smart enough to understand this.", "NTA for asking. But he is not unreasonable when he refuses.", "I know you want to paint your ex in the worst possible way and I'm sure plenty of people will paint you Not the AH for that, but what we're judging is what you did and yes, you're the AH here. The father is right that this is bonding time with his son. Time that, by your own admission, is rare and precious. Of course he doesn't want to share that with a third person.\n\nYTA", "ESH. Ex sucks because he\u2019s trying to pretend he\u2019s father of the year as long as it\u2019s on his terms. But I do think it\u2019s fair for him to say no, and the fact that you are forcing the issue makes you suck too", "Not he AH for asking, I don't think, but obviously your ex doesn't have the relationship your family has. He barely makes time for his son, so of course, he wouldn't want another child along. He kind of sucks. Leave it at that.", "YTA \n\nWhy in hell did you think that would be a good idea in the first place? Your ex and stepson are complete strangers. He gave your question a response and you chose to argue about it. Quite asinine, really.", "I don't understand everyone supporting this deadbeat dad. If the guy cared so much about bonding time, he'd make more effort, plain and simple. What everyone is missing about the stepson that \"isn't his kid so he doesn't have to bring him\", is that he's now his brother, not his stepbrother, his brother. The child wants his sibling along, and I reckon the mom has every right to call the dad on his bullshit. NTA", "Agreed. Also if it was my son (the stepson) I don't know if I would comfortable with my son going off camping with someone who otherwise seems to be ... unreliable at best?", "This is AI .... Right ...", "Exactly.\n\nNo one wants to be responsible for children they don't even know.", "I mean its relevant to establish that the desire for step son to go along was from her son loving his brother and not some move from her. Leave out that context and everyone is gonna he treating it like she tried to foist him off or pushed her son to want it.", "I agree with all of this. Mom should have told son to ask his father. Or just encouraged him to go without stepbrother because he has so little time with his father. Their father/son relationship is unlikely to improve if the stepbrother goes along. In this case, three really is a crowd. \n\nLet the boys camp out in the back yard or plan a family camping trip at another time. Or some other special activity.", "People are voting yta because she pushed the issue and tried guilt tripping him. If she accepted the no and told him to tell the son the votes would probably look different", "She chose to be the one to ask the Dad so she's the one who gets the answer. She should have had the son ask the Dad directly (it also would have had a higher chance of success to be honest - Dad probably likes his son more than he likes his ex/kids can be hard to say no to when they are excited.)  \n\n\nMom DECIDED to insert herself into this so she is now Involved. She didn't have to be. She made a CHOICE.", "No, that would\u2019ve been the case until you told him he\u2019s had plenty of time to bond with him as a comeback.\n\nThis is a thing that your son and ex enjoy. Let them have that. Tell your husband to take your stepson, then everyone gets the quality time needed. \n\nYou just wanted to shout at him and get your feeling out when he declined.\n\nIf you were just the messenger, you would\u2019ve been just that. And when he said no, said *\u2019ok, I just wanted to ask on sons behalf.\u2019* That\u2019s it. Then told your son he wanted to spend quality time with him.\n\nSorry to say, but you picked partner who turned out to be a crap dad. But he\u2019s still his dad. Your new life isn\u2019t his life.", "Based on your exes track record there probably won\u2019t be a camping trip anyway, so make tentative plans to do something else. Just don\u2019t let your ex know of these plans because he will actually show up, just to spite you.  Or, that\u2019s how it seems, based on your description. \n\nAlso, it might be time to inform his mother about how often her son actually spends time with his son.", ">\"..My son asked, I said I'd pass the question along. I'm done running interference for my ex ..\"\n\nyou're so full of sh%t, if you were really done you would have let your son ask his father himself. No, I see you now. Anything to get back at your ex eh? Just can't be a good coparent? Are you not over him, is that it? Still bitter? I admit, you had me at first but I see you know. Definitely an AH", "The Ex did not appear to talk to son.  The Ex complained to the mom and then to his MIL.\n\nThe way this conversation should go.\n\nMom - Son wants to bring step on the trip.  Ex - Ok I\u2019m not comfortable with that I will discuss it with him directly could you put him on the phone.  Thanks for letting me know.\n\nIf the Ex isn\u2019t an asshole that\u2019s how this situation ends.  Instead he argues back about it and given the father hasn\u2019t been interested in spending time with his son you can see where the reaction comes from.\n\nPeople keep judging the mom because they think it should be a father son trip.  That is probably true and I would agree with that.  But the mother is not involved it that decision.  The mother did not stop that conversation from happening with the son.  Instead she just gets yelled at for advocating for her sons wants which is what a good parent would do in this situation.  She communicated what their son asked so that the Ex could deal with it.  That the ex didn\u2019t is not her problem.", "I mean, the ex seems like a bad father because he only sees his kid 2-4 times a year\u2026. She asked and got a no, and should have accepted that.

They are very young in comparison to me. Every time we visit if we brought a better gift for her and something less for the cousin she didn't like it. It had to be equal. \n\nAnytime we wanted to take her somewhere, she wanted the cousin to come too. And if we said no it's about us there was a whole lot of crying and she did not look happy about it. \n\nAnyways, OP just told the ex the harsh truth. He has not shown up on multiple occasions and he should really be glad that the son still wants to spend time with him and doesn't resent him. Also, if he says no to this request that the kid made ( not OP ), the kid won't be happy. OP has seen the kids and understands that. His ex is just thinking from his ideal perspective and is not seeing that the kid wants something else from the trip. Separating kids like this who love each other so much does not work. They will dislike you for doing so. \n\nBut okay i guess.", "Then he should be the one to convey that. Not the mom. She just related the info.", "Because it was the sons request, not OP. If she just pushed this to be \u201cfair\u201d or something, I\u2019m with you.

That's such a small and sad way to see your world, that someone your own child loves and cares for deeply is meaningless to you because your jizz wasn't involved. You don't have to be related to a kid to understand they're important to your own damn child! It doesn't mean you gotta invite them on trips, but it does mean you can be shitty about it.", "That's the issue is that she let her anger get the best of her and vented. This is the part where Y T A comes in. He's probably a crappy dad but it's his trip and he gets to decide. Either way it's great your kids have a bond.", "\"Then told your son he wanted to spend quality time with him.\"\n\nYes telling him this with a neutral attitude would have been fine. or just staying out of it and letting the son call his dad and talk to him about it directly.\n\n\"This is a thing that your son and ex enjoy. Let them have that\"\n\nOP should be grateful for this. Very healing for her son.", "Ew", "So the little time he *does* volunteer to do his dad duties he should also be made to babysit a stranger?\n\nLook, i see what you mean, but bottom line is, son can ask, dad can say no. We don't even know how important this is to the kid. Only reason the dad's decision on this is being called into question is that he doesn't normally spend enough time with the kid. Taking this into account, I think it's ridiculous to create more difficulties in the situation.\n\nWe can debate how morally right the dad is, or face the fact of who he is, and it's highly unlikely the camping trips will continue if he's made to take the stepson. Any honest evaluation of the advantage to the kid would acknowledge that if we want him to have a relationship with the dad, dad needs to have agency in the trip. Fair or not, following every request of the kid or not. Dad being a half assed parent doesn't mean he must be forced to do every little thing his kid wants in the time they are together.\n\nAnd finally, frankly, I don't blame him in not wanting to take the stepson with. I wouldn't want to take a minor stranger into the woods.", "Um. Well this turned out weirdly confrontational. No, there's nothing fucked up about complex and varied family dynamics. That's life sometimes. Calm down.", "No disagreement that it should be on the ex to say no to his son. I think mom should have told the son to ask his father and stayed out of it. The kid is old enough to ask themselves and I think mom telling kid she'd ask is only getting the their hopes up for something she knows isn't going to happen in the first place"]}
