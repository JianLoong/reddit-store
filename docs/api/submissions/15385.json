{"id": 15385, "submission_id": "12utku5", "title": "AITA for asking my ex if our son (11) could bring his stepbrother (also 11) on their father son camping trip?", "selftext": "My ex and I got a divorce when our son was six. When he was eight I started dating my current husband. On the day my son met his stepbrother they stood in front of each other, sized each other up the way little boys do, and were silent for a moment. Then my son asked \"do you want to play Smash Bros?\" and his stepbrother said yes, and then ran upstairs. It was fraternal love at first sight. They've been attached at the hip ever since.\u00a0\n\nMy stepson's mother passed a few years ago, and my husband was actually reticent to introduce me and my son to his two kids, because he thought it was too soon. It turns out that where some kids get a pet after a parent dies, my stepson and stepdaughter got a brother. The first year we were all together my stepson asked if my son could come along when they visited their mother at the cemetery on her birthday, and he spent the whole car ride over telling my son all about her, and it seemed therapeutic for him. Later that night I checked in and saw that my son had climbed up to the top bunk and they had fallen asleep curled up together. Before she entered her current 7-going-on-17 phase my stepdaughter used to crawl into my son's lap as often as she did my stepson and ask them to read to her.\u00a0\n\nSince the divorce my ex husband has been unreliable at best. He cancels on my son regularly, making some excuse about work or what have you. The twice monthly weekend together have trailed off to the or four times a year. Every time I have to tell my son his father cancelled, my stepson goes to his father and asks if the three of them can do something together.\u00a0\n\nOne of the few things my ex husband likes enough to always follow through with is camping. He's planning on taking my son to the Poconos in a few weeks the weekend after Father's Day weekend. My son lives camping as well, and he's the one who convinced my stepson to join Boy Scouts next fall. The thing is, this year he wants to bring his stepbrother along.\u00a0\n\nI told my ex husband this and he got upset, saying that it's their time together and he doesn't want someone else's kid along with them. He says that it's supposed to be the two of them bonding. I told him he's had plenty of chances to bond that he blew off for one reason or another, and that he should consider himself lucky that he has such a compassionate and sensitive son and that our son still wants anything to do with him. He hung up on a huff. His mother called yesterday to complain that I was expecting my ex to just sit their while my son and stepson went off on their own and ignored my ex completely, and said that I need to look at it from his perspective since he only \"gets\" to see our son a few times a year. For obvious reasons this annoyed me to the point where I hung up. My husband says that he gets it and thinks I should let it just be the two of them.

Not for asking, but for pushing it.  Your ex CAN say no.", "ESH, sorry.\n\nI understand you, but you made a mistake. Your son is 11 years old. He's still a child, but he's old enough that he could've asked his father about inviting his stepbrother along himself. And that would've been the right thing to do. Regardless of whether his father's answer would've been the same or not, it should've been his son asking since he's the one who wanted to bring the other boy.\n\nYou inserted yourself in the situation and took the chance to throw jabs at your ex for his absent fatherhood. And your ex is right, though: the dynamic of the trip would significantly change if the stepbrother joined. No doubt they could have a great time, but it would no longer be a bonding, father and son trip. Furthermore, your ex isn't obligated to bring someone else's child anywhere. He was asked and he declined. You pushing and arguing was out of line.\n\nYour husband is able to see this, why don't you? He basically told you to butt out and let them have the trip the way it was planned, the way your ex decided it. This is pretty basic, but it's solid advice.\n\nP.S: The ESH is because your ex is an AH for dropping the ball with his own son. And because he should be focusing more on the fact his son has lost connection with him so much that he prefers to bring a friend rather than spending time alone with him, instead he's involved in a petty fight with you.", "NAH, you can ask but don't push it.

He shouldn\u2019t be blowing off your son, but you pushing it about the stepbrother going on this trip as well (and then trying to throw all this in Dad\u2019s face) was out of line. The flakiness of Dad is a separate issue from him not wanting to hang out with Stepbrother. \n\nESH because Dad\u2019s being a jerk to your son about not following through with consistent quality time, but he\u2019s NOT being a jerk about not wanting stepbrother present during the time he is participating in. Overall YTA.", "YTA - But I understand where you're coming from. Your son loves his Step-Brother and want to do these things with him. However ex only wants to spend time with your son though, because your Step-son is not his responsibility.\n\nYou have no right to push it, let your son make his own decisions. Considering how uncommitted your ex is, there is a good chance he'll stop going with your ex and instead try organizing trips with his Step-Brother instead in the future.", "NAH. It's great that the boys have bonded and you are being a good parent to both kids. But since the dad is unreliable, he needs to bond with his son as mentioned. And he has every right to say no.

You asked on behalf of your son when you knew your ex wanted one on one time with him. You damned well knew your ex was not going to take your new husband's child camping. The only purpose in asking was to show your son, once again, what a sad sack his father is. This may make you feel better but it is NOT helpful to your son.", "NAH. Your intentions for wanting to include your stepson are understandable, however, your ex-husband wants to have some one-on-one bonding time with his son, and that's also a valid desire. While it's true that your ex hasn't been as consistent as he should be, this camping trip could be an opportunity for them to connect. It might be best to let them have their father-son time on this trip, and then encourage your son and stepson to have their own adventure together on a separate occasion.", "I say NTA because your son actually wants his stepbrother to come along. I can see the different view points but I\u2019d consider the child\u2019s most of all.", "ESH sorry to say, you asked and he said no so that\u2019s that. He\u2019s an AH for not making time with his child, and he needs to be better. My advice don\u2019t push it, leave it alone. Maybe your husband, could take both of the kids out camping another time. Let this your son and his Dad.", "Not TA for asking, but YTA for going knives out trying to push it.\n\nNo one wants a surprise additional kid, and no father, regardless of how absentee they might be, deserves to have what precious little one on one time they have taken from them. That is what it is, and your ex is right about that. Bring along your stepson and it becomes a brother bonding trip not a father son bonding trip.\n\nTake a deep breath and recognize the wins you have already. Take your stepson and son camping sometime soon. As a family.", "NTA for asking since your son asked you to.", "NTA- you only asked this of your ex because your son wants his step bro to go. Your ex is insecure with his father-son relationship and it shows, but that's his own fault like you stated. The least he could do is make this trip the most enjoyable for his son. Exes feelings should be hurt by a kids leaving him out cuz wtf does he think his son feels everytime his father cancels.", "I don't think it was AH to ask. But I do think everything past his no was.", "NTA. But let this just be your son and your ex this time if thats what your son wants.\nIf your ex was involved in your life and spent time with your current partner and kids id say call him out for excluding your stepson. \nUnless your new partner is going to go along for the trip I think it could be a horrible experience for your stepson.if your ex doesn't want him there he may go out of his way to exclude him and be noticeable cold and dismissive of your stepson. Dont put a child into a possibly damaging situation.", "NTA\n\nYou are just reiterating something that your son wants. \nIf your ex was really concerned about spending time with him then he would be putting in more effort to do just that. I wonder if he would be as upset if it was just a friend from school as oppose to your step son?", "NTA, because it is what your son wants. All your ex is doing is pushing his son away from himself.", "The kid was asked if he wanted to go without his brother. Don't make him leave. Ex is a part time dad but brother is not.", "NTA ask the kid if he wants to go without his brother. Don\u2019t make him go. Ex is a part time dad but brother isn\u2019t.", "Sounds like your son would feel more comfortable with his brother along since his father is becoming a stranger to him. Time for kids is not like time for adults, a month is much more significant and your ex is failing him massively by not showing up.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the place to ask this question because you\u2019re going to get roasted. Being a parent is more complicated than that.\n\nNTA", "Nope. NTA. there is no such thing has half or step siblings and if the adults in their life don't get that, that adult is the AH. \n\nYou did good and those kids will always know it and appreciate. \n\nWe're family in this home.", "NTA. Yeah you have to let it go but I know how crappy it is when an ex doesn\u2019t care enough to spend much time with their own child. Your son sounds like a great kid as well as your step kids. It\u2019s normal for him to want to bring his brother but I wouldn\u2019t trust your ex with him. Camping with your husband and the two boys sounds like a much better alternative.", "NTA. This amid a discussion between the son and his father.  It\u2019s not for you to be the bad guy and say no here. \n\nIf the son wants to bring the step brother he should ask the father and the father should decide.  I don\u2019t see why you would be involved.  \n\nI think your role ends by telling your Ex that the son wants step bro to come.

But your original decision of sending your step kid along was completely unreasonable and unfair to all of the 3 involved.", "I've had to answer the question \"does Dad hate me?\" on a few occasions after he cancelled at the last minute. I don't need to *make* him look bad.", "I get that. Putting it lightly, ex doesn't exactly sound like the ideal co-parent. Which again, makes it seem like you even asking is preposterous and why I'm questioning the motive", "Is the ex really busy or he just doesn\u2019t want to see his son?", "You just learned that word right ?", "Why\u2019s it on the mom to say no to her son.  Why can\u2019t the ex explain he wants it to be just the two of them.  The mom just relayed the ask here and now she gets shit on", "It is absolutly irrelevant if he is busy or not. He is a father and he has an obligation to his son. If it happens once that he cancels short notice it can be overlooked. If it happens multiple times he is just an ass.", "Dude chill I was just wondering though I ain\u2019t making an argument\ud83d\ude2d."]}
