Its plain disgusting and gross to shit on the ground and leave it there.  The entitlement to shit on someone else's property and just leave it there is outrageous.  Not to mention how absolutely frustrated you must be to have dealt with this.  Other might say you are excessive for threatening them with police and that thery had to pick it up with bare hands but this doesnt sound like the first time you've had to clean up someone else's shit so I dont blame you one bit.  if they want to ride horses, they need to figure out a way to clean up after their animal, end of story.  NTA", "NTA. I dunno what it is about people who ride horses thinking that horse shit is any different than any other shit. You're right that it's rude and disgusting. They make bags to put on horses to collect the poo to be discarded later. I dunno why they put it in a backpack (??) But they should have been prepared.", "NTA. The horses pooped on your private property which you didn\u2019t give them permission to do. As it\u2019s their mess they need to clean it up", "The horse riders are poor problem solvers, not your problem. They should, however, be smart enough to recognize private property and have the sense to steer clear of it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. There is such a thing as a horse manure bag. And it may be challenging to dismount and remount a horse wearing an English saddle but it isn't impossible. Either way it doesn't excuse a horse rider/owner from not taking ownership of their horse's crap. Can you put up cameras to catch the offenders crossing through your private woods? A couple/few people getting reported for trespassing should cause the word to get out in the community to go around your property.", "As a major horse girl. NTA for being frustrated they are on your private property. I think it would be worthwhile to bring this up to your HOA or city council(idk if that would be appropriate just a thought). Not only is it annoying for you, horses through yards can be dangerous for home owners and the horses and riders if the horse is spooky sometimes. \n\nBut damn, could you imagine how big of a poop bag dispenser you\u2019d need for horses?? I can\u2019t stop laughing at the thought of it lol", "NTA, they are trespassing to begin with. And if we all expect dog owners to pick up after their dogs we should with horses too.", "Tell your gf next time you offer her backpack. NTA", "NTA. Surely there has to be a way to keep these people off your property?? That\u2019s so disgusting.", "NTA They need to get those bags that catch the poop as it comes out or deal with picking up the poop. And they need to stop trespassing on your property.", "NTA. Those riders had no right to bring their horses to your yard to poop. Your GF is starting to sound like your EX for not understanding that.", "NTA. They should pick up after their horses.", "NTA  \n\n\nthere is no way you are possibly the a hole for asking people to pickup after themselves and it is on them for not being prepared for their horse-riding", "Why not get some inexpensive plastic bags, such as the kind you might get to bag your groceries, stake them just inside your property line, with a small sign saying that they are free for animal cleanup. Who knows, there might actually be some conscientious people who will be willing to use them, either for their dogs or perhaps the horses. But another interesting fact is that horses are known to shy away from things that wave in the breeze and make noise, so the bags might discourage the presence of horses in your yard. They may get skittish, and their owners will decide to just move on. Also, you may not be allowed to have a fence, but what about some bushes, low hedgerows, etc.? Not all horses are trained to jump over obstacles, so that might deter them. But if not, it's hard to imagine a rider urging their horse to jump over something just so that they can get into your yard for the sole purpose of pooping.", "NTA, you talked to them several times, the fact they figured it's still okay to leave the poop everywhere means they need a reality check. You GF is just being pissy, ask her to clean after horses if she feels making their owners clean is not okay, lol", "Call the cops? Lol. From the US? That's my guess...people simply can't solve even simple issues without getting the cops involved there.", "NTA\n\nIf your animal leaves its crap on the floor its up to you to clean it up.  Horses have massive poops so its not as though you can just kick it into the undergrowth.  They know they shouldn't be in your yard so shouldn't be there anyway.\n\nI would put up some security cameras and pass the video on to the police for trespassing and not cleaning up after themselves.", "NTA\n\nTake the poop and use it as fertilizer. Grow tomatoes using this fertilizer. Throw the horse poop tomatoes at them next time they try this", "NTA\n\nAs someone who uses wooded areas shared with horse riders, it is annoying to have to slalom around piles of horse manure all the time, but that is just a fact of life in these areas. A rider on a horse has little control or knowledge about their horses bowel movements, and collecting it just isn't really a practical option like it is for a dog. It is also notable that unlike dog faeces which can be harmful and is generally much more unpleasant, a horses isn't harmful to humans and will fairly quickly degrade and wash away.\n\nThat is on trails where horses are allowed and accepted. The moment they started knowingly trespassing on private land they were not welcome on they lose any sympathy, and you expecting them to clean up after themselves seems reasonable - or more accurately, a fairly unreasonable request they won't be prepared to handle, but in my eyes suitable when they are leaving a mess on private property they don't belong on. People mistreating and damaging private property is exactly why we lose these sort of trails as they start getting fenced off because owners don't want to deal with the problem of leaving them available for people.\n\nAs an option, might I suggest a few trail cameras, getting in touch with the stables to start (who hopefully will want to cultivate a good relationship with their neighbours and will deal with the riders), and if needed, law enforcement.", "NTA. If someone refuses to pick up their animal\u2019s waste, id be petty enough to deliver karma myself by picking it up and dumping it in their yard. Show them how it feels .", "NTA - you can't stick up fences but why not a sign and a reminder of the probable littering/fouling laws in your country.", "NTA. Stand your shit-free ground.", "NTA.  I am pretty sure there are bags that the horses can wear to catch the poop. They should be wearing them especially if they are on public trails and the beaches. The horse owners and riders are TA for not being considerate enough to the public.", "NTA - Horse poop is big and can kill your grass if they're on that.  They're trespassing and you've talked to them about it before.", "NTA, but mannnn, embrace the poop!\n\nINFO: you have a garden and you're refusing free horse poop????", "NTA did they think they were leaving you free fertilizer? I don't know what the protocol is for horse riders outside of when I've gone riding in controller areas that are maintained by ranchers or staff but that seems quite rude to do. Yeah, horses just shit but is that not any different than letting your dog shit in someone's yard and not cleaning it up?", "I\u2019ve had horses almost my whole life. I\u2019m going ESH. And I mean literally everyone. The town for not allowing fencing of any kind. The horse people for trespassing. You for not at least giving them bag. I would absolutely put up multiple no trespassing signs around your boundary lines if you don\u2019t already have them. \n\nI personally find this whole thing so interesting because I\u2019ve done a lot of trail riding in many areas with a lot of different people and not once have any of us trespassed. We like being on the bridle trails and would prefer everyone else leaves those for the \u201chorse people\u201d so there are no surprises. If I had a dollar for every dog that\u2019s come after one of our horses\u2026 seriously though I find it so interesting that they\u2019re being so rude!", "YTA but justifiably so \ud83d\ude02 here\u2019s the thing, sure you could have been nice and gotten them a shovel and bag, but then they wouldn\u2019t have actually learned anything. They would continue as they had, maybe not on your land but on others, if they got caught they\u2019d ask the next person for a bag. I bet you anything this lesson will stick. One ruined backpack and I\u2019d make damn sure if I\u2019m riding a horse I\u2019ve got a poop bag.", "Hi, horse rider and owner here. \n\nI understand your point, but it unfortunately isn\u2019t as easy for horse people to pick up their horses poop as it is for dog owners. Carrying a shovel is not realistic, or safe, poop bags are an idea, but that also includes having to get off and back on the horse, and hold the horse while picking up the poop. \n\nHOWEVER, they should be in PUBLIC area. (Road, public trail, not someone\u2019s yard and property) they shouldn\u2019t be in your yard at all. Especially since there are no trespassing signs and you had already spoken to them. \n\nWe don\u2019t carry poop bags or pitchfork with us, so it was a little rude for you to tell them to pick it up, but not give them anything to help. \n\nI truly get your point, and they should respect your property.\n\n*** Editing as it seems my take isn\u2019t clear*** \nOP is not the AH. If they are riding in a public place, or someone\u2019s yard (which they shouldn\u2019t be to begin with) they should have something to get the poop. Especially since they seem to do it often. \n\nIn my experience, on the east coast of the US, the roads and public places where horses are allowed, are fair game for horses to poop on.  Only rules are to clean it up if it\u2019s in a walking path at some public places like the beach. Pooping on other peoples property, is not fair game. Most people here don\u2019t ride on the roads, they ride on trails in which horses are allowed. We typically have to trailer horses to these areas, and typically have a pitchfork in the trailer. \n\nThe riders should have been more prepared and OP had every right to tell them to pick it up.\n\nNTA", "If this was in your grassy lawn, I\u2019d say you were right, but it sounds like this was in the wooded area, which absolutely makes YTA.

But whether or not you do/can depends on where you live.", "so your argument is horses are too affraid of plastic bags so nothing should be done to clean up after them? that, is a horrible take", "I never experienced it on my private property but growing up I lived next to people who owned horses and my God was it disgusting trying to bike on the road as a kid only to ride straight into a random turd on the road. Though to be fair the dog owners were just as bad where I grew up. It was only through Futurama that I first learned it wasn't normal for dog owners to let them shit everywhere and leave it.\n\nPractical suggestions for your situation:\n1. Get a beware of dog sign. Even if your dogs wouldn't hurt a squirrel it may make people who would otherwise ignore private property signs think twice.\n2. The sound defense system someone else suggested. Tacky options include just grocery bags hung everywhere but you can get creative with it, many many options to choose from there. Windchimes and stuff like that, anything that makes unnatural noises will make the horses uncomfortable.\n3. As you yourself mentioned, letting your dogs establish a bigger presence in the area would do you good. Not sure how well trained your dogs are but if possible I would 100% look into training them to bark at horses. Not attack, just bark.\n\nNot bullet proof but neither is praying your hedges will grow faster than assholes can demonstrate their disregard for others.", "\"Bring me a shrubbery!\"", "\"Because you can't control a cat. They need to run free.\" Ok, if I trap your cat, animal control will return them with a $100 fine if they can find the owner.", "I thought cats bury their poo?", "\"Sounds\" being operative. In reality it seems like a shitty mess \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "If it's a guided ride, I would warn the owner that they can't go through there because he doesn't own the property and will not allow people on his land in case of accidents. I wouldnt want to be liable for trespassers.", "simmer down, i agree with you that if they were on private property they should clean it up. as an equestrian I am saying that riders carrying plastic bags miles into the middle of the woods will never happen. didn't know that horse poop in the middle of the woods was such an issue with ppl lol", "Yeah, its no longer fun to cycle or hike here due to the sheer amount of horse manure coating the cycling lanes and walking trails.\n\n1: I have that and my dogs will most certainly tear someone apart, I am surprised it hasn't happened yet if I am honest.\n\n2: Are horses scared of bags? Cause if so the wooded part of my yard is about to be bag central.\n\n3: My dogs are a Mali and a GSD they are extremely well trained, but obviously I sometimes let them out to do their business in the morning and I myself am hardly awake, like I said bound to go wrong someday and it'll go wrong bad.\n\nAnd yeah the hedges solution means I have to buy fully grown hedges because these morons will let their horsed trample them otherwise", "Only sometimes. I saw one of my neighbor's cat dig in another's veggie garden poop and covered it. Two weeks later I saw the same cat taking a dump near the woods without buring it.", "If they've eaten anything that's had aminopyralid sprayed on it it'll kill pretty much everything in your garden, forever. Very very evil stuff.\nSpeaking from experience.", "Bright yellow nylon rope about 4' off of the ground, tied at regular intervals with bright, flappy, flags and \"Private Property\"/\"No Trespassing\"/\"No Hunting, Fishing, Hiking, Horseback Riding, or unauthorized entry of any kind\" signs. \n\nWildlife can jump it, duck under it, etc. Horses will immediately nope the fuck out because of the flappy monsters and the riders will learn a valuable lesson.", "alternatively you could take a weekend and spray them with your hose when they pass by, check the legality of it but in the US if they\u2019re trespassing you should be fine\n\nalso NTA and please update us if you follow any advice from this thread", "miles into the woods?  \n\n\nwhat topic are you reading ?\n\nthis is an something that happened in some ones yard that IS private property", "That really surprises me people would ignore beware of dog signs. Maybe they think they don't have anything to worry about because of the horses?\n\n100% rustling bags would spook a horse. Basically any noise they aren't used to will trip them up, they are prey animals and any unidentified noise = predator. That's why I suggested the barking thing too, these aren't warhorses prodding around they definitely don't have the training to follow orders while being barked at by 2 dogs that happen to be the perfect breeds for the job.", "Excellent idea! \n\nI was thinking of posts pounded into the ground at regular intervals... Too narrow for a horse & rider, but wide enough for a deer, for ex. But I like your idea better - much more simple!", "That or completely ignoring the signs, I think they just dgaf and hope it is the exit to the beach.\n\nI'll let the dogs out next time to see if it works,maybe I'll just start chaining them up in the back of the yard when the weather is nice for a while.", "I don't know your dogs so I will only say only do this if you're confident in their temperaments and training. If you think they would ever approach a horse don't do this, a spooked horses hindleg kick is nothing to fuck around with. \n\nAs my last word, I like my dark humor so I was reminded of an old strategy used to defend against calvary in a fixed position. Very simply you just dig hoove sized holes in the ground everywhere. Only a matter of time before one of em snaps a leg. Obviously I'm not actually suggesting this but the thought of a man and his 2 dogs defending his home against the onslaught of the horse-tourist horde was funny to me."]}
