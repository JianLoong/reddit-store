Its plain disgusting and gross to shit on the ground and leave it there.  The entitlement to shit on someone else's property and just leave it there is outrageous.  Not to mention how absolutely frustrated you must be to have dealt with this.  Other might say you are excessive for threatening them with police and that thery had to pick it up with bare hands but this doesnt sound like the first time you've had to clean up someone else's shit so I dont blame you one bit.  if they want to ride horses, they need to figure out a way to clean up after their animal, end of story.  NTA", "NTA. I dunno what it is about people who ride horses thinking that horse shit is any different than any other shit. You're right that it's rude and disgusting. They make bags to put on horses to collect the poo to be discarded later. I dunno why they put it in a backpack (??) But they should have been prepared.", "NTA. The horses pooped on your private property which you didn\u2019t give them permission to do. As it\u2019s their mess they need to clean it up", "The horse riders are poor problem solvers, not your problem. They should, however, be smart enough to recognize private property and have the sense to steer clear of it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. There is such a thing as a horse manure bag. And it may be challenging to dismount and remount a horse wearing an English saddle but it isn't impossible. Either way it doesn't excuse a horse rider/owner from not taking ownership of their horse's crap. Can you put up cameras to catch the offenders crossing through your private woods? A couple/few people getting reported for trespassing should cause the word to get out in the community to go around your property.", "As a major horse girl. NTA for being frustrated they are on your private property. I think it would be worthwhile to bring this up to your HOA or city council(idk if that would be appropriate just a thought). Not only is it annoying for you, horses through yards can be dangerous for home owners and the horses and riders if the horse is spooky sometimes. \n\nBut damn, could you imagine how big of a poop bag dispenser you\u2019d need for horses?? I can\u2019t stop laughing at the thought of it lol", "NTA, they are trespassing to begin with. And if we all expect dog owners to pick up after their dogs we should with horses too.", "Tell your gf next time you offer her backpack. NTA", "NTA. Surely there has to be a way to keep these people off your property?? That\u2019s so disgusting.", "NTA They need to get those bags that catch the poop as it comes out or deal with picking up the poop. And they need to stop trespassing on your property.", "NTA. Those riders had no right to bring their horses to your yard to poop. Your GF is starting to sound like your EX for not understanding that.", "NTA. They should pick up after their horses.", "NTA  \n\n\nthere is no way you are possibly the a hole for asking people to pickup after themselves and it is on them for not being prepared for their horse-riding", "Why not get some inexpensive plastic bags, such as the kind you might get to bag your groceries, stake them just inside your property line, with a small sign saying that they are free for animal cleanup. Who knows, there might actually be some conscientious people who will be willing to use them, either for their dogs or perhaps the horses. But another interesting fact is that horses are known to shy away from things that wave in the breeze and make noise, so the bags might discourage the presence of horses in your yard. They may get skittish, and their owners will decide to just move on. Also, you may not be allowed to have a fence, but what about some bushes, low hedgerows, etc.? Not all horses are trained to jump over obstacles, so that might deter them. But if not, it's hard to imagine a rider urging their horse to jump over something just so that they can get into your yard for the sole purpose of pooping.", "NTA, you talked to them several times, the fact they figured it's still okay to leave the poop everywhere means they need a reality check. You GF is just being pissy, ask her to clean after horses if she feels making their owners clean is not okay, lol", "Call the cops? Lol. From the US? That's my guess...people simply can't solve even simple issues without getting the cops involved there.", "NTA\n\nIf your animal leaves its crap on the floor its up to you to clean it up.  Horses have massive poops so its not as though you can just kick it into the undergrowth.  They know they shouldn't be in your yard so shouldn't be there anyway.\n\nI would put up some security cameras and pass the video on to the police for trespassing and not cleaning up after themselves.", "NTA\n\nTake the poop and use it as fertilizer. Grow tomatoes using this fertilizer. Throw the horse poop tomatoes at them next time they try this", "NTA\n\nAs someone who uses wooded areas shared with horse riders, it is annoying to have to slalom around piles of horse manure all the time, but that is just a fact of life in these areas. A rider on a horse has little control or knowledge about their horses bowel movements, and collecting it just isn't really a practical option like it is for a dog. It is also notable that unlike dog faeces which can be harmful and is generally much more unpleasant, a horses isn't harmful to humans and will fairly quickly degrade and wash away.\n\nThat is on trails where horses are allowed and accepted. The moment they started knowingly trespassing on private land they were not welcome on they lose any sympathy, and you expecting them to clean up after themselves seems reasonable - or more accurately, a fairly unreasonable request they won't be prepared to handle, but in my eyes suitable when they are leaving a mess on private property they don't belong on. People mistreating and damaging private property is exactly why we lose these sort of trails as they start getting fenced off because owners don't want to deal with the problem of leaving them available for people.\n\nAs an option, might I suggest a few trail cameras, getting in touch with the stables to start (who hopefully will want to cultivate a good relationship with their neighbours and will deal with the riders), and if needed, law enforcement.", "NTA. If someone refuses to pick up their animal\u2019s waste, id be petty enough to deliver karma myself by picking it up and dumping it in their yard. Show them how it feels .", "NTA - you can't stick up fences but why not a sign and a reminder of the probable littering/fouling laws in your country.", "NTA. Stand your shit-free ground.", "NTA.  I am pretty sure there are bags that the horses can wear to catch the poop. They should be wearing them especially if they are on public trails and the beaches. The horse owners and riders are TA for not being considerate enough to the public.", "NTA - Horse poop is big and can kill your grass if they're on that.  They're trespassing and you've talked to them about it before.", "NTA, but mannnn, embrace the poop!\n\nINFO: you have a garden and you're refusing free horse poop????", "NTA did they think they were leaving you free fertilizer? I don't know what the protocol is for horse riders outside of when I've gone riding in controller areas that are maintained by ranchers or staff but that seems quite rude to do. Yeah, horses just shit but is that not any different than letting your dog shit in someone's yard and not cleaning it up?", "I\u2019ve had horses almost my whole life. I\u2019m going ESH. And I mean literally everyone. The town for not allowing fencing of any kind. The horse people for trespassing. You for not at least giving them bag. I would absolutely put up multiple no trespassing signs around your boundary lines if you don\u2019t already have them. \n\nI personally find this whole thing so interesting because I\u2019ve done a lot of trail riding in many areas with a lot of different people and not once have any of us trespassed. We like being on the bridle trails and would prefer everyone else leaves those for the \u201chorse people\u201d so there are no surprises. If I had a dollar for every dog that\u2019s come after one of our horses\u2026 seriously though I find it so interesting that they\u2019re being so rude!", "YTA but justifiably so \ud83d\ude02 here\u2019s the thing, sure you could have been nice and gotten them a shovel and bag, but then they wouldn\u2019t have actually learned anything. They would continue as they had, maybe not on your land but on others, if they got caught they\u2019d ask the next person for a bag. I bet you anything this lesson will stick. One ruined backpack and I\u2019d make damn sure if I\u2019m riding a horse I\u2019ve got a poop bag.", "Hi, horse rider and owner here. \n\nI understand your point, but it unfortunately isn\u2019t as easy for horse people to pick up their horses poop as it is for dog owners. Carrying a shovel is not realistic, or safe, poop bags are an idea, but that also includes having to get off and back on the horse, and hold the horse while picking up the poop. \n\nHOWEVER, they should be in PUBLIC area. (Road, public trail, not someone\u2019s yard and property) they shouldn\u2019t be in your yard at all. Especially since there are no trespassing signs and you had already spoken to them. \n\nWe don\u2019t carry poop bags or pitchfork with us, so it was a little rude for you to tell them to pick it up, but not give them anything to help. \n\nI truly get your point, and they should respect your property.\n\n*** Editing as it seems my take isn\u2019t clear*** \nOP is not the AH. If they are riding in a public place, or someone\u2019s yard (which they shouldn\u2019t be to begin with) they should have something to get the poop. Especially since they seem to do it often. \n\nIn my experience, on the east coast of the US, the roads and public places where horses are allowed, are fair game for horses to poop on.  Only rules are to clean it up if it\u2019s in a walking path at some public places like the beach. Pooping on other peoples property, is not fair game. Most people here don\u2019t ride on the roads, they ride on trails in which horses are allowed. We typically have to trailer horses to these areas, and typically have a pitchfork in the trailer. \n\nThe riders should have been more prepared and OP had every right to tell them to pick it up.\n\nNTA", "If this was in your grassy lawn, I\u2019d say you were right, but it sounds like this was in the wooded area, which absolutely makes YTA.

Sheesh.", "I get OP's frustration and anger, and i still think he's the asshole. I don't have a problem cleaning up after my horse. I've ridden my entire life -- mostly in an arena or other designated riding area in competitions or preparing for competition -- and most facilities with an arena, require you to pick up after your horse when you are finished because it preserves/extends the life of the footing (good footing costs a significant amount of money to install and still more to maintain). Cleaning up after your horse in common areas such as hallways, grooming areas, and trailer parking/loading/unloading areas, goes without saying. In either location, they almost always provide both the means of picking it up and a location for which to dispose of it.\n\nWhile I don't do a ton of trail riding or hacking, I have never, to my knowledge, trespassed on someone's private property, and nowhere I have ever gone had required you to pick up after your horse on the trails or anywhere else except the areas mentioned above, and if they don't provide tools for you to do this, you are almost always close to your trailer for both disposal and obtaining a tool.   Horse manure fertilizes the ground, is typically solid with little smell once it cools or dries out, and I have never heard of or known anyone being sick from contact with it (although it supposedly can) like I have with the feces of other species.   \n\nCleaning up in the manner he was suggesting after having traveled any distance your starting point brings many challenges that makes it both difficult and impractical to accomplish. If you can find an easy, and most especially, safe (i.e. won't cause injury or damage to the rider, the horse, their belongings/equipment, other riders, horses, equipment, or any other person, place, or object) way to carry a stall pick/apple picker/pitchfork/shovel/other tool that can be used to clean up manure; and something in which the manure can be used for disposal and transportation that is large enough for the task, affordable, easy to use, good for the environment and safe, there are still other factors to contend with.  \n\nYou have to dismount your horse, and because of the nature of the task: picking up a pile manure and placing it inside of a likely soft sided portable container of some sort, such as a bag that you'll have to hold open, you may be unable to hold onto him while doing so. So what do you do with him? If you don't have someone who can hold him for you, you could turn them loose in a safe, enclosed place, but what about your tack? A loose horse could step on its reins or catch them on something, possibly damaging the reins, maybe even the bridle, and could injure your horse. You could remove your bridle, typically a quick and simple task with most horses, but a fight with some, and regardless, it's still saddled. Saddling and unsaddling are considerably more time consuming, with a higher degree of difficulty and a greater liklihood of complications. Once all your gear is off, you have another problem: where do you put it to keep it both safe and clean, especially your saddle pad, which dirty, can have dire consequences at worst, or none at all, with a range of others in between?  \n\nIf there isn't someone who can hold him, or an area to contain him, you either need to tie him to something or hobble him. If you can locate something and somewhere safe to tie them, now you need something to tie them with. You can't tie them up using your reins due to the risk of injury to their poll, head, jaw, nasal bone/cavity, and/or mouth. You're going to need a halter and lead, or even just a long braided rope that won't cause rope burn or overtighten (and the knowledge of how to correctly use it) worn over or under the bridle, depending on bridle configuration/type and bit type,  or by itself. If you don't have the means or methods to tie your horse, you can hobble it.   \n\nHobbles are basically handcuffs for horses. Made from a variety of materials, with or without padding, and in both one and two piece configurations with various connection methods, they go on the front pasterns (the part of the leg between the hoof and the fetlock or ankle) to attach the legs together which typically restricts their movement and speed (often not particularly effective with mules and donkeys, and some horses find ways around them).  Not all horses are hobble broke, and most people aren't qualified to do so as catastrophic injuries can occur if done improperly. Hobbling doesn't prevent spooking, so even well trained horses can be injured or marked up should they be startled or react to something.  \n\nOnce you've picked up the manure and sealed it, you need to somehow attach it or place inside something and, assuming your horse is saddled and bridled, and then mount your horse again. Which means you may need a stool, hill, or something to assist you getting into the saddle and possible someone to hold your horse if he doesn't stand well. But back to transporting the manure: where do you put it, and how do you attach it? A backpack is not comfortable to ride with and, depending on weight, can impede your riding and the extra weight will affect the horse too. \n\nI've lost interest at this point, but have spent too much time to just scrap it, so moving ahead, yes, you can return at a later time to pick it up, but that could be hours from now and how do you get there? Walk back on foot or drive. If driving, how do you find the place? And also, what'sthe Costanzo needing to be traveled, especially by foot? Do you live in the area or did you drive there from somewhere else with your truck and trailer, and if so, can you get in and out of where you need to go to pick up the manure in it?  \n\nIt should be apparent to OP by now that picking up after your horse while out for a hack, isn't as simple as he thinks. He could have done so many things that would have achieved a better outcome for all parties, but he went into it on his own horse, High and Mighty, aka Itching For a Fight, and Right & Justifiably Pissed Off. Why not allow them the use of a shovel when they asked, followed by suggesting they dispose of it in the woods off of his property? Maybe put up more signs around his land or use upside down paint occasionally to clearly denote the start of his property? I think the biggest thing he could do, and it applies to life in general, is he could learn how to approach things with a lot more empathy, understanding, kindness, comraderie. \n\nThat being said, I do think horse people are some of the most inconsiderate people when it comes to other horses. Like when most non-horsemen pass out are being passed by someone on our with a horse, they slow down, or quiet down, or pause what they're doing. Most horse people don't. I've been at horse shows getting on my horse just outside my stall, at that point where you're not in the saddle enough to have its support or enough out of it to be able to bale, and had people come sliding past with their horse trailer with no more than two feet between us, like 30 seconds was too long to wait when they weren't even in the truck when I put my foot in the stirrup.", "> The entitlement to shit on someone else's property ~~and just leave it there~~ is outrageous.\n\nFTFY.\n\nPicking it up is a separate conversation entirely.
