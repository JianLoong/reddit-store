Craig has never been a genuinely involved parent. It was common for him to stay overtime at work or see friends instead of being with Daniel and Harry, even for big events and milestones, with the excuse that \u201cJenny\u2019s (the boys\u2019 mother) got it handled.\u201d After Craig and Jenny divorced, Craig essentially checked out of being a parent. He constantly made empty promises and wouldn\u2019t keep them. One of many examples was how for Daniel\u2019s 13th birthday, Craig promised to take the day off work for him. Craig not only didn\u2019t come, but he also didn\u2019t respond back to me, Jenny, or our parents for four days despite us all blowing up his phone. When he eventually called back, he didn\u2019t apologize to us or even Daniel and just made an excuse that \u201cWell, I have a lot going on right now\u201d and that we \u201cshould cut him some slack. \u201c\n\nDaniel and Harry are all grown up now. Craig is lonely, especially since Daniel and Harry are both adults and we don\u2019t need to invite Craig if we want them to come to an event or hang out. Daniel doesn\u2019t talk to Craig anymore but Harry still communicates with his father. Instead of just being grateful that Harry is willing to forgive his neglect and have a relationship with him, Craig chooses to be butthurt over the fact that Harry is different from him. Craig\u2019s upset that Harry doesn\u2019t have the same political views as him. He doesn\u2019t like that Harry\u2019s studying to be a teacher (my guess is because he doesn\u2019t think he can brag about it to people.) He doesn\u2019t like that Harry\u2019s gay and despises Harry\u2019s boyfriend, Brady. He constantly complains about Brady and it pisses me off because Brady\u2019s a nice kid who\u2019s good to Harry and has only been respectful to Craig.\n\nBefore Harry and Brady were dating, Craig already knew Brady\u2019s mother, Martha, because they both attend the same mass. Martha is a sweet lady and works hard for her kids. Craig was complaining to me about Martha working two jobs and called her irresponsible for not remarrying or finding a way to work from home. He was blatantly projecting onto Martha by calling her a deadbeat and saying she was supposed to stay home when Brady was a kid so that he would \u201chave values\u201d (similar political beliefs.)\n\nI was pissed and pointed out to Craig that by his logic, he\u2019s worlds more of a deadbeat than Martha. He has always prioritized work and friends over his sons. And still following his logic, Harry would be much more like him if he actually acted like a parent and bothered to raise him. Craig told our mom about what I said, and she and two others have told me I was in the wrong. Mom said that Craig still has issues because of our biological father. (Her current husband is the only father I have ever known, but Craig still remembers our biological one.) The two other people agreed that even if he\u2019s the cause, the result of Craig being unhappy and lonely is still the same, and I should have just walked away instead of rubbing salt in the wound.", "created_utc": 1679765905, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121t3l7/aita_for_throwing_my_brothers_logic_back_in_his/", "score": 673, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
