{"id": 22959, "submission_id": "157hfn6", "title": "AITA for \u201cstealing\u201d my cat back?", "selftext": "I\u2019m sorry if this is poorly written, my friend suggested I post on here, and I\u2019m on my phone. \n\nFor context: I (26F) adopted my cat Toby about 7 years ago, and I love him to pieces. I moved in with my sister (31F) and her family (BIL and daughter 6F) between finishing law school, taking the bar, and moving to another state for my job. I contributed to utilities, and groceries, cleaned up after myself (and for everyone one occasion), and took care for my cat. The plan was always to stay from May 20th to August 5th. It\u2019s been an overall great time, I spent a lot of time with my sister, BIL and little niece through the last 7 years as they live in the same city as my undergrad/law school. We get along great, and my niece is wonderful! She is my sister\u2019s rainbow baby, which has led her to be a little coddled through the years. \n\nThe issue: my niece has taken quite the liking to my cat. He\u2019s a very friendly cat, and loves pets/cuddles/etc. The other day, we were all eating dinner together, and my niece was talking about how much she loves Toby. I didn\u2019t think much of it so while helping my sister with dishes said \u201ccats are wonderful, maybe you should consider adopting one!\u201d She made a strange face and said \u201cwhat do you mean? we have Toby!\u201d I explained to her that I meant after I move out in the next two week. My niece came to the kitchen holding Toby during this conversation, and my sister said she loves him too much, \u201cyou\u2019re going take a child\u2019s cat?\u201d\n\nI was extremely upset by this conversation but kept cool and said \u201cwell Toby\u2019s my cat\u201d and I was never intending to leave him here. My niece instantly started sobbing calling me a \u201ccat robber\u201d and saying that no cat will be like Toby bc Toby is hers and he loves her. I kinda just grabbed Toby and went to my room.\n\nThis was a week ago, and I have received texts and calls from my sister, my mom, and BIL saying I\u2019m being childish towards a child. I suggested I go with them and adopt a cat, but my everyone insists on letting my niece keep Toby and telling ME to get a new cat. I\u2019ve put my foot down, and stated there\u2019s no world in which that happened - to which I\u2019m being called an AH.\n\nThis whole situation is driving me nuts. My friend group and boyfriend are on my side, but my best friend said she would just make peace so I don\u2019t lose my \u201cactual family for the cat\u201d.  But Toby IS my family.\n\nUPDATE: thank you all for your overwhelming support. I truly thought I was going crazy. I take the bar exam on Tuesday-Wednesday (luckily all this drama came pretty late in the game so it didn\u2019t interfere much). But this is unnecessary stress. \n\nI ended up finding a pet friendly hotel near my testing center and booking it. I also got a uhaul, and had friends come over put all my stuff in there. I had already packed most the stuff so it didn\u2019t take long. I\u2019m going to stay in the hotel and then head to my new apt on Thursday (I moved up my lease).\n\nLeaving was a shit show with my niece sobbing uncontrollably, and my sister saying something along the lines of me being unreasonable, and cruel. My niece tried to grab Toby\u2019s carrier out of my hands at one point to which my friend told her \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that if i were you\u201d and \u201cback the hell up\u201d I left.\n\nMy sister called me a bit ago, and I picked up (dumb move). \n\n- She first said our mom called her after hearing the situation forced me out of a house before my exam (mom had called me for an update, apologized profusely) and called me childish for \u201csnitching\u201d \n\n- she then said that she took her daughter to the animal shelter but \u201cnone of them were Toby\u201d but also mentioned she refused any cat that wasn\u2019t declawed. \n\n-She went on to say im lucky she doesn\u2019t charge my friend with assault (my friend did not touch her). I wished her luck with that. \n\n-She ended by calling me cruel and to expect a cleaning bill since she needs the house deep cleaned after an animal there.\n\n\nI told her to grow the hell up, and blocked her. Any further communication with her will be a post-bar problem. Toby and me are happily in our hotel with my piles of flashcards. Thanks again everyone\n\nETA: for the suggestions to get a cat for my niece - \n\n\u201cI have suggested to go look for cats with them. I just don\u2019t think they can even handle a cat without someone (me) doing all the \u201cunfun\u201d stuff like litter and feeding.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to subject another cat to an unsafe environment. We will see! But Toby and I are happily away now :)\u201d", "created_utc": 1690125445, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157hfn6/aita_for_stealing_my_cat_back/", "score": 830, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And what idiot is raising that little kid to think that wanting something is the same as getting something? \n\nThe sister and husband are unbelievable. Your niece is a brat.

In short, no matter how much trouble he's still causing over a year later (breed issues I didn't take into account) I'm not giving up the dog I adopted because he's family.
