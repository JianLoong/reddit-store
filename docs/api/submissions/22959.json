You have paid for food and toys, etc.  \n\nToby is your cat.\n\nThe child is 7.  By your description, she is coddled.  This may be the time she learns the word NO.\n\nI would consider moving out early or moving Toby out early.  My fear is that your sister will cat-nap him 24 hrs before you are supposed to leave.

If anyone tried to steal my cat, kid, family, or otherwise\u2014I\u2019d be rightfully pissed. This is insane!", "Dang, has your sister always been this entitled? Toby isn\u2019t a toy or a stuffed animal. He\u2019s your pet. You\u2019ve had him for seven years. He simply doesn\u2019t belong to your niece, regardless of how much she likes him, and your sister is out of her damn mind for thinking you should give up your cat instead of explaining to her kid that she can\u2019t just take whatever she wants.\n\nStay firm. Tell her she\u2019s welcome to play with Toby whenever she comes to visit but that Toby is yours. If you want to be extra nice, you can maybe offer to go to a shelter with her so that she can meet some other cats and adopt one of her own.

She should've explained better to her kid.", "Nta. Make sure that cat is micro-chipped.", "NTA\n\nThey are the cat robbers.", "NTA but I think you should get your cat out of there before you move.

Parents are setting the kid up for disappointment if the word no is not used.", "NTA Tobby is your baby. You do not let someone else take your family from you.

Take your cat and run.", "op=NTA\n\nI hope he's microchipped and in your name on vet info.(per comments-done)\n\nYou've literally had this cat longer than kid has been alive.\n\nSuggest that they give you your niece to keep since it's so important the two stay together.  I mean they can have another kid right?(yeah I know snarky-don't do it unless you want the backlash).\n\nIf you can, have a friend keep cat until you move out.\n\nOr you may come home to them claiming Toby got out and is lost(and miraculously found AFTER you leave--so they'll claim abandonment on your part).\n\nETA per comments, your sister's repeated manipulation of her child to get you to give her the cat is revolting and makes her a supreme AH.  I think after you move a bit of distance would be good.  At least until Toby's memory has faded from child's mind.  Because otherwise it's going to be constant guilt trips.  You don't need that.", "NTA and I am honestly not sure what is wrong with your family. She's not asking if she can keep one of your shirts you sometimes wear, she's asking (more demanding) to keep a breathing living thing you love and care for that you legally own and have invested time and energy into and consider family. To ask is okay, but to pitch a fit (not the niece to be clear as she's young and still learning, but the sister, and subsequently BIL and mom) after being told no for something like that reeks of childish entitlement. \n\nPersonally if I were you I'd tell any family member texting me about being childish that they need to take a good long look in the mirror if they think demanding someone hands over their beloved pet to someone else and subsequently harassing that person is okay to do. Never mind to do so to a family member. \n\nPlease don't ever use the word stealing with them, because in no way shape or form is that what you're doing. Even with air quotes, just don't give them even a slight bit of wiggle room on that front. Delusional people will take something small like that and run with it forever.", "NTA. I think you'd be fine with just Toby in your life - your family is incredibly entitled", "NTA, your sister is unhinged, and your friend obviously has no idea what it's like to have a pet.\n\nHere's a story for you: when I was a little girl around your niece's age, I wanted a cat. Badly. My parents weren't into the idea, but while attending a family friend's barbecue, he told me that I could have the adorable little calico I'd made friends with in his yard. Put on the spot, my parents said ok, and at the end of the night, we took her home. The next day, my parents found out that the cat did not belong to the family friend, but one of his neighbors. He was just an asshole and sick of it being in his yard. I was devastated, but obviously, we gave the cat back. I loved the cat for the 24hrs she was \"mine\", but guess what? Even as kid around 5/6, I understood that the cat belonged with her family. The next weekend, we drove a million miles around the state looking at free kittens until I finally found my girl Pepper. I had that cat for almost 20 years, she moved half way across the country and back with my family. You know what we didn't do? *Try to keep someone else's pet*.", "NTA. Toby is YOUR cat. Make sure he's micro chipped using your name (and update to new address asap) and see if you could take him to stay with your bf so your family Don't try and steal him from you. If he \"disappears\" immediately go to all of the socials for your local area with photos of you and him together from the last 7 years. Call every vet in the county to report him missing. \n\nPets are family, they are fur babies.", "NTA at all. I HATE when people treat animals like they\u2019re disposable- Toby is not a toy for your niece to play with. He\u2019s a living, breathing being that you alone have cared for for longer than your niece has been alive. Your sister and BIL are out of their minds if they think a two-month stay in their house grants them any sort of claim to your cat.", "NTA. Your sister is expecting a cat that has been trained and worked on without doing any of the work herself, that is a huge load of BS, the reason Toby is so loveable and affectionate is because you bonded with him and trained him to be like that, if you leave Toby the stability you give him will end and your sister will have to deal with a cat that\u2019s got behavioural problems because of abandonment. I\u2019m currently moving house but before I was able to get a place I was looking at homelessness with my two cats that I raised from 12 week old kittens that were my mother\u2019s who died in October last year and I was looking at rehoming them and a friend reminded me that because my cats have bonded with me so strongly rehoming them could mess them up and they could get behavioural issues due to abandonment. If someone wanted my cats just because their child liked them I would immediately shut that thought down and explain to them that they are my family. If niece really wants a cat, they should adopt a kitten and put in the hard work of training, playing with it but that\u2019s it they don\u2019t want to put in the hard work because they\u2019re lazy and can\u2019t be bothered that\u2019s why they\u2019re asking for OP\u2019s cat. OP don\u2019t give an inch to them and it would probably be better to house Toby somewhere different, your niece has to learn that she can\u2019t get everything she wants in life and your sister and bil can fuck right off enabling her entitled behaviour, I would tell the kid point blank that she\u2019s behaving like a spoiled brat which isn\u2019t a good thing. If they try to talk to you about Toby just walk away and ignore them, same if the niece approaches you about it, ignore and walk away.", "NTA!\nToby is YOUR CAT!\nI don't give a crap that your niece is a rainbow baby that doesn't entitle her to anything! \nShe's a spoiled brat that's gonna be ome a spoiled entitled useless brat as an adult.\nStay away or they are gonna demand you pay the little brats way in life.", "All of this. At this point I wouldn't trust them left alone with Toby at all. \n\nNTA OP. Get out and get Toby safe quick.\n\nIt's been a few weeks and niece is 6. She'll get over it easily enough.", "Yep, the real problem is that sister and BIL don't want to parent. They *could* be helping their daughter manage the feelings of loss about Toby, but would rather twist reality so they don't have to be parents.", "I temporarily moved back in with my parents with my dog, and my nephew was especially enamored with the pup (rightfully so, he is a good boy). He got a bit upset when I moved, but his dad sat him down and explained to him that the pup belonged to me, and we can't take a family member away just because we want it, and we'll come visit. \n\nIt's funny because he told the kid, hey, you get the fun parts of having a dog, you play with him and walk him, only have to pick up poop sometimes. Which is ironically how I feel about my nieces and nephews, I just get to borrow them, have fun, and send them back when the fun is over! It's completely possible to explain to a kid that it's not appropriate to take a living, breathing being from someone just because they've decided they want it.", "And the microchip is registered at one or more online databases, right?", "Make sure your sister or anyone who sides with her is not the back up contact on Toby\u2019s chip! Better safe than sorry. \n\nAnd FWIW, your sister is being stubborn and dramatic about a cat she\u2019s had in her home for 2 months. And being manipulative dragging your niece into it. \n\nNTA", "She should learn the lesson of taking no for an answer. If she doesn't she is devaluing the other person's opinion, which will deteriorate the relationship.\n\nIt's also a dangerous path to learn her to think that everyone should comply when asked nicely. She'll be receiving enough nice asks in her life. Her saying no should be respected too.", "It\u2019s important to actually explain these things and let kids understand yes and no and why as they grow. Imagine the entitled attitude they will develop if that is neglected. Telling your kids no is hard, but we have to do it out of love and understanding the consequences.", " >She said I\u2019d understand one day when I have kids of my own.\n\nNo. Not all parents try to protect their children from ever having negative emotions.", "They\u2019re freaking weird", "\"Then I'll just take niece because you didn't say I couldn't leave with her!\" What she is saying is idiocy.

She totally destroyed plenty of my things over the years, but I loved her more than anything and would trade every piece of furniture I own to get her back.", "Please do this and do it ASAP. Tell them nothing and have him take the cat when they\u2019re not around. They might try to hide him or cause your niece to throw a temper tantrum.", "I would strongly consider letting your boyfriend watch the cat now. If she\u2019s still not taking no for an answer I wouldn\u2019t trust her not to take/hide the cat from you.", "They can flip out all they want. You should rip the band aid now before it drags out too long. They're going to fight more if you're planning on having your cat there until the end.", "This.
