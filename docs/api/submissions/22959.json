I moved in with my sister (31F) and her family (BIL and daughter 6F) between finishing law school, taking the bar, and moving to another state for my job. I contributed to utilities, and groceries, cleaned up after myself (and for everyone one occasion), and took care for my cat. The plan was always to stay from May 20th to August 5th. It\u2019s been an overall great time, I spent a lot of time with my sister, BIL and little niece through the last 7 years as they live in the same city as my undergrad/law school. We get along great, and my niece is wonderful! She is my sister\u2019s rainbow baby, which has led her to be a little coddled through the years. \n\nThe issue: my niece has taken quite the liking to my cat. He\u2019s a very friendly cat, and loves pets/cuddles/etc. The other day, we were all eating dinner together, and my niece was talking about how much she loves Toby. I didn\u2019t think much of it so while helping my sister with dishes said \u201ccats are wonderful, maybe you should consider adopting one!\u201d She made a strange face and said \u201cwhat do you mean? we have Toby!\u201d I explained to her that I meant after I move out in the next two week. My niece came to the kitchen holding Toby during this conversation, and my sister said she loves him too much, \u201cyou\u2019re going take a child\u2019s cat?\u201d\n\nI was extremely upset by this conversation but kept cool and said \u201cwell Toby\u2019s my cat\u201d and I was never intending to leave him here. My niece instantly started sobbing calling me a \u201ccat robber\u201d and saying that no cat will be like Toby bc Toby is hers and he loves her. I kinda just grabbed Toby and went to my room.\n\nThis was a week ago, and I have received texts and calls from my sister, my mom, and BIL saying I\u2019m being childish towards a child. I suggested I go with them and adopt a cat, but my everyone insists on letting my niece keep Toby and telling ME to get a new cat. I\u2019ve put my foot down, and stated there\u2019s no world in which that happened - to which I\u2019m being called an AH.\n\nThis whole situation is driving me nuts. My friend group and boyfriend are on my side, but my best friend said she would just make peace so I don\u2019t lose my \u201cactual family for the cat\u201d.

Your sister is the childish and selfish one for acting like a brat and guilt tripping you by using her child", "NTA. The way i see this, you are not stealing your cat back, you are keeping your cat.\n\n You adopted  him so you have every right to take him with you when you move. Your sister and her family are being unreasonable and entitled.

Based on the behavior of your family of origin, Toby IS your family. And your best friend needs demoting to an acquaintance. I mean, if this is how your family treats you to force you to give up somebody you love so much, some distance from them will probably be a healthy thing for you. They don't even understand what it means to love a cat if they think it should be easy for you to just give in to your niece's whim. Good luck! Your niece will get over it as soon as she gets a new kitten.", "NTA its your cat Your sister sounds rather entitled to even consider this and if your niece stays this way she will have fun learning that in the real word not everything revolves around her. No matter what her mother made her think.\n\nAnd your mother and BIL sound very entitled as well expecting you to give a child your cat just because she likes the cat and she probably has never heard the word \"No\" like a normal not overly coddled kid", "NTA. More entitled families. I would be livid.\n\nI hope you don't mind me saying your best friend is not your friend. Your family is the kind you don't need.", "NTA. They need to have a talk with her about this. Yes she may be attached but that never made him hers", "Of course NTA.

One kitten that niece could name pick out etc. in the meantime keep Toby in your room and if it gets too intense go to a motel or take him to a friend or vet\u2019s too board.  As much as it upsets your niece she needs to understand this is your cat. You may have to go LC for some time until your family realizes this is your cat. A cat is not a toy or a shirt you give to someone, it is a living thing with attachments and it is attached to you.  Take your cat and leave. Also let us know you have your cat safe. NTA", "NTA. Your niece is 6, and 6 year-olds come up with some weird ideas. I have twin daughters, and they did the same sort of thing at that age, except they wanted a cow (we live in the city), not a cat. Your SIL's response should have been \"no, Toby is Auntie Cat Robber's pet,\" not \"hand the cat over, or I'll guilt you until you do and get the rest of the family involved.\" I'd honestly find a boarding facility for Toby for the next two weeks. These people are severely challenged around boundaries, so who knows what they'll do.", "Those people sound like psychos. Letting their kid steal your cat??? Tell them all to get fucked.\n\nNTA", "That's an awful mess! Your sister and her family aren't entitled to keep their temporary houseguest just because they became attached. Do you have a friend who can board Toby for the next few weeks? After this, I'd want to pay the friend and keep it transactional so there's a clear ownership trail.\n\nUp until the declarations that they were keeping Toby, I'd have invited sis and niece to come visit him and maybe cat sit when you travel. Now? Don't leave a forwarding address!\n\nNTA.", "The f*ck? They are TA for clearly just viewing a cat as a cat and for EVER assuming it would stay with them to appease their child!! \n\nNTA!", "A brilliant solution, unless sister says yes.", "Thank you for this!

Period. Your sister needs to grow up, and stop turning her daughter into an entitled brat. \n\nAlso, your best friend does not sound like a cat owner. You don\u2019t give away your best friend just to make peace. Your niece can learn a very valuable lesson about empathy and kindness. Toby isn\u2019t a \u201cthing\u201dto be given away.  Ask your sister if she would give her child away if someone \u201casked nicely.\u201d Because that\u2019s what she\u2019s asking you to do. \n\nFeel free to tell your what we say.", "your sister is a massive AH for not taking the opportunity to teach her daughter boundaries. \n\nmaybe suggest you take your niece with you when you move, since you also love her as much as she loves your cat. that should be fine right? nothing for your sister to be dramatic about, if you decide that your niece is yours now because you lived with her for a few weeks.", "Bring him to the vet to check that his chip is actually functioning.

Comes with the territory. Your sister is a huge AH.", "Have her clean the litter for 1 week. She may change her tune.", "Can you have a friend cat sit for you? Your sister's refusal to accept no for an answer makes me think she won't just let you walk out with your cat.", "Looks an awful lot like \"ask nicely\" is turning into 'guilt trip people into giving you things.' Absolutely do not reward that behaviour.", "So \"asking nicely\" makes her entitled to things? Your sister's parenting will land your niece into so much therapy but this isn't your issue. If there is someone who can take Toby until you move, I would suggest moving him there along with his vet records. Also, remind your sister he's chipped and registered.", "You\u2019d be right, she doesn\u2019t have a pet. My best friend and I usually always agree. We\u2019ve been friends since middle school, basically another sister. She originally agreed with me. Then changed her mind and said I should see someone about my \u201cunhealthy attachment\u201d", "This morning my niece came running to me and gave me a hug because she had a DREAM I said yes to her keeping Toby. I flat out said \u201cthat\u2019s all it was, a dream\u201d. My sister said I was being unreasonable and should consider at least leaving Toby until the school year starts (in sept). That\u2019s also not going to happen.", "Yeah I\u2019ve asked my apartment if I can move up my lease start date a little or maybe get a hotel.", "I\u2019m currently trying to figure out if someone can watch him. He hates moving around so I don\u2019t wan to have to move him so many times. My boyfriend (who is in the state im moving to) offered to just come get him now. This might be my best option but they\u2019re gonna flip out when the cats gone.", "Good for you on standing your ground. Toby is lucky to have a great cat mom like you.", "I wouldn't give any of your family your real move out date to prevent your cat from going \"missing\" just as your trying to move."]}
