It was horrible of them to abandon you like that.", "NTA - Reaching legal age might mean that parents can legally abandon you, it is not some magical age where you suddenly know everything you need to in order to support yourself and have the means to do so.\n\nEven then, most people in your country have access to their parents for support and guidance. If you had a bad living situation, most people your age have one family member who could take them in temporarily. If you needed a ride to an appointment, again you would have someone. Most Australian young adults have a support network. My guess is young Korean adults have access to that kind of support as well. \n\nYour parents know this. They abandoned you. They don't want to take responsibility for the fact they abandoned you. Your mental health was a sign they made a poor decision,  so they blamed you for it so they didn't have to feel bad. I am sorry you are going through this.", "NTA as a 43 yo Aussie who\u2019s Dad still offers me money and help even when I don\u2019t need it I don\u2019t know why they think you shouldn\u2019t be helped after the age of 18. Also if you are in Uni or other higher education most parents still financially support their children for that b", "Did they offer to bring you with them to Korea?", "NTA \n\nBut your parents sure are. That is cold, heartless and cruel of them to abandon you and with no means of support.  I hope you find a good support system in Australia and I would recommend going nc with your parents", "NTA. Both myself, siblings and parents are all born and raised in Australia. Bar one, we have all been supported by our parents much longer than 18 years of age. When I was 18, I didn't have an income, wasn't doing anything, and my parents still didn't kick me out and paid for my expenses. My sister has been in and out of abusive situations and they have supported her every time. My other sister recently gave birth to her 3rd and 4th children and my mum will be there for almost 2 months and I know she'll pay to take her 1st and 2nd kids out wherever they want. My brother cut everyone out of his life and she still paid his rent when he needed. This is pretty normal. If you can support people you care about, why wouldn't you? \n\nAnd don't feel bad about mental health issues, they are not your fault. Good parents wouldn't act like yours.", "NTA. Australian parent of adult kids and I certainly haven\u2019t left my kids to fend for themselves, and many other Aussie parents that I know haven\u2019t either. Take care of yourself and stop talking to your overseas parents and family, they don\u2019t deserve to know how you are doing.", "NTA. I mean they technically dont need to keep supporting you but \"banning \" you from going with them? Leaving you alone in a country with nobody to relied on any emergency? Parents of the year", "NTA.

I'm thinking something like compulsory military service in Korea. \n\nWere your parents always like this or was it a sudden change in their behaviour when you turned 18?\n\nAlso, not sure about Korea but mental health issues treatment is really not good in Japan.

I think they are thinking about his future prospects though I don't know how better Australia is in terms of life to Japan. \n\nI am African. My bff was American whose parents of our origin basically dumped her here all through secondary school cos they didn't want her to be 'corrupted' in America. She was here by herself for almost 6 years. Parents never came until she went back @18 to America. Happens a lot. \n\nI can't definitively say why Op's parents did that but, isn't odd to me. \n\nHope this helps.", "Just because it \"happens a lot\" doesn't mean it's not a completely bad/unethical thing. Since you're African, you probably understand that rape and child soldiers \"happen a lot\" across the continent. Should people who experience such things just get over it, and we should culturally normalize it?"]}
