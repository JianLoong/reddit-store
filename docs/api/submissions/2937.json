I love pears!  \nTo clarify: Our tree doesn't hang over the other property but since the neighbor's garden has a higher ground level than ours, it is very easy for them to reach over the wall and pick the fruits.  \n\n\nSo a few days after moving in I was in the garden and saw the neighbor lady picking our pears. She seemed a tiny bit embarrassed upon noticing me but when I came closer she said that the previous house owners didn't like pears and always allowed them to pick the fruit so they won't spoil.  \nFair enough, but I told her then that I happen to love pears and I'd like to keep our crop.  \n\n\nShe was visibly miffed when I told her that but she left the fruits she picked on top of the wall (....where I cannot reach them) and left.  \nI tried not to think much of it, but the next day I encountered her husband doing the same. Picking the fruit. I told him the same thing I told her already and he replied that it's only some pears and that the world would be such a bad place if everyone would make such a fuss about it like I do.\n\nI wasn't aware that I was making a fuss? I simply thought that if it's my property and my tree and if it doesn't hang over to their garden - can I not keep it? Why does he think he's entitled to our crop??\n\nI just left then because I was so mad and I didn't wanna risk saying anything mean, but I talked to my husband and he said that the neighbors are right and I shouldn't worry about it, afterall we can just buy pears in the supermarket and it's no big deal.  \nYeah sure, technically he's right, but I just can't get over the entitlement of these people! If they think they have the rights to things that aren't theirs, will it stop at just fruit trees? Or will they suddenly show up in my garden, playing ball and acting like they can do anything they want like in some creepy netflix series??\n\nI don't want some \"neighborhood war\" or whatever but I find their behavior preposterous. Am I really the ass here for telling them to keep their paws off my crop?  \n\n\n(PS: That was about a month ago and meanwhile all pears are gone, we haven't talked to the neighbors since, but today I remembered because the guy was giving me the stinkeye when I pulled into my driveway earlier...)", "created_utc": 1669073852, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1e44v/aita_for_not_sharing_our_fruits/", "score": 114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s probably neighborly to share some but it should be within the boundaries that you set, not the previous owner of the house.", "NTA.  I\u2019d be pissed, too!  We\u2019re planning to put in a fruit tree or two soon, and I\u2019d be so upset if someone helped themself without so much as a by-your-leave.  Before next season\u2019s fruit comes in, you might think about putting up some bird netting on poles between the wall and your tree, so they can\u2019t just reach in and grab your pears.  If it\u2019s so easy to go pick them up at the grocery store, let THEM go do that.  Everyone knows home grown is better, because you can let everything get good and ripe and not worry about transport bruising your fruits, especially with things like pears and plums that get soft and easily damaged when they\u2019re properly ripe.", "There\u2019s actually a word for this.

That's completely asinine and I can't see where your husband is coming from. I also don't think you should start a neighborhood War but good neighbors should be respectful of each other, and they are absolutely not respectful of you. \n\nI would tell them that you're willing to give them a dozen pears as an act of good will but anymore then that will be charged for. How stupid is your husband going to feel when he finds out that They are taking all of your pairs to the farmers market and selling them for a fair penny?", ">afterall we can just buy pears in the supermarket and it's no big deal.\n\nYour husband is TA and a pushover.  Why dont the neighbors buy their own damned pears from the supermarket and leave yours alone?  There is nothing like a fresh ripened pear from the tree.  Most of the time store bought pears cant even compete.\n\nI cant even imagine the scenario of a pear tree taking up space in my backyard, water and other resources from my pocket and Im the one who has to buy supermarket pears.  GTFO of here...\n\nYour neighbors are also entitled assholes who are blatantly and overtly stealing from you and the husband has the balls to tell you not to fuss.  You should prune your tree further away from your wall.  Maybe for xmas or a holiday, you gift them a pear sapling they can plant in their own yard as a not so subtle message.  NTA", "NTA\n\nIf they listen to you next crop, and keep the sticky fingers to themselves. take them a nice, small basket of pears as an olive branch.\n\nIf the sticky fingers continue nicking fruit, extend the wall height. The bird netting is a great idea.", "NTA. The **real** neighborly thing would have been for the *neighbors* to recognize that the arrangement with the prior owners no longer applied.\n\nAnd then to wait until they'd met you, gotten to know you and *politely* found out what *your* plan for the fruit of that tree was. And only then, asked if they could have some... maybe... if they could still do so politely.\n\nWhat they were doing and saying *was* entitlement, not being neighborly. Which is why you were \"making a fuss\".\n\nYour neighbor is right that the world would be a better place if people stopped making a fuss... for the people that are doing the things that others want to make a fuss about.\n\nThe real way for people to make the world a better place is to treat others with dignity and respect, including respect for their property.\n\nAs for your husband, sure you could just go buy pears at the store. But why should you have to? You have a nice pear tree right there.\n\nAnd, yes, you **might** not be able to use all of them. But, it should be up to you to decide what you're going to do with any excess that you might have. Not for your neighbors to just take them because thats what a previous owner let them do.", "NTA. The tree is on your property and doesn\u2019t even overhang theirs. You pay for the water to maintain the tree. It\u2019s your fruit. The entitlement is astounding and I would shut that sh*t down if they try it again.", "NTA\n\nIt's such a shame that people do this when the old neighbor let them do XYZ. The old neighbor did, new neighbor did not grant you that permission...it's up to each individual. It's not some weird free pass that never expires.", "YTA. You\u2019re not technically wrong in any way, you\u2019re just being an asshole about the situation.", "INFO a whole treeful of pears is an awful lot of pears. Did you have plans to can them or otherwise preserve the whole lot of them? While you\u2019re technically in the right, it does seem petty unless you truly were going to eat or preserve every last pear from the tree. I have a plum tree, and I eat, preserve, and give away bags and bags of fruit and loads still end up rotting on the ground. Maybe pear trees don\u2019t produce like that but I can\u2019t imagine I\u2019d ever notice if my neighbors took a few-there\u2019s far more than enough to go around.", "NTA and perhaps you should find something on their property to pick since they\u2019re feeling so neighborly", "You're NTA. If it's \"just some pears\" your entitled neighbors can drive to store and buy some, or offer you a trade if they grow anything. I have lemon trees that produce way more lemons than I need, my neighbor had more oranges than she needs... that's how it's supposed to work.", "NTA. But I would suggest taking them a few pears next season. I had this happen with my mango tree with older neighbors down the street last year. She would just take them and even tell another neighbor she had asked permission. Last owners were never here during mango season. This season, after I got my first few mangoes, I took her a bag of them. She later drove her granddaughter down a month later and asked for some. Build a bridge with your neighbors or you can live with a stink eye.", "NTA. The neighborly thing would be to offer a bag of pears but just coming and helping themselves is just rude. \n\nI used to be fine with my neighbors picking off of my cherry trees because obviously it was more than I could eat. Until new neighbors moved in and I found all three of my trees stripped and found out they were selling them at the farmers market.", "How big is this pear tree?\n\nI ask because I owned a busy riding school full of hungry teens, horses, families, and at night deer and raccoons. In front of the arena there were 2vsmall, unimpressive pear trees. But all of us together couldn't finish those pears.\n\nWe all ate pears, baked pears,  canned pears, froze pears and except for one bad year (we had tent moths) we never could clean up all those pears. There were always plenty of pears available to draw in the wasps, to ferment on the ground so the birds and foxes got drunk, and to be a mess after first frost, when the mushy pears would make raking difficult. \n\nYou may find that the previous owners were as wise as they were kind when they let the neighbors help harvest the pears.\n\nI think you have two choices here. You can continue to feel indignant and have uneasy relations with your neighbors -- and a possible plethora of pears in your future.\n\nOr you can find a pretty little basket, put five of your prettiest fruits in it, and make a gesture of peace.\n\nEither way, you are certainly legally within your rights. So I guess a tentative NTA?\n\nEdit to correct omission", "I was totally with you until:  \"If they think they have the rights to things that aren't theirs, will it stop at just fruit trees? Or will they suddenly show up in my garden, playing ball and acting like they can do anything they want like in some creepy netflix series??\"\n\nNope, that's a ridiculous overreaction on your part.\n\nAlso like... how many pears a day do you eat? Because our apple and pear trees ripen in huge quantities that we can't keep up with eating, I always end up bringing extras to work as we can't eat the whole crop!", "ESH - You're entitled to keep all your pears, and they were wrong to act like they did. It sucks not getting along with neighbors. You probably cant eat every single pear yourself. Why not take the high road and invite them to have a FEW, but also tell them your family loves the pears so you plan on eating most of them.
