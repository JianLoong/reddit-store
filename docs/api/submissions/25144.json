So, thank you to everyone who responded. I did read all of them. I thought I'd post this update to tell you guys what happened and explain a little bit of why I made the initial post. For those who were wondering about ages, I'm 21 and Jess is 25. My friends hover around my age and hers hover around her age. \n\nI wish I could come back and say that I had seen my own value and got myself out of the relationship, but the truth is that Jess broke up with me two days after the post. I was still thinking, and she asked to meet up to discuss things. I went in hoping for the best but was met by her telling me that it wasn't working, and she didn't see a future for us where we're both happy. That hurt a lot. \n\nI've spent the past few days sort of realising how stupid my original post here was, OF COURSE I'm not an asshole for not wanting to come into contact with something I'm allergic to. \n\nI think a lot of you probably wondered why I even had to ask. The truth is that I felt like I was going crazy. I genuinely liked and respected her friends, I thought they were really smart. So, to be told that this was the opinion of my girlfriend as well as theirs made me take it very seriously. When I went to my friends and received no support or validation, I started to convince myself that I was wrong. \n\nI also actually learned from the comments that continued exposure could worsen my reactions so that's handy to know now.", "created_utc": 1692586043, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wuzre/update_aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_use/", "score": 1234, "replies": ["You are honestly so much better off.

What you asked for was not unreasonable or controlling; it was a basic request for consideration and understanding about your health. The fact that her friends and even some of yours couldn't see that shows a level of ignorance and insensitivity that's truly concerning. But remember this, dude: you deserve better. You deserve someone who puts your well-being above a bottle of body wash and friends who back you up when you're in the right.

So we have separate bottles of body wash and separate loofahs. He recently approached me about wanting to move our scrunchies away from each other (they both hang on little wall hooks in the same corner, *juuust* close enough to maybe touch each other) and about fell over himself saying he didn't think mine was dirty and I reassured him that I completely get it, he doesn't want to risk my soap getting on his and causing a reaction.\n\nShit, when I started using it he told me it was his least favorite scent of that brand and when I offered to change it he said \"no it's okay, I'm fine, what matters is that you like it\" but A) I was never that attached to that scent anyways, and B) I don't want to make him smell something he's not fond of. Let alone touch him with it and give him hives. If we're in the shower together and I'm covered in my body wash, I make sure to try to avoid touching him, and if I do bump him mistakenly I tell him immediately so he can wash it off ASAP.
