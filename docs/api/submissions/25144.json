So, thank you to everyone who responded. I did read all of them. I thought I'd post this update to tell you guys what happened and explain a little bit of why I made the initial post. For those who were wondering about ages, I'm 21 and Jess is 25. My friends hover around my age and hers hover around her age. \n\nI wish I could come back and say that I had seen my own value and got myself out of the relationship, but the truth is that Jess broke up with me two days after the post. I was still thinking, and she asked to meet up to discuss things. I went in hoping for the best but was met by her telling me that it wasn't working, and she didn't see a future for us where we're both happy. That hurt a lot. \n\nI've spent the past few days sort of realising how stupid my original post here was, OF COURSE I'm not an asshole for not wanting to come into contact with something I'm allergic to. \n\nI think a lot of you probably wondered why I even had to ask. The truth is that I felt like I was going crazy. I genuinely liked and respected her friends, I thought they were really smart. So, to be told that this was the opinion of my girlfriend as well as theirs made me take it very seriously. When I went to my friends and received no support or validation, I started to convince myself that I was wrong. \n\nI also actually learned from the comments that continued exposure could worsen my reactions so that's handy to know now.", "created_utc": 1692586043, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wuzre/update_aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_use/", "score": 1159, "replies": ["You are honestly so much better off.

But here's the thing: toxic relationships have this sneaky way of making us doubt our own sanity. When you're constantly being told by someone you trust that you're the problem or you're overreacting, it's incredibly easy to start believing it, even when it's about something as clear-cut as your own health and safety. What you asked for was not unreasonable or controlling; it was a basic request for consideration and understanding about your health. The fact that her friends and even some of yours couldn't see that shows a level of ignorance and insensitivity that's truly concerning. But remember this, dude: you deserve better. You deserve someone who puts your well-being above a bottle of body wash and friends who back you up when you're in the right. Keep your chin up and surround yourself with supportive, understanding folks. And hey, at least now you know about the potential dangers of continued exposure. Silver linings, right? Stay strong, man", "Bullet dodged.", "OP you have a chance to find another GF one that's more considerate of your allergies.", "Trash took itself out.

My response was going to be break up with someone who doesn't recognize or respect you...part of that respect is to acknowledge that you have allergies and that it would be a simple thing to change soaps to one that doesn't cause you distress.

Depending on where you live, someone who lives with you that uses something that you're allergic to despite being asked not to because of allergies could be facing serious legal consequences for that.

Most experiences toughen the body up so it is better at dealing with it the next time... but not allergies.", "Agreed with both you and the original commenter, I cannot fathom how this is even an issue. I mean, for fuck's sake, I've had to do something similar with my own boyfriend and didn't even think twice about it.\n\nHe has very sensitive skin. Like, he has to use unscented deodorant, unscented laundry detergent, unscented dryer sheets, and the gentlest body wash he can find because a lot of scented products make him break out in hives all over his body.\n\nHe has no problem with me buying and using a different body wash for myself, as we both agree that as nice as his smells, it's not always enough to really get the sweat and/or stank off us sometimes. So we have separate bottles of body wash and separate loofahs. He recently approached me about wanting to move our scrunchies away from each other (they both hang on little wall hooks in the same corner, *juuust* close enough to maybe touch each other) and about fell over himself saying he didn't think mine was dirty and I reassured him that I completely get it, he doesn't want to risk my soap getting on his and causing a reaction.\n\nShit, when I started using it he told me it was his least favorite scent of that brand and when I offered to change it he said \"no it's okay, I'm fine, what matters is that you like it\" but A) I was never that attached to that scent anyways, and B) I don't want to make him smell something he's not fond of. Let alone touch him with it and give him hives. If we're in the shower together and I'm covered in my body wash, I make sure to try to avoid touching him, and if I do bump him mistakenly I tell him immediately so he can wash it off ASAP. Because, you know, I actually *like* my romantic partner and don't want him to be in pain or discomfort because of something I did/use.\n\nThis is the dumbest thing for me to write such an essay about but all that is to say that I can't believe this girl wouldn't make the slightest effort for OP.

We don't have it in the house. My partner will eat it sometimes if we are out but he uses mouthwash and everything before we kiss.

But I never had to ask.", "Exactly. I wouldn't call it predatory by any means, but I was in such different places in terms of life and just knowing myself at those ages, and I know I put up with a LOT of stuff ar 21 that I wouldn't have ever tolerated at 25. A part of that definitely included having friends like OP's. Hopefully this was a learning situation for him and his next relationship is MUCH healthier.", "Of course. The statement was more joke than prophecy. It sounded like they'd been talking about moving in together, so at some point she seemed pretty invested. It's certainly something that not wanting to change her body wash for a totally legitimate reason was *the* thing that made her say \"I don't want to do this\", then it is what it is. And indeed, I'm sure the allergy part will be left out in future tellings. But sheesh if the body wash was the *one* thing he'd ask her to change for him, then it's still a leap (in my book) to call it \"controlling\". By bf and I both wound up switching deodorants when we realized the other wasn't a fan. Because neither of us want to smell bad to the other."]}
