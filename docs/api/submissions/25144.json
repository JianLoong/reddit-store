So, thank you to everyone who responded. I did read all of them. I thought I'd post this update to tell you guys what happened and explain a little bit of why I made the initial post. For those who were wondering about ages, I'm 21 and Jess is 25. My friends hover around my age and hers hover around her age. \n\nI wish I could come back and say that I had seen my own value and got myself out of the relationship, but the truth is that Jess broke up with me two days after the post. I was still thinking, and she asked to meet up to discuss things. I went in hoping for the best but was met by her telling me that it wasn't working, and she didn't see a future for us where we're both happy. That hurt a lot. \n\nI've spent the past few days sort of realising how stupid my original post here was, OF COURSE I'm not an asshole for not wanting to come into contact with something I'm allergic to. \n\nI think a lot of you probably wondered why I even had to ask. The truth is that I felt like I was going crazy. I genuinely liked and respected her friends, I thought they were really smart. So, to be told that this was the opinion of my girlfriend as well as theirs made me take it very seriously. When I went to my friends and received no support or validation, I started to convince myself that I was wrong. \n\nI also actually learned from the comments that continued exposure could worsen my reactions so that's handy to know now.", "created_utc": 1692586043, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wuzre/update_aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_use/", "score": 75, "replies": ["You are honestly so much better off. Any person who cares about you would be horrified to trigger an allergic reaction accidentally, they would never intentionally do that, like wtf.", "I don't even know what to say. This is beyond stupid. \n\nThis is like the smallest gesture imaginable you would make for someone you had the slightest ounce of respect for.  I think it goes without saying that you are much better off. Don't even think twice about that one. \n\nAlso, it sucks to realize that all of your friends are dipshits. I came to the same realization right around your age.", "She\u2019s immature and inconsiderate. It\u2019s good that her true colors showed before you got any deeper.", "She did you dirty with that body wash.", "May she have a long and happy life with\u2026. her body wash.", "Still NTA.  She was so detached from reality that she thought that asking her to stop using something that was affecting your health was controlling and was so shallow that she broke up with you over body wash.  \n\nDude you didn't just dodge a bullet, you dodged a 2700lb 16in bullet fired from a battleship.", "Sounds like you're better off without her, and I hope you find a better group of friends who understand how allergic reactions work and what being controlling really is.", "I can't believe she called you controlling when you were allergic to her body wash.  It's great that you've broken up, it doesn't matter if she did or you did.  You may need some therapy to make you realize you deserve better.  Go find someone that cares!", "I think she did you a favor. You deserve someone that cares about your well-being.", "Thank you for your update. Love your honesty and the fact that - despite your reluctance - she helped you leave a relationship that was not good for you. Take time to let your feelings heel but know that you are already better off.", "Crazy how she and her friends called you \"controlling\" when she continues to put you ask risk lol. : \"can you please stop stabbing me, no I like my knife and it's not right for you to take away my knife\" lol she sounds like she uses feminism to customize when it suits her. She calls toxicity to every inconvenience. she's never gonna last in any relationship. Lol onto better.", "Nta"]}
