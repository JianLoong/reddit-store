So, thank you to everyone who responded. I did read all of them. I thought I'd post this update to tell you guys what happened and explain a little bit of why I made the initial post. For those who were wondering about ages, I'm 21 and Jess is 25. My friends hover around my age and hers hover around her age. \n\nI wish I could come back and say that I had seen my own value and got myself out of the relationship, but the truth is that Jess broke up with me two days after the post. I was still thinking, and she asked to meet up to discuss things. I went in hoping for the best but was met by her telling me that it wasn't working, and she didn't see a future for us where we're both happy. That hurt a lot. \n\nI've spent the past few days sort of realising how stupid my original post here was, OF COURSE I'm not an asshole for not wanting to come into contact with something I'm allergic to. \n\nI think a lot of you probably wondered why I even had to ask. The truth is that I felt like I was going crazy. I genuinely liked and respected her friends, I thought they were really smart. So, to be told that this was the opinion of my girlfriend as well as theirs made me take it very seriously. When I went to my friends and received no support or validation, I started to convince myself that I was wrong. \n\nI also actually learned from the comments that continued exposure could worsen my reactions so that's handy to know now.", "created_utc": 1692586043, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wuzre/update_aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_use/", "score": 444, "replies": ["You are honestly so much better off. Any person who cares about you would be horrified to trigger an allergic reaction accidentally, they would never intentionally do that, like wtf.", "I don't even know what to say. This is beyond stupid. \n\nThis is like the smallest gesture imaginable you would make for someone you had the slightest ounce of respect for.  I think it goes without saying that you are much better off. Don't even think twice about that one. \n\nAlso, it sucks to realize that all of your friends are dipshits. I came to the same realization right around your age.", "She\u2019s immature and inconsiderate. It\u2019s good that her true colors showed before you got any deeper.", "She did you dirty with that body wash.", "May she have a long and happy life with\u2026. her body wash.", "Still NTA.  She was so detached from reality that she thought that asking her to stop using something that was affecting your health was controlling and was so shallow that she broke up with you over body wash.  \n\nDude you didn't just dodge a bullet, you dodged a 2700lb 16in bullet fired from a battleship.", "Sounds like you're better off without her, and I hope you find a better group of friends who understand how allergic reactions work and what being controlling really is.", "I can't believe she called you controlling when you were allergic to her body wash.  It's great that you've broken up, it doesn't matter if she did or you did.  You may need some therapy to make you realize you deserve better.  Go find someone that cares!", "I think she did you a favor. You deserve someone that cares about your well-being.", "Thank you for your update. Love your honesty and the fact that - despite your reluctance - she helped you leave a relationship that was not good for you. Take time to let your feelings heel but know that you are already better off.", "Crazy how she and her friends called you \"controlling\" when she continues to put you ask risk lol. : \"can you please stop stabbing me, no I like my knife and it's not right for you to take away my knife\" lol she sounds like she uses feminism to customize when it suits her. She calls toxicity to every inconvenience. she's never gonna last in any relationship. Lol onto better.", "Nta", "Sorry my dude. I'm glad it happened before you moved in together. It's just so weird that someone would have an issue swapping out ANYTHING their partner was allergic to. People are so weird. Her behaviour definitely isn't normal or something you should expect going into a rship.", "[removed]", "You dodged a mortar round here. If she was willing to try and gaslight you over this imagine what else she would have tried to pull in the future. You are so much better off without a manipulative that has no regard for your comfort or safety.", "It might not immediately feel like it, cause it makes sense to be hurt, but you absolutely dodged a bullet there. She ranked your health lower in importance than her body wash...geez.", ">  I genuinely liked and respected her friends, I thought they were really smart\n\nSpeaking from the perspective of someone twice their age who remembers much too well being 25: They were really not.", "Mate, I am so glad you've gotten away from her.

Your request was valid and not even asking for a lot.", "It ultimately came down to her body wash being more important to her than your well-being... You dodged a bullet.", "You\u2019re so much better off without her.", "Dodged an almond, I'd say.", "I'm afraid this is the narcissistic world we live in, which has got a hundred times worse since it smashed head on into the world of therapy-speak.\n\nPeople use half understood concepts like 'boundaries', 'triggers', 'gaslighting' and 'controlling behaviour' without any thought.\n\nAsking for something isn't controlling. Making changes for someone you love isn't violating a boundary.\n\nGo find a nicer girl who is willing and mature enough to understand that when two people come together, both are changed.", "You're better off without her. I know it hurts right now but in time you'll see that she was bad news.", "If I found out my boyfriend was allergic to almonds, I would change anything and everything in my life to make sure he\u2019s safe.\n\nYour ex was the controlling one, you\u2019re absolutely better off without her.", "Still not TAH.  She is a selfish inconsiderate jerk.  You dodged a bullet there.", "Even if you weren't in a relationship, she shouldn't be bringing that body wash in the house anymore.

My favourite is, that's so narcissistic.\n\nControlling not to use body wash that has oil that triggers an allergic reaction in the OP? What did I read?\n\nOP - you're not and never were TA. Your ex is now your ex for a reason. Go forth and prosper!\n\nEdited to fix a typo (story of my life)", "Exactly. If she couldn\u2019t even bother to change her body wash so that her partner would\u2019ve have an allergic reaction\u2026.", "I remember the post -- likely she broke up with you before you had a chance to do it -- it feeds into the ego of selfish immature people to do that, but really it's a case of the AH leaving the premises -- she wasn't putting in any effort for a relationship where you'd both be happy. She was, however, hard at work trying to put you in the hospital over body wash.\n\nIf a bunch of internet strangers telling you NTA brings any closure, here it is: NTA.", "So hard to know what to say, I really feel for you.\n\nAnd you\u2019re totally right about frosted exposure making allergies worse.

It\u2019s ridiculous she & her friends called you controlling & Im sick of people (especially that generation) weaponise relationship & mental health talk (when it even doesn\u2019t make sense half the time!) to get out of being decent human beings.", "She (and her friends) are older????!! 25?! Oh boi, they are an immature bunch for sure. And that \"hive mind\" way of navigating their lives... Weird. You are better off without her, the body wash fiasco hinted at worse things down the line.", "No, you can do that. I would expect my wife to complain if I used a dud soap. She is entitled to say something.", "The first instance of weaponized therapy speak should be enough to reconsider being in a relationship.\n\nCongrats on your for being free, regardless of how it happened.", "You may not think so now but in a few years you'll look back and be grateful she broke up with you. She isn't a nice person, a nice person would never put your health at risk over a brand of shower gel", "The age difference - and that value you placed on her, and her friends opinion above your own - is a lesson in relationships with an unequal power balance. Im glad you're out OP", "Indeed, the \"friends\" should be next on the chopping block."]}
