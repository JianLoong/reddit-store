I told them he\u2019s wearing something other than what they got because 4T is not his size right now & that my son wears 9-12M clothes. I thought my response was okay until my Father in Law yelled through the phone and said \u201cTake that cheap ass material off my grandson!\u201d I paused to process wtf just happened & I then explained that my son cant fit a 4T, he still argued with me calling me broke for having my son wear the outfit I got him from Target. My father in law kept saying that he spent $80/shirt so that my son can wear it to church. Even after how many times I explained I told my husband to tell his Dad to calm tf down and not overreact over something so small. My husband was upset at both me and his father for arguing over such small thing but mainly he was pissed at his Dad for calling us broke. Which resulted in Mother in Law taking the phone and escalating the situation. She told my husband over the phone that I was a broke bitch and that I couldnt buy proper clothes for my son that they had to \u201cwaste\u201d their money. I told them i didnt ask them to buy expensive clothes for my son.  Even after explaining over and over, they were still mad. After that we just hung up and still decided to go to church.
