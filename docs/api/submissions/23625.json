The shirts on the other hand were Toddler size clothes. I had no problem, it seemed like good clothes my son could wear when he grows into them. We hung out , stayed for a while & they were telling me that when we they see us again, they expect him to wear the shirts they got for him. I laughed thinking they were joking because they knew it was kind of still too big for him. \n\nDays went by and we were getting ready for church one Sunday morning and my in laws called and asked which shirt will my son be wearing today and that they want to see. I told them he\u2019s wearing something other than what they got because 4T is not his size right now & that my son wears 9-12M clothes. I thought my response was okay until my Father in Law yelled through the phone and said \u201cTake that cheap ass material off my grandson!\u201d I paused to process wtf just happened & I then explained that my son cant fit a 4T, he still argued with me calling me broke for having my son wear the outfit I got him from Target. My father in law kept saying that he spent $80/shirt so that my son can wear it to church. Even after how many times I explained I told my husband to tell his Dad to calm tf down and not overreact over something so small. My husband was upset at both me and his father for arguing over such small thing but mainly he was pissed at his Dad for calling us broke. Which resulted in Mother in Law taking the phone and escalating the situation. She told my husband over the phone that I was a broke bitch and that I couldnt buy proper clothes for my son that they had to \u201cwaste\u201d their money. I told them i didnt ask them to buy expensive clothes for my son.  Even after explaining over and over, they were still mad. After that we just hung up and still decided to go to church. Only to be locked out and not allowed in due to being \u201cdisrespectful\u201d towards the \u201chigh honored Pastors\u201d in the church. My in laws apparently told everyone I was just using them for money and married their son & trapped him with a baby to try \u201cinherit\u201d something from them. Which is untrue.
