The people saying y t a because you have a poster up are crazy.  It is an exceedingly odd gift that I cannot imagine the vast majority of people would enjoy. Especially if you have never spoken about it.  Like you have to be pretty obsessed with a character to want a life sized cut out.  \n\nI guess he gets points for trying but... maybe make an amazon wish list or something for next time lmao", "NAH. A gift is not an obligation.  You are not required to like every gift you recieve. If you got something youre not excited about,  it's natural to feel disappointed. As long as you are polite,  you are not an asshole. Maybe wait until he's out of the room to text your friend next time. \n\nHe clearly tried. I can follow his thought process but man,  you don't give someone a life size cutout unless you are certain the recipient will love it. Think that was a clear misfire on his part. That being said,  it sucks knowing that someone didn't like the gift you gave them so his disappointment is understandable. \n\nMy first few gifts to my now wife were also hilariously bad.  It took time but i eventually learned what clues to look for and what was really meaningful to her.... and she learned how to drop better clues.

The cut out is based on you having a poster up, if you had taken that poster down or even explained to your bf that it was your ex's and not yours be wouldn't have gone out of his way to find a cut out of it for you. He paid attention to the shit you have and tried to get you a cut out of something he really thought you liked. \n\nAs for the make up pallette, it sounds like he tried to get you colours you didn't already own so you could have more variety. Why would you want repeats of colours you already have? It legit sounds like he tried and you could have thanked him and explained that the poster wasn't yours instead of messaging a friend to complain - a complaint your bf could see.", "ESH, probably. What did you get him for Christmas? Was he gracious in accepting them? After 3 months dating he should have known that poster wasn\u2019t yours (he should have known this because you should have told him). Makeup is also just a hard thing to buy for someone else, so I see what he was trying to do, and I understand it was a miss for you, but yeah\u2026 I dunno. I think you both should have had more conversations about Christmas to avoid hurt feelings. \n\nMy husband and I did our first Christmas together when we\u2019d been dating 4 months. We set a strict budget and expectations on the gifts being small.

You should be able to communicate when gifts miss the mark from someone you\u2019re supposed to be most comfortable with. If you can\u2019t do that, you\u2019re not with the correct person. Holding it in only builds resentment.

I don't care what she had hanging on her wall. this dude is capable of communicating and should have asked. op isn't an asshole just cause she never got around to taking the damn thing down. I'll say NAH cause his intentions were good, but you gotta have to a talk with him about communicating and not just making assumptions cause you ain't been together long enough for him to know you that well", "Yta the poster was never removed, he had every reason to think he was getting you something you\u2019d appreciate and would show that he is observing things he thinks you like. I get being disappointed but he did put thoughts in and it\u2019s sweet", "NTA, I\u2019m shocked at all the Y T As. Gifting is about the recipient, not the giver. My first Christmas with my SO, they did something similar and went over the top with a bunch of gifts that I had no use for (things like clothes, I\u2019m a very slim and petite person and none of the clothes fit me, they were all the smallest size so there was no exchanging for another size or anything). Another year they bought me a very expensive gift for a hobby that I used to have but haven\u2019t touched in years. They got upset when I asked to return them all, despite me making it clear that while I appreciated the thought, the items weren\u2019t things I had use for. Over time they came to understand and now they just ask me what I want and get that for me. \n\nI get being bummed if you get someone a gift you\u2019re excited for and they don\u2019t react the way you want, but the gift isn\u2019t for you, it\u2019s for them. If someone doesn\u2019t like their gift I\u2019m still happy to give them a gift receipt or return it and get something else that they like. It\u2019s possible to both be grateful and acknowledge that it\u2019s not something you have use for. In a relatively new relationship, I get why you didn\u2019t feel comfortable telling him you didn\u2019t like the makeup palette, especially after he got upset when you told him you didn\u2019t like the first gift. Like what\u2019s the alternative, you say thanks, don\u2019t set up the cut out or touch the makeup palette and lie when he asks where they are or if you\u2019ve used them? That\u2019s a lose-lose situation", "NTA. A lifesize cut out is a super weird gif, especially since you only had one poster about Miku, and never spoke about her. Would be more understandable if you had a shelf full of Miku stuff. He didn't even ask if you like her.

He obviously thought it was something that you had that you appreciated so he was trying to do a surprise and find something unique and interesting and different. And I totally agree with your boyfriend about talking to another friend about it or texting another friend about your disappointment. He should\u2019ve been nowhere around you, and it should not have been such a crushing ordeal for you to have to try to find someone to talk to about it, or to gripe about it immediately. You were absolutely ungrateful for the thought and effort that he put into it. Just because you don\u2019t like the character or don\u2019t like cut outs doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t do a lot of work and put a lot of effort into finding it or getting it. You are completely overlooking that part of things- he thought that this was something that you enjoyed. It is an unfortunate situation, but one could\u2019ve easily and gently spoke to him about and explained why you didn\u2019t care for it. Especially since your relationship is so new.  You being picky about the make up is just that. It almost seems petty that you\u2019re upset about the make up palette because you don\u2019t like all the colors in it but I understand where you\u2019re coming from. I think the disappointment from the first gift got your hopes up for the second gift and then you were disappointed again. I do understand that you gave him some hints about what you might like, but it sounds like he was trying to do something that would be a big surprise. So if he got you a bunch of things that you listed, it wouldn\u2019t seem special or seem like a surprise probably. I think you should just talk to him about why he got the things that he got. And I think you owe him a huge apology for basically going behind his back and griping about things that he made an effort to do for you. That wasn\u2019t very kind or loving.", "NAH. \n\nYou're both pretty young, and it can be challenging to really hone in on good gift giving, especially if it wasn't really a focus when growing up. So I don't think I would read into him not nailing the gifts this Christmas. The silent treatment seems like an overreaction to me though, but I think a conversation could clear things up between the two of you down the line. \n\nBut you're not wrong for disliking the gifts either. You can't help what you like/dislike. And while he found out that you disliked the gifts, you didn't act like that when you opened them and didn't intend for him to find out.", "Originally was ready to say N AH or even N T A but seeing that you\u2019ve only been together for three months, YTA. At that point you\u2019re still figuring out each others interests and the stakes or expectations shouldn\u2019t be high for gift giving. It sounds like he was going off of what little he had for your interests and wanted to surprise you by not asking clarifying questions on what you\u2019d have wanted, maybe esp because 3 months is definitely in that gray area window of gift giving in a relationship. You\u2019re expecting him to have been a total mindreader", "NTA and it\u2019s not your fault he\u2019s sulking. My husband has to take my daughter for purchasing for me. Cook his favourite meal and tell him how you feel about him then suggest that you each write lists and pick from them. You have to be specific though. \u201cSun glasses\u201d is useless. You have to give brand, model, colour etc", "NAH. I think other commenters have covered the Miku cut-out pretty thoroughly, so I'll address the makeup one. \n\nI get where you're coming from with the makeup gift because, as you've said, you don't even really wear makeup. That kind of makes the act of him giving you makeup read like generic \"girl gift.\" Like when dudes only ever gift their wives cooking and cleaning appliances year after year (I mean specifically when they have not ever communicated an interest in receiving such items). I do also understand where people are saying that you guys haven't been dating for very long, so without much to go on, he did try to find something he hoped you would like. \n\nThe makeup thing reminds me of a guy I dated a long time ago who would randomly show up at my job with gifts. Sounds super sweet, right? However, back then, I didn't like receiving gifts and told him as much, since receiving gifts used to make me uncomfortable (which I did explain to him.) We'd known each other for at least a year at this point and chatted a lot every single day (sometimes in person, sometimes via text), so we did know each other pretty well.\n\nIn addition to bringing me gifts when I said I didn't want any in the first place, the things he got me were all really random things that he thought a girl would like in general. He didn't bother to take time to think about what *I* would like. Because of this, he just so happened to get me things that I really hated and had explicitly expressed dislike of previously. It was hard to be grateful for these things, as they made me feel like he just didn't listen to me or pay attention to what I'd said. \n\nI don't think either of you are really assholes in this situation. I completely understand being utterly baffled and disappointed by these gifts as you have no interest in them, but I do think it was nice that he paid attention to notice your Miku poster and getting something Miku-related *was* actually a good idea on his part when he'd seen something of it hanging up in your home. He just missed the mark unintentionally. (Okay, gifting someone a cardboard cut-out of anything is a really odd choice tbh, but he did try to pick something that would have meaning to you.) You're not an asshole for venting to your friend about the situation, either. It's just an awkward situation all the way around, but I'm sure both of you will feel a bit better about it after re-discussing it in the near future, perhaps after the initial hurt feelings die down a bit.\n\n*Edit: a typo", "NAH\n\nYou were disappointed cause you didn't think his gifts were thoughtful about what you'd like. \n\nHe is upset cause his first gift to you was an attempt at doing that, even though it didn't work. \n\nJust give yourselves time to cool off, then talk about it calmly. It's early on in your relationship. You can work this out.", "ESH. Look, you had a poster and never mentioned anything about it. So I would also have assumed that you would like it if you don't remove it.\n\nThat said, a full-blown cutout? Not like a figurine or anything? That's just a bad idea. Who the fuck has room for that? I would not give that to someone based on the solitary poster. If you had a room full of her stuff? Yes. One poster? Get another poster, or a plushie or a figurine, or a funko pop. \n\nMakeup for someone who doesn't wear any is a bad idea. Never mind your colors because you may need neutrals at a formal event, but if you barely wear any, is like giving a guy a tie randomly. \n\nHe sucks at gift giving, you suck at communicating your wants and likes. And no, him eavesdropping and then complaining about you not liking his presents, making him upset is also not a thing.\n\nYou guys need to learn to communicate and grow in a relationship before trying to be seriously committed to someone.", "NTA those are very weird and unpractical gifts", "YTA.\n\nHave you ever heard of the saying, \"it's the thought that counts\"?\n\nThe fact that he assumed you liked the character is 100% your fault. \n\nBut the biggest reason you're the AH is actually the text. You want to talk to your friend about it, fine. But did you have to do it right then and there? It's not easy to \"notice\" what someone is typing on their phone unless you're literally right next to each other. You couldn't wait until you were 5 feet away from him before texting?\n\nI actually find it hard to believe it was an accident.", "In the future, make an Amazon wish list with the sizes, colors and whatever details of the things you DO want. Let him know about the list and choose to order from it. You will always get the things that YOU want.", "His choice of a cut-out was odd, but if he saw the poster and assumed it was yours (who wouldn't), then that was a real attempt to see the real you and get a gift you would appreciate. If you believe that it's the thought that counts, then his thoughts should count -- he wanted you to be happy and he went out of his way to find something he thought you liked, then got a present based on that information. Do you realize how rare that can be? I hope you don't have to find out. And his second present...it's daring to buy makeup for someone without foreknowledge, to be sure. But hardly thoughtless.\n\nHis choices were swings and misses, and that's at least partly on you where the strange background of the poster is concerned, as he didn't know any of that. But while he tried and didn't hit the mark, YTA here.", "INFO: How long have you been together? I think this comes down to whether he should've been able to know that you wouldn't be into thiese\n\nIf you've been together for awhile, he should be able to observe at least these two things\n\n1. You dont talk about that anime much, if ever (implies you arent into it)\n2.

I've been with my wife for 7 years, 3 married. Our first holiday season together, was not our finest, and I'd hazard a guess that most aren't for first time couples. You've been together only 3mo. That's barely enough time for him to truely get to know you and the types of things you *actually* like getting as gifts. And given how you reacted, if I was him, I wouldn't really be all that encouraged to try again, let alone let the relationship continue. If he gives your another chance, maybe instead if sh*ng all over the things he gives you, gently give constructive criticism and communicate the things you really want as gifts. For example, my wife and I have a sort of inside joke, that after I spent so much money on her engagement ring, she wouldn't be getting any more jewelry from me again because we couldn't afford it. Especially after this year with the birth of our first child. But, I've always known it wasn't really a joke and she really did want another piece of jewelry from me, didn't even have to be expensive. So this year, I hopped on Etsy and found a very affordable 14k white gold necklace with an elephant pendant (her favorite animal) and got it customized with her name in it. She adores it. Anyways. If you want this to last, give the poor guy a fighting chance next time and actually just tell him what you want.", "NTA youve been talking ab stuff you would like, he shouldve put more thought into your gifts", "NTA people are getting way to hung up on the fact you had a poster and ignore the fact that his gift was a life sized cutout. Even IF you had been a fan that is not the sort of thing you give someone unless you are 100% sure it's something they want. A normal gift would have been a mouse mat or another poster or a figurine or countless other options, not something that takes up a huge space in your home.", "NTA for any feelings you have.

Even to your friend, you could have expressed frustration, while still complimenting his effort.  Had you simply thanked him (emphasizing his effort), and kindly explained the history of the poster, it might have softened the blow.\n\nIt's also important that you've only been together for three months, so at this point you still have a lot to learn about each other.

It's not about me, it's about the person receiving the gifts and I know personally I want stuff I like not random guesses.\n\nYour boyfriend took a risk on something based on a poster, and if he'd got you a figurine or a mug that would have been understandable, something compact. But a life size cut out of a character you presumably haven't mentioned fondly in your time together is a bit strange. The make up pallet is a bit more forgivable, since it's just a generic gift for someone you haven't been seeing so long and know does occasionally wear make up, as occasional wearers tend to be less colourful, so that's a reasonable guess, although again, make up can be very personal so he should have found a way do a bit of research on you, not just relied on generics. None of this makes him an AH, just a bit clueless. He's not even an AH for being upset you didn't like the gifts, that's kind of a natural disappointment. Him getting sulky and silent treatmenting you though, after telling you to tell him if you disliked the gifts, that's the slightly AH behaviour.\n\nYou were gracious in receiving. You expressed a reasonable confusion and dislike of the first gift, and you kept the second to a solid \"Thank you\". He'd never have noticed you not using that pallet, but I assume he would notice you not prominently displaying a cut out, so that one yeah I agree you needed to tell him about not just suck it up.\n\nIf he can get off his high horse this isn't an insurmountable problem, it's just a good time to talk about expectations for future gifting. Maybe agree not to hint and to outright say \"This is what I want for my birthday/ Christmas\". Maybe agree that you'll both do wish lists from now on, and that one present should be from there even if a punt gets taken on a second one.

No way I would just keep, let alone display, a big thing like that in my apartment when I don't like it (and like OP, it would probably freak me out at night), so it would become very obvious very quickly that the gift was a miss.

It honestly doesn't matter that much in the end for this particular scenario. OP could have been a fan of the character and the gift could still be a miss for other reasons (like it being a giant cardboard you have to find space for and hopefully it doesn't look like it's haunting you at night). Again, people are not AH for not liking gifts. \n\nAnd she chose to not say anything to him about the second gift because she didn't want to hurt him.

For example, a coworker would tell me his favorite cake is oreo ice cream cake and he liked pokemon so I would get him stuff involving those two things, if I noticed another coworker looking at something they like I'd try to get them something similar. My point being, my ND ass really struggles at \"noticing the little things\" often but because I care I make an extra effort to remember things they mentioned. I think he really tried by remembering that poster, that's actually impressive he remembered something so small and shows he was trying to put in the effort.

And the same is *usually* true for platonic friendships as well. \n\nHonestly the fact that he's a guy in his early 20's, and has actually been observing you enough to even venture into more sentimental territory is already a plus. He will only get more observant from here on out.

As a lady I'd have realized that and said \"ya know, I'm not sure what she prefers, but it *is* winter, so darker hues are suitable for the time of year\", added to the fact that if you're not super sure the EXACT colors someone likes, it's a safer bet to avoid overly loud colors when gifting.

That is the level of \"attention\" this dude paid.", "How, exactly, did he give thought to the makeup? She says she rarely wears it. Like, does he even look at her face?

However, anyone reasonable would agree it's weird to get someone a life-sized cardboard cutout of an anime character they never talk about just because you saw one old poster somewhere in their apartment.\n\nSo when she didn't like the makeup either -- which he wouldn't have bought if he was paying attention to her face and saw she didn't wear makeup, unless he was trying to hint that he wanted her to wear it -- she tried to be nice about it, because she didn't want to hurt his feelings.

Physically space wise, mentally, that's a big step up. Its on par with body pillow level of waifuism. It would feel pretty cringe to have unless your love for the character can match.

It is the thought that counts, but the closer to you someone is, the more thought you usually put into it. If he was a co-worker or distant relative, then you can be courteous and just thank them and dispose of the gift at your convenience. When it's someone you're dating, it's best to let them know if you don't like something because most people would _want_ to know what their partner likes and dislikes, and would _want_ to get them gifts they'd actually love, not just pretend to.", "It's easier than ever to remember something your partner pointed out a while ago.

She didn't even say, \"It's very sweet of you, but I actually don't like that anime.\" She said, \"Oh, I don't really like cutouts, they kinda freak me out\" - because he would be sure to notice that she wasn't displaying it in her home and have questions about that.

I don't know her parents, but giving a weird weeb gift to your girlfriend in front of her parents could also have caused embarrassment, especially if it's something unusual like a life size cutout rather than something more sensible like a figurine. He could have tried to surprise her using new observations, rather than observations from before they even started dating. While he is still getting to know her he should put in more effort and communicate with her rather than just assume something he saw 10 months ago was something she is extremely passionate about. Trying to surprise someone you barely know is a recipe for disaster and you should be prepared for the gift to not be well received if you truly don't know them very well.\n\nSo the gift was not practical, potentially inappropriate, and when she told him these things he responded by getting offended and then eventually giving her the silent treatment.", "Ah I already read a few of OPs comments before replying to you.\n\nSo OPs comment about how she was not near him while texting her friend but he went up to her and purposely looked at her conversation with her friend.

I would want them to ask lol", "OP said the poster was in an out-of-the-way spot. It's also a bit weird to go from one poster, with zero conversation about the character, to cardboard cutout.

My dad loved buying stuff for my mom. He was the worst gift giver, though. Terrible taste too. But he really put a lot of love, effort and money into buying gifts. It made him really happy to think he\u2019d bought the \u201cperfect\u201d gift. My mom, understandably, never liked them and would tell him. He eventually stopped getting her things, understandably. Then, she would complain he never got her gifts anymore but who wants to get gifts for someone like that? And giving from a list is, IMO, as bad and as transactional as giving money. I understand that\u2019s what some people are into and to each their own, but why not just buy your own stuff, then?\n\nYou can think what you want about gifts but to me, I don\u2019t give two f***s about what\u2019s inside the wrapper. That you put one second of effort into getting me something is what I care about. I work and make enough to get myself anything I want so I don\u2019t need to depend on gifts to get what I want or need. Whatever the gift ends up being is of no importance. It doesn\u2019t show how much you love me or how well you know me or how much you care. You are the problem if you put all that significance into an object/ voluntary act of love/kindness. Love is how someone acts and how someone treats you in the day to day not what they gift you.", "See, 'men generally tend to'. Why? Because of testosterone? No, because society tells them not to show emotions and just ignore their dissappointment when it comes to gift giving. I assure you there are plenty of men who really appreciate a thoughtful gift. \n\nI don't care about people having a list if everyone involved is happy with that. I am opposing the idea that this is what men vs women are like. That women need to make such a list, so men can show some minimal effort. That men are not capable of gift giving. That women are the ones who are good at it. That's simply not true and a sexist trope.", "But OP could use the cutout. It's a decoration right? I'm not wearing this cardigan. Ever. I genuinely find this type of clothing repulsive. The same way you won't ever catch me in a turtle neck. \n\nI was in a similar situation to OP. Do you know what fatheads are?

I don't like cardigans. Infact I don't think she has ever seen me wear one because I never owned one. She said \"I saw this and thought you would look handsome in it, it matches those leather shoes you wear alot etc.. etc...\" I'm never going to wear it. But I'm not going to make her feel bad or uncomfortable. She thought about me and she tried. \"Thanks so much, it does look warm!\" Was my response. Not trying to make her feel bad. Kind of anecdotal but I never give my mom gifts. I give her gift cards because she is difficult and I know it's likely getting returned. My dad though, is always gracious whatever you get him. Could be socks. Could be tools. Etc... its a theme I at least observe. Even with girlfriends. Men don't generally make issues out of little things like this. It's not worth making someone feel bad over", "The bar is on the floor and people are still digging under it to justify his poor gifts.

And even with all that, she still thanked him, she just privately told him cutouts creep her out so he'd know she wasn't going to put it up. Her texting her friend is a complete nonissue too became it only became his concern because he looked at her phone. He hurt his own feelings here and now isn't talking to her because of it.

Love is how someone acts and how someone treats you in the day to day not what they gift you.\n\nNo one is a problem for placing value on gifts just like it's not a problem for you not to care about them. Gifts are supposed to be meaningful to the recipient. They are meant to show how much you love and care about them, that's why you're bothering to buy a gift in the first place. People show their love this way. \n\nA gift the recipient doesn't even like is always thoughtless. It shows you don't listen to your partner, or care to ask.\n\n> But he really put a lot of love, effort and money into buying gifts. It made him really happy to think he\u2019d bought the \u201cperfect\u201d gift.\n\nThis is the real problem. People who buy gifts for their own satisfaction. No amount of money or effort matters if the gift is thoughtless. The best gift I ever received was a love letter that I asked for.

If you buy me a frying pan and I already have a frying pan do you know what I do? I say thank you and then put it in the cabinets with my pots and use it if I ever need it. Not try to make you feel bad I already have one or I didn't want one. If what I really wanted was a saucepan ill go buy one. I have money. I am an adult. This exchanging of gifts is a formality. It's not a personal sleight.", "You can't \"go and exchange it later\" without knowledge of where it came from and a receipt, which can only be obtained by letting the person who bought the gift know you want to exchange it.\n\nGrow up, and learn that's it's not a personal attack to have different tastes and say so."]}
