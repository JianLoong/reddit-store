The people saying y t a because you have a poster up are crazy.  It is an exceedingly odd gift that I cannot imagine the vast majority of people would enjoy. Especially if you have never spoken about it.  Like you have to be pretty obsessed with a character to want a life sized cut out.  \n\nI guess he gets points for trying but... maybe make an amazon wish list or something for next time lmao", "NAH. A gift is not an obligation.  You are not required to like every gift you recieve. If you got something youre not excited about,  it's natural to feel disappointed. As long as you are polite,  you are not an asshole. Maybe wait until he's out of the room to text your friend next time. \n\nHe clearly tried. I can follow his thought process but man,  you don't give someone a life size cutout unless you are certain the recipient will love it. Think that was a clear misfire on his part. That being said,  it sucks knowing that someone didn't like the gift you gave them so his disappointment is understandable. \n\nMy first few gifts to my now wife were also hilariously bad.  It took time but i eventually learned what clues to look for and what was really meaningful to her.... and she learned how to drop better clues.

The cut out is based on you having a poster up, if you had taken that poster down or even explained to your bf that it was your ex's and not yours be wouldn't have gone out of his way to find a cut out of it for you. He paid attention to the shit you have and tried to get you a cut out of something he really thought you liked. \n\nAs for the make up pallette, it sounds like he tried to get you colours you didn't already own so you could have more variety. Why would you want repeats of colours you already have? It legit sounds like he tried and you could have thanked him and explained that the poster wasn't yours instead of messaging a friend to complain - a complaint your bf could see.", "ESH, probably. What did you get him for Christmas? Was he gracious in accepting them? After 3 months dating he should have known that poster wasn\u2019t yours (he should have known this because you should have told him). Makeup is also just a hard thing to buy for someone else, so I see what he was trying to do, and I understand it was a miss for you, but yeah\u2026 I dunno. I think you both should have had more conversations about Christmas to avoid hurt feelings. \n\nMy husband and I did our first Christmas together when we\u2019d been dating 4 months. We set a strict budget and expectations on the gifts being small. I don\u2019t quite recall all the things, but it included him getting me a sweater and a loose leaf tea sampler, me getting him a rolling pin and whiskey stones, and some other small things.", "It\u2019s really disturbing how y\u2019all are going to bat for the emotions of some random dude who won\u2019t see your replies.\n\nYou\u2019re not the asshole, but neither is he. You should be able to communicate when gifts miss the mark from someone you\u2019re supposed to be most comfortable with. If you can\u2019t do that, you\u2019re not with the correct person. Holding it in only builds resentment.

I don't care what she had hanging on her wall. this dude is capable of communicating and should have asked. op isn't an asshole just cause she never got around to taking the damn thing down. I'll say NAH cause his intentions were good, but you gotta have to a talk with him about communicating and not just making assumptions cause you ain't been together long enough for him to know you that well", "Yta the poster was never removed, he had every reason to think he was getting you something you\u2019d appreciate and would show that he is observing things he thinks you like. I get being disappointed but he did put thoughts in and it\u2019s sweet", "NTA, I\u2019m shocked at all the Y T As. Gifting is about the recipient, not the giver. My first Christmas with my SO, they did something similar and went over the top with a bunch of gifts that I had no use for (things like clothes, I\u2019m a very slim and petite person and none of the clothes fit me, they were all the smallest size so there was no exchanging for another size or anything). Another year they bought me a very expensive gift for a hobby that I used to have but haven\u2019t touched in years. They got upset when I asked to return them all, despite me making it clear that while I appreciated the thought, the items weren\u2019t things I had use for. Over time they came to understand and now they just ask me what I want and get that for me. \n\nI get being bummed if you get someone a gift you\u2019re excited for and they don\u2019t react the way you want, but the gift isn\u2019t for you, it\u2019s for them. If someone doesn\u2019t like their gift I\u2019m still happy to give them a gift receipt or return it and get something else that they like. It\u2019s possible to both be grateful and acknowledge that it\u2019s not something you have use for. In a relatively new relationship, I get why you didn\u2019t feel comfortable telling him you didn\u2019t like the makeup palette, especially after he got upset when you told him you didn\u2019t like the first gift. Like what\u2019s the alternative, you say thanks, don\u2019t set up the cut out or touch the makeup palette and lie when he asks where they are or if you\u2019ve used them? That\u2019s a lose-lose situation", "NTA. A lifesize cut out is a super weird gif, especially since you only had one poster about Miku, and never spoke about her. Would be more understandable if you had a shelf full of Miku stuff. He didn't even ask if you like her.

He obviously thought it was something that you had that you appreciated so he was trying to do a surprise and find something unique and interesting and different. And I totally agree with your boyfriend about talking to another friend about it or texting another friend about your disappointment. He should\u2019ve been nowhere around you, and it should not have been such a crushing ordeal for you to have to try to find someone to talk to about it, or to gripe about it immediately. You were absolutely ungrateful for the thought and effort that he put into it. Just because you don\u2019t like the character or don\u2019t like cut outs doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t do a lot of work and put a lot of effort into finding it or getting it. You are completely overlooking that part of things- he thought that this was something that you enjoyed. It is an unfortunate situation, but one could\u2019ve easily and gently spoke to him about and explained why you didn\u2019t care for it. Especially since your relationship is so new.  You being picky about the make up is just that. It almost seems petty that you\u2019re upset about the make up palette because you don\u2019t like all the colors in it but I understand where you\u2019re coming from. I think the disappointment from the first gift got your hopes up for the second gift and then you were disappointed again. I do understand that you gave him some hints about what you might like, but it sounds like he was trying to do something that would be a big surprise. So if he got you a bunch of things that you listed, it wouldn\u2019t seem special or seem like a surprise probably. I think you should just talk to him about why he got the things that he got. And I think you owe him a huge apology for basically going behind his back and griping about things that he made an effort to do for you. That wasn\u2019t very kind or loving.", "NAH. \n\nYou're both pretty young, and it can be challenging to really hone in on good gift giving, especially if it wasn't really a focus when growing up. So I don't think I would read into him not nailing the gifts this Christmas. The silent treatment seems like an overreaction to me though, but I think a conversation could clear things up between the two of you down the line. \n\nBut you're not wrong for disliking the gifts either. You can't help what you like/dislike. And while he found out that you disliked the gifts, you didn't act like that when you opened them and didn't intend for him to find out.", "Originally was ready to say N AH or even N T A but seeing that you\u2019ve only been together for three months, YTA. At that point you\u2019re still figuring out each others interests and the stakes or expectations shouldn\u2019t be high for gift giving. It sounds like he was going off of what little he had for your interests and wanted to surprise you by not asking clarifying questions on what you\u2019d have wanted, maybe esp because 3 months is definitely in that gray area window of gift giving in a relationship. You\u2019re expecting him to have been a total mindreader", "NTA and it\u2019s not your fault he\u2019s sulking. My husband has to take my daughter for purchasing for me. Cook his favourite meal and tell him how you feel about him then suggest that you each write lists and pick from them. You have to be specific though. \u201cSun glasses\u201d is useless. You have to give brand, model, colour etc", "NAH. I think other commenters have covered the Miku cut-out pretty thoroughly, so I'll address the makeup one. \n\nI get where you're coming from with the makeup gift because, as you've said, you don't even really wear makeup. That kind of makes the act of him giving you makeup read like generic \"girl gift.\" Like when dudes only ever gift their wives cooking and cleaning appliances year after year (I mean specifically when they have not ever communicated an interest in receiving such items). I do also understand where people are saying that you guys haven't been dating for very long, so without much to go on, he did try to find something he hoped you would like. \n\nThe makeup thing reminds me of a guy I dated a long time ago who would randomly show up at my job with gifts. Sounds super sweet, right? However, back then, I didn't like receiving gifts and told him as much, since receiving gifts used to make me uncomfortable (which I did explain to him.) We'd known each other for at least a year at this point and chatted a lot every single day (sometimes in person, sometimes via text), so we did know each other pretty well.\n\nIn addition to bringing me gifts when I said I didn't want any in the first place, the things he got me were all really random things that he thought a girl would like in general. He didn't bother to take time to think about what *I* would like. Because of this, he just so happened to get me things that I really hated and had explicitly expressed dislike of previously. It was hard to be grateful for these things, as they made me feel like he just didn't listen to me or pay attention to what I'd said. \n\nI don't think either of you are really assholes in this situation. I completely understand being utterly baffled and disappointed by these gifts as you have no interest in them, but I do think it was nice that he paid attention to notice your Miku poster and getting something Miku-related *was* actually a good idea only his part when he'd seen something of it hanging up in your home. He just missed the mark unintentionally. (Okay, gifting someone a cardboard cut-out of anything is a really odd choice tbh, but he did try to pick something that would have meaning to you.) You're not an asshole for venting to your friend about the situation, either. It's just an awkward situation all the way around, but I'm sure both of you will feel a bit better about it after re-discussing it in the near future, perhaps after the initial hurt feelings die down a bit.", "NAH\n\nYou were disappointed cause you didn't think his gifts were thoughtful about what you'd like. \n\nHe is upset cause his first gift to you was an attempt at doing that, even though it didn't work. \n\nJust give yourselves time to cool off, then talk about it calmly. It's early on in your relationship. You can work this out.", "ESH. Look, you had a poster and never mentioned anything about it. So I would also have assumed that you would like it if you don't remove it.\n\nThat said, a full-blown cutout? Not like a figurine or anything? That's just a bad idea. Who the fuck has room for that? I would not give that to someone based on the solitary poster. If you had a room full of her stuff? Yes. One poster? Get another poster, or a plushie or a figurine, or a funko pop. \n\nMakeup for someone who doesn't wear any is a bad idea. Never mind your colors because you may need neutrals at a formal event, but if you barely wear any, is like giving a guy a tie randomly. \n\nHe sucks at gift giving, you suck at communicating your wants and likes. And no, him eavesdropping and then complaining about you not liking his presents, making him upset is also not a thing.\n\nYou guys need to learn to communicate and grow in a relationship before trying to be seriously committed to someone.", "NTA those are very weird and unpractical gifts", "YTA.\n\nHave you ever heard of the saying, \"it's the thought that counts\"?\n\nThe fact that he assumed you liked the character is 100% your fault. \n\nBut the biggest reason you're the AH is actually the text. You want to talk to your friend about it, fine. But did you have to do it right then and there? It's not easy to \"notice\" what someone is typing on their phone unless you're literally right next to each other. You couldn't wait until you were 5 feet away from him before texting?\n\nI actually find it hard to believe it was an accident.", "In the future, make an Amazon wish list with the sizes, colors and whatever details of the things you DO want. Let him know about the list and choose to order from it. You will always get the things that YOU want.", "His choice of a cut-out was odd, but if he saw the poster and assumed it was yours (who wouldn't), then that was a real attempt to see the real you and get a gift you would appreciate. If you believe that it's the thought that counts, then his thoughts should count -- he wanted you to be happy and he went out of his way to find something he thought you liked, then got a present based on that information. Do you realize how rare that can be? I hope you don't have to find out. And his second present...it's daring to buy makeup for someone without foreknowledge, to be sure. But hardly thoughtless.\n\nHis choices were swings and misses, and that's at least partly on you where the strange background of the poster is concerned, as he didn't know any of that. But while he tried and didn't hit the mark, YTA here.", "INFO: How long have you been together? I think this comes down to whether he should've been able to know that you wouldn't be into thiese\n\nIf you've been together for awhile, he should be able to observe at least these two things\n\n1. You dont talk about that anime much, if ever (implies you arent into it)\n2.

I've been with my wife for 7 years, 3 married. Our first holiday season together, was not our finest, and I'd hazard a guess that most aren't for first time couples. You've been together only 3mo. That's barely enough time for him to truely get to know you and the types of things you *actually* like getting as gifts. And given how you reacted, if I was him, I wouldn't really be all that encouraged to try again, let alone let the relationship continue. If he gives your another chance, maybe instead if sh*ng all over the things he gives you, gently give constructive criticism and communicate the things you really want as gifts. For example, my wife and I have a sort of inside joke, that after I spent so much money on her engagement ring, she wouldn't be getting any more jewelry from me again because we couldn't afford it. Especially after this year with the birth of our first child. But, I've always known it wasn't really a joke and she really did want another piece of jewelry from me, didn't even have to be expensive. So this year, I hopped on Etsy and found a very affordable 14k white gold necklace with an elephant pendant (her favorite animal) and got it customized with her name in it. She adores it. Anyways. If you want this to last, give the poor guy a fighting chance next time and actually just tell him what you want.", "NTA youve been talking ab stuff you would like, he shouldve put more thought into your gifts", "NTA people are getting way to hung up on the fact you had a poster and ignore the fact that his gift was a life sized cutout. Even IF you had been a fan that is not the sort of thing you give someone unless you are 100% sure it's something they want. A normal gift would have been a mouse mat or another poster or a figurine or countless other options, not something that takes up a huge space in your home.", "NTA for any feelings you have.

Even to your friend, you could have expressed frustration, while still complimenting his effort.  Had you simply thanked him (emphasizing his effort), and kindly explained the history of the poster, it might have softened the blow.\n\nIt's also important that you've only been together for three months, so at this point you still have a lot to learn about each other.
