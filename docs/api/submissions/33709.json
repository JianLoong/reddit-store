{"id": 33709, "submission_id": "18r0mbn", "title": "AITA for not liking the gifts my bf got me?", "selftext": "I (21f) received gifts from my boyfriend (24m) today as my christmas present. I kinda knew from the start before I even opened them, that I wouldn\u2019t like them. I just had that feeling. Turns out that feeling was right. \n\nHe got me two gifts. One gift was a giant life size cutout of Hatsune Miku and the other was a makeup palette. \n\nThe first gift just kinda blew my mind. I\u2019ve never once hinted that this would be something i\u2019m interested in, nor have I ever directly mentioned/said anything about liking the character. This gift was based off a poster I had in my old apartment that my ex left when he moved out. He was the fan of the character and I was just left with a poster I had bought for him. When we left my parents, I told him that I wasn\u2019t very fond of it because I think cutouts are creepy and I didn\u2019t want to set up and get scared by it randomly in the middle of the night. He kinda got upset by this even though i did thank him for it. \n\n\nThe second gift was alright but when it comes to makeup, I\u2019m very picky about the stuff I use. I\u2019m into more pinks and bright colors then the more tone down colors that the palette had. This was also another thing I didn\u2019t specifically mentioned I wanted. I didn\u2019t say anything about not liking it and just thanked him.\n\nIt feels like He assumed i would enjoy this stuff when I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t wear makeup often and I\u2019m not fond or random things that could freak me out by just being in the corner all freaky like. I texted my friend to ask her opinion on this and he caught a glimpse of my telling her about the presents and how I didn\u2019t like them. He told me he\u2019s upset I went t to her instead of telling him but I already felt bad for telling him that I didn\u2019t really like the first thing, so saying I didn\u2019t \nthe second one just seemed like a dick move and I was just gonna keep it to myself. \n\nNow he\u2019s just giving me the silent treatment even after I explained that I felt shitty telling him I didn\u2019t like the things he bought me. I know i should be grateful but I went to lengths for his gift and it feels like he didn\u2019t listen to anything I\u2019ve been saying I\u2019ve wanted in the 3 months i\u2019ve been talking about random stuff i would like. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit:\n\nTo answer some things:\n\nWhat did I get him? I got him a $100 gift certificate to his favorite tattoo artist because he has a tattoo he\u2019s been wanting to get finished. I would have put more on it if I had the money but I\u2019m flat broke right now due to house bills.\n\nThat stupid poster: That poster was something I had in my old apartment untilAugust of this year. It was hidden behind my door of the bedroom of the apartment. I no longer live in that apartment. He watched me tear the poster to shreds when I was moving things out because he was one of the people helping me move out of that apartment because that apartment was where my ex boyfriend ( the owner of the poster) abused me. \n\n\nThe gifts: I never once said I didn\u2019t thank him for them. I did, I told him thank you for the gifts when I opened them and told him privately after the first gift the story behind why i\u2019m not a fan of Miku. He was upset by this but understood. I told him how I was a little scared to open the second one because I didn\u2019t want to not like it and make him feel bad if I didn\u2019t. He told me that he \u201cbet his life\u201d I would like it. When It turned out I didn\u2019t like it, I messaged my friend back because she was asking about the second gift because I sent her a photo of the first one. He just happened to look at my phone when I was distracted and saw the conversation and got mad. \n\nYou live with your bf of 3 months??? I have a house which I bought in August and had ask my bf( who was my friend at the time) to be my roommate to make it easier to pay bills. He ended up asking me out in September. Yes we live together, but no it wasn\u2019t because we were dating. We were close friends (even if we had only met a couple months prior) and I need someone to help pay bills. I had another that was gonna move in but she backed out because she wanted her own space with her boyfriend.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nI can\u2019t get to everyone, though from what i\u2019ve read (which is a lot, I didn\u2019t expect this to blow up) Majority is that I\u2019m NTA. \n\nFor those that think I am entitled and ungrateful, that\u2019s to each their own. I told him specifically not to get me anything at all because I wasn\u2019t able to afford much. I was only able to get his gift out of sheer luck! I didn\u2019t want anything but I knew he was going to get me something no matter what I said, so whenever I saw something I liked either while we were out or if I saw it online, I\u2019d send it to him or point it it out saying this is something I think is cool. \n\nI never ever mentioned Miku in any conversation ever. I have however mentioned other anime characters that I enjoy! I\u2019ve talked about countless things I enjoy with him. He knows how much of a fan of Hello Kitty I mean he bought me socks randomly because I was sad about something. That\u2019s something I would of appreciated as a cardboard cutout (even though they are still creepy) I\u2019ve also mentioned that I need a makeup container so I could move my makeup off the floor of the bathroom. I never ask for makeup because i\u2019m picky about my makeup because I have sensitive skin. \n\nI hope this edit helps people understand better!  I did text him this morning after I had left for work that I was sorry for hurting him by and that it wasn\u2019t intentional. I also explained why I didn\u2019t like the gifts and told him I\u2019d make him his favorite food to make up for upsetting him.

The people saying y t a because you have a poster up are crazy.  It is an exceedingly odd gift that I cannot imagine the vast majority of people would enjoy. Especially if you have never spoken about it.  Like you have to be pretty obsessed with a character to want a life sized cut out.  \n\nI guess he gets points for trying but... maybe make an amazon wish list or something for next time lmao", "NAH. A gift is not an obligation.  You are not required to like every gift you recieve. If you got something youre not excited about,  it's natural to feel disappointed. As long as you are polite,  you are not an asshole. Maybe wait until he's out of the room to text your friend next time. \n\nHe clearly tried. I can follow his thought process but man,  you don't give someone a life size cutout unless you are certain the recipient will love it. Think that was a clear misfire on his part. That being said,  it sucks knowing that someone didn't like the gift you gave them so his disappointment is understandable. \n\nMy first few gifts to my now wife were also hilariously bad.  It took time but i eventually learned what clues to look for and what was really meaningful to her.... and she learned how to drop better clues. Havent had a complaint about gifts in near a decade.", "YTA and high maintenance. \n\nI don't think this is a useful relationship for either of you.", "So did you leave that poster up long enough for him to assume you liked the character?", "ESH honestly.  you because you told him you disliked the gifts. you could have just taken them and not used them or tucked them away somewhere.  him because he clearly didnt really know what you liked and just assumed some things.", "Nta", "Yta, only cuz it sounds like he actually tried to put in effort. The cut out is based on you having a poster up, if you had taken that poster down or even explained to your bf that it was your ex's and not yours be wouldn't have gone out of his way to find a cut out of it for you. He paid attention to the shit you have and tried to get you a cut out of something he really thought you liked. \n\nAs for the make up pallette, it sounds like he tried to get you colours you didn't already own so you could have more variety. Why would you want repeats of colours you already have? It legit sounds like he tried and you could have thanked him and explained that the poster wasn't yours instead of messaging a friend to complain - a complaint your bf could see.", "ESH, probably. What did you get him for Christmas? Was he gracious in accepting them? After 3 months dating he should have known that poster wasn\u2019t yours (he should have known this because you should have told him). Makeup is also just a hard thing to buy for someone else, so I see what he was trying to do, and I understand it was a miss for you, but yeah\u2026 I dunno. I think you both should have had more conversations about Christmas to avoid hurt feelings. \n\nMy husband and I did our first Christmas together when we\u2019d been dating 4 months. We set a strict budget and expectations on the gifts being small. I don\u2019t quite recall all the things, but it included him getting me a sweater and a loose leaf tea sampler, me getting him a rolling pin and whiskey stones, and some other small things.", "It\u2019s really disturbing how y\u2019all are going to bat for the emotions of some random dude who won\u2019t see your replies.\n\nYou\u2019re not the asshole, but neither is he. You should be able to communicate when gifts miss the mark from someone you\u2019re supposed to be most comfortable with. If you can\u2019t do that, you\u2019re not with the correct person. Holding it in only builds resentment. You don\u2019t owe him an apology for being honest. \n\nI\u2019m so sick of this fucking subreddit and y\u2019all being so ridiculously black and white about EVERYTHING.", "some of ya'll are out of pocket. this is a three month relationship. I don't care what she had hanging on her wall. this dude is capable of communicating and should have asked. op isn't an asshole just cause she never got around to taking the damn thing down. I'll say NAH cause his intentions were good, but you gotta have to a talk with him about communicating and not just making assumptions cause you ain't been together long enough for him to know you that well", "Yta the poster was never removed, he had every reason to think he was getting you something you\u2019d appreciate and would show that he is observing things he thinks you like. I get being disappointed but he did put thoughts in and it\u2019s sweet", "NTA, I\u2019m shocked at all the Y T As. Gifting is about the recipient, not the giver. My first Christmas with my SO, they did something similar and went over the top with a bunch of gifts that I had no use for (things like clothes, I\u2019m a very slim and petite person and none of the clothes fit me, they were all the smallest size so there was no exchanging for another size or anything). Another year they bought me a very expensive gift for a hobby that I used to have but haven\u2019t touched in years. They got upset when I asked to return them all, despite me making it clear that while I appreciated the thought, the items weren\u2019t things I had use for. Over time they came to understand and now they just ask me what I want and get that for me. \n\nI get being bummed if you get someone a gift you\u2019re excited for and they don\u2019t react the way you want, but the gift isn\u2019t for you, it\u2019s for them. If someone doesn\u2019t like their gift I\u2019m still happy to give them a gift receipt or return it and get something else that they like. It\u2019s possible to both be grateful and acknowledge that it\u2019s not something you have use for. In a relatively new relationship, I get why you didn\u2019t feel comfortable telling him you didn\u2019t like the makeup palette, especially after he got upset when you told him you didn\u2019t like the first gift. Like what\u2019s the alternative, you say thanks, don\u2019t set up the cut out or touch the makeup palette and lie when he asks where they are or if you\u2019ve used them? That\u2019s a lose-lose situation", "NTA. A lifesize cut out is a super weird gif, especially since you only had one poster about Miku, and never spoke about her. Would be more understandable if you had a shelf full of Miku stuff. He didn't even ask if you like her.

He obviously thought it was something that you had that you appreciated so he was trying to do a surprise and find something unique and interesting and different. And I totally agree with your boyfriend about talking to another friend about it or texting another friend about your disappointment. He should\u2019ve been nowhere around you, and it should not have been such a crushing ordeal for you to have to try to find someone to talk to about it, or to gripe about it immediately. You were absolutely ungrateful for the thought and effort that he put into it. Just because you don\u2019t like the character or don\u2019t like cut outs doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t do a lot of work and put a lot of effort into finding it or getting it. You are completely overlooking that part of things- he thought that this was something that you enjoyed. It is an unfortunate situation, but one could\u2019ve easily and gently spoke to him about and explained why you didn\u2019t care for it. Especially since your relationship is so new.  You being picky about the make up is just that. It almost seems petty that you\u2019re upset about the make up palette because you don\u2019t like all the colors in it but I understand where you\u2019re coming from. I think the disappointment from the first gift got your hopes up for the second gift and then you were disappointed again. I do understand that you gave him some hints about what you might like, but it sounds like he was trying to do something that would be a big surprise. So if he got you a bunch of things that you listed, it wouldn\u2019t seem special or seem like a surprise probably. I think you should just talk to him about why he got the things that he got. And I think you owe him a huge apology for basically going behind his back and griping about things that he made an effort to do for you. That wasn\u2019t very kind or loving.", "NAH. \n\nYou're both pretty young, and it can be challenging to really hone in on good gift giving, especially if it wasn't really a focus when growing up. So I don't think I would read into him not nailing the gifts this Christmas. The silent treatment seems like an overreaction to me though, but I think a conversation could clear things up between the two of you down the line. \n\nBut you're not wrong for disliking the gifts either. You can't help what you like/dislike. And while he found out that you disliked the gifts, you didn't act like that when you opened them and didn't intend for him to find out.", "Originally was ready to say N AH or even N T A but seeing that you\u2019ve only been together for three months, YTA. At that point you\u2019re still figuring out each others interests and the stakes or expectations shouldn\u2019t be high for gift giving. It sounds like he was going off of what little he had for your interests and wanted to surprise you by not asking clarifying questions on what you\u2019d have wanted, maybe esp because 3 months is definitely in that gray area window of gift giving in a relationship. You\u2019re expecting him to have been a total mindreader", "NTA and it\u2019s not your fault he\u2019s sulking. My husband has to take my daughter for purchasing for me. Cook his favourite meal and tell him how you feel about him then suggest that you each write lists and pick from them. You have to be specific though. \u201cSun glasses\u201d is useless. You have to give brand, model, colour etc", "NAH. I think other commenters have covered the Miku cut-out pretty thoroughly, so I'll address the makeup one. \n\nI get where you're coming from with the makeup gift because, as you've said, you don't even really wear makeup. That kind of makes the act of him giving you makeup read like generic \"girl gift.\" Like when dudes only ever gift their wives cooking and cleaning appliances year after year (I mean specifically when they have not ever communicated an interest in receiving such items). I do also understand where people are saying that you guys haven't been dating for very long, so without much to go on, he did try to find something he hoped you would like. \n\nThe makeup thing reminds me of a guy I dated a long time ago who would randomly show up at my job with gifts. Sounds super sweet, right? However, back then, I didn't like receiving gifts and told him as much, since receiving gifts used to make me uncomfortable (which I did explain to him.) We'd known each other for at least a year at this point and chatted a lot every single day (sometimes in person, sometimes via text), so we did know each other pretty well.\n\nIn addition to bringing me gifts when I said I didn't want any in the first place, the things he got me were all really random things that he thought a girl would like in general. He didn't bother to take time to think about what *I* would like. Because of this, he just so happened to get me things that I really hated and had explicitly expressed dislike of previously. It was hard to be grateful for these things, as they made me feel like he just didn't listen to me or pay attention to what I'd said. \n\nI don't think either of you are really assholes in this situation. I completely understand being utterly baffled and disappointed by these gifts as you have no interest in them, but I do think it was nice that he paid attention to notice your Miku poster and getting something Miku-related *was* actually a good idea on his part when he'd seen something of it hanging up in your home. He just missed the mark unintentionally. (Okay, gifting someone a cardboard cut-out of anything is a really odd choice tbh, but he did try to pick something that would have meaning to you.) You're not an asshole for venting to your friend about the situation, either. It's just an awkward situation all the way around, but I'm sure both of you will feel a bit better about it after re-discussing it in the near future, perhaps after the initial hurt feelings die down a bit.\n\n*Edit: a typo", "NAH\n\nYou were disappointed cause you didn't think his gifts were thoughtful about what you'd like. \n\nHe is upset cause his first gift to you was an attempt at doing that, even though it didn't work. \n\nJust give yourselves time to cool off, then talk about it calmly. It's early on in your relationship. You can work this out.", "ESH. Look, you had a poster and never mentioned anything about it. So I would also have assumed that you would like it if you don't remove it.\n\nThat said, a full-blown cutout? Not like a figurine or anything? That's just a bad idea. Who the fuck has room for that? I would not give that to someone based on the solitary poster. If you had a room full of her stuff? Yes. One poster? Get another poster, or a plushie or a figurine, or a funko pop. \n\nMakeup for someone who doesn't wear any is a bad idea. Never mind your colors because you may need neutrals at a formal event, but if you barely wear any, is like giving a guy a tie randomly. \n\nHe sucks at gift giving, you suck at communicating your wants and likes. And no, him eavesdropping and then complaining about you not liking his presents, making him upset is also not a thing.\n\nYou guys need to learn to communicate and grow in a relationship before trying to be seriously committed to someone.", "NTA those are very weird and unpractical gifts", "YTA.\n\nHave you ever heard of the saying, \"it's the thought that counts\"?\n\nThe fact that he assumed you liked the character is 100% your fault. \n\nBut the biggest reason you're the AH is actually the text.

You will always get the things that YOU want.", "His choice of a cut-out was odd, but if he saw the poster and assumed it was yours (who wouldn't), then that was a real attempt to see the real you and get a gift you would appreciate. If you believe that it's the thought that counts, then his thoughts should count -- he wanted you to be happy and he went out of his way to find something he thought you liked, then got a present based on that information. Do you realize how rare that can be? I hope you don't have to find out. And his second present...it's daring to buy makeup for someone without foreknowledge, to be sure.

And given how you reacted, if I was him, I wouldn't really be all that encouraged to try again, let alone let the relationship continue. If he gives your another chance, maybe instead if sh*ng all over the things he gives you, gently give constructive criticism and communicate the things you really want as gifts. For example, my wife and I have a sort of inside joke, that after I spent so much money on her engagement ring, she wouldn't be getting any more jewelry from me again because we couldn't afford it. Especially after this year with the birth of our first child. But, I've always known it wasn't really a joke and she really did want another piece of jewelry from me, didn't even have to be expensive. So this year, I hopped on Etsy and found a very affordable 14k white gold necklace with an elephant pendant (her favorite animal) and got it customized with her name in it. She adores it. Anyways.

Even IF you had been a fan that is not the sort of thing you give someone unless you are 100% sure it's something they want.

But a life size cut out of a character you presumably haven't mentioned fondly in your time together is a bit strange. The make up pallet is a bit more forgivable, since it's just a generic gift for someone you haven't been seeing so long and know does occasionally wear make up, as occasional wearers tend to be less colourful, so that's a reasonable guess, although again, make up can be very personal so he should have found a way do a bit of research on you, not just relied on generics. None of this makes him an AH, just a bit clueless. He's not even an AH for being upset you didn't like the gifts, that's kind of a natural disappointment. Him getting sulky and silent treatmenting you though, after telling you to tell him if you disliked the gifts, that's the slightly AH behaviour.\n\nYou were gracious in receiving.

Maybe agree not to hint and to outright say \"This is what I want for my birthday/ Christmas\". Maybe agree that you'll both do wish lists from now on, and that one present should be from there even if a punt gets taken on a second one.

I'm the type to easily forget things people say and I am oblivious to a lot of things, however, when I want to get something for someone I try and make notes of stuff they love. For example, a coworker would tell me his favorite cake is oreo ice cream cake and he liked pokemon so I would get him stuff involving those two things, if I noticed another coworker looking at something they like I'd try to get them something similar. My point being, my ND ass really struggles at \"noticing the little things\" often but because I care I make an extra effort to remember things they mentioned. I think he really tried by remembering that poster, that's actually impressive he remembered something so small and shows he was trying to put in the effort. The issue was, he never asked you about it to gauge your actual interest, there is a lot to be said for assuming. For instance, I have been given gifts of fandoms I don't care for, but I put them on display because they're gifts and mean something to me. Without asking, the automatic assumption is that I enjoy this thing.\nHoly crap I'm sorry I'm very high and can't stop rambling, basically I think more effort could have been had on his end and you're NTA for feeling a bit sad that it felt like you were putting more effort than him. It's a common thing in relationships to feel one sided, again I don't think it was ever his intention to miss the mark but this could be a perfect learning moment - - he now knows to learn more about what you like first OR just ask what you want.

There's definitely a part of me that might be upset that someone pretended they really liked a gift I gave them when they literally hated it, but ultimately I would be upset that I didn't put enough thought into it.\n\nBF might be the asshole here, and I don't mean that in a typical reddit way, I mean the bad gifts were already something to consider, his reaction is something else to consider.", "It\u2019s tricky because you don\u2019t want to keep recording gifts you don\u2019t really have a use for.

And the same is *usually* true for platonic friendships as well. \n\nHonestly the fact that he's a guy in his early 20's, and has actually been observing you enough to even venture into more sentimental territory is already a plus. He will only get more observant from here on out.

As a lady I'd have realized that and said \"ya know, I'm not sure what she prefers, but it *is* winter, so darker hues are suitable for the time of year\", added to the fact that if you're not super sure the EXACT colors someone likes, it's a safer bet to avoid overly loud colors when gifting. At least that allows you to make them more loud and accentuated if need be.\n\nYou were nice about it, but it's still an odd thing to be hung up on when you've only been together 3 months.

However, anyone reasonable would agree it's weird to get someone a life-sized cardboard cutout of an anime character they never talk about just because you saw one old poster somewhere in their apartment.\n\nSo when she didn't like the makeup either -- which he wouldn't have bought if he was paying attention to her face and saw she didn't wear makeup, unless he was trying to hint that he wanted her to wear it -- she tried to be nice about it, because she didn't want to hurt his feelings.

Physically space wise, mentally, that's a big step up. Its on par with body pillow level of waifuism. It would feel pretty cringe to have unless your love for the character can match.

Though that's just my take from her wording. \ud83e\udd37\n\nAlso, if you are truly trying to surprise someone, you try to stay away from hints.  In my experience, some of the best presents I've given and received are not the ones that were asked for or hinted at, but the one's you remember from an off comment or an observation.  Something that shows you truly paying attention.\n\nI might agree on the silent treatment.  If he's taking time to collect himself, that's fine.

The cut-out, while a weird gift, at least involves something he _thought_ she liked. But the make-up is like getting a gamer friend who's into _Call of Duty_ fucking _Hatoful Boyfriend_ instead because they're both in the same very broad category. It is the thought that counts, but the closer to you someone is, the more thought you usually put into it. If he was a co-worker or distant relative, then you can be courteous and just thank them and dispose of the gift at your convenience.

I don't know her parents, but giving a weird weeb gift to your girlfriend in front of her parents could also have caused embarrassment, especially if it's something unusual like a life size cutout rather than something more sensible like a figurine. He could have tried to surprise her using new observations, rather than observations from before they even started dating. While he is still getting to know her he should put in more effort and communicate with her rather than just assume something he saw 10 months ago was something she is extremely passionate about. Trying to surprise someone you barely know is a recipe for disaster and you should be prepared for the gift to not be well received if you truly don't know them very well.\n\nSo the gift was not practical, potentially inappropriate, and when she told him these things he responded by getting offended and then eventually giving her the silent treatment.", "Ah I already read a few of OPs comments before replying to you.\n\nSo OPs comment about how she was not near him while texting her friend but he went up to her and purposely looked at her conversation with her friend.

Then, she would complain he never got her gifts anymore but who wants to get gifts for someone like that? And giving from a list is, IMO, as bad and as transactional as giving money. I understand that\u2019s what some people are into and to each their own, but why not just buy your own stuff, then?\n\nYou can think what you want about gifts but to me, I don\u2019t give two f***s about what\u2019s inside the wrapper. That you put one second of effort into getting me something is what I care about. I work and make enough to get myself anything I want so I don\u2019t need to depend on gifts to get what I want or need. Whatever the gift ends up being is of no importance. It doesn\u2019t show how much you love me or how well you know me or how much you care. You are the problem if you put all that significance into an object/ voluntary act of love/kindness. Love is how someone acts and how someone treats you in the day to day not what they gift you.", "See, 'men generally tend to'. Why? Because of testosterone? No, because society tells them not to show emotions and just ignore their dissappointment when it comes to gift giving. I assure you there are plenty of men who really appreciate a thoughtful gift. \n\nI don't care about people having a list if everyone involved is happy with that. I am opposing the idea that this is what men vs women are like. That women need to make such a list, so men can show some minimal effort. That men are not capable of gift giving. That women are the ones who are good at it. That's simply not true and a sexist trope.", "But OP could use the cutout. It's a decoration right? I'm not wearing this cardigan. Ever. I genuinely find this type of clothing repulsive. The same way you won't ever catch me in a turtle neck. \n\nI was in a similar situation to OP. Do you know what fatheads are?

But I'm not going to make her feel bad or uncomfortable. She thought about me and she tried. \"Thanks so much, it does look warm!\" Was my response. Not trying to make her feel bad. Kind of anecdotal but I never give my mom gifts. I give her gift cards because she is difficult and I know it's likely getting returned. My dad though, is always gracious whatever you get him.

Why is he reading the texts of a girl he's only dated for 3 months, though?", "I know, right? I\u2019m not sure why this opinion is popping up a lot here. A life sized cutout is an extreme present\u2026 it\u2019s really not a normal thing to get just because someone is a fan of a character.\n\nI\u2019m thinking Reddit is filled with poor gift givers.", "Yeah, I\u2019d have to be pretty obsessed with something to warrant having a life sized cutout lol", "he sounds abusive? lmao come on now this is a major reddit comment", "He needs to apologize for giving her the silent treatment. She is allowed to mirror her feelings to a good friend. She has done nothing wrong.", "Where did she say she rarely wears it? Cus that isn't mentioned at all in the post she made", "\"Badmouthing\"? She vented that she didn't like a gift, but she didn't want to hurt his feelings. What part of that is \"badmouthing\"?\n\nFurthermore, why the FUCK is he reading her text messages when they've only been dating for 3 months and he doesn't even know her well enough to buy her a decent gift?", "Okay you managed to make Elf on the Shelf even more creepy :)", "No that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying at all. Read it again.", "You clearly didn't read the post properly then. \n\nHe didn't \"look through her phone\", he glanced at it while she was still texting her friend, and it wasn't her friend who asked. \n\nShe asked her friend to give an opinion on the situation.", "where does it say she tore it down and he saw? /gen", "She doesn't wear makeup though... So it almost comes across like he's hinting that he wants her to do that?", "Well I just know I hated it.", "Weird and extreme would be like a sex toy themed like the character or something like that. I wouldn't exactly go with a cutout because I am not a fan of buying people big decorative stuff, but it's not extreme. If she has a poster it's not weird to think she might want something not much bigger she can put on the wall as well. It's just a slab of cardboard. It's not a 3D printed figure made of gold. \n\nAlso he bought her two things. And she hated both. Even if there was some unwritten rule against cutouts, how do you explain the other problem she has with gifts in general?", "I think the fact that she tore it to shreds when she moved out right in front of him, would be even more indicative that she would not want a cutout.", "\"Treated as OP did?\" What did she do? She was just honest with the guy, apparently that's a crime now", "Lol what? That just sounds wasteful. Gifting is about getting a person you love something that makes them happy because you love them enough to know what they like and don\u2019t like, not about the gifter\u2019s ego. It is possible to both be grateful for the intention but honest about practicality. Love is being comfortable enough to not have to lie about loving a gift and having the gifter waste their money on something that will never be used.", "Christmas gifts are typically done without previous mutual contract. Same with birthday gifts.\n\nThat is completely normal.", "i\u2019m sorry you haven\u2019t met the right person", "\ud83e\udd28 No, I said she said she didn't like one present (she told him she thought it was creepy). \n\nNor did I say she complained to him.  I said she complained about them in front of them (which is obvious, since she said he could see her messages to her friend with her criticism).\n\nPerhaps before throwing insults about my comprehension, perhaps you might want to read my comment and her post a little more closely.", "Bruh.", "Just because you like a character does not mean you automatically appreciate a life size cut out of them. Like it\u2019s not a good gift either way unless it\u2019s been explicitly mentioned as something they would want, or if it\u2019s given as a gag gift.", "He could've ask.", "why would he ever think a life size cut-out was appropriate though? regardless if she is a fan or not that is a really weird & specific thing. not a figure? not a t-shirt? a life size cut-out?!? what is she meant to do with that??", "There were several others, I have a few tapestries and a lot of posters of SAO", "She said the poster was behind a door, though. It's not like it was proudly displayed front and center.", "She's absurd and soon to be alone.", "I didn\u2019t realize he was reading her texts. No one should be reading anyone\u2019s texts even if they\u2019ve been together 30 years. Sounds like they both need therapy. If she\u2019s this \u201churt\u201d and goes this insane over gifts and he\u2019s snooping on her, they should do themselves a favor, break up and get help.", "Lol! It's already creepy af!", "Exactly. Also, it\u2019s a gift, you can like it or not but to be \u201cdevastated\u201d and to then go on to badmouth your partner to others. There has to be other things going on with OP. Getting this angry and upset over gifts is just weird.", "Besides the fact that she said \"in my old apartment\" which was easy to surmise that she no longer had it or she would have implied current ownership,  I was able to verify that she not only no longer owned it, but tore it down in front of him by looking at her comments...", "She says she did communicate about things she liked.  Yes you do have to guess, but these are things that are objectively not great guesses and you can always ask.", "Once you leave high school we can talk about this again :)", "The point isn\u2019t that they hadn\u2019t talked about the GIFT before. OP says they\u2018ve never discussed Hatsune Miku before AT ALL. \n\nI\u2019d never assume someone is a fan of something because they own a single merchandise article, especially a poster since it\u2018s inexpensive (or free) and often up for years where an interest might\u2019ve already died down. I myself own a hand down band shirt from a band I\u2019ve never heard of before (but it\u2018s super cozy and barely recognizable), and would feel very awkward receiving a CD of them because someone saw me wear it once.\n\nI think it\u2018s pretty normal and honestly expended to discreetly check if they are interested in something before getting them merchandise from a fandom / game / artist / franchise, if that thing has never once been mentioned in a conversation, even though they apparently have had conversations about anime characters OP enjoys, where that could\u2018ve easily been brought up.", "I have never once in my life done a Christmas gift without some kind of previous contact. the only type of Christmas or birthday gift you should be giving without ever having some kind of discussion of what the person may or may not like/want, is secret santa", "Yet she did thank him, and by reading what you said it\u2019s arguable to say you\u2019re implying she\u2019s complaining by her not liking and complaining about it \u201cin his presence\u201d. \n\nAlso who can blame her for finding it creepy? I\u2019d  be scared of cut outs too. \n\nHe\u2019s overreacting. She tried protecting his feelings by not telling him and tried to get a different perspective from a friend, and he is being immature by giving her the silent treatment for not liking a gift. It\u2019s understandable to be upset and hurt, but that reaction? Especially when he did know she found it creepy already, which again who can blame her? I\u2019d even be scared thinking it\u2019d morph into a demon. \n\nMy point still stands.", "Sounds like a bad husband if he can't actually buy shit his wife likes.", "\n> But he really put a lot of love, effort and money into buying gifts. \n\nyour dad never managed to get your mom anything she actually liked? that doesn't speak well to how well he actually knew your mother, or how much time and love he actually put into getting her gifts. even a terrible gift giver should be able to find you something you actually like at least once. giving a gift shouldn't be about you. it's about the person you're giving it to, and I'm sorry if having a list feels to impersonal to you, but if that's what it takes for you to actually get your partner something they like, then you suck it up and ask for a list.", "A life size cut off of anything is out of the ordinary for gifts. That's common sense. \n\nI used to be really into Tom Hiddleston, I had a Pinterest board and tumblr for him and all, I couldn't shut up about him. I definitely did not want a life-size figure of him.", "No 100% the life sized cut out is a weird af choice even if he knew 100% that she loved the character", "Unrelated, but my family has a life-size cardboard cutout of Obi-Wan Kenobi we dress up and hide around the house for kicks.", "I'd find it hilarious if someone got me a life sized cut put of just about any character... I'd make a game out of it and start moving it around the house, putting weird clothes on it etc.", "I bet it's way more lighthearted than that. He just saw it somewhere and thought \"omg this would be hilarious, a life size cutout of the thing she's a fan of!\"   \n  \nAnd then instead of going \"omg haha this is hilarious\" op went \"ew I don't even like character\" and is acting all offended about such an innocent situation", "ah ok. happy cake day:D", "Sure. Did I say he did the best job? No. Did I say they apparently both sucked somewhat at communicating? Yes. Still no reason to bitch this much about BOTH gifts. She is being unreasonably critical about the make-up. Just because she likes some colors doesn't mean noone can gift her a different color palette unless she specifically stated she will never wear or mix these colors. And if you want specific brands THAT'S something you definitely need to communicate. The comment said she ta\u00f6ked about random things she likes. It doesn't say how cleat she made important things like brands and colors.", "I'm 34, you're wrong :) no one is forced to appreciate a damn thing.", "I mentioned in another comment he could have simply asked her about the character poster, as easy as \u201coh who\u2019s that character you have a poster hanging up of?\u201d At which point she could have clarified it wasn\u2019t hers. With the makeup palette he should have bought it knowing there\u2019s a chance she might not like it especially since makeup is a very personal thing and she mentioned she\u2019s not even into makeup like that, if she doesn\u2019t like it it\u2019s not a big deal to exchange it for something else.", "There's a different impact in saying \"I'm leaving the cut out here, it's creepy.  Thanks though.\" From her post, that was how I envisioned her reaction.  As opposed to, \"Wow thanks, I can't believe you remembered that poster.  That's so thoughtful.  But funny enough, that was left by my ex, and I don't actually like this character.  Also, I'm worried the cut out will scare me...., etc.\"\n\nAlso, I don't know enough to judge  him for the \"silent treatment.\" If that's truly what it is, I agree, then that's the exact opposite of proper, honest, and constructive communication.  But she hasn't added any context to judge it.  Has it been for an hour, six hours, 2 days?  Does he simply want some time to think on her comments/critiques?  Does he want a bit to make sure the argument won't escalate further? Who knows, because she provided no context, nor was she asking for a judgement on that.\n\nShe was asking if she was the AH for not liking the presents, and as I and others have pointed out, his thought process was reasonable and she shouldn't be upset with the presents.", "Yeah, but did she communicate that, or did she just say it's creepy? \ud83e\udd37 Because originally in her post she said she told her BF was leaving it at her parents because it's creepy, not everything else.", "My family had a life size cutout of my brother that he had made when he couldn\u2019t make it to his best friends wedding during covid, which we whip out and pose in family photos when he can\u2019t attend the celebration.", "Maybe because she doesn't even like the character...\n\nEven if the boyfriend thought it was a funny joke. A present is supposed to be for the other person, so you should buy them something that you think they'll like. Not something you think it's funny. She doesn't have to pretend to find it funny if that's just not her humour.\n\nOP gave her boyfriend numerous gift ideas for 3 months that he could have used instead. He just didn't listen. OP is understandably upset about her boyfriend not paying attention to what she actually likes.", "Adult with posters here, wall decor is wall decor. I don\u2019t like blank space", "I did not know that. I mean, obviously. Thank you!", "A life sized cut out is an unreasonable gift for anyone, even if they really do love the character, unless it\u2019s a gag gift based on an inside joke, or something they specifically asked for. Otherwise it\u2019s beyond insane and not at all reasonable.", "Okay sure, that might make things slightly different, but what series of events is true is hard to tell. I only read the post as it currently is.", "How was he supposed to know she didn't like that character? She had a freaking poster on her wall! Seems he was paying quite close attention", "Having blank spaces is overrated. I want my walls covered in decor but sadly due to only being able to afford the house bills and a little extra, decorating is not on my top 10 list.

How she started off saying it was just a poster hanging in her room that was from her ex, then it was her ex was abusive, then it was her BF saw her rip the poster to shreds.  It just reads as someone who is trying to spin the narrative in her favor after people have called her out.  But that might not be a fair take.", "Having a poster doesn't mean much. The fact that she hasn't talked about liking HM for all the time they've known each other is more telling. Plus, even if she liked HM, wanting a life-size cartoon is unusual. I love Harry Potter, and if someone gifted me a life-size cartoon of Ron Weasley I would be like wtf. \n\nThe thing is that OP told him about a lot of different things she would like for Christmas. And either he didn't pay any attention to what she said, or he just ignored everything and went through this idea, even though he didn't have any guarantee she would like it. \n\nI could give the boyfriend the benefit of the doubt and say that maybe he thought for some reason that OP could like this thing and wanted to surprise her with an unexpected gift. But his reaction to OP not liking the gifts and the fact that he snooped on her phone are not good signs of his character, to be honest.", "A poster she didn\u2019t want to move, and she doesn\u2019t watch the show or have anything else with that character.
