Your Future MIL is trying to establish that she controls her children regardless of their ages.

(And if she's so concerned about a 32yo woman staying alone, how does she explain her solution that demands a 26yo woman stay alone?)\n\nYou need to talk to your Fianc\u00e9 - he needs to decide things for himself and not for his mother's convenience.

Don't compromise, because this *is* an indication of exactly how your lives together will be. This is not an emergency situation; it's a planned thing involving someone's career, & it's almost certainly going to come up again at some point in the future. There's no good reason why SIL can't stay with MIL & FIL during her husband's business trip, if she's absolutely incapable of staying on her own. There's no good reason why your fianc\u00e9 has to babysit his father if MIL goes to stay with SIL. Your fianc\u00e9 needs to take this very seriously & make it clear to his mother right now that she cannot plan his life for him this way. If he doesn't want to check her now, what do you think your married life will be like?", "NTA but you should be grateful to your MIL who has given you the great gift of seeing what your fianc\u00e9\u2019s true priorities are & where you stand with him vs where his mom stands.

If the answer to both of those questions is no, then why is his mother making decisions for everyone about their living arrangements without discussing it with everyone first? \n4.

His dad is only 61 yo, and unless he has debilitating physical issues, is very capable of living on his own. Your fianc\u00e9 needs to tell his parents no, period.

I would have laughed in her face - the audacity!\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 made a commitment to you by agreeing to get an apartment with you and signing that lease.  That commitment absolutely trumps any ridiculous living scheme his mommy has dreamed up for him.  The ONLY proper response to his mother should have been an unequivocal \u201cNo.  I am not doing that.\u201d\n\nThe fact that he told you to \u201cjust give in to avoid conflict\u201d is a huge red flag.  He is telling you that his mommy matters more to him than you do.  That his mommy and her wants will always take precedence over you and your wants.  That you will never be able to trust him or depend on him.  That he will never be your partner because he will be too busy spending the rest of your lives catering to his mother at your expense.

He needs to be the one to tell his family NO. He is a grown man and he is starting his own family with you, and they need to respect that. You need to be protected as much as his mother and sister do. There\u2019s no compromise here, he\u2019s not doing it, and that\u2019s it. No matter how much drama it starts in his family, he has to stand by your side here. They are being completely unreasonable. And I almost feel like mother is testing both of you, to see how far she can push the limits and how much of her bullshit  you two will take.\n\nI hate to say it but MIL\u2019s are notorious for doing this type of thing, depending how crazy yours is, will depend how far she will take it.  You will be angry, rightfully so, but she will be able to manipulate the situation in a way that it will start causing major problems in your relationship if it hasn\u2019t already. Be careful with her, always be respectful & act like her friend/family member. Keep her as close as possible so she doesn\u2019t turn on you. I\u2019m saying this because I went through something very similar and I handled it differently. When I started being extra nice and killing her with kindness, things got a lot better.

Because this seems very calculated on the mother's part. \n\nIf your fianc\u00e9 gives in to her ridiculous demands and doesn't move in with you in y'all's apartment, that y'all signed a lease on, then you need to rethink this relationship! This is a sign of the meddling that is to come from your future MIL! It will only get worse. This is a massive red flag\ud83d\udea9! Don't ignore it!\n\nEdited to add judgement: NTA\n\nI got a little fired up! My former MIL and SIL acted like this once, while I was just dating my then BF. They were pissed he stayed with me during a hurricane and not them. Well, that's how that works when you are an adult in a committed relationship! They wanted to stay where they were and not come with us. And he wasn't going to leave me!", "NTA. This is a neon sign of things to come.  \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Sounds like your engaged to a mommas boy. You'll always lose to mom. No matter what. That'd what your future with him will look like. Watch those 3 months turn into 4, than 5 etc...", "NTA. Your fiancee is 28 years old he needs to tell her he is moving to his new home with you. If he doesn't, get out of the lease now because he will never get away from mommy.", "I'd look in my lease if I were you to see if there is a way to cancel it. If your fiance can't get out from his mother's influence to move in with you, he's not ready to be married or even thinking about living with you.\n\nEither that or he wants you to do all the moving in and is using these things as an excuse so he doesn't have to help organize the apartment.\n\nEither way NTA", "What 28 year old wants to live with his parents when there is a brand new apartment ready to move in with his girlfriend? Dear OP, going forward know that you are always going to come second. He will always give in to his parents to take the easy way. \n\nEdit: NTA", "Your mother-in-law doesn't want y'all living together. In 3 months something else will come up.", "NTA, but honestly, you do need to live alone for a while. Not to accommodate this situation, but to learn your boundaries and become strong and independent.\n\nThen you will not doubt yourself in the future, but see and know how ridiculous it is that your partner prioritizes anyone's needs above that if his new family.\n\nYou're inexperienced at this moment. Well, you won't be after you've fended for yourself a while.", "I\u2019ll do ya one even better.\n\nWhy are these adults incapable of living alone/letting someone live alone for three months?\n\nDoes future MIL really think fianc\u00e9\u2019s sis needs her there? If fianc\u00e9\u2019s sis can\u2019t be alone for three months, that\u2019s her problem and she can sort that out by going to parents\u2019 house instead of inconveniencing people, like you mentioned. But if she really can\u2019t fathom living alone without her husband for three months, then she might have bigger codependence problems.\n\nDoes future FIL really need fianc\u00e9 to be there?? Again, is this adult man incapable of living by himself for three months? Sure, maybe if he\u2019s elderly he needs some assistance, but that\u2019s not automatically fianc\u00e9\u2019s responsibility, it\u2019s future MIL\u2019s. And if future FIL is incapable of taking care of himself, then MIL should just take him with her to fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister\u2019s house, again, if sister is so adamant on staying in her own house.\n\nThis whole situation sounds just weird tbh. The logic just isn\u2019t there. It\u2019s really hard to believe that these adults couldn\u2019t find a better solution. Fianc\u00e9\u2019s sis isn\u2019t always gonna have mommy to come and take care of her in her husband\u2019s absence, part of being an adult is knowing how to take care of yourself (obviously unless there is some sort of disability or chronic condition involved that prevents someone from doing so. Even in that scenario, that burden should never fall on one person 24/7).", "Well then his mum shouldn't be moving out.", "People who fold to avoid conflict are oxygen theives.\n\nThis guy needs to grow up he's not an adult yet. This is not who you want to start off your independence with because he's not independent and you will always have his mommy influencing your life at every turn...\n\nYou seem excited and looking forward to your independence I'd bet good money he does not share this mentality. \n\nThis person will only hurt and hinder your growth into an independent adult. You need to find someone who actually has a spine and is enthusiastic about being independent and being their own person.", "Aint three weeks that this is expected to go on, which to reiterate: It most definitely should not, its three MONTHS that MIL, FIL, SIL, and Fiance are supposed to be in this absolutely stupid arrangement. Doesnt change one bit that everything you said is still very valid.", "Sorry bout that, definitely read wrong. I\u2019ll edit my comment but my point still stands lol", "Grown ass man being told where he has to live by his mommy. Good catch.\n\nIf he had a spine he could use the word NO.\n\nBut hey if you like your \"men\" neutered who are we to judge.\n\nAs an adult the idea that my mother would tell me what to do or have any say in where I live is cringy.", "Stand your ground. THIS IS YOUR HILL TO DIE ON!!!! If your future husband can not go against mommy now, he never will. He is in his 20s, a grown a$$ man!!! He does not need permission to move out into his own home!!!! Should you allow this, you are telling him that you will be ok with this sort of bull crap for the rest of your life. This should be a deal breaker!!!!! \n\nYou have several people from all over the world on here telling you this is not ok and not normal and that you deserve better. Please listen to everyone. It would be a shame to see you back on here in a year after you are married writing \"AITA for telling my husband not to come home until he stands up to his mother because I have been living alone for the past year of my 1 year marriage?\". This is your opportunity now to put a stop to it. \n\nYou should not be demanding an explanation why he is going to make you live by yourself for 3 months, there is no good answer in this case, unless your future father in law is bed bound and needs 24 hr care, and your future sisiter in law is unable to be left alone also.YOU SHOULD BE DEMANDING THAT HE MAKES YOU A PRIORITY NOW. \n\nSounds to me like future mother in law is trying to control your partner because 1. She doesn't like you. 2. She is trying to break you up. 3. She has some really weird and unhealthy relationship with your partner. 4. A combination of all of the above. \n\nMy judgment IS ESH. Your future in laws because they are manipulative and controlling. Your future husband because he has no spine and allows this sort of behavior. And you, because you should not be looking for the explanation, you should be demanding that your partner move in with you as planned. I'm the type of person who thinks people get more out of a relationship by treating their partner how they want to be treated. Demanding something is not in my nature. However,  if I were in your shoes, my future husband would have a serious decision to make, and there would only be 1 correct answer for this decision if he wanted to continue the relationship with me. Don't be naive about this. Your actions now will set the tone for the entirety of your marriage/relationship.", "No harm, no foul.\n\nAs noted, everything to do with this is stupid. Doesnt matter if it goes on for three weeks or three months.", "NTA and seriously put a hold on the marriage until you guys get some counseling. He is putting his mother and sisters feelings above yours. This is wrong. It sounds like you are marrying a people pleaser and it will be a constant battle to get your fianc\u00e9 to put you first if he doesn\u2019t change now.", "Nta. Why should a grown woman need parents to stay with her, why does a grown man(fil) need someone to live with him? Why can\u2019t he as a grown person himself, decide that doesn\u2019t work for me, and finish what you started? Seems like he\u2019s a mamas boy to the extreme and stand your ground now, it\u2019ll never get better.", " NTA fianc\u00e9 needs a spine. Why have they decided you can live alone so FIL doesn\u2019t have to? Why is fianc\u00e9 agreeing? And this is the time to start setting boundaries.

I would reconsider your entire relationship. This doesn\u2019t sound like the start of something good. You are right, if you give in, you will always be expected to.", "NTA- In what universe is it up to her? If your fiance says no, what in the world could his mum do about it other than sulk? Is she trying to change his mind about moving in with you?", "You got engaged not only before living with your partner, but before living outside of your parent's house? That is brave.\n\nNTA though his mom is being weird.", "NTA. He'll be setting a precedent if he allows himself to be voluntold what he's going to be doing. It's one thing for MIL to ask, quite another to just inform someone they will do it.", "Tell your fianc\u00e9 that NO is a complete sentence and as an adult he can actually say it to his mommy.

You're right not to give in on this. If your bf does, then reconsider your life with him. NTA", "What in the world? Is she a baby? In a gated community? Are you supposed to set up the apartment by yourself? This is just the beginning of your lives together and your SO wants you to give in to avoid conflict? How many more conflicts will you have to avoid by giving in in the future? Why isn't the mil comfortable with letting her husband babysit a grown woman? You give in now and that's it. You will be giving in forever. Your so needs to grow a spine. Who does this?", "This is just bullshit. I agree if you give into this pathetic shit a precedent will be set.

Hope your fiance chooses you", "NTA\n\nThis isn't your fight though, it is your fiance's.\n\nHe needs to be the one to step up and say 'no'. From what you have said, what is being suggested is not a logical solution - because one relative is lonely through the choices they have made, his mother had to solve that problem, which leaves his father with exactly the same problem, and getting your fiance involved just causes exactly the same problems again for you. There would need to be a very good reason for you to accept that inconvenience over letting them just deal with it themselves or finding another solution (why doesn't mum and dad both stay with the sister in law, or the sister in law just stay with them?).\n\nThe only excuse I could see would be where there are extenuating circumstances - poor health needing monitored, children and work to be balanced or so on, but even then it isn't your issue to deal with.", "Why do your SIL and FIL need to be babysat? \ud83e\udd14 NTA", "NTA, but put the brakes on this engagement.
