Use your words. Don\u2019t cause potential damage to instruments possibly even loaned out by the school that there may not be money to repair or replace. \n\nSure, they shouldn\u2019t have parked across your driveway, and it\u2019s actually a big pet peeve of mine. But because your response was so ridiculous, you lost all high ground.", "Lol, I\u2019ll always chuckle at a sprinkler story, but next time just verbally ask them to move dude. YTA.", "First and foremost: Bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!\n\nSecondly: Even with the edit, YTA. Sure, you asked them to move once. They didn't move. I think most normal people would then maybe go and talk to a couple more adults and explain \"Hey, I need to get out of my driveway and you blocked the whole dang thing.\" Or you could have been a little bit unhinged and started yelling madly and *threatening* to turn the sprinklers on. But instead you went straight to DOUSING THE CHILDREN IN WATER. Nice one.\n\nYou punished the kids for dumb adults communicating poorly. Very much so YTA. But I'm also sort of here for it haha.", "Obviously,  you're only option was to stare at them for 20 minutes then purposefully turn on your sprinklers to hit them when your telepathic messages to move didn't get through (I bet those band uniforms blocked them). What did your brother expect you to do - talk to them and ask them to move? YTA\n\nEdit: the majority of the comments are telling you that you should have said something and suddenly you remembered your sister had asked them to move.", "YTA. \n\nWhat did you think the band kids were there for? All you had to do was walk outside and ask them to move the van. Instead you got them wet and could have damaged their instruments.", "Yes, YTA.  What the heck is the matter with you?  This is a problem in your life that you had to solve?  And you couldn't come up with a more productive way to solve it?  Sheesh.  I'm guessing because you live with your brother and sister that perhaps you're still a child.  I hope that's the case.  This certainly wouldn't be the way a grown man should behave.", "YTA and you know it. I also don't believe the added explanation actually happened. I don't believe that any conversation actually happened. You could clearly see that they were there for a purpose. It's not like a whole band pulls into your driveway every day.", "Yes YTA; as a former band kid those instruments can sometimes cost thousands. If the instrument is made of genuine wood water can ruin it. You should have just gone outside and asked them to move. \n\nEdit: I like how in your reasoning you may be the asshole you put \"inconvenienced them.\" It's like the idea of asking them to move literally never occurred to you", "**YTA** \\- But band instruments sometimes get caught in the rain.  No harm done to the instruments.", "So you just remembered that you used your words first, you just chose to let that part out. Weird choice because it's pretty much the most important part of the story. \n\nLeaving that out means you either lied about it in the edit, or you lied about the whole story and don't like the resounding y t a that you're getting from everyone. \n\nYta\n\nYou either lied about using your words first, or the whole story, both are ah moves.", "YTA\n\nMusical instruments can be very expensive.  And many types of musical instruments can be badly damaged by water.\n\nPlus, some of those instruments may be owned by the school, and passed on to new students in the band every year (With proper cleaning, of course.)  If you damaged those instruments, you may have done serious damage to school property, and the school's budget is not going to stretch to replace multiple instruments quickly. \n\nOr, if the instruments belong to the students, you're talking about a major expense for the parents or guardians  as investment in a child's education.\n\nPlus, if it is a marching band, and they have uniforms, that is another very significant expense for either the school or the parents.\n\nEither way, it's potentially thousands of dollars of damages.\n\nIt isn't that hard to go out and tell the chaperones \"please move your van, you're blocking my driveway,\" if you need to go out.\n\nBut it doesn't seem that you were trying to go out. So they neither harmed nor inconvenienced you.   You were just annoyed.  You decided to risk causing expensive damages for no reason at all. \n\nIf you own the home, do you have the right to do this?  Technically, yes. But it's an AH move to take this route of action without trying \"ask nicely\" first, especially since this is something that happened once, not a routine problem.", "I need some more info;\n\n- Did you need to leave?\n- Did you talk to them?\n- Are you old?\n- Are you bitter?\n- Do you act a fool?\n- Do you kick toddlers?\n\nAre you the old grumpy man from Sesame street?", "I think YTA but to be clear as I mau have missed it -  could you have just, er, *asked *them to move?", "YTA. Are you a toddler? Do you not know how to use your words and ask them to move?", "YTA\r  \n\r  \nYou should have just asked them to move.\r  \n\r  \nTurning on the sprinklers was passive aggressive and mean spirited. You owe them an apology at the very least, and if you damaged any of their instruments, money for repair or replacement as well.", "YTA - you could\u2019ve simply asked them to move you shouldn\u2019t have done all of that plus it can ruin their instruments.", "This is clearly not going to be popular, but **NTA**.\n\nParking in front of a driveway, okay, you tell them they need to move. This wasn't about the van, though.\n\nA bunch of people congregating in a private driveway as if it were their property? Without notice or even asking permission? Who does that?\n\nThey could have and should have come to Op's door and used their words to ask permission. They didn't. Op gave them plenty of time to act like responsible people.\n\nThey don't use their words, Op doesn't use words, either. The sprinklers were an appropriate indicator that next time don't just use private property without permission. Depending on the timing, this exact thing could have happened via automatic, timed sprinklers.", "YTA. Yeah it sucks that they parked in your driveway. But from what you\u2019ve told us, you weren\u2019t in need of the driveway at the time. Some of those instruments cost upwards of 5,000 dollars. You could have simply requested that they move out of your driveway, I\u2019m sure they would have.", "YTA - So was asking them to leave not an option?", "YTA do you do this to other people who stand in your driveway too?", "YTA - Actions speak louder than words, which you didn't even try to use.", "YTA. Only one person was driving that van, yet you spray them all with water? Anytime during those 20 mins you watched them, did it occur to you to speak to them and ask them to move?", "Jesus that edit. Fix your shit and take responsibility for your own fucking actions.", "NTA.  I don't understand why people are so upset about the possibility of ruining the kids' instruments.  \n\n> My parents were big on personal responsibility.\n\nThey parked there, following up with loitering.  \n\n----\n\nNot every student owns their instrument.  Some are on loan to the student from the school while others rent them.  Instruments always have insurance because accidents happen.
