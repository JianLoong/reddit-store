I totally understand not wanting a party, and definitely not a surprise party.  You told your BF that you didn't want one and he totally disregarded your wishes.  He not only owes the people who invited an apology but you as well.", "NTA.  You were clear and he ignores you.  That isnt ok.", "NTA. Your bf is the AH. I prefer a quiet day on my birthday as well. He didn't respect you and made your day worse. I'm tired of extroverted people trying to force introverted people to be more outgoing.", "NTA. He disrespected your clearly laid out preferences for your own birthday.", "NTA. \n\nYou don\u2019t like surprise parties. You\u2019ve repeatedly told him this. He chose not to listen to you.

You specifically told him what *not* to do, and he went ahead and did it anyway.

He did exactly what you told him not to do.  My initial thought was that you could have been a little more gracious with your guests and waited til after the party to let loose on him.  But,  if you had done that he would have decided that you really did like the party because you were being polite, regardless of what you said to him afterwards.  I have to say that people rarely develop listening skills once they are adults.  So don\u2019t expect him to change.", "NTA. You said what you wanted and he ignored you. Also don't your parents and at least some of your friends know you wouldn't like a party? Somebody should have told him, or warned you.", "NTA at all! Given the day you had and what you had planned for the evening vs what you got, your reaction is justified. \n\nI hope you have a better evening <3 \n\nALSO like why did he plan this right after work?! Who wants to celebrate with 30 people drinking and mingling in scrubs?! That alone tells me he was only thinking of himself.", "NTA. Even if you had not had a bad day he completely disrespected your wishes. \n>\nHe put you in a terrible position. Either you had to put on a very fake smile and be miserable on the inside. Or do what you did and not participate in the party making you look like an ungrateful party pooper. \n>\nIt was an unfair lose-lose situation for you which is the OPPOSITE of how you should feel on your birthday. He set you up for failure.", "NTA. You expressed yourself and your desire for no event, no party. He acknowledged you and then did the exact opposite because I'll be his thinking was \"everybody likes surprises\" \ud83d\ude44\n\nYou rightfully did not just go with the flow and endure it, you were honest and stuck to your feelings. Which is honestly far too rare, and good for you. We all tolerate far too much BS in our lives because of expectations. We shouldn't.", "NTA. i\u2019ve told my bf this as well. i would be too anxious to have fun in this situation. surprises aren\u2019t for everyone and he should acknowledge that. he probably wanted to make himself feel good by planning this.", "NTA; you stated CLEARLY that you didn\u2019t want a surprise party. \n\nKinda sucks for the guests who came tho, and it\u2019s on your bf to apologize both to them and you", "NTA. You were very clear about what you wanted, and he chose to ignore that and put his wants over yours. I am surprised that your parents went along with it - surely they know you would hate that kind of thing?\n\nYes, you probably could have reacted better, but I understand why you didn't. And really, women are still too often expected to be people pleasers and tolerate other people's bulllshit at the expense of their own comfort.", "NTA. No means no", "NTA \n\nMy mother will never throw me a surprise party again!\n\nSometimes they just don\u2019t work", "NTA You made your feelings clear, he didn\u2019t listen", "NTA.

He trampled all over them", "I'm on the fence between NTA and ESH. Your boyfriend was definitely an asshole for ignoring your wishes and your boundaries, and putting you in such an uncomfortable position. However, your reaction could be seen as a slap in the face to the people who came to celebrate you in good faith.\n\nYou know what? On second thought I'm going with NTA. Your meltdown was genuine and understandable and totally avoidable but for your boyfriend's assholery.", "NTA. \n\nWithout question, he should have respected your wishes and not put together a surprise birthday. Obviously, I don't think this came from a place of ill will. A surprise party is supposed to be a surprise. I'm sure that he deeply regrets it.\n\nAs for the surprise party itself and your entrance.. You are an adult capable of self-control. I understand that you had a bad day but your lack of respect for the 30 somewhat people in your living room is pretty embarrassing for everyone involved. If you haven't already, I would reach out to everyone that came and explain that you had a terrible day and never wanted or wished for a surprise birthday and thank them for coming.", "NTA \n\nYou could have handled it a little better, but considering the type of bad day you can have as a medical resident I am inclined to cut you some slack on it.", "Veri light ESH.\n\nYour boyfriend should not have done that, but at the same time, even though your are not oblighed to, you should have said hi or something or even just acknoledge the people who sacraficed time from their day the wish you the best.

They're super disorienting for the 'recipient'. Suck for everyone if the recipient isn't in a party mood. \n\nSure you might have handled it a little better but definitely NTA.", "NTA.  You clearly told him no, he didn't respect you enough to listen to you and organised one anyway.  I probably would have just walked back out the door and checked myself into a nice hotel for the night.", "NTA", "NTA. If you hadn\u2019t had a conversation where you said - point blank - that you didn\u2019t want one and the reasons for it, then I\u2019d chalk it up to a misunderstanding.  You gave him legitimate reasons for not wanting one. He should have respected that. He didn\u2019t throw you a surprise party for you. He did it for himself. Then pouted because you didn\u2019t react the way he *wanted* you to.  \n\nIf you knew he hated lobster. Like repulsed by it.  It makes him sick to his stomach just to look at one.  But on his birthday, since it\u2019s a special occasion, you went and bought the best lobsters you could find. I mean, if it was your birthday, you would definitely want some lobster.  So he\u2019s at his stressful job all day, and can\u2019t wait to relax at home with you. All while you slave away in the kitchen preparing this amazing lobster. You plate it all up, it looks like Martha Stewart herself set your table.  You even FaceTime his friends and family so they can see his reaction to your amazing spread. He walks in the door and takes one look at the lobster.  \n\nBy his reasoning, he should graciously sit down, tell you how amazing it looks, and thank you repeatedly for working so hard to do this awfully nice thing for him. ON HIS BIRTHDAY. Then he should continue and eat the whole. Damn. Lobster. With a smile on his face. While telling all of the people you\u2019ve FaceTimed how much he enjoys lobster and it\u2019s the best meal he\u2019s ever had. \n\nSounds kinda stupid right? Something tells me he wouldn\u2019t eat the damn lobster.", "NATO\n\nHe FAFO.", "Thank you thank you.  \n\nAnd yeah, I've just been sitting with my head down on my desk wishing that I hadn't wasted those lobster tails.", "I suspect he probably told them that I was okay with it, that's the only explanation I can come up with.", "If the guests felt embarrassed, uncomfortable or slighted in any way that's on the BF. He misrepresented the situation and invited them knowing full well OP didn't want a party. He can explain to everyone why OP stormed out.", "I disagree. Yes a surprise party is supposed to be a surprise but that means keeping the plans a secret, it's not a pass to throw a party for someone who *explicitly* said that they don't want one because it makes them uncomfortable. \nThere is no generous way to view the boyfriend's behaviour. He either decided he knew better than OP and believed she would enjoy a party despite saying otherwise, or he didn't care about her wishes/comfort and wanted to satisfy his own ego in front of their family and friends.\n\nThe only person who should be apologising to the guests is the boyfriend. This is his fault, he can fix it.", "Why should she?\n\n  \nWhy does she have to cater and think about others, when she was not expecting anything of them to be in her home. She had a shitty day and just wanted to spend the night in with her partner.   \n\n\nThe only person who is at fault and that sucks here is the egotistical bf.", "Counterpoint: BF having created this situation entirely through his own inconsiderate behavior, *all* the responsibility for explaining to the guests should fall on him.  Period.", "So he double-lied, once to you and then over and over again to everyone who attended, so he could throw a party for himself with your birthday as the excuse.\n\n\nHe sounds childish, immature and selfish. Hope his other qualities balance him out enough to justify putting up with him. NTA.", "Fair points.\n\nBut I'll point out that this is assuming the absolute worst of him and the situation.\n\nAs for the apologizing / fixing... I agree with you that he should be apologizing. However, I entirely disagree that she could have been an adult for a half an hour for the sake of THIRTY other people. It's not their fault.", "Assuming the worst? I really don't understand how his behaviour could be defended. \n\nOP had at least one direct conversation with him about not wanting a birthday party, including explaining exactly why she doesn't. The most generous take I can think of is that he forgot this discussion when thinking of what to do for her birthday. In that case it wouldn't be malicious but still his fault and he bears the responsibility of setting things right with the guests. \nOtherwise he knowingly ignored/disregarded her wishes because he wanted to throw a party.", "He decided he knew better than you about how you feel about having a party.

But I love you, obviously. Sorry you got caught in the crossfire.\".", "NTA. Why do so many people think that when you say No Birthday Party, it's a secret code that means, SURPRISE PARTY. I would have taken my food, walked right out the door and went to the park and had a private picnic.", "NTA you told him and he totally ignored you. He owes every one an apology", "NTA.", "NTA. You probably could have reacted better, and maybe been polite to your guests. But the boyfriend is definitely TA. \n\nI totally get it tough. (I eloped and my sister wanted to throw us a huge party - I couldn't handle it, and she very nicely agreed to no party)", "Idk NTA but you could have been kinder. A lot of people tend to ignore their SO\u2019s love language. I really like being treated and taken out but as my fianc\u00e9 has grown in his cooking journey his love language has become cooking dinner for me. Sometimes it\u2019s frustrating for me because I would like something fast and NOW while he\u2019s settling into the kitchen for however long cooking will take. \n  With you, you either have some kind of trauma where you won\u2019t allow others to come spend time with you over celebrating a very big gift-living- OR you are such an introvert that lots of people over is suffocating and or exhausting to the point of hiding for the next few days. \n  My guess is your boyfriend enjoys people around. Extroverts usually don\u2019t understand introverts and can take some people years before they understand the other side. \n  It\u2019s also worth mentioning that a lot of women tend to say \u201coh don\u2019t do anything I\u2019m fine.\u201d But secretly want a fuss and therefore men will make a fuss because media has shown time and again women becoming angry over no such fuss and the man paying for it. \n  So it\u2019s time to have a heart to heart with him. If you want to apologize make sure to put value on his efforts. But then. Did you experience anxiety over everyone shouting at you?? You need to tell him. Do you fear/hate aging? You need to tell him that too. Did you have terrible birthdays growing up? Do you feel like you can\u2019t eat or enjoy anything with lots of people around?? \n  My guess is there has to be more to unpack with you. Also him. It\u2019s quite possible he\u2019s being a real pick me boy and that\u2019s why he hasn\u2019t put value on any of your requests.", "\"wishing that I hadn't wasted those lobster tails.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwhen you really should wish you hadn't wasted your life on your AH bf.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo get yourself some new lobster tails, and a new boyfriend.", "Giving people exactly what they don\u2019t want, and then expecting them to be grateful.

It is miserable being with someone who will not hear your voice and consider your wishes in what is supposed to be a partnership.
