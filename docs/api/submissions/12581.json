It appears that this was an oversight, as only one pair was dirty. It sounds like you got them for free. Why couldn\u2019t you just rewash the clothes and leave it alone? Maybe because I am a nurse so bodily fluids don\u2019t phase me much, but you could have been a lot more tactful when mentioning it. And poop is easily washed, people here acting like it\u2019s some radioactive material vs. something you wipe off your own butt daily.", "NTA\n\nWell, a little bit the AH for making me dry retch.", "Need more info.

Relayed why, and left out the shit pants out of embarrassment (like you said). It\u2019s AH of her, I\u2019d say lightly if she\u2019s genuinely a good person otherwise and this is how it got out. I\u2019d still say AH because she\u2019s now letting colleagues think worse of you - she could\u2019ve just not said much or tell the whole truth and own it.\n\nIf she\u2019s just going around making this gossip unprompted. I wouldn\u2019t even bother having feelings over it. You did the right thing correcting the people who bring it up to you. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t start gossiping like her - make sure you don\u2019t cause then it\u2019s e s h. \n\nGood luck! That\u2019s super gross and unhygienic. Clearly she didn\u2019t check or something idk", "YTA. You were rude and didn't have to react that way. All you had to do was politely tell her that the wet pants were in there and ask if she accidently put them in there. You didn't need to lecture her. I'm sure she felt like shit. I have no idea how the pants got in there because like you said, I would imagine you would have noticed, but they did.", "I would be TA and walk right up to her desk and ask her in a very loud voice if her washing machine might need servicing because it's just not right that she said she laundered them, and the machine didn't work. /s As for OP, NTA.

You said it yourself in the title that she collected those. It could be possible she asked people to launder before delivering, and she just moved them by the pile to the box/bag.\n\nYou didn\u2019t notice the stained pants until you were sifting through the clothes, it\u2019s possible she overlooked it as well while she was compiling them.\n\nRegardless. Ungrateful, and yes YTA.\n\nThat being said, she\u2019s also an AH for spreading false words about what happened. But for the dirty pants? That could have been an honest mistake.", "NTA - Personally I would have just silently judged to avoid a situation like this\u2026 but thats a very valid complaint.

I'd have instantly bagged it all up and thrown it in the trash.", "I'm going to be a minority here, but I'm going with soft YTA. It was clearly a mistake, seeing how every single garment wasn't filthy. People make mistakes. Be it used clothes or brand new clothes, you should ALWAYS wash them before wearing them. \n\nIf you absolutely had to, you could have mentioned the pooped pants and laughed it off. She was clearly apologetic and I imagine embarrassed, but you didn't have to tell her it was disgusting and to check clothing before handing it to someone.

Hugely unpleasant to deal with YES, especially if it's from outside your family and was unexpected, but chuck in the washing machine on a hot wash and it's good to go. The recipient toddler would no doubt have shat their own clothes at some stage and reworn items post-wash without a problem. Or perhaps they have worn hand me downs from big siblings who at one stage have vomited or shat or bled over the item of clothing. It's not a \"major health concern\". \nNot to diminish OPs experience, which I absolutely agree was disgusting and inappropriate, but poo from another (presumably) toddler isn't of itself a health hazard, it's not the end of the world.\n(Authority: mum of toilet training children)", "Giving away this level of disgusting isn\u2019t uncommon ask any charity shop about the bad donations every single one will have 10/20+ stories of how people don\u2019t care what they donate, people treat poorer people like less and they should be grateful for someone giving away sick stained or soiled clothes.

What her coworker did, accusing OP of being ungrateful for used clothes, is completely unacceptable and should've been kept to herself and not gossiped about because she was aware of the issue OP took offense to with the black pants, not the rest of the clothing.

You really got me!", "I do agree with you on the point that the toddler most probably would have shat those pants at some point themselves. My concern is that if it IS diarrhoea there could have been harmful bacteria that could have spread to the other items of clothing (which could have been put on if OP didn't check them all at first) and made the child sick. Also If the clothes have already been put together for some time with that moist environment it could have lead to an infection with fungi (such as penicillium an botrytis) which can cause long-term issues with the pulmonary tract such as asthma if exposed to at a young age. (source: I studied biolgy and took a module on mold fungi).\n\nI have no beef with \"freshly\" pooped items of cloting if you can retrace it to be just an incident of not making it to the toilet in time (which is absolutely understandable at that age and should not be made a big fuss about) that you just toss into the washer so they can be reworn, but those pants might have contaminated the whole batch of clothing. Also there is a good reason they don't allow kids into kindergarten if they have diarrhoae or have to puke.", "I highly doubt her own coworker meant to put the wet, gross pants in there.

Not that I agree with her gossiping then about the situation.", "Like I said, I have no idea how it got in there but I'm sure it was on accident.", "I'm with you with how the coworker reacted too about talking about her. I didn't even get into that. I still say she could have been polite about the situation.", "the smell alone would be a giveaway. like, she had to pick up, fold, and then place it in with the other clothes. either she has no sense of touch or smell or she was just too lazy to wash it herself before throwing it in thinking \u201cmaybe they won\u2019t notice\u201d", "They were folded??", "The only thing that comes to mind is that her child's dirty clothes were around when she was packing the box and she accidently grabbed the pants.

Its also possible someone else threw them in the wrong pile.", "The gossiping is the exact argument everyone who donates unwearable stuff to the charity shops use.

If you gave someone shitty underwear by accident would you not be too embarrassed and ashamed to even talk to your coworkers about it let alone complain about her being ungreatful?", "Or perhaps the coworker was trying to create a situation. Some people just like to watch things burn.", "Yes! Not even on the top of the pile where they could \"accidentally* put them there. They were nearly halfway down, folded in with the other pants.", "Maybe the coworker felt attacked (and I'm sure she was embarrassed) and didn't know how to handle the situation. She probably felt like she had to tell others before word got out from the OP. Both sides were wrong at the end of the day.", "I highly doubt that was it.", "That\u2019s not only gross, but it\u2019s also really weird! \n\nI\u2019m guessing she is bad mouthing you because she\u2019s embarrassed.  She must have thought you would blab to everyone about it, so she told people her own version first.", "I only ever talked to her about this in person, in private, and reacted how anyone who recieved shit soiled pants would.
