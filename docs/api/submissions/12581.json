She may have not known at all about the soiled jumper until you sniffed it out.", "NTA  You did nothing wrong, you just pointed out the nasty pants to your co-worker.  Perhaps the \"disgusting & completely unhygienic\" was a tiny bit much, even though 100% true.  And as long as you didn't say anything in front of the entire group so that everyone heard, she needed to know about it.  She's the one who went around telling others an edited story!  I'm guessing someone in her family messed their pants & hid them in the box without her knowing about them.", "At first I was going to say AH because you could just do what I do, say thanks and donate/ throw out what you don\u2019t want but this is just disgusting. Like why would she do that? How would she not know? Or smell?", "\ud83e\udd2e My first job was at Goodwill (charity if you're not from the USA) and people would donate used, unwashed *panties*. I can still remember the smell of those bags and it has been 24 years.", "Library clerk and I've seen a few gross items. I tell myself it's something mostly harmless like spilled Coca Cola else it would drive me nuts.", "I work in a pharmacy and the things people will sneak in when they return unused medicine are disgusting - false teeth, used adult incontinence pads, full catheter bags, loose used needles...", "My mom too, but she is to kind to complain, a couple of months ago my aunt moved out of town so she gave a couple of sport shoes, and mom yelled at me when I complained because they were really stinky and said I shouldn't complain about free stuff, I just responde that my aunt (someone really picky with the cleaning and order) should clean her shoes more often.", "That's awful. Sorry that happened to you. What I don't get is why don't they just throw it out?? It's even less trouble for them all they have to do is put it in a garbage bag and leave it out front on trash day. Why drive it all the way to the charity shop and ruin someone elses day", "I did a Boy Scout project that involved collecting children's books ... good thing I sorted them because there was something risque and also a religious tract in there ... not physically dirty but still not going to elementary schoolers", "This reminds me of when people donated expired food to food banks. Like what are you doing?", "I only did a few months voluntary work in a charity shop and I saw so much underwear, like what normal person thinks it\u2019s ok to donate thongs to a charity shop?\n\n\n^also^a^vibrator^like^wtf", "This is so common, I don't get it. \nThe goodwill in my area resells open cosmetic/hygiene items \ud83e\udd22 don't know how they are getting away with that", "Oh yeah, underwear galore, and the stains included \ud83e\udd22 Too many skidmarks to count.\n\nAlso, not just vibrators but porn mags too! Oh my god, porn mags and porn *books*. Books. Like. No. Nope. Not going out on the floor. Not going to see the *light of day* again, straight into the garbage.\n\nPSA Everyone: please throw out anything you have touched to your genitals or anything you have touched your genitals to. The thrift stores do not want it. No one wants it. \n\nOkay, someone out there might want it, but your local thrift store does not.", "Omg I can't believe how un thoughtful people can be, donated suff is not trash and it shouldn't be treat that way. And worst, how can someone do that to an animal?", "That does not makes this okay. Why would people in poorer countries want this either, especially due to the destruction of local markets and industries? Especially for stained things? This is such a not cool perspective.", "Bulging out is a sign of contamination but dented in sounds okay unless deep enough to break the seal or leaving the can not physically stable\n\nI'm not personally skittish about expiration dates but I understand if food banks legally have to be, not using it right away could keep the clock ticking, and some things are too far gone even for me.", "Don't people get mad too, when it's pointed out it can't be used for safety reasons. \nThey think people should be grateful for already opened boxes, or cracked plastic containers, canned soup that expired 5 years ago. Or cans with no label at all.", "I mean, open shampoo is still just shampoo.", "I don\u2019t know how it works in the us but here in the uk charity shops are often volunteered at by mostly older ladies (like 75-80+) so there\u2019s also you are donating your sex toys to somebody\u2019s grandma which is an interesting angle as well.", "You really have no perspective on actual poverty, do you?\n\nSome people are poor enough that they will actually repair or reuse things if it gets damaged. If you don\u2019t do that you might as well give it to someone who will", "I went to donate to a pantry last summer and they searched the box before they would accept it because of how many people try to give them outdated garbage. I don't get why people can't just throw it away.", "Not everyone does this shit!  I was shocked when one of my coworkers made a comment that I was the only person she knew who went to the grocery store to buy stuff to bring to the food pantry.  I was just like WTF? I think she was more than a little embarrassed that I gave her hell for cleaning out her pantry of expired foods and donating them.  People suck", "We are in Canada and I believe we do have small thrift stores manned by volunteers, but they get much less donations (atleast in my area) than our big chain thrift store found across Canada, where people are employed (my boyfriend was salaried as a manager!).\n\nBut the UK aspect is equal parts funny and horrifying, having someone's grandmother have to pick through that \ud83d\ude33", "I never said they wouldn't? That is actually why I specifically said especially for stained things versus damaged things. I still don't think it is a good idea to encourage the donation of materials or items in bad, poor, or damaged shape. It sets a horrible precedent, as someone who has regularly been on the receiving end of donated food that is expired and volunteered in shops where we have had to thrown out things because of concerns with hygiene. If folks want to donate, they should try the best they can to donate items folks can use. Rich people, or even middle class people, should not use donations as an excuse to get rid of items that cannot be used.", "Because they\u2019re just trying to be helpful! Obviously poor people should be grateful for the food they get. And of course if they\u2019re poor they should be okay with getting poisoned! /s", "The hygiene thing is different. It\u2019s disrespectful to not bother to clean your donations first. I already said people shouldn\u2019t donate dirty things.\n\nI think expired food is different. A lot of food that\u2019s expired is still safe to eat. Wealthier people might be too choosy to eat that themselves, but actual poor people who are so desperate they\u2019re rummaging through dumpsters looking for food that MIGHT be safe aren\u2019t going to be so choosy. If you won\u2019t eat that yourself, give it away.\n\nNot to food banks, though. Food banks are required to throw away expired food even if it\u2019s safe. But if you give it directly to a homeless person they might appreciate it.\n\nOf course that also requires them to actually interact with a homeless person and most wealthier people don\u2019t want to do that either.", "Expired food is not safe to eat. It might be sometimes, but in general it can make people sick and it is not fair or okay to put that on food banks or strangers. If you want to risk it in your own pantry, okay. Giving it away? No. And I'm not talking about things right past the due date or dumpster diving, which I have done, I am talking about clearly expired or food that has been expired beyond any time recently. And a lot of homeless people actually get really freaked out about food unless it is from organizations they trust, because people are assholes. I have friends who have poisoned. Who have found nails in their food. I'm not asking for designer clothes or food. I am asking for clean, safe, and helpful resources. We can do better than the bare minimum, which shouldn't even include a lot of what folks donate.", "NTA. This might be the petty in me, but I'd take pictures and videos of the non-usable clothes and explain why you cannot use them and send this massively to everyone in your department/anyone she has talked about this. And I'll also file a HR complaint for lying about you and knowingly making false claims about you so your co-workers see you in a bad light with no apparent reason. Let them investigate what else has she been doing. Work environment is supposed to be somewhere where you can lean on each other and she's dividing you all and aggressively bullying you. My mum and aunt always say: \"I left highschool too long ago to be dealing with this\". Be the bigger person, you never know who else is she doing that to and if they are afraid to speak up for themselves. You are not only fighting for you but for others to come.\nEDIT: I accidentally pressed send before finishing \ud83d\ude05 On my phone and it's difficult to write.", "NTA.", "NTA. Had she not told other coworkers lies you wouldn\u2019t have had to tell the truth. She embarrassed herself", "NTA", "NTA that's disgusting", "Maybe it accidentally got mixed in there and she was super embarrassed? I would be. \n\nBut nta.", "Husband\u2019s coworker gave him a big box of used toys for our toddler she\u2019d collected from a flea market. They were filthy and went straight in the garbage. We didn\u2019t say anything to her about it, though. I think she meant well\u2026", "Yta. Wow. I\u2019m sure she made a mistake. You real and embarrass someone for an accident. I really don\u2019t think she purposely put in that outfit. My daughter throws all her clean and dirty clothes on her floor and I have to literally sort through trying to figure out which ones are clean or dirty. Once I put a dirty dress back in her dresser and didn\u2019t realize until I put it on her stained and dirty. It happens.", "I used to work part time in a consignment shop for equestrian clothing. The things we found in the pockets of show coats were ridiculous", "Depending on the age, maybe a toddler that had an accident and tried to be helpful (putting the clothes with the stack of clothes, like laundry)?", "I love lamp", "We just don't know if those were lies or not! Sounds like a possible real interpretation of what the OP said to her.", "Everyone saying that the donor \"made up\" what the OP said is not realizing your point -- that if OP yelled at her, she may have truly had the impression that OP was unappreciative or whatever it is she said. (I mean, I too have the impression OP was unappreciative?) It's not the nicest to talk behind people's backs but it is not clear that she was intentionally misrepresenting what was said, and if OP screamed at her, which seems like a distinct possibility from info given, I kindof don't blame her for telling other coworkers.", "Your son sounds like the type of person who will brighten the world just by being in it!", "My daughter was horrible about this!  She would pee in her panties and then hide them. We found panties a decade later.", "My friend and I would hit thrift shops and 2nd hand stores on Saint Patrick's Day.  I remember her pulling some underwear out of a bin. The employee assured us that they only put out unused stuff. We were relieved. I'd never dream of donating used undergarments.  I've had a few new bras given to me, but I don't see them after I couldn't get them on, after a wash.", "Thank you, kind Redditor. I realize with a downvoted post like this that there\u2019s a very low chance that anybody\u2019s going to read it, but it\u2019s important to me that I fix it and your external validation is much appreciated. Thank you.", "This is so sad. I come from a small town, mostly working-class people. Whenever there was a sick kid or a family in crisis, somebody's cousin or friend would organize a BBQ plate fundraiser. They'd put signs up around town & that Saturday sell plates of food for $10-12. All the food was donated and cooked by friends/family, and all the $$ went directly to the family in need. It's one of my favorite things about my hometown, how people helped each other out the way they could, long before GoFundMe.", "The type of person who wants that kind of thing will pay you, let's just say that.", "I hope your kid is okay now.", "My best friend died of cancer. His **kids** (12f/14m) didn't come to say goodbye before he moved to his last hospice. No calls/texts, nothing. He was a complicated guy, had flaws, but he tried to do everything for them and lived out of his car at one point rather than move too far away to see them regularly.", "I can tell you they grow in the \"best friend\" who visits you once while you're hospitalized over and over with life threatening blood clots. And then sends an email accusing you of being a hypochondriac and saying everyone who knows you wishes you'd go away and leave them alone. And bcc's your two other closest friends.\n\nOh, and asks you to hold her hand through 2 voluntary abortions while you battle infertility and repeat miscarriages. \n\nAnd yeah, I've just outed myself to anyone that knows me, but folks, those are the adults you're raising when you don't teach empathy.\n\nETA: I'm not being judgemental about the abortions, she made the best choice and I was glad she could make it legally and safely. Even went through the reasons for it with her. Just that I was the wrong person to call.", "It's not nasty to tell someone to be respectful. Donate things in good condition. If they're repairable repair them yourself before you donate. It's about basic respect for other people despite their income or the gdp of the country they live in. \n\nYour experiences growing up are irrelevant."]}
