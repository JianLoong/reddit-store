I simply explained how this can happen and be a mistake as opposed to malicious.", "It's not about being grateful, and I do agree that soiled pants are disgusting, but it is about how we are perceived.\n\nA simple, \"Thanks for the clothes. I really appreciate it, but I had to run a wash as you accidentally added a pair of soiled pants.\" Would have been equally effective and less condescending. \n\nWe all make mistakes, if someone is doing a good deed, and they make a mistake. The last thing they want is to be told off. OP's delivery wasn't the best and hence my judgement.", "I'm not going off on you. You said that you can understand how it might have happened, I said that while that's true it still needs to be called out because it could potentially have caused harm.", "If the way you spoke to her is accurately reflected in this post, I think you went above assertiveness straight to moralizing. She obviously made a mistake, whether or not you can understand how it happened (as a new mom myself I can clearly see how the mistake occurred - off the top of my head, she had a basket of clean laundry sitting out, husband/partner changed the toddler next and, just seeing a pile of toddler laundry and not checking if it's dirty or clean, through the dirty stuff on top. Then mom comes back and folds it all blindly, in a rush, trying to get things done). You could have thrown the pants out and told her later in a laughing manner. I don't understand why you are so pissed off about a clear mistake."]}
