Your sister seems to treat them more as a nuisance in her life than working to meet their needs!  SHE is making herself look like a pretty self-centered mom who isn't present when her kids seem to need her attentions.  Please stay involved in their lives because you are important when it comes to helping build up their sense of self-worth and value.  They trust you and know they can go to you.", "NTA.  Hate to break it to your sis, but she actually does sound like a \"bad mom\".  Paid her dues and earned her freedom?  Seriously?", "NTA. You are in a really rough situation with someone that lacks some fundamental skills as a parent. I really feel for you.

Her husband is just as bad; very lazy and comes from a wealthy family who handed him everything. I would really like to see them both take more of an active interest in their sons' lives, but I can't force them to.\n\nI'm just trying to be there for those boys.

You sounds like an awesome aunt.", "I always reply \"No, you're making yourself look bad. If you don't want to look bad, do something about it.\"", "Being a mother means putting your children's needs above your own sometimes & she didn't earn sht she was an absent mother from the start when she started dropping them off all day to be watched by you & your mother. I know that you enjoyed this bonding time but what she did was repeatedly abandoned her children to work on her image because she's more important than being there for her children. Does she think they're trophies & not actual human beings with basic wants & needs? The children barely have a bond with their own mother & that's deplorable; even working mothers find time to bond with their children."]}
