He wanted to make you arlnd your child uncomfortable to throw his weight around.  You work, fix things, and cook, and clean...what does he do?  He is being verbally disparaging.  But overall,  this was about abuse.", "NTA. Seriously, how the hell is it \"privileged\" to *offer to fix something yourself and then do it?* That's just straight-up misapplication of a word. I'd say that, if anything, assuming somebody else would do it for you would be the privileged stance there.", "He is completely unwilling to consider replacing the water heaters at another time.

As home owners, we have to figure it out sometimes. \nI started doing oil changes and other maintenance on my own car, YouTube is great. He doesn't want me to touch his truck but won't tell me why.

After energy saving rebate/tax rebate, it ends up being about 500 bucks more for a installed tankless vs him replacing two water heaters himself.\nPart of the issue is his own self confidence. He has had to completely cut contact with his dad due to severe behavioral issues from his dad and that's who he would normally turn to for help so he feels like he has no one. He won't reach out to my dad or brother in law for help and they would love to help him/us!", "He told me if I broke anything it will be all my fault and that I'm on my own to deal with any issues I cause.", "I was only worried I couldn't get the old pipe off due to lack of strength.

He's TA, not you.\n\nWell done, and next time he tries to bully you into compliance remember \"you can fix your things\" and \"you can love yourself better than he can\".

You did a great job and I hope your husband starts to realize how good he has it with you soon enough.", "Agreed. Boomer mentality.

I've always been very independent and I have a high level career/education. I love my husband very much, I CHOOSE to love him. I don't NEED a man if that makes sense. I could hire someone or have my dad help etc, I choose to be with my husband which I see as a good thing. He sees that as offensive. Curious what other people may think of this, I basically saw it as compliment to him but he told me it absolutely isnt.", "I'm sorry but your mom sounds toxic. It sounds like those who would tell their daughters to return to their abusive husbands because they were married.", "To be fair, I shouldn't be getting frustrated towards our son, I get that. But I'm just at a breaking point I suppose.", "Absolutely, and I agree. And my husband agrees. We've both got careers and separate activities and friends. But we CHOOSE to be a family. And we chose to have children after much discussion. There was no \"needing\" for the sake of functioning, or feeling accomplished. We bring eachother joy and we are 100% partners on this ride. \n\nAs for DIY, spouse definitely feels inadequate. If I don't know what to do or have time... he reads the manual, goes to the hardware store or watches YouTube videos to figure it out.", "That's the only reason why people should be in relationships: because they choose and want to, not because they need it.\n\nHowever, it seems that you married your mother (someone with the same gender roles as her).\n\nTake care and keep holding your ground. You are not the a$$hole.", "It sounds like your husband is struggling to leave behind the old definition of \"masculine.\" Many men still feel pressured to be the provider and protector. Depending on how he was raised, and the surrounding culture, it can be hard to get rid of that insecure voice that says you're not enough. In a way, your husband heard your words through a 'filter' created by that mindset. Your intentions were loving and supportive, and I'm sorry that's not how they were received.", "You weren\u2019t at your son, you were at the situation. Don\u2019t beat yourself up.", "NTA.

As a woman Home Depot associate constantly being underestimated about the knowledge I have, I love seeing these stories. Let him feel inadequate. That\u2019s not your problem. You should feel so proud for taking care of it!!! And I\u2019m sure whoever helped you at the store would laugh to know he feels inadequate about it!", "So happy for you, OP. He sounds like he's stressed about other things and has misplaced frustrations. Good on you! \n\nHe should be glad he can take a warm shower tonight. Maybe he'll have some time to think while he's in there alone. \ud83e\udd14", "Okay, that is straight up spiteful and petty. I\u2019d put my foot down about this, this little pissy tantrum has to end. I don\u2019t know whether he needs therapy or has just always kind of been like this, but he does not get to attack you for saving a large amount of money and keeping your family sanitary. If he can\u2019t deal with the fact that his wife is handier than him, tough shit. He can either keep up or shut up.", "Oh, definitely, lol. And also you now have a new skill, yay!", "I think the difference is I was willing to at least TRY to fix it myself. He never even tried. He just kept saying the pipe was too brittle and that it would cause worse issues. Yes, the copper pipe was brittle and had sediment but I told him that didn't matter because that segment is getting replaced. I broke the pipe in half and then removed it \ud83e\udd23 replaced that segment with a shut off valve and everything so if issues arise we can turn it off at that site. The guy at home depot came in clutch. My husband was saying how no one at home depot knows what they are doing so it isn't worth asking anyone there. I had quite the contrary experience and I was so grateful to the man who got me exactly what I needed.", "I did let it slip to the associate that my husband wasn't happy I was going rogue \ud83e\udd23 he had me replace the copper with a pex segment and a connector piece that I just had to push together, so easy!!\nI bet that has to get so old with people underestimating you at work!", "We do split the work for sure. I work shift work so when I'm gone, it is like 14 hour work days but when I'm home, I take on most things and vice versa. It was frustrating in the moment when I was voicing my concerns as the one trying to clean a couple days worth of dishes because I thought I would have had hot water by then and I was realizing 4 more days wasn't gonna work for me.", "Yeah, I'm pretty sure he's mad because he was wrong and she fixed it and she's a woman.", "We are both stressed so the context is important. I was proud of myself for not running to him an apologizing since that's a really bad trait of mine. I get being frustrated with a situation, not ok to take it out on me just because I happen to be the only other person to take it out on.\nHopefully today will be better and we can smooth it over and be adults about it instead of calling the other names etc.", "We have both gone to therapy. He recognizes this about himself, just not in the moment. He tends to get a short fuse and reacts. I've learned to just walk away and not engage in that behavior. Once he starts name calling or being derogatory towards me directly, I completely disengage. That's what happened here. He started name calling so I said, I'll do this myself and left for home depot.", "He's mad because he was wrong", "You are a STAR he needs to defer to your common sense more in general.", "Your husbands comment about no one at Home Depot knowing anything really just pissed me off. As with all jobs you have people there as min wage workers who don\u2019t know much. But Home Depot and lowes do look for people with building experience to hire. \n\nI suspect husband is being misygonistic and is butthurt his wife did a manly thing he refused to do. \n\nNTA.", " Is he normally this dismissive? Because honestly, he just sounds like a jerk", "My husband and I went through this as well. I can do everything he can. He truly thought since I didn\u2019t NEED him that meant I didn\u2019t WANT him. \n\nWe went to marriage counseling to work through it.", "Okay if this is a recurring pattern then you have bigger problems. You have lied to yourself if you think this type of behavior is in any way normal or therapist-approved. \n\nHim having a short fuse and reacting (and \u201cnot recognizing it in the moment\u201d) would be you interrupting him in the middle of something, him snapping \u201cOne minute, okay?!\u201d and then later apologizing. This is how that short fuse problem might rear its head in a normal relationship.\n\nName calling is not okay. Being directly derogatory is not okay. BEING UPSET OVER THIS SCENARIO IS IN NO WAY OKAY.\n\nGod damn there are standards for how we treat people, and he isn\u2019t treating you like anyone in a relationship should. You disengaging is a defense mechanism when he hurls vicious verbal abuse at you. Has his \u201cshort fuse\u201d ever led to him laying a hand on you or your child?", "I've had great experience with workers at Lowes or home depot helping me out so many times. Even funnier because my husband worked at home depot when he was 18 for just a year or two. \nI acknowledge I can he very stubborn, but most of the time, that has been a good trait, not a bad one. I did the same when our solar went out 2 weeks ago, I was too stubborn in a good way and peristsed and got it easily fixed instead of waiting weeks to have an installer come out.", "Yes he is frequently dismissive. Grew up with a dad that constantly told him to get over it, you don't actually feel that way etc. My husband recognizes this but it is still his default attitude especially when angry or stressed. We have both been to therapy and he realized that he literally doesn't know how to feel emotions because of this from his dad. He is working on it but these moments really suck to deal with.", "Unfortunately my husband grew up with a terribly toxic (worst of the worst narcissistic) father, which is why he is no contact with him after he has multiple affairs leading to his parents divorce. His mother is a push over and a pleaser, she would have probably stayed with the guy if it wasn't for people begging her not to. My husband and I have gone to therapy for a time. He recognizes he has some personality traits from his dad and it really scares him when he does things that are similar. His worst fear is becoming his dad but in the moment he doesn't always have the self control to recognize how he is literally being just like his dad. He always feels bad after, as we all do from messing up but sometimes those hurts leave a wound that scars, you can't take it completely away. I'm hoping today can be a better day. I tend to be the one to apologize first, for everything because my mom raised us that we would literally get the silent treatment for days if we weren't the ones to apologize, no matter the real cause. Not gonna be apologizing for this one. \nWhat really probably set my husband off, was I started to day I was feeling like we needed a better solution than waiting 4 more days and I felt like this wasn't getting taken care of for our home. He said he did take care of it by calling places to come fix it. I replied with saying anyone, including myself, is perfectly capable of calling around to have someone come out but that I wanted a solution sooner. That's when it became about me being privledged and impatient.", "It is an outdated mentality to have a woman NEED a man etc. I want his companionship and all the things that are beyond simply doing the \"manly\" things.", "Not therapist approved at all. I've told him that being frustrated about a situation is different than specifically saying nasty things about me as a person. He agrees and apologizes but it still happens at times. Never physical at all. I've tried to use phrases that would trigger him to recognize in the moment but the best we have been able to do is when he tells me to stop because he is getting too mad, then I give him space and then we come together at a later time.", "You don\u2019t have to answer, but I want you to ask yourself this: Why would he change? If all it takes to keep you from leaving is periodically apologizing and pretending to have some big epiphany (which he later \u201cforgets\u201d) that it\u2019s actually not right to verbally abuse you. If you won\u2019t leave him as long as he (sometimes) apologizes and takes (some of) the blame, why would he change?"]}
