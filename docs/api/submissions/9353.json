If anything, paying for someone else to do it would be more along those lines. \n\nYou also have a 2 year old in the house and not having hot water with a toddler is just not okay.", "What? He\u2019s mad that you fixed it? And said you\u2019re privileged for not waiting a few days to pay somebody else to fix it? What?", "NTA. You saved your family thousands of dollars and he had a fit because he didn\u2019t want to figure it out himself. If anyone is entitled it\u2019s him for thinking he\u2019s too good to do it. \n\nI do my own plumbing, too. Doing my own maintenance is one reason why my house is paid off.

NTA all the way! \n\nGoing to a tankless system may be ideal for you, but that doesn't solve the immediate problem of no hot water. \n\nYou got the information and parts needed to get the problem resolved and did it.

But he's probably right about replacing the water heater. Those things have a life expectancy of 15 years before they should be replaced. In my building (europe) we have to switch them out by 15 years or insurance won't cover damages if they burst.", "NTA. Every time he jumps in the shower from now until Friday, turn the hot water off. \nSanitized plates and utensils are not luxuries. Not freezing your a$$ off in the shower is not a luxury. And if he thinks it is, let him go without.", "NTA- but I'm going to break something to you- he is abusive.  He is controlling,  he wants to ruin financially so he gets more control.  He wanted to make you arlnd your child uncomfortable to throw his weight around.  You work, fix things, and cook, and clean...what does he do?  He is being verbally disparaging.  But overall,  this was about abuse.", "NTA. Seriously, how the hell is it \"privileged\" to *offer to fix something yourself and then do it?* That's just straight-up misapplication of a word. I'd say that, if anything, assuming somebody else would do it for you would be the privileged stance there.", "He is completely unwilling to consider replacing the water heaters at another time. I'm so worried about all of our expenses with our flooded basement etc.", "Exactly how I was feeling. I got fed up when I was scraping off dishes in freezing cold water from the dinner I made for us while he relaxed \ud83d\ude11", "His exact words were hot water is a privilege and we can function just fine without it until it is fixed. I spent a total of 40 bucks for new piping etc. We already had the tools needed. It was extremely simple to do.", "Thanks for this comment. With how prices are I just feel like we can't be having a professional do every single thing. As home owners, we have to figure it out sometimes. \nI started doing oil changes and other maintenance on my own car, YouTube is great. He doesn't want me to touch his truck but won't tell me why. I think he doesn't trust that I can do it. He grew up in a household where they got things brand new all the time. Not me! My family scrounged. My dad is a brick mason.", "I figured my nasty self alone would have been an incentive but I guess not \ud83e\udd23 he was prepared to go a full week without me properly showing \ud83d\ude2c", "I'm gonna enjoy my clean dishes and hot shower tonight \ud83e\udd23", "For a tankless system we will have to change the size of the gas line and pressure of the line so fair that he doesn't wanna mess with that and wants a professional install because of that. After energy saving rebate/tax rebate, it ends up being about 500 bucks more for a installed tankless vs him replacing two water heaters himself.\nPart of the issue is his own self confidence. He has had to completely cut contact with his dad due to severe behavioral issues from his dad and that's who he would normally turn to for help so he feels like he has no one. He won't reach out to my dad or brother in law for help and they would love to help him/us!", "He told me if I broke anything it will be all my fault and that I'm on my own to deal with any issues I cause.", "I was only worried I couldn't get the old pipe off due to lack of strength. Once I got it off, I knew I could do it all by myself!", "Your mum needs to update herself. It's not your job to cater for your husband's small ego. He had the chance to do it but he preferred to spend 4k to save his precious hands from labour work.\n\nHe needs to grow up and your mother needs to be quiet and mind her own misogynistic home.", "Yeah we both agree they are a ticking time bomb and we need to replace our system. \nI'm just glad we have hot water for now instead of waiting another 4 days \ud83d\ude01", "Since depts are  problems for both, financial decisions must be made by both as well. If he is feeling inadequate because you showed so much more capabilities in this case this is his problem, and you can offer to talk to him about it (maybe telling him the things he is doing for the family) , but ruining your finances for it is not a good option.", "Why are you doing all the cooking and washing up? Does he do half of the chores?", "He\u2019s lost the plot. You did amazing", "Sticky gross toddlers need baths, too. Your hubs is an odd one.", "Depending on where you live, it\u2019s a Legal Requirement and with a child the refusal to take steps to provide such is a crime. \n\nYou are NTA for getting hot water - even temporarily - to the sinks and bathtubs / showers of your home.", "Well if that's how he feels, he can deprive himself of that privilage and go wash himself with a garden hose, but only once a week cause cold water aint free either.\n\nNTA, you did great.", "It's only a privilege in the developing world. I've been without hot water for a short period (and managed...just) but it is *essential* when you have a toddler and it's not summer.\n\nYou can't get a bath in that situation. Trust me, I tried but even filling every large pot we owned to heat water on the hob (which made them very heavy to carry to the bathroom - which was off the kitchen but then this was a long time ago), it still put barely an inch in the overall bath. By the time the second lot of water had boiled up, the water in the bath had cooled down. \n\nEnsuring you have the basic resources to see to your household hygiene is **not** a privilege.", "And he calls you entitled! Ha!", "Your husband is being sexist. He\u2019s insecure because you can fix things and he doesn\u2019t know how.  He doesn\u2019t want you touching his truck because you\u2019re a woman.  That\u2019s why he won\u2019t tell you, there\u2019s no other reason other than that or he feels emasculated or both.", "Like a boss \ud83d\ude0e", "Your husband needs to swallow his pride. He's TA, not you.\n\nWell done, and next time he tries to bully you into compliance remember \"you can fix your things\" and \"you can love yourself better than he can\". Maybe you should start singing Miley Cyrus' song at home while washing your dishes and he's chilling (according to your comments). He needs a wake-up call and to step up.", "Good for you! You did a great job and I hope your husband starts to realize how good he has it with you soon enough.", "Agreed. Boomer mentality. Isn't the first time she has made comments to me that I need to make my husband \"feel needed\" such as asking him to open jars for me \ud83d\ude11", "I got visibly frustrated today when our boy starting rubbing himself in his banana and cottage cheese.... usually nothing a bath can't solve but without hot water a rag wasn't cutting it! Husband said I needed to get over it.", "Correct, hot water isn't a \"luxury\" item", "My thoughts exaclty!", "I've wondered what other people have thought about what I'm gonna say. I've always been very independent and I have a high level career/education. I love my husband very much, I CHOOSE to love him. I don't NEED a man if that makes sense. I could hire someone or have my dad help etc, I choose to be with my husband which I see as a good thing. He sees that as offensive. Curious what other people may think of this, I basically saw it as compliment to him but he told me it absolutely isnt.", "I'm sorry but your mom sounds toxic. It sounds like those who would tell their daughters to return to their abusive husbands because they were married.", "To be fair, I shouldn't be getting frustrated towards our son, I get that. But I'm just at a breaking point I suppose.", "Absolutely, and I agree. And my husband agrees. We've both got careers and separate activities and friends. But we CHOOSE to be a family. And we chose to have children after much discussion. There was no \"needing\" for the sake of functioning, or feeling accomplished. We bring eachother joy and we are 100% partners on this ride. \n\nAs for DIY, spouse definitely feels inadequate. If I don't know what to do or have time... he reads the manual, goes to the hardware store or watches YouTube videos to figure it out.", "That's the only reason why people should be in relationships: because they choose and want to, not because they need it.\n\nHowever, it seems that you married your mother (someone with the same gender roles as her).\n\nTake care and keep holding your ground. You are not the a$$hole.", "It sounds like your husband is struggling to leave behind the old definition of \"masculine.\" Many men still feel pressured to be the provider and protector. Depending on how he was raised, and the surrounding culture, it can be hard to get rid of that insecure voice that says you're not enough. In a way, your husband heard your words through a 'filter' created by that mindset. Your intentions were loving and supportive, and I'm sorry that's not how they were received.", "You weren\u2019t at your son, you were at the situation. Don\u2019t beat yourself up."]}
