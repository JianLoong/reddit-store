Then she made a joke about how opposite my twins are. I laughed along because I really did not understand what she was implying.\n\nShe finally got to the point though and asked if my daughter could just do a solo instead of having my son join. I asked her why and she awkwardly explained that she fit the themes of her wedding better. \u201cNo offence of course, your son\u2019s great... he\u2019s just a bit much.

It would crush my son if he was asked to back out. I asked her if she would be willing to tell my son. She said no that she\u2019s not his parent. I just told her that I\u2019m not going to be the one to break my son\u2019s heart. \n\nShe called me a difficult old woman (I\u2019m only 5 years older than her LOL) who\u2019s going to ruin her special day.

But they\u2019re not the ones who\u2019ve been listening to him talk about how excited he is to perform for his uncle (who he sees as his father figure). AITA?

This isn't something you wait even one day to address.

This isn't a thing you wait to talk about because then it becomes \"why are you making such a big deal NOW? You didn't mention it for (x amount of time) so it must not have been that important\", which is kind of the vibe your responses have given.

She's being assholeish because she's just being difficult and nasty but I'm not sure if her request itself is unreasonable.\n\nDid your brother discuss it with her before he asked formally, or was it more of her thinking about possibilities and him taking the initiative and asking when she wasn't dead set or had ironed out the details of what she wanted. If she was so particular wouldn't she have asked only your daughter from the beginning. The \"vibe\" of the wedding should have been a part of the request too and they should have at least given examples of songs or performances. Was there any request beyond that they perform 'something'.\n\nI'm sure that both of your children are musically talented but voice type does play into it. Even if your son isn't singing a rock song, its possibly that his voice just isn't the vibe she's looking for if she wants a sweeter tone or more classical style which is why she is favouring your daughter. Even if both of them sing the same song, both can sound totally different. \n\nAlso, is this just a random performance, or is it the walking down the aisle, or first song/ father-daughter dance? If it's a special performance I feel like her request should be honoured but if not then it won't 'ruin' her day to have one singular song that doesn't fit the vibe and you are completely entitled to be upset and stick to your guns.\n\nAsk your brother if they both discussed the details thoroughly before he asked and if she did change her mind, she sucks for not thinking things through beforehand but ultimately she and your brother need to iron out the details together. \n\nIf it's a special performance and she was sure when she asked them to perform but now changed her mind, yeah it sucks but ultimately I do think her request should be honoured if only to avoid blowing this conflict up even more. I do think he should be allowed to perform sometime during the night. They have the right to decide what the want in their wedding at the end of the day but it would feel excessively mean spirited to exclude him because his 5 minute song doesn't fit her aesthetic. \n\nA lot of people tend to jump to extremes or petty bitch mode but I think the best thing is to first thing first let your brother and her settle on a more specific vision for what they want, and your kids can record samples of what they intend to perform so that bride can get settled and come to a more concrete decision. \n\nHonestly it really depends on what type of performance this is and whether this was a mutual decision and not just a 'musing' of hers. If she wasn't a 100% sure and having to now take back the request she wasn't even sure about in he first place would be really stressful and awkward *as well as* 100% unfair to your kids.
