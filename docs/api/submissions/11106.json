My daughter\u2019s in choir and son\u2019s in a band so they\u2019re both musically talented and they love their uncle to bits so they were over the moon and began planning something immediately. \n\nWell a couple days ago I got a phone call from my future SIL. She was talking about how she wants her wedding to be perfect and have a very \u201cdelicate\u201d vibe. In other words, \u201cpure\u201d and \u201cangelic\u201d. Then she made a joke about how opposite my twins are. I laughed along because I really did not understand what she was implying.\n\nShe finally got to the point though and asked if my daughter could just do a solo instead of having my son join. I asked her why and she awkwardly explained that she fit the themes of her wedding better. \u201cNo offence of course, your son\u2019s great... he\u2019s just a bit much.

He\u2019s more into rock and stuff like that, his hair is messy and he dresses exactly the way you\u2019re imagining but he\u2019s not a bad kid. And it\u2019s not like he was going to play a crazy rock and roll song at the wedding either... and he wasn\u2019t going to show up in baggy ripped jeans or whatever. \n\nI told my future SIL that what she was requesting was really unfair and that my brother asked the both of them. It would crush my son if he was asked to back out. I asked her if she would be willing to tell my son. She said no that she\u2019s not his parent. I just told her that I\u2019m not going to be the one to break my son\u2019s heart. \n\nShe called me a difficult old woman (I\u2019m only 5 years older than her LOL) who\u2019s going to ruin her special day. She yelled at me some more about not taking responsibility as his parent before hanging up. Her sister texted me some time later saying that my son\u2019s a big boy and he\u2019ll be fine. But they\u2019re not the ones who\u2019ve been listening to him talk about how excited he is to perform for his uncle (who he sees as his father figure). AITA?
