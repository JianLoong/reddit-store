My wife doesn't mind what gender the baby is she just wanted to get a few friends and family together for a small party and she was under the impression that I thought that too. Neither of us were interested in doing anything big, we just had a friend to read out the letter and reveal the gender.\n\nI didn't tell my wife this but I was really hoping for a daughter instead of a son so when it was revealed that we'll be having a boy it really upset me. I didn't want to ruin the day though so I just tried to act normal and celebrate with my wife and the family.\n\nLater on after everyone had left, I was alone in our room whilst my wife was downstairs. I was sitting on the bed and just started crying. I don't often cry I think it's a waste of my time and unnecessary but I was just really panicking. \n\nI really wanted a daughter because my dad was really shitty to me and he messed me up a lot I'm. scared that I will be the same to my son. I don't want to fuck my son up like my dad did to me. I've been scared about turning into my dad since before I met my wife, the big reason I didn't want kids originally was in case I treated them like my dad treated me. \n\nMy wife walked in on me crying and I tried to explain why without talking about my dad much (she doesn't know anything about what my dad was like.) She told me that I was selfish and called me a few other things. Then told me to sleep on the couch.\n\nShe hasn't really been the same with me since, she's still really annoyed.\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEdit: I'm not going to reply to all of the comments but I have read them all so thank you so much, I am going to try and find a way to tell my wife about my childhood I've just never spoken to anyone about it before.", "created_utc": 1699883652, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ub4cb/aita_for_crying_after_my_babys_gender_was_revealed/", "score": 2658, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I had a shitty mom and I know that even in my forties it still affects me in many ways.  Overcoming childhood trauma is HARD.  It takes work.  But you need to do the work, and here you are studiously avoiding doing the work.  You're walking around with trauma that your wife knows nothing about because you're burying it.  You're having a child with someone who doesn't know all the fears you have about having a child because you haven't told her any of them.  You can't get over trauma without facing it.  And becoming a father is a good kick in the butt to start processing your trauma BECAUSE you want to break the cycle of abuse here.\n\nAll your wife can see here is \"I'm really upset because I wanted my baby to have different genitals.\"  Because that's all you're letting her see.  I'm betting she would be way more understanding if she could hear \"I'm upset because my father was terrible to me, I went through terrible things, and I love our son so much that I don't want to do that to him and I'm so afraid.\"  And then start working through the trauma, with a therapist if possible, because it's going to be better for your son and your wife and yourself.  Do it for him if you couldn't do it for yourself.  Let that be his gift to you before he's even here.\n\nI get it... I was TERRIFIED of being like my mom.  I was afraid I would fall into that because I didn't know how else a parent was supposed to be.  I might not have had a good model on how to be a mom, but I had a GREAT model on how NOT to be a mom... and that was enough.  I made plenty of mistakes, but I didn't make THOSE mistakes.  And you won't either, because you know how badly you don't want to be that kind of dad.  \n\nWishing you all the best as you go forward here.  Talk to your wife.  Get some counseling.  Take the time to love yourself here.  You're going to be a great dad to your son.", "I don't think you're TA but I do think you have some room here to grow. \n\nStart reading parenting books, learn more how to respond to tantrums (and whatever else you're worried about) so you're ready when they happen. \n\nReflect even more now on what your dad did wrong and think about how you'll do differently. \n\nCommunicate more with your wife. \n\nMaybe pursue therapy. Crying has benefits, you shouldn't not be crying because you think it's a waste of time. \n\nAnd finally: dads can be crappy to girls and boys alike. But they can also be wonderful to both. Just because you're having a boy doesn't automatically mean you'll be an AH. Start learning now and get ready for the chaotic wonderful years to come.", "Ok so I similar thing happened with my partner. He wanted a girl simply for the fact that his dad treated him like shit and abandoned him a lot and he thought having a girl would stop him repeating history. He didn\u2019t cry and was obviously happy the baby was healthy when we got the scan but it was still a concern of his. \n\nWhat actually happened though is the opposite, so our son looks like a carbon coby of my partner when he was young, photos of him young you can\u2019t tell the difference between them. This has made him more protective of him as he can\u2019t believe his dad treated this cute little boy like that (imagining it being him when he was young). He looks at our son and thinks \u201cin a couple of years this was the time I was sent off to a horrible boarding school, I can\u2019t imagine ever doing this to our son, just look at him, how young he is\u201d. So it\u2019s actually had the opposite effect. I\u2019m not saying your son will look exactly like you but that doesn\u2019t matter, I think you will feel super protective of him and you won\u2019t want to repeat the same mistakes.", "So.. you are not TA for crying, or panicking, or freaking out. But a soft, gentle YTA for not sharing this with your wife though I get that in a moment of fear and panic, digging deep and pulling something like that out can be difficult. A lot of mentions here about gender disappointment but I'd gander that's not what's happening here, it rather sounds more like some sort of trauma response. Your dad was really shitty to you (his son) and you're terrified of being a shit father to your son and you believe you may escape that if you had a daughter. Now I want to tell you that while it absolutely makes no logical sense at all, I 100% understand how it is something your mind can believe. Knowing \u2260 believing. Distance helps, it absolutely helps.\n\nIt's the same way people get scared of dogs because they had a traumatic experience when they were younger. The dogs they meet now are absolutely not the dog that caused that traumatic experience, yet they are still terrified and would never want to be anywhere near a dog. It's not just the fear of a dog but rather what that dog represents (their traumatic experience). Now for someone in that situation the solution is simple for them, never go near a dog. That's tenable because you don't ever have to go near a dog if you don't want to and one can avoid them for life if they so choose.\n\nYour situation deviates from this analogy because no matter what happens now, you're having a son. And I get how confusing it must be for you to be terrified of a moment that should be a jubilant one so I hope what I'm saying helps at least a little, to put things in perspective. You have an amazing opportunity that many peopled don't ever get, and that is to see that the 'thing' you're attaching to your fears, has nothing to do with your fear at all. It sounds ridiculous when said but many times what we know may not equal to what we believe, and you believe that you may be a bad father to your son because your dad was bad to you. But once you start to be a good father, that belief will have no hold on your life at all and you'll see it doesn't matter if you have a son or daughter, you define what kind of parent you are.\n\nAnd think about the head start you have! You already know exactly what **not** to do!", "NAH: I hate to call you an a\u2019hole because once you explained why you cried, I really got it. And it\u2019s kind of heartbreaking. But you didn\u2019t explain any of that to our wife who just thinks you\u2019re upset about the gender for shallow reasons. \n\nI really hope you go to therapy or even just a support group. You deserve to feel better about yourself and your capabilities. You can also find parenting classes and groups. The fact that you want to be a good dad already means you\u2019re better than your dad and I have every confidence in you that you can be a great dad.", "You need to talk to your wife about your trauma not reddit NAH", "YTA, but not for crying.\n\nYour wife thinks you are selfish because you wanted one thing and got another and now you don't feel happy about your child. Because you are unwilling to open up about the real reason you were feeling emotional, she reacted in a way that felt acceptable- she feels like this is your child to love regardless, and here you are moping.\n\nNot communicating about things like this is what causes conflicts. You need to go to her, apologize that you upset her on what was meant to be a happy day for you all- and then EXPLAIN EXACTLY HOW YOU ARE FEELING. Meaning you need to talk about whatever happened between you and your father. Now that you are going to be a parent, these things are going to come out in you- you are going to feel emotionally triggered sometimes, and she's going to be totally in the dark. I agree that you should write it out if talking about it is hard.\n\nOP, you won't be like your dad. You are literally crying worried that you will hurt this kid and the kid isn't even here yet. You are 100% in control of how you parent your kid, and if you do it with love, patience, and understanding with a goal of mutual respect, you will be FINE. You need to consider therapy before your child is born.\n\nI had many disappointments in my relationship with my mother when I was younger. As a mom to girls, I've found it very, very healing to be able to be the parent to them that I wish I had had.", "Yes, YTA.\n\nFor not talking to your wife about your childhood trauma. Yes it's trauma because it's impacting who you are as a man and who you think you'll be as a father.\n\nFot not communicating to her when you talked about having kids, that you have such a strong preference for a daughter.\n\nFor somehow thinking that if you inherited something from your dad, it would have been'safe' if you had a daughter. (?)\n\nFor presumably not getting counselling or help to deal with this issue?\n\nHopefully for your son's sake, you'll open up to your wife, get some help, and realize you can absolutely be an amazing father to anyone.\n\nPlease open up to her, get some help, you three will be a family for many many years....you want the best I'm sure.", "NAH - talk to your wife. You seem to be trying to deal with a lot of stuff, refusing help and even denying yourself crying. It doesn\u2019t matter what you are dealing with, however big or small: if you don\u2019t actually deal with it at all it will pile up until it overwhelms you.\n\nThis might have worked for you thus far in your life. But it is unfair to your wife and to yourself. And there is a baby now, I promise you this will tested the limits of you and your wife\u2019s ability to cope with stress. If she is unaware now of your worries and if you are moved to tears by them, wait until the baby is crying for the third hour in a row without stopping. Until neither of you has slept for longer than 2 hours consecutively for weeks.\n\nTalk to your wife. Find ways to indicate and recognise when the other person needs help, or rest so you can help or back off before your partner reaches breaking point. Get therapy if you can.", "So kinda yta, you shouldn\u2019t hold your wife at arms length like this when you\u2019re about to have a baby. You clearly are very affected by how your father raised you and your not giving your wife the context of why you are upset. You\u2019re tying her hands behind her back in her being able to support you. \n \nYou need therapy and it\u2019s actually cruel of you to make your wife go through this  without her knowing what\u2019s happening. You can\u2019t keep this bottled up because it will destroy your marriage. Be honest with her and let her know your past and why yiu reacted that way and how you will need support and reassurance from her while you parent because you were never given a good example. \n\nIf yiu love your wife, you should trust her enough to be vulnerable and get her help", "ESH. She judged you without knowing the context. You aren't getting therapy and were hoping the gender of a baby would make a difference, which is ridiculous. \n\n\"Honey, I don't want to talk about my dad so please don't ask questions. But just know that I am not sad about having a son. I'm just scared I won't be a good father to a son because of what my dad was like. I don't want to talk about my dad. I'm going to look for a therapist in the morning.\"", "Just out of interest, why would you \"fuck up\" your son but not a daughter? Why would you treat a son and daughter differently? Why would you commit to having children with this fear? It's not fair on your wife. Sorry for your shitty dad but in this situation, YTA.", "NTA for feeling your feelings, however mixed up they are, but YTA for expressing them out loud, that's so dreadfully damaging.\nYou ripped the floor out of her life at what should be a happy moment.\n\n\u2022 GET THERAPY ASAP to work through this unhealthy feeling \n\n\u2022 TELL YOUR WIFE YOUR HISTORY!  She really needs to know what is behind this. She's on your side. Or she was, before you blindsided her.\n\n\u2022 TAKE THIS SECRET TO THE GRAVE, your child must NEVER hear of this.\n\n\u2022 You WON'T become your father, precisely because you are scared of becoming him. You are ceaselessly on guard against repeating his mistakes. You can do this with a son, you'll be fine. The very fact that you are scared of fucking it up is the best possible guarantee that you won't. \n\n\n\nGood luck.", "I don't think there's an AH here, but you REALLY need to talk to your wife about your dad and your fears. This should have happened before you even got her pregnant but it needs to happen now because as a mother I fully understand why she's upset with you right now. If she doesn't know your trauma she can't possibly understand what your fears are. Talk to her man, openly and honestly and vulnerable. Tell her everything. This doesn't have to drive a wedge between you, you can come out of this even stronger than before.", "NAH, your wife doesn't know WHY you're reacting so strongly because you haven't communicated any of these feelings with her. And you're not an AH either, you've got some trauma there from your relationship with your dad that you need to work through so I'd definitely find a professional to talk to to help as well.\n\nBut just to note, it's not set in stone that you'll turn out to be like your father boy or girl. It's good you're recognising a fear of yours here and with some therapy/counselling and talking with your wife about how you feel it's a great starting point to make sure you'll be the best dad you can be. Try not to see this as a gender issue, your kid will be there own person and your job is to love and support them. But you can't do that without breaking down these fears you have from your own trauma. Embrace openness and honesty with your partner and hopefully you'll feel much better about the future. Good luck and I wish your new family well!", "I saw the first half and was ready to go in all guns blazing but having read it all currently no, I'd say this is NAH\n\nBut\n\nIf you don't get therapy to work through your trauma then you will be TA. The gender of your baby will not decide if you are a good parent or not and you are not destined to become your father. But you need to work through this for everyones sake.", "Well, cannot really say you are an AH. But, you should talk about what you went througj with your wife and reconcile.", "NTA.\nBut you need to be more open to your wife and communicate with her. It\u2019s ok to be scared as soon to be parent, and since you had a traumatizing person of a dad, it\u2019s obviously ok. But your wife just thought you were crying cause you didn\u2019t wanted a boy. So you should be more communicative with your wife and take some parenting classes to prepare beforehand. \nHope you will do good in future.", "NTA for being scared... But you should absolutely explain to your wife what happened with your dad and why you're scared. This is not something you can avoid mentioning at this point.", "NAH. You could've explained better, but as someone with childhood trauma, I get what you feel. Long answer here but please read it if you want things to turn out better from now on. \n\nI understand your concern, even though I don't think having a female child would automatically stop you from acting that way. When I was having a vulnerable time as a child, I was abused by someone who's supposed to take care of me. In my teens, I repeatedly abused two vulnerable people I was supposed to take care of even though part of me cared about them and felt extremely guilty. My relationship to both hardly resembled my abuser's relationship to me and I didn't abuse them the same way I was abused, but regardless, I subconsciously wanted people to feel the suffering I felt and acted on it. Lots of traumatized people do horrible things to others and I'm glad you're aware it's possible even if you try to be a good person.   \nThat being said, you're not going to get better or prevent yourself from becoming a shitty parent if you don't face your trauma and recover from it. I'm not going to simply tell you to go to therapy like many other commenters because I know how challenging and expensive it is to find a therapist who actually helps. Even if you do, you still need to play your own part in recovery by figuring out what's happening and what you can do to help yourself. For this, I strongly recommend reading *Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving* by Pete Walker (free PDF at [`https://blobby.wsimg.com/go/a7124a00-f63c-4010-bbdc-5020f1cf45aa/Complex%20PTSD_%20From%20Surviving%20to%20Thriving%20(%20PDF.pdf`)](https://blobby.wsimg.com/go/a7124a00-f63c-4010-bbdc-5020f1cf45aa/Complex%20PTSD_%20From%20Surviving%20to%20Thriving%20(%20PDF.pdf)), I can't link an inline URL for some reason. The book really puts into perspective how various types of shitty parenting affects a child and how you can eventually break free from its negative effects as an adult. I've learned so much from the book alone and made a lot of progress recovering while I took a break from therapy. \n\nPete Walker, the author of that book and an experienced therapist specializing in childhood trauma, says that raising a child is the most triggering thing someone with childhood abuse could do. You better get ready since you're going to have to raise a child soon. It's not a waste of time to work on your trauma because you'll become a much better and happier person.", "This sounds like a fake gender swap post. Your wife knows nothing of your family? That makes zero sense. \n\nPretending this is real- if you are so terrified to raise a son that it causes you to panic and cry, you should have trauma therapy before having kids. Don\u2019t roll the dice that- hey, 50/50-ish it will be fine.", "How do you expect your wife to understand your feelings when you don\u2019t communicate them?", "YTA. \n\nGender disappointment is a thing, but the reality here is that you've somehow pinned your ability to not repeat the cycle of poor parenting on the idea of having a girl.\n\nYour wife deserves to know your upbringing and your fears because it plays a crucial role in the trauma and triggers you may have as a parent. You need some therapy OP.\n\nYou need to apologize for ruining the fun and happiness, and then have an earnest heart to heart.", "I think OP also need to go to therapy", "I was thinking you where the arsehole until you told about your father and why you where so upset so you have to EXPLAIN it properly to your wife. Hopefully she should understand", "Yta technically but only because you need to actually talk to her so she can understand why you are actually upset. I don\u2019t know why you haven\u2019t told your wife but now\u2019s the time. This will not be the last time you need to handle your feelings about your own childhood and you\u2019ll be the asshole then too for the same reasons but a lot less technically. You can fix this dynamic right now.", "NTA but it\u2019s time to sit down and tell your wife the truth. She will support you and understand more.", "YTA. This was trauma and expectations to manage BEFORE getting pregnant. Being disappointed that your child is one sex or the other is messed up, no matter what the reason. You need to deal with this ASAP. Your wife is right to be angry, and I'm sure it's going to be hard for her to get over it herself so be patient with her.", "The problem here wasn't your feelings about your father and the lingering pain from his mistreatment, and your fears of being an inadequate father. The problem here is your failure to communicate your feelings to your wife.", "YTA\n\nYou're allowed be scared given your past. But you have 2 options (I recommend 1)\n\n1. Tell her everything\n2. Pretend nothing is wrong\n\nYou can't be openly upset with the person growing a baby and not tell her why. Write it in a letter if talking is hard. Or invite her to a joint therapy session", "NAH. You need to talk to her. Your fears will make you a great parent because you always take care about how you treat your child. She will understand but you need to be honest with her. She is having your baby. Congratulations to both of you.", "Being this invested in the gender of your child is always toxic, regardless of the reason. I highly suggest you get into some therapy and work though these issues sooner than later... Like before the baby is born. You have the chance to be an absolutely amazing dad to your child, and not repeat the cycle, but you are the only one that is in control of that. \n\nI am not going to call you an AH because your fears are valid. But you need to work through everything that is causing these feelings, and anything else negative you still have going on as a result of your dad being such a shitty father, if you want to be a great parent. Regardless of its gender. \n\nI know most guys have issues with going to therapy, but I promise you it will 110% worth it. Just make sure it is with someone you feel you can trust and is a good fit, as not all therapsist are created equal and are humans too. While some can just be crappy at their job, there are also some that you could just not mesh well with too, and that is ok. Trust your instincts and intuition, and you should know within the first couple sessions whether you click with the person or not. Don't be afraid to shop around. I know that sounds like a lot of work, but isn't your child worth it??? You should also feel you are worth it, but that may have to come with time in therapy.", "There was a 50/50 chance and you did nothing at all to prepare for this outcome and is sounds like you knew you would feel this way.\n\n\nYou're having a kid now, so better realllly work on your anticipation and prep work, even when it comes to your hangups/issues.", "Tell your wife about your dad and your fears, ffs. She's not a mind reader. Of course, she thought you were an AH because you're not being totally honest with her. Having a loving relationship with your son could actually be really healing for you.", "NAH - she's your wife and you haven't shared these very important fears - how can she understand that this is tied to your trauma around your father if you don't mention him? You needed to communicate with her years ago, but today is still just as good. \n\nSide note; the gender of the child doesn't matter - a daughter wouldn't have been any easier - you still need to do a lot of self work to unpack the generational bullshit to ensure you're the best dad you can be. You aren't fated to become your dad.", "Yta. Get some therapy.", "The only part where you were the asshole was not explaining in further detail about your relationship with your dad. It\u2019s perfectly alright to have those fears but I can tell you this, you aren\u2019t your father. You have the ability to break that chain and be much better than he is. \n\nTrust, communication and honesty are the cornerstones of any relationship.

Lol", "OP - you NEED to tell your wife about how your experiences have shaped your expectations!\n\nIf she KNEW about your history with your Dad and your fears, I am pretty sure you wouldn't be sleeping on the couch.\n\nTalk to her. Get some therapy or at least read some books about dealing with childhood trauma and making better decisions going forward.

Knowledge is power.", "Not for crying but duuude, you will be the asshole if you treat your son any differently than you would have a daughter.\n\nLook into therapy. NOW.

I'm really sorry but you have to know that, it doesn't matter what gender your child will be you should love and treat them the same way. \n\nYou have the chance to raise your son better than you were, take this opportunity to give him all the love you never recieved. \n\nLet this also be a lesson in why you should communicate wants and fears with your wife, a gender reveal party shouldn't happen if one parent has a really strong preference. Communication would have saved you so much grief.\n\nSoft yta", "NAH due to trauma\n\nYou need to tell your wife about your Dad.

On the surface you would be the A, as a son will be great and you'll be a better Dad because you learned what NOT to do from your father. However, you have some trauma, my friend. So I'm not calling you an A. You need counseling, it'll help you immensely.", "I\u2019m not sure how to vote because you\u2019re not the AH for crying but how are you married to someone who doesn\u2019t know such a big part of your life?", "You need to open up to your wife and begin working with a therapist. I was afraid of this same thing and realized I needed help to unpack my own experience so that I would break the cycle and do better for myself and my child.

If you're struggling now, imagine trying to talk to her when you're both underslept and under intense stress trying to keep a human alive. \n\nRemember it's not all about you - your wife is undergoing a vast physical change on the assumption that the two of you are a team. In the meantime you're withholding critical info and not dealing with your problems.\n\nYou are not doomed to become your father. But there are actions to take here - pursuing therapy, reading books and crucially, talking to your wife. What if you told her what behaviours you fear, so she can be a pair of outside eyes? I presume that neither of you has parenting experience, so you'll be learning together; she will need you to be outside eyes too, you might both make mistakes. \n\nYou're NTA for having trauma, but you decided to have a child, so you do need to step up and deal with it, so that you can become the kind of father that your son deserves - and that you also deserved in the past. You'll have to learn to treat yourself with gentleness that was denied you, while also being the adult and the parent.

Does that make sense? Also I hope you don\u2019t let your boy be alone with your dad if he\u2019s still alive.

My wife doesn't mind what gender the baby is she just wanted to get a few friends and family together for a small party and she was under the impression that I thought that too. Neither of us were interested in doing anything big, we just had a friend to read out the letter and reveal the gender.\n\nI didn't tell my wife this but I was really hoping for a daughter instead of a son so when it was revealed that we'll be having a boy it really upset me. I didn't want to ruin the day though so I just tried to act normal and celebrate with my wife and the family.\n\nLater on after everyone had left, I was alone in our room whilst my wife was downstairs. I was sitting on the bed and just started crying. I don't often cry I think it's a waste of my time and unnecessary but I was just really panicking. \n\nI really wanted a daughter because my dad was really shitty to me and he messed me up a lot I'm. scared that I will be the same to my son. I don't want to fuck my son up like my dad did to me. I've been scared about turning into my dad since before I met my wife, the big reason I didn't want kids originally was in case I treated them like my dad treated me. \n\nMy wife walked in on me crying and I tried to explain why without talking about my dad much (she doesn't know anything about what my dad was like.) She told me that I was selfish and called me a few other things. Then told me to sleep on the couch.\n\nShe hasn't really been the same with me since, she's still really annoyed.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She can't co parent with you effectively if she doesn't know how you feel emotionally.

Trauma is traumatic and you're doing the best that you can. It's hard to acknowledge these things especially when you are still processing it all. \n\nIt speaks volumes to your character that you are worried about becoming your father.  My mother was terribly abusive, I've been in therapy for years. In fact I didn't want to have kids until my later 30s because I was so worried about becoming my mother. After years of therapy and constant work on myself I still struggle with my parenting because sometimes my mother's voice slips out of my mouth. I have a son and it still comes out, so this would have been an issue for you with a daughter anyway.  You will be recovering from your dad's abuse your whole life regardless of the gender/sex of your child.  \n\nGet into action on self improvement. You may need to do some couples counseling too to help your wife understand. You are not a bad person regardless of what anyone says here or elsewhere.

My XX and XY children are all being raised similarly, with same expectations and same chores (we rotate). All of them feel most comfortable coming to me about some things and my husband about others. \n\nI think what will really matter here is that you work to get past your personal feelings here about your father and concentrate instead on how you want to raise your child to break that cycle.

If you feel for whatever reason that you may be \"Turning into\" your father with you son: make sure he is safe (in a room or cot etc) and take a step out: go get a hot drink or have a ciggy (if you smoke), just take five minutes to yourself to get your sense of self together/calm down and *remind yourself*: you ARE NOT you father. \n\nYou are a different person entirely.

You can damage a daughter just as much as you can damage a son and its a little unusual how passionately you see the act of raising them as being so fundamentally different. You need to make sure that you're not projecting your baggage onto your kid- and that's true for whether you had a son or a daughter.\n\nMore immediately- it sounds like you are not communicating with your wife.

Funny enough, the traditional men in our family assured me that there was no pressure to have a boy and I do see my daughter being doted on and given the same opportunities regardless of her gender and I\u2019m so very thankful for that.\n\nSo now, when someone tells me they experience gender disappointment (and I\u2019ve had acquaintances cry in front of me over it), I usually prod and get to the root of their reasoning. More often than not, it\u2019s really not as black and white or sexist\u2014at least, in my experience.", "OP listen to this one and not the people saying YTA for trauma", "yes yes yes. it's so scary confronting trauma, and it can be even scarier to let others see your trauma, but it's the only way to heal and make sure you don't repeat those patterns. white-knuckling it definitely will not help and could hurt. i have bpd and anxiety, and for the longest time i had many of the same coping mechanisms and symptoms (reckless behavior, mood swings, intense irritability and an awful temper, reckless spending, etc) that my dad does (i strongly suspect he also has bpd, but he's never gotten professional help and i don't want to armchair diagnose him). i've done a lot of work on my own (did go to therapy for a while but stopped because between work and school i no longer had the time), but even then, i've looked my trauma fully in the face, looked into resources other than therapy, done my research, and communicated my trauma and my feelings with those close to me. without that communication and that straightforwardness with my trauma (both with others and with myself), everything would fall apart, because trauma isn't something you can just ignore. it affects every part of your inner and outer life. trying to ignore it just makes it come out in unexpected ways at unexpected moments.\n\nmy dad loves the hell out of me - i'm his only child, so i'm all he's got. he wanted to do the best he could for me. that still didn't stop him from fucking me up, because he either couldn't or wouldn't get help for his mental illness. because he didn't learn the necessary coping skills, he was unable to keep it in check, and through his behavior he passed it down to me. he had the best intentions and still it wasn't enough. luckily i'm very self aware and emotionally intelligent (i have no idea how i learned that, because neither of my parents are), so i've been able to do a lot of healing and learn coping mechanisms that mostly keep my symptoms at bay (meds help too). if i were a different person, my dad might have completely ruined me.\n\nop, don't be like my dad. suffering from trauma and/or mental illness doesn't make you a bad or weak person, and on its own it won't make you a bad parent. what will make you a bad parent is not doing everything in your power to heal and learn coping mechanisms - which means getting help to do so, both from your wife and from a professional. you may think you can do it on your own, but having kids tries you in ways you can't even guess at - it will try your patience, it will deprive you of sleep, it will make you worried and anxious, and at times it may trigger your trauma. if you haven't gotten help and done the work, you will not be able to stop that trauma from coming back up and those symptoms from appearing even despite your best efforts. that sounds scary, but it doesn't have to be, because you don't have to handle it all by yourself.\n\ni wish you the best of luck in communicating this to your wife and hopefully finding a professional you trust to help you unpack everything. you can do it if you just take the leap.", "My mom was awful to me. I got my ass beat so hard for little things. And like, I\u2019m not just talking about smacked around or anything (not to diminish any one who went through that) but she used to literally fist fight me as a child like we were in a drunken bar brawl.  When my daughter was born, I was TERRIFIED of disciplining her, because I have severe trauma and anger issues. Not to mention a certain lack of patience as a result of everything I went through. (People who get beat as kids LOVE to say they turned out fine. I\u2019m here to tell you, we did not.) I was scared I would lose control of myself and turn into my mom. \n\nMy daughter will be 17 in a month and I just had a son 3 months ago. I\u2019ve never hit my daughter. (Or my son before someone says anything) There\u2019s been times when I\u2019ve lost my patience and probably screamed at her when I shouldn\u2019t have, but those instances were rare and I\u2019ve always admitted fault. She\u2019s aware of how her grandmother treated me growing up and we\u2019ve both gone to therapy. Me to deal with my trauma, and her to help understand mine, as well as deal with hers from her father. (He wasn\u2019t physically abusive to her, but he had substance abuse issues and was neglectful at best, emotionally abusive and manipulative at worst. She also witnessed some physical abuse towards me). But the thing is, she was a great kid who didn\u2019t need a lot of discipline.  \n\nMy advice to OP is start out on the right foot. Remind yourself daily that kids are kids. They\u2019re learning how to be human. Let them know that they\u2019re entitled to their emotions, but not to be ruled by them. I was scared of tantrums. My daughter never had one because she learned early that negative behavior wasn\u2019t enforced. It wasn\u2019t necessarily punished, but it wasn\u2019t rewarded. It was mostly just ignored. Was that the best way? Probably not. But it seemed to work for her. She\u2019s definitely in tune with how she feels and doesn\u2019t need a lot of guidance. Are there things I\u2019d wish she was better about? Absolutely. But if the worst I have to deal with is a few bad grades and a dirty room, I\u2019ll take it. \n\nAm I absolutely terrified of raising the new baby? Yes. And I\u2019m older now, and my patience is thinner than it was when I was 24. But I\u2019ve also had a lot of therapy and a better partner, so I know that while I\u2019ll slip up, no one will ever be the perfect parent, I\u2019ll also be fine. And so will my children. Besides, and I\u2019m only being slightly sarcastic here, but every one needs just enough trauma to make them funny. My daughter definitely has the right amount.", "My husband was also afraid of being the kind of Dad his father was. He is a wonderful father. I believe part of that has to do with his own conscience decision to NOT be like his father. If anything, it's made him a more aware and present parent.

While my husband does tend to be pretty stoic, over time he told me about his childhood and his relationship to his parents and father in particular.

But i've also seen people create self-fulfilling prophecies with far fewer potential ramifications and still create really sordid outcomes. OP would do well to beware that. He's gonna have to sink or swim, so it's time to start processing trauma and with his wife being part of the process.\n\nor he could just stay bottled up forever and continue being called 'selfish' and told to sleep on the couch, which is a perfectly normal reaction to dad being mad about the baby's gender for seemingly no reason. OP deserves tenderness, understanding, and compassion, but he'll never get it without opening up to her. and in my experience, the longer you delay on an explanation like this, the more likely the other person is to think it's made-up horse shit.\n\nRun, don't walk, OP.
