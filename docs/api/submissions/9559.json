I know Reddit tends to jump to divorce and NC but in this case it's plain that she has zero love or respect for you, so there's no value - and only risk - in having any sort of relationship with her. But you have your cat back, and that's more than compensation.", "NTA", "I'm glad you have your furbaby back! Get him/her chipped so you can always prove it is yours. \nCutting your sister out of your life for this is perfectly fine!", "Umm cats are our emotional support animals, companions, and familiars. I would for sure cut contact for stealing my cat just because I wouldn\u2019t trust them to do it again. NTA", "NTA. Your sister needs help that is way above your pay grade or Reddits.", "NTA, and please keep this insane person out of your life. I read your last post, anyone who is willing to cause you that level of grief to steal a beloved pet, and who weaponise their kids like that, should be avoided at all costs. She's the one who hurt her kids when she stole them a pet instead of shooting one of the literally millions looking for a home.\n\nI'm glad you got your cat back. Please make sure your sister doesn't have any way to access your home.", "OP call the police and file a report, you dont have to charge her, but you want evidence of this incase she trys something in the future - which she will do (does not seem like the type to just cut her loses).", "I remember your post from the other day. Did you get your cat chipped at the vet? That would be first thing on my priority list.", "Why do you need reassurance from Reddit it so badly? You know you aren\u2019t an arsehole.", "NTA", "But, but, but you don't understand! This one was probably already housebroken and trained and probably knew the girls too! How dare you expect her ( the sister) to get a new cat and spend her precious time on training and socialising her?! Don't you know she has other things to do?! / S obviously", "Especially if they wanted an adult cat.  Rescues will practically throw them at you.", "We recently adopted a cat for my nephew and there was literally no wait. We went back and chose out of maybe 20 and walked out the door with her 30 minutes later (she needed one shot). It was like $60. Stealing a cat is ridiculous.", "Right?! This is like the fourth post I\u2019ve seen about someone stealing a cat. I love cats-Like my goal in life is to be that crazy car lady- I get the appeal but why steal that specific cat?\n\nThere\u2019s likely hundreds of cats in your area desperately in need of a good home- why steal one that already has one?\n\nCats are awesome- all cats. They\u2019re all unique and all interesting and all have their own personalities. I saw someone say about training but literally all you need to do to train a kitty is put it in the litter box and move it\u2019s paws a bit.\n\nAnd socializing just get a little one and treat it well- it\u2019ll bond.\n\nI don\u2019t understand the cat theft. I get that her or her kids or whatever liked your cat but every cat is awesome- even the ones that are total assholes are still kinda impossible not to love.", "Because the point was not to get a cat, but to hurt her sister.", "The kids liked that cat, and she is one of the many parents who aren't able to tell their children no when they want something.", "Cats are not interchangable, OP's cat may be uncommonly loving and affectionate. It's not an excuse for stealing the cat.", "She\u2019s also abusive to animals. She shaved the cats face (?????) and put toxic paint on its body. I\u2019ve definitely cut people off for way less.", "Does your sister have a key to your house? If so, get your locks changed.", "It\u2019s also insane trying to defend herself by trying to minimize everything when she blamed the destruction of the relationship because of a cat instead of her actions. If you were to look at it the other way, the sister also risked throwing away the relationship with OP over a cat\u2026 and frankly possible lazy parenting because going to a shelter was harder than stealing OPs cat.", "I wonder if the cat shelters have previously rejected sister\u2019s adoption applications? Someone who would shave a cat\u2019s face and paint its claws with human polish does not seem like the best candidate.", "Definitely happy you got your cat back. Hope you changed all the locks in your place. Pretty sure she\u2019ll try her best to steal the cat back from you again. What a horrible thing to do", "Thank you for being a rescuer.", "If you message me I can send you some pictures of my baby :)", "I have a chip", "Cameras and a very secure door must also be needed for the OP.", "Stole your dog?!?! OHMYGOD! \nDo tell more please! \n\nI\u2019m just flabbergasted that there are such siblings. Were your parents still living? Dogs are very identifiable, vocal, and they go outside so the public sees you with them. WTF", "What the actual fuck. Also how did you do this? I'm so interested in your story now.", "I didnt know spiderman owned a dog.", "Cat tax!", "I don't recall the cat ever running around outside.  The sister fabricated the story that the cat got out while housesitting or something similar but had stolen the cat directly from the home.", "So, your sister is a psycho\u2026 Duly noted,", "In the first post OP says that her cat is afraid of going outside.", "Amen.  My first thought was \"I will burn your house down.  Once I get my cat.\"", "Yes!!!", "Me too!!!", "Advice. When it comes to dealing with other people over this. Family, etc, don't play up the nail polish thing. Yes it's a big deal, but most people won't care and it will muddy the waters when the very real issue is cut and dry.\n\nAside. I have lost a few cats (I am far older than you). Having their body for ashes and the little clay paw print thing is something that helps me. The mysterious lack of a body after the accident is a sign of BS.\n\nThere is something really wrong with your sister. Being a big sister goes two ways. If family means not shutting people out over a pet, then family certainly means not stealing pets. Yeah. No sane world would have ever need me to write that.\n\nGood luck. Thanks for the update.", "....How do you think the vet confirmed it was hers if not because it's already microchipped? Do you think perhaps she didn't specifically say they scanned the cat's chip because she thought that would be the logical conclusion as to why she brought the cat to the vet in the first place?", "Did you read the post? OP\u2019s cat is chipped. How does she suck???", "You\u2019re correct! No vet can look at it and go \u201cyup that\u2019s yours.\u201d The vet DID however scan for a chip, which the kitty already had, as OP has stated. Is there any other reason for op \u2018sucking\u2019 rather than your misunderstanding?", "Also WTF she told you your cat had died, how evil is that?", "Yeah like all the adult cats in shelters. I got a 1 year old cat from my shelter for free because they have trouble finding homes for them. Free! Just adult enough to be trained but still young enough to have a long life AND she was spayed, chipped and had her shots. For free.", "I mean... it doesn't take much to \"train\" a cat, that's not really a thing. Most cats you're gonna get- from a shelter, store, breeder, etc. are gonna be using a litterbox and at least somewhat socialized. \n\nMy guess is she liked the cat and decided she deserved them more than OP. Probably because she's a total lunatic.", "You don't actually housebreak a cat lol, they'll use a litterbox instinctively. Nor is there a socialization process, unless you're dealing with ferals. The only typical \"training\" involved is keeping cats from scratching furniture. So any ol' shelter cat would make do.", "Yeah, like a couple times a year the local shelter near me has a special adoption day, all animals that are 2+ years old are half price and senior animals are free.", " I don't get it either, I have two cats that were literally free. They just turned up in the garden one day and the owner couldn't be traced. Someone has actually been trying to lure one away from me. Get your own damn free cat!", "I went in a third story window and out the front door.", "I would change anyway. The way sister is, she may have a copy anyway.", "Yeah, cat whiskers are extremely sensitive and are how cats perceive balance and much of their depth perception.  Cutting them basically forces vertigo on your cat that lasts until the whiskers grow back.  It's not like trimming up a dog's muzzle or regular grooming.", "Thank you \ud83d\ude3a", "Good, she has no recourse! Stand firm and enjoy your little fur baby.", "Has your sister ever had a key to your home? Change the locks!!!!\n\n(Also - CAMERAS!!!!)", "I\u2019d file a police report too. And let your sister know. That should shut things down quickly.\n\nYour sister clearly doesn\u2019t respect you. But she may respect the police, if she is threatening you with them. It also establishes an official record, especially if accompanied by the veterinarian report.\n\nIt\u2019s the ultimate reverse-Uno", "I agree, I think it\u2019s an indoor kitty. The sister obviously fabricated the story about kitty running out and getting hit", "Still good advice for the future.", "Literally depends on the state on the burglary charge. Being let in when you know you don\u2019t have the residences permission is still trespassing. Doubt OP would face criminal charges for this because the sister would have to report it and then she would open herself up to theft charges for taking the cat in the first place. But sister seems crazy, so while OP is unlikely to get any convictions she could still make a mess of things", "logical and this thread dont mix. I do not assume anything that people dont post.", "Because she put the babysitter in a really bad position when she should have gone over and taken the cat back while the sister was there OR called the police/animal control over this.", "How she handled it basically. Rather then going over to talk with her sister and take the cat back. She went over when someone else was there and put them in a very bad spot.\n\nAnd there was nothing posted about her vet scanning for a chip when I posted on here.", "I got my cat free from a silly cat owner who didn't spay her calico, there's free kittens, and adult cats everywhere. I think this was something that gave her sister a thrill to hurt her by stealing her companion from her.", "Yup. Shelter I volunteered at gave black cats away round Halloween time. All cats get fixed as soon as they are old enough and chipped. \n\nSurplus of kittens in May? Free cats. Hoarding situation from the next state over? Free cats! Regular volunteer wants a cat? Free cat!", "This comment was stolen from u/HolleringCorgis further down thread.", "So you think it makes any kind of realistic sense that she walked into the vet's with her unchipped cat asking if it's hers, and instead of the vet being like \"we can't tell that if it isn't chipped, you'd know better than us\", the vet said \"yep that's definitely yours, I can tell just by looking at it\"? \n\nIf that's what you think, your first sentence is very correct.", "You\u2019re operating under the assumption that having a talk with her irrational sister would end up in her favor. Sister is unhinged and clearly not up to conversations about her lying and stealing OPs cat"]}
