The tickets may not have physically left your possession, but it is clear that at least one of those tickets was intended for her. Given that she\u2019s made plans for flights and everything, I feel like she should have the opportunity to go. At minimum you should let her buy her ticket off of you for the price that you paid, and maybe you can hike up the price of the other one so you can still get your profit.", "Damn that was aggressive", "She is not a student. She works full time. I need the money more than she needs the tickets. As previously stated I will reimburse her for the flight. Coldplay tickets btw.", "Yes, you are?

I personally think it's fair that one should be expected to honor financial commitments made even when broken up, if they cannot be cancelled/refunded.\n\nPeople don't make plans and decisions having the intention they'd be single or that they couldn't possibly break up with their SO. So since she booked a hotel and flight, which could easily be anywhere from $1000-4000, it's only fair to sell the tickets at the bought for value, as that is when she made the decision. \n\nI don't think she needs it's for free, if she can afford a hotel and flight for a ticket I would say it's reasonable she should be able to afford the ticket at it's original price", "if you have no hard feelings don\u2019t go fucking her over, at least sell her the ticket that would\u2019ve been hers for 100 if you insist on profiting from the second one that bad.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t have had the tickets if you hadn\u2019t of been with her anyways.", "Resale is close to $400 because of people scalping tickets.

Maybe he can give her a bit of a discount which is probably the best option but he doesn\u2019t owe her face value", "I wouldn't still expect a gift from my ex. She should pay him for the ticket if she wants it. Not triple or whatever it could cost now, but the price he paid. She isn't entilted to it.", "Now I do intend to scalp. But my initial intent was to go to the concert.", "She will survive if she doesn\u2019t go to the concert", "I think most people would take the profit", "Why can\u2019t you see why I bothered to post? I was curious about the opinions of others as all my friends have unanimously told me I\u2019m not an asshole.", "It\u2019s a technicality because he bought her a digital gift. He clearly bought it for her, or he never would have purchased it. So like I said, it\u2019s indisputably a gift imo. And it\u2019s tacky as hell to take it back. \n\nIt\u2019s even tackier to even think of selling them at a sky high price and fucking her over when the trip is already planned and paid. I\u2019m neutral on her buying them from him at the rate he bought them. I still think it\u2019s tacky, but \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "There are lots of things you can do that are more beneficial to you personally, and still make you an asshole. That\u2019s often how being an asshole works.", "Your original intent does not matter, especially since you choose to not go to the concert. \nSomeone you cared about was exited about an opportunity that was promised for months, but you made the choice to fuck them over on it knowing they have done nothing wrong and knowing how hurtful it would be. \n\nIn addition to that you broke one of the most fundamental rules of concert etiquette your intent doesn\u2019t change that you\u2019ve done that. there\u2019s a reason why everyone from the fans to the artists themselves hate scalping.", "Weird. I have positive upvotes and you're getting the ruling of asshole. Seems like the people are telling you, but you don't want to listen.", "Your friends are lying. Liars make poor friends...when you need them most, you'll find they ghost...", "Let\u2019s set aside for a second that he didn\u2019t buy them for her, he bought them as a couples outing \n\nIf I buy something for my SO in advance for Valentine\u2019s Day in January, leave it sitting in my car, and we break up on February 13th, I\u2019m not going to hit them up the next day and say \u201coh by the way here\u2019s your present\u201d just because I bought it when we were together.\n\nHe is selling it at market price, the tickets have appreciated in value so he can gain from that. They could have just as easily depreciated in value and he would lose out. He took the risk, the benefit/loss from that is what he gets \n\n>think it\u2019s tacky \n\nWhy would it be \u201ctacky\u201d to sell them to her at face value.  Why do you think she\u2019s entitled to free tickets from her ex?", "\u2018Am I the asshole?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes\u2019\n\n\u2018But - plot twist - what if my action benefits *me*?\u2019", "Selling concert tickets doesn\u2019t make you an asshole, expecting that you\u2019re entitled to not to pay value for concert tickets from your ex kind of would though", "Whatever dude", "No I have pretty good friends", "Okay, but that\u2019s not the case. They planned it together and have already paid for flights and probably a hotel. As I\u2019ve already explained like four times, I see it as a gift, and that\u2019s why I would just give it to her. He could have asked her to split the cost of tickets when they were purchased, but he didn\u2019t.. because it was a gift. \n\nA better example would be something that actually has happened to me. I bought my ex a skydiving experience for our anniversary, but we broke up a month before. He knew about it and was excited too. I still gave it to him. Also a digital receipt. I just emailed him the info. And I was also a broke college student at the time, so I don\u2019t really see that as an excuse. Morals and good character have no price.", "Dude you\u2019re on am I the asshole, if you can\u2019t accept getting told you\u2019re a total asshole and recognise that fact it\u2019s not the place for you.", "If you already knew you were fine backstabbing people for quick cash, why even bother posting here?", "I\u2019m side eyes needing the money.  If you had 200 bucks in the first place to blow on tickets, then it sounds like you just want to profit.", "Why are you even in here? You\u2019re clearly just going to argue with anyone that says YTA and sell the tickets anyway.", "True friends are honest. Yours.......not so much...", "It doesn\u2019t matter if they planned it together, it matters that he bought and owns the tickets \n\nAgain, just because you buy a gift for an occasion doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re entitled to it after you break up. If I buy a Valentine\u2019s Day gift and break up before Valentine\u2019s Day I\u2019m not going to give them that gift \n\nYour situation and this situation are not even the same because it was not a couples activity \n\nShe can buy it off him, but it\u2019s up to him how much he wants to charge for them. He\u2019s not being unreasonable and charging some exorbitant price, just whatever they\u2019re going for on the market \n\n>morals and good character have no price \n\nYou are objectively wrong on this part lol, they have a real price of whatever he paid for the ticket and an opportunity cost of whatever he could get for the ticket on the secondary market. Like there is an actual price point here", "Backstabbing? That\u2019s a bit harsh. She loses nothing physically. She broke up with me. I simply initiated the conversation.", "I bought them at the end of summer 2022 after two months of working when I had the money and before I was a student.", "How do you know?"]}
