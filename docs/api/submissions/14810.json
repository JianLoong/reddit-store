Given that she\u2019s made plans for flights and everything, I feel like she should have the opportunity to go. At minimum you should let her buy her ticket off of you for the price that you paid, and maybe you can hike up the price of the other one so you can still get your profit.", "Damn that was aggressive", "She is not a student.

I personally think it's fair that one should be expected to honor financial commitments made even when broken up, if they cannot be cancelled/refunded.\n\nPeople don't make plans and decisions having the intention they'd be single or that they couldn't possibly break up with their SO. So since she booked a hotel and flight, which could easily be anywhere from $1000-4000, it's only fair to sell the tickets at the bought for value, as that is when she made the decision. \n\nI don't think she needs it's for free, if she can afford a hotel and flight for a ticket I would say it's reasonable she should be able to afford the ticket at it's original price", "if you have no hard feelings don\u2019t go fucking her over, at least sell her the ticket that would\u2019ve been hers for 100 if you insist on profiting from the second one that bad.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t have had the tickets if you hadn\u2019t of been with her anyways.", "Resale is close to $400 because of people scalping tickets.
