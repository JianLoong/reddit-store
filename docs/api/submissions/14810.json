We paid for our own flights.", "It wasn\u2019t given though, she wasn\u2019t in possession of the ticket. It was still technically his.

It sounds like the question here is, \"Should I screw this person over in order to make money?\" And if the answer is yes, then YTA.", "That's fine I don't agree to disagree. You are an asshole.", "Yeah like, she looked forward to it. She bought plane tickets. She cant cancel them because it\u2019s not refundable. This is very mean to just ditch it", "But I will be out money if I just give them to her now. It has nothing to do with screwing her over. To clarify, the breakup wasn\u2019t me. It was mutual. I initiated the conversation and she broke it up. My bad for not clarifying.", "I don\u2019t think I am but let\u2019s be civilised. Agree to disagree!", "Honestly sell her the ticket for 100 bucks and resell your for market price. If she already booked a flight it\u2019s kinda a dick move.", "I mean, I'd defer to you to decide if you're taking this away from her based on something that was your doing or her doing. But if it's your decision that you two couldn't go to this concert together, then I'd still lean toward allowing her to use the ticket you bought for her. If you bought it for her, you made the decision to spend that money. The fact that you now have an opportunity to go back on that doesn't mean you should. \n\nI assume this is a seated concert and you can't both go and not be near each other?\n\nAlso, it seems like you could just sell your ticket and you wouldn't be down any money, if you don't want to go with her.", "So sell her the tickets at the value you bought them for, then you won't be out. Or sell her one at that value and sell the other at the current price. Or give her one, sell the other at the current price, and you'd still be up..I'm getting the vibe that you want to justify selling them to make money, regardless of what happens to the plans she made based on your gift, which would make YTA.", "You came to ask if people thought your were an asshole. I'm telling you I think you are an asshole. Every time you argue it, it makes you more of an asshole.\n\nNo one is stopping you from scalping your tickets for a profit. It's probably not going to keep you up at night if you do. Just don't get upset for being judged on a sub who's purpose is to judge assholes.", "I think regardless I\u2019m gonna sell them for the profit. I\u2019m a student and need the money.
