She\u2019s mixed race (I\u2019m black, my ex is white). Because of this, Brooke has always had trouble with styling her hair, so she kept it fairly short. \n\nA couple years ago I heard about the curly girl method, and since using some of those principles, Brooke was able to get her hair to be styled properly and make it look good, so she\u2019s grown it out since then.\n\nI don\u2019t feel comfortable posting pictures of her on an anonymous site like this, but for an idea of how it looks style and length wise, here is a [reference picture](https://www.reddit.com/user/Alternative_Solid815/comments/137ual8/reference_picture_not_brooke_but_very_similar/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1) I found on google that has very similar hair to Brooke. \n\nShe puts a lot of work in to get this end result, and while it does require a lot of product and time, I am okay with that. My ex, however, doesn\u2019t want to spend the money on hair care products so when she is at his house, she just doesn\u2019t use them. \n\nThat was fine, because he only has her on alternating weekends, but I recently went on a vacation with some friends and she stayed with him for 2 weeks. \n\nNearing the end of the 2 weeks, he texted me and asked for permission to cut her hair short. I was confused, because she never indicated wanting to do that, so I asked him why. \n\nHe said that her hair looked awful and she was refusing to take care of it, wash it, or use any products in it. That also struck me as very odd, so I asked what products he meant and he sent me a picture of some cheap crappy Walmart shampoo and hair gel. He said he made her brush it, but it just looked even worse. \n\nI told him that he was an idiot. The cheap walmart hair crap just fries her hair, hair gel doesn\u2019t work with her hair, and of course it looked bad when she brushed it, that\u2019s what happens when you brush curly hair. I gave him a list of the products she uses and told him to go to buy them so she can take care of her hair, but he refused, saying they were way too expensive and that he wanted to have her hair cut short because \u201cclearly that\u2019s the only length she can handle.\u201d\n\nHe made a facebook post about how I was enabling my daughter to \u201clook like a bum\u201d and not letting him \u201cfix the problem\u201d. A lot of his family and some of my family that still keep in touch with him told me that I needed to accept that she is his daughter too and he gets a say in things. \n\nI\u2019m sticking by my choice and I\u2019m not going to let him cut Brooke\u2019s hair off unless she tells me that\u2019s what she wants to do. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683223209, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137uv9m/aita_for_not_allowing_my_ex_husband_to_cut_our/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t know the answer, but this one fits.", "She can, but doesn\u2019t want to hurt or upset her mom probably. Also, apparently had no way to purchase products so how would she get the haircut?", "Your assumption is in saying that's the most likely reason as opposed to multiple other possible reasons: daughter doesn't care about looking a mess for 2 weeks, daughter doesn't want to bring it up because OP gets mad about discussions of her ex, daughter just forgot, daughter assumed she would just put her hair in a protective style for the 2 weeks but for some reason dad is not okay with that, daughter has reason to think her things won't be respected at her dad's house so she leaves important things with her mom", "> Mom is pushing it.\n\nThere was no \"probably\" on this assumption.", "You have to judge based on the information given. You don't get to just make up whatever you want.", "The girl is 16. There is no need for either parent to be so involved in her hair care, yet we don\u2019t get a clue of her perspective except that *she* previously kept her hair short. That indicates that only choice we know she has made was to keep it short. Mom convinced her to let it grow and did all the legwork and funding for the endeavor, so clearly the daughter just went along with it.", "Read the post carefully. The daughter\u2019s opinion is suspiciously absent. Mom\u2019s pushiness is not.", "I judged using the information given.", "And OP said SHE has grown it out since then:\n\n>so she\u2019s grown it out since then\n\nThat's implying a choice too, it's just one you decided to ignore it for your assumptions.", "I'm fully aware the daughters opinion is absent. I literally mentioned it to you in another comment.", "No, you speculated about \"what probably happened\" with no evidence at all.", "No one else could grow it out. It\u2019s her hair.", "Hence it\u2019s probable that mom is pushing longer hair than the daughter wants to bother with.", "There is evidence. You are free to disagree and imagine unknown other reasons could exist."]}
