She\u2019s mixed race (I\u2019m black, my ex is white). Because of this, Brooke has always had trouble with styling her hair, so she kept it fairly short. \n\nA couple years ago I heard about the curly girl method, and since using some of those principles, Brooke was able to get her hair to be styled properly and make it look good, so she\u2019s grown it out since then.\n\nI don\u2019t feel comfortable posting pictures of her on an anonymous site like this, but for an idea of how it looks style and length wise, here is a [reference picture](https://www.reddit.com/user/Alternative_Solid815/comments/137ual8/reference_picture_not_brooke_but_very_similar/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1) I found on google that has very similar hair to Brooke. \n\nShe puts a lot of work in to get this end result, and while it does require a lot of product and time, I am okay with that. My ex, however, doesn\u2019t want to spend the money on hair care products so when she is at his house, she just doesn\u2019t use them. \n\nThat was fine, because he only has her on alternating weekends, but I recently went on a vacation with some friends and she stayed with him for 2 weeks. \n\nNearing the end of the 2 weeks, he texted me and asked for permission to cut her hair short. I was confused, because she never indicated wanting to do that, so I asked him why. \n\nHe said that her hair looked awful and she was refusing to take care of it, wash it, or use any products in it. That also struck me as very odd, so I asked what products he meant and he sent me a picture of some cheap crappy Walmart shampoo and hair gel. He said he made her brush it, but it just looked even worse. \n\nI told him that he was an idiot. The cheap walmart hair crap just fries her hair, hair gel doesn\u2019t work with her hair, and of course it looked bad when she brushed it, that\u2019s what happens when you brush curly hair. I gave him a list of the products she uses and told him to go to buy them so she can take care of her hair, but he refused, saying they were way too expensive and that he wanted to have her hair cut short because \u201cclearly that\u2019s the only length she can handle.\u201d\n\nHe made a facebook post about how I was enabling my daughter to \u201clook like a bum\u201d and not letting him \u201cfix the problem\u201d. A lot of his family and some of my family that still keep in touch with him told me that I needed to accept that she is his daughter too and he gets a say in things. \n\nI\u2019m sticking by my choice and I\u2019m not going to let him cut Brooke\u2019s hair off unless she tells me that\u2019s what she wants to do. \n\nAITA?\n\nEditing to add, it seems I didn\u2019t do a great job of explaining that Brooke doesn\u2019t want to cut her hair, and I\u2019m defending her, not saying she has to keep it. If she wanted to cut it, she could, but it\u2019s my ex who wants to.", "created_utc": 1683223209, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137uv9m/aita_for_not_allowing_my_ex_husband_to_cut_our/", "score": 2658, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her hair is fine the way it is. But our society demands that women, especially women of color, perform aesthetic labor to be accepted. And the beauty standards in white dominated societies led many black women to use relaxers that have dramatically increased rates of cancer in the black community. This shit is important.", "Honestly this sounds like dad being a bit racist. It's pretty common for white people to be overly-judgemental of black hair, and the comments about her looking like a bum fall well in-line with what is normally said about black hair styles (unprofessional, etc).
