She\u2019s mixed race (I\u2019m black, my ex is white). Because of this, Brooke has always had trouble with styling her hair, so she kept it fairly short. \n\nA couple years ago I heard about the curly girl method, and since using some of those principles, Brooke was able to get her hair to be styled properly and make it look good, so she\u2019s grown it out since then.\n\nI don\u2019t feel comfortable posting pictures of her on an anonymous site like this, but for an idea of how it looks style and length wise, here is a [reference picture](https://www.reddit.com/user/Alternative_Solid815/comments/137ual8/reference_picture_not_brooke_but_very_similar/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1) I found on google that has very similar hair to Brooke. \n\nShe puts a lot of work in to get this end result, and while it does require a lot of product and time, I am okay with that. My ex, however, doesn\u2019t want to spend the money on hair care products so when she is at his house, she just doesn\u2019t use them. \n\nThat was fine, because he only has her on alternating weekends, but I recently went on a vacation with some friends and she stayed with him for 2 weeks. \n\nNearing the end of the 2 weeks, he texted me and asked for permission to cut her hair short. I was confused, because she never indicated wanting to do that, so I asked him why. \n\nHe said that her hair looked awful and she was refusing to take care of it, wash it, or use any products in it. That also struck me as very odd, so I asked what products he meant and he sent me a picture of some cheap crappy Walmart shampoo and hair gel. He said he made her brush it, but it just looked even worse. \n\nI told him that he was an idiot. The cheap walmart hair crap just fries her hair, hair gel doesn\u2019t work with her hair, and of course it looked bad when she brushed it, that\u2019s what happens when you brush curly hair. I gave him a list of the products she uses and told him to go to buy them so she can take care of her hair, but he refused, saying they were way too expensive and that he wanted to have her hair cut short because \u201cclearly that\u2019s the only length she can handle.\u201d\n\nHe made a facebook post about how I was enabling my daughter to \u201clook like a bum\u201d and not letting him \u201cfix the problem\u201d. A lot of his family and some of my family that still keep in touch with him told me that I needed to accept that she is his daughter too and he gets a say in things. \n\nI\u2019m sticking by my choice and I\u2019m not going to let him cut Brooke\u2019s hair off unless she tells me that\u2019s what she wants to do. \n\nAITA?\n\nEditing to add, it seems I didn\u2019t do a great job of explaining that Brooke doesn\u2019t want to cut her hair, and I\u2019m defending her, not saying she has to keep it. If she wanted to cut it, she could, but it\u2019s my ex who wants to.", "created_utc": 1683223209, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137uv9m/aita_for_not_allowing_my_ex_husband_to_cut_our/", "score": 443, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You bring up medication in another comment- if your child forgot their meds you\u2019d either drive to get them back, or order more from the pharmacy. OP\u2019s NTA, stop blaming them for their ex\u2019s laziness.", "I mean, she\u2019s 16 and she forgot. She probably won\u2019t forget again.", "Okay, relax.\n\nThis commenter is blaming mom for not packing her hair products. I'm simply stating that at 16yrs old, it's not your mom's responsibility anymore.\n\nNo one is stating they're perfect with a perfect memory.", "At 16 you can also call your mom and ask her to venmo you $20 so you can get hair products that you forgot to pack\u2026 if they\u2019re products she uses regularly she can bring them home to her moms house and not waste them \n\nAlso there are relatively cheap CGM products (I started with a huge bottle of a Suave conditioner when I started CGM because I had longer hair and my hair is dense and I had a sense I would be using a LOT of product). I bet there\u2019s a few CGM products available at Walmart. But yeah this problem seems very fixable", "She forgot. Hell I do CGM and I\u2019ve forgotten and bought hair products in another city. If he doesn\u2019t wanna fork over the cash, he can get his ass in the car and drive 30 min to OPs house to pick them up - it\u2019ll cost less and take less time than this phone call, Facebook post and potential teen haircut against their will.", "Aaand again. She forgot. Because she doesn\u2019t usually need to bring it to her dad\u2019s house. As someone with curly hair, she may not even need these products every day.", "There was that post yesterday I think where the daughter cut her brother's hair as a \"prank\" and her mother forced her to get her own hair cut to a similar length as punishment. While I agree that she deserved it, I was kinda surprised the hair dresser was willing to go along with that.", "At 16, most courts will heavily take into account the child wishes.", "Reddit is full of social mutants.", "I\u2019m sorry but have you BEEN on this sub? I am at a point to expect the WORST out of people. Isn\u2019t it sadder that we should be relieved he is a lazy and selfish parent? Ffs.", "Or dad coulda driven her back to pick the stuff up. I assume she has a key at 16yo", "Just found out that OP does allow her to bring them.   Brooke forgot the products on accident!", "But if he still wouldn\u2019t do it without her being on board, how is he an asshole?", "But then she can just say no and move on.", "Ah, so it really is just dad making a mountain out of a molehill and Brooke is more or less fine? Good to know.", "Here's the simple solution although kind of pricey.  The next time Brooke goes to her dads order her a small set of the stuff she needs and ship it directly to his house.  You could also buy a toiletry caddy like college students use when they live in the dorms.", "Why is he so obsessed with her hair?... I'm also a black woman and I'm side-eying TF out of this man. My dad **never** tried to control what I did with my hair - ever. Why is he so desperate to control that aspect of her appearance - to the point where he is trying to win over some randos on social media whose opinion doesn't matter **at all**. \n\nI really suspect that if your daughter had straight hair he wouldn't be so obsessed with trying to cut it or make it fit into his little box of what he deems acceptable. Also, she is 16. Not a child.\n\nYou know what I'm thinking OP.... We all are....", "This is concerning. \n\n2 weeks without washing your hair and it's not an issue ? \n\nShe's 16. She can take the bus.", "more natural ones do yeah", "OH, Dad is most definitely the AH in this. No question! And cutting Brooke's hair should NEVER have been considered!!!\n\nI just think it is a reasonable expectation that when going someplace for 2 weeks, you should bring any special products you use with you. Mistakes happen.", "I wrote this before the other comment!", "\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t stop her, but would you embrace it? And if so, does she know that? Or does she think you prefer it this way and that\u2019s why you\u2019ve gotten the products and researched and everything? She may be incorrectly assuming you\u2019d be upset.\u201d\n\nI am fine with whatever she wants to do with her hair. She makes her own choices about these kinds of things. \n\n\u201cHave you not talked to her since the contact from her father?\u201d I called her after making the post.", "In theory\u2026yes\u2026but they often want *reasons*. And if your reasons are shampoo\u2026they may disregard them.", "If you're developing misanthropy over AITA you may want to step away from it. You're only ever going to see rough cases here, nobody is here to shower people in their life in praise.", "I just said the same thing.", "Dammit Brooke!", "I don\u2019t entirely know if he would or wouldn\u2019t do it if I said it was ok. He\u2019s aware that at 16, she gets some say in custody arrangements and doing something like that would be a quick case. However if I also agreed to it then he can\u2019t be blamed. \n\nId like to think that he wouldn\u2019t, but I can\u2019t actually guarantee that.", "Buddy, give up. You\u2019re making assumptions left and right, which are completely unfounded.\n\nNTA, OP. Keep defending your daughter!", "2 weeks without a clarifying wash is not concerning for biracial hair. it's not ideal either (hence the slight frizz and grease) but it's not like she's not bathing for 2 weeks at a time.", "She\u2019s mixed race, so her hair will be fine especially if it\u2019s a coarse and curly texture. I\u2019m fully black and wash my hair every week or two and it\u2019s fine", "No it\u2019s not for people with certain hair types.", "Different hair textures have very different hair procedures. I cannot speak to it because my hair is straight, but as far as I know, washing very curly hair is a heavy process, and it does not need to be done nearly as often in comparison to straight hair. Some people even wear caps to protect their hair in the shower. \n\nIf she cares that much about her hair that she usually spends a bunch of time on it, I'm sure she if she says it's okay, it is.", "Curly hair is different that straight hair, and the advice for this is to wash it much less often that straight hair. \n\nI'm white with really fine 3a curls- so my hair is less curly and my wash schedule is around every 10-ish days. I could do a fortnight or a bit longer but that would be pushing it. At least  refresh which is basically where you wet it an restyle would be needed to maintain the defined curls for this time though. \n\nTo do a refresh does require styling products, thought and as she hasn't got any with her its why the hair is appearing frizzy. \n\nCurly hair washed are then to be a lot more work- my hairdresser who specialises in curly hair has said that I get off light as my hair is fine, and my hair is a similar length shown so not super long, but a wash and condition with deranging prob takes me 20 mins, with about another 10 to style, and then 20 to diffuse (or a couple of hours to air dry if I'm being lazy). I'm also not 100% on the curly girl method and also don't do any additional defining steps eg root clips, finger curls, dennman bush if it did this would be another 30 mins at least!", "It doesn't mean she's not showering! I have naturally curly hair, and I can't shampoo every day without it becoming a nightmare, but I absolutely shower and condition daily.", "You clearly know nothing about biracial/black hair, so maybe you should sit this one out......", "Oh, that makes sense. I have generic white girl hair and I'm cheap, so I take advantage of being able to just use the kind of shampoo the dad bought.", "Look, if you zoom far enough into any disagreement, it will look silly. If the court asks for reasons, they will get legitimate reasons. The girl doesn't feel supported by her father, that he forces her to use substandard products, and then expresses frustration when they fail and he wants to alter her appearance against her wishes so he doesn't have to work as hard. \n\nThat sounds pretty terrible to me when it's typed out.\n\nSpeaking as a child of divorced parents who split his time between them, this guy is taking a risky path. Alienating your child when they are just coming into adulthood is the kind of move that is incredibly hard to undo.", "But you didn\u2019t feel inclined to agree, so nothing to worry about.", "They aren\u2019t.", "And her dad should remind her that when it comes to her own bodily autonomy, her feelings are way more important than those of other people. Her mom will (or should) understand that and if not, then dad can argue with her behind the scenes. \n\nYou are assuming that she couldn't get the products when it's entirely possible it was sheer teenage laziness. Also, dad is apparently willing to get her a haircut so even if she has no job or allowance or other access to money, he would give her enough for the haircut.", "He understandably doesn\u2019t want her to look like a hobo or whatever his complaint was. Of course her hair should be up to her and if she\u2019s satisfied with whatever it looks like, they should accept that, but they\u2019re not wrong to have opinions.", "If he wants her to take care of her hair, he is welcome to get products she will actually use. And blasting your kid and ex on social media is way more than \"having opinions\". It's being a shitty dad and coparent.", "If she\u2019s following the curly girl method then using the wrong products can set back the progress she\u2019s made at getting her hair to look good, which will be why Brooke is refusing to use them.", "I agree that the social media post is bad, but that wasn\u2019t the question."]}
