Her fault.\n\nIf flights weren't comparably different, then you OP are hung up on the drive time irrationally, could have explained your absence to the volunteer organization, and assisted on this occasion. I understand that equine therapy has a minimum need of volunteers to ensure everyone can participate, but it's a VOLUNTEER situation. You would not have been written up, terminated, or otherwise reprimanded, and they would have 100% understood, with the proper communication that you had a one-off situation to attend to.\n\nSounds to me like you don't like your SIL, didn't want to spend the drive time alone with her, and now you're hoping the internet will echo-chamber rationalizing your cowardly flight response.", "NTA.

One really close to us and one an hour and a half each way away. (we also have Portland and that's even farther away, cheaper but way too far). The difference in price between out two airports means that it's a lot cheaper to fly into the one that is an hour and a half away...so the same distance you're talking.\n\nYou volunteer every week. Equine therapy is amazing. I don't take it that your SIL comes into town often. It's not like your wife had a choice not to show up for the emergency.\n\nDid you even try to call where you volunteer?\n\nYou're wife is not an AH.\n\nI'm trying to decide if you are.\n\nIf she flew her in to the other airport for savings. You blew that out of the water.\n\nI know people that avoid the Portland airport like the plague. They hate driving in Portland.\n\nIt just seems like you added extra stress to your wife. Was this worth it to you to prove you were right?\n\nThere are always moments in a marriage when we can choose not to be AHs.\n\nWhat did you choose?", "YTA and everyone saying your not is forgetting this is sub is not about being right but about being an AH. Yes, it was an AH move not to pick your sil up, leaving her stuck at the airport due to things out of her control (wife chose the airport, wife having to work) yes, not helping your wife out when she got called unexpectedly into work is an AH move. Marriage is a partnership, you HELP each other when needed, not flat out refuse to prove a point", "Wait a minute - my vulcan half is having a discussion with my human half about the logic of a person who works in medicine expecting to get away from work when their work life is prone to being disrupted by emergencies at any time and still scheduling a trip to the airport based on what they HOPE might happen.  \n\nVulcan wins again.  Assuming wife knows your schedule, her first mistake was having her sister fly in on the same day you would be unavailable if something went wrong.  Her second mistake was scheduling sister into the more distant airport because 'she' likes the drive better instead of flying her into the closer airport in case something came up for her at work.  Her third mistake was assuming you would blow off your commitment when she was detained at work.  So the verdict is in - NTA.

It's her sister so she has to deal with her in the first place.\nGetting someone from the airport is not a life or death emergency, it's no emergency at all. \n\nShe should pay her sister a taxi or an Uber, but definitely not expecting that her husband should drop his commitments?\n\nOP is NTA here.", "Why are OP\u2019s wife\u2019s responsibilities more important than OP\u2019s responsibilities?
