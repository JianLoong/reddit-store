No one, except evidently your wife, wants to drive 3 hours round trip to the airport (not to mention dealing with the possibility of delays). I honestly don\u2019t get the logic of this decision at all because as the sister I would be annoyed to have to get in a car for 1.5 hours after a flight if there was an option that was only a 45 minute drive. Uber is definitely the right option.", "If you and your wife share finances then you and your wife just paid a few hundred dollars for an uber.\n\nETA: I'd be mad either way, you told her to use the closer airport.

If you missed a shift, there is a chance someone would miss therapy that week. To make the choice for an airport 1.5 hours away is at total AH move.
