They had the house for years and could have taken responsibility for their debt by paying or making arrangements to do so. Instead, they passed on the house to the next person to bear the burden.

They made mistakes that led to consequences for you. They made problems for you. You cleaned up their mess and they still feel entitled to something?!? Laughable. You\u2019re the only one with some sense. Congratulations on 30k. Sorry for your home being lost. However if it\u2019s a foreclosure under your mom\u2019s and sister\u2019s name you should be able to put in a bid on it. If you have a 700 credit score plus enough for 10% down you could buy it under your name. Since it is a foreclosure I\u2019m sure you could get a good price as well .", "There are so many layers to your families issues. NTA but decide whether you want to counter-sue, limit contact or both.", "YTA. Your mother sold the house to your sister in 2019. You didn't own it. Unless your sister sold the house to you and you just didn't mention that in your post, you had no legal right to sell the house and no legal right to keep the money.\n\nYour mother didn't own it. She sold the house to your sister. So she has no business asking for $11k.\n\nYour sister, as the property owner, is entitled to at least a share of the money, possibly all of it.\n\n> Lawyers advised I could counter-sue for the entire $56k debt.\n\nUnless you paid off $56k of debt out of your own pockets, no, you can't. Assuming the outstanding debt was paid off from the proceeds of selling the house, you have no grounds for suing your mom or your sister.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Nobody paid any of their debt that accumulated on the house. Then it was given to me without any knowledge of the debt. However I did renovated the house and paid my share of taxes and HOA fees. Then the stranger came looking for them. Because the HOA was suing them for not doing as agreed. Which was before my time with the house. I did have full right to sell the house.", "And I\u2019m not trying to sue them.

Mom and sister can certainly ask you for money but have no right to demand any.\n\nIf your mom wanted $11k, she needed to ask you for money before deeding the house to you.\n\nYou still have no basis for counter-suing, though.
