I live with 2 other girls but I've never given much thought to how I dress around them because in my opinion, when you're in your own home, comfort is more important than looking presentable or modest. \n\nSometimes, one of my roommates will have a guy she's seeing over. Again, I don't pay much attention to what I'm wearing when he's around. If I need to use the kitchen while they are in there, I don't put on trousers to do so. I just go about my business like I normally would (whilst obviously saying hello and being polite, etc). \n\nMost of the time, my roommate would tell me \"just to let you know, [insert guy's name] is coming over soon\". I thought she'd tell me this because she was being a considerate roommate. So I'd just say OK, thanks for letting me know. \n\nToday, she admitted to me that the reason why she notifies me whenever the guy is coming over is to give me a chance to put on trousers beforehand. At first, I thought she was just poking fun at my clothing habits, so I laughed it off. Then she starts saying \"don't you feel uncomfortable?\". At this point, I feel a bit judged, and I tell her no, I don't feel uncomfortable wearing what I like in my own home. Then she says something along the lines of \"but it's kind of common decency to not be half dressed when people are over\".\n\nI was pissed but tried to stay calm. I reiterated that I will dress how I like because I pay rent here and it's not like I'm indecently exposing myself to anyone. I then left the room to cool down.\n\nI haven't had another discussion with my roommate about it since. In my opinion, it is not my responsibility to make her or her guy friend feel comfortable. If I had my breasts or genitalia on display, that would be another story. Or if I was purposefully showing flesh to try to get the guy's attention, that would be wrong. But I'm literally just existing in the way I usually do. At the same time, I understand people have different ideas about modesty and what is appropriate behaviour around house guests, particularly those of the opposite gender. So I'm wondering if I could be considered an asshole.\n\nEDIT: I wear XL t shirts which cover my underwear. I get them large so they are more like a nightie. It is similar to wearing a short dress.

How dressed is up for debate, but it\u2019s probably safe to say more than just a t- shirt. I would say you definitely don\u2019t need to be wearing street clothes or even necessarily a bra. However, the expectation of pajama shorts is pretty reasonable and you will still be comfortable. Unless your baggy T-shirt is more like a dress and coming down like mid thigh.

Clearly a lot of people here think that her request is reasonable. But, unlike them, I don't think you're obligated to do as she requests. Her boyfriend is not your guest. You aren't obligated to put more clothes on to make him feel welcome.

So a chat should happen. However I am in the idea of I live here and pay the rent and utilities, I'm not going to make myself uncomfortable.

And half the commenters actually defended him for some reason, as did the boyfriend.", "Ah, but the guy KNOWS it\u2019s for sleeping, and it\u2019s REALLY *just a short*. Therefore obviously it\u2019s risqu\u00e9, and he cannot keep his mind off her, and on his actual gf, and it\u2019s not at all his fault!  He is a man and therefore must stare. He can\u2019t help it.   /s", "It's still a request from their roommate and OP should respect where they're thinking is coming from and maybe even go with it. I wonder if she greets her own guests in the same outfit.", "In the world I live in, people wear pants when they are around others. It's a pretty solid social norm and not that hard to adhere to if you want to get along with the people you live with.", "Yeah, because then there was a guest in the house", "I actually encourage my wife to prance around in her underwear when I have friends over. Only a misogynist, narcissistic, asshole would try to police what a woman wears, and then gaslight her about social mores. And when my guy friends express their discomfort, I put them on blast on social media, so that other women know they are predators.", "I was answering a question.\n\n>Of course what\u2019s appropriate in front of family at home isn\u2019t necessarily appropriate for mixed company in a shared home.\n\nNice to know you agree then that his question was irrelevant.\n\nIf I said \"I wouldn't dress like that around my family\", you would call me a hypocrite. And when I say \"actually I do dress like that\", you go \"of course the situations are different!\". This is laughable.", "Probably because we disagree with you in general. That\u2019s how it is on Reddit", "Then her roommate and dates wouldn\u2019t know she didn\u2019t have on shorts underneath. If they can tell she just has on underwear, she isn\u2019t covering like she thinks she is", "Is it \"normal\" to dress that way when your male coworker comes over? How about your teacher? A business contact?\n\nYou must know that there are situations where you have to be more modest, right?", "Yeah, for sure.", "Then how does everyone know she isn\u2019t wearing shorts underneath? If they know, it\u2019s because she isn\u2019t covering as well as she thinks. Especially if she is going into the kitchen and reaching into cabinets or raising her arms above her head at all", "I mean even a mid thigh dress you can\u2019t just move around freely you need to pose and angle your legs and arms to avoid flashing people.", "the person uncomfortable is the roomate. \n\nand it's her home as well. \n\nand if you missed that you need to take human communications 101. \n\nalso this reeks of sexism. \n\nIf a man was going around in boxers making female guests of his roommate uncomfortable no one would be defending OP. \n\nBut since she's a woman, he should just get over feeling uncomfortable. \n\nJesus it's like the part of the human brain that makes us social animals didn't form in some people.", "Knowing this sub's boner for prioritizing individualism at the expense of human decency, I was expecting the response here to similarly defend OP.", "I need this link \ud83d\ude02 what alternate reality was this", "Good for you for posting on here to gain perspective and not just for justification. And, just to be clear, I mean that genuinely. \n\nThe issue here doesn't even seem to be whether or not you are willing to put on trousers, but the delivery. Your roommate might be taking you not wearing trousers on around her guy friends in a way you never intended, just like you might be taking her comment in a way she never intended. Express your feelings and allow her the space to express hers. Let her know that more direct conversation is better for you and let her know that you aren't uncomfortable but also don't want to make her uncomfortable, if that's the situation.", "OP, you should consider buying shirt dresses. It won't take away your comfort, and it looks very decent that you can wear them outside. Hope y'all work this out!!", "like I said , I hope your male friends parade around in their underwear around your gf/bf/wife", "What a weirdo.", "This. It's evident OP and roommates may not have set boundaries before or assumed certain things were understood or \"common practice.\" Clarifying expectations in common areas, including for how potential future issues should be brought up, sounds like a good idea.", "Thank you! If the tshirt was long enough it never slipped it wouldn\u2019t be an issue. Clearly it has and that\u2019s why the roomate is embarrassed.", "Exactly! I absolutely get the \u201caren\u2019t you uncomfortable\u201d question not out of \u201cmorality\u201d but because like?

It drives me nuts. \n\nThat and the argument, \"You have a legal right to (treat people horribly)\" when this isn't the *AM I WITHIN MY LEGAL RIGHTS TO BE AN ASSHOLE* sub.

For the record, I don\u2019t allow penises in my house. They\u2019re triggering and ableist. Do better.", "That\u2019s exactly it. And why it\u2019s not adding up for me. Unless that tshirt is below her knees or at best past mid thigh then she is definitely flashing people because no one could ever without thought avoid doing that in a dress or skirt. I know I haven\u2019t ever been able to do it. And at that point I would find it a moral issue because she either doesn\u2019t care if others are uncomfortable or kind of enjoys it. Both are bad. Especially because at that point she\u2019s clearly not physically comfortable if she\u2019s putting in thought to not flash.", "But I doubt people would be reacting the same way if it *was* a dress.", "You just said you let your wife walk around in her underwear around your \u201cguy friends\u201d.

If it\u2019s a medium knee length dress then I could maybe get away without thinking about it. But with anything above the knee damn straight I need to be aware. \n\nAnd specifically I\u2019m more talking about bending down to get a pot in the kitchen or reaching for something on a shelf or if I want to sit down needing to keep my legs together or crossed. If the dress is mid thigh I have to pay attention to the fact that it could ride up. And if I\u2019m lounging around not paying attention and wearing a mid to short dress then chances are I could flash someone. \n\nAnd if you can do all of that in a short dress then my friend you should buy some lottery tickets because I don\u2019t know a single woman in my life who doesn\u2019t have to be adjusting when wearing anything that\u2019s mid thigh or above.", "Big difference between a t-shirt and a dress is you can unintentionally flash somebody just by lifting your arms when wearing just a t-shirt.
