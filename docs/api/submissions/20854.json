I live with 2 other girls but I've never given much thought to how I dress around them because in my opinion, when you're in your own home, comfort is more important than looking presentable or modest. \n\nSometimes, one of my roommates will have a guy she's seeing over. Again, I don't pay much attention to what I'm wearing when he's around. If I need to use the kitchen while they are in there, I don't put on trousers to do so. I just go about my business like I normally would (whilst obviously saying hello and being polite, etc). \n\nMost of the time, my roommate would tell me \"just to let you know, [insert guy's name] is coming over soon\". I thought she'd tell me this because she was being a considerate roommate. So I'd just say OK, thanks for letting me know. \n\nToday, she admitted to me that the reason why she notifies me whenever the guy is coming over is to give me a chance to put on trousers beforehand. At first, I thought she was just poking fun at my clothing habits, so I laughed it off. Then she starts saying \"don't you feel uncomfortable?\". At this point, I feel a bit judged, and I tell her no, I don't feel uncomfortable wearing what I like in my own home. Then she says something along the lines of \"but it's kind of common decency to not be half dressed when people are over\".\n\nI was pissed but tried to stay calm. I reiterated that I will dress how I like because I pay rent here and it's not like I'm indecently exposing myself to anyone. I then left the room to cool down.\n\nI haven't had another discussion with my roommate about it since. In my opinion, it is not my responsibility to make her or her guy friend feel comfortable. If I had my breasts or genitalia on display, that would be another story. Or if I was purposefully showing flesh to try to get the guy's attention, that would be wrong. But I'm literally just existing in the way I usually do. At the same time, I understand people have different ideas about modesty and what is appropriate behaviour around house guests, particularly those of the opposite gender. So I'm wondering if I could be considered an asshole.\n\nEDIT: I wear XL t shirts which cover my underwear. I get them large so they are more like a nightie. It is similar to wearing a short dress.

How dressed is up for debate, but it\u2019s probably safe to say more than just a t- shirt. I would say you definitely don\u2019t need to be wearing street clothes or even necessarily a bra. However, the expectation of pajama shorts is pretty reasonable and you will still be comfortable. Unless your baggy T-shirt is more like a dress and coming down like mid thigh.

Your choice of attire embarrasses your roommate. She has the right to express how she feels and ask you to wear more clothing in shared parts of the apartment.

Clearly a lot of people here think that her request is reasonable. But, unlike them, I don't think you're obligated to do as she requests. Her boyfriend is not your guest. You aren't obligated to put more clothes on to make him feel welcome. But you need to understand that not going along with her request will strain your relationship even more than you already have.\n\nI know men who will go outside to pick up a newspaper or fetch their mail wearing only boxer shorts -- no shirt and no trousers.

So a chat should happen. However I am in the idea of I live here and pay the rent and utilities, I'm not going to make myself uncomfortable.

Just put some shorts on till they're gone.", "YTA\nAs someone who is sans pants once I walk in the door, I get wanting to be comfortable, but I'm also not living with roommates.

You were being indecent, and inconsiderate of your roommate, who should also feel comfortable in their own space that they pay rent for.

I doubt you communicated this with them ahead of time. This isn't a debate about which direction to place the toilet paper roll. This is about human decency and respecting others\u2019 comfort levels.

Put on some pants ffs", "YTA - put on a pair of shorts my dude. I get it. I love the whole baggy t shirt and just undies style. I wear it all the time in my own home.

You need to not just think about how you feel but consider you are infringing on other people who have a right to the same space you do.\n\nEdit 2:  I just thought of this. OP do you dress like this with your own guests. Or just your roommates guests?", "absolutely this. her rights and boundaries are not being disrespected. put on some fucking pajama pants or shorts! and if getting dressed in a top and bottoms like a normal adult is too heinous, then just stay in your room where you have every right to dress and act however you see fit.", "yeah, part of having roommates is that sometimes one of you will have guests and therefore you will have to go from \u201calone in my own space\u201d mode to \u201ccompany is over\u201d mode. it\u2019s basic common decency", ">\nShe's being respectful and telling you when he's coming over.\n\nI'm listening, but from my point of view, my roommate wasn't being respectful because her intention of telling me she was having a guy round was to hint that I should put on trousers. If she outright told me it was making her or others uncomfortable, I'd respect that more. Instead, when she did confront me about it, she said \"arent you uncomfortable?\"; then insinuated I lacked common decency. She made her feelings out to be a fault in my character.

I wouldn't see a problem. But I've also been to nudist beaches with my parents so I'm maybe I'm bias due to upbringing. I don't see nudity as a sexualised thing and it isn't a big deal to me. (Not that wearing a t shirt that covers your underwear is nude).\n\nAlso with respect I don't think your comparison is fair. Most people will cringe if their parents do a lot of things but wouldn't cringe if it were a roommate.

Her being so difficult and kicking up such a fuss over pulling some shorts over her legs before walking out of her room is very telling.\n\n It isn't and should not be that big of a deal yet it is.

But I guess the responses show maybe I'm in the minority", "the length isn't the only thing that freaking matters. \n\nThe cut and the fabric matter too. \n\nTshirts are typically baggy and thin - making much more likely that someone will see her panties or the outline of her nipples. \n\nHow many women do you know who wear a mini skirt/dress when they at home? They don't because you have to be careful and can't just flop and lounge around like most people do at home. \n\nSo just because you're comfortable with it everyone else has to be right?

Target PJ's and a tank top w no bra are comfy too and it would make your roomate (who you are LIVING with) a lot more comfortable, and I don't think that's a huge concession to make or that it would sacrifice comfort.

You share that space with others and others are allowed to have people come over and not have their boundaries stomped on by having a half naked girl walking around trying to make small talk with them. I find this to be just as much of a consent issue as a boundary issue because you\u2019re not just doing this in front of your roomate which would mean you where keeping it private to some extent.\n\nEdit: Frankly she\u2019s right you do lack common decency.
