{"id": 8427, "submission_id": "10mlyaf", "title": "AITA for selling a PDF copy of a textbook to my fellow classmates that was available online for free", "selftext": "So in university, I (21f) discovered that I could get PDF copies of textbooks for my classes instead of buying/renting the versions offered by the school because the PDF versions were significantly cheaper. If I couldn\u2019t find a free version of the textbook online somewhere, I\u2019d find a site selling cheap PDF copies online- it generally took a while to find the copies but it saved me quite a bit of money. \nI always look online for free/cheap versions before my classes start. If I can\u2019t find some, I\u2019ll generally start the course and decide if I really need to buy the expensive version. (We\u2019ve all been there- buying a textbook you don\u2019t really use). In one of my classes, I initially couldn\u2019t find any free or cheap pdf copies, I had looked online for a while. If I remember correctly the actual version was pretty expensive (150$ range) but it may have been less (110$ range). At first it seemed like I could get away relatively ok without using a textbook. About 2-3 weeks after the class started however, I realized it would be a better idea to just get one. I did the same thing, looked online, wasn\u2019t having any luck. Then I found a version for about 40$. I bought it and went on my way. After thinking about it a little more, and realizing how hard it is in general to find those PDF versions, I thought to offer a cheap alternative with the rest of the class. I decided to send an email to everyone and sell copies of the version I bought for 5$. I thought this was a win-win; fellow students would get an ultra cheap version, I would off set my costs, and I didn\u2019t feel like I was extorting anyone because 5$ is literally the price of a coffee. No one was going to be getting rich, and obviously other students can look for their own version aka no one is forced to buy anything. I would have appreciated the option to buy a cheap version if I was struggling to find my own. So I send this email, two people buy the textbook, then I get this really angry email about how it\u2019s awful of me to be profiting off students who are already struggling and how I should be ashamed of myself. I nicely answered it and explained that I bought my version and wasn\u2019t like \u201cgetting rich\u201d off of broke students. I honestly don\u2019t really get why the writer was so offended\u2026 It\u2019s a 5$ textbook, which is ridiculously cheap, classes had been going on for over 3 weeks which is a long time semester wise, and also you have free will? 4 days later someone sends a link in the same email thread to a free version online. Now I feel like a pos\u2026 so AITA?\n\nEdit: I truly and wholehearted didn\u2019t go into it thinking many people were going to buy the textbook, again it had already been a decent amount of time since the class started, so I assumed those who could buy it would have already- it was intended like a \u201cHey! Here\u2019s a cheap copy if you\u2019ve been avoiding buying the expensive version like me, maybe we can all get it for 5$\u201d \n\nI am aware the copyright part is wrong.. The PDF version I bought was not from a copyright respecting site\u2026 which is why it was cheaper than the actual versions. I guess you could say I did not sell the most legally obtained version of the book.. also steps were taken to protect my identity. I guess when it\u2019s buy a textbook or buy groceries for the week, and suffer grade wise, it\u2019s motivation to find alternatives on the dark web.. the other student who found it for free was definitely better at scouring it than I was lol. \n\nOnce I found out the book was available for free I did offer the students their money back, one didn\u2019t answer, the other said that they really didn\u2019t mind paying and to just keep it. \n\nEvery other time I have found a textbook online for free I\u2019ve sent the links to the class like the other person did", "created_utc": 1674829161, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mlyaf/aita_for_selling_a_pdf_copy_of_a_textbook_to_my/", "score": 320, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were just trying to break even - but even if you had been aiming for a profit, it wouldn't be an AH move.

All the Y T As are weird to me because they conflate the law with morality.", "NTA, you should charge more though because once they kick out of school and you start dealing with lawsuits the $5 bucks will not cover it.
