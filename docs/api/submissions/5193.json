Life has been tough without my mom.\n\nAnyways, this summer I took a trip to Toronto on my own to go see my sister who I hadn\u2019t seen in many years due to family drama (my sister is not a fan of my dad). After reconnecting, we spent days on end discussing my dad, who frequently prioritized his \u201cneeds\u201d over his children. My sister revealed what happened between my step-mom, mom and dad where apparently my mom found emails between my dad and step-mom which confirmed her suspicions. My mom ended up finding the work place of my step-mom and exposed to them what she had been doing with my father. My step-mom countered with a cease and desist letter and the exposition stopped.\n\nAfter hearing this story, I couldn\u2019t help but feel bad for my mom.

I did not insult her, nor attack her in anyway, I simply asked her if it was true.

She says it\u2019s absolutely un acceptable that me and my sister discussed about this as it concerns her. I replied saying that I think I had the right to know this, as I was a victim of the affair at home (my mom is Burmese and her childhood was pretty rough, she could get tough on me as well). She said it\u2019s ridiculous that I know, and said she could\u2019ve destroyed my mom in court if she so wished. At this point, I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing. I explained to her what a \u2018homewrecker\u2019 was and she stated my generation was fucked up for creating such a term. I told her I don\u2019t get why this is even such a big deal, as I never held it against her even though I very much had the right to.\n\nThe discussion ended, and that was that.

Your step mother has gone through HORRIBLE things, but that doesn\u2019t make it right to freeze you out or to treat you poorly. You deserve kindness and love just like everyone else. This type of punishment is very common in that culture (my wife is Bataq and from Indonesia - she is a pro at it). This punishment is very cruel and she is using it to program you into being what she wants by removing love. \n\nFrom what you wrote, it sounds like your dad and step mom think that they were being compassionate for not \u201cdestroying your mom\u201d in court. This is gaslighting. They are covering their asses and want you to accept what they did as something noble. \n\nPlease ask for therapy, if they refuse, wait until you go to university. Also, most medical associations here in the US have a \u201cMy Chart\u201d where you can login and get appointments. Because you are over 14, your stepmom and dad can\u2019t see that. Maybe try there.", "NTA now you know why your family is apart and who wanted to isolate you after that. The people you're living with are not the healthiest part of the family, no doubt. It's normal to see these things when we grow up, stay in touch with your sister and your mother and don't allow her to isolate you again.

But I know people are going to disagree with me on that assessment.  When a husband cheats, it is common for the wife to blame the other woman.  But the other woman did not make a promise to the wife.  The husband did.  So if you are angry at the other woman, your anger is misplaced.  Having trouble with that concept?  OK, think of it this way.  Your husband is the kind of guy to cheat on his wife.  So let's say he hooks up with Susan.  You have a magic wand, you can use it to erase Susan (like she was never born).  ZAP!  Susan was never born.  Next thing you know, your husband is hooking up with Cheryl.  He's now hooking up with Cheryl, as he couldn't hook up with Susan.  So all that anger you had for Susan was just wasted.  Susan was not the problem, and neither is Cheryl, now.  You are angry and calling the woman a 'homewrecker'.  YTA, as the only homewrecker was the guy who couldn't keep it in his pants.   If it hadn't been step mom, it would have been some other woman.  If your husband strays, there is nothing to investigate.  You know all you need to...your husband is a cheater.  Focus on the problem.  The problem is not a woman.  The problem is your dad.", "I\u2019m not sure how different slander/libel laws are between the US and Canada, but \u201cdestroy her in court\u201d seems unlikely as (at least in the states) she\u2019d have to prove that the statements were both malicious AND false. A mother telling her daughter that her father had an extramarital affair and then married that affair partner, if true, meets neither criteria. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sure how old your stepmother is, but unless your parents were on the older side when they had you I\u2019m presuming mid-40\u2019s to early-60\u2019s. The term home wrecker has been around at least that long. She can absolutely refuse to engage in the conversation further, but she has no right to demand your silence about an issue in which you were collateral damage.", "So fucking wrong. She knew he was married. She chose to have an affair. She is just as wrong as the husband.", "I understand what you\u2019re saying but in this instance the other woman was aware of the wife so she\u2019s an AH and you\u2019re assuming OP\u2019s mum didn\u2019t hold the dad responsible but it\u2019s not really relevant to this AITA question", "[removed]", "I'm not saying it's right for a woman to have sex with a married man.  But so many wives that discover their husband's cheating lay 100% of the blame on the woman.  That's nuts.  At worst, the other woman is maybe 5% of the problem.  After all, as I wrote before...if he's going to stray, he will find a willing partner.  If his mistress didn't exist, somebody else would be the mistress.  So who is the real problem in that situation?", "Actually, the story I read, the OP mom basically waged war on the other woman.  She was so hostile, the other woman had to get the law involved.  YIKES.  And yet I hear no mention of any similar action taken against the husband.  So to me, it reads like a pretty typical scenario where the wife (after learning that hubby is cheating) goes nutso and attacks the other woman, laying most of the blame on her.  When the husband clearly is most responsible for what happened.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
