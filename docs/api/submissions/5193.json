But I know people are going to disagree with me on that assessment.  When a husband cheats, it is common for the wife to blame the other woman.  But the other woman did not make a promise to the wife.  The husband did.  So if you are angry at the other woman, your anger is misplaced.  Having trouble with that concept?  OK, think of it this way.  Your husband is the kind of guy to cheat on his wife.  So let's say he hooks up with Susan.  You have a magic wand, you can use it to erase Susan (like she was never born).  ZAP!  Susan was never born.  Next thing you know, your husband is hooking up with Cheryl.  He's now hooking up with Cheryl, as he couldn't hook up with Susan.  So all that anger you had for Susan was just wasted.  Susan was not the problem, and neither is Cheryl, now.  You are angry and calling the woman a 'homewrecker'.  YTA, as the only homewrecker was the guy who couldn't keep it in his pants.   If it hadn't been step mom, it would have been some other woman.  If your husband strays, there is nothing to investigate.  You know all you need to...your husband is a cheater.  Focus on the problem.  The problem is not a woman.  The problem is your dad.", "I\u2019m not sure how different slander/libel laws are between the US and Canada, but \u201cdestroy her in court\u201d seems unlikely as (at least in the states) she\u2019d have to prove that the statements were both malicious AND false. A mother telling her daughter that her father had an extramarital affair and then married that affair partner, if true, meets neither criteria. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sure how old your stepmother is, but unless your parents were on the older side when they had you I\u2019m presuming mid-40\u2019s to early-60\u2019s.

After all, as I wrote before...if he's going to stray, he will find a willing partner.  If his mistress didn't exist, somebody else would be the mistress.
