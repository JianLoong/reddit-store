My husband has a sister, who well call \u201cMarie\u201d (32f).\n\nMarie likes to think of herself as very woke. I support her and I think it\u2019s good although sometimes I think she may go overboard. Since we have adopted Kaya, Marie has commented on things like that \u201cpeople won\u2019t believe your her parents\u201d, which admittedly I\u2019ve been pissed off about and told her to keep quiet, but I\u2019ve never seen her change her behaviour around the subject of kayas adoption. Keep in mind she will make a comment like this, almost every time we see her.\n\nRecently, I found out I was pregnant and we announced we were having another baby to our family and everyone was very happy for us, although Marie didn\u2019t seem too happy I didn\u2019t question it because I wanted to keep it a happy moment. \n\nWe\u2019ve been exposing Kaya to her culture and teaching her basic words in ojibwe. This is where the problem began. \nThe other day I decided to host a family dinner for a mini celebration over that I was pregnant. at dinner, we had My parents, and my in laws over. Which included my MIL, FIL, Marie, and David\u2019s other brother who we will call \u201cJack\u201d.\nSo when we sat down to eat, Kaya demonstrated her learning by saying love (zaagi\u2019) in ojibwe. Marie went silent and didn\u2019t say anything. While everyone else oohed and awwed about Kaya. I turned and asked Marie what was wrong. She says \u201cI\u2019m glad Kaya is learning about her REAL culture now, ATLEAST your not stealing this baby from a minority too.\u201d \n\nI lost it. I screamed at her saying sounds like she\u2019s against adoption, and why did she care so much we adopted Kaya. I then told her to get out. She left and dinner was pretty awkward after that.\n\nMy parents, David, and jack, are all on my side. But Marie and my MIL & FIL say I was too harsh and she didn\u2019t \u201cmean any harm\u201d. \n\nMarie has since made and angry post about me too Facebook, left many voicemails and texts from her and her friends, etc. I have told her she is no longer welcome around me, Kaya, or the new baby. \n\nI\u2019m starting to think I may be going to far, but I want more opinions. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1685229127, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13tl2ah/aita_for_yelling_at_my_sil_for_comments_on_my/", "score": 109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

About the situation that lead to her living with you? Your daughter is far better off with you than bouncing around the foster care. \n\nIf she actually cared she'd help encourage your daughter with learning her language and connecting with her roots.

Do you have any contact with her Aunts, Uncles or Grandparents? Do you know exactly which tribe she is from? Could you get an elder from her tribe to take her under their wing?  \nFamily lines cannot be overstated when It comes to learning, and the closer she can get to her family the more she will grow. Theres alot of teachings that can only be passed down within certain families. She does have the potential to loose a lot by not growing up in that environment. Language and traditional teaching can vary greatly too, from tribe to tribe, so learning the \"general\" language isnt really the same. \n\n...Do you know if the removal of your daughter was due to poverty vs. a situation that requires intervention? Does her parents still want contact?

Inter-generational harm from children adopted out of their culture is a real thing. \n\nIt\u2019s great that you care about Kaya having connection to culture. But it also sounds a bit like a game. She\u2019s learning some words - are the rest of the family learning the language? What do you do to maintain culture outside of learning some words? What connection does Kaya have to her wider birth family and community?\n\nI don\u2019t know the circumstances of Kaya\u2019s adoption. I also come from a place where children were routinely stolen and continue to be taken at horrifying levels. The rules for kinship care and adoption within culture are also affected by racism and poverty and the effects of both in communities. So I\u2019m speaking from a place of knowing children have been and are taken away from their community in ways that are really problematic. And while adoptive parents are loving and do what they can for their kids (hopefully - unfortunately not true for all the kids) - there remains cultural harm. \n\nI hope this does not happen in your country. I wish it did not happen in mine. \n\nIt would not surprise me if your SIL had heard of such problems and considers you to be part of the group that has and is perpetuating harm through adoption of indigenous kids into non-indigenous homes.

That it means that no one from her tribe was able to take her in? That poor girl. \n\nYes, there is a huge problem with aboriginal children being taken from their homes for whatever reasons and being placed with people who are not of their race. That's not your fault. That's the system's fault. You just want to provide a home for your daughter and I'm glad that you're exposing her to her culture and language. Most adoptive parents don't, which is harmful to a child that has probably faced more than we'll ever know.\n\nIf your SIL cares so much, why isn't she in DC, fighting for ICWA? Why isn't she lobbying against the eighteen states that were explicit that privatizing support for Native children would further reduce welfare costs and fill remaining federal funding gaps because Native children required far fewer welfare dollars when placed in the home of a middle class or wealthy foster or adoptive family than in the home of a Native family living in poverty?\n\nAs an aboriginal woman, your SIL'a fakeness disgusts me. To top it off, she has to say all of that stuff in front of Kaya, who is probably already traumatized from her past experiences, and who has to know that no one in her family, nor her tribe, were able to take her in. Your SIL is a very sick sick woman, and I would keep her and your patronizing in-laws away from your children, before they hurt them even more. Shame on them. \n\nP.S. the Anishinaabe people do not like being called Ojibwe. That is the colonizer term for their people.
