I have done everything I can to maintain the relationship of Kid and Ex, although contact between them is now sporadic and down to around 4 times a year. Kid says that they rarely do anything together or go out anywhere; when she is with Ex they sit in the flat, in separate rooms, watching YouTube videos and so Kid doesn't see the point in going.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn't mind making no money on the flat when it was somewhere safe for Kid to spend half her week. Now that she spends, max, 10 nights a year there, I do mind. In addition, Ex is a terrible tenant. The place will cost thousands to put right when she does move out (you won't be surprised to hear, I never got a deposit from her) and getting even the most basic safety checks conducted is near impossible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm looking at the future and wondering, will this headache ever end? The incessant calls, texts, begging for money, trying to negotiate over next month's rent - at what point can I cut her off? Kid cares deeply for Ex and will be quite distressed if Ex is homeless, but how long can I plug this hole for? For as long as she lives in that flat she will have (to her mind) cause to contact me every day. Every. Single. Day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes, giving her notice on the flat will essentially make her homeless because she wouldn't pass credit checks to rent privately, has no means of coming up with a deposit and doesn't have the persistence needed to chase council housing. But for how long do I need to take responsibility for her?  Will Kid look back one day and blame me for not supporting Ex for longer? If I don't cut Ex off now and instead wait until Kid is an adult, what if at that time she just leeches off Kid instead?

She should have taken that opportunity to get her life and financials in order. \n\nYou initially bought the place so that your child could have stable housing but now that they live with you, there's no need for that anymore. It makes sense to sell it on or get other tenants who will pay fair rent. The money you could be making/saving could go directly to your child's future instead eg college fund.\n\nYour wife is an absolute saint I agree with you there, but keep this up much longer and I'm sure that will change. Everyone has a breaking point and my husband putting us in financial distress to support his ex would do it for me. Your ex is not your responsibility, she's a grown woman, your child is.", "NTA, but (and this really depends on the age of your kid) you should have an honest an open talk with your kid about all this. \nMake sure they understand that whilst you care for the Ex all you are doing is enabling the behaviour", "NTA... your kid will totally understand.... u cant keep putting the extra financial burden on yourself and ruining your credit... at the end you will be responsible for the apartments you rent for ex...", "NTA \n\nThat all sounds like a her problem than a you problem and from.what youve said she will likely continue to take advantage of your generosity until you do something about it", "YWNBTA. You've given her WAY more than most people would already, and sounds like she's ungrateful for everyone who tries helping her. She burns every bridge she crosses, and is now out of options and will no doubt blame you, but in reality she put herself there.", "YWNTBA, you have given the ex plenty of time, grace, and opportunity to improve her life. You can only help people so much if they aren\u2019t willing to help themselves. I think the important part is how you go about it.

(Not that it\u2019s really \u201cworking\u201d right now but you know) Depending on the kids age, that part might be tricky right now.

Perhaps approach from the perspective of 'do you think this is fair' 'it costs a lot to be in this situation' how long do you think is reasonable for ex to find new place? Etc (age appropriate ofc).

Make a token gesture to try and connect her to social housing services just so you can tell your kid you tried that.\n\nExplain to your kid in ways they can understand. Emphasize that mom is the one choosing not to live in the flat (she is only there ten days of the year) you bought the flat for your son, and he now lives with you, that it's been half a decade and mom has had enough time to get her stuff together, and that you will always try to facilitate your son's relationship with his mom.

It is a tough situation, I would consider first take it to counselling and then deciding what to do and the best way to do it - I wouldnt solely guide myself from strangers in a forum. A lot of people here dont know the situation you are in and will give you advice through the lens of someone who sees everything in black and white, and honestly, they love to give advice that I doubt most of them would follow if they were actually in the ops' shoes.
