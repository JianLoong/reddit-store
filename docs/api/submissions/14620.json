Or is there some backstory not disclosed in your post?", "NTA. Your husband thinks once a month is \u201coften\u201d and that you\u2019re not putting your marriage first? Huh??? He has some issues he needs to deal with. \n\nKeep visiting your mom. This might be something for couples counselling to help you and your husband work through.", "INFO: what does your husband feel would be an acceptable number of visits to your mom? \n\nThis feels very controlling to me. Just be aware that isolating a partner from their family is a common tactic when one partner is trying to control the other. You live close to your mom so what other friends do with their parents has no bearing on your situation. **NTA**", "NTA.  I can see why your mom doesn't like him.  A once a month quick visit to your mother is not a lot to ask.  Unless there is something missing in this, he is just being a controlling AH.", "NTA, and neither is your mom.  Your husband wins the award.\n\nHe says two days a month is too much time?  Fuck off.  Your mom even pays for the tickets!\n\nHe wants you to demand that she comes to visit you?  Fuck off.  They don\u2019t get along (and he doesn\u2019t like your step dad either), so you\u2019re doing him a favor by going to see her.\n\nYou love your mom, and your controlling husband is being a turd.

Your husband is not being fair to you. This should not be an argument between you two so long as you're not breaking plans with him and going to your mom's on a whim. If they're mostly planned and don't conflict, then he should enjoy the chance for himself to have his time as well.

Continue visiting your mother, because, unfortunately, when the day comes, she will know that her only daughter cared for her through all her troubles.

Your husband is though. She pays, and it\u2019s once a month. Saying you\u2019re not prioritizing your marriage and him over one visit a month. Sounds like he\u2019s the one with issues.

It\u2019s once a month, and your mom has very valid concerns over why she would prefer you visit her.", "NTA - it\u2019s your mum and you can visit her when you like even if your husband doesn\u2019t like her. He sounds controlling.", "NTA.\n\nIt's fine if your mother and your husband don't get along, but it's not right of him to expect you to cut her out of your life because of that. Going to visit her once a month doesn't mean you're putting her before your marriage.", "NTA - Your husband is gaslighting you. If he tells you that you need to \u201cput your foot down\u201d and not visit her, the implication is she is forcing you. Which is clearly not true.", "100% NTA", "NTA.\n\nUnless there is a history of abuse or toxicity (which it seems from your post there is not), then why wouldn't you visit your mom? It's once a month, it's not even costing you money. If you have a healthy relationship with your mom, this is what we do when our parent age. Heck, I have to fly many miles to visit my dad, so I can't do it often, but I do talk with him on the phone a lot (my dad is in his 90s).\n\nIs this a pattern? Does he try to control other aspects of your life? Does he have a bad relationship wth his own family? Or is he just lonely and wanting to spend time with you?", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s once a bloody month not once a week or day.   Op keep doing what you\u2019re doing well mum is still around", "NTA - If you were going more often, this might change, but once a month is clearly not excessive.", "Once a month is an argument to visit your mom? That\u2019s insane, she even pays for your trip. Your husband is being an AH.", "NTA that is your mother and your husband gets you 27ish other days a month to himself. He is incredibly selfish for even suggesting that you don\u2019t see your mom because he doesn\u2019t like her. This is a huge red flag and you may need to get out of this marriage. If she comes to you she has to get a hotel?!? Jfc the writing is on the wall for sure!", "NTA. When a spouse is keeping the other from seeing their parents, it's usually a red flag.  Once a month visit is more than reasonable. My sister-in-law is in a similar situation. Her husband is controlling and toxic.", "NAH but I\u2019m seeing red flags and they are not coming from your husband.  imho, you and your mother seem to have a co-dependent relationship.", "INFO why don\u2019t they get along?", "NTA - your husband is being controlling.", "Your husband is mad about once a month???\n\nThat\u2019s hardly putting your mother over your marriage, and these visits are also for you.\n\nI don\u2019t think being in your 50\u2019s is too old to travel though. But if you are happy to visit her, there\u2019s nothing to \u201cput your foot down\u201d about.\n\nHe may fundamentally have a different expectation of how often someone should visit their parents when they are adults; but he\u2019s being a jerk about it to you. And unless there is abuse involved, it\u2019s unfair to try and \u201crecruit\u201d you to dislike your mom as much as he does. \n\nDoes your husband have any strong relationships - family or friendship - outside of you? Because this sounds like maybe he doesn\u2019t, or doesn\u2019t think he should.", "Visiting your mum once a month is going to take a toll on your marriage? What kind of flimsy marriage is that?\nAnd by visiting your mum once a month, you won't have enough time to devote to your future child? Doesn't he realise that there's literally the rest of the month and he is also the parent of this child-to-be? I don't know how he can talk about being a good mother to your child while insisting you be a rubbish child to your own?!\nFrankly he sounds way too controlling and immature. Are you sure this is the guy you want to make babies with?\nNTA.", "I think you should read Why does he do that? by Derek Lundy.\n\nYour husband sounds selfish and controlling. Seeing your mother who you have a good relationship with is not a lot. His relationship with your mother shouldn't affect yours. \n\nIt also sounds like he's pressuring you about kids and you definitely don't sound ready yet. Please read the book before you have kids with him.", "Missing some information, but it sounds like ESH. \n\nYour mom only feels comfortable around you, and not her son-in-law, because she hasn\u2019t known her son-in-law as long? Your husband rides up on the train and has to stay with someone else? \n\nParents are important, but your mom not getting along with your husband/ not wanting him around because she\u2019s known you the longest doesn\u2019t make any sense. One or more people are being toxic in this situation; otherwise, you would have the option to sometimes visit your family as couple, which is the norm.\n\nEdit: To clarify, your husband sucks for asking you to reduce the amount of time spent with your elderly parent instead of attempting to work out their differences. Your mom sucks for intentionally leaving out your husband. You suck for going along with this arrangement and for failing to understand how that might make your husband feel. How would you feel if he spent one weekend a month with his mom and you weren\u2019t invited?", "I am in your same shoes being the only child (daughter)...my whole life it was just my mom and me because my dad died before I was 2.  \n\nYour mom gave you life and I don't think that the problem lies with you at all.  Your husband seems to be waiving a red flag...not sure how long you've been married but I think a convo about this needs to happen and a hard boundary needs to be defined.  It's not like you are going every weekend or every other...\n\nNTA, but your husband sounds like he has some of the symptoms!", "NTA Classic controlling is to isolate you from family. Putting marriage first involves siding with your husband when family bullies him, or not sending all your money to family, leaving you and your husband very hard up, or spending all your weekends with family. What you are doing is just normal mother daughter contact. Be very careful having a child with this man. Where there is one flag there will be more.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

OP's husband is *not* just being irrationally controlling; given how enmeshed OP and her mother are, and how controlling her mother is, I'd say that OP's husband probably has good reason to want her to cut down on the visits. That said, OP's husband *may also* be controlling; the information in this post doesn't provide enough information for me to feel I can make that call, but I do know that it is not uncommon for a person who has grown up in service to a parent's anxieties to go on to marry someone with inclinations similar to that controlling parent's.", "And the mom now refuses to visit because she's old and shouldn't have to!.
