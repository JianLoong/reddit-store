You sound like a very kind, empathetic coworker. Your GF should feel very proud that she is in a relationship with such a caring person.", "NTA, but I can understand your SO if say she loved those cookies and decided to save them for you to have. \nI would be pissed too.

That was a kind thing to do (especially if the cookie contained chocolate, which helps with smooth muscle spasms). \n\nIt's unfortunate your SO feels that way. \n\nMy personal experience: I've had people close to me take carefully chosen gifts from me and give them to someone else without saying a word.

You need to address that accordingly. Are you too familiar? If it's simply a case where you're a genuinely empathetic person, then your SO needs to get on board and give you the freedom to thrive.

I really only talk about it with my boyfriend, but that\u2019s just me. \n\nIf your girlfriend gets insecure often all you need to do is just give her reassurance.

Yes, been there, done that, tried to give the t-shirt back!\n\nYou offered a portion of one cookie to said friend in an effort to help make her day better. That's pretty cool.\n\nYour SO isn't happy you gave a portion of cookie to friend because the cookies were meant to be a comforting gesture. And this is where the record scratch comes in. What?! The cookie not only comforted you, but a friend, so said cookies did their job. In fact, the cookies did their job better than initially planned because they helped two people, not one.\n\nI have a scenario running through my head and if it's the case then I must say, your SO needs to get over herself.

Talk to her about why it made her uncomfortable. You\u2019re okay op", "NTA. I don't understand people who want partners that are kind and then get upset when those partners are kind to someone other than them. You are either a kind person who's instinct is to help someone in pain or you're not.

If she\u2019s someone who needs a certain level of comfort to openly discuss her period, maybe she\u2019s assuming your coworker has the same comfort level with you. \n\nYou guys are pretty young and I\u2019m saying this as someone who has been married for 11 years. It can be difficult to articulate what\u2019s actually bothering you. That\u2019s doubly if discussing those feelings means you have to take a hard look at your own flaws. When we argue, we try to discuss the fight calmly once we\u2019ve cooled off.

That was very kind of you!! Also, I kind of like that your coworker just told you the truth instead of conforming to the stigma around not talking about periods. I think your SO probably has that stigma internalized and I can understand her reaction within that context, but you didn\u2019t do anything wrong- you shared a cookie with someone having a bad day, and that\u2019s a nice thing to do.", "I think you SO is overreacting, I don\u2019t know that I would\u2019ve even thought to tell my SO about it because sharing a cookie with someone isn\u2019t a big deal??

I just find it so unfathomable.\n\nTo be clear, I have absolutely been insecure and jealous at times in my life. And I have dealt with partners of my own who were unfaithful or gave me reason to be insecure. But ultimately, don't we all want to be with someone who is kind and generous, thoughtful and caring? Isn't that the goal? And it shouldn't impact our own relationships if they are good. If we are with a partner who has never given us reason to be suspicious of them, then we should be PROUD when we see them show kindness to someone else.\n\nYou mention in the judgement bot that she thinks you showed \"comfort meant for those in a relationship\". I find that appalling. You shared a piece of cookie with someone in physical discomfort. That's something kindergarteners do. That is not an intimate act. It seems like your partner's insecurity isn't of the reasonable sort.\n\nAssuming that you are generally a good partner to your SO, she should have been proud that your response to a coworker being in discomfort was, \"Here, let me make a small gesture of kindness towards you.\" It shows that you're a person with a good heart, someone she can be proud to be with. I'm sorry that instead, she reacted selfishly. That's . . . not really okay. You are NTA. You did nothing at all wrong.", "NAH - You're definitely not an asshole for wanting to share.  If I'm given something that makes me happy, I often want to spread the wealth or pay it forward somehow and that's what it seems like you were doing.  However, I'm also a gemini and if I gave something special to my S.O., I would want them to enjoy ALL of it because I'm a little bit selfish like that.  Here's the rub though and where your SO is over reacting - I'm the one who wants them to enjoy it all, but once a gift has been given it is the recipient's choice on how to enjoy it.  If giving away half of one cookie means they still enjoyed 2 full cookies in some way, then I would need to check my gut reaction to be like \"but that was YOURS it was meant for YOU.\"", "If I gave someone something to eat and they just give it to another person on a regular basis I'd be disappointed.

That means you have a really controlling and unpleasant So who is not compassionate or thoughtful.  I sure hope they have other redeeming qualities.", "NTA if a male coworker had come up to you complaining of back ache, you may have given him half a cookie to try and cheer him up.

Forgive my ignorance and lack of understanding. Is she mad because you gave away a cookie meant as a gift from her to you or is she mad that you were kind to another human?", "She got mad because you gave a friend a cookie? Like a real cookie, not some euphemism that I'm too old to have caught yet. An actual baked good, which you shared in an effort to make someone feel better?\n\nAbsolutely NTA but I'd seriously re-evaluate the relationship if that's the level of jealousy and possessive behavior she exhibits. The controlling types always escalate.", "Nta your gf sounds controlling", "NTA. HUGE red flag on your SO, BTW. Seems like someone who wants to control everything you do.

You made a commitment to her not strangers on Reddit. And this was a cookie your SO specifically bought for you from a bakery so yeah I wouldn\u2019t be happy either", "I swear, some of these are so bad they couldn't even be fake...", "NTA, you were trying to help a colleague feel better. It's a show of fairly basic empathy, and it's not like you gave her the entirety of an expensive cookie, you gave her a chunk.\n\nGiving comfort to people, that you're already familiar with, in the innocent extend of sharing a part of a cookie is not a red flag.
