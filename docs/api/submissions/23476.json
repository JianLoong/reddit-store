You need to address that accordingly. Are you too familiar? If it's simply a case where you're a genuinely empathetic person, then your SO needs to get on board and give you the freedom to thrive.

I really only talk about it with my boyfriend, but that\u2019s just me. \n\nIf your girlfriend gets insecure often all you need to do is just give her reassurance.

Yes, been there, done that, tried to give the t-shirt back!\n\nYou offered a portion of one cookie to said friend in an effort to help make her day better. That's pretty cool.\n\nYour SO isn't happy you gave a portion of cookie to friend because the cookies were meant to be a comforting gesture. And this is where the record scratch comes in. What?! The cookie not only comforted you, but a friend, so said cookies did their job. In fact, the cookies did their job better than initially planned because they helped two people, not one.\n\nI have a scenario running through my head and if it's the case then I must say, your SO needs to get over herself.

I don't understand people who want partners that are kind and then get upset when those partners are kind to someone other than them. You are either a kind person who's instinct is to help someone in pain or you're not.

If she\u2019s someone who needs a certain level of comfort to openly discuss her period, maybe she\u2019s assuming your coworker has the same comfort level with you. \n\nYou guys are pretty young and I\u2019m saying this as someone who has been married for 11 years. It can be difficult to articulate what\u2019s actually bothering you. That\u2019s doubly if discussing those feelings means you have to take a hard look at your own flaws. When we argue, we try to discuss the fight calmly once we\u2019ve cooled off.

Especially when you accidentally poke my cervix and my uterus tries to escape out of my vagina! \n\n\ud83d\ude02", "I'd loan you mine but he only does that so he can get close enough to steal your cookies. \ud83e\udd23", "I've had three who were \"nurse cats.\" #3 came along after my hysterectomy, so instead she curled around my head when I had a migraine.", "My cat prefers to be on my chest, as close to blocking my airway as possible.", "As a guy, OP doesn't know that her co-worker isn't gonna feel better by having a chunk of cookie. OP did it because it was a nice gesture and I appreciate him for that. He's a good lad who respects people and takes cares of those in need.  \nMost women have experienced period pain and know that a bit of cookie would do jackshit so they probably won't offer something like that. If OP was a woman, she would probably try to make the co-worker feel better by certain different ways. Her female perspective would make things easier and better.  \nSigh.  \nPlease don't try to slam-dunk me with \"wElL akshually I'm a woman and I wouldn't have offered anything but a chunk-a-cookie\" because exceptions and outliers are everywhere and this won't be gotcha if you think it would be. It would just make you sound like an asshole.  \n\n\nAlso, I'm tired of this \"Society is so heteronormative\" bs. If a MAN was killed by someone whose identity and gender is unknown, I'm not gonna assume that the perpetrator is a woman or a transgender. I'll assume it's a man because numbers don't lie and most perpetrators are male. Similarly, I'll assume that a person is he/she unless they clarify otherwise because the numbers don't fucking lie and most people are straight and \"cis-gendered\"(hate that term).", "I don't disagree with your overall point.  I do think some people just don't really understand some of it and then misapply it when it suits their needs.  I don't think it is always necessarily nefarious though but just general human selfishness + a dose of low intelligence.", "No", "Mmm while I totally understand that is why you suggested bringing your partner, I think the reason there is insecurity surrounding this colleague is because your SO doesn't trust them or their intentions. Just have a chat with your partner and ask her how she's feeling.", "Your gf is insecure. Make sure you always let her know that she is #1 in your life, that should help. If you do that, and she is still this insecure, run.", "Do yourself a favor and don't date an older woman, unless you lean toward the submissive side and are looking for a dominant woman.  In which case, this type of controlling / possessive behavior may be the outcome.  Since she exerted her dominance and you acquiesced, you may expect more of it in the future.  Some men seek that relationship, which ofc is fine.  Whether or not you are the AH depends on what type of relationship you are looking for.", "Henceforth, coworker wanted to get me out. I said i\u2019d go out with my gf", "For this young male(19) to come to Reddit to make sure he was not AITA, sounds like it was more than just communicating feelings. She must have made him feel like he REALLY did something wrong. \n\nThey have been dating for two years, She was 19 and he was 17.", "The person above you responded to the the original post. You can't expect people to read every response and scan for additional information before they give their opinion.", "But was it like \u201chey let\u2019s go on a date!\u201d or \u201cI will treat you for your birthday, totally as a friend.\u201d I took my guy friend/co-worker out for ice cream for his birthday. My husband came with us. Friend\u2019s wife was invited but declined. None of us thought it was weird. OTOH, both of us had been married to our spouses for over 15 years at that point, so things like jealousies or insecurities were gone long ago.", "AND SHE could have been in college. \n\nAfter this little situation I think it COULD BE red flag", "I wouldn\u2019t classify asking someone out as something between the two though. Like OP said he had a GF. And pretty much declined. Why be mad at OP? You can still be friendly with people after the fact.", "We're just going to have to have to agree to disagree on this. If giving someone a cookie is a breech of trust, there is something seriously wrong.", "Did she follow thru w the brunch? What did the coworker say?", "That lived up to my expectations, thank you.", "Ok, so she *was* kind of asking you out when she knows you have a girlfriend. I can see your gf not wanting you to be on a \"close enough to talk about periods/genitals and doing little thoughtful things to comfort eachother\" level of friendship after that. \n\nMy husband would distance himself from a coworker who tried to set up a solo meal date/he got those vibes from, without me asking. He would still share a cookie with her. I'd probably be a little snarky for a few minutes. You're NTA.", "Explains alot lmao. But it shouldn't hurt to share a cookie..", "Yeah I\u2019m not saying YTA here at all, just that it adds a bit more context to the story on why she might feel that way. \n\nStill, it seems like a wild overreaction and obvious signs of jealousy on her part.", "lol this is all total nonsense", "What kind of narrow fucking view of the world is this?", "This is hilarious.", "Yeah she should have communicated her feelings instead of flying off the handle over a cookie", "I went back through his comments and he said after he suggested bringing his GF the coworker ended up not taking him out to brunch.", "He never clarified what the coworkers reply was about the GF coming so that part is up in the air.", "Yes but imo giving a gift from a significant other to someone that asked you out before is obviously going to make one\u2019s partner feel insecure. How insecure/upset depends on the person and relationship. Some would say nothing cuz it\u2019s not a big deal to them even if it irked them, others would have a short convo about it saying \u201cI wish that didn\u2019t happen but you had no idea and thought it was harmless, so now going forward I hope now that you know that I feel it won\u2019t with stuff I give/gift you\u201d\n\nAnd others go ballistic \n\nThe reaction depends but imo anyone giving a gift (no matter how big or how small) from a partner to another person who asked you out and is in close proximity to you weekly should known it will hurt your partner. Maybe they will be 1/10 hurt, maybe 9/10, that idk. But your partner will remember or be effected even if only for a minute or a day.", "That's the only reasoning I can come up with, if there was some kind of history between OP and the co-worker. In that case, it would be about more than a cookie. But aside from that, yes very insecure/controlling sentiment.", "Did not, haven\u2019t spoken to coworker since", "No, it\u2019s not..", "I would honestly limit interactions at work to work related only. And if she tries to share personal info just say \u2018I don\u2019t feel comfortable discussing personal matters\u2019 \n\nBut that\u2019s just what I\u2019ve done when I\u2019ve been in these predicaments", "Of course it is, all that dominant/submissive nonsense.
