It's usually just me saying probably not generally because I feel it draws attention or is loud & dont usually dress like that, also I think it just feels sort of possessive over me in a not so good way, but bottom line is I just don't want to & feel like that should be enough explanation when it comes to my own clothing. Most of the time it just ends in her getting a little upset & it getting dropped later, but last night when she asked & I tried to explain my side she got really upset & nearly started crying saying she just wish I would want to wear something like that without any gripes because I love her & wouldn't care what people think. I do love her but I don't believe I'm required to wear a shirt to prove that, it feels a little childish to me. now I feel pressured to wear something I don't really want to wear & don't think that it is necessary for me to wear to show that I love her. Am I the asshole for telling her no when she asks if I would wear the shirt? I feel like I'm not because I should be able to decide what I can & can't wear, but I could be wrong?", "created_utc": 1704746102, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191v991/aita_for_not_wanting_to_wear_an_i_love_my/", "score": 1197, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's an issue in and of itself.", "Tell her you'll wear that only if she wears a t-shirt that says \"I forced my bf to wear this\" with an arrow pointing at the side where you'll be", "'bottom line is I just don't want to & feel like that should be enough explanation when it comes to my own clothing.'\n\nAnd that says it all. \n\nThis is what you want and you've stated what you want and your GF is running roughshod over that and trying to guilt trip you into doing something you don't want to do.\n\nIt's not on.\n\nThis is a hill for you to die on OP. \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nIf your girlfriend needs you to wear a shirt that proclaims your love for her to believe you love her \n\nThere's some deeper issues to be addressed", "NTA. One, it's cringey as hell and really only fun if both of you are wearing it. Two, it's a freaking hypothetical shirt. This is on the same level as the idiots who ask their boyfriends \"Would you still love me if I was a worm?\" or some other nonsense and then get mad at the answer, or someone who gets mad at their boyfriend/husband for something they did in a dream.", "NTA. This sounds like one of those stupid TikTok \"relationship tests\". \n\nYou're absolutely right that you decide what to wear, and she needs to drop this childish nonsense and respect your decision.", "NTA\n\nI would ask for probing questions about WHY it's important to HER. Perhaps she has an unment emotional need that if, rather than giving you this silly hypothetical, she actually talked to you about it you would be able to meet that need in ways that work for both of you and your relationship.\n\nAs it stands, it sounds like she's just upset that you aren't meeting some sort of IG-worthy levels of showing off your love for her. Which, if that's what she truly wants, may require her to find a partner as equally vapid and shallow.", "NTA. You get to choose what to wear. I have very little sympathy for the kinds of \"hypotheticals\" your girlfriend is asking. \"would you love me if I was an octopus??!?\". She's not 13. My husband would die for me, but he would also rather be dead than wear a shirt that says, \"I love my wife\". He doesn't like drawing attention to himself. That's just who he is. I'd be an idiot to let that bother me.", "NTA. Anyone who makes their partner wear an \u201cI love my gf/bf t-shirt is cringey.", "Wait... she asked you multiple times? And you explained your feelings and WHY you don't want to wear that? Assuming this is true, NTA.   \n\n\nI think the tee shirt idea is sweet, but you don't. And your explanation does ring true to me. While I don't feel that way, I can see how a reasonable person would feel that way. It is a bit of a possession thing, to dictate that someone else wear a shirt that tells the world that you love her.   \n\n\nI'm going to be honest here OP, this whole argument is super immature. That she is so attached to you dressing in a certain way to prove your love to her is... really... really \\*young\\* on an emotional level. OK, so you're only 20 and 21. People mature at different rates and some 21  year olds are still very juvenile.   \n\n\nOne thing that is important in mature relationships is that we're able to identify and communicate what helps us feel loved and why. Also, we need to be able to manage our own emotions when we are disappointed in that way. No one's love language is \"tee-shirt.\" But you might want to have some conversations about exactly what helps her feel loved. It's possible that you do have some small a$$holery in this situation. Does she need for you to be more demonstrative about your affection for her? That's something that you should be willing to do - find a way that feels more comfortable for you. Does she feel like you don't tell her that you love her enough? Again, you can find a way that feels authentic to you to do that. Not doing so does make you an AH.... or it makes you an ex BF. Often both of these things. Regardless, refusing the tee does not alone make you an AH.", "NTA. You can love someone without embarrassing yourself with loud empty gestures like this shirt. She should get her priorities right, I don\u2019t see why this should even be an issue.", "NTA. I think there\u2019s some deeper rooted issues here. I\u2019d dismiss the shirt and wonder why she\u2019s feeling that insecure. Maybe she needs a little more affection in general? I\u2019m not saying you are or aren\u2019t affectionate enough but if she\u2019s that distraught over a silly shirt, there\u2019s something else bothering her.", "Nta, If this were the first time this issue came up then maybe there\u2019d at least be some validity in her being upset (you\u2019d still be nta tho), but the fact that she\u2019s asked and keeps pushing it changes that. Your reasoning is more than valid and the fact that she keeps pushing you on a boundary you set can be an issue for a relationship.", "NTA- why can't she buy you a normal shirt that you'd actually want to wear? Why does it HAVE to be a tacky \"I love my girlfriend\" shirt? Sounds like she has some serious jealousy/control issues. Best of luck when you eventually realize how problematic this is!", "NTA someone sounds bit insecure.", "Next question: \"Would you love me if I were a worm?\"", "\rNTA. It's totally okay to have preferences about what you wear, and it doesn't diminish your love for her.

I don\u2019t get the point of these types of tee shirts (or family vacation shirts, hen do/stag do etc etc shirts), I have nothing against people who do like them (before anyone says I do) but I do think you need to ask her why she wants you too? There seems to be an underlying issue", "NTA. Shirts like that are incredibly tacky and her wanting you to wear one reeks of insecurity.", "Nta.\n\n I have some tshirts that I only wear under sweaters or on days when I am puttering at home cleaning, so if I was given a T-shirt I don't like I would add it to that collection.\n\nHowever, if she is asking about the shirt first and wanting to buy it she will probably expect to see you out and about in it, and maybe to tell you when to wear it. That could be a whole second argument.\n\nYou may want to talk about why this matters to her and hear her side. Is she feeling insecure? Does she dislike your clothing tastes? Does she want some \"couples outfits\"?", "NTA that is kind of lame and middle school-ish, and not how you choose to express your affection for her.", "I'd start by addressing the possibility she has abandonment issues or insecurity issues, I feel like a discussion is in order.", "NTA\n\nWhat's she's doing is weird and she's trying to emotionally manipulate you. Is she so insecure that she needs you to wear a shirt saying you love her to prove you love her? What a weird thing to cry about. I don't know, I say run. If she cries and gets upset over something so ridiculous I don't want to imagine how she'll react to actual relationship troubles.", "Dude. You know the \"would you still love me if I was a worm\" trend? It's like that. I know this is obviously much more realistic, and no, I don't think you should say you would if you have no intent to follow through with it, but from what you've shared it seems like she's looking for a particular demonstration of love from you. Without knowing the rest of your life, maybe you're not doing enough right now, maybe she's overly needy, maybe you're current shows of affection just aren't in her love language. No matter what it is, you should sit down and talk to her about it", "NTA \nEw, just ew. \nIf I was seeing someone who wanted me to wear that it would be a dealbreaker much less bringing it up more than once. Seriously ew.", "NTA\n\nBut it does seem like girlfriend wants to do something couple-y like that. Are you looking to be with her long-term? I like to wear matching clothes every once in a while (only the same colors or same shoes, etc). I never got to do anything cheesy or fun in my previous relationships. After I married my husband, I told him that since we're married, that it's the only time I'll ever get to do some of these things. Granted, they're not as obnoxious as an \"I love my girlfriend\" shirt. Maybe you can bring up less cringy ideas as an alternative. \n\nIdk why she gets upset about the hypothetical though. It feels like she's testing her place in your life by pushing your boundaries. Good luck", "NTA I\u2019m trying to give her the benefit of the doubt and hope this is just because she\u2019s young and doesn\u2019t have much experience with relationships (rather than her being entirely possessive and toxic), but regardless the reason there is absolutely no way you are in the wrong here. And it wouldn\u2019t hurt to remind her that those TikToks she\u2019s seeing are solely for likes and views - not how they actually are. And even if some couples do this and both genuinely want to, every couple is different! It doesn\u2019t mean your love is any less real", "NTA. I get the idea of wearing the shirt and I get why she likes the idea, but at the end of the day if she loves you then she would understand if you don't want to wear a specific shirt.\n\n\n\nIf you are open to the idea maybe suggest both of you buy something that matches. For you it is something \"normal\" you like, for her it is then something she can show off her love in if you wear it together.\u200b\u200b\u200b", "NTA. I love my man but I absolutely refused to allow anyone to choose what I wear. I would drop to my knees and suck him off in Walmart, but I'm not wearing a shirt with his face on it.", "Wear it around the house", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nThis is a huge waving red flag that you are being emotionally manipulated.  Look at it this way, would you do this to her?  No?  How would you feel if someone were doing this to a friend?  \n\nJust make it clear that this is childish and makes you feel uncomfortable.  If she loves you, she would want you to be happy.", "NTA, each to their own and your girlfriend needs to respect that. I wouldn't wear anything remotely like this even if bought for me by a partner because the level of cringe this sort of stuff gives me honestly makes me feel like I'm turning inside out. A supportive partner will respect your likes and dislikes, even if it happens to be that you dislike something bought for you by them.", "NTA\n\nAsk her if she needs to pee on you too so no girls will try anything lol.\n\nThose shirts are tacky", "NTA... I love my bf with all of my heart and soul but I wouldn't wear an \"I love my boyfriend\" t-shirt because 1) it comes across kinda obnoxious and 2) I don't really fuck with clothes with writing on it unless it's just a brand logo", "NTA I am a 35 F and my husband is 37 M, we are married and I wouldn\u2019t wear a shirt like that or ask him too. Actually a few years ago he got matching shirts made for us and they said \u201cHer Donald,\u201d \u201cHis Daisy,\u201d it was a reference for Donald & Daisy Duck. We jokingly call each other that as pet names, so he got shirts made of it. I thought it was a very sweet gesture and I wear the shirt around the house or with my sweats here and there. I wouldn\u2019t wear it out in public or ask him to wear his\u2026unless we go to Disney World I guess? Lol idk to each their own but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being an asshole.", "NTA. Her asking this continuously reeks of a \"test\". Like if he loves me enough, he'll do this. Consider if the relationship is lacking in intimacy or other things important to her. She needs to see that asking you to wear this T-shirt is really cringey and immature and use her words to ask for what she really wants in the relationship.", "NTA - shirts like that are tacky and creepy.", "Nta, definitely strangely possessive.\n\ud83d\udea9", "I think shirts like this are tacky. They scream insecurity.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't wear that shirt either.", "NTA. That is beyond cringey.\n\nAsk her if she\u2019s fulfilled with your sex life and if so would she wear an \u2018I heart cock\u2019 t shirt.", "NTA but this is absolutely not about the shirt. She sounds insecure and immature which makes sense considering her age, but maybe you should have a conversation about these feelings and see where it goes from there.", "NTA - that *is* childish of her. Your reasons for not wanting to wear it should be enough. She really needs to let it go and not bring it up again. \n\n\"No, I'm sorry but I've already told you three or four times that it is not something I would want to wear nor should it be in order for me to prove my love for you. I would appreciate it if you would accept no for an answer and respect it enough to not ask me again.\" Period, end of conversation.", "NTA she sounds very insecure, she can\u2019t control what you wear just like you can\u2019t tell her what to wear, plus I\u2019m not sure what style you have but I can\u2019t imagine the shirt looking nice", "NTA.  Clothes shaming is something controlling people do.  People may say what\u2019s the harm but think about it, what if the roles were reversed and you demanded she cover up when she goes out?  Or is forced to always wear a I am property of a man shirt.", "NTA.  No one should make you wear something you aren\u2019t comfortable with.   Seems like she wants you to be a walking billboard that you are taken. \n\nI bought my adult son a tee for Christmas saying he had the most awesome mom in the universe.  I knew he wouldn\u2019t wear it out in public but I couldn\u2019t resist. I smile thinking he\u2019ll probably wear a around the house or use as a dust rag. It was more for me than him and I considered it a gag gift.", "NTA\n\nBecause it has nothing to do with the shirt. Personally I think you should wear the shirt but that isn't why she asked. She felt like some drama so she brought up something contentious. Had you said yes, you brought would have only delayed the crying by a few hours.", "NTA. I'm a woman and that t-shirt sounds cringe.", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to say no. Usually, when someone wants you to do anything out of your comfort zone to \"prove that you love them\" I'd see it as a major red flag. it is extremely manipulative.", "NTA. I like those shirts, I think they\u2019re cute and I would happily wear one if my hypothetical boyfriend asked. But you clearly aren\u2019t comfortable with that, which is entirely and 100% okay. And honestly, you don\u2019t need a reason to not want to wear the shirt. Sure, relationships are about compromise, but also\u2026 it\u2019s a t-shirt? Just get matching rings or necklaces and call it a day, sounds much more your style and still gets the committed point across. \n\nSounds like she just doesn\u2019t understand boundaries, or maybe she\u2019s feeling a little insecure about your standing in a relationship. I wouldn\u2019t jump straight to \u201cshe\u2019s controlling and possessive\u201d like some people on here would, but it\u2019s definitely a conversation to be had. I mean\u2026 why DOES it matter so much to her?", "Eww man no, respect yourself. She's an adult behaving like this? Yikes.\n\nNTA", "NTA - She needs to respect your boundary on it. It doesn't need an explanation as to why, your no should be enough. Maybe she should focus more on how you treat her, than how she wants to dress you. \n\nMen don't tend to look at clothing like that as cute. It's uncomfortable, it draws attention and frankly, it's more than a little possessive since she's the one asking you to do it. Not like it was your idea.\n\nI think you should put your foot down and tell her this isn't acceptable behavior from her. No should be enough and she should respect you enough to stop. Actions matter, and her actions aren't saying very good things right now.", "NTA, I have no other words. I know my husband loves me, but I'm not going to ask him to wear a shirt that announces it. Seems clingy to me.", "NTA. She wants you to wear it because getting \"I have a girlfriend\" tattooed on your forehead would be much more expensive. Seriously though, it's literally her stamping you as belonging to her and serves as a warning to other women who may try to steal you away. Your gf is insecure. Does she have any real reason to think that's what might happen when she's not around? Are you a bit of a flirt or is it insecurity/paranoia? I'm sure you show her that you love her in plenty of other ways so I'd be considering gently asking if there's a deeper reason she wants you to wear this t-shirt if I were in your shoes.", "Do you hold her hand, hug her, and give her an occasional quick kiss in public? And are you happy for people to assume that you're a couple?\n\nIf so, then I've got absolutely no idea what will make this girl happy lol.", "NTA\n\nThis is deep cringe\n\nThe idea is cringe\n\nThe argument is cringe", "I vote not the asshole", "Nta, but why don't you both talk about why your gf really want that? (Insecurities maybe?) And maybe both of you could wear some kind of accessories that reminds you of each other, like a collar or something meaningful.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nWhy should you wear something you don't want to & why does she keep bringing it up?\n\nMaybe it's genuine insecurity but it feels like an  attempt at being controlling imo.", "NTA, I can fully empathise with every single thing you say.", "NTA\n\nShe's really insecure and wants the attention of people knowing that you're hers.", "She sounds immature & possessive. If this is how she gets over a t-shirt, I\u2019d hate to see what she does if you decided to have female friends or pick the movie one night\u2026 \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude43 NTA. Sounds like she needs to grow up, or you need to get out\u2026 or both.", "NTA. Get her a t-shirt that says \"I like to please my boyfriend sexually\". It might give her perspective.\n\nEdit: Ok that might be a little over the top. Maybe go and get a shirt that says \n\n\" I currently love my girlfriend.\"", "NTA. She\u2019s acting like a child and creating conflict for no reason. Also, it\u2019s not about what other people think. It\u2019s about what you think. Clearly she doesn\u2019t care about that. Seems like she\u2019s trying to see how much she can get away with. How much you\u2019re willing to debase yourself and set aside your own comfort and dignity just to appease her. She figures if she complains enough, guilts you enough, etc., maybe you\u2019ll give in and she\u2019ll win and know she can make you do anything through emotional manipulation.", "NTA. She sounds incredibly insecure.", "Speaking hypothetically for your friends, we will make fun of you for wearing this. Not a little, but rather a lot.\n\nWe will give you all the grief. It will not stop. We will buy you T-shirts that say this long after you have broken up with her. It will be your only birthday present.

You don't have to do anything you don't want to do but maybe try sending flowers to her work. Or Maybe buy a matching pajama set with matching goofy looking cups.

I'd just have to.", "NTA this is the gateway drug to matching outfits.", "With the way she's reacting, it seems like your girlfriend wants the world to think she controls you and is upset she's not getting her way like all the influencers online convincing their husbands to wear that garbage.

The sticking point about why social media is so toxic is the familiarity with the people. Reddit being anonymous is a different beast in a way that matters.", "does that count as an oxymoron? \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nah, judgment: OP is NTA", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Well, if that's a case, I can say that the OP needs to find a different partner and I am 100% about that. Not because any of those two people are bad or anything, just because they don't along and won't get along in the long run. Partner won't try finding common ground and won't take no for an answer as much, as OP won't also do so. I think there's a lot more bigger picture to that than we will ever be able to know and that situation is not actually about a shirt, but more about how they don't accept each others points of view in general\n\nBecause like damn, this whole thing would've been resolved with some communication- \nIt's basically as if the OP was getting pancakes for breakfast just because the partner loves them, while OP hates them. And instead of working on that, partner continues making pancakes because \"they taste so good\" and OP just goes to write an angry reddit post, getting a tons of comments \"yeah you are right she's bad!\" \n\nThis whole situation is just lmao", "I\u2019ve posted this more than once because they said the exact same thing. Why would I reply differently to identical replies? That\u2019s also not the slam dunk response you think it is. \nRegardless of you second point, I can assure you that woman\u2019s social life was vastly different than OP and his GFs at that age. In the older ladies younger life, absolutely nothing compares to the influence of modern social media. She would\u2019ve never experienced the pressure of trends by millions of people in the same WAY(mind you, in the same WAY) that younger generations do. It\u2019s very different and incomparable in so many ways. \nQuit being a clown, you know exactly what I mean.", "I didn\u2019t say social media wasn\u2019t around, I said the effects that it had were not even remotely comparable to the stupid shit you see on platforms like TikTok today", "It\u2019s not wrong but I\u2019m glad people around you are using social media less. Just remember social media isn\u2019t just instagram and facebook.", "Actually nowadays they say people are more influenced by sites like Reddit and tik tok. Facebook has fallen to the boomers so no young people use it. Instagram is slowly dying because it\u2019s completely run by people trying to make money or show off. Less engagement. I\u2019d argue Reddit may be the worst. Lots of places to say your opinion and have lots of people backing it up. Problem is the conversations aren\u2019t natural. They are swayed into a direction by whoever is pulling the strings. I may have sounded rude saying that lady is out of touch but if your main advice is to get off social media, take it all the way then cuz all of this shit sucks.", "She wants him to wear something stupid in front of other people, he wants her to wear something sexy in front of him. No, they're not equivalent. His request would actually be reasonable.", "Yuck... Use as leverage in the future? Feel bad for anyone who has the displeasure of being your partner.", "Wrap it up everyone, this person is the authority on everyone else\u2019s life experience. I\u2019ve been assured they know everything regarding social media, popular culture through the decades, and good old fashioned peer pressure.", "So 45yos are \u201clittle old ladies\u201d nowadays?\n\nYeah yeah, I know that's not __exactly__ what you wrote \u2013 I'm neither blind nor illiterate \u2013 but it sure as fuck sounds hella like it.\n\n45yos being just barely adults, people who call them \u201colder ladies\u201d are obviously nowhere near that.", "No, we got all the stupid shit we did from our friends in person. Y'all are acting like peer pressure was invented in Y2K", "I saw a bitch shit a fish on xanga, nothing else I've ever seen on any other social media has been more stupid than that. You're right, not even comparable.", "Yeah\u2026 that\u2019s a bit different. Not sure how you can\u2019t understand that, it isn\u2019t that hard. Here, let me sum it up: TikTok is a new low, the likes of which we as a species have yet to witness up until this point", "Then clearly you\u2019ve never been on TikTok"]}
