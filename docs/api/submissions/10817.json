But I've only spent ~$150 on weed in the last year. I smoke one or two tiny bowls in the evenings but only after I'm done with work, gym, and chores/errands for the day. I sometimes take edibles on weekends. I do it because I like being high, but also because I lift weights + run 5 days a week and need to eat at least 4000 calories/day to maintain my weight. Weed gives me the appetite to eat \"clean\" instead of eating less filling junk. \n\nMy gf (25F) doesn't like that I use weed and has asked that I quit a few times. She's worried because it's unhealthy and that it might impact my career. But I have a great job that pays really well and I'm good at it despite my weed habits. I also take my health very seriously. Weed and occasional binge drinking are my only vices but I work out often, eat super healthy, drink tons of water, sleep at least 7 hrs a night, and never get sick. \n\n\nMy gf has a key to my place and stays with me the majority of the week because she has housemates. Yesterday I got home from the gym to find her and two of her friends Alice and Tina sitting at my dining table with my weed and bong. Alice and Tina start into a spiel about my \"problem\" while my gf sits quiety looking sad. It was the same stuff about how it's bad for me, bad for my career, one of our mutual friends who also smokes a lot was laid off earlier this week, etc. \n\nI'm chuckling through the whole thing. Once they were done I tried to explain that my career and health are both doing well. At that point, Alice says \"sorry but this has to happen [name]\" and gets up to throw my bong in the trash. At this point I get mad and I snatch my bong from Alice. I tell them I'm not going to let myself get lectured about my \"problem\" by three women who binge drink at least once a week. Especially not by someone like Alice who does ket or coke whenever she drinks and has an actual substance problem. And my gf who gets sick every other week is not an authority on health. \n\nAt this point Tina tells me \"keep ruining your life you fucking addict\" and they get up to leave as my gf is crying. I asked my gf weed was really the problem but she just kept crying. Before they left, I told my gf that when she's ready to talk she can reach out and she nodded. \n\nMy gf just texted me asking if she could come over and talk. I haven't responded yet.

I've seen first hand how emotionally addictive it is from people who say they are totally in control while they smoke every day, lose jobs and then break into a coin washing machine just to buy a little more because they can't deal with life without being high.  It was part of what broke my family.  It's not always the harmless fun people think it is.  With that context in mind, since I want to make it very clear that I'm not someone who leaps to say how great pot is, I'd still say NTA.\n\nYou've mentioned she often issues \"that or me\" questions and now has brought in her busybody friends, some of whom you have pointed out are being entirely hypocritical and use illegal drugs, into the issue.  She's being controlling and honestly it doesn't seem like you truly would be happy quitting just because she demanded it.  An intervention is people who actually care about you giving actual examples of how you've harmed your bonds with people and quality of life and all they could say was \"maybe x will happen\", \"perhaps y could happen\".\n\nIf you girlfriend truly can't accept that you do this for enjoyment, even though you say it's caused no harm to your life or profession she just doesn't like it, then the relationship had probably run it's course.  If you aren't telling the truth about your habit, then the situation is still the same.  The consequences are yours alone to handle.  It's not up to her to command you to stop.  The only option she has is to decide whether she is willing to stay with you if she's truly that opposed to it.  That is the only reasonable course of action.\n\nIt's okay for a relationship to end because you have views that can't coexist.  Staying together while both sides resent each other over a disagreement until one gives in to placate the other isn't going to end up in a happy or healthy place.", "NAH. But only if you really don\u2019t have a problem. Your GF and you might not be compatible. I personally don\u2019t view a hit or two a night as any different than a glass of wine or a beer.

You two clearly need to talk because obviously it\u2019s affecting you relationship.", "Not necessarily an AH but depending on where you work, they do drug testing and people do get fired for failing a drug test for weed. It happens. My husband's job is one of them where they do random drug tests every so often on all of the employees. My husband doesn't touch the stuff because it makes him sick but he is ok with me taking edibles on occasion for my stomach issues which helps tremendously. I just eat one as needed usually when I'm about to eat so my food doesn't come back up. Weed is better for your health in moderation just as alcohol is good for your health in moderation. What isn't healthy with anything is too much of anything. If your gf can't understand that then your relationship isn't going to work and these issues are just going to escalate. You are both just not compatible. Find someone you are compatible with and make sure it's not a deal breaker ahead of time.", "NAH. You and your girlfriend are incompatible on the topic of weed use. Quit wasting each other's time.\n\nNot sure how long you have been dating, or whether it was completely clear to her that you are an *everyday* smoker (and in the house too, ugh!). Be certain the next potential girlfriend has the facts.", "NAH. It doesn\u2019t sound like you have a problem so the whole intervention thing sounds ridiculous. But at the same time, I empathise with your GF. It\u2019s always been important to me that my partner not be a regular consumer of drugs of any sort (including weed). I think weed is harmless and used to smoke up myself many years ago but this is how I feel now. It\u2019s the same as not wanting to be with a smoker, for instance. \n\nI think you should speak to her. If this is a dealbreaker for her and you can\u2019t give up weed then the relationship has no future. If she can reconcile with the fact that you smoke weed and it\u2019s fine by her, then you guys can find a way. Or if you like her enough to give it up for her.\n\nThe way I see it, those are the only 3 options you guys have. So figure out which one it is through conversation and then move ahead.", "It's legal in my country but I'm not a fan, at all.\n\nETA ... Your GF shouldn't be discussing it with the ambush help of her friends.  This is a you and her issue.\n\nYou shouldn't be justifying your behavior based entirely upon the others being hypocritical.  What they do has nothing to do with what you do.  That they're hypocritical in ambushing you is something you can take issue with, but it doesn't let you off the hook.\n\nObviously this is a big issue for your GF.  Whether or not it is truly affecting your daily life is something that only you can establish. But it's certainly effecting your relationship.  What you might want to figure out is WHY she believes it's effecting your life, or if it's a fear for the future. And only the two of you can determine if this is a deal breaker.", "It depends. I\u2019m not getting enough info about your weed use. Do you smoke while you are driving, for example? Do you lie to your partner about you weed use? \n\nAnyway, probably wouldn\u2019t handle it like your girlfriend did, but I wouldn\u2019t date you either.

I sometimes take edibles on weekends. I do it because I like being high, but also because I lift weights + run 5 days a week and need to eat at least 4000 calories/day to maintain my weight. Weed gives me the appetite to eat \"clean\" instead of eating less filling junk. \n\nMy gf (25F) doesn't like that I use weed and has asked that I quit a few times. She's worried because it's unhealthy and that it might impact my career. But I have a great job that pays really well and I'm good at it despite my weed habits. I also take my health very seriously. Weed and occasional binge drinking are my only vices but I work out often, eat super healthy, drink tons of water, sleep at least 7 hrs a night, and never get sick. \n\n\nMy gf has a key to my place and stays with me the majority of the week because she has housemates. Yesterday I got home from the gym to find her and two of her friends Alice and Tina sitting at my dining table with my weed and bong. Alice and Tina start into a spiel about my \"problem\" while my gf sits quiety looking sad. It was the same stuff about how it's bad for me, bad for my career, one of our mutual friends who also smokes a lot was laid off earlier this week, etc. \n\nI'm chuckling through the whole thing. Once they were done I tried to explain that my career and health are both doing well. At that point, Alice says \"sorry but this has to happen [name]\" and gets up to throw my bong in the trash. At this point I get mad and I snatch my bong from Alice. I tell them I'm not going to let myself get lectured about my \"problem\" by three women who binge drink at least once a week. Especially not by someone like Alice who does ket or coke whenever she drinks and has an actual substance problem. And my gf who gets sick every other week is not an authority on health. \n\nAt this point Tina tells me \"keep ruining your life you fucking addict\" and they get up to leave as my gf is crying. I asked my gf weed was really the problem but she just kept crying. Before they left, I told my gf that when she's ready to talk she can reach out and she nodded. \n\nMy gf just texted me asking if she could come over and talk. I haven't responded yet.

I feel like this situation is largely an outcome of a lack of education on her end. \n\nAdditionally, her friends are also in the wrong, especially by calling you a \"fucking addict\", which...doesn't seem to be the case at all for you. \n\nOP, perhaps laughing at them wasn't the best idea, but you're definitely NTA.
