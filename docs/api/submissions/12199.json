Basically to make a 2 year long story short (I\u2019ve posted most of the story elsewhere). My Mil has stolen money, lies about money, and doesn\u2019t respect my husband or myself at all. She is extremely controlling and lies her way out of any situation and uses your trust to manipulate any trick you to get what she wants. If that doesn\u2019t work she will bully you to get what she wants. Anyways we have finally kicked her out of our finances and taken control of our lives from her. \n\nTo my surprise after everything she\u2019s done my husband wants to give her our sons SSN. I refuse because I don\u2019t want him to have the same problems with her control tactics. He claims she only wants it to open a bank account for a college fund. What my husband seems to forget is that there has to be an adult on the account until he is old enough. Another reason I don\u2019t want her having his personal information is she\u2019s known to steal. She has already stolen thousands from me personally before I was even engaged to him. (No I didn\u2019t run, my dads just as toxic and I love my husband too much to let her ruin it) I don\u2019t feel comfortable with her being able to ruin our sons credit. I don\u2019t trust her and my husband agrees she has stolen, lies, and messed us up financially but he is mad at me about our sons information. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m an ass here I just want to protect my son from her manipulation. I feel like my husband is giving into her pressure again even though we finally got her out of our financials after two years of arguing about it. I don\u2019t understand how he can agree she\u2019s a thief and lier but turn around and give her the same access to our baby boy. \n\nI just feel like if she really is genuine about a college fund then we can open an account for him ourselves and let her send checks for us to put in/ transfer money to it without her name on it or having his SSN. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let my lying thief of a MIL have my sons SSN?", "created_utc": 1678715363, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11qa8uh/aita_for_refusing_to_give_inlaws_sons_ssn/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Plus unless she\u2019s going to fully fund college giving the kid a college fund may screw him out of financial aid later on.  I used to work for a student loan lender and servicer and having his own money could make him an eligible for grants and subsidized loans, so if she\u2019s only going to put a couple thousand dollars in there tell her to keep it and put it towards his car when he\u2019s 16 or something. \n\nI wanted to make my youngest brother the beneficiary on my bank accounts so if anything happens to me they get paid directly to him, they don\u2019t have to be in probate, creditors can\u2019t get them, etc. I needed his Social Security number for the beneficiary form and he didn\u2019t want to give it to me, he has no reason not to trust me but he\u2019s being smart and I can respect that. \n\nSo what I did is I filled out the form completely except for his social, I brought it to my bank and I asked the lady I gave the form to if he can call them and give them his Social Security number directly and they were fine with that, she gave me her card with her direct extension And I sent it to him and asked him to please call that day well she had the form on her desk so she could finish processing it, and he did. I don\u2019t have his Social Security number but the bank could do what they had to do. \n\nYour husband is being ridiculous, if this woman can\u2019t even manage her own money she has no business opening a college savings account for your child.

She has no need to open an account on her own. Strongly suggest you get in the habit of researching anything she tries to tell you about money and just being more aware of how finances and banking works - it\u2019s a lot harder for her to scam you if you aren\u2019t counting on her for information.

Is she is worried that if she sends you money specifically meant for her grandson's college fund you will spend it on something else and not deposit it?  \nI would be leary of giving her your son's SSN if she really that bad with money, but the solution is pretty simple.\n\nYour MIL should talk to a financial advisor to find out if there is a method for saving this money for her grandson in an account of her own without risk of penalty for withdrawing in 18+ years.

There is absolutely no reason why she needs that information and your solution of opening an account that she can deposit money into is perfect. Her history speaks against her.
