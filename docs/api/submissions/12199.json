She is extremely controlling and lies her way out of any situation and uses your trust to manipulate any trick you to get what she wants. If that doesn\u2019t work she will bully you to get what she wants.

I refuse because I don\u2019t want him to have the same problems with her control tactics. He claims she only wants it to open a bank account for a college fund. What my husband seems to forget is that there has to be an adult on the account until he is old enough. Another reason I don\u2019t want her having his personal information is she\u2019s known to steal. She has already stolen thousands from me personally before I was even engaged to him. (No I didn\u2019t run, my dads just as toxic and I love my husband too much to let her ruin it) I don\u2019t feel comfortable with her being able to ruin our sons credit. I don\u2019t trust her and my husband agrees she has stolen, lies, and messed us up financially but he is mad at me about our sons information. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m an ass here I just want to protect my son from her manipulation. I feel like my husband is giving into her pressure again even though we finally got her out of our financials after two years of arguing about it.

I feel sorry that you choose that family for your child.\n\nEdit: oh shit I just read you are 20. No wonder your an idiot. You got pregnant before you can even have a drink. Where are you from Alabama?", "I wish I could upvote this a thousand times!", "Yea I know she\u2019s narcissistic unfortunately my husband doesn\u2019t see that part of it. Mainly because he knows my dad is one but doesn\u2019t see his mom as being as bad as my dad. Even though she\u2019s doing the exact same thing on a larger scale and didn\u2019t stop when he moved out like mine did.", "Fortunately she is unemployed however she does my husbands taxes (my next battle with him). I\u2019m trying to take everything one at a time. I know I can\u2019t convince him to change everything all at once and have to take baby steps. So far everything we have given her to turn in I have put in envelopes and glues them closed. I know it won\u2019t stop her if she really wants in them but I\u2019ve been praying it would deter her.", "He\u2019s surprisingly not and I\u2019d go so far as to say he hates her as much as I do. His thing is he craves his dad\u2019s approval and his dad enables his mother. He also hates conflict and never stands up for himself against anyone. I\u2019ve had to take over multiple disagreements with deals, employers, and employees. Most of the time acting on his behalf as if I was him.", "I am nc with my in laws and lc with my dad and step mom. I only deal with them because he\u2019s keeping my horses for me because in laws keep trying to force me to sell them.", "We\u2019ve put our foot down with in-laws and given them very strict guidelines to follow when dealing with us because of other issues. Money is just the tip of things they have done. For some reason despite agreeing she has caused so many issues and isn\u2019t trustworthy he wants to give it to her. And I\u2019ve begged for counseling ever since I had the baby because with ppd I couldn\u2019t run from all my emotions or continue them anymore. He refuses.", "I think he wants to give her the benefit of the doubt/ not have to argue with her about why she isn\u2019t getting it. He hates conflict so he tends to give in to pressure", "Yes, the MIL likely intends to take out money in the kid's name. This happened to a cousin of mine and it never got fixed, they ended up having to pay it off as an adult and nothing happened to the parent that did this.", "[removed]", "Mommas boy", "529 does need a child\u2019s SSN to open, but in your case I wouldn\u2019t provide it to your MIL. If she wants to contribute to a 529 she can make contributions to the one that you open FBO of your child.", "Simple solution, OP opens the 529 or ESA and MIL can deposit into it without having any control of the account or the SSN.", "Its a bit to the side of the issue, but for a straight savings account, wouldn't the taxes be assessed yearly rather than a hit upon withdrawal? Since the money has NOT been sitting in a tax free environment for 18 years, wouldn't the interest be taxed annually rather than treated like a capital gain to be taxed at the end?", "Don't underestimate your husband. If MIL pressures him enough, he may very well find that number and give it to her.", "He doesn't see after all she's done? You have a husband problem. Tell him explicitly why you won't. Remind him of all she has done. Tell her that you don't need a ssn for a bank account and because of the past you won't be giving her one. Just no. The same to your husband.", "If she does your taxes again, she will get you son's social security number that way, unless you fill his SSN in last after she's done putting together the return and file yourself.", "You may want to draw a hard line in the sand with your husband regarding this. Is this really how you want to live the rest of your life? Your husband recognizes all the awful things his family has done yet is still siding with them. The fact that your husband would even consider this is ludicrous.", "How this can even happen in modern country...", "How is that even possible? I'm not saying I don't believe you, but how is it possible that your country's banking system is that broken that you can borrow money in the name of an infant, and have that loan default and it be the infant's problem?", "Yea not going to happen. Unlike some people we believe in working through our problems instead of running from them. But if you want to assume we are \u201cthings I shouldn\u2019t say\u201d that\u2019s fine. Not sure how our relationship has to do with protecting my kid\u2019s identity? If we split nothing\u2019s stopping him from giving her access so how would getting a \u201csecond dad\u201d protect my son.", "We froze the credit for our two children. It just makes sense.", "I plan on putting it in my lockbox tomorrow morning after his doctors appointment.", "I am making the office call me to get the number after everything else is handed in", "I don't know, I don't go looking for ways to scam kids. But it happens all the time, just look at all the people in this thread suggesting a credit freeze.", "Yes, do this ASAP. I've had far to many clients who have tried to get their start in life only to find out their toxic parent defaulted on loans, owed thousands or more to utilities but it was all under their SSN. And guess what, being able to prove you were a minor doesn't unf**k your credit, even if you pursue ID theft and fraud charges", "OP should freeze her account too and her husband's if he will let her. I feel bad for the husband, he can't accept how self-centered and untrustworthy his mom is, but they all need to protect themselves from grandma.", "Do this. Start an account yourself and invite her to put money in it.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019ve asked him but he just says \u201cthen he won\u2019t have one\u201d", "He won't have one, regardless! It's a scam. NTA", "Open a 529. Grandparents can contribute to it without being in control of any of the funds. \n\nhttps://www.savingforcollege.com/article/can-a-grandparent-contribute-to-a-parent-owned-529-plan"]}
