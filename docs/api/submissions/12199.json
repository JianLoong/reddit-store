She is extremely controlling and lies her way out of any situation and uses your trust to manipulate any trick you to get what she wants. If that doesn\u2019t work she will bully you to get what she wants.

I refuse because I don\u2019t want him to have the same problems with her control tactics. He claims she only wants it to open a bank account for a college fund. What my husband seems to forget is that there has to be an adult on the account until he is old enough. Another reason I don\u2019t want her having his personal information is she\u2019s known to steal. She has already stolen thousands from me personally before I was even engaged to him. (No I didn\u2019t run, my dads just as toxic and I love my husband too much to let her ruin it) I don\u2019t feel comfortable with her being able to ruin our sons credit. I don\u2019t trust her and my husband agrees she has stolen, lies, and messed us up financially but he is mad at me about our sons information. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m an ass here I just want to protect my son from her manipulation. I feel like my husband is giving into her pressure again even though we finally got her out of our financials after two years of arguing about it.
