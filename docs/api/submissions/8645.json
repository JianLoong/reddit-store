Essentially she believes that she has a say in everything since they\u2019re her children. We do love her, but she can be a lot. Lots of unsolicited advice, pushy opinions, etc\u2026 \n\nWe started to notice that she has been extremely gossipy - particularly about things that should not be shared. For example, we were told of a cousins pregnancy having birth defects but were told not to tell anyone because she wasn\u2019t supposed to tell anyone. Another cousin was pregnant and ultimately miscarried, but this wasn\u2019t announced so we\u2019ve had to act like we don\u2019t know. Another cousin got pregnant but didn\u2019t want anyone to know as it was early, her mom told my MIL (her SIL) and my MIL told us, again we were told to act like we didn\u2019t know. Luckily everything is on track with that one. \n\nI mentioned that I hoped that when the day came for me to announce my own pregnancy, she would not tell others as it\u2019s something that my husband and I should enjoy and do ourselves. She said \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, because no one would tell you they already knew so it would be just as special to you\u201d. \n\nI realized then and there that nothing we could do or say would prevent her from spreading the word before we were ready, and my husband agreed.\n\nNow we have found that we\u2019re expecting our first, and we\u2019re very excited. We are only 6 weeks into the pregnancy. I expressed a desire to not tell his mother until 12 weeks, and that I\u2019d essentially like to tell her and then posit it online within the hour. He was okay with that plan.\n\nHowever, I do want to tell my 2 sisters and my mother and father. They are extremely supportive people and I want to share this time with them. I would never worry about them telling anyone. He thinks that it would be wrong to tell my family and not his own, and his mother would never forgive us (me really). I said that his mothers inability to stop gossiping shouldn\u2019t prevent me from sharing with my family. I also said that he can tell his sister if he would like, as I know for a fact she will keep it a secret from her mom (she shared many of the same concerns).\n\nHe said this is asking for problems because his mom will inevitably find out later that everyone knew before her. I agree that she will likely find that out, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s our problem and she should understand why we kept it from her. His father would never side with us to keep the peace but definitely understands why we would do this. \n\nWIBTA for hiding this from his mother but telling others in our family?", "created_utc": 1675035042, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10om7rf/wibta_for_hiding_my_pregnancy_from_my_mil/", "score": 220, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

An information diet is entirely appropriate for her.", "NTA. Tell your family and don't feel guilty. When MIL finds out that everyone knew before her, just tell her honestly that she has made it clear that she can't keep a secret and therefore the consequence is she will not be the first to know things. That's on her, not you or anyone else.", "She told you that she wouldn't keep the pregnancy a secret. I applaud the self-awareness, but choices like that have consequences. \n\nI've had to inform friends and family about my pregnancy losses before and it is EXTREMELY hard, especially when you go through it multiple times. It's understandable that you wouldn't want to have to face that on a broader scale, which telling your MIL would guarantee.\n\nThat's why I'm voting NTA. People who can't keep secrets can't be surprised when they are cut out of the loop.", "NTA. Both of you agree that it\u2019s the MIL that will spread gossip, it\u2019s not all of your husband\u2019s side. It wouldn\u2019t be great if your MIL found out that she was the last to know, but these are the consequences of her actions.", "NTA - but please read OP.\n\nIf you need that support group, then you have a responsibility to that little babe and yourself to get that support without the worry of the announcement spreading. \n\nHowever, if this isn\u2019t about the support (although I think it is) it certainly would be more of a good compromise to hold off. \n\nI would present this to your husband in terms of support that you need. Do not explain it as something that seems vindictive or even protective. \n\nIf she finds out, he\u2019ll just have to be blunt with his mother and explain she has some loose lips. You\u2019ve presented this as a one off personality flaw. Hopefully the better parts of her personality help her to correct herself if it comes to that.\n\nWhat\u2019s going to cause you less stress? Waiting to tell everyone? Or telling one side of the family with some possibility that your mil figures it out - and your husband then has to tell her she drops the tea on her loved ones too much and it makes him uncomfortable? \n\nWhatever causes you less stress during your pregnancy is what you do. This is all about getting through this as healthy as possible and not her.\n\nEdit: is having your husband sit her down and explaining to her to not be shit about a secret an option? It doesn\u2019t sound like it would be practical. But probably worth asking since you deal with her.", "NTA.

Her reputation has caused this, she made her bed.", "NTA.  Learn to \"grey rock\" MIL.  (you can look up the term).  MIL is a boundary stomper.  You need to have a serious discussion with your husband.  You two have to be on the same page when it comes to relating anything about your relationship, your health, your children.  He has to agree to keep MIL at bay.  \n\nPerhaps you could have a get-together with your family, MIL and SIL and tell them all at the same time.\n\nYou might want to go to r/JUSTNOMIL for more advice.", "Nta - she's proven time and time again that she can not be trusted.

If I've learned anything from the baby groups I'm in is once the pregnancy news leaves you and your husband, it isn't safe.

This is also your husband's baby so you need to be on the same page.  It's his mom and he should be managing that relationship...I don't think it's fair to put him in that position unless he is 100% on board.

OP\u2019s husband is concerned that his mother would be hurt, however not taking into consideration that his mother would hurt them by sharing news that isn\u2019t hers to tell. Maybe this will be a lesson to MIL that something are best kept to herself.", "It's not in the least hypocritical to trust a trustworthy person with info you would not entrust to an incorrigible gossip, your husband is comparing apples to orangutans here. You have not put your husband in an uncomfortable position, his mother has, and he has allowed her to do so.", "It is just a really unfortunate situation she\u2019s put you both in.

Particularly if her husband cares. Unless the inlaws are absolutely shit people, in general, a good policy is to let your partner handle them. That also means deferring to their judgement and also strategizing about how much bs you and they are willing to deal with..it's more about considering if the shit she will put them through is worth it.", "I saw that you deleted your most recent comment, but I\u2019ll respond either way.\n\nHe was the one to confront his mom when we started trying and he came to me to say we can\u2019t tell her because he knows she won\u2019t keep it a secret.

No skin off his back.", "My husband is an amazing man who has stood by me through thick and thin. He has stood up to his mother on multiple occasions, and when she rises to the occasion he rises back. However, he is not an overly confrontational person and believes in diffusing situations whenever possible and when it\u2019s not truly going to help to put your foot down. Me throwing her words back at her, while fun, would not actually be helpful. I\u2019m the type to do it anyways. I\u2019ve also been fired for not holding my tongue, caused rifts with my sisters when we were younger for cutting remarks, and regretted many enjoyable comebacks later on. My husband is in no way an asshole, but a kind and generous man who tries to do right by everyone in his life.", "She has basically said time and time again that she sees no issue with telling, as long as the original person never find out that everyone else knew.

I probably would tell everyone. It's not about letting him control what you do with your family but making decisions about everything together. Who you tell, when and why... It might make sense to wait on telling his mom until you are ready to tell everyone, but maybe that means telling everyone early. There are so many moving parts, but all decisions should be made together. Not his family and my family, but now, this is YOUR family.  This is your child's grandparent for better or worse and do you really want to start off a baby announcement with all the drama? It's not about him being controlling but trying to problem solve and find a solution that works for both of you. When to announce the baby to anyone should be a joint decision.", "Oh she\u2019ll definitely be upset that we waited until 12 weeks to tell her, that\u2019s a given that my husband has accepted. It\u2019s just the she\u2019ll blow up if she realized we told others weeks before. I personally don\u2019t have an issue with it - blow up for all I care. However my husband is worried about the fallout.", "Neither of us want her to know until 12 weeks, and I want the support of my family before then. I am aware that she is my family, and I do love her, but I also do not have any interest in having the entire world know that I\u2019m pregnant at 7/8 weeks. \n\nHe understands my need for support, he is only worried about the fall out. If his mom causes issues and is upset that she wasn\u2019t told early, perhaps she needs to look at herself and realize that she\u2019s lost her families trust. I for one know that each cousin who\u2019s stories of miscarriage, loss, rape, and abuse that I\u2019ve heard would be mortified to know that their business is out there for the entire family.", "I\u2019ve heard choosing anger over resentment is better. You will resent her forever and that will lead to contempt. There\u2019s no relationship after that. \n\nYour DH wants to believe in who he wants her to be, and not who she IS. That\u2019s your biggest issue here. Don\u2019t tell her until you\u2019re ready for the world to know.", "Ugh. She really can't keep a secret, even important ones that are really bad. (I get not keeping a pregnancy announcement a secret due to excitement or sharing with a few close friends. It sucks, but understandable, and not horrific).  I still think you and your husband need to figure out a plan together. Dealing with the fallout is always an option (,so is telling everyone now, including Facebook.. I get a lot of people wait til 12 weeks, so that may be a hard limit).  Good luck!", "So I feel like some people missed it and it\u2019s probably my fault! My husband is 100% behind not telling her, that was his idea. He knows that she can\u2019t be trusted not to tell everyone, even if we were to beg. He just wants us to not tell anyone because he\u2019s worried that when she inevitably finds out, it\u2019ll cause major fall out and he wants to avoid that.", "Yeah, it\u2019s unfortunate. She will share anything and everything with everyone. You could tell her your greatest heartache and beg her to keep it to herself, but 5 people will know within the hour. \n\nI have reasons to worry about a miscarriage, and I\u2019m not interested in having the entire world know if that happens. However, that\u2019s the reason that I want the support of my sisters and mother.", "Yeah, punishing everyone else because he doesn\u2019t want to stand up to his mom?? YOU can\u2019t get the family support you want and need because he\u2019s afraid his mom will be upset. That\u2019s the issue to be addressed. He\u2019s afraid to upset mommy, to hell with what HIS WIFE needs.", "NTA. He is essentially asking you to punish yourself and your family because of his mom\u2019s bad behavior. That is not fair. \n\nIt sucks that his mom refuses to keep a secret. It sucks that she will blow up if she finds out that others knew before her. But none of that is your fault. \n\nI would argue that you don\u2019t even have different standards for your families. The standard is that you expect everyone will keep your pregnancy a secret until you are ready to announce. Your MIL has refused to follow that standard, my guess is that your family would happily agree. Same rule, but you can\u2019t control who is willing to follow it. \n\nYou are about to become a mom. This will not be the last time that you will want to reach out to your family for support and advise, that your husband is not willing to share with his mom. Is the expectation that you will never be able to reach out to them because your husband doesn\u2019t want to deal with his mother\u2019s reaction to the consequence of her choices?", "NTA. And if any of your in-laws question why you didn't tell her earlier? \"I've heard a lot of stories about the family that I've had to keep quiet because she wasn't supposed to tell anybody. I didn't want my news to be like that, and I didn't want everyone to have to fake being surprised.\"\n\nLet them make of it what they will.", "NTA if you really feel compelled to tell your family, they aren't the ones that have caused problems and spilled secrets.", "NTA- and as a warning, get ready to have some strict boundaries with MIL if you don\u2019t want to know/share the sex of the baby or their name before they are born. She sounds like the type of grandparent who thinks they have a right to that information.", "I would honestly tell her after the 20 week mark when you pass the miscarriage mark and that the baby is developed enough to seen if there are any health risks to prepare for since she has no filter and loves the gossip. I would also tell you to coordinate with your family to launch that fb post as you are informing mil just so she doesn\u2019t blab before you do. NTA", "Your husband is being a huge fucking baby by being to afraid to stand up to his mommy because she can't keep her damn mouth shut. Is this how you want the rest of your life to be? Because stuff like this is going to keep happening unless he puts on his big boy pants.", "NTA\n Tell your family.  If she find out you told your family.  Tell her. It doesn't matter because they are going to pretend they did not know anyways Back at you. Then act all innocent when she gets mad.", "This is too complicated. YTA for thinking you can tell 5+ people and not have the secret get out to MIL somehow. If you're telling THAT many people you might as well tell everyone. Petty af.", "NTA. This is the price she pays for being a gossip who can\u2019t be trusted with a secret.", "NTA. My rule of thumb is that I tell the people who's support I'll need in the event of a miscarriage. Everyone else waits until 16 weeks. Of course I have brutal morning sickness so people figure it out sooner if they're around me, but that's a different problem.", "NTA -- the problem is that this situation is being treated as though you are doing something \"to\" another party.  Rather, this needs to be refrained as \"what support do I need while pregnant?\"  \n\nAnd the support YOU need is to confide in people who will be helpful and supportive to you.  Your MIL is not one of those people.  Your family and sister-in-law are.  \n\nActions have consequences.  And this won't be the first issue, either.  What about when you find out the gender?  What if when you give birth, you want your mom there and your MIL many miles away?  Will your husband want you to sacrifice a support person in order to avoid drama?", "It seems like your MIL is the \"town Cryer\" so NTA.\n\nBTW in my opinion the ONLY way to keep a secret is to not tell anyone.", "Unpopular opinion but I get where husband is coming from. Why rock the boat when you know it\u2019s on fragile territory? You both had an agreed strategy but you alone now want to deviate. So yeah I get his perspective (but I\u2019m more empathetic towards yours). \n\nNTA and you should do what\u2019s right for you and your relationship with your spouse. If you decide to share with your parents and MIL finds out, you need to be prepared for the long term consequences. Because there will most definitely be long term consequences.", "ESH, if you're planning to tell your own immediate family the same treatment should apply to his.", "Don\u2019t tell anyone till at least 13 weeks .,,   It May take a village to bring the kid up but it sure doesn\u2019t take one to carry & birth one \u2026.", "So I asked him if he thought he could get through to her. I think that explaining to her that we really struggled with the decision to tell her early and that we need to know that she will keep it a secret is important, but he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s worth trying because he knows she won\u2019t keep it a secret.", "She absolutely is! However, we\u2019ve decided to keep that between us until the birth.", "Yikes. How it it complicated? \n4/5 of those people are my parents and two sisters. They don\u2019t even talk to my MIL.", "We never had an agreement for my family - and we both realize now that we made a mistake! I never realized that he thought it might be better to not tell mine, to avoid drama with his mother.\n\nHe\u2019s not really against me telling my family, he\u2019s just nervous about the fallout.", "You do realize that he doesn\u2019t want to tell his mother, correct?", "So OP isn\u2019t allowed to access the support of her family, who can keep a secret, because her MIL refuses to respect people\u2019s privacy?", "I absolutely care about my husbands opinion. However, do you believe that the pregnant person should have to hide the news to accommodate the feelings of his mother?\n\nI have medical reasons to worry about this pregnancy, and I want the support of my mother and sisters during this time.\n\nHe understands me wanting to tell my family, he also wants to tell his family, he only doesn\u2019t want to tell his mother and he\u2019s freaked out by her possible reaction.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that you have felt with that, however my family has seen it\u2019s share of pregnancies and loss, and I can say with certainty that my sisters and mother would not be sharing this news with anyone.", "I can\u2019t talk to my husband for long periods of time during the day due to work. I want the support of my sisters and mother if something were to happen before the 12 week mark.", "That stinks. While it\u2019s on her, just remember this isn\u2019t about you fulfilling karma. This is only about having support. It sounds like if you had any reason to trust her you would and really are excited about her knowing - when it\u2019s safe.\n\nMaybe delay telling \u201ceveryone\u201d for a couple of weeks after you decide it\u2019s ok for them to know. Then tell her and let her spill the tea just a little? \n\nI feel bad for suggesting it. It\u2019s not my favorite suggestion ever. Feel kinda gross for saying it. Maybe take my earlier advice and not this advice.", "When people show you who they are, believe them. \nThis is your news to share. \nBest wishes sent.", "*Both* of MIL's children will know, and keep it from her? \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd28 Doubtful.", "Yeah, I've read that same statement in all my baby groups. It happens, people talk. Hopefully doesn't happen not to you. But husband has an equal stake in this pregnancy so just get on the same page with him, not a bunch of internet strangers.", "He asked me to post this.\n\nThank you!", "You sound overly defensive here. I get that, nobody wants to feel criticized for their choice of partner and it\u2019s very sensitive. I also understand this is one snippet, but there is no point reiterating that your husband is generally a kind and generous man when what matters here is that he cannot stand up for you when it counts. And this is when it counts. Character is about what we do when it costs us something as much as it is about what we do on a day to day basis. \n\nWhat should he do? Support you unequivocally in telling people who can keep a secret. All his reasons for not telling your family because it would be \u201cunfair\u201d still prioritize his mom\u2019s feelings over yours, let alone your family. That should bother you.", "I definitely got defensive. I don\u2019t take to people cursing about my family members well, and I\u2019ve seen a bit of that to my husband here. I understand that he needs to be prepared to stand up to her in the fallout and he will. He just doesn\u2019t want to, and I don\u2019t fault him for that.", "Your husband needs to change his mindset. He is not telling MIL to protect the family he is building, but he is also willing to hurt the family you are building (by denying you support you might need if things go south) to make your MIL feel better about her bad behavior.\n\nYour MIL is going to try to make this about you versus her. In order for this not to happen, your husband has to own this is a big way. He needs to jettison that placating nonsense and focus on protecting his family.\n\nWhen she throws her tantrum, he should be incredulous. He needs to act like telling her early and expecting her to keep it a secret would have been the most comically ridiculous thing that it is. Don't soft shoe it or give her inch, keep her defending her bad behavior and don't let her shift focus to him apologizing for his reasonable behavior.", "Maybe your husband can be on board with the plan of risking the fall out?  You need your parents and you need to not tell his mother or the world. I avoid drama as much as possible, but, sometimes you just move forward, cross your fingers and make the best decision you can given the options. (Although maybe don't tell his sister). I'm pretty bad at keeping secrets,  but my mom sounds like your mil, but on a less intense scale. So I learned from an early age privacy isn't a thing unless it's serious.  Your husband at least wants some privacy, which is a good thing. But, I kinda wonder if he just doesn't expect privacy any more. And if his mom is like mine that drama of an offense is a lot. My mom has big emotions randomly... So, hence the, I'll just tell everyone and I want to avoid the scene. (The thing is, outside of those flaws she is amazing, so to me it's worth the cost, although, maybe you should ask my husband that \ud83d\ude02)", "Maybe! I\u2019m going to talk things over with him and see what he wants to do.\n\nI want him to be able to tell his sister - because I do feel bad that I\u2019m telling my family and he doesn\u2019t feel like he can. I guess I\u2019ll leave that up to him! I\u2019m prepared for the fallout, because I honestly believe she doesn\u2019t have a right to be upset based on previous behavior. However, I don\u2019t want him to regret his choice. \n\nJust stressed because this is a happy time!", "You always have the option of waiting four or five months and letting everyone figure it out on their own.", "NTA - why is it never the person who causes the problems who gets told to 'keep the peace'??", "NTA. Your husband needs his spine shined.", "NTA. My MIL sounds very similar and told everyone in the family immediately even though we told her not to. It's your pregnancy, and you get to share it with who you want when you want. If she is upset by being told later than other people, that's completely her fault, and you shouldn't feel guilty about it.", "Edit 2: I see where you've posted about your fella being an upstanding person who totally has your back, so please ignore the next 3 paragraphs (between ______ and______, because I can't figure out how to do strike-through), though it would make it more fun. Would you be able to guarantee that MIL never found out you'd told your family first? Because if you can then she's essentially given you permission to do so (and your partner is giving her much more kindness and respect than she's given to others). Other option is to, when you tell MIL, let her tell her side of the family. Simultaneous posting maybe?\n \n.___________.\nYour answer to your partner, and to MIL *if* she ever found out are her own words...\n \n\"It doesn't matter, because no one would tell you they already knew so it would be just as special to you\".\n \nLiterally what she said/what she does. You're just copying her own behaviour!\n.___________.\n \nShe's probably going to get shirty about not being the first to tell everyone, even if you *don't* tell your family (seems like she revels in that stuff), so be prepared for that. Have the announcement set up and ready to hit 'POST' the second you've told her.\n \nBut it's not really fair for you to *not* receive important family support at a nervous and vulnerable time because MIL can't (doesn't want to/refuses to) keep her trap shut. \n \nAnd your partner will also have the opportunity to talk things out with your family without the fear that everyone will know private business. It might be an opportunity to deepen the connections (not a bad thing).\n \nCongratulations and best of luck to you!!!\n\nEdited to add: NTA", "NTA. Your medical condition = your news to share.", "NTA! \n\nPregnancy is a special experience that you should feel no obligation to share with those that would spread this information against your wishes. \n\nWhile keeping it from the MIL and telling your family is not the least problematic approach, it does come from a space of concern and desire for privacy, and therefore is not out of spite (not AH behavior lol)", "YWBTA\n\nWhy stir the pot? Keep it a secret until you are ready for everyone to know. Tell ILs & your family at the same time, a meal a special get together which you created. Don't make life harder than it already is. You know she gossips. You complain you don't like it but, you still listen.", "Definitely NTA, but just be ready for her reaction if she finds out that your family knew.", "Here's a thought: Don't announce. But when you're with your sisters, decline wine/sushi/p\u00e2t\u00e9, and ask for a glass of milk. When they give you a meaningful look, put your hand on your mouth and say \"Oh, dear!\". After that, the conversation happens because THEY figured it out, while YOU were trying to keep it secret - and you won't even be lying if MIL finds out they knew. NTA", "Husband is the one who doesn\u2019t want to tell her, so not doubtful there.\nSister doesn\u2019t tell her anything and they have a contentious relationship, I don\u2019t believe she would go share either.", "Have a dinner for both families then post it the same night.", "Well try it then, i don't know."]}
