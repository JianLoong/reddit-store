{"id": 26039, "submission_id": "167ji3b", "title": "AITA for publicly calling a colleague out on trying to pick me up at our workplace?", "selftext": "Context: a new colleague (around 30m) joined the company 3 weeks ago (big company, around 1500 ppl at our location alone), and I caught him staring at me (27f) from afar 6-7 times at least since. The first time I talked to him we were having coffee with my team and laughing about losing our jobs to AI, and his first sentence to me was \"I know it's a joke, but I'm sure a beautiful girl like you would have no difficulty getting settled in a different profession.\" I'm pretty sure he didn't mean to say 'Hey, you'd make a decent hooker', so I ignored the remark and he seemed to take the hint for a while and left me alone.   \n\nThen yesterday we were having coffee again and he came up to us. The conversation went like this:   \n\nHim: hey Nina, do you want to grab lunch outside today?   \nMe: uh, you mean with the team?   \nHim: no, just the two of us.   \nMe: oh. im sorry dude, but I'm not looking to date right now.   \nHim: I didn't mean as a date! Just a casual lunch between colleagues, of course!   \nMe: ...yeah, still gonna have to decline, but thanks for the invitation anyway.   \nHim: seriously, I just meant it as a \"work date\", strictly on the clock haha. I'm not going to try and hit on you, I promise.   \nMe: so you don't mind if Kelly and Ryan join us, then?   \nHim: I mean, I was really just hoping to get to know you better. I'm new and I've had lunch with several other colleagues alone, you don't have to assume it's a date.   \nMe: name three people you've had lunch with then, just the two of you.   \nHim: wow, what is this, an interrogation?   \nMe: well, since you're trying to pick me up-  \nHim: im not trying to pick you up!  \nMe: and yet I'm still not hearing the names.   \nHim: ...look, I'm really only looking to do a bit of networking here, you don't need to make assumptions-  \nMe: come on dude, we're not VPs here, we don't \\*network\\*. I already said no. Twice.   \nHim: you really don't need to be so defensive you know, I'm just trying to build a rapport between our teams, you don't have to come at me with the 'I have a boyfriend' shtick. I didn't ask.   \nMe: still waiting for the names.   \n\nHe got frustrated at this point and left. Now a few guys from my team say I was being too hard on him, either because he was being genuine (come on), or because I could have let him down more gracefully. One of them even said I could have just suck it up and joined him for lunch, it wouldn't have cost me anything.   \n\nI say it would have cost me my time, and that I tried to let him down the graceful way.
