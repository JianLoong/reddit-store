In most places, it is not legal to make a minor to pay rent.", "NTA - You are still a minor. Check your laws, in many locations it is illegal for parents to charge their minor kids rent.\n\nYou need to be able to save so you can afford your own place. Forcing you to pay them rent will make that goal less achievable and ultimately make you *more* dependent on them.", "NTA. You're a minor. It is in your parents' job description to provide you with shelter.", "NTA\n\nAt 17, absolutely not valid. They have a legal obligation to take care of you. Honestly debatable even at 18 or 19 given that you are going to school and have a job and are already paying for most of your own things including some, like doctors visits, that are your parents responsibility. \n\nMake sure your bank accounts only have your name on it. If your parents name are on it they can legally take all your money from the account because their name means they also \u201cown\u201d the money. Open a new account and move your money into it. \n\nYou should probably make plans to move out at 18. Look into apartments that need roommates to keep costs down. If you\u2019re going to a college see if they can offer discounted health care.", "NTA. They should be grateful that, as well as studying full-time, you're earning enough to pay some of your expenses. A lot of parents would be proud of you.", "NTA \n\nPersonally, I don't understand this Western culture mentality of 'as soon as my kid turns 18, they pay rent to me.' You are their parent. Not their landlord. In my culture, it is normal for parents to continue to support and help their child until they are financially independent. It just seems rather heartless to me that as a parent, you want your kid to pay rent to you rather than allow them to save their money as an investment for the future.", "NTA \n\nYou could tell them that you will call CPS to ask if it's legal for a minor to pay rent to her parents. That should shot them down. If not, call CPS.\n\nAlso i just saw that you already pay for stuff they are legally obligated to pay.\n\nI wouldn't pay a dime anymore.\n\nSave your money because they might kick you out at 18. Your parents are TA", "NTA at all. And as an aside, I don\u2019t get why some parents expect their kids to be investments and not just their children? Should\u2019ve bought rental properties or stock if they wanted return on their investments \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Absolutely NTA. If you brought this up to CPS or any similar kind of institution they would be rightfully telling you that your parents are financially responsible for you until you are formally an adult, and not vice versa. You have reasonably stated you feel you shouldn't be paying rent until you turn 18.their insistence is rude af and you actually made a great point by telling them you don't feel welcome at home there being their child if they continue to harass you like this before you turn 18.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think in general you should be paying rent until your ready to move out but certainly not before you are 18. Please don\u2019t pay them if you really don\u2019t have any other options I hope you have more generous family near by to move in with. In this day and age it is difficult to buy your own house at 18 to don\u2019t be stressed by the pressure and just save as you can aka moving somewhere cheap/ where you aren\u2019t paying rent to your parents for working as a minor", "NTA, if you were my kid and you offered to pay some board at 18 I'd be ecstatic. Not because of the money, it'll be just for being responsible. Save that money and hand it back when you actually move out.\n\nCould be what your parents are thinking.", "NTA, my sd is 22 and does far less, all around and we would, if we charged rent and were secure, save it secretly to give back. You sound like a great kid, wish we had one like you..very self motivated. Honestly they should be proud. You are still a minor. Would love to hear their argument for this but it sounds like taking advantage.", "INFO: How much did they ask you to pay? What is your families financial situation?\n\nNTA, regardless I think 17 is too young and expecting you to pay a large sum of money is ridiculous and unfair. They should be paying for your healthcare!\n\nThat being said charging adult children a small portion of what they earn which is then spent on the things they need helps teach how to manage their money, be responsible and appreciate all the things that are given to them.

I think it is more of lesson of what it will be like once you move out.

My new income increased the household amount so they were then responsible for more. My parents made it clear they didn\u2019t want to but had to so the family could survive. Made perfect sense but I\u2019m also glad they told me why. Any other situation, a child should never be required to pay rent.", "NTA.

Many of your age are off to university at your age, the vast majority of the rest stay at home doing low-paid work and getting ready to start on their own, fully supported by their parents.\n\nAssuming you\u2019re not being a general annoyance in any way, being asked to contribute by parents is a cheap and grasping move.  Save up, get a shared house, move out and start, a bit early, into adulthood.  Keep things as cordial as possible, and eventually be a better parent to your kids!", "Okay, so you're supporting yourself financially, or taking on the debt to do so afterwards. Well done!\n\nIn the meantime, you're asking your parents to feed, house and clothe a minor... which is their JOB under the law.\n\nNTA to not want to pay rent, but expect a renewed demand after you \"age out\" to majority. Good luck!", "See all we can do is assume one way or the other here. I myself have been paying my own way since I was 16 of my own choice. parents divorced and i didn't feel either one of them could provide for me, so I left. Now 35 I have a respect for being able to learn how to manage money and would rather have my kids learn before being out of the house and on their own.\n\nI have been already doing this with chores, such as cleaning their rooms, mowing the lawn, helping mend the fence when needed, cleaning their bathroom. They get an allowance every two weeks. I provide necessities while they are to use their money for wants. As they get older 16 or so give them a look at bills and ask them to pay some but in turn take that money myself to put a side for them to have for their first apartment. Which could be what these parents are trying to do but like what i said we can only assume one way or another.", "Just because you did it, doesn't make it right. OP is a minor and he already acknowledged that he might be okay to pay rent when he's 18. His parents shouldn't be forcing this issue, especially as he's already financially responsible for some of his expenses anyway.", "keyword being 'choice', as well as the fact that your situation (which i'm really sorry you had to go through) is entirely different from op's. and op has explicitly stated they pay for their own doctor's appointments, petrol, and other expenses, which means they clearly understand financial responsibility yet. if you want to say they're T A because of something you think /might/ be happening behind the scenes, ask for clarification on the purpose of the rent money first, otherwise you're not being objective.", "NTA\nUntil you are eighteen, it is the responsibility of your parents to provide you with shelter, food and medical care. Although, given that they are trying to take advantage of you, try to make sure they have no access to your money, and plan for when you hit eighteen, because then they can legally demand money.", "NTA - and trust me, once you start paying that\u2019s it for the rest of your life.

How long have you been in university? 17 would be to young to get loans where I live and also unusual unless you skipped a year at highschool. \nThe fact that you\u2019re in university and working may have made them neglect to take into account you are still a minor under their care. You may also not be as aware of their finances as you think. Maybe ask why they expect/want you to contribute. \nNTA though - you\u2019re effectively still a child and they should not expect you to pay for day to day costs.", "NTA but I hope you are saving at least some money. I have a 16M who earns about that much and we pay for things (that aren\u2019t luxuries) and I enforce the savings at least once a fortnight.

It is unreasonable to expect a minor to pay to have a roof over their head.", "Charging rent is never legal before the age of eighteen.

I do remember one person that has their 20 year old -that had a full time job - pay rent.  He was setup to head to college and then day of move in changed his mind and didn\u2019t go. Said all he needed was a $10 an hour job which he got working at a factory. He had so much disposable income it was crazy.  They charge him $400 a month which barely covered the extra cost of him living at home and they put the money in a college account for him in case he ever decided to go.  But they would keep it if he didn\u2019t go.  Intent was to help him see that $10 an hour was not big money like he thought.", "A lot of them claim that they put the rent money they get from their kids into a savings account for them. But then why not just let the child do that their self? Part of teaching a child to become an adult is also to allow them to have independence to manage their own money. Still having Mummy and Daddy manage a savings account for you is not really being an adult now. \n\nThis is what my parents did with me. They opened a savings account in my name and guided me on how much money I should put into it from my salary each month. I managed it completely by myself.", "I\u2019m torn between E.S.H and N.A.H tbh.\n\nThe amount your parents are asking for is way too high.\n\nThat said, asking for a token amount every month once a teen has an independent income is a good teaching method to prepare them for adult life, as part of their learning independence skills.\n\nWhen my older kids started getting their own income I asked them for \u00a312.50 a week as an affordable household contribution. I showed them the household bills (rent, utilities, groceries, etc) and showed them how these payments were a small fraction of the overall outgoings that go towards having the lifestyle they\u2019re used to. I taught them how to budget, how to prioritise spending, and how to save for important wants and needs.\n\nBeing a parent isn\u2019t about raising \u201ckids\u201d. Kids are already kids and know how to be kids. Being a parent is about raising adults to their best functional capacity so they can have the lives they deserve. \n\nThis stuff isn\u2019t taught in schools, and it hits hard to reach independent adulthood unprepared and have to struggle to learn this stuff while the consequences are much higher stakes. \n\nToo many people grow up not realising that rights are balanced by responsibilities and that lack of personal accountability can not only negatively impact their own lives but the lives of others too.", "That makes sense - where I am you wouldn\u2019t have been able to get a student loan until you turned 18. \nIt may not seem fair to you or many commenters but in five months the request to contribute would be far more reasonable than it is right now . \nRight now I would try to understand what their reasoning is for asking this if you. If need be remind them you are still under 18 for a further 5 months. \nBut be prepared to either contribute financially after your birthday or move out.\nEdit - how much to they want you to pay? It might only be a small amount that is a lot cheaper than moving out. But they should 100% not be expecting payment while you\u2019re over 18", "Thank heavens that it might be my confirmation bias kicking in then!  Your friend did the right thing; the \u2018sticking your head over the parapet\u2019 stage is coming to an end at 20, and it is time to start with your adult life.\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019ll be saying in a couple of years; right now it\u2019s nice that Child #1 volunteers to take us out for a pub tea every now and then!"]}
