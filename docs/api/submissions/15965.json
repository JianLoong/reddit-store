In most places, it is not legal to make a minor to pay rent.", "NTA - You are still a minor. Check your laws, in many locations it is illegal for parents to charge their minor kids rent.\n\nYou need to be able to save so you can afford your own place. Forcing you to pay them rent will make that goal less achievable and ultimately make you *more* dependent on them.", "NTA. You're a minor. It is in your parents' job description to provide you with shelter.", "NTA\n\nAt 17, absolutely not valid. They have a legal obligation to take care of you. Honestly debatable even at 18 or 19 given that you are going to school and have a job and are already paying for most of your own things including some, like doctors visits, that are your parents responsibility. \n\nMake sure your bank accounts only have your name on it. If your parents name are on it they can legally take all your money from the account because their name means they also \u201cown\u201d the money. Open a new account and move your money into it. \n\nYou should probably make plans to move out at 18. Look into apartments that need roommates to keep costs down. If you\u2019re going to a college see if they can offer discounted health care.", "NTA. They should be grateful that, as well as studying full-time, you're earning enough to pay some of your expenses. A lot of parents would be proud of you.", "NTA \n\nPersonally, I don't understand this Western culture mentality of 'as soon as my kid turns 18, they pay rent to me.' You are their parent. Not their landlord. In my culture, it is normal for parents to continue to support and help their child until they are financially independent. It just seems rather heartless to me that as a parent, you want your kid to pay rent to you rather than allow them to save their money as an investment for the future.", "NTA \n\nYou could tell them that you will call CPS to ask if it's legal for a minor to pay rent to her parents. That should shot them down. If not, call CPS.\n\nAlso i just saw that you already pay for stuff they are legally obligated to pay.\n\nI wouldn't pay a dime anymore.\n\nSave your money because they might kick you out at 18. Your parents are TA", "NTA at all. And as an aside, I don\u2019t get why some parents expect their kids to be investments and not just their children? Should\u2019ve bought rental properties or stock if they wanted return on their investments \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Absolutely NTA. If you brought this up to CPS or any similar kind of institution they would be rightfully telling you that your parents are financially responsible for you until you are formally an adult, and not vice versa. You have reasonably stated you feel you shouldn't be paying rent until you turn 18.their insistence is rude af and you actually made a great point by telling them you don't feel welcome at home there being their child if they continue to harass you like this before you turn 18.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think in general you should be paying rent until your ready to move out but certainly not before you are 18. Please don\u2019t pay them if you really don\u2019t have any other options I hope you have more generous family near by to move in with. In this day and age it is difficult to buy your own house at 18 to don\u2019t be stressed by the pressure and just save as you can aka moving somewhere cheap/ where you aren\u2019t paying rent to your parents for working as a minor", "NTA, if you were my kid and you offered to pay some board at 18 I'd be ecstatic. Not because of the money, it'll be just for being responsible. Save that money and hand it back when you actually move out.\n\nCould be what your parents are thinking.", "NTA, my sd is 22 and does far less, all around and we would, if we charged rent and were secure, save it secretly to give back. You sound like a great kid, wish we had one like you..very self motivated. Honestly they should be proud. You are still a minor. Would love to hear their argument for this but it sounds like taking advantage.", "INFO: How much did they ask you to pay? What is your families financial situation?\n\nNTA, regardless I think 17 is too young and expecting you to pay a large sum of money is ridiculous and unfair. They should be paying for your healthcare!\n\nThat being said charging adult children a small portion of what they earn which is then spent on the things they need helps teach how to manage their money, be responsible and appreciate all the things that are given to them. But if that's not what's happening here it's too much!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It teaches money management and not taking stuff for granted.", "NTA, assuming you're in the USA, your parents are legally obligated to home you, and cannot charge rent.\n\nIf your family was poor, then kids chipping in may be necessary (though not desirable), but as it stands, no, your parents should not be attempting to charge you rent.", "If you were if full time work then I would expect some rent pay, but as you are still in full time education then no, NTA.", "~~INFO~~: Who is paying for your university? You, or your parents?\n\n<Edited because OP answered my question, below, and appears to be NTA>", "If you were 18 and out of education with a full time job, I'd say YTA but since you only work part-time and are still in full time education and a minor, then you are NTA.", "As a parent I will say yes you are.\n\nI don't think they want you to pay rent to help them financially. I think it is more of lesson of what it will be like once you move out. This is help you further understand how the adult world works and how to save and spend your money wisely.\n\nIf you were my kid I would allow make this change if I felt you were splurging and not being responsible. I am different though. I like to watch my kids behavior and then guide them in the right direction, so my interactions with them and their rules have purpose and real life applications.", "NTA I had to pay $100 to my parents when I started working but only because we lived in low income housing. My new income increased the household amount so they were then responsible for more. My parents made it clear they didn\u2019t want to but had to so the family could survive. Made perfect sense but I\u2019m also glad they told me why. Any other situation, a child should never be required to pay rent.", "NTA. I hope you are saving up because they'll definitely start charging you rent at 18. Have you talked to them about what would be a reasonable amount?", "His parents should also still be paying for his necessities like doctor appointments", "thanks for the advice, am definitely thinking of moving out soon. if i'm gonna pay rent it might as well be for my own space where i can do what i want lmao", "American, not western.

I've heard horror stories.", "And see if your medical expenses are being similarly hypothecated.", "You do right to move out. Many of your age are off to university at your age, the vast majority of the rest stay at home doing low-paid work and getting ready to start on their own, fully supported by their parents.\n\nAssuming you\u2019re not being a general annoyance in any way, being asked to contribute by parents is a cheap and grasping move.  Save up, get a shared house, move out and start, a bit early, into adulthood.  Keep things as cordial as possible, and eventually be a better parent to your kids!", "Okay, so you're supporting yourself financially, or taking on the debt to do so afterwards. Well done!\n\nIn the meantime, you're asking your parents to feed, house and clothe a minor... which is their JOB under the law.\n\nNTA to not want to pay rent, but expect a renewed demand after you \"age out\" to majority. Good luck!", "See all we can do is assume one way or the other here. I myself have been paying my own way since I was 16 of my own choice. parents divorced and i didn't feel either one of them could provide for me, so I left. Now 35 I have a respect for being able to learn how to manage money and would rather have my kids learn before being out of the house and on their own.\n\nI have been already doing this with chores, such as cleaning their rooms, mowing the lawn, helping mend the fence when needed, cleaning their bathroom. They get an allowance every two weeks. I provide necessities while they are to use their money for wants. As they get older 16 or so give them a look at bills and ask them to pay some but in turn take that money myself to put a side for them to have for their first apartment. Which could be what these parents are trying to do but like what i said we can only assume one way or another.", "Just because you did it, doesn't make it right. OP is a minor and he already acknowledged that he might be okay to pay rent when he's 18. His parents shouldn't be forcing this issue, especially as he's already financially responsible for some of his expenses anyway.", "keyword being 'choice', as well as the fact that your situation (which i'm really sorry you had to go through) is entirely different from op's. and op has explicitly stated they pay for their own doctor's appointments, petrol, and other expenses, which means they clearly understand financial responsibility yet. if you want to say they're T A because of something you think /might/ be happening behind the scenes, ask for clarification on the purpose of the rent money first, otherwise you're not being objective."]}
