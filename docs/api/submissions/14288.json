Did you make sure your wife would have support system in olace for the time you'd be away?\n\nBc what I'm getting from your post is a guy who probably isn't an AH, but definitely is an idiot when it comes to communicating with his wife. She's heavily pregnant, full of hormones that are playing havoc with her emotions, grieving\u2014ofc she overreacted when you told her 9 men just died doing what you do for a living. I'm suspecting this whole thing isn't so much about you participating in that funeral (costs or no costs), but about her feelings on you having a risky, unpredictable career while she's about to give birth to your baby. Of all times this is the time she needs your assurance, she needs to know you're putting her and your family first. It's pretty much basic biology and psychology.\n\nThat doesn't mean you shouldn't want to go to the funeral. But you should've communicated that better.

I totally get wanting to be there for your friend\u2019s memorial, but your wife seems pretty emotionally fragile right now. Normally, I\u2019d be against giving in to ultimatums, but this one seems more like a cry for help. Can you talk it out with someone your wife is close to? One of her family members or close friends?", "This part. If course she's freaked out about you being a pilot right now. She's deep in grief for her father, living in a new place with (presumably) only OP as a close friend and support. You just lost 9 friends in a horrific accident doing the thing that you love. Even without the pregnancy, that's a whole lot of trauma and grief for both of you right now. Add in the pregnancy, when her hormones are all over the place and the fear of having a baby; it's not unreasonable that she would be scared of the possibility of losing you. Divorce is an overreaction, but it's probably coming a place of deep fear for her. You both need a while lot of gentleness right now and counseling/therapy."]}
