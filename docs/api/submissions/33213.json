We named her Calla after my wife's favorite flower and to honor my late grandmother, Lily. We announced the name once we had all the paperwork filled out. For us it was just easier in case anyone decided to comment something negative.\n\nAs you can likely tell from the title of the post, my sister did have a problem with the name. She asked us why we chose a \"weird name\" and then told us a more classic and sophisticated name would have been far better for our little one. I told my sister to knock it off and we did not ask for her opinion. She said she was \"only trying to help\" and I said very clearly we did not need or want her help with our daughter's name and it was already finalized and not up for change.\n\nTwo days after our daughter was born my sister sent my wife a list of names for girls. They were all very common names that have been used throughout the generations. Like Emily, Elizabeth, Hannah, Eleanor, etc. My wife replied that Calla's name was already official and not up for change. She told me about it when I got back from the store.\n\nThe next time we saw my sister she asked my wife why she wanted such an unusual and out there name, that nobody else will have. She told my wife that coming from foster care you would think she would understand the importance of having a name that blends in and is classic and easy to say and spell. I was not in the room when she said this. But she also told her that she was opening our daughter up for a lifetime of being asked about her name.\n\nShe left behind two baby names lists that day.\n\nI sent my sister a text that we needed a break from her if that's how she was going to behave. She didn't reply right away and then over the following couple of weeks she sent many more name suggestions and when we did not reply she sent a very long, very detailed email telling us that we did not stop to think about the name Calla when we chose it. She said it might sound pretty to us but when you have a name almost nobody else has it causes problems. She also said that people want and need names that sound like names and not words or plants that are being used as names now. She said she had no idea we were that try hard that we would pick a nature name as if that isn't one of the most idiotic things in the world. Then she mentioned my wife being a foster kid again and how she should know better of all people.\n\nI snapped and called up my sister to read her the riot act over the phone. I told her to keep her unsolicited and judgmental opinions to herself and if she does not stop sending us baby name suggestions then she will be permanently blocked. I told her I did not like her at all right now and she is being a major asshole and stopping so fucking low that it's disgusting. I ended the call without letting her reply and she blew up my phone after saying I had been so disrespectful and crossed more lines than her.

We named her Calla after my wife's favorite flower and to honor my late grandmother, Lily. We announced the name once we had all the paperwork filled out. For us it was just easier in case anyone decided to comment something negative.\n\nAs you can likely tell from the title of the post, my sister did have a problem with the name. She asked us why we chose a \"weird name\" and then told us a more classic and sophisticated name would have been far better for our little one. I told my sister to knock it off and we did not ask for her opinion. She said she was \"only trying to help\" and I said very clearly we did not need or want her help with our daughter's name and it was already finalized and not up for change.\n\nTwo days after our daughter was born my sister sent my wife a list of names for girls. They were all very common names that have been used throughout the generations. Like Emily, Elizabeth, Hannah, Eleanor, etc. My wife replied that Calla's name was already official and not up for change. She told me about it when I got back from the store.\n\nThe next time we saw my sister she asked my wife why she wanted such an unusual and out there name, that nobody else will have. She told my wife that coming from foster care you would think she would understand the importance of having a name that blends in and is classic and easy to say and spell. I was not in the room when she said this. But she also told her that she was opening our daughter up for a lifetime of being asked about her name.\n\nShe left behind two baby names lists that day.\n\nI sent my sister a text that we needed a break from her if that's how she was going to behave. She didn't reply right away and then over the following couple of weeks she sent many more name suggestions and when we did not reply she sent a very long, very detailed email telling us that we did not stop to think about the name Calla when we chose it. She said it might sound pretty to us but when you have a name almost nobody else has it causes problems. She also said that people want and need names that sound like names and not words or plants that are being used as names now. She said she had no idea we were that try hard that we would pick a nature name as if that isn't one of the most idiotic things in the world. Then she mentioned my wife being a foster kid again and how she should know better of all people.\n\nI snapped and called up my sister to read her the riot act over the phone. I told her to keep her unsolicited and judgmental opinions to herself and if she does not stop sending us baby name suggestions then she will be permanently blocked. I told her I did not like her at all right now and she is being a major asshole and stopping so fucking low that it's disgusting. I ended the call without letting her reply and she blew up my phone after saying I had been so disrespectful and crossed more lines than her.

I'm thinking she  probably has other things to focus on and could do with her husband sorting his sister's attitude out. It's one less thing for the wife to take on rn, and like you say she's vulnerable.", "i can 1000% see this being the start of a lifetime of bad mom accusations", "They're like a comfort blanket in a book", "Same here and I was going to ask the same question!", "Because you saw Logan\u2019s run.", "I get your point, but there are still lots of parents who use ridiculous made-up names that will definitely make lots of people raise an eyebrow. The kids may not get bullied by their peers, but these made-up names can definitely make it harder for the person to be taken seriously as an adult.\n\nThe first one that comes to mind is the parents who wanted to name their daughter Reighfyl (Rifle). I also remember some idiots who lived in Louisiana that wanted to name their daughter Beauxy (Bowie). Things have obviously changed and more names are acceptable now, but you're still almost assuredly setting your kid up for a life of misery if you name them some stupid shit like that.\n\nETA: I'm only talking about made-up names and stupid spellings. Calla and most other plant names are generally fine. I don't see any issue with OP naming his daughter that.", "Lol, my name is Melissa and I still was bullied! Just not about my name.", "I've got a similarly dated name - and everyone I know with it was named for a great-grandmother or someone like that.

There were always a few of us with my name in my fairly small grade school classes. I don't know anyone under the age of 40 with my name. I now have an old lady name.", "Same. My name was very popular in the late 80s/early 90s (though my parents chose a less common way to spell it). There was another girl in my class with the same name, and the school I went to was SMALL. Now I\u2019m 34, and I\u2019ve only met one person under the age of 30 with that name, and I used to work in childcare, so I crossed paths with a lot of kids.", "I was born in the early '60s there were 10 girls with the same name as me in my Freshman class in HS. The teachers always asked if someone wanted to use a nickname because while they did split many apart for classes, there were always two of us in each class.", "My guess is Tracy", "My name is never on anything, I actually take pleasure in that. It's not common and has an interesting back story for my \"fun fact\"", "Come along, Bort.", "speaking as someone whose birth name has a mangled spelling and who vastly prefers using \"Molly\" online . . .

Hubby and I hadn't heard that name for a long time when we chose it.
