My friends brother, John, arrived late with his children, the babysitter had cancelled and they still thought it was acceptable to bring children with them instead of accepting they aren't welcome.

Dark red\u2026likely to stain) and of course she tripped and the drink went everywhere over me, over my dress and my handbag and my shoes. All of which were either white or salmon. They're totally ruined. John came running over and picked her up, didn't even look at me and the whole party started fussing over her and how upset she was she spilt her drink. I just stood there in shock whilst they all totally ignored the fact everything of mine was ruined, juice got into my handbag and soaked my make-up, wallet, just everything.  I went and found my boyfriend, we left quietly because I can't be bothered starting an argument. I got home and tried my hardest to salvage stuff but the majority was destroyed. I texted John saying the total he owes me for my damaged items is \u00a3870 and gave him my account details for the transfer.\n\n\nNow, as sure as the sky is blue, he responded that he can't afford that and I should understand children make mistakes. My response was yes and as their father you are directly responsible for those mistakes, now please refund me the money for stuff. \n\nHe has ignored this text and it's been over three weeks so now I have reached out to a friend of mine who is a lawyer for advice about taking John to small claims court. This is where I might be the asshole. My friend think I should give him longer to respond and not pressure him so much but I'm not having this turn into a case where he pays me a bit every week and 400 weeks later it's settled.

However, I would follow your friend advice and formalize the request to John, like sending him an official letter stating the detailed damages, the costs, and some sort of (reasonable) deadline to reimburse, to gave him the chance to reimburse you in a way that won't hurt him financially. Going to small claims court before doing that, that would be AH.", "I foresee so many downvotes but I\u2019m going NTA. Why should you be out of pocket for his thoughtlessness?", "NTA. This is so far beyond the pale, it's not even a question. Dude brought his kid to an event where he knew the kid was not welcome, and the kid ruined your stuff. Replacing it is the dad's responsibility, full stop. If he's not willing to own up to that responsibility, you're well within your rights to get courts involved.", "NTA. Seeking legal advice is wise. Not excluding the possibility that taking him to court is wise. It's quite a lot of money and he IS responsible. Whether this was at an event where children were explicitly unwelcome is besides the point.\nI think it's a good idea to offer him a way to refund the costs in parts. 3 weeks is enough for him to have responded. Text him again. Say you expect a full refund, that you offer payments in parts, starting on date X. That you're open to a counter offer on eg. the terms (frequency, amount, and so on), but that you need a confirmation within a week.\n\nIf he doesn't respond or says he doesn't want to pay, take legal action. He's TA for not reimbursing your things.", "NTA", "NTA. Accidents happen and people pay for them. Get proof of the damages and that it can\u2019t be fixed through dry cleaning, receipts, etc. He\u2019s already ignored you for 3 weeks, court is the next step.", "NTA. \n\nBut be aware, even if you take him to small claims\nCourt and win, this could turn into a situation where he pays you a tiny amount for the next 400 weeks. (I presume. Im not that familiar with non U.S. courts, but if he really can\u2019t afford it they will allow payments).", "NTA.  Take his butt to court.  That's a lot of damage.", "INFO\n\nIf it was an adult who did this (assuming the juice was wine) would you ask them to pay or consider taking them to court?", "NTA", "NTA. He should pay for this. However, if you\u2019re asking to be reimbursed for what you paid for these items, you\u2019re not legally entitled to that. The second you took the price tags off the items, they became used so you\u2019re only entitled to the value of these items in used condition. That\u2019s probably why your friend is telling you to try to settle this out of court. You could end up only getting half of what you\u2019re asking for if you take this before a judge.", "NTA. You were attending an event where children were not supposed to be present, so they can't argue these things \"just happen\" around children. If *John* had spilled the drink he would be responsible, he's the reason why his kids were there, he's responsible for them, he can pay for the damage. Yes, children make mistakes, but so did John by *bringing* the children and not supervising them appropriately. \n\nIf you went to a family event/party where there were kids around in clothing/accessories that cost that much and got ruined I'd say you were on your own and that you were responsible for your own ruined belongings. However, I think it's reasonable to assume that your belongings should be safe around other adults.\n\nJohn clearly has no intention of paying this money. The three weeks isn't \"thinking\" time, it's \"I'm ignoring the situation and assume it's over with\" time. If you want your money you're going to have to push the issue, and that's what small claims is for.", "NTA He knew not to bring children and he didn't supervise them while they were there. The damage caused was all his fault. Your solution for him to make incremental payments is a fair one.", "This story seems like it\u2019s missing details . Why did no one bother checking on you if you were covered in juice from head to toe? Sounds like you aren\u2019t very popular in the group. NTA for taking him to court but be prepared to lose a lot of friends.", "NTA and YTA. NTA for asking for some form of assistance fixing the items or compensation to replace them. However, sending someone a bill demanding they pay for it without first having a polite discussion is a dick move. Going to small claims court for that amount likely isn\u2019t worth it with all the costs and fee. You will not come out looking good even if you win in court. The people at the party seem like both your and the father\u2019s friends. You will be seen as petty. Part of the evaluation should be the social fallout for even going to court.", "YTA; What do you want to do sue the 5 year old? Shit happens, get over it. Send the items to the dry cleaner or maybe just dye them black.", "YTA\n\nFirst you're obviously exaggerating. There's no way a spilled drink could have completely damage what was inside your bag.\n\nAt the end of the day you're asking 900 dollars because of clothes. CLOTHES.\n\nYTA", "NTA...but I personally would have let it go and never asked for the money. Shit happens...but that's me. And they say Americans are litigious.", "INFO: You\u2019re at a formal event without children wearing \u201call white or salmon.\u201d Was this a wedding, and were you wearing a white outfit to it as not the bride? That could explain why no one was particularly upset to see your outfit ruined. \n\nIf it was a wedding, Y T A. If not, N T A for asking for John to repay you, but this won\u2019t endear you to your friends and family members.

They're friends from university and as we've grown up we've stayed close but formed different opinions now, their kids stub their toe and they get the day off school, those sorts of parents. A child screaming over spilt juice is on par with world hunger to them.", "Yeah, I can't believe all the people justifying going to court over this. It's absolutely petty.

I would be throwing hands for that lol. That\u2019s not a \u201cWell he didn\u2019t mean to offend you by sticking dirt in your water bottle, silly kids haha\u201d sort of situation.", "It's the principle of it. That's a mortgage payment for some people. If your child has made that amount of damage, you should be held accountable.", "Bringing kids to a kid-free event, or letting the child run about in possession of something they could spill, either one seems like it would qualify as thoughtless. This is what sippy cups are for, isn\u2019t it?", "Then NTA. \n\nIf your only reasoning was that it was a kid and kids were not  supposed to be there then I would say that your request was more likely based on punishing the parent for bringing the kids. \n\nAnd not that you are asking, but I'm not sure you would be successful in a lawsuit. What would the claim be, negligence? Negligence is, essentially, the failure to conduct yourself as a reasonable person would in the situation (duty, breach, causation, damages.) You have a duty to behave as a reasonable person would, and you owe that duty to the world. If you do not behave reasonably, you\u2019ve breached your duty, and if that breach caused damage, you are liable. \n\nThe problem is that it\u2019s a party. The host let the kids stay. Kids are messy. Kids spill drinks. You knew when you went to the party that there would be other people there and that a certain amount of social interaction would occur.  Not every \u201cinjury\u201d is compensable, and the law makes allowance for regular social-type interaction. \n\nThe answer may be different if the kid walked straight up to you and tossed the grape juice at you, but you described this as an accident. \n\nOf course, none of this is legal advice, so consult your own lawyer.", "Since you said you\u2019d do the same thing whether it was an adult or a child - YTA. When you wear clothes to an event with food and beverages, there\u2019s an inherent risk of something spilling on you. Add people drinking alcohol, and the chances go up and you\u2019ll get spilled on. I feel like it\u2019s kind of a risk you take and it\u2019s really your responsibility. Most people kindly offer to pay for your dry cleaning or whatever, but I really don\u2019t think you have a leg to stand on to require someone to pay to replace your expensive items when you\u2019re at a public event with people milling around with messy things.", "Sounds like the one crying the loudest about spilt juice is you. I am not sure what attention an adult needs when they have spilt juice on them.", "Exactly. It would be different if for example the OP was hosting the party and the friend brought his kids without asking and the kids drew all over the walls with permanent marker or pouring soda down the air vents. \n\nIf this were an adult who spilled on my expensive outfit, I would distinguish between someone tripping over a shoelace dumping wine on me and someone who was shithoused and acting a complete fool being too animated while telling a story. In other words, intent. The OP could have just as easily knocked a wine glass over into her lap while at a table.", "Absolutely hilarious. You also have responsibility to take care of your own items. I don\u2019t leave my MacBook lying around in a busy bar because I understand spills happen and I want to protect my possessions. You chose to spend a MacBooks worth of quid on an outfit (you clearly can\u2019t really afford and in a easily stainable colour) and wear it to a party. Then an accident happened. You\u2019ll get nothing in small claims except a red face and never invited to another party again so good luck with that.", "I hear you, and I understand your point of view and yes it is a mortgage payment for many people. It sounds like it might be a mrotgage payment for the dad. There is more than one principle at work here. And all are equaly valid. Yours is that he should pay. Mine is that he should be let off the hook with no hard feelings. I only offer a different view and that is why I said your NTA. I do wonder if an adult bumped into you and spilled wine on you would you still seek repayment? I just want to make sure that your demand for repayment isn't some way at getting back at parents who don't parent in the way you mentioned in your reposnse to another comment on this post. Or getting back at a parent who had the audacity to bring his kid when he was asked not to.", "So for you it's the principle of it meaning you don't actually need the money, but he can't afford it. You sound extremely petty. You need to go back to kindergarten and learn the concept of forgiveness and move on.", "Perhaps if the kid was under five but at aorund five they no longer use sippy cups. We don't know if the children were running amok, this one just happened to  run up to the OP. So your scenario could be true or it may not be true. Maybe John thought that not showing up would be more thoughtless, that perhaps the party thrower would understand and it seem that they did. Was his choice to go with kids in tow questionable, perhaps. I am not sure of it thoughtless.", "Tell your child to apologise? Apologise to me privately? Take ownership for your responsibilities. As I've said we left the event quietly and I privately messaged the father.", "Absolutely I would be asking the same if it was an adult had spilt wine. As I stated in my post my boyfriend and I do not dislike children at all,  the opposite in fact but we have had a lot of fertility issues over the past few years that's unfortunately mean it isn't the chosen path for us. Thank you for sharing your viewpoint respectfully.", "If not thoughtless, we can just call it selfish I guess? \n\nIf an event is planned to be child-free, and you bring your child, you are potentially ruining that event for everyone that attends. \n\nMany adults look forward to going to events and not being around children, parents or those without.", "This is a legitimate request and I am sorry that did not happen. But this was not obvious in your post. It seemed the way you wrote it here as if you wanted more people to acknowledge your loss, which I get but as an adult I think I would shake it off. Again that is me, and I am not saying you are necessarily wrong.", "Did you show the father the stains on your clothes and your bag before you left the event? Also, did you take the items to a professional cleaner to see if they could remove the stains?", "I am very sorry to hear about your fertility issues. I know how difficult that is having had many friends experience it. And I am sorry about your clothes and your financial loss. I will add one last thing, IMO carrying this out into court or creating a rift in your friends group is just another way to make this unfortunate circumstance even more costly and in ways that make remuneration completely impossible. If you deem this issue worth all of the costs then more power to you. I also thank you for your respctfulness.", "Yes he seen me as he came running over after it happened, I sent him photos of the dress and shoes etc all completely stained. I took it three dry cleaners in the city and they all said there was nothing they could do with it, they offered to try on my wallet since it was the item I was least concerned about it, and no luck."]}
