Replacing it is the dad's responsibility, full stop. If he's not willing to own up to that responsibility, you're well within your rights to get courts involved.", "NTA. Seeking legal advice is wise. Not excluding the possibility that taking him to court is wise. It's quite a lot of money and he IS responsible. Whether this was at an event where children were explicitly unwelcome is besides the point.\nI think it's a good idea to offer him a way to refund the costs in parts. 3 weeks is enough for him to have responded. Text him again. Say you expect a full refund, that you offer payments in parts, starting on date X. That you're open to a counter offer on eg. the terms (frequency, amount, and so on), but that you need a confirmation within a week.\n\nIf he doesn't respond or says he doesn't want to pay, take legal action.

The second you took the price tags off the items, they became used so you\u2019re only entitled to the value of these items in used condition.

Yes, children make mistakes, but so did John by *bringing* the children and not supervising them appropriately. \n\nIf you went to a family event/party where there were kids around in clothing/accessories that cost that much and got ruined I'd say you were on your own and that you were responsible for your own ruined belongings. However, I think it's reasonable to assume that your belongings should be safe around other adults.\n\nJohn clearly has no intention of paying this money.

Going to small claims court for that amount likely isn\u2019t worth it with all the costs and fee. You will not come out looking good even if you win in court.

That's a mortgage payment for some people. If your child has made that amount of damage, you should be held accountable.", "Bringing kids to a kid-free event, or letting the child run about in possession of something they could spill, either one seems like it would qualify as thoughtless. This is what sippy cups are for, isn\u2019t it?", "Then NTA. \n\nIf your only reasoning was that it was a kid and kids were not  supposed to be there then I would say that your request was more likely based on punishing the parent for bringing the kids. \n\nAnd not that you are asking, but I'm not sure you would be successful in a lawsuit. What would the claim be, negligence? Negligence is, essentially, the failure to conduct yourself as a reasonable person would in the situation (duty, breach, causation, damages.) You have a duty to behave as a reasonable person would, and you owe that duty to the world. If you do not behave reasonably, you\u2019ve breached your duty, and if that breach caused damage, you are liable. \n\nThe problem is that it\u2019s a party. The host let the kids stay. Kids are messy. Kids spill drinks. You knew when you went to the party that there would be other people there and that a certain amount of social interaction would occur.  Not every \u201cinjury\u201d is compensable, and the law makes allowance for regular social-type interaction. \n\nThe answer may be different if the kid walked straight up to you and tossed the grape juice at you, but you described this as an accident. \n\nOf course, none of this is legal advice, so consult your own lawyer.", "Since you said you\u2019d do the same thing whether it was an adult or a child - YTA. When you wear clothes to an event with food and beverages, there\u2019s an inherent risk of something spilling on you. Add people drinking alcohol, and the chances go up and you\u2019ll get spilled on. I feel like it\u2019s kind of a risk you take and it\u2019s really your responsibility. Most people kindly offer to pay for your dry cleaning or whatever, but I really don\u2019t think you have a leg to stand on to require someone to pay to replace your expensive items when you\u2019re at a public event with people milling around with messy things.", "Sounds like the one crying the loudest about spilt juice is you. I am not sure what attention an adult needs when they have spilt juice on them.", "Exactly. It would be different if for example the OP was hosting the party and the friend brought his kids without asking and the kids drew all over the walls with permanent marker or pouring soda down the air vents. \n\nIf this were an adult who spilled on my expensive outfit, I would distinguish between someone tripping over a shoelace dumping wine on me and someone who was shithoused and acting a complete fool being too animated while telling a story. In other words, intent. The OP could have just as easily knocked a wine glass over into her lap while at a table.", "Absolutely hilarious. You also have responsibility to take care of your own items. I don\u2019t leave my MacBook lying around in a busy bar because I understand spills happen and I want to protect my possessions. You chose to spend a MacBooks worth of quid on an outfit (you clearly can\u2019t really afford and in a easily stainable colour) and wear it to a party. Then an accident happened. You\u2019ll get nothing in small claims except a red face and never invited to another party again so good luck with that.", "I hear you, and I understand your point of view and yes it is a mortgage payment for many people. It sounds like it might be a mrotgage payment for the dad. There is more than one principle at work here. And all are equaly valid. Yours is that he should pay. Mine is that he should be let off the hook with no hard feelings. I only offer a different view and that is why I said your NTA. I do wonder if an adult bumped into you and spilled wine on you would you still seek repayment? I just want to make sure that your demand for repayment isn't some way at getting back at parents who don't parent in the way you mentioned in your reposnse to another comment on this post. Or getting back at a parent who had the audacity to bring his kid when he was asked not to.", "So for you it's the principle of it meaning you don't actually need the money, but he can't afford it. You sound extremely petty. You need to go back to kindergarten and learn the concept of forgiveness and move on.", "Perhaps if the kid was under five but at aorund five they no longer use sippy cups. We don't know if the children were running amok, this one just happened to  run up to the OP. So your scenario could be true or it may not be true. Maybe John thought that not showing up would be more thoughtless, that perhaps the party thrower would understand and it seem that they did. Was his choice to go with kids in tow questionable, perhaps. I am not sure of it thoughtless.", "Tell your child to apologise? Apologise to me privately? Take ownership for your responsibilities. As I've said we left the event quietly and I privately messaged the father.", "Absolutely I would be asking the same if it was an adult had spilt wine. As I stated in my post my boyfriend and I do not dislike children at all,  the opposite in fact but we have had a lot of fertility issues over the past few years that's unfortunately mean it isn't the chosen path for us. Thank you for sharing your viewpoint respectfully.", "If not thoughtless, we can just call it selfish I guess? \n\nIf an event is planned to be child-free, and you bring your child, you are potentially ruining that event for everyone that attends. \n\nMany adults look forward to going to events and not being around children, parents or those without.", "This is a legitimate request and I am sorry that did not happen. But this was not obvious in your post. It seemed the way you wrote it here as if you wanted more people to acknowledge your loss, which I get but as an adult I think I would shake it off. Again that is me, and I am not saying you are necessarily wrong.", "Did you show the father the stains on your clothes and your bag before you left the event? Also, did you take the items to a professional cleaner to see if they could remove the stains?", "I am very sorry to hear about your fertility issues. I know how difficult that is having had many friends experience it. And I am sorry about your clothes and your financial loss. I will add one last thing, IMO carrying this out into court or creating a rift in your friends group is just another way to make this unfortunate circumstance even more costly and in ways that make remuneration completely impossible. If you deem this issue worth all of the costs then more power to you. I also thank you for your respctfulness.", "Yes he seen me as he came running over after it happened, I sent him photos of the dress and shoes etc all completely stained. I took it three dry cleaners in the city and they all said there was nothing they could do with it, they offered to try on my wallet since it was the item I was least concerned about it, and no luck.", "Good luck. It's extremely difficult to get a judgment like this, and chances are a judge will laugh you out of the court. Especially since you left the scene without detailing or discussing a single thing. In the end you have no proof of what actually happened, John can say I don't know what you are talking about, and unless you want to subpoena the other guests they will likely stay out of it.", "ESH. To be frank\u2014you kind of sound like a miserable person. Why didn\u2019t you ask for him to pay for the items to be professionally cleaned first? Then if that failed I can see seeking compensation for the cost of replacing whatever was beyond repair/ stain removal.", "I like how this sub basically exists in a vacuum. \n\nYou\u2019re NEVER going to come out \u201cwinning\u201d or not looking like the asshole by essentially taking a 5 year old to court. \n\nI truly hate to burst everyone\u2019s bubble, I\u2019m surprised this comes as a shock myself, but we do indeed live in reality and not a vacuum. \n\nGood luck, I\u2019m sure this will play out great.

And also it's just going to cause a bunch of tension as people are going to feel pressured to \"pick a side.\" At the end of the day it's probably better to just accept it as an unlucky accident and let it go.

The father took a deliberate action he knew was wrong because he HAD originally gotten a babysitter. So I can see it not being thoughtless but the rest I don\u2019t get what you\u2019re trying to say.", "More INFO: did you take any of the items to the cleaners for an opinion about whether the stains could be removed and how much that would cost?", "I\u2019m that case, yes YTA.", "Because that is the value of the items.  They are used; that's what they are worth.", "That\u2019s how the law works. When someone crashes into you and your car is a write off, they don\u2019t owe you the cost of a new car. They owe you the value that your car could have been sold for on the day of the accident.", "OP used these items so they are no longer worth what she paid for them. If a court awards her the amount she paid for these items, that would mean that she had the benefit of using these items for however long she had them prior to this incident for free. OP has to pay for the amount of times she used these things prior to the incident. \n\nI\u2019ll give you an example. Let\u2019s say you have a roommate who orders a pizza for himself. He eats about half of it then puts the rest in fridge for later. Later that night, you get hungry and eat the other half without his permission. You don\u2019t owe him for the full cost of the pizza. You only owe for half because the pizza was half eaten before you ate it.

Requiring 870 pounds is excessive and petty.", "I think the people in favor of going to court probably haven't been to small claims court. Courts don't want to deal with this kind of matter, so they make it a hassle. The judge will also want to know how much effort the plaintiff put into resolving the issue *before* involving the legal system. There is a decent chance the court will not find in OP's favor, or award less than the total.", ">I also strongly suspect that this wasn\u2019t the no-children-no-matter-what even that OP says it was. \n\nHonestly the entire paragraph about how kids weren't allowed at the wedding, followed up by how everyone paid attention to a crying kid makes this sound more like /r/childfree bait than an actual event. \n\nReally, *nobody* checked in with the person dripping with juice?", "Dress, handbag, shoes, and even makeup inside the bag all ruined beyond repair? Was the child carrying a big gulp?!?", "Ah right misread that bit on my phone.\n\nAll the same it just seems Petty.
