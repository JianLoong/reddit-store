That\u2019s just expressing your feelings. No harm done. Probably shouldn\u2019t tell her she has to wear more clothing and decide for her. I think that\u2019s your best course of action so I wish you the best.", "Ok, only a bra and underwear when guests are over is really \u2026 how to put this, a lack if decorum. Yes of course you would NBTA but she may not take it well.", "NTA, not because of 'modesty' or whatever, but because there's a point where what your wife is doing is actually kinda rude and inappropriate to your guests.\n\nLike, in general, I'd say it's an AH thing to want to control what your partner wears, but that's presuming they're exercising some very basic judgement about being appropriate. It's not an AH move to ask them not to wear shorts and a T-shirt to a fancy dinner party, it's not an AH move to ask them not wear a white dress to a wedding, and it's not an AH move to ask them not to wear lingerie around the house when you have guests over.\n\nIt *is* an AH move to wear sexy lingerie when you go to hang out with people who you don't know are cool with it! I actually think it's kinda creepy - like, if my wife had her friends over and I came out shirtless and wearing tight briefs, I'd surely be the AH. It's just rude!", "NTA.\n\nI think it's fine to ask your partner to dress slightly differently if you're having guests over. Wearing something over one's underwear when there's company visiting is a perfectly reasonable request imo.", "NTA. Instead of approaching this from a \u201cyou\u201d stance, approach it from a guest/host stance.\n\nA host should not do things that make their guests uncomfortable. Period. Just as guests should not do things that make their host uncomfortable. This is just common sense.", "NTA. Oof, I thought I was free spirited but I wouldn\u2019t be ballsy enough to walk around in just bra and panties in front of my husbands friends. I would offer a compromise, maybe some shorts and a crop top? I was prepared to say you\u2019re the asshole but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to not want your friends to see your spouse in that level of undress. It\u2019s crazy, short shorts and a crop top is BARELY more fabric. But it seems more courteous to attempt to wear \u201cclothes\u201d vs \u201cunderclothes\u201d. That, or maybe a swimsuit?", "NTA. The general social rule is to dress to the same level of formality as your guests.\n\nIf her guests strip to their underwear as soon as they arrive, then all is correct.", "NTA if you have a calm, open conversation where you bring up your feelings. It's all about cultural norms- it's very cool that she's able to buck norms, but where I'm from (USA), wearing a sexy bra and panties around guests is so unusual that it would probably be seen as a come-on. It might make guests uncomfortable, and guests that are attracted to women might have a hard time looking at her as just a friend. \n\nIt's not unreasonable to ask someone to adhere a bit more to the dressing norm, as long as you are open to hearing her feelings about it and coming to some sort of compromise together. Hopefully she also cares about the guests' feelings (and doesn't just want the thrill of turning them on).", "NTA. \n\nI have a friend who walks around her home naked, but the second guests are over she puts clothes on. Yes it's her home but common decency isn't an unfair ask. \n\nI agree with the others about just saying guests and not male guests. Asking her to maybe just throw on a simple dress, or long tank isn't going to make you an asshole", "My father in law always walks around in just  boxers it makes me very uncomfortable. There's still appropriate attire for different social settings.", "NTA I mean, come on. You put some damn clothes on when you have company. This is basic stuff.", "As a fellow female, I gotta say, girl have some class \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA, this is super weird. I could stretch my head around comfort, but choosing \"sexy\" items on purpose seems extra.", "NTA.\nI'm a female- dating a guy who is not controlling whatsoever- he's cool with me wearing whatever I want.\nHowever, out of respect for our relationship and his/his friends' comfort, I always just wear regular clothes when he has guy friends around. I don't feel the need to \"cover up\" excessively around them, but I feel like it really isn't too much to ask she just wears normal clothes.\nTo be completely honest, being a free spirit is one thing, and refusing to wear clothes around your friends is another.\nBring it up to her nicely, because she *might* genuinely not realize it makes you uncomfortable. BUT, if she refuses or acts weird about it, she's more than likely doing it on purpose to get a reaction/attention out of it, and that's not cool. Main point that bothered me on this is you said she wore one of her \"sexy bras\"- as a woman, if I were to be wearing short and a bra or something like that around my bfs friends, it would definitely be my casual sports bra type lounge wear- if she's going out of her way to wear something sexy around them that might be an issue to discuss...", "NTA . The bra thing is up for debate but everyone having to keep their pants on is beyond reasonable. For everyone saying that it\u2019s her house, it\u2019s OP\u2019s house too and he deserves to have his friends over without this going on. If nothing else she can wear some basketball shorts with a bra or sports bra.", "NTA. In front of guests is too much.", "NTA, you shouldnt have to ask.", "I literally cannot imagine walking around in a sexy bra and panty set in front of a male friend in my home. I go to nude beaches and clothing optional resorts, but a guest in my home?! Clothed! \n\nNTA and I\u2019d love to know what your friend has said, either verbal or body language.", "NTA. That isn't appropriate attire for a social setting and is probably making your friend uncomfortable.", "I say NTA. but I would definitely tell her how uncomfortable it is for you.\n\nIt's about respect.\n\nDon't dictate that she has to cover up, but tell her how you truly feel. And if she still doesn't care, then it shows the lack of respect she has for you. \n\nYou guys are married. You both need to have the same amount of respect for each other. \n\nYou live together and share the same house. You should be able to have friends over if you want. Just because she is comfortable with it doesn't mean everyone else is.", "NTA. She has every right to wear (or not wear) whatever makes her feel comfortable in the privacy of her own home. However, the fact you have a guest makes it not private. \n\nPersonally, as a guest, I would be uncomfortable and feel rather awkward if the host or hostess were in their underwear. That\u2019s simply not the societal norm. It is ok IMO to respectfully bring this up with your partner.", "WNBTA - when she has a girlfriend over come down in just tighty-whiteys.", "NTA, its insane people are saying otherwise. When guests are over she shouldn't be walking around in her underwear. Even to do it around her female friends just seem inappropriate. It might be her own house, but she should know better. At least throw on a long shirt or something.", "NTA it\u2019s not like you\u2019re asking her to change, you\u2019re asking her to actually wear clothes", "NTA at all\u2026 I literally could never imagine doing this in front of even my own male friends. Being in just underwear really isn\u2019t cool to do in front of guests unless everyone present is okay with it, which clearly isn\u2019t the case. It\u2019s absolutely not asking too much to ask your wife to put on clothes. Even shorts and a sports bra would be better than literal lingerie, so maybe offer that as a compromise? Honestly I find it really weird that you even have to bring this up with her and she doesn\u2019t recognize on her own that this is inappropriate", "NTA\u2026if I went over to someone\u2019s house and they were in their underwear I would leave.", "NTA, considerate of her feelings as evidenced by the post . The thing I would recommend to do is tell them straight up you intend not to be controlling, you want them to be themselves, and exactly how you feel when they prance around in their underwear in front of folks. \n\nIf things come back as harsh you can just say ok in whatever tone is correct and leave the discussion for when they are ready.", "NTA, whilst it\u2019s her own house and she can certainly wear what she wants in her own home, it\u2019s common sense and human decency to wear clothes when you have guests", "I'm all for people being liberal and comfortable with their bodies, but seriously? What is with all these Y T As??? It is still very much the social norm to be appropriately dressed in front of other people. Whether they are guests at your home or outside. I'm guessing your wife doesn't leave the house in lingerie because she knows it's unacceptable. And also illegal in most places. And the people here saying that if seeing your wife in lingerie makes them uncomfortable then THEY'RE the problem??? No lol. NTA OP.", "NTA, this is wild lol", "YWMNBTA This may be an unpopular opinion but it kind of makes sense to ask your SO to put on more clothes around the opposite sex/people who they are not comfortable with that level. Like a buddy of mine if it is possible will only hang out in boxers (I dont particularly mind when we are just chilling) but if his wife is having her friends over she makes him put on clothes I never once found anything wrong with that (though I wish he wasnt as comfortable with me and put on god damn clothing lol /s). Though I know some people are going to turn this into a her body her right type of deal which is entirely correct but that does not mean you cannot bring up the subject. You would be an asshole if you bullied/coerced her into dressing how you want but simply asking and working out a compromise I think is normal in any relationship.", "NTA! I would be extremely uncomfortable if I went to a friend's house and their spouse was walking around in tighty whities, or a bra/underwear, doesn't matter the gender. Likewise, it would be equally uncomfortable if I invited friends over, and my husband was just wearing boxers/briefs. Seems like some people have never had company before.. it's just not an appropriate thing to do!", "If you demand her to change then yeah. If you let her know how you are feeling and accept her decision then no you wouldn\u2019t be. \n\nAlso, knowing Reddit I\u2019ll get downvoted for this but to all of the people saying, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have friends over\u201d\u2026 what? You\u2019re literally saying she should be comfortable to do what she wants at home (true) and that he shouldn\u2019t be\u2026 if the roles were reversed and he was half naked everyone here would be telling her what a red flag it is, and that he\u2019s trying to eff her friends.", "NTAH- it\u2019s one thing to not wear clothing in your home WITH your spouse/partner- it\u2019s entirely another to not cover herself when guests are present - period.", "YWNBTA. I also get hot in my own home in the summer. But I don't wear a bra and panties... Those articles of clothing are really uncomfortable. I wear light flowy shirts/rompers/dresses. As a lover of comfort, the bra and panties sounds like she's actually trying to show off.", "You aren't trying to control what she wears, you just want her to put clothing on! I imagine it makes people feel uncomfortable. NTA", "NTA. If it was asking her to wear longer shorts or something that's a different story. But she's literally in her underwear which is low-key rude to guests.", "nta. if i went to visit my friend and someone was just walking around in their underwear, i would feel uncomfortable. more power to the people who don\u2019t feel like that, i guess, but for me it would be uncomfy.", "NTA. This isn't about modesty or control, it's about tact and consent. Your friends don't consent to see her undressed, you don't consent to your friends seeing your partner undressed. Thinking everyone should be okay with seeing you undressed because \"iT's NaTuRaL\" is tacky and a bit immature. Being a free spirit doesn't mean you don't have to respect the boundaries of people you want in your life. I say this as a free spirit who lives in underwear- until I have company.", "NTA \n\nThere's being a free spirit then there's being an exhibitionist!\n\nBut seriously, wearing her underwear around your male friends signals to me that she is starving for attention and maybe she loves the shock value. She's lacking common decency, though. She's crossed the line and you need to talk with her and ask her why she did that.", "NTA, brother. *EDIT to clarify. NTA (yet). You're allowed to have your feelings/thoughts. How you handle this will determine asshole status. :)*\n\nHowever, I'd suggest just stating the discomfort, asking for her perceptions/thoughts, and requesting (and giving) mutual input on how to proceed in a way that respects and protects everyone's comfort with reasonable, consensus, and respectful compromise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember now, this is one of her defining traits that you appreciate quite a lot. This isn't just her having to \"fix\" your discomfort.

Do people really know what commitment means? Commitment means \"an engagement or obligation that restricts freedom of action\" You are asking her to restrict a behavior as a means of honoring the commitment you both agreed to make. She willingly decided to be obligated to you. Asking her to wear a bath robe isn't that much of a change. She should be willing to restrict her behavior due to you being monogamous. The same way that she isn't sleeping with other people because of the commitment, it's no different in this instance. She's not single. You can't act single in a marriage. You aren't asking her to do something that changes who she fundamentally is. Don't wear clothes at home? Cool, but your friends also didn't sign up to see her in your underwear and she could be making them uncomfortable.", "I would leave gender out of this. It's common decency to wear clothes when you have guests over.

As someone who loves hanging out in as little clothing as possible during the terrible season of summer, I get wanting to walk around in my underwear. But what you're asking isn't sexualizing her or shaming her; you're asking her to have courtesy for your visitors, who may be uncomfortable with her level of dress.", "NTA. Personally I feel like it's a respect thing - particularly towards your guests. Some people would feel understandably uncomfortable and awkward.\nMaybe try putting the shoe on the other foot and ask her how she thinks her friends would feel if you did that to them!", "If anything you can say you feel uncomfortable when she\u2019s in just her underwear when you have male friends over.  Use \u201cI\u201d statements that way you aren\u2019t telling her what to do or placing judgement. If she\u2019s not receptive then you can just say that when you are going it see your friends it will be elsewhere. It\u2019s great she\u2019s comfortable in her own skin but I (f) don\u2019t think it\u2019s controlling to not want your guy friends to see your wife in her undergarments.

If they are my coworker, or just someone I hang out with, it would make me uncomfortable seeing her wearing just her underwear. Now I probably wouldn't say anything about it really just because I would kinda feel that as the guest, it's not my place to say anything about how they behave in THEIR home as long as it's legal.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\nI believe that if you have guests over you should wear something that you would wear outside. She doesn't have to dress up or something, but she should put on a T-shirt and a pair of jeans.

I won't be surprised if you get some comments telling you it's controlling or whatever, but I think not walking around in underwear when there's company is just the bare minimum of common courtesy, especially when you're in a relationship.", "NTA, this is exhibitionist behavior at the very least, and it's not something any sane wife would do with other people in the home. \n\nit's a different story if you're both into it, but then I would think it would get weird for your guests ... unless you're all into it, of course. consenting adults and all that.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a male/ female issue.

Because of the implication.", "Compared to my underwear... \n\nIt's the same color black or blue. \ud83d\ude02 It's just more water compatible.", "And there's nothing wrong with that. He's an asshole for not wanting other men eyeing his wife? Really?", "? Since when did dressing sexy become sexual harassment?", "If it were a thong, that's relevant info and would change my opinion on not calling it sexual harassment. Exposing her ass is absolutely sexual harassment.", "If I went to someone\u2019s house and their boyfriend was wearing skimpy lil red briefs (yes this is something that happens to me all the time) and nothing else, I would be uncomfortable. I wouldn\u2019t want to see that. I would think it was rude of him. I just don\u2019t know if I need to agree to it for it to happen. I certainly wouldn\u2019t tell him he has to change. If anything I\u2019d feel like if I was so uncomfy I couldn\u2019t stand it, I\u2019d leave. \n\nIt just doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s violating my consent by wearing underwear in his home. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just not getting this one.", "If he's worried they're going to eye his wife, why are they friends?", "Exposing yourself to people who didn't ask for it is bad. Why is this such a difficult concept for some of you", "Not legally but morally, maybe. I have to think about those guys' partners and how they would feel about it.", "Are you being obtuse on purpose?", "Because then his friend group will more or less be restricted to women, which I'm sure his wife would \\*love\\*. I'm guessing you're not very familiar with heterosexual male sexuality or behavior.   \n\n\nThere's also simply the fact that it's ok to not want other people of any sort to view your partner near nude. Some people consider that intimate and reserved for their partner, shocking, I know.", "I think the issue I'm having with the specific term \"sexual harassment\" is that she's not exposing herself and (presumably) does not have sexual intent. I think one of those would be necessary to call it sexual harassment.\n\nIt's all pedantics, but for sexual harassment, he should file for divorce. This isn't that. This is worth a discussion about inappropriate behavior.", "Good thing you aren't a judge then because sexual intent doesn't mean jack shit. People get out on the sex offenders registry for pissing outside. Tell me how a drunk guy pissing in an alley is sexually intended. It's sexual harrassment. Really doubt you'd be jumping through hoops if the genders were reversed."]}
