Honestly though, you need to practice saying \u201cno\u201d in front of a mirror. Your brother has 4 kids, not 3.", "Your SIL and brother are massive assholes. Dropping off your kids with someone who has repeatedly said no is unacceptable. I would say no very clearly - and tell them that if they leave the kids here anyway I will call the police or child services on them for abandoning their children. And I would totally do it. They are not your kids. They must arrange childcare for their children. \n\nAnd your SIL and brother on top of that horrid behavior has the entitlement to demand things for them that you are supposed to provide?!? Even if they provided their organic fruit juice or whatever, they would still be assholes for disrespecting both that you said no and that you are working. \n\nI never stop being shocked by how horrible some people can be.", "NTA. It's bad enough that she expects you to babysit for free while you are working, but she's also expecting you to have your fridge stocked with her approved groceries at all times just in case she shows up on your door. The absolute least she could do is to bring the foods she wants her kids to eat so that following her rules becomes the easier thing to do.\n\nShe's getting what she paid for.", "NTA. You\u2019re already doing her a *huge* favor babysitting when you\u2019re working, she can\u2019t seriously except you to buy groceries according to *her* household habits. If she wants you to feed the kids what they eat at home she can drop off the food when she\u2019s dropping off the kids.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re working your actual job. You didn\u2019t volunteer to babysit your niblings, honestly SIL should be grateful you aren\u2019t reporting her for abandoning her kids.", "Like. Lock your door. Don\u2019t answer. Don\u2019t pick up your phone. \n\nI can\u2019t believe you are unwillingly being forced to watch them. \n\nDrop them off at the police station.", "NTA. Lots of AH behavior from SIL though. If she isn't going to provide the food, drinks, and, idk, maybe *appropriate notice* for you to care for her kids then she can just suck it up. You're already doing her an insurmountably large favor by watching her children free of charge, on little notice, and while you are working. \n\nSide note: you *are* being a bit of an AH to yourself by not standing up to her and letting her know that you cannot always just take her kids. She needs to plan accordingly and either give you more notice/maybe actually ask first, or find alternate childcare when she really needs it and you can't help.", "NTA. I'd do the same thing if I were in your shoes. Your house, your rules . . . and it doesn't seem to bother her enough to make her stop dumping her kids on you. All the other family members who're saying Y T A are welcome to step up and open their homes, cupboard, and tv's to SIL's kids instead.", "NTA \n\nIf they want their kids fed specific food and drink, they can supply that. If they want an opinion on how you watch the kids, they can pay for that. Otherwise you\u2019re under no obligation to humour their rules when they abandon their kids without pre approval at your home. You are very kind to tolerate it in any capacity.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nShe is already taking advantage of you. The saying goes, \u201cYou get what you get and you don\u2019t get upset.\u201d\n\nShe can send them with lunches, snacks and drinks if she\u2019s so concerned. This isn\u2019t how favors work.", "NTA. How can people still not understand that working from home is still *working*? Your SIL probably wouldn't drop her kids if you worked outside your home, would she? She's completely out of line here.", "NTA!", "NTA - Buy an espresso machine and teach the kids to use it. That's a joke, mostly. \n\nBut seriously - you are not hiding these things from your brother/SIL. They are choosing to continue dropping the kids off knowing what the situation is. They clearly care more about free childcare than they do about organic fruit juice.", "You say you don't want to watch the kids but you still watch the kids for the sake of peace you claim. You have no intention of following the rules she has for her kids so you are not really interested in peace.  Being passive-aggressive against their mom is an AH thing to do even if you don't agree with the way she is raising her kids. Just stop taking the kids already so you can stop using them as pawns. YTA", "She isn't forcing you to watch them if you allow it. That said, your house, your rules. If the parents don't like it, they can find another sitter. Even if they supply what they want the kids to have, you are under no obligation to only give them that, unless the kids have health issues that require it. NTA", "YTA to yourself, and I\u2019m not understanding why you continue to do this. No one can force you to watch children, be an adult and tell her no. If she continues then tell her you\u2019ll call the police for abandonment. I hate when people complain about something that is easily within their power to change, so do it.", "I can't believe you allow this to go on.  Your job is a JOB.  stop allowing her to drop her kids on you.  I would be soooooooooo irritated.  I can't even get to the \"rules\" part.    I would not even get to your A and B.  Just say no.  You are 27.  Own your own life.", "NTA but I find it so strange that people on reddit allow themselves to be \"forced\" to babysit for entitled family members. You are working, you can say no and just....not do it. People can't just drop their kids off and make you babysit lol", "NTA.  You\u2019re going above and beyond by watching the kids at all.  And your requests are obviously extremely reasonable.\n\nYour brother and SIL are textbook r/ChoosingBeggars.", "My in-laws never work with the rules I set out and I find it incredibly disrespectful. I came in to this thread so ready to call you an A H, but you are **NTA**!\n\nThe audacity of this woman! She has no respect for you, your time, your money or your job, but she expects you to respect her rules? Nope. She expects you to buy food for her kids? Nope. \n\nWhy are you putting up with this nonsense?", "Tell her the next time she drops them off without asking you will call the police to report them as abandoned.\n\nYou are not obligated to babysit.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nShe is a begging chooser.

It's fine to help here and there but if it's consistent (and while you're working), it's tough to expect you to be \"this\" or provide \"that\" if it's not provided for you.\nHaving said that, by letting the kids be free, the kids themselves might start requesting you be the regular babysitter.", "NTA.\nShe leaves her kids with you after you've told her repeatedly that you're working. They aren't your kids and you're at your house. If SIL actually gives a rat's ass, she can, like you said, pay you or provide the food and entertainment she requires for her kids.
