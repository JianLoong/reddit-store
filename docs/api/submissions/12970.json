So how could she move in with us?\n\nWell, my husband was having a pretty rough day a few months ago and told her he missed her, and instead of reacting like a normal parent and returning the sentiment... A week later she was in contact with a realtor to sell her place. Didn't discuss it with my husband, didn't think to plan, sold her house. Crazy impulsive but alright fine. I don't mind having her closer, she's a wonderful woman and very sweet.\n\nHere's the catch: she's a literal financial disaster.\n\nShe sold her house at the beginning of this month and has already used $50,000 to buy herself a new car. She didn't need a new car. She doesn't work, is retired, and lives off of disability checks. Once she has it, it doesn't last very long. This awful history with money also affects my husband, as when she needs money she obviously doesn't have, he's her failsafe. Even when we were broke college students he would send her hundreds of dollars we barely had for things like vet bills (who gets a st.bernard when they eat food from a food bank?!). If financial literacy was a person, they'd have a restraining order against her.\n\nAs of this post, she's already on the road making the cross-country trip to get here. Who sells their house and leaves without lining a place up? We would ask if she has found a place yet and her response was always \"the realtor is still looking\". She also \"\"promised\"\" she wouldn't crash on us without warning.\n\nThe real kicker is that my own mother got evicted and is also moving this month. Long story unrelated, she was the first to need to move, and also my priority. I was pissed that his mother would choose to move already being fully aware that we were hands deep in trying to find MY mother a place to stay. I already set the boundary that mine wouldn't stay with us. Now both moms were moving at the same time.\n\nYesterday, we were on the phone with his mom and she accidentally let slip that when she gets here she needs something specific in our bathroom. My husband confronted her about staying with us and she got defensive said \"of course I am\". I immediately took the phone and let her know that wouldn't be happening, as we had already told her before she was on the road that it wasn't an option. She broke down in tears and tried to guilt us into it, so I offered to pay for a hotel for a week or two but that she needed to find a place. She hung up and texted that it was our fault for uprooting her life on one side of the country to move to the other. My partner never told her to pack up and move here, just that it would be nice to have her closer in the future. He's been in an awful mood since and I can see her guilting is starting to work on him, since he's asked me if it would really be so bad.

Selling your house without having somewhere else to live is honestly just idiotic but adding to that the assumption that she'll just show up and crash with y'all after being told no?  You're not playing favorites either since you told your own mother no as well.  I'd stand my ground and if he allows her to move in tell him you'll be moving out and if she's not gone shortly divorce papers will follow.  I don't necessarily believe that will come to pass unless he has a history or caving in to his mom's whims and always coming to her rescue when she makes a stupid decision.", "NTA - oh god please do not let any leeches move into your home.", "NTA\n\nNO!!!!! \n\nYou know that once she moves in, she isn't moving out.", "Girl, NTA. There\u2019s a lot going on here. \n\n1. It\u2019s insane to sell your house without lining up a place\u2026especially when you\u2019re moving that far away. \n2.
