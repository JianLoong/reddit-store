She didn't need a new car. She doesn't work, is retired, and lives off of disability checks. Once she has it, it doesn't last very long. This awful history with money also affects my husband, as when she needs money she obviously doesn't have, he's her failsafe. Even when we were broke college students he would send her hundreds of dollars we barely had for things like vet bills (who gets a st.bernard when they eat food from a food bank?!). If financial literacy was a person, they'd have a restraining order against her.\n\nAs of this post, she's already on the road making the cross-country trip to get here. Who sells their house and leaves without lining a place up? We would ask if she has found a place yet and her response was always \"the realtor is still looking\". She also \"\"promised\"\" she wouldn't crash on us without warning.\n\nThe real kicker is that my own mother got evicted and is also moving this month.

She hung up and texted that it was our fault for uprooting her life on one side of the country to move to the other. My partner never told her to pack up and move here, just that it would be nice to have her closer in the future. He's been in an awful mood since and I can see her guilting is starting to work on him, since he's asked me if it would really be so bad.

Also my husband was actively looking for a new job for more pay and as it was a specialist industry, it meant there was no jobs nearby. We would be moving far out of the area. But she insisted that would never happen! Wouldnt listen. She had made up a narrative in her head of what was going to happen, because that is what she wanted to have happen. No logical thinking at all. She moved from a one bedroom bungalow suitable for an older person, to a three bedroom house with a bathroom upstairs she couldn't manage. Hubby got a great job offer and we moved across the other side of the country. Of course she made out to everyone that we had made her move, then abandoned her.
