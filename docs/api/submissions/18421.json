Then go somewhere the children can\u2019t see you? So I said that; she said \u201cI will keep that in mind for next time\u201d next time it was the same story, just go somewhere to have it or don\u2019t drink it! I know they\u2019re not meant to eat or drink unhealthily in front of the children.\n\nSo I complained to the manager who moved the seating area inside, I\u2019d been picking my son up and heard her on the phone in the loos (the adult loos are sort of outside of the nursery building? It\u2019s a community centre can\u2019t describe it well enough) saying how she just wanted to chill on her break, and it\u2019s boiling hot inside.\n\nMy husband is on my side but my sister said I was completely overbearing; but as I was in the shop my son pointed out the energy drink and was like \u201c*teacher* drinks those\u201d so am I overreacting?\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1685310954, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ucbgq/aita_for_putting_in_a_complaint_against_my_sons/", "score": 403, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not like it's alcohol. You are DEFINITELY overreacting. One energy drink is not unhealthy, infact even 2 a day is not unhealthy. It's called moderation.", "YTA.  Teaching is an incredibly difficult and taxing job and situations like this just make it harder. They\u2019re human beings to and they need their breaks.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of unreasonable to me to think that everybody should cater the world around not exposing your son to things like energy drinks.   If she was sitting in class teaching them about how great energy drinks are, that would be a different thing, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening.\n\nWhen I was a kid I knew my parents drank beer and coffee and I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. The issue was not the teacher, it\u2019s the fact that you expect the teacher to do the parenting on her break", "YTA, bar none. Reporting a teacher who you describe as \u201cgreat with the kids\u201d for drinking an energy drink/wanting to be comfortable on a *break*, is asinine. \n\nIf an energy drink is your boundary for being a \u201cbad influence\u201d, then you\u2019re in for a hell of a ride once you enter the real world.", "YTA\n\nNothing is worse than people who think they can control what adults do. She was on her break, trying to relax, so you found a way to ruin it for her.", "YTA\n\nShe\u2019s on a damn break. Idk I couldn\u2019t imagine caring about something like this.", "YTA You were being \u201cthat parent\u201d. It sounds like you deliberately created problems over nothing, because you don\u2019t appreciate the teacher being focused on the kids rather than the parents. She\u2019s there to look after the kids, not to entertain you. Find a hobby.", "YTA\n\nLast I checked energy drinks aren't illegal and you don't get to police what teachers eat/drink.\n\nTurn your son's comments into a teaching moment about food that is good for adults and not for growing children. \n\nThere are enough issues keeping good teachers and parents like you are not helping.", "YTA, it\u2019s not hard as a parent to also let your kids know that those are \u201cadult beverages\u201d or as most parents tell their kids, \u201cnot for children\u201d. You can easily teach them healthy eating and drinking regardless of what is being drank in front of them at camp. Also, you are telling me no one has ever had tea or coffee in front of your little one? Because although that may not have as much caffeine those are still only for adults if they do and you just communicate to your kids.", "INFO: Do you drink coffee in front of your children?", "YTA. Overbearing is a really good adjective for this controlling behaviour.", "YTA\n\nShe wasn't drinking liquid meth... She was drinking an energy drink. As a parent, it's **your job** to tell your kids what foods/beverages are appropriate for kids and which are reserved for adults. \n\nAnd there's nothing wrong with being \"shy\" or introverted or having social anxiety.  (Not saying she has any of those, but most people cant distinguish between them, so she may have one or none of them).  Not everyone your child approaches in life is going to act like the Barbie in Toy Story 24/7.", "It's an energy drink, not a beer. Hard YTA.", "You are not the snack police\n\nYTA", "YTA. Calm the f down and stop trying to control how she does her job.", "YTA. \n\nWhile encouraging healthy eating habits is a good thing, this was really not your business. Everyone has their \u201cvices\u201d and this one is not even a thing. Your kids are GOING to see people doing unhealthy things. I\u2019d argue seeing their teacher tired but unable to rest with their chosen beverage is more damaging.", "YTA\n\nYou cannot decide what someone can and cannot have on their break. Many people seek out caffeine during their work day. For some it's coffee others it's soda and for some it's an energy drink. It is not like she was having a beer and watching over children. It is your responsibility, as the parent, to set what you feel are good examples for your children. You cannot expect or demand someone to bend to your point of view.", "YTA! Mind your own business. Unless she was trying to sneak it into their bottles or sippy cups, buzz off!", "YTA. I would imagine that if you had to teach children all day, you\u2019d need some kind of pick me up too. It\u2019s an energy drink, not alcohol. Are coffee and soda off limits for you to see your kids teachers drinking on their breaks too? Do you think other kids\u2019 parents don\u2019t consume anything \u201cunhealthy\u201d in front of them? You\u2019re overreacting. It\u2019s hard enough to get good teachers as it is.", "YTA. He said his teacher drinks those. So what? She's not doing anything illegal. You don't ever consume anything unhealthy? Cake? Chocolate? Coffee? Give me a break. You went way too far. YTA.", "YTA.  The whole world doesn't have to bend to be good examples to others kids.  I don't want to live in a world where everything must be child friendly.   You as the parent set boundaries for your kids, you don't get to force strangers to change their behavior.", "YTA.\n\nBeing a \"good role model\" is extremely subjective to begin with, but it wasn't like the teacher was trying to get kids to drink energy drinks. If you're concerned about your son wanting to try one then that's up to you to set boundaries and expectations and clearly communicate this to your son. You'll encounter many situations where your son sees something that's meant for only adults. Instead of freaking out at the teacher, why not see it as an opportunity to talk to your son?\n\nNowhere in your recounting does it appear the teacher is rude or a bad role model. She is exercising her right to her free time. Perhaps you should stop and ask yourself why you think you not only have the right to confront her about what she can and cannot eat/drink on her break, but why one energy drink was such a big deal that you felt the need to attempt to get her in trouble at her job over it.", "Your sister is right; you and your husband are completely wrong. \n\nYTA. So very very much the AH.", "YTA oh no, not an *energy* drink! and in front of *children*! and oh lord your son saw one in the store and noticed that it was just like the one his teacher drinks! clearly he is now headed down a path of degeneracy and will never have a good life.", "YTA.  If any of the 1-4 year old children can identify an energy drink, that would be down to the parents, wouldn't it?\n\nI'd actually like to contribute to *something stronger* for the poor staff to have on their free time from dealing with parents like this...", "JFC. Lady you need a hobby", "YTA. If you\u2019re this awful to be around to adults who only see you for a minute whenever you drop off or pick up your kids, then I feel bad for your children who have to be around you everyday.\n\nIf you\u2019re not comfortable letting your kids drink energy drinks, then that\u2019s your choice but it doesn\u2019t mean you get to police what your kids teacher does on her break because you\u2019d rather do that than tell your kid no when they ask for one too.", "Assholes like you are a major reason that so many teachers get fed up and leave the profession. I'm willing to bet you don't eat healthy all the time. You're just desperate to find a reason to attack the teacher so you invented one. There's nothing wrong with her drinking an energy drink or being shy. You aren't just overreacting; you're being controlling and you're happy to sabotage her reputation and get her in trouble when she literally did nothing wrong. I feel sorry for your son for growing up with an asshole like you. YTA", "YTA. You're acting like she's taking shots in front of the kids. There is nothing wrong with an energy drink every now and then. \n\n\nYou are being completely overbearing. She didn't do anything wrong. If you have an issue with energy drinks then you can educate your children but it's no one else's responsibility to hide it from them.", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA. Perhaps you could buy her a personalized tumbler as a show of gratitude (and as a form of apology for being an AH) if the can bothers you so much. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "YTA without question, and probably irrational.\nYes, an energy drink is not perfectly healthy, but she is not doing drugs in front of the children.\nDo you hide coffee or tea from your kids? Do you forbid the presence of sugar and fats?\nShe isn't doing anything wrong and you are just being insufferable.", "Omg YTA. \n\nThat woman probably needs the caffeine to be able to deal with your little angel.  You aren't her mother or her boss.  Mind your business and parent your child.  Adults are going to do things kids can't do.", "YTA, you\u2019re acting like she gave your son an energy drink. Even if you thought he would want one after seeing the teacher drink one, you don\u2019t know how to tell your son \u201cno, those are for adults?\u201d Or something??", "YTA.\n\nGood Grief.   Do you drink Coffee around your kids or wine or freak out if someone else does?   You are overly controlling and way out of line.\n\nAnd what do you have against introverts?  You are just picking at this gal and trying to be a bully.\n\nAlso why are you eavesdropping on her in the toilet!??\n\n>heard her on the phone in the loos", "YTA. Why do you think you have the power to control what someone eats/drinks on their likely _unpaid_ break? Bet the comments aren\u2019t what you thought they would be lmao", "INFO: Would you have reacted the same way if it was a Diet Coke, which is also caffeinated?\n\nEdit: as an FYI for your answer, a 12 oz Diet Coke has 46 mg of caffeine and an 8 oz Red Bull has 77 mg.\n\nEdit2: Don't think I'm going to get a reply on this one. As with most posters who get a resounding YTA, OP is probably going underground. In any case, I think the point I was getting at was obvious. All caffeinated sodas have more caffeine in them than any child should drink. If you get bent out of shape over an \"energy drink\" and not a plain old Coke, you're being a complete hypocrite.\n\nMore importantly, YTA for making a mountain out of a molehill and making this woman's life harder. They're already keeping caffeinated drinks away from the kids. It's your job going forward to keep them away the rest of the time. Brand recognition will not be the downfall of your kid's diet. Bad parenting will.", "YTA\n\nHow was the teacher being rude? She simply told you that she was on her break when you confronted her; the fact you took that to mean she was 'not listening' and being rude is totally on you. \n\n>So I complained to the manager\n\nI know you think you were probably doing a good thing, but I can say with certainty that you are now 'That Parent' who the other teachers roll their eyes at. They have a million things to think about and be responsible for during their day, and I can *absolutely* guarantee that energy drinks are nowhere near their priority list. \n\n>I was in the shop my son pointed out the energy drink and was like \u201cteacher drinks those\u201d\n\nOkay, and? It isn't as though your son is going to rock up to a supermarket tomorrow and buy one for himself. You simply tell him that the drinks are for adults and move on with your life, because you cannot shelter him from every unhealthy thing that exists in this world.", "Absolutely YTA. You are responsible for setting the example for your child; his teacher is supposed to do that while she's working. She wasn't harming your child at all by having that drink, and if it comes up at the store, you can just tell him that \"we don't drink those in our family.\" Problem solved. Instead you decided you could control her.", "YTA.\n\nYou would be wise to tone down this part of your personality before your children start school. \"That parent\" sometimes rubs off on teacher's opinions of the kids, and you don't want to make it harder for your kids at school.", "Every day care I know has a wait list and a teacher shortage so I suspect I know where you sit on the organizations priority list.", "YTA.\n\nMaybe think about being a \"good role model\" for your son by demonstrating acceptance that different people make different choices and that's fine.", "YTA. As a parent, part of your job is to ensure that you are the main influence in your children's lives from day one. That means you are the one who needs to set the proper examples of behavior, etc. It seems as though you're willing to let the teacher be the main influence until she does something you disagree with. The fact that the director of the nursery actually moved the table indoors to accomodate your complaint is appalling to me. It says you have direct authority over the place, which you shouldn't have as you don't own and operate it. Also, your belief that it's more important for the teacher to engage with you than with your children is so wrong. She's there for the benefit of the kids, not your personal convenience. Her attentiveness to the kids shows she cares about them and takes proper care of them.", "YTA and I honestly hope that the nursery opts to discontinue services for your family. You have zero right to dictate what someone can have on their break. I hope that all of the staff who liked that seating area understands exactly who caused it to be lost which is you.", "Yta.", "YTA.", "YTA. \n\nIt's an energy drink not a Coors Light. She's on break. I hope she never eats a candy bar", "YTA. You completely overreacted, and now you'll likely dismiss everyone telling you as much.\n\nLeave the poor woman alone, she deals with a group of difficult children all day, and doesn't need to keep to the diet you prefer.", "YTA - there are all kinds of things adults do/have/say that kids can\u2019t. Just tell your son those are something for grownups", "YTA, absolutely. Mind your own damn business.", "YTA \n\nNo question about it, I\u2019m very careful what I do around children since I work with them myself. But drinking an energy drink is not a reason to annoy someone who is by your own definition great with the children\n\nIt\u2019d be different if she was showing behaviour that would endanger the children if copied like crossing the road on a red light. At least that\u2019s where I personally draw the line but I\u2019m guessing you let your children drink Coke every now and again which is instantly the same thing", "YTA. She\u2019s an adult. She can drink them if she wants. She\u2019s working with kids, I\u2019m sure other teachers drink energy drinks as well. Ground your helicopter, you helicopter snack police", "YTA\n\n>   \u2018But\u2019 I was in the shop and my son pointed out the energy drink and said teacher drinks those \n\nLike, you\u2019re giving that as some sort of, see, that\u2019s how truly awful this horrific situation is. \n\nI cannot imagine what knowing you is like, or what the staff think of you.\n\nParent your kid\u2026YOU teach them healthy snacks\n\nRead your title over and over, how was she being either rude nor a good (enough) role model?\n\nYou are the rude sanctimonious one", "This is ridiculous. YTA.", "YTA. I guess next you will be expecting to control what she eats in public restaurants as well. The fact that she takes care of your kid doesn't make her yours to control.", "YTA\nYou were very rude. I don't know in what world that you think that you have the right to police what other adults do on their own time. It's not like she was downing a bottle of wine.", "YTA why is an energy drink different than coffee?", "YTA There\u2019s a lot you\u2019re going to have to explain to your kid. Energy drinks are the least of it. Does anyone drink coffee around him? How do you explain that?", "YTA-it's not exactly the teacher's job to teach healthy eating and such in front of the kids, it's your job as parents to, it wasn't your business to try and dictate what and where she drinks, if she wants to be outside and drink an energy drink ON HER BREAK, she can. \n\nis it any different to when your kid sees you or their dad drink a beer or coffee or some wine at home? do you try to hide what you're drinking and eating in front of your kid?", "YTA. You are one of those parents that make teachers burn out. How would you like it if someone critiqued what you ate at work, like you ate a doughnut and they were on a diet? You're the parent, you should be able to explain to your child that your teacher can eat whatever she wants but your family makes healthy choices. And really, an energy drink? This is a problem? Wow.  And you complained to the manager!! I hope the manager just rolled his or her eyes after you left.         Think about this, C'mon.", "I once saw a teacher from my daughter\u2019s school out at a bar\u2026she was HORRIFIED and started to leave. I stopped her and bought her a couple of drinks. Why? Because she was on her OWN TIME and she owed me NOTHING. Much like this teacher was on her damn break. The audacity of OP thinking she has a right to dictate what this poor teacher drinks. YTA big time.", "YTA. Why are you policing that poor woman\u2019s drink on her break? As long as it\u2019s not alcool it doesn\u2019t concern you. She probably needs the energy drink because she\u2019s surrounded by little kids all day. Her manager should have stood up to her. And honestly energy drinks aren\u2019t that bad. Also, does that mean you nerve drink or eat anything that isn\u2019t appropriate for your kid around them? You never have wine or super spicy foods?", "My friend used to catch crap from her students (8 or 9 years old) if she had a cup of coffee, because their parents told them good people don't drink it. You will raise judgmental children if you don't redirect your attitude towards other people. Let the teacher live her life.", "No one believes that your son said that. YTA for being controlling for no good reason.", "I feel a deep hate for you OP. Many of my friends and relatives are or have been teachers. Without doubt YTA and much much worse.", "You are the kind of parent that made me quit teaching. No joke.", "YTA\u2014it\u2019s not another adult\u2019s job to be a role model.", "YTA im assuming that you never eat anything unhealthy correct? You\u2019ve never smoked, drank, ate fast food ever? You sound entitled to think you can control another person and you sound pretentious", "YTA. \n\nImagine every time some person, who has no children, made it a point to make note of every thing they felt was a parental failure. Maybe you don't read to your kids enough, or you don't read the right books. Maybe you don't structure their play time enough, or you have it overly structured so that your child can't learn critical thinking and problem solving. And this childless \"perfect parent\" vocally points out everything they think you are doing wrong. Maybe they tell everyone in your friend group what a terrible parent you are. Then they are so self-righteous, they start blasting you on the internet. \n\nHow frustrating does that sound? \n\nThis is exactly what you are doing to a teacher. You do not teach in her classroom.  You are not a teacher at this daycare. You need to keep your opinions to yourself.", "YTA\n\nIf you are worried about energy drinks you got a world full of worst crap coming your way.  You need to loosen up and understand you can\u2019t control everyone and everything other people are doing, especially when they are on break.", "YTA I feel for your kids teachers in the future when they go to primary school.

Grow  up", "Parents like you were the reason I only lasted a year in the daycare. I loved the kids, hated the parents.

And 2) I was helping to get her potty trained so she wasn\u2019t even using as many diapers anyways. She decided to blame another teacher when I spoke to her directly about her \u201c concerns\u201d.

This woman comes back in from her break and is *on* for your child and many others. She probably needs a certain amount of caffeine to do it, at least. And there she was, on her break, doing her allotted bit of self-care to make sure she could get through her shift, but you had to come be judgy. \n\nOne parent to another, yes, you are TA.

You need to say thank you for your job and apologize, and yes, even offer her next one.", "YTA. If your kid asked about it. You explain it to them.

It\u2019s just an energy drink. Not crack.", "YTA. Adults can drink what they want. Hell I\u2019m certain teachers in school setting at all grade levels here have consumed energy drinks in front of all three of our kids. Happy to report our 17 year old, 15 year old, and 8 year haven\u2019t ever felt the need to drink them. Closest they\u2019ve gotten? Gatorade zero.

A few years ago, there was a news story that was really big here about a woman writing a negative Yelp review of the local Coldstone because the teenage girl who served them was a little bigger. She described in detail how the sight of this girl made her lose her appetite, made her worried that her children will never want to eat ice cream again, and she had to teach her children to not eat TOO much ice cream, all because of the employee. Some articles had pictures of the employee, and I honestly have no idea what she was so worked up about. The store owner replied to the Yelp review calling the author out because she apparently made the comments about not eating too much ice cream in front of the employee, who was not only hurt, but had also seen the Yelp review. \n\nOne question many people asked in regard to that situation was \"if she's that goddamn pressed about her kids gaining weight from eating ice cream, why is she as the mother taking them to an ice cream parlor? Why is it 100% the employee's job to make sure her kids aren't wanting to eat too much ice cream?\" I have the same question for you. Have you ever drank an energy drink in front of your children? A soda? Alcohol? Have you ever eaten ice cream or potato chips in front of them? If you have, why is it 100% the teacher's job to teach the kids healthy eating habits and be a good role model?

Daycare teachers are people. Sometimes they need an energy drink. Get over yourself.", "YTA, you are a parent out of a teachers nightmares. Get a grip.", "This reminds me of that Christian lady explaining why monster is satanic", "YTA and the exact reason a lot of teachers quit their profession.\n\nCertainly.hope you don't consume anything that isn't perfectly healthy in front of your children", "YTA\n\nShe was on her break, she can do what she wants. You are unbelievably arrogant. \n\nIf she'd have been drinking a coffee you wouldn't have had a problem. An energy drink is no different, you're just a snob.", "YTA. So you never drink in front of your kids? Dad never does? No beer in the house, wine? What about coffee? Caffeine isn\u2019t good for children either.", "YTA wtf the entitlement of you thinking you can tell this teacher what to do is off the charts", "YTA . Get a grip. She\u2019s not smoking or drinking a beer.", "YTA", "YTA you don't get to control other people and its a energy drink ffs its not alchohol if it was it would be a different story but a energy drink harms nobody not even a child and not everyone has the energy to deal with children all day without being tired its a drink that has caffine and sugar in to add energy atleast shes not doing meth infront of kids or other drugs if you can't deal with someone needing to drink something you dislike go somewhere else your child can go elsewhere to instead of you being an awful person to others also drinking a energy drink doesn't make anyone a bad role model if anyone is the bad role model its you", "YTA, entitled much? Stop trying to control how adults behave around your kids, it's so overbearing! If you want to teach them things, teach them without asking other people to change. It's how real life works!\n\nNo wonder we have problem having teachers with arsehole parents like you!\n\nBe a grown up and apologize, teach your kids a lesson on apologizing and let others be themselves!", "YTA. Yikes, healthy choices is a parents job.", "Not only are you the asshole but you're an utter loser. You're annoyed because, what...she's shy and drinks caffeine? Fuck off.", "I once asked a parent from a kindergarden I worked at for a cigarette. It was like 9 in the morning and I was blackout drunk and drugged up. I was horrified when I realized who I just asked, but they just laughed it off and where cool with it, if not slightly amused that I didn't recognized them. Berlin is wild YTA obviously", "YTA\n\nCompletely over the top response. It\u2019s one thing if she was smoking or doing shots in front of the kids, but you\u2019re worked up about an energy drink???", "YTA you're the reason people find parents obnoxious and irritating.

Oh my god, you are why people are leaving my profession in droves.", "Ah its *that parent*.\n\nYTA your children are not allowed wine either.  Do you go around at weddings telling the guests not to drink wine in front of your precious babies?  \n\nGet a grip.", "YTA \nIt is none of your business if she wants to drink energy drinks. You sound like an entitled insufferable overbearing helicopter mom. Also you heard her through the bathroom door and what stepped closer to listen in on a private convo.

YTA", "Yes, now being shy is an unprofessional trait. Ffs.", "I drink coffee and operate my coffee machine in front of my toddler. Someone going to arrest me for this?", "Agreed, teaching is a hard job, and if this post is from the UK which I'm gathering from some of the phrases then an apprentice nursery worker is most definitely underpaid and overworked. If OP wants to mold a perfect role model for her son then her and her entitled husband should hire an au pair and free up that nursery spot for one of the dozens of other parents on the wait list.", "Oh no, now she has to explain to her kids that some things are just for adults.
