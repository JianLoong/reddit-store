NO MEANS NO!", "NTA\n\nIf she is actually interested in your well being, she would look into other ways for you to cope but not try to bring you back together with a cheating partner.  \nTelling someone a beloved pet is going to be put down, just to trick someone, is very, VERY low and calling her just a manipulative meddler is actualy soft in my opinion.", "NTA\n\nas a sister/relative/friend, why would you ever want someone you care about to get back together with a cheater? thats not healthy for you. In addition to that, why would she work with the cheater to set you up? its all weird and honestly if it were me as the sister i\u2019d reconsider my friendship with a \u201cbest friend\u201d who would beg to date my sibling and YET cheat. says alot about her character.", "She wanted what was best for you? So, in her mind what is best for you is putting you back with her manipulative cheating friend. She didn't care about you, your pain only her friend. See it for what it is. Her loyalty is to her friend not you.", "NTA. Tell your sister to stay in her lane.", "NTA\n\nShe asked and you said no. And then she totally disrespected you by ignoring your wishes by trying to set you up.\n\nYou should point out to both of them that now that they've done that, if anything really does happen to the cat, you won't be there because they've already destroyed your trust by lying to you in order to manipulate you. What a shitty thing for them to have done.", "NTA\nBoth ur sister and the ex are massive AH. Also tell ur sister to not interfere with your life because she clearly has no idea what's \"best\" for u", "NTA.\n\nI cannot say what your sister is thinking. Maybe she genuinely believes it what she says, maybe she has other motives. But she needs to keep her nose out of that. You pushed back, nothing wrong with that. She should stay as neutral as possible in this matter.\n\nEdit: what is she thinking about her friend cheating on you?", "I NFO: What happened to that \"another guy\" Anna slept with? Because it's weird to ask for an another chance when she's already with someone else... Did she want to cheat on him for you as well? Or did he discovered that she cheated on you?\n\nIn any case, smart move (sarcasm, btw) from your sister and Anna to lure you into Anna's house by telling that the cat would be \"put down\", when in fact the cat is perfectly fine.\n\nAnd she expected a second chance with you after her cheating on you, and telling you a lie about her cat health? To lure you into her place? Is she out of her mind right now?\n\nAnd your sister is going along with her?\n\nThey deserve each other.

Also it is actually very manipulative and also kind of odd she would side with someone who cheated on her brother. Shows clearly she doesn't have your back.", "INFO. What does the sister say about Anna cheating on you?", "NTA. If your sister desperately wanted you to get back together and has reason to believe that would benefit you then she could have found other ways to get you both talking. I think she needs to respect your wishes and take no for an answer but whatever happened to people just inviting both people to a restaurant on the pretence of a 1:1 dinner and then not showing up? Telling you the cat was going to be put down shows a total disregard for your feelings and gives me the impression she just likes the idea of her brother and her bestie being together forever and doesn\u2019t actually care whether you\u2019re happy or not. She needs to grow up and you were well within your rights to call her out for her meddling and her dirty manipulation tactic. I guess it depends partially on the circumstances but it strikes me as disloyal that she\u2019s still so close to this friend after she cheated on you.", "NTA. It sounds like she is both manipulative and a meddler. Her intentions might be good but the way she completely disregards your autonomy, lies and assumes she knows what you want better than you is not good.\n\nIf I were you, I would openly say \"You violated my trust. Until you gain it back, I will not believe any information from you without outside confirmation\".", "NTA ones a cheater one is an enabler. 2 reasons not to talk to them for a while, or for a while longer", "NTA. Idk what exactly she means by 'coping', but I doubt it's about the break up and more about the reason for the break up.", "NTA the relationship has ended her and Anna need to accept that.", "Getting back to together with a manipulative cheater is a good thing? Nah, your sister wants what\u2019s best for her, not you.", "NTA. If your sister thinks Anna is such a catch, she can have her all to herself.", "NTA. Your sister is trying to play god, and arrogantly thinks she knows everything. Tell her that her lies and manipulation make it hard for you to trust her, and you will have to verify things in future. Ask if she wants everyone to know she's a scheming liar.", "NTA. You and no one else decides what\u2019s best for you. Anna cheated on you before and lied along with your sister to try and get you back so how would you be able to trust her? The title is a good description but you could add liar in there too.", "NTA, Your sister is psycho.", "NTA\n\nyour sis is delusional and a liar and honestly sick. \n\nIf she really wanted ur best she would drop that disgusting friend who cheated on her brother.", "NTA- It's not your sister's place to decide what is best for you, and that was a 7th grade level bullshit stunt that she pulled. It was manipulative. It was meddling. If she doesn't want to be called that, then she should stop being a manipulative meddler. What she did was disrespectful. She needs to learn that other people's relationships are not her business.", "NTA - Ask your sister why she doesn't care that her friend hurt you.\n\nIf I was her I would no longer be friends with someone who cheater on my sibling. She cares more about her friend than you.", "NTA.", "NTA that was a super manipulative move. Her friend hurt you deeply and they both need to leave you alone.", "NTA \n\nAsk your sister if she thinks Anna will sleep with your sister's boyfriend.  Tell her it's only a matter of time before it happens.  Let her know you won't laugh at her when it does.  I expect your sister lacks empathy and won't fully realize how painful this is until she is cheated on.   Then she'll be sorry but that doesn't help you now.", "NTA manipulative and not very bright either. The thought process was \u201coh he\u2019s going to go over there, see the cat is ok, and instead of questioning things will fall for the cheater again.\u201d", "\"How is being stuck with a lying cheater best for me? Do you really think she's as good as I'll get?\"\n\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nGood for calling her our like it is. I wonder how people in her situation can think that this is ok to do??\n\nWhat I come up with is lack of empathy. Because she likely wouldn't like the same treatment done to her.", "You sister is a manipulative meddler AND an idiot. Why would she think going back to a cheater is a good thing for you? Birds of the same feather flock together, ask you sister if she thinks cheating is ok.", "NTA", ">You're taking the breakup badly, I know what would cheer you up! **going back to the person who treated you like garbage**! It was only one little mistake and not a series of deliberate actions that she only regretted after getting caught. \n\nGetting caught is the *one little mistake*. I don't like my brother, but anyone who did that to him would be flat out dead to me.", "She probably likes Anna more than OP and has some delusion of OP and Anna getting married so that they can finally be sisters. \n\nI've cut off friends for cheating before. If one of them did it to my brother of all people, they'd be dead to me.", "Anna said that he was \u2018just a meaningless hook up.\u2019", "My sister calls it \u2018One time mistake.\u2019", "So she cheated on you for \"just a meaningless hook up\". And apparently it was a one time mistake, by your other comment... I don't trust her.\n\nNTA", "The fact your sister is siding with your ex on this and not protecting you as her brother is very telling.\n\nIt's never a \"one time mistake\" if she cheated on you once she would do it again.", "That's a very lame excuse.  If her BF cheated on her, would that be a one time mistake.  Your sis is wrong and is taking her friend over you.  NTA", "yeah until hit happens again. then its a only a two time mistake"]}
