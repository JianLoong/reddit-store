{"id": 26871, "submission_id": "16ivbbo", "title": "AITA for telling my husband that I don\u2019t want his present?", "selftext": "Sorry for the long post but I am so numb & don\u2019t know who to talk to.\n\nOver the last 5-6 years I(36f) have gotten my husband (35m) birthday lunches, Framed photos of his art, a website that I made of all his work,  microphone & amplifier, Apple Watch, leather jacket. A small party on a boat, a private sea side dinner. These were always along with cakes & cards. I am not rich. I just save for him. \n\nHe did nothing for my first 3-4 birthdays, or any other life events. Then for the 4th year he sent me $15 gift directly from the seller & not even wrapped.\n\n\nThe 4th year I told him that he either reciprocated properly or we are done. That year he buys me jewellery & flowers on valentines but does nothing again for my birthday. We fight again so he admits that he didn\u2019t have much money but promises to fix it & sends me cake & flowers the next day.\n\n\n5th year he goes all out sends me a coach bag, flowers, cake & everything & I am overjoyed. & he promises me that he will celebrate me all the time & manage his planning better. & I told him that if money is short then we must communicate.\n\n\nHe recently released a successful music video. So I booked him a private sea side dinner with 5 courses of his favourite food, a very expensive perfume, the restaurant played his music. Then he does nothing for Valentine\u2019s Day. \n\n\nThis year for his birthday I buy him a $450 jacket that he had mentioned wanting & a cake.\n\n\nNow for my birthday last week he surprised me at midnight with cake & flowers but next day we did nothing till the evening so I was pretty sad. But at 5 pm he surprised me by calling my parents & sisters for tea & he got me a second cake, I see my parents every other weekend so I was kinda hoping for a romantic date that he hasn\u2019t taken me on since our wedding. I told myself that it\u2019s enough & I must be grateful.\n\n\nBut the next day my sister told me that he had told her that \u201cher gift is on its way\u201d.  So my hopes suddenly got up again & I started getting excited.\n\nToday I asked him what my present was, & he said he had ordered me a pair of jbl headphones. But the order had gotten cancelled 3 times. I was so heartbroken- because I could tell he was lying & there was no present or no order- so I said I don\u2019t want it coz I have my own. I didn\u2019t fight at all today. Now he is being distant.\n\n\nThe reason I am mentioning the cost of products is because He often gets the finest things for himself & I feel like an afterthought. What hurts the most is that there is a designer belt sitting near our door since a month that he ordered for himself. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s lack of money.  I have seen him browse watches for his friends wedding months in advance.\nMy sister says that I was an asshole after he planned such a nice birthday for me. I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her that he lied to her about my present.\n\nAdditional info: Thank you to everyone who empathised with me and understood that it\u2019s not the lack material things that\u2019s hurting me. It\u2019s the breaking of promises. I am sorry that so many of you have gone through it yourself.\n\nAnd to everyone calling me materialistic. I don\u2019t expect ANY other person to get any gifts or plans for me. Not even the guys I dated before him. But my husband was the first person whom I started expecting this from because I saw how much he loves shopping and he made promises of spoiling me. EVERY SINGLE present or plan I got him was related to his art, passions and wants. I don\u2019t want him to spend a certain amount, I just want a non generic birthday or Valentine\u2019s Day or a professional win. I too got promoted twice in 4 years. \n\nI am not rich, but I am not poor either. I am actually very disciplined with money that\u2019s how I manage to save for presents. I spoil my parents, his parents, my siblings and his siblings, and would never ever ever expect them to get me ANYTHING in return. I guess the reason I spent so much on him is because he is the most valuable to me. But I don\u2019t think I am to him. \n\nThe first time I ever fought with him was when he sought my help to choose a wedding present for his best friend 2 months in advance. That made me realise that he does care and can plan, just not for me.", "created_utc": 1694728784, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ivbbo/aita_for_telling_my_husband_that_i_dont_want_his/", "score": 1040, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This guy is putting in so little effort, and only tries a little after you practically beg him.\n\nYou deserve so much better. Even if he doesn't have a lot of money, he can plan things to do with you. You can go on cheap romantic dates, and gifts don't have to be all about the monetary value - he just seems to buy basic stuff that you would get for someone you don't really know. In addition to this, you are going absolutely all out for someone who won't put in a fraction of your effort. \n\nAt the very least, I would stop spending so much money on him.", "Dear- you are an afterthought.

He could have at least brought you flowers your first few birthdays.", "NTA: I hope he shows you consideration in other ways.   Doing things for you,  giving you compliments... but the fact that you haven't been on dates is indeed sad.\n\nThe gifts don't need to equal but he does need to be doing SOMETHING to make you feel appreciated.  It sounds like you've communicated the issue to him so he's not just unaware.\n\nI'm really sorry :(", "NTA. You're his \"cheap\" squeeze. But the money is going somewhere...", "NTA. He doesn't care about you. He has been telling you that for years.", "No applicable judgement. This feels like it might be out of the scope of your average reditor and more appropriate for a couples counselor I think.", "NTA unless we are talking about to yourself. \n\nIf your love language is gifts and it is not reciprocated, then why are you with him? There has to be a point when you say enough. Every gift giving occasion he is telling you that he doesn't care about you and that he only cares about himself. Why can't you see that you married a selfish fellow? \n\nStop already with the gifts. If you want something, buy it for yourself. You can pretend it's from him but really would that be healthy?", "NTA for saying you don\u2019t want his present, but YTA to yourself for staying with someone who spends their money and time on everyone but you. That was a big red flag. I tried to get my now-ex-husband to care for years, until I realized  that someone who doesn\u2019t care on their own is just never going to. \n\nNTA for wanting caring attention and presents, but YTA to yourself for expecting a man in his mid-thirties to change and suddenly appreciate you. He\u2019s made it very clear just how much attention he\u2019s willing to give to himself and to friends, compared to you. \n\nWhen I was in a situation similar to yours (the gift part at least, he also spent money on himself), I really started to notice towards the end how many other aspects of our life didn\u2019t \u201cadd up\u201d. Do the two of you split household chores/cooking/pet care evenly? Does one of you have to be frequently reminded to do chores the other one does automatically?", "NTA.  Okay, so I\u2019ve been married a long freakin\u2019 time.  Decades.  My DH stinks at gift giving.  It\u2019s just not important to him.  He doesn\u2019t really care if he gets any either.  He gave me exactly nothing for my last birthday.  Not even an old receipt with \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d scrawled on the back.  Drives me crazy.  The thing is, he shows he loves me and cares in other ways.  I haven\u2019t had to check my own oil in years.  He\u2019s an involved father and an all around good guy.  The lack of thought on occasion may bother me but everything else makes up for it.  You just need to look at your relationship as a whole.  What else does he do for you?  He\u2019s not going to change.  Do you want to live with him the rest of your life?  Does he make you feel valued in other ways?  Only you know if this is worth it.", "NTA\n\nI was tempted to put N A H but in the end your husband really isn't putting enough effort when you've made it clear that this matters to you. \n\nThe reason I was tempted to put N A H though is because I thought your husband belongs more to the type of people that me and my husband are. We don't really care about special 'dates' because we don't find them to be any more special than each day we spend with each other. We don't do special things for Valentines or birthdays or anniversaries. \n\n**BUT** the part that makes me feel like your husband is the AH is because we may not celebrate special days but we also just constantly surprise each other instead and show special consideration to each other on a regular basis.  We don't need a special day to tell us when to shower each other with love and gifts.\n\nIf your husband doesn't do that on a regular basis and doesn't celebrate special days that you made clear meant a lot to you then yea he's an asshole. I'd say stop going to above and beyond for him. Next time throw him a card and cake if he's happy with that then you have a ton more personal funds to spend on yourself and treat yourself; since he won't.", "NTA. And here's a pro tip. Stop planning these lavish gifts for him and start planning them for yourself. Wrap them up, post them to yourself, make it special, go all out. Then when he asks who sent you those gifts say you got them for yourself because you knew he wouldn't bother. Shame him. He should be ashamed. It's not even about the value of the gifts. It's the lack of acknowledgement, thoughtfulness and planning for the woman who's supposed to be the love of his life.", "NTA because you've repeatedly communicated that putting effort and consideration into things is important to you. If he doesn't want to do it that's fine but please stop disrespecting yourself this way. Don't let anyone convince you that you're not worth it. I suggest couples therapy if you aren't looking to let go yet. If he can't agree to do that for you then you know there's nothing left there worth fighting for.", "Stop doing for him! Let him feel what it feels like \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA", "Sounds like you married a narcissist! My ex always got himself the best things and ignored me.", "NTA but how are you married and don't know each others financial situations? That is insane to me.  \nHe doesn't seem to care enough and he can lie to your face, not really gonna get better from there hun.", "NTA.Return the energy he gives you. See how long it takes him to notice.", "Um NTA but also you guys need to just not do gifts. If he's a perfect partner in every other regard he might just not express his love that way. (To clarify, after you asked, he should have communicated this instead of failing to do better)\n\nMy bf and I agreed ages ago we're only gonna do gifts on birthdays, and have a $50 budget, and it's been great.", "He treats you more like a roommate than a wife.", "I think you should reconsider this marriage. He doesn\u2019t put in much effort even when he knows it\u2019s important to you. This happens again and again and he\u2019s started to lie about it. It\u2019s going to get worst as time goes by. I think you should find someone else who values you. It\u2019s not even about the dollar value but the utter lack of interest or enthusiasm. I\u2019ve seen more enthusiasm at a laundromat.", "NTA\n\nI think you are not being appreciated by him, and he takes you for granted.  \nI would explore other ways to live.", "The only way he is going to learn is if you do to him as he does to you. Stop buying him nice things get him a cake and a card.", "As a man who thinks gift exchanges are pointless and a huge waste of money, I'm going to say YTA. Gifts clearly aren't his thing, and you're putting a lot of stress on him. I'd seriously reconsider our relationship if my gf said I had to get her presents or else we were done. \n\n\"Here, I spent $500 on something you may or may not like.\"\n\n\"And I spent $500 on something you may or may not like because you said we'd break up if I didn't, my love\"", "I'm swinging between N-T-A and N-A-H here. I used to go all-out 'extravagant' (within my means) for my now-ex - things he mentioned a year ago that he liked or wanted that I filed away in my mind to be of use later on. Nothing particularly expensive; I just wanted him to know that I'd been listening to him all along and these gifts were personal and from the heart. I always went OTT with the wrapping and delivery because I LOVE that feeling when someone who loves you presents you with a stunningly wrapped gift that clearly took you some time to create, even if the gift itself is just an experience voucher or a baby bonsai tree or a water-pressure-increasing shower head because his shower is TERRIBLE (he almost cried over that one!). \n\nHe was always ecstatic, but his contribution on MY birthdays was about as low-effort you can possibly get. I'd ask if he'd planned anything for my birthday and he'd kinda snort and say \"No?!?\" like it was a daft question to ask, which I guess it was in hindsight because that man is too lazy to even organise a f*ck at an orgy. So I'd suggest we go out for a quiet dinner just the two of us someplace romantic....and yet I would be the one to scout the menus, pick the place and make the reservations. And he'd just show up. Sometimes with a card, sometimes with a baffling gift unrelated to my interests or even what I'm like as a person, but most often with nothing. \n\nAfter four years of this, I noped out and simply walked away. I don't need or want expensive gifts or material stuff, but I DO VERY MUCH WANT a partner who respects me and listens to me and knows me well enough that he can think of some simple things that I'd love for my birthday and bothers to get them or arrange them for me, like I did for him. And he just didn't. For me, it wasn't money (\"I need you to spend X thousand on me to prove you love me!\" Yeah, no); it was simply due care and attention. If you're not even listening to my daily chatter about this cool place I'd like to visit or that weird pop-up eatery I'd like to try, can't think of a thing to buy me that I'd like as a gift (like new beach towels I said were getting worn out, or a silver charm - not even gold! - for my bracelet), you're either not even listening to me, in which case why are you in this relationship pretending to care anyway?!, or you're so apathetic about me that you can't be bothered to make even the barest effort unless explicitly NAGGED into it. And that is NOT romantic! \n\nI'll go with NTA here, but it's conditional: you ditch this guy and start treating YOURSELF with love and value, or you are T.A.: to yourself. I think you know it's time to choose. \n\nGood luck. \u2764 \n\n(Edited for typos. I was good and mad on OP's behalf!)", "YTA\n\nOnly because you already know he's not going to reciprocate your gifts at anywhere near the level of your gifts for him.\n\nYou have to figure out if you're going to\n\n1. Keep doing lavish things for him while he has to be reminded to get a dollar store card and grocery store cake for you and be happy with that.\n\n2. Stop getting him gifts because you know he's not going to give you gifts.\n\n3. Do less lavish gifts -- dollar store card and grocery store cake.\n\n4. Divorce and find someone who will reciprocate events with you.", "NAH. But softly Y T A. These gifts are obviously in neither of your budget, and are both on seperate pages priority wise when it comes to gift giving. I think you need to have a think about why gifts are so important to you. Maybe in the future, communicate better, pool your savings, and do things together as a joint gift to yourselves instead of allowing yourself to get disappointed every time.", "YTA Gift giving shouldn\u2019t be transactional. It sounds like you buy gifts and plan occasions not for the joy of doing so, but to put people in your debt.\n\nIf I were your husband I would have given up. Nothing he does meets your expectations. Two cakes, flowers and tea with your family wasn\u2019t good enough. The gift he got you wasn\u2019t good enough. Why should he bother trying?\n\nI buy more things for my husband than he does for me and I plan for special occasions. He sucks at gift giving and planning special occasions. If I want a gift I order it and put it on his credit card. If I want to go out I text him the website of the restaurant and ask him to make reservations. I appreciate him for his strengths, being loyal, kind and affectionate.", "You\u2019re literally the asshole because you keep buying shit for him. At your big age, when will you learn?? YTA", "EHS\n\nAnd here\u2019s why:\n-When a person gives gifts, it is not a transactional thing. It should be give and expect nothing in return. If your love language is objects and material things, make it clear as crystal to whoever needs to hear it. What you are describing is a transactional relationship, as opposed to unconditional love.\n\n-If you are not getting what you need from this person, take a big ol\u2019 step back and recognize the relationship for what it is: a dead kitten. Stay with me for a second. My mentor used this analogy in a scene study and directing class. To use their words: \u201cit\u2019s a dead kitten- it\u2019s cute, but it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Take the lesson, and try to move forward without this person.", "I absolutely disagree with other comments. He has tried to do nice things for your birthday but because there was no gift you criticized him? You are absolute greedy self-centered asshole. YTA", "YTA (probably)\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of room for nuance here but my gut instinct is that you and your husband have different ways of expressing your love for each other. You clearly like both giving and receiving gifts. And you haven\u2019t given any indication of how he typically expresses affection (other than, obviously, not gifts) but it\u2019s possible that he prefers to show his affection through acts of service or quality time. \n\nThe biggest swing to the side of YTA is that you\u2019re so focused on keeping score, as evidenced by you listing the price of every gift you have ever given each other. Even when he does get you gifts and surprises, you seem to think they are insignificant because they don\u2019t happen often enough, or because you have given him something more ostentatious. A lot of the gifts you\u2019ve mentioned giving him are not things he has asked you to do, they are things you chose to do. You can\u2019t be over here saying \u201cI voluntarily spent hundreds of dollars on you so you must do at least the same for me\u201d. That\u2019s very entitled. \n\nAlso, you have assumed he lied about your birthday gift. Do you have proof? \n\nOverall you would probably benefit from some couples therapy to sort this out in a healthy way and set some expectations on both sides. I imagine he\u2019s probably also frustrated that when he tries to give you what you want, you whine to the internet that he didn\u2019t spend enough.", "YTA\n\nWhy do you spend so much on each other? Does your relationship have a price tag? Is the only way you both can express how much you love each other is by expensive gifts? It sounds like a transactional marriage.\n\nYou actually told him if he did spend big on presents for your birthday that you would divorce him?\n\nI don't spend that much on my wife for her birthday and she doesn't on me. Some of the best presents she has given me have been inexpensive.", "Info: do you know for sure he lied?", "Sounds like you completely different love languages.  Outside of birthdays and holidays, does he treat you well?  Hard to really judge everything when you are only talking about birthdays ... Maybe his cat has a chronic eye problem ...", "INFO: what are your income levels, expense levels, etc?", "Some people are just not so excited about birthdays and Valentine\u2019s Day. Maybe he just doesn\u2019t share the same excitement that you do. Instead of getting angry and forcing him to do things, why don\u2019t you two talk about it and come to some mutual understanding.", "INFO: does he expect these gifts from you? Or is this your way of showing of love while he shows love in a different way?", "You let him treat you that way, so why are you on Reddit asking if you\u2019re the asshole?", "NTA, doesn't materialism breed happiness?", "Im kinda on the fence between ESH or none of you are, but im leaning towards no one is an AH, mainly because both you seem to have different ways, of communicating or expressing love. \n\nYours it evidently gift giving due to the fact that everything that has been said is with regards to gifts. And on a side note, in a relationship it tends to be best to not keep score on who is doing what when and how, that will only build up resentment, and makes the relationship more transaction based rather than emotional, ( i.e. she got me this so i must get her this, he did this for me so i have to do this for him).\n\n In a relationship you all should br giving equally, having different ways of giving is fine as long as both parties are truly showing their affection in their own way, without harming the other person. But with that said in life there are compromises, so sometimes we must accept that this is just how are partner is and if its something we can not live with or tolerate for a long time we should sit down and talk with them and express how we feel. You did mention that after talking to him about it he did step up his game and brought you things that are more to your liking. This goes to show that money might not be a problem with regards to the price tag of the gifts ( but since he is in music and i dont know your finances, we redditors cant say for certain whether he is being frugal with you, he doesnt have any money, or how capable is he at managing his finances. I believe its the later since you mentioned he has been planning better.)\n\nAll in all talk to him again and explain to him how important well thought out gifts are to you, and how you enjoy when he gets you something you really like because it shows that he cares. It does suck that we must remind our spouses what we like and dislike amd what we want but us humans are forgetful by nature and tend to make mistakes. I want to believe your problem is more due to a communication problem rather than one not loving the either.", "ESH you for keeping score of presents; and him for being unacceptably thoughtless. I think it's hopeles so I suggest you stop saving up to buy him presents and instead get yourself something wonderful on your birthda - I'd aim for something Coco.", "YTA. Sounds like you do all that not out of pure love but to get presents back. Save yourself the trouble of EXPECTING gifts and spend that money on yourself. Problem solved.", "YTA. You don't keep track of how much you spent on your gifts to him and how much he spent on his gifts to you. it sounds very materialistic and business like. It's birthday, not a business transaction. I know that probably it's not the case, but it makes you sound entitled. Probably you're not and you're just upset, but the way you describe the situation makes you sound like it.\n\nAt least, he remembers your birthday. Mine needs to be reminded that it's my birthday a couple of days before the event because when I didn't remind him, he forgot and our kid told him it was my birthday and he started apologising in any way he could because he'd forgotten about it. we've been together for nearly 20 years so it's not as if he didn't have enough time to learn when my birthday was.", "NAH.

That year he buys me jewellery & flowers on valentines but does nothing again for my birthday. We fight again so he admits that he didn\u2019t have much money but promises to fix it & sends me cake & flowers the next day.\n5th year he goes all out sends me a coach bag, flowers, cake & everything & I am overjoyed. & he promises me that he will celebrate me all the time & manage his planning better. & I told him that if money is short then we must communicate.\nHe recently released a successful music video. So I booked him a private sea side dinner with 5 courses of his favourite food, a very expensive perfume, the restaurant played his music. Then he does nothing for Valentine\u2019s Day. \nThis year for his birthday I buy him a $450 jacket that he had mentioned wanting & a cake.\nNow for my birthday last week he surprised me at midnight with cake & flowers but next day we did nothing till the evening so I was pretty sad. But at 5 pm he surprised me by calling my parents & sisters for tea & he got me a second cake, I see my parents every other weekend so I was kinda hoping for a romantic date that he hasn\u2019t taken me on since our wedding. I told myself that it\u2019s okay & I must be grateful.\nNext day my sister told me that he had told her that \u201cher gift is on its way\u201d.  So my hopes suddenly got up again & I started getting excited.\nToday asked him what my present was, & he said he had ordered me a pair of jbl headphones. But the order had gotten cancelled 3 times.

What hurts the most is that there is a designer belt sitting near our door since a month that he had ordered for himself. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s lack of money.

Your view of gifting is very transactional. Those lavish gifts you gifted him came with huge expectation of being reciprocated. Not cool. You should only gift because you want to, not because you want something back. Seems like you gift not for the happiness of the receiver but for making yourself feel good (oh look I'm a good person, I bought this expensive item that I maybe can't afford so I look like a super caring wife). He never asked for those gifts. Honestly, he has tried to meet your expectations but nothing satisfy you. A flower and a cake and dinner with your family is not enough?? No wonder he stopped trying. It's just too much stress. You said it's the thought that counts but seems like if it's not expensive/special gifts it doesn't count.\n\nSecond.Your love language is clearly gift. But do you know his love language? My husband is not a gift person. His gifting love language score is fukin 0. You would assume someone with a 0 gift score would be indifferent when getting a gift. Wrong. Gifts annoy him so much. He'd rather people just don't give him anything, especially anything lavish. Birthday gift is a waste of money in his mind. Don't even think about valentine or other trivial dates. On the other hand, gifting is quite high in my love language. It was harsh in the beginning but I have learned that if there's anything I want I NEED to ask him to buy me that thing. If you don't communicate your expectations, how is he to understand? If he doesn't care about gift, it would be the last thing on his mind. Remind him that an important date is coming and communicate your expectations (flower, cake, reservations in a restaurant you want, invite your family or not, etc). I understand that it sucks to feel like he doesn't care about you but you need to train him to care of you in the way you wanted. It's not automatic if it's not his love language. \n\nThird. How is he in other aspects of your relationship? Does he treat you well? Is he a good person in general? If the answer is yes, then please learn not to put too much expectation in this gift thing or train him to understand. Don't put him down by being disappointed and rejecting his gift after he tried. Show that you appreciate him trying and encourage him to do more gradually. If the answer is no, he's not a good partner in general, girl, why are you still there? Respect yourself and walk away. \n\nFourth. This is the ESH part. You both don't seem to be in a situation that allows you to spend on lavish gifts. You said you have to save to buy him those gifts. The money might be better used for something more important. You both are staying with parents but he's wearing designer belt and browsing for watch? He definitely does not need expensive perfume or $450 jacket that you bought him. You buying him expensive gifts is one thing, but expecting him to reciprocate even tho you know he might be struggling financially is not cool (even tho he doesn't seem to know how to budget either). And how are you both married but you have no idea about his financial situation?", "In my humble opinion, you\u2019re not getting even bare minimum from him. Please re-evaluate. Put all that love and energy you put into him, back into yourself. I think once you do? You\u2019re gonna find that there is no room in your life for a person who treats you like this. Of course, NTA.", "Just stop buying him shit. He clearly doesn\u2019t care about it.", "NTA/leaning on NAH. \n\nFor me, this seems to be a huge difference of love languages/ how bdays and holidays are handled. As someone who seriously lacks in the gift giving side of love languages: I am genuinely intimidated by your absolute gift (pun very intended) of gift giving. \n\nOut of (relevant) curiosity do you think your husband shows his love language in different ways? Have you guys done quizzes together and talked openly about your differences in how you show love? For me, it seems that while he\u2019s making an effort it\u2019s not where you\u2019re *looking* for effort to be made. \n\nI would like to encourage you to not retract your love language of gift giving- but maybe open up venues of conversation where you can examine what\u2019s important to each of you.

We had good celebrations and then there was times we were counting change to get gas and a gallon of milk till payday. All we could afford was to say I love you and sit and spend time in each other's company.

I dated a guy like that who never really cared about my birthdays, special days, etc. and always gave me gifts that were something HE wanted.

You also mentioned in a different response you guys dont have bills you live with his parents and the house has \u201cstaff\u201d you also mentioned a lack of effort due to \u201clack of money, distance or loss\u201d You even talk about the cost of these headphones which \u201ccan be found at the local supermarket for $40 bucks\u201d when the price of the gift was not relevant. ALL YOU do is talk about money and the cost of things and how much you spend on him and spoil his mom with dates and gifts. Did you marry him because you knew his parents are rich? You didnt want to lose out on your golden ticket the first four years so you demanded he make good on your four year investment thus far and you wanted to see some positive returns on investment.", "Let\u2019s break down this post/timeline\n\n\u201cBut tells OP hes always short on money\u201d\n\nMaybe during year 1-4 as stated by op. \n\n\u201c5th year he goes all out\u201d\n\n\u201cCoach bag, flowers, cake and everything\u201d\n\nMoney doesnt seem to be an issue.\nCoincidentally OP is \u201coverjoyed\u201d \n\n\u201crecently releases successful music video\u201d \n\nI do nice things for him to celebrate \n\n\u201cThen he does nothing for Valentine\u2019s Day\u201d\n\nHe didnt spend money on me even after i did something nice for him.  \n\nFor his birthday\u2026\n\n\u201cI buy him a $450 jacket\u201d that he wanted and \u201ca cake\u201d\n\nFor OP\u2019s birthday\u2026\n\n\u201cHe surprised me at midnight with cake & flowers\u201d\n\n\u201cnext day we did nothing until the evening i was pretty sad\u201d\n\n\u201cAt 5pm he surprised me again calling my parents and sisters for tea and he got me a second cake\u201d\n\nHow dare he bring her family unannounced to celebrate the birthday of their most precious treasured daughter and also invite her other siblings to come as well. This guy has some nerve spending all that money on other people instead of taking her on a \u201cromantic date since their wedding\u201d. I mean how appalling. \n\nHe told OP sister that her gift is on the way so OP\u2019s \u201chopes suddenly got up again and I started getting excited\u201d \n\nBecause he was spending money on me and buying me things. Doesnt mention a \u201cromantic date\u201d ever again. \nNever once states that even if he did not buy her something even if it was hand made she would like it. \n\n\u201cHe often gets the finest things for himself i feel like an afterthought\u201d \n\n\u201cHe has a designer belt he ordered for himself, I have seen him browse watches for his friends\u201d\n\nOP doesnt appreciate what he does for her and when he does something nice OP always wants more. \n\nAll i see is an unappreciative wife. I would say gold digger but i feel like thats crossing a line. \n\nI admit his gift giving skills or a lack there of leave a lot to be desired. \n$15 gift directly from supplier not wrapped. \nLying about ordering 3 times JBL headphones. \nAll really shitty on his part. \n\nBut even you have to admit that she sounds like an entitled bratty kid complaining about not getting a pony for her birthday. \n\nGiving is better than receiving. \n\nMoral of the story is\u2026\n\nDon\u2019t have EXPECTATIONS and you wont have DISAPPOINTMENTS.", "But not invite the husband."]}
