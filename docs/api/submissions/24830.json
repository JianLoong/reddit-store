I 41F have daughter \"Ceci\" (17F) with my husband \"Ray\" (41M). Ceci has a brain based disorder called misophonia that makes her very sensitive to certain sounds, in her case, people speaking, chewing, anything with their mouth pretty much and it's very severe. Ever since she was born she was prone to outbursts and meltdowns(details of which I'm not able to share here) from my voice. We thought she was likely on the spectrum for a while until a professional told us she believes she has misophonia(AFAIK it's not yet recognized as a disorder so you technically can't be diagnosed) \n\nHer anger was always instant and at it's worst whenever I made any noises so to keep it to a minimum, we formed a plan that I would not speak in her presence, ever. Instead I use ASL, texting, text to speech or Ray will be a messenger, anything but my mouth pretty much. I even have to be careful just clearing my throat or making sure she can't hear me from another room so she isn't triggered. She stopped going to public school and takes her classes online. We are also all in therapy while she is also in cognitive behavioral therapy. She has shown a lot of improvement over the years but my voice is still a huge trigger for her. She finds my voice grating and unbearable and she goes from zero to a hundred at the slightest noise I make. It's been awful for me to deal with in all honesty and while our relationship isn't terrible by any means there is always this barrier....\n\nShe'll be starting senior year soon and Ray and I decided that once she became an adult, I would not be mute anymore. I think it's been long enough now and Ceci will need to try and make do because her condition is still not recognized to a lot of people and thus the real world will not be able to be nearly as accommodating towards her condition compared to others. With a year to go we thought we'd tell her now in advance so she could prepare. She took this horribly and does not how she will function in the house as she wants to take online courses. We told her she can stay as long as she wants (rent free even) but this is the condition. She has not been talking to me since and Ray thinks we should change our minds to until she moves out or finishes college instead but I don't want to budge. I care for her comfort but I really want to have my voice in the home back. AITA.

Like, who stays mute for 6 years in their own house? How did that help her grow?

You're telling me that you haven't spoken out loud in your own home for six years because your daughter's condition makes her find your voice unbearable, and there's not even an official diagnosis for this condition? While I absolutely sympathize with unique health challenges, this entire scenario raises a sea of red flags. You've spent six years molding your life around an ailment that isn't even fully recognized medically, and now that you've set a reasonable boundary, it's become a major issue? Where's the line here? Your daughter's discomfort is valid, but it's also essential to instill resilience and adaptability for her future. The world won't always adjust for her; she'll have to find coping mechanisms, and delaying your own needs for her indefinitely is unrealistic and unfair to you. Life won't always come with trigger warnings, and while it sounds harsh, your daughter needs to learn how to navigate it. Your husband's suggestion for a prolonged time frame might be a compromise, but you have every right to feel skeptical about this whole situation.

Mine is mainly with chewing/smacking sounds and retching sounds(there are other sounds I can\u2019t tolerate like sounds at certain frequencies/volumes or paper bags being crumpled). My family makes sure to chew with their mouths closed, they don\u2019t make smacking sounds around me, and don\u2019t chew gum around me. If someone gets sick, I go in another room or put on my headphones.\n\nThe world isn\u2019t gonna make itself silent for your daughter- she\u2019s gonna have to make some adjustments.

Why can't she just wear them?", "Being mute in your own home for so long sounds terrible and surely this is not a tenable solution for your family.   NTA.\n\nI cannot believe that your voice is so unique that no one else sounds like you.  If your daughter has any plans to live a semi normal life, doesn't she need to work on coping with your voice and other similar voices she's going to come across at work, out with friends, at the shops, even on TV? From a quick Google it looks like there are some common coping strategies used by others with misophonia, ranging from noise cancelling headphones to mindfulness to tinnitus retraining therapy. I have no idea what would work for your daughter but if you all keep  going the way she seemingly wants, you'll be a silent observer to your husband and your daughter's lives to the end of your life. You mentioned that you're seeing therapist(s) but I think you need to find someone else who can help you navigate a path towards a more normal life, and one that doesn't completely mute you. \n\nIf your daughter's reaction is truly only to YOUR voice then it's not just a matter of sound: there is another issue in there, and addressing that issue would be worthwhile. Again, where is your therapist in this? Is your therapist a registered psychologist or psychiatrist, or are they just a helpful but untrained person? From what I just read, misophonia may be related to ADHD or autism, with both of which people may have sensitivity to certain sounds, light etc.  If she has something else going on, I wonder if treating it might also help reduce her sensitivity?\n\nI'm sure you've already done lots of proper research into this issue, but my brief Google search turned up 2 interesting US based organisations that I would join / get in touch with if I were you (if you haven't already):\n\nhttps://misophonia-association.org/\n\nhttps://psychiatry.duke.edu/duke-center-misophonia-and-emotion-regulation", "NTA and good to give her one year notice- I would maybe help her rent a new place - she is young - can you afford to pay for one years rent or maybe more?

Enough with the muteness. Some of the work has to go on her - at least speak when she is not in the same room - and if she is wearing noise-blocking headphones that should help - or she has to start listening to music in them. Its one thing not to talk in the same room as her but its taking it too far if she is another room or the same floor.\n\nI have misophonia, and its the most irritating thing and you fixate on sounds - for me its anyone eating, chewing, scraping cutlery on plates - but  I don't lose it at people - I play music to block it out. I have a colleague who is so noisy at chewing all day and slurping when eating - i just had to put headphones on at work and play something low to cover it so i could work. She needs to do that - the solution is not you going mute and its not acceptable she has meltdowns - she has to learn to control her response and she cant do that if you are totally mute.\n\nAlso its absurd one voice only triggers her....i think this is a mental issue she has with you now.

This is very treatable if it is in fact ocd.", "Oh so she doesn't actually have \"misophonia\", she just hates your guts. She's able to tolerate every other sound just fine, you know, for the people she actually gives a shit about. And you showed for the past six years that she can demand whatever she wants of you and you'll just give in.\nThis is completely insane, I would compare it to slavery but it's even worse. It's like, idk, something a dick emperor on a power trip would demand their court jester minion to keep himself entertained and just because he can.\nAnd it's even hard to feel bad for you because this level of doormattery is so unheard of that at this point you and everyone around you that think this is normal must just be completely batshit crazy.\nDid everyone in your family always treat you like an appliance? Did your husband always make you feel like you existed solely for the convenience of the rest of the household? Did your parents?

Are they okay with the current set up of you never speaking in front of your daughter?", "So... She needs to move out. If her trigger is one specific person, she moves away from that specific person, everybody wins.\n\nI struggle to believe that this is real tbh but on the off chance that it is, it's not a sustainable situation. You cannot live comfortably with the fear of making any sound (since it's not even just the not talking apparently).", "Noise canceling headphone or somthing that's insane", "Nailed it.", "That's a fucking horrible idea.\n\nGet your voice back. You've suffered long enough.\n\nETA: And just pointing out, OP:\n\n> AITA for **not wanting** to **stop being** mute\n\nYour post title is *100% the opposite* of what you're actually asking. Those double negatives are a bitch."]}
