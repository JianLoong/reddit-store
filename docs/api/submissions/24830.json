I 41F have daughter \"Ceci\" (17F) with my husband \"Ray\" (41M). Ceci has a brain based disorder called misophonia that makes her very sensitive to certain sounds, in her case, people speaking, chewing, anything with their mouth pretty much and it's very severe. Ever since she was born she was prone to outbursts and meltdowns(details of which I'm not able to share here) from my voice. We thought she was likely on the spectrum for a while until a professional told us she believes she has misophonia(AFAIK it's not yet recognized as a disorder so you technically can't be diagnosed) \n\nHer anger was always instant and at it's worst whenever I made any noises so to keep it to a minimum, we formed a plan that I would not speak in her presence, ever. Instead I use ASL, texting, text to speech or Ray will be a messenger, anything but my mouth pretty much. I even have to be careful just clearing my throat or making sure she can't hear me from another room so she isn't triggered. She stopped going to public school and takes her classes online. We are also all in therapy while she is also in cognitive behavioral therapy. She has shown a lot of improvement over the years but my voice is still a huge trigger for her. She finds my voice grating and unbearable and she goes from zero to a hundred at the slightest noise I make. It's been awful for me to deal with in all honesty and while our relationship isn't terrible by any means there is always this barrier....\n\nShe'll be starting senior year soon and Ray and I decided that once she became an adult, I would not be mute anymore. I think it's been long enough now and Ceci will need to try and make do because her condition is still not recognized to a lot of people and thus the real world will not be able to be nearly as accommodating towards her condition compared to others. With a year to go we thought we'd tell her now in advance so she could prepare. She took this horribly and does not how she will function in the house as she wants to take online courses. We told her she can stay as long as she wants (rent free even) but this is the condition. She has not been talking to me since and Ray thinks we should change our minds to until she moves out or finishes college instead but I don't want to budge. I care for her comfort but I really want to have my voice in the home back. AITA.

Imagine coddling your daughter so much and then being surprised that she's reacting this way when you finally try and grow a spine. My face is that Jackie Chan meme.\n\nYou've brought up an entitled young adult who'll struggle in the real world when other people don't bend to her wishes about sound. Like, who stays mute for 6 years in their own house? How did that help her grow? What happens if another voice triggers her as much as yours?\n\nIf you wanted her to be able to function as an adult you should have gotten her to work on coping mechanisms instead of taking the path of least resistance. The first time she's not catered to by a stranger will be interesting.", "INFO:  Is this avoidance of your voice the way whatever professional you saw told you to deal with this situation?  Are there alternative treatments, like exposure therapy, that could help her get to a point where your daughter would learn coping strategies that would help her to cope with stimuli that she finds difficult?", "Wow what a hard situation. Wow you have given up so much. As an adult she\u2019s going to need to learn how to cope but do you think it\u2019s a good idea to make her deal with so many stressors all at once. Your voice is a stressor she could start getting used to now. Honestly I feel she should have been learning coping skills this whole time. Pick your battles but being able to speak is a battle I\u2019d have picked much sooner. Speaking is a very basic thing.\n\nNTA", "NTA but you aren\u2019t doing her any service by hiding her triggers.

She needs to be a functioning adult someday.", "NTA.\nYou\u2019ve got above and beyond already.\nFar out, it must if been so hard for you", "NTA- redrawing a boundary with an adult child seems reasonable and shows you see her as capable. Her condition sounds awful and incredibly painful to you both and you\u2019ve done a lot of accommodating. It may backfire and push her away though. Which may be good for her independence or could have a negative impact on her mental health? Regardless I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being unreasonable given how much you have sacrificed.", "If you are her major trigger can she go live with another family member like her grandparents? It doesn't sound like she could cope with living  alone but living with you isn't sustainable either.", "This sounds like a very difficult situation with no winners, but I will say NTA. I know very little of this condition but it sounds like you made a huge sacrifice to keep your daughter comfortable growing up, but in the longterm this solution is just not reasonable. You cannot just be mute forever. It will probably be really hard for Ceci during the change but it was smart to give her a year notice so she can prepare for this big step. Hopefully as time goes by she can make use of treatments so she can live a comfortable life without expecting certain people to literally go mute.", "ESH. She's been manipulating you for six years. JFC.\n\nI hope you have the spine to follow through and begin speaking in your own home again. If Ceci doesn't like it, too bad. She will be an adult; she can fuck off.", "NTA\n\nYou've accommodated your daughter long enough. She has the capabilities to prepare herself. What's she planning on doing in the real world?", "NTA. Your daughter's condition is obviously very challenging but I can't believe that you would agree to mute yourself for so many years. You are a human being just like she is, and just because she has issues does not entitle her to psychologically imprison you this way. It honestly sounds horrifying.", "Hold on a second. You're telling me that you haven't spoken out loud in your own home for six years because your daughter's condition makes her find your voice unbearable, and there's not even an official diagnosis for this condition? While I absolutely sympathize with unique health challenges, this entire scenario raises a sea of red flags. You've spent six years molding your life around an ailment that isn't even fully recognized medically, and now that you've set a reasonable boundary, it's become a major issue? Where's the line here? Your daughter's discomfort is valid, but it's also essential to instill resilience and adaptability for her future. The world won't always adjust for her; she'll have to find coping mechanisms, and delaying your own needs for her indefinitely is unrealistic and unfair to you. Life won't always come with trigger warnings, and while it sounds harsh, your daughter needs to learn how to navigate it. Your husband's suggestion for a prolonged time frame might be a compromise, but you have every right to feel skeptical about this whole situation. NTA, but something feels really off about this story.", "NTA. She has got to learn that the world doesn't revolve around her or her condition. If she can't cope, then I suggest she move to the mountains and become a hermit.", "I have misophonia- though not as bad as her. I put on noise canceling headphones or remove myself from the situation. My family has made *reasonable* changes for me. Mine is mainly with chewing/smacking sounds and retching sounds(there are other sounds I can\u2019t tolerate like sounds at certain frequencies/volumes or paper bags being crumpled). My family makes sure to chew with their mouths closed, they don\u2019t make smacking sounds around me, and don\u2019t chew gum around me. If someone gets sick, I go in another room or put on my headphones.\n\nThe world isn\u2019t gonna make itself silent for your daughter- she\u2019s gonna have to make some adjustments. I\u2019d invest in a good set of noise cancelling headphones for her. Maybe have a meeting with her therapist to let them know changes are being made and you\u2019ll no longer be mute in your own home so they can plan some ways for her to accept and deal with this change.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And how is she demanding more of you?\n\nStop being mute. She needs to deal with it, just as she has to deal with other people's voices.
