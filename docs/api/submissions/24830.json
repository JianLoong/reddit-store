I 41F have daughter \"Ceci\" (17F) with my husband \"Ray\" (41M). Ceci has a brain based disorder called misophonia that makes her very sensitive to certain sounds, in her case, people speaking, chewing, anything with their mouth pretty much and it's very severe. Ever since she was born she was prone to outbursts and meltdowns(details of which I'm not able to share here) from my voice. We thought she was likely on the spectrum for a while until a professional told us she believes she has misophonia(AFAIK it's not yet recognized as a disorder so you technically can't be diagnosed) \n\nHer anger was always instant and at it's worst whenever I made any noises so to keep it to a minimum, we formed a plan that I would not speak in her presence, ever. Instead I use ASL, texting, text to speech or Ray will be a messenger, anything but my mouth pretty much. I even have to be careful just clearing my throat or making sure she can't hear me from another room so she isn't triggered. She stopped going to public school and takes her classes online. We are also all in therapy while she is also in cognitive behavioral therapy. She has shown a lot of improvement over the years but my voice is still a huge trigger for her. She finds my voice grating and unbearable and she goes from zero to a hundred at the slightest noise I make. It's been awful for me to deal with in all honesty and while our relationship isn't terrible by any means there is always this barrier....\n\nShe'll be starting senior year soon and Ray and I decided that once she became an adult, I would not be mute anymore. I think it's been long enough now and Ceci will need to try and make do because her condition is still not recognized to a lot of people and thus the real world will not be able to be nearly as accommodating towards her condition compared to others. With a year to go we thought we'd tell her now in advance so she could prepare. She took this horribly and does not how she will function in the house as she wants to take online courses. We told her she can stay as long as she wants (rent free even) but this is the condition. She has not been talking to me since and Ray thinks we should change our minds to until she moves out or finishes college instead but I don't want to budge.

You're telling me that you haven't spoken out loud in your own home for six years because your daughter's condition makes her find your voice unbearable, and there's not even an official diagnosis for this condition? While I absolutely sympathize with unique health challenges, this entire scenario raises a sea of red flags. You've spent six years molding your life around an ailment that isn't even fully recognized medically, and now that you've set a reasonable boundary, it's become a major issue? Where's the line here? Your daughter's discomfort is valid, but it's also essential to instill resilience and adaptability for her future. The world won't always adjust for her; she'll have to find coping mechanisms, and delaying your own needs for her indefinitely is unrealistic and unfair to you. Life won't always come with trigger warnings, and while it sounds harsh, your daughter needs to learn how to navigate it.

Mine is mainly with chewing/smacking sounds and retching sounds(there are other sounds I can\u2019t tolerate like sounds at certain frequencies/volumes or paper bags being crumpled). My family makes sure to chew with their mouths closed, they don\u2019t make smacking sounds around me, and don\u2019t chew gum around me. If someone gets sick, I go in another room or put on my headphones.\n\nThe world isn\u2019t gonna make itself silent for your daughter- she\u2019s gonna have to make some adjustments.

Why can't she just wear them?", "Being mute in your own home for so long sounds terrible and surely this is not a tenable solution for your family.   NTA.\n\nI cannot believe that your voice is so unique that no one else sounds like you.  If your daughter has any plans to live a semi normal life, doesn't she need to work on coping with your voice and other similar voices she's going to come across at work, out with friends, at the shops, even on TV? From a quick Google it looks like there are some common coping strategies used by others with misophonia, ranging from noise cancelling headphones to mindfulness to tinnitus retraining therapy. I have no idea what would work for your daughter but if you all keep  going the way she seemingly wants, you'll be a silent observer to your husband and your daughter's lives to the end of your life. You mentioned that you're seeing therapist(s) but I think you need to find someone else who can help you navigate a path towards a more normal life, and one that doesn't completely mute you. \n\nIf your daughter's reaction is truly only to YOUR voice then it's not just a matter of sound: there is another issue in there, and addressing that issue would be worthwhile. Again, where is your therapist in this? Is your therapist a registered psychologist or psychiatrist, or are they just a helpful but untrained person? From what I just read, misophonia may be related to ADHD or autism, with both of which people may have sensitivity to certain sounds, light etc.  If she has something else going on, I wonder if treating it might also help reduce her sensitivity?\n\nI'm sure you've already done lots of proper research into this issue, but my brief Google search turned up 2 interesting US based organisations that I would join / get in touch with if I were you (if you haven't already):\n\nhttps://misophonia-association.org/\n\nhttps://psychiatry.duke.edu/duke-center-misophonia-and-emotion-regulation", "NTA and good to give her one year notice- I would maybe help her rent a new place - she is young - can you afford to pay for one years rent or maybe more?

I have a colleague who is so noisy at chewing all day and slurping when eating - i just had to put headphones on at work and play something low to cover it so i could work. She needs to do that - the solution is not you going mute and its not acceptable she has meltdowns - she has to learn to control her response and she cant do that if you are totally mute.\n\nAlso its absurd one voice only triggers her....i think this is a mental issue she has with you now.

I have so many questions.\n\nINFO: is your daughter disabled in any other way? because the way you're describing this situation, as having a daughter on the cusp of 18 who has such extreme sensitivities to noises that she is schooled online and can only cope with being outside for short periods of time, and only after years of progress in therapy, indicates that she is a fairly severely disabled young woman. this is a very disabling condition that she has, and the comments here mostly seem to be missing this as a possibility. is she intellectually disabled in any other way? why is complete avoidance of such a specific trigger as your voice the only solution to her sensitivities that you have found? has medication to assist in emotional regulation been considered or tried? how did you end up here? this is so extreme. I can't imagine voluntary mutism by a caregiver being something that trained professionals would recommend to improve your daughter's quality of life. granted, I'm not one of those trained professionals, but I have a special interest in psychology (special interest in the autistic sense) and from what I know of even group homes for adult intellectually disabled people with complex and significant care needs, the focus in managing difficult conditions is put on improving quality of life by fostering resilience to unavoidable discomfort, and removing reasonably avoidable discomforts. your voice is not a reasonably avoidable discomfort for her. anyone's specific voice, especially a caregiver, can't reasonably be considered a trigger that should be avoided. it should be coped with. I can't believe this is a real situation honestly because this is such a ridiculous place to end up, and I can't imagine how parents of a child with such serious difficulties and therapists for the whole family would end up with this as their \"solution\". \n\nshe wants to be a paralegal. she wants to go to college and have a demanding career. this career choice involves working with other people. what plan has been discussed with her and her professional care team about how this career is going to be managed with her disability? and I'm considering this a disability, because I'm giving everyone in this situation the benefit of the doubt. the most realistic possibility here is of course that this is rage bait, and the second most realistic possibility is that your husband is using your daughter to abuse you (I don't believe a 12 year old can independently begin and sustain abuse on their adult caregiver without the complicity of the other adults in the home, and it sounds like your husband is complicit from how he's responded to her freakout about having to hear your voice). how are you going to go about acquiring accomodations for her in college and in the workplace? because again, giving benefit of the doubt that your daughter is trying her best but is simply unable to cope with noises to such an extent that she cannot cope with an 8 hour day in public surrounded by people, this is a seriously disabling condition and she will need to get this medically recognised properly in order to access any sort of disabled-persons-rights in the workplace, which she will need if she wants to ever have a workplace. \n\nthere is so much here that doesn't make sense to have gone so completely unaddressed in your daughter's lifetime. misophonia does not sound like an adequate diagnosis for this condition she has, because misophonia does not typically present as a serious disability on its own, with uncontrollable meltdowns even in late teenagehood. this sounds like a terrible, awful, isolating situation for everyone involved, and like you really need to step up and start looking at this situation differently, and look into help from more qualified professionals than you currently have involved here. \n\nin conclusion, assuming this is real: NTA, but what the fuck.", "Assuming this post is real,\n\nDear OP,\n\nPlease ignore the comments saying your daughter hates you it is intentionally abusing you. I sincerely doubt that\u2019s true. \n\nI can\u2019t fully empathise with what you\u2019re going through but I will say I personally have a daughter assumed on the spectrum. When she\u2019s experiencing sensory overload she will SCREAM \u201cshut up\u201d until everyone is dead silent. After she calms down and she\u2019s able to tolerate things again she will be extremely apologetic and ashamed of her actions. \n\nIf I were to explain this interaction to people who don\u2019t know her they\u2019d probably say she\u2019s just having a tantrum or manipulating and controlling me. But I know my child and that\u2019s not the case. She can\u2019t help it. (She\u2019s 8 by the way.)\n\nPeople really struggle to understand that other people can have incredibly different experiences in the world, people can\u2019t imagine that anyone *really* feels a horrifying and unbearable \u201cnails on chalkboard\u201d response to hearing someone cough. Instead they assume everyone finds coughing equally annoying and those who complain that it\u2019s unbearable are lying, manipulating, controlling, attention-seeking or whining. \n\nI briefly read about the condition and read it often initially manifests as extreme intolerance of a sound made *by a parent* so no, it\u2019s not as weird that it\u2019s just your voice as everyone here is saying. It\u2019s also not weird that she copes better when out and about than she does at home, that\u2019s normal for kids on the spectrum so it makes sense to me it\u2019s normal for your kid too.\n\nThose saying she needs \u201ccoping skills\u201d are equally uninformed. What coping skill do you develop to tolerate an unbearable sound like a screaming infant? All you can do is leave the area or use earplugs, there\u2019s no \u201ccoping skill\u201d aside from gritting your teeth and pretending it\u2019s not bothering you (aka masking) but that just helps you seem normal to get through a brief situation.\n\nYou\u2019re an amazing mother for doing everything you can for your child. It\u2019s definitely time that you regain your voice. I think you may need to try some sort of systemic desensitisation with the aid of a therapist or similar. It\u2019s probably important for your daughter to feel some kind of control in the situation, like a way to communicate how much distress she is in and when it\u2019s unbearable.\n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible from the little I know here that she could tolerate your voice in small amounts but is terrified that if you start talking and she loses control, you\u2019ll overwhelm her abs she\u2019ll melt down. \n\nAnyway I wish you well and please ignore the people discounting your experience and your daughters and suggesting this is all a ruse on her part.", "This post sounds like a made up story, but I can say from my own experience that misophonia while I was raging teen in puberty was REAL.

Spoken conversation when necessary, but no more than necessary. Any stressful information from you comes in text form.

Be direct. \n\nSeek a professional that specializes in sensory issues, exposure therapy, OCD and/or coping strategies. The field is multidisciplinary, so that person or people might be a psychologist, occupational therapist, social worker with counseling subspecialty, or behavior specialist/BCBA. \n\nConsider family and couples therapy to deal with the big feelings this change will cause. \n\nConsider medical management with a psychiatrist for emotional dysregulation and anxiety \n\nLook into some environmental adaptations to ease the transition, such as noise cancelling headphones, earplugs, sound dampening wall panels and carpeting. \n\nSet a schedule for reintroducing your voice into family life and stick to it. There will be pushback. Keep going anyway. You can set quiet hours where the expectation is nobody will talk, not just you. Or set \u201ctaking time\u201d where everyone has the right to speak in public spaces in the home. \n\nMake it crystal clear that violent tantrums will not be tolerated. This is a really tough one, but very important. Strong boundaries need to be established and maintained, even if it leads to police/mental health services being called. You and your partner need to be on the same page about this. \n\nYour daughter\u2019s needs have superseded your own for too long.

But since you have, giving your daughter a full year warning before you start speaking again so she can make an informed decision whether to remain at home or not it's a very generous accommodation.\n\nThe fact that she is triggered not only by your speaking voice but also by you clearing your throat, while being able to handle other people speaking and the chaotic sounds of a shopping mall strongly suggests to me that she's manipulating you.  I have certain frequencies and sounds that are triggering, but it's consistent to the sound, not the person.   It may be that your voice is in her triggering range, but she's also using the threats of a meltdown to control the rest of your behavior. That's not healthy for any of you.   \n\nI would suggest an individual therapist for her and a separate one for you to help you each work through the rest of what's going on here.", "I hate my mom speaking at all but even I wouldn\u2019t manipulate her into not speaking for years like holy crap. And the only reason why I hate her talking is due to the fact she doesn\u2019t speak to anyone civilly, she YELLS at people", "I know a couple of individuals who allegedly claim to have misophonia and they are by far the cringiest, most spoiled and high-maintenance people I've ever met.", "Does she realize as a paralegal she\u2019ll come across people she finds \u201cunbearable\u201d ??

You deserve to be comfortable in your own home and your daughter is old enough to use noise canceling headphones and stay in her room where she doesn't have to hear you.", "NTA. Honestly, you should have started long ago, or never stopped speaking. I\u2019m sure the meltdowns may have been bad, and it\u2019s been easier just not speaking for roughly 17 years, but at this rate, your daughter will need to either adjust, or you will never speak again. The world isn\u2019t going to bend over backwards to accommodate her, and a job will be very difficult for someone that can\u2019t stand people speaking, chewing, etc. IDK your and your husbands stance, but if you keep bending to her will, she will never leave the house, and will depend on you two for everything.", "dude i have a sensitivity especially to loud chewers (drives me into a spiral), but i think your daughter just hates you and found a way to not have to \u201clisten\u201d to you\u2026\u2026literally.

When my daughter would bring the woman to visit her parents, the father would retreat to another room and not speak to her. Honestly, I thought it was ridiculous.

We don't make other people go mute", "This is parenting with tolerance to the detriment themselves and society. I get that we cannot abuse children as form of punishment, but raising a child like this is no way a solution to such a problem. This child has been conditioned for absolute compliance by her own parents instead of providing tools and solution to deal with her condition by her own self.

There's red flags all across the field", "Okay so misophonia is a real thing, even if it's not officially diagnosable (trust me, I have it, it's awful). That said, how her mother completely catered to the daughter is in no way helpful to either of them. It's great when someone is considerate of my triggers, but it's absolutely a \"me\" problem, not anyone else's. Girl needs to get earplugs and/or noise canceling headphones and learn to leave the room if she can't handle the noises. Expecting everyone to cater to her noise needs is only gonna make things worse for the rest of her life since that's not actually feasible", "I don't think it's an American thing, I just thing it's a doormat thing. The girl is obviously manipulating her parents. She has a \"disorder\" when it comes to listening to her mom or going to school, but as soon as she wants to go shopping or hang out with friends it's all better? Yeah, she's faking it or, at the very least, using what sensory issues she does has as an excuse to avoid everything she doesn't want to do. The real diagnosis here is bullshitopathy.", "I have diagnosed misophonia and the way you've handled your daughters diagnosis is batshit insane.", "My BIL has minor misophonia related to his three kids and just wears special headphones around the house/ear plugs (that just dampen sound) when they\u2019re out and about. Curious why these have never been introduced as a coping mechanism for your daughter? As other have noted, what happens when something in the real world triggers her?

I don't understand why it's such a big deal for her to just... not tap her damn fingers! I'll be driving back to my parents place in October with them and it's a 12 hour drive, so I'll be packing my Bose noise cancelling headphones since I'm sure she'll have at least one bout of pettiness.", "Because they do fuck all to remove voice. They cancel low frequency droney sound. Voice is too high frequency to physically have time to spit out a phase cancelled sound wave into your ears. Industrial ear protectors I think would lower sound the most. That paired with ear plugs would probably silence most of it.", "Do you have a name brand or model of those muffs to recommend? I wear headphones everywhere but am probably damaging my ears, and noise cancelling doesn't block the kind of siunds I have trouble with. Ear muffs never occurred to me as an option.", "I grew up with someone with misophonia, which I didn't understand until recently. Shit fucks your kids up, and making people accommodate for you instead of dealing with your own shit is never the answer. I literally have CPTSD from the way she treated me for doing normal kid things because I had to be quieter than a mouse or I'd be punished. If I accidentally make a noise I still get flashbacks. Like I understand people with misophonia are too triggered in the moment, but when you're in a quiet place and you're calm you can develop strategies to avoid the noises and handle being triggered just like I have to do now. Because somebody else had misophonia and didn't do it.", "NTA but I feel like you shouldn\u2019t have accommodated her for so long. I say this as someone with misophonia who used to have full blown melt downs at the dinner table because I could not handle the way my family talked and chewed, often resulting in me sobbing in the bathroom until dinner was over. It is a terrible condition to have and it sucks that there aren\u2019t many resources out there to help treat it, but the solution is not to go mute for years. \n\nThere are coping mechanisms out there, but if she isn\u2019t actively seeking them out, then she\u2019ll never improved. My biggest aid is simply headphones or ear plugs. If it\u2019s a good day, I just leave them on without any music playing. It does enough to muffled the sounds of those around me while still allowing me to communicate fairly normally. If it\u2019s a bad day, I\u2019ll play music or ambient noises and turn my focus towards that when people are talking around me. Even something like a fidget toy does a great job at drawing my attention away from particular sounds. \n\nThese methods aren\u2019t foolproof and of course my family has made a few accommodations, such as allowing me to eat away from them and refusing to chew gum around me. But they have never gone as far as not speaking. That\u2019s just too much. I really don\u2019t see a good solution here as she has been catered to so heavily for the past six years. You are a very kind mother. But sometimes you have to tell your kid that what they want is simply not feasible and is negatively affecting your life. My family could not cater to all my misophonia triggers which I hated when I was younger. But I learned to adapt from that which was extremely important. Best of luck to you", "While not 100% noise cancelling, I've had good success with noise cancelling headphones on top of foam ear plugs. I've been in a good place so I haven't had to do this recently, don't even carry emergency ear plus anymore. I do have noise cancelling headphones though", "Maybe it might help you, but I've paired noise cancelling headphones with audiobooks. I have a lot of audiobooks, not every book works for me. I have enough chosen books it could take years before I need to repeat. I can focus on my favorite stories and make it past anxiety or chronic pain.", "There is no way a professional agreed to this. My kid is on the spectrum and I have to make a lot of accommodations but the whole purpose of therapy and parenting is to prepare him for the real world and give him the best possible life. She is obviously able to manage other people's voices or she wouldn't have been able to do online school.", "I have mild misophonia and vocal fry makes my brain short circuit. I hate it. I can absolutely see a particular voice being difficult to cope with, but OP is insane to just go mute over this.", "Oh, I hate the sound of gum-chewing. It's one of the worst sounds to my poor ears. Especially when people snap/pop their gum as well. So horrible!", "Or it's a power play, and has always been. I can understand being sensitive to sounds, and getting overwhelmed after prolonged socialising, but whenever mom makes any sound? Yeah no, that's on purpose.", "It\u2019s not even just her talking! It\u2019s any SOUND that she makes!", "She tolerates her fathers voice, chewing, and other noises just fine. Same with her friends. It doesn't seem like its about people being close to her since it sounds like the father is closer to the daughter than OP. It's literally only OP her daughter can't stand.", "Same here! Been with my partner for 5 years and every year i fall more in love with him and every year I also find his noises more unbearable !", "It's probably not proper misophonia, but I cannot stand the sound of my mother's chewing.

Some people have voices that makes me want to scream, I feel it inside my ears. It hurts. It drives me crazy.

On top of that, besides treatment at very specific audiology clinics, there aren\u2019t really any solid therapeutic solutions for misophonia. I have it myself and it\u2019s absolutely torture trying to get doctors to understand the condition itself, let alone finding treatment", "It very much is a real thing. Some people have messed up wiring in the brain which accidentally connects the auditory department to the emotion department. Sensory Processing Disorder is in the DSM. It\u2019s also a trait in autistic people. In this case, the trigger sounds don\u2019t cause \u201charm,\u201d but it physiologically Does hurt, and your brain activates the fight-or-flight response.

Wild.", "It's also worrying that the girl can't cope with an 8 hour school day.

The difference is I KNOW I'm being unreasonable and try and remove myself from the eating noises or otherwise distract myself.\n At the very least I apologize and warn people before hand; it's not their fault mouth noises make me angry. \nIf real, this kid hasn't had to figure out coping mechanisms, or probably even had to reflect on the fact her anger isn't justified", "My daughter has/had it but it became much less of a problem once she started watching ASMR videos on YouTube.

I started only watching the soft talking and keyboard clicking type videos that actually induce an ASMR response in me then started watching some eating and lip smacking videos in between, while I was already relaxed.

She backpedaled super hard and said something about \"i didnt necessarily mean god, she can believe in the flowers or something!\".

For me, it's small, fast repetitive sounds specifically - a ticking clock timer was the first specific sound cue I was able to identify as a trigger.  They give me a real,  measurable physiological reaction - change in blood pressure, pulse, I can feel it rising, and it activates almost a fight or flight response.
