I 41F have daughter \"Ceci\" (17F) with my husband \"Ray\" (41M). Ceci has a brain based disorder called misophonia that makes her very sensitive to certain sounds, in her case, people speaking, chewing, anything with their mouth pretty much and it's very severe. Ever since she was born she was prone to outbursts and meltdowns(details of which I'm not able to share here) from my voice. We thought she was likely on the spectrum for a while until a professional told us she believes she has misophonia(AFAIK it's not yet recognized as a disorder so you technically can't be diagnosed) \n\nHer anger was always instant and at it's worst whenever I made any noises so to keep it to a minimum, we formed a plan that I would not speak in her presence, ever. Instead I use ASL, texting, text to speech or Ray will be a messenger, anything but my mouth pretty much. I even have to be careful just clearing my throat or making sure she can't hear me from another room so she isn't triggered. She stopped going to public school and takes her classes online. We are also all in therapy while she is also in cognitive behavioral therapy. She has shown a lot of improvement over the years but my voice is still a huge trigger for her. She finds my voice grating and unbearable and she goes from zero to a hundred at the slightest noise I make. It's been awful for me to deal with in all honesty and while our relationship isn't terrible by any means there is always this barrier....\n\nShe'll be starting senior year soon and Ray and I decided that once she became an adult, I would not be mute anymore. I think it's been long enough now and Ceci will need to try and make do because her condition is still not recognized to a lot of people and thus the real world will not be able to be nearly as accommodating towards her condition compared to others. With a year to go we thought we'd tell her now in advance so she could prepare. She took this horribly and does not how she will function in the house as she wants to take online courses. We told her she can stay as long as she wants (rent free even) but this is the condition. She has not been talking to me since and Ray thinks we should change our minds to until she moves out or finishes college instead but I don't want to budge. I care for her comfort but I really want to have my voice in the home back. AITA.

You're telling me that you haven't spoken out loud in your own home for six years because your daughter's condition makes her find your voice unbearable, and there's not even an official diagnosis for this condition? While I absolutely sympathize with unique health challenges, this entire scenario raises a sea of red flags. You've spent six years molding your life around an ailment that isn't even fully recognized medically, and now that you've set a reasonable boundary, it's become a major issue? Where's the line here? Your daughter's discomfort is valid, but it's also essential to instill resilience and adaptability for her future. The world won't always adjust for her; she'll have to find coping mechanisms, and delaying your own needs for her indefinitely is unrealistic and unfair to you. Life won't always come with trigger warnings, and while it sounds harsh, your daughter needs to learn how to navigate it. Your husband's suggestion for a prolonged time frame might be a compromise, but you have every right to feel skeptical about this whole situation.

Mine is mainly with chewing/smacking sounds and retching sounds(there are other sounds I can\u2019t tolerate like sounds at certain frequencies/volumes or paper bags being crumpled). My family makes sure to chew with their mouths closed, they don\u2019t make smacking sounds around me, and don\u2019t chew gum around me. If someone gets sick, I go in another room or put on my headphones.\n\nThe world isn\u2019t gonna make itself silent for your daughter- she\u2019s gonna have to make some adjustments.

Why can't she just wear them?", "Being mute in your own home for so long sounds terrible and surely this is not a tenable solution for your family.   NTA.\n\nI cannot believe that your voice is so unique that no one else sounds like you.  If your daughter has any plans to live a semi normal life, doesn't she need to work on coping with your voice and other similar voices she's going to come across at work, out with friends, at the shops, even on TV? From a quick Google it looks like there are some common coping strategies used by others with misophonia, ranging from noise cancelling headphones to mindfulness to tinnitus retraining therapy. I have no idea what would work for your daughter but if you all keep  going the way she seemingly wants, you'll be a silent observer to your husband and your daughter's lives to the end of your life. You mentioned that you're seeing therapist(s) but I think you need to find someone else who can help you navigate a path towards a more normal life, and one that doesn't completely mute you. \n\nIf your daughter's reaction is truly only to YOUR voice then it's not just a matter of sound: there is another issue in there, and addressing that issue would be worthwhile. Again, where is your therapist in this? Is your therapist a registered psychologist or psychiatrist, or are they just a helpful but untrained person? From what I just read, misophonia may be related to ADHD or autism, with both of which people may have sensitivity to certain sounds, light etc.  If she has something else going on, I wonder if treating it might also help reduce her sensitivity?\n\nI'm sure you've already done lots of proper research into this issue, but my brief Google search turned up 2 interesting US based organisations that I would join / get in touch with if I were you (if you haven't already):\n\nhttps://misophonia-association.org/\n\nhttps://psychiatry.duke.edu/duke-center-misophonia-and-emotion-regulation", "NTA and good to give her one year notice- I would maybe help her rent a new place - she is young - can you afford to pay for one years rent or maybe more?

I have a colleague who is so noisy at chewing all day and slurping when eating - i just had to put headphones on at work and play something low to cover it so i could work. She needs to do that - the solution is not you going mute and its not acceptable she has meltdowns - she has to learn to control her response and she cant do that if you are totally mute.\n\nAlso its absurd one voice only triggers her....i think this is a mental issue she has with you now.

I have so many questions.\n\nINFO: is your daughter disabled in any other way? because the way you're describing this situation, as having a daughter on the cusp of 18 who has such extreme sensitivities to noises that she is schooled online and can only cope with being outside for short periods of time, and only after years of progress in therapy, indicates that she is a fairly severely disabled young woman. this is a very disabling condition that she has, and the comments here mostly seem to be missing this as a possibility. is she intellectually disabled in any other way? why is complete avoidance of such a specific trigger as your voice the only solution to her sensitivities that you have found? has medication to assist in emotional regulation been considered or tried? how did you end up here? this is so extreme. I can't imagine voluntary mutism by a caregiver being something that trained professionals would recommend to improve your daughter's quality of life. granted, I'm not one of those trained professionals, but I have a special interest in psychology (special interest in the autistic sense) and from what I know of even group homes for adult intellectually disabled people with complex and significant care needs, the focus in managing difficult conditions is put on improving quality of life by fostering resilience to unavoidable discomfort, and removing reasonably avoidable discomforts. your voice is not a reasonably avoidable discomfort for her. anyone's specific voice, especially a caregiver, can't reasonably be considered a trigger that should be avoided. it should be coped with. I can't believe this is a real situation honestly because this is such a ridiculous place to end up, and I can't imagine how parents of a child with such serious difficulties and therapists for the whole family would end up with this as their \"solution\". \n\nshe wants to be a paralegal. she wants to go to college and have a demanding career. this career choice involves working with other people. what plan has been discussed with her and her professional care team about how this career is going to be managed with her disability? and I'm considering this a disability, because I'm giving everyone in this situation the benefit of the doubt. the most realistic possibility here is of course that this is rage bait, and the second most realistic possibility is that your husband is using your daughter to abuse you (I don't believe a 12 year old can independently begin and sustain abuse on their adult caregiver without the complicity of the other adults in the home, and it sounds like your husband is complicit from how he's responded to her freakout about having to hear your voice). how are you going to go about acquiring accomodations for her in college and in the workplace? because again, giving benefit of the doubt that your daughter is trying her best but is simply unable to cope with noises to such an extent that she cannot cope with an 8 hour day in public surrounded by people, this is a seriously disabling condition and she will need to get this medically recognised properly in order to access any sort of disabled-persons-rights in the workplace, which she will need if she wants to ever have a workplace. \n\nthere is so much here that doesn't make sense to have gone so completely unaddressed in your daughter's lifetime. misophonia does not sound like an adequate diagnosis for this condition she has, because misophonia does not typically present as a serious disability on its own, with uncontrollable meltdowns even in late teenagehood. this sounds like a terrible, awful, isolating situation for everyone involved, and like you really need to step up and start looking at this situation differently, and look into help from more qualified professionals than you currently have involved here. \n\nin conclusion, assuming this is real: NTA, but what the fuck.", "Assuming this post is real,\n\nDear OP,\n\nPlease ignore the comments saying your daughter hates you it is intentionally abusing you. I sincerely doubt that\u2019s true. \n\nI can\u2019t fully empathise with what you\u2019re going through but I will say I personally have a daughter assumed on the spectrum. When she\u2019s experiencing sensory overload she will SCREAM \u201cshut up\u201d until everyone is dead silent. After she calms down and she\u2019s able to tolerate things again she will be extremely apologetic and ashamed of her actions. \n\nIf I were to explain this interaction to people who don\u2019t know her they\u2019d probably say she\u2019s just having a tantrum or manipulating and controlling me. But I know my child and that\u2019s not the case. She can\u2019t help it. (She\u2019s 8 by the way.)\n\nPeople really struggle to understand that other people can have incredibly different experiences in the world, people can\u2019t imagine that anyone *really* feels a horrifying and unbearable \u201cnails on chalkboard\u201d response to hearing someone cough. Instead they assume everyone finds coughing equally annoying and those who complain that it\u2019s unbearable are lying, manipulating, controlling, attention-seeking or whining. \n\nI briefly read about the condition and read it often initially manifests as extreme intolerance of a sound made *by a parent* so no, it\u2019s not as weird that it\u2019s just your voice as everyone here is saying. It\u2019s also not weird that she copes better when out and about than she does at home, that\u2019s normal for kids on the spectrum so it makes sense to me it\u2019s normal for your kid too.\n\nThose saying she needs \u201ccoping skills\u201d are equally uninformed. What coping skill do you develop to tolerate an unbearable sound like a screaming infant? All you can do is leave the area or use earplugs, there\u2019s no \u201ccoping skill\u201d aside from gritting your teeth and pretending it\u2019s not bothering you (aka masking) but that just helps you seem normal to get through a brief situation.\n\nYou\u2019re an amazing mother for doing everything you can for your child. It\u2019s definitely time that you regain your voice. I think you may need to try some sort of systemic desensitisation with the aid of a therapist or similar. It\u2019s probably important for your daughter to feel some kind of control in the situation, like a way to communicate how much distress she is in and when it\u2019s unbearable.\n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible from the little I know here that she could tolerate your voice in small amounts but is terrified that if you start talking and she loses control, you\u2019ll overwhelm her abs she\u2019ll melt down. \n\nAnyway I wish you well and please ignore the people discounting your experience and your daughters and suggesting this is all a ruse on her part.", "This post sounds like a made up story, but I can say from my own experience that misophonia while I was raging teen in puberty was REAL.

And you showed for the past six years that she can demand whatever she wants of you and you'll just give in\n\n~~~~", "lmao that's exactly what i was thinking \ud83d\ude02", "Where's the child abuse??", "Sounds more like adult abuse", "No, but there\u2019s something funny in this exact type of parent abuse", "Exactly what i thought. It couldnt possible be that only OPs voice triggers her and No one elses", "I have to agree with this. I have misophonia and my reaction is the same for anyone who is doing what triggers it. My mom, friend, strangers etc. Also, I do not expect anyone to manage it for me. Yes being sent into that unexplainable rage is horribly uncomfortable but I know it's my responsibility and mine alone.\nI also wonder if the daughter has ODD but I'm not a professional by any means.", "That\u2019s the bit that gets me! I\u2019m confused about why OP couldn\u2019t have voice coaching or something to alter the tone/pitch of her voice rather than her daughter insisting OP never, ever speak in her presence\u2026 it just sounds really extreme. Obviously plenty of people get through life using sign language, & I wish everyone was taught sign language in school, but it sounds like it\u2019s not just words are the issue, OP can\u2019t make **any** noise. I can\u2019t even imagine the strain that must\u2019ve had on her mental health.\n\nI\u2019m glad you have some meds that kinda help! It must be difficult to live with.", "Sniffing is literally the worst, cold season on public transport is intolerable without loud music and noise cancelling headphones!", "Yeah but that was a \"teacher\" not your parent who spends full time with you. The daughter shouldve tried getting used to it. In 6 years she couldve done so much", "I find it hard to believe that she has improved so much that she can go to a noisy shopping center with friends or a noisy family event with everyone talking but can't stand the sound of your voice (even just clearing your throat) to the point where she has literally denied you a voice in your own home for the last 6 years. How is that ok to you. This does not sound like misophonia is the only potential diagnosis (giving the benefit of the doubt here that she does have it at all), and I think she has a problem with you in general. \n\nThe fact that your husband wants this to continue indefinitely (essentially until your daughter decides you're allowed to talk) is worrisome, too. There has to be some compromise here. You need to be allowed a voice in your own home.", "She will not be able to function in the adult world. If she\u2019s crying, yelling, etc., at the sound of someone  making any kind of noise, she can not be a functional member of society. She\u2019s almost an adult, stop letting her be in control of the house, and *be a responsible parent*, teach her how to cope with things she doesn\u2019t like rather than expecting everyone to bend to her will.", "Pahahahaha!", "Right, let me explain.\nWhat I meant is a slave at least usually has the basic dignity of being able to speak, at least when spoken to, and stuff like that.\nI'm assuming OP does the expected share of domestic labor, maybe more, for her family and child, and is clearly not getting any affection or respect at all, so nothing, in return.\nAnd on top of that she's expected to be mute like she's some jester minion at the beck and call of a tirant, showing up to do her duty when it's convenient and not even getting to speak or exercising her basic body functions like scratching her throat, least it displeases the precious princess.\nSo yeah \"worse than slavery\" was a poor choice of words to express that.", " I\u2019m a lawyer and our paralegal is the one person every single lawyer in our group talks to every single day", "Thanks for the insider knowledge, always thought they would be like the lawyers right hand in court", "It depends on the area of law and their responsibilities.   As a Paralegal I've had to talk with our attorneys and the attorneys of the parties we are dealing with a fair amount.  Paralegal don't handle court duty but may end up handling a lot more interactions within the department or law office", "There is a HUGE difference beteween having found the niche you like after 20 years in the business and starting out.", "No - becuase THEy are the adults, and THEY made the decissions.", "Yes, but we are not supposed to mention it.", "I think that was their point, that no doctor would ever recommend this. It's a choice OP made that no one would recommend.", "100% agree. I have it pretty acutely for open mouth chewing. My mom chews with her mouth open sometimes and it\u2019s hard for me to deal with, but I still have dinner with my mother with a smile on my face because I\u2019m not a monster.", "I live in one of the cities with the worst allergy season in the entire world so back when I rode the bus I am pretty sure I would have murdered someone or maybe just imploded without my beloved Sennheisers \ud83e\udd23 When it's strangers especially it always feels like they're doing it *AT* me even though I fully recognize that's insane \ud83d\udc80", "Ooooooh Myyyyyyyy Goooooooood!!!!!!!!", "Right. It's not a \"low-interaction\" job lolol.", "I\u2019m sure some are, but the vast majority of roles are the all-important behind the scenes stuff!", "True - but behind the scenes roles aren\u2019t a niche, they\u2019re the majority. Anyways, I\u2019m not trying to litigate OP\u2019s daughter\u2019s chances in the job market.

I agree, though for me its my loved ones who I feel are deliberately attacking me with the sniffs!!!", "IF she makes it throught he training years.", "I think your understanding is lacking.
