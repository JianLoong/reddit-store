My wife gave birth to our daughter 8.5 weeks ago. She doesn't go anywhere usually because she doesn't want to get the baby sick. So she's been to her mom's twice I believe and then 3 times to doctors appointments but outside of that she's been home full time. The only person who comes to our home to visit is my mother (my MIL doesn't have a working vehicle currently and my wife's one good friend- her cousin- doesn't have her license because shes afraid of driving). Typically my mom comes here a few times a week since my wife had the baby. Prior to that we only saw my mother maybe once a month.\n\nWell, on Saturday my wife said \"I want to go see Hannah\" in passing. Hannah is her cousin. I didn't really think anything of it because it wasn't a question and she wasn't asking me to drive her anywhere at that time (she isn't driving currently because of the C-section still causing some discomfort so I drive her everywhere). My mom called maybe like 15 minutes later and said \"I'm on my way to your place\". She typically doesn't ask and just tells me she's on her way but it's usually not an issue. So I just said \"alright, see you when you get here\". Well, my wife overheard and she's like \"who did you just invite here?\" So I told her my mom was on her way and she says \"are you fucking serious? I say I want to go to Hannah's and you invite your mom here? She's been here 4 times this week already. I'm so fucking tired of seeing her darken the doorway.\" This is the first time she said anything about not wanting my mom here so I was taken back and said \"you can go to Hannah's when my mom leaves. My mom is allowed to come here to see the baby.\" Well, my wife wasn't having that at all. She took the baby and went to the bedroom and by the time my mom got here, both her and the baby had fallen asleep and they didn't wake up until like 4 hours later. When she did get up she said she is sick and tired of my mom being here and that me prioritizing my mom wanting to come here over her wanting to get out of the house for once and go to Hannah's really \"sickened\" her and she's feeling repulsed by me and my actions. She said she's unable to look at me the same after that.", "created_utc": 1700149257, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17wpw34/aita_for_inviting_my_mom_here_right_after_my_wife/", "score": 737, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My wife went through something similar after our first was born -- didn't want to go anywhere, spent a lot of time with her mom, etc. And I think there's a good chance that you're compensating for this by allowing your mom to come over uninvited and whenever she wants. \n\n1) You need to set some boundaries. **Your mom is not \"allowed to come see the baby\"**  unless you invite her to do so. She shouldn't be coming to your place on a moment's notice -- ever -- without you inviting her. It's your house with your wife, not your mom's house. You can do this nicely: just tell your mom that you and your wife need some control over your life right now, given how chaotic everything is as a (first-time?) parent, and thank her in advance for understanding.\n\n2) Consider looking up ways to ask your wife about her emotional state without it seeming like you're blaming her. This is REALLY HARD so get advice from someone who has been through it before. (I can't remember how I handled it, sorry!) Maybe talk to her mom about it. The signs are there: won't go anywhere, unhappy for no obvious reason, etc.\n\n3) All of your actions should be seen through the prism of \"are you being kind to your wife right now?\" A few weeks ago, she was uncomfortable but free from a lot of obligations. Now, she (a) has a baby, (b) is overwhelmed by the change if not depressed, and (c) recovering from surgery.

She doesn't go anywhere usually because she doesn't want to get the baby sick. So she's been to her mom's twice I believe and then 3 times to doctors appointments but outside of that she's been home full time. The only person who comes to our home to visit is my mother (my MIL doesn't have a working vehicle currently and my wife's one good friend- her cousin- doesn't have her license because shes afraid of driving). Typically my mom comes here a few times a week since my wife had the baby. Prior to that we only saw my mother maybe once a month.\n\nWell, on Saturday my wife said \"I want to go see Hannah\" in passing. Hannah is her cousin. I didn't really think anything of it because it wasn't a question and she wasn't asking me to drive her anywhere at that time (she isn't driving currently because of the C-section still causing some discomfort so I drive her everywhere). My mom called maybe like 15 minutes later and said \"I'm on my way to your place\". She typically doesn't ask and just tells me she's on her way but it's usually not an issue. So I just said \"alright, see you when you get here\". Well, my wife overheard and she's like \"who did you just invite her?\" So I told her my mom was on her way and she says \"are you fucking serious? I say I want to go to Hannah's and you invite your mom here? She's been here 4 times this week already. I'm so fucking tired of seeing her darken the doorway.\" This is the first time she said anything about not wanting my mom here so I was taken back and said \"you can go to Hannah's when my mom leaves. My mom is allowed to come here to see the baby.\" Well, my wife wasn't having that at all. She took the baby and went to the bedroom and by the time my mom got here, both her and the baby had fallen asleep and they didn't wake up until like 4 hours later. When she did get up she said she is sick and tired of my mom being here and that me prioritizing my mom wanting to come here over her wanting to get out of the house for once and go to Hannah's really \"sickened\" her and she's feeling repulsed by me and my actions. She said she's unable to look at me the same after that.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That is too much. I didn\u2019t even see MY OWN parents 4x a week when my kids were infants, let alone my in laws. No new mom wants people all up in their space when they\u2019re trying to heal up from birth. It takes A YEAR for a woman\u2019s body to fully recover from pregnancy and birth. 6+ months for hormones to get completely back to normal. You need to prioritize your wife and her comfort, not your mom and her feelings..and I say that as a mom of ALL boys. One day my kids are going to leave the nest and have families of their own and I am teaching them now that when you get married and choose a partner, they are your priority first. I had a horrible MIL who made my life hell. She taught me EXACTLY who I didn\u2019t want to be as a MIL. Sit down, talk to your wife. Ask her how she\u2019s feeling. Your Mom, whether YOU think so or not, is being too much, and your wife is telling you what she NEEDS right now. She\u2019s telling you that you are damaging your marriage and you\u2019re more concerned over \u201cit\u2019s my house too and I don\u2019t need permission\u201d? If you were my husband, you would be sleeping at your moms until you got your priorities in line. My husband added- You are a Dad now, you are your wife and child\u2019s protector and you\u2019re not doing a very good job of it. You need to get yourself right and be the husband and dad that your wife and baby deserve. If that was your daughter telling you these things and she was upset like that, how would that make you feel?", "Dude, it's not even about asking permission. Pretty much every couple I know that live together will check with their partner before inviting someone over. It seems like you're clearly allowed to have your mother over since she's at your house constantly. It's not a matter of permission, it's a matter of care and courtesy for your partner.\n\nMy husband knows I love his sister who lives near us, he still checks in when she's coming to make sure we don't have scheduling issues or that I'm mentally up for guests.\n\nYour wife recently went through a massive medical event and now has an infant to look after. Post partum is an insanely difficult time for anyone. And she's been basically trapped in the house for weeks without access to her friends or family, but too much access to your mother.\n\nTell your mom to maybe space out her visits a bit more and see what you can do to facilitate your wife seeing the people that bring her comfort. Offer to go pick up her mother or cousin or drive her to them.", "> I don't feel like I should be required to ask permission for my mom to come here honestly.\n\nYes both parties need to agree on people coming over.  \n\nPlus you told your wife to stay for your mother.  Yes you need your wife's agreement then because you're signing her up for this.\n\n> She's never communicated not wanting my mom here before.\n\nNo sane person would miss how your mother being over without asking is an issue.  Damn man.  You need to learn to cut the umbilical cord.", "You don\u2019t have to ask permission for your mother to come over 5 times in a week, but the first time your wife mentions wanting to go somewhere that isn\u2019t her mother\u2019s house or a doctor, you don\u2019t bother to ask about that either. You just assume your wife didn\u2019t mean what she said, you just assume that she wants to see your mother more than she probably sees even you, and you just assume that because you live there you can decide what baby and wife are allowed to do. \n\nDude, your wife\u2019s right. You didn\u2019t listen to her because she didn\u2019t word it right. \n\nIn your own post you said your wife didn\u2019t ask you to take her to Hannah\u2019s, she told you. You decided that means she didn\u2019t really want that. \n\nIn your own post you said your mother didn\u2019t ask you to show up, she told you.

You\u2019re not, and you\u2019re pretty bad at it. Talk to your wife and apologize. Offer to take her to Hannah\u2019s. Ask her how often is fair for your mother to come over (seriously, five times in one week is massively excessive. She\u2019s seeing your mother as often as she would a coworker/boss at a *full time job*, and she has to feel like she\u2019s entertaining at the same time; that\u2019s not ok). \n\nTell mom no. Uninvited popping over in a married persons home is absolutely *not ok*. Five minute warning calls are not appropriate communications and request for visiting. \n\nYour mom was ok not dropping by except once a month for the majority of your relationship.

Meanwhile, she has seen your mother *at least* 30 times. In 8.5 weeks, she has spent more than an *entire month* with your mother. \n\nBefore you say she didn\u2019t say anything before so you had no way to know, please do the math. \n\n- We are talking about approximately 76 days since the baby has been born. \n- she has left the house 5x since the birth. Your wife has been out of the house for 6% of your child\u2019s entire life. \n- she has spent 2% of your child\u2019s life visiting with her mother. \n- assuming your mother *only* has \u201cdarkened your doorway\u201d 30x since the birth of your baby, your wife has spent nearly ***40%*** of the life of your child stuck in the house with your mother who doesn\u2019t even think to call ahead and ask. \n- you admit that you don\u2019t think your mother needs to ask, which means your wife has not been asked at any point, just informed. So your mother has stated and gotten what she wanted 40% of the time. \n- your wife stated that she wanted to do one thing in 8.5 weeks. That means that she has stated (not asked) for what she wanted to do 1.3% of the life of your child. \n- mom got her way, wife didn\u2019t. Wife was able to say what she wanted and have it done by you exactly 0% of your child\u2019s life. \n\nLooking at it that way, I truly hope that you can see why YTA for this one.", "You're being intentionally obtuse.

Why did you get married when you\u2019re still attached at the cord?", "Most people don't want their in-laws dropping by whenever they want. Personally I don't have an open door policy for my own family either. It's basic courtesy when you share a home to check before inviting people over. Every time, without fail. The only people who ignore this and claim it's their \"right\" are huge AHs.", "And it's HER home. Her home where she is recovering from nine months of growing a whole human being and major surgery and the exhaustion of caring for a newborn after all that.\n\nShe shouldn't HAVE to ask that you consult her before inviting guests over. Guests, like children and pets, are things you ASK your partner about and BOTH of you decide. ESPECIALLY after childbirth.", "Are you freakin' serious?  I hope you do better on your second wife\n\nIn the words of bugs bunny, what a maroon.", "Yes, she should fucking ask permission. It isn\u2019t her home and it isn\u2019t her child.\n\nPretty soon you will be sharing your every other weekend with your mom and your (ex) wife won\u2019t have to deal with her at all.", "You\u2019re an AH.", "Do you want an ex-wife? Because this is how you get an ex-wife.", "You sir, are a dumbass", "Which why YTA. Your helicopter mom gets on her nerves & wife was trying to tolerate it but she was pushed too far so she boiled over. You don\u2019t seem to care about wife\u2019s feelings at all and come across as uncaring for her needs, only mommy\u2019s. Get off her teat, boy-you\u2019re not being a man that protects his immediate family. Your mom is now extended family to your nuclear family.", "How did you expect her to get to her cousin's with your baby in tow?  You said she still can't drive so you've been driving her everywhere. Therefore when she says she wants to visit her cousin, THAT'S HER SAYING SHE NEEDS YOU TO DRIVE HER THERE!!! Your issue seems to be that your wife doesn't realize how incredibly, incredibly, clueless you are. Poor thing seems to have no idea how unintelligent her husband really is.", "Does your mom know you're cheating on her with your wife?", "YTA.\n\nYou just let your mom show up whenever the hell she wants? Nah. Especially not with your wife only 8.5 weeks PP. She is still healing from major surgery. Her hormones are out of control. Her boobs are leaking. She's not getting sleep. *HER* comfort is paramount right now.", "It's not a hint of she physically can't drive and is relying on him, though? It may be unstated, but the fact of the matter is that he will be driving her. \n\nCould she have been more clear about *when* she wanted to go? Yes. But she shouldn't have to point out the obvious part that he's going to have to drive her.", "I'm not talking about the mother-in-law part. She's definitely upset for good reason!\n\nBut the rest of it? Not leaving the house is a HUGE warning sign for depression, and I think the husband needs to be there to help wherever he can.", "Glad you're getting help! Please be kind with your husband, though -- this is likely hellish for him, too!", "Oh boo hoo she's always the victim. She's still TA", "Dey play my fans. You go cry tire", "I took the comment you're replying to mean \"why didn't he prioritize his wife and take her and kiddo to her cousin's joint, or just her if she needed some space from the baby, and hang with his mom by himself until Hannah is ready to come back?\" \n\nWife has plans. She can't drive. Get off your ass. Especially since he admits that his wife has gone nowhere in almost 3 months. She's his prisoner if he plays it like that and that's bullshit.", "Yes, he is, but the wife must take some blame herself - or at least learn - that if she wants to go somewhere, she tells her husband, as long as she don\u2019t drive. She must be clear. Also, if she don\u2019t want mil visiting so much, it\u2019s plain stupid not to tell her husband. \n\nShe also could have told husband, \u2018no, I don\u2019t want to wait til after mil leaves, I want to visit Hannah now\u2019. She has words and need to use them.", "4 times a week is A LOT!", "\"you can go to Hannah's when my mom leaves. My mom is allowed to come here to see the baby.\"\n\nWas the plan OP proposed.  OP made the plan for his wife without his wife's agreement.", "I still cringe.", "Love your username! BAM!!", "yeah it's not like OP just had a baby or anything to warrant multiple visits...\n\noh wait", "Or \"my wife didn't make a big deal of it, even if my mom dropping by with little notice bugged her, because it was once a month, but now it's really getting on her nerves because it's constant and she's trying to heal, and parent, and get through the first miserable months of being a new parent without losing her sh\\*t on me constantly, and I'm completely oblivious to how obviously irritated my wife is that my mom is in her space all the time.\"", "In fairness, it's entirely possible that one day out of every 30 didn't strike OP's wife as unbearable, whereas 3-4 days out of every 7 does (with or without the added stress of trying to recover from childbirth).", "Didn't listen, or didn't care.\n\n  \nAnd why not the easiest thing to do: Sure, Mom, if I'm not back from driving wife and baby to cousin's, just wait and we can visit when I return.\"", "It sounds like he\u2019s been running down his wife\u2019s self-esteem and making sure that she\u2019s a bit hesitant to ask him to drive her somewhere- as if he\u2019s sighing and acting like driving the woman who just made and delivered his baby is a burden or a hassle. He just sounds so dismissive of his wife. What a boor and an asshole- with a rude and poorly-behaved, pushy mother, to boot.", "Same. I\u2019m a total mama\u2019s girl, but still have the boundary that she has to ASK at least an hour ahead of time if she can stop by, especially if my partner is also home. That\u2019s just basic respect, something that OP is obviously lacking.", "One time, my mom dropped me off from church, and my husband was dancing naked in the living room. She never even considers dropping by anymore. I love my husband so much \ud83d\udc93", "Like, my mum will often message me that she's going to drop by in the afternoon or something but I live alone, so there's not a partner she'd be annoying, and she gives enough time for me to be like \"Nah, can't do today\" or whatever. If I'd just had surgery and she wasn't even my mother but my husband's mother? I'd be really annoyed. Like, OP should have had this conversation with his mother way before a baby was here, but now that a baby is here, and his wife is recovering from major surgery, in what world is a heads up that you're already on your way (when you've already visited multiple times that week!) an appropriate way to say you're coming over?", "I was thinking the wife doesn\u2019t have the time if MIL is over so much. When is she supposed to have time for herself, bonding with baby, let alone other people?", "And she can't drive yet post c section....", "I wish I could give you a reward!", "She said that she wanted to go there- not that she was still deciding whether or not she wanted to go there, which was his bullshit copout. She stated what she wanted. He\u2019s the only driver now. She was pretty clear.", "It's like he doesn't realize that getting a human cut out of her and the fact that she still can't drive that she's okay with everything, despite having her activities limited.", "He also just says that they saw each other once a month. Not that his mom invited herself over while already driving and she always intruded in their home. She may have only been in their home a few times a year prior to this, and judging by her inviting herself and having raised a really inconsiderate peach like OP/the fact that they bully her together, I doubt I would want her in my home at all. Twice a year, max, in my home if you\u2019re unpleasant but related. I would want to see her in public or on her turf so I could leave at a moments notice.", "Yes- his mom is a total asshole and she has awful manners. Also, she raised this asshole. I wouldn\u2019t want this pushy, inconsiderate, bullying woman or her son in my home at all, much less several times a week. That would totally destroy my leave of mind. I wish OP\u2019s wife had married into a better, more thoughtful and decent family.", "There is almost no greater \u201cpassion killer\u201d than a husband who is too enmeshed with his mommy to actually see the effect it has on his wife (oops, I mean side chick/S).", "Absolutly! My daughter, now 36 years old was a cesarean birth too. My husband came up with reasons to leave me alone with the baby multiple times a day during the 2 weeks he took off work supposedly to help me. \nI remember every time like it was yesterday.", ">Does your mom control your life?\n\nYou know she does...", "He will let his mom answer you.", "I'm best friends with both halves of a couple and when I ask one if I can come over they still check with the other... OP is wack", "It sounds like his mom has gotten what she wants 100% of the time- she just only happened to want to come over and burden OP\u2019s wife 40% of the time. It doesn\u2019t sound like he ever says no to mommy dearest, but has no problem making choices for her wife without asking, belittling her, and allowing his mom to treat her and the baby like curiosities/baby goats at a zoo. Who wants some person in their house that often? Who likes a man who just rolls over for his mom and bosses his wife around?", "8.5 WEEKS ago, not months. Makes it even worse.", "I bet OP doesn\u2019t have enough awareness to answer that properly, probably he thinks that anything his mom does wrong is \u201cjust the way she is\u201d and any time his wife doesn\u2019t like something she just needs to \u201cstop rocking the boat\u201d and suck it up.  \n\nEven if his mom is the sweetest, most helpful, considerate person in the world and his wife has an amazing relationship with her, I cannot imagine she would want a 4x week visitor throughout the whole fourth trimester.", "Not pushed \u2014 had *major abdominal surgery* to get the baby here. Cut through 8 (I think it's 8) layers. Smelled her own skin burning. Felt the doctors tugging at her insides.\n\nI've pushed a kid out. I wouldn't trade places with OPs wife for *anything*. No thank you. (Side note: I know all births can be traumatic, but to me personally a C-section sounds particularly horrible).", "Well then maybe she shouldn\u2019t have married an idiot? \n\nObviously more than a hint is needed if just saying \u201cI think I wanna go somewhere\u201d isn\u2019t going to get her where she wants to go. If she wanted to go on this day then more is needed to be said, an actual plan in place.\n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s cool that the MIL just shows up, cause that idea just pisses me off. But if she\u2019s 100% reliant on him (which other than some discomfort is not a reason alone to rely on an idiot) to take her places then she needs to have her plans made up, not just hint that she wants him to take her to that place. Saying \u201cI wanna go see person\u201d is a hint. \u201cI wanna see this person today\u201d is telling it straight to the person you are choosing to rely on cause then more can be planned out like a time on when to leave.", "Or she has just had a c section, which means her body is recovering.", "That's because her c-section wound hurts too much to drive herself, her body is recovering from the trauma of birth, babies' immune systems are very fragile, and her husband, AKA her only mode of transport, is obviously not listening to any of her wants! Yes look out for potential PPD but that doesn't seem to be the most likely or most important problem going on right now.", "Lmfao.", "Yes, probably this. But I do wonder if the recovery to drive a car is this long, if it\u2019s physical or if it\u2019s more a mental thing not driving? I know plenty of new moms being overly cautious for both reasonable and not reasonable things. And the only thing they achieve is making their own life more difficult. Partly speaking from my own experience, but never had a c-section. \n\nWife seems to not take very much control of her own life if she doesn\u2019t say anything about mil, and doesn\u2019t do much beside staying home.", "What a logical response.", "I got ya!  But he already told his wife that she could wait until After the MIL completed her visit, didn\u2019t he?  I\u2019m too lazy to go back and read it again \ud83d\ude00. He was taken care of his mother\u2019s wishes first. Wife can just wait as far as he was concerned. And either way that\u2019s bullshit!", "OP doesn't dispute that he understood what she meant. She's not at fault just because she didn't say \"Please drive me to Hannah's\" instead of \"I want to visit Hannah.\" Stop reaching for excuses for him. \n\nAnd she did tell him she doesn't want MIL visiting so much. He immediately dismissed her feelings with all his \"it's my house too\" BS.", "If my MIL had lived close enough to 'pop over' 4 times a week I think I would have been divorced a lot sooner.", "NOTHING warrants multiple visits without prior knowledge and consent. \n\nEspecially from the person who just popped out that child, and who had major surgery. Sorry but OPs feelings do not trump his wife\u2019s feelings when it comes to this situation.", "Especially because she just had the baby the multiple visits are not just obnoxious, but actually harmful in multiple ways for the new family. Mom and baby come first for the first months, not grandma, not even the dad to the same extent as mom and baby do.", "I don\u2019t have to ask; I\u2019m me!!! \n\nHe\u2019s a baby and an idiot.", "Yep. Over seven years ago my husband picked a fight with me over not getting any sex... when I was 5 weeks postpartum. I have never forgotten what he said and how it felt.", "She apparently turned up at their house 5 times in one week, and he doesn't seem to see a problem with this. She surely controls his life.", "Thanks I did read that but typed wrong.", "Dey play", "Not giving excuses, he\u2019s one dense piece of man. But with that man, wife needs to be clearer. She must take some blame, and definitely learn from this.\n\nEdited to add: and didn\u2019t she say the thing about mil visiting, after this incident? Or did she mention this before? You", "4 times a year is a lot for me \ud83d\ude06", "How much clearer did she need to be? She can't drive right now. He knows that if she wants to go somewhere that isn't within short walking distance, he has to drive her. He says she's been spending too much time at home and is rarely in the mood to visit anyone. These are all facts he admits to knowing.\n\nShe then communicates that she wants to visit her cousin. That implies, given the facts above, that she wanted to visit her cousin that afternoon, and needed him to drive her in order to do so. 15 minutes later he's telling his mom, who had just *invited herself* to the house for the 4th day that week, to come on over, ignoring his wife's quite specific request for him to help her visit someone else that day whom she hasn't seen since their child was born.", "I hear ya."]}
