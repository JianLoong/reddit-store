My wife gave birth to our daughter 8.5 weeks ago. She doesn't go anywhere usually because she doesn't want to get the baby sick. So she's been to her mom's twice I believe and then 3 times to doctors appointments but outside of that she's been home full time. The only person who comes to our home to visit is my mother (my MIL doesn't have a working vehicle currently and my wife's one good friend- her cousin- doesn't have her license because shes afraid of driving). Typically my mom comes here a few times a week since my wife had the baby. Prior to that we only saw my mother maybe once a month.\n\nWell, on Saturday my wife said \"I want to go see Hannah\" in passing. Hannah is her cousin. I didn't really think anything of it because it wasn't a question and she wasn't asking me to drive her anywhere at that time (she isn't driving currently because of the C-section still causing some discomfort so I drive her everywhere). My mom called maybe like 15 minutes later and said \"I'm on my way to your place\". She typically doesn't ask and just tells me she's on her way but it's usually not an issue. So I just said \"alright, see you when you get here\". Well, my wife overheard and she's like \"who did you just invite here?\" So I told her my mom was on her way and she says \"are you fucking serious? I say I want to go to Hannah's and you invite your mom here? She's been here 4 times this week already. I'm so fucking tired of seeing her darken the doorway.\" This is the first time she said anything about not wanting my mom here so I was taken back and said \"you can go to Hannah's when my mom leaves. My mom is allowed to come here to see the baby.\" Well, my wife wasn't having that at all. She took the baby and went to the bedroom and by the time my mom got here, both her and the baby had fallen asleep and they didn't wake up until like 4 hours later. When she did get up she said she is sick and tired of my mom being here and that me prioritizing my mom wanting to come here over her wanting to get out of the house for once and go to Hannah's really \"sickened\" her and she's feeling repulsed by me and my actions. She said she's unable to look at me the same after that.", "created_utc": 1700149257, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17wpw34/aita_for_inviting_my_mom_here_right_after_my_wife/", "score": 181, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My wife went through something similar after our first was born -- didn't want to go anywhere, spent a lot of time with her mom, etc. And I think there's a good chance that you're compensating for this by allowing your mom to come over uninvited and whenever she wants. \n\n1) You need to set some boundaries. **Your mom is not \"allowed to come see the baby\"**  unless you invite her to do so. She shouldn't be coming to your place on a moment's notice -- ever -- without you inviting her. It's your house with your wife, not your mom's house. You can do this nicely: just tell your mom that you and your wife need some control over your life right now, given how chaotic everything is as a (first-time?) parent, and thank her in advance for understanding.\n\n2) Consider looking up ways to ask your wife about her emotional state without it seeming like you're blaming her. This is REALLY HARD so get advice from someone who has been through it before. (I can't remember how I handled it, sorry!) Maybe talk to her mom about it. The signs are there: won't go anywhere, unhappy for no obvious reason, etc.\n\n3) All of your actions should be seen through the prism of \"are you being kind to your wife right now?\" A few weeks ago, she was uncomfortable but free from a lot of obligations.

She doesn't go anywhere usually because she doesn't want to get the baby sick. So she's been to her mom's twice I believe and then 3 times to doctors appointments but outside of that she's been home full time. The only person who comes to our home to visit is my mother (my MIL doesn't have a working vehicle currently and my wife's one good friend- her cousin- doesn't have her license because shes afraid of driving). Typically my mom comes here a few times a week since my wife had the baby. Prior to that we only saw my mother maybe once a month.\n\nWell, on Saturday my wife said \"I want to go see Hannah\" in passing. Hannah is her cousin. I didn't really think anything of it because it wasn't a question and she wasn't asking me to drive her anywhere at that time (she isn't driving currently because of the C-section still causing some discomfort so I drive her everywhere). My mom called maybe like 15 minutes later and said \"I'm on my way to your place\". She typically doesn't ask and just tells me she's on her way but it's usually not an issue. So I just said \"alright, see you when you get here\". Well, my wife overheard and she's like \"who did you just invite her?\" So I told her my mom was on her way and she says \"are you fucking serious? I say I want to go to Hannah's and you invite your mom here? She's been here 4 times this week already. I'm so fucking tired of seeing her darken the doorway.\" This is the first time she said anything about not wanting my mom here so I was taken back and said \"you can go to Hannah's when my mom leaves. My mom is allowed to come here to see the baby.\" Well, my wife wasn't having that at all. She took the baby and went to the bedroom and by the time my mom got here, both her and the baby had fallen asleep and they didn't wake up until like 4 hours later. When she did get up she said she is sick and tired of my mom being here and that me prioritizing my mom wanting to come here over her wanting to get out of the house for once and go to Hannah's really \"sickened\" her and she's feeling repulsed by me and my actions. She said she's unable to look at me the same after that.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That is too much. I didn\u2019t even see MY OWN parents 4x a week when my kids were infants, let alone my in laws. No new mom wants people all up in their space when they\u2019re trying to heal up from birth. It takes A YEAR for a woman\u2019s body to fully recover from pregnancy and birth. 6+ months for hormones to get completely back to normal. You need to prioritize your wife and her comfort, not your mom and her feelings..and I say that as a mom of ALL boys. One day my kids are going to leave the nest and have families of their own and I am teaching them now that when you get married and choose a partner, they are your priority first. I had a horrible MIL who made my life hell. She taught me EXACTLY who I didn\u2019t want to be as a MIL. Sit down, talk to your wife. Ask her how she\u2019s feeling. Your Mom, whether YOU think so or not, is being too much, and your wife is telling you what she NEEDS right now. She\u2019s telling you that you are damaging your marriage and you\u2019re more concerned over \u201cit\u2019s my house too and I don\u2019t need permission\u201d? If you were my husband, you would be sleeping at your moms until you got your priorities in line. My husband added- You are a Dad now, you are your wife and child\u2019s protector and you\u2019re not doing a very good job of it. You need to get yourself right and be the husband and dad that your wife and baby deserve. If that was your daughter telling you these things and she was upset like that, how would that make you feel?", "Dude, it's not even about asking permission. Pretty much every couple I know that live together will check with their partner before inviting someone over. It seems like you're clearly allowed to have your mother over since she's at your house constantly. It's not a matter of permission, it's a matter of care and courtesy for your partner.\n\nMy husband knows I love his sister who lives near us, he still checks in when she's coming to make sure we don't have scheduling issues or that I'm mentally up for guests.\n\nYour wife recently went through a massive medical event and now has an infant to look after. Post partum is an insanely difficult time for anyone. And she's been basically trapped in the house for weeks without access to her friends or family, but too much access to your mother.\n\nTell your mom to maybe space out her visits a bit more and see what you can do to facilitate your wife seeing the people that bring her comfort. Offer to go pick up her mother or cousin or drive her to them.", "> I don't feel like I should be required to ask permission for my mom to come here honestly.\n\nYes both parties need to agree on people coming over.  \n\nPlus you told your wife to stay for your mother.  Yes you need your wife's agreement then because you're signing her up for this.\n\n> She's never communicated not wanting my mom here before.\n\nNo sane person would miss how your mother being over without asking is an issue.  Damn man.  You need to learn to cut the umbilical cord.", "You don\u2019t have to ask permission for your mother to come over 5 times in a week, but the first time your wife mentions wanting to go somewhere that isn\u2019t her mother\u2019s house or a doctor, you don\u2019t bother to ask about that either. You just assume your wife didn\u2019t mean what she said, you just assume that she wants to see your mother more than she probably sees even you, and you just assume that because you live there you can decide what baby and wife are allowed to do. \n\nDude, your wife\u2019s right. You didn\u2019t listen to her because she didn\u2019t word it right. \n\nIn your own post you said your wife didn\u2019t ask you to take her to Hannah\u2019s, she told you. You decided that means she didn\u2019t really want that. \n\nIn your own post you said your mother didn\u2019t ask you to show up, she told you. You decided that this must then happen and that your wife *did* want that. \n\nHere\u2019s a life lesson for you: stop pretending you\u2019re a mind reader. You\u2019re not, and you\u2019re pretty bad at it. Talk to your wife and apologize. Offer to take her to Hannah\u2019s. Ask her how often is fair for your mother to come over (seriously, five times in one week is massively excessive. She\u2019s seeing your mother as often as she would a coworker/boss at a *full time job*, and she has to feel like she\u2019s entertaining at the same time; that\u2019s not ok). \n\nTell mom no. Uninvited popping over in a married persons home is absolutely *not ok*. Five minute warning calls are not appropriate communications and request for visiting. \n\nYour mom was ok not dropping by except once a month for the majority of your relationship. Over 8 weeks have gone by, your wife has left the house five times (by your count), still hasn\u2019t even healed enough to be able to just go out to get out without you acting as an Uber driver, and she has seen her mother twice. Meanwhile, she has seen your mother *at least* 30 times. In 8.5 weeks, she has spent more than an *entire month* with your mother. \n\nBefore you say she didn\u2019t say anything before so you had no way to know, please do the math. \n\n- We are talking about approximately 76 days since the baby has been born. \n- she has left the house 5x since the birth. Your wife has been out of the house for 6% of your child\u2019s entire life. \n- she has spent 2% of your child\u2019s life visiting with her mother. \n- assuming your mother *only* has \u201cdarkened your doorway\u201d 30x since the birth of your baby, your wife has spent nearly ***40%*** of the life of your child stuck in the house with your mother who doesn\u2019t even think to call ahead and ask. \n- you admit that you don\u2019t think your mother needs to ask, which means your wife has not been asked at any point, just informed. So your mother has stated and gotten what she wanted 40% of the time. \n- your wife stated that she wanted to do one thing in 8.5 weeks. That means that she has stated (not asked) for what she wanted to do 1.3% of the life of your child. \n- mom got her way, wife didn\u2019t. Wife was able to say what she wanted and have it done by you exactly 0% of your child\u2019s life. \n\nLooking at it that way, I truly hope that you can see why YTA for this one.", "You're being intentionally obtuse. Use your brain and take care of your partner.", "So you think its appropriate for your mother to go from visiting once a month to 4 times a week without asking if your wide is comfortable with it? Your mother isn't coming to see you. \n\nYour wife told you she wanted to go, you know she needs you to drive her, perhaps when your mother called you should have checked with your wife when she was planning to go, not assume that it was something she was \"figuring out\".", "Bet you felt *real* good about yourself when you realized your mom only came over for the baby and NOT because she wanted to spend time with YOU.", "But you also told your wife \u201cyou can go to Hannah\u2019s when my mom leaves.\u201d\n\nIf you want to assert your ability to have your mother over unilaterally, that\u2019s questionable since it\u2019s a shared home. You definitely can\u2019t assert that your wife can\u2019t leave, to go visit her cousin which she had already expressed an interest in doing, until your mother leaves. And your wife showed you that you approving your mother visiting applies to you only. You don\u2019t get to unilaterally decide that your wife or your shared child is available for your mother to see.\n\nBTW your mother going from visiting about once a month, to visiting for over half the days in the week, is extremely intrusive.", "Dude. I REALLY hope this thread opens you up to self reflection, fast.", "And that would be an argument if you lived alone, but in a shared household you need to be considerate to the other people who live there. It's your mother so you should communicate boundaries to her - she's evidently outstanding her welcome and it's stressing your wife out to constantly host her.", "> She's never communicated not wanting my mom here before.\n\nI bet she has and you just refused to listen.
