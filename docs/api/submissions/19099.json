But she\u2019s literally trying to give you a list of \u201creserved\u201d names? Ridiculous.", "NTA Nobody owns a name, especially someone who isn't even pregnant.", "NTA. If she was asking for one or two specific names for some specific and meaningful reason, I\u2019d be graceful and let her \u201creserve\u201d them. She can\u2019t have them all though, and especially family names that might be equally special to you and your husband as her is not okay. I think you need to talk to your husband about it and get on the same page. Is one she wants to reserve on your list too?", "The very concept of calling \"dibs\" on baby names may be the dumbest thing I've read about on the internet today, and that's saying something. Doing it under the circumstances described here is double so. NTA a thousand times over.", "NTA. \n\nYour husbands sister is way out of line. It\u2019s one thing to ask for a single particular name, but to have an entire list is just absurd. Even at that, babies can have the same name, as it\u2019s not that uncommon.", "NTA. No one  can reserve a name, and cousins can have the same name, so go ahead and name your daughter whatever you want, and IF she ever has a baby girl, she can do the same.  But you would be the AH if you discuss this topic further with her. Just thank her for the information if she brings it up again, and if she pushes for an answer, just say that you and she have a difference of opinion about this. And keep repeating that as many times as you need to.", "NTA. You're having the kid, you get the first draft pick. If there was one name she was super into, maybe that's a conversation you can have, but she doesn't get a whole list of carveouts just in case she decides to give birth to an entire baseball lineup sometime down the line.", "NTA. And according to the list, how many children does she expect to have?", "NTA.\n\nShe\u2019s projecting her future fantasy world on your actual reality. It\u2019s not like she said \u201cI would like X for a girl, and Y for a boy\u201d. She said \u201chere\u2019s a huge ass list\u201d and that\u2019s entitled AF.\n\nY\u2019all aren\u2019t fighting over one or two specific family names. She sounds like a princess used to having her demands met.", "NTA. Sis better get to sl*ttin' it up if she wants all those names!", "NTA. You could just as well tell her that actually, you've reserved every possible name, so any children she has must remain nameless. Ridiculous.", "NTA chose them all", "NTA! it\u2019s your baby, it would be a problem if she told you the baby names long before you were pregnant and you picked one specifically off her list but other than that it\u2019s your baby.

You can use whatever name you want. There is no such thing as dibs on names", "NTA who ever has a kid first gets first pick of names. Especially if this girl has a long list.

However if she came to you with 1 or 2 names she wants to use then sure but not an entire baby name book of names. \n\nWhen I got pregnant my BIL just called dibs on one name that he has always wanted to name a girl. We didn\u2019t really like the name anyway but we\u2019re having a boy so it never mattered. Our family knows our baby girl name so they will likely avoid it out of courtesy but we are likely to finish having kids before any family starts having kids with our age and life stage difference.", "NTA\nJust ignore her list. She can't call dibs on a name for a child who may never exist.", "I would pick my daughters first and middle name from her list,just for the audacity she has thinking she\u2019s allowed to dictate your kids name!!

Talk to your husband about what his sibling was like growing up, if she was an attention seeking/drama type person. If she had one or two names she was deadest on, fine, but a whole list?  \n\n\nEdit: Talk it out with your spouse, and choose the name you would of chosen anyway and don't let your in-law taint the experience.", "NTA.
