Her list is long enough so she will have alternatives.", "NTA, use any name,  especially family names that you want too,  how does she even know she can get pregnant? Or the guy she marries doesn't shoot blanks?? \n\nThen you are stuck with a name you're not in love with..", "NTA\n\nLord she's an interesting one eh? Also how many kids is she planning that she needs all those names?\n\nPick whatever name you like. The worst she can do is be mad and oops don't care \ud83d\ude0f Your need for a name is a lot more immediate than hers", "NTA! You are free to choose whatever name you and your partner like for your baby girl. \n\nIf she had one or two names she absolutely loves, then she could have asked nicely and you would most likely be willing to avoid those. To give you a long list of names to avoid is just plain rude. And to bring it up in that way and setting just shows how little respect she has for anyone but herself.\n\nAnd to be honest she might not end up using any of them, even if she gets a litter of girls later on.. We had a long list of favorite names for our girl, but when we had her and went through the list we felt like none of them were her. We ended up with a completely different name that wasn't even on the list to begin with, and it's perfect for her!\n\nJust a little tip on the side. When people ask what babynames you guys are thinking of, share some of them but not your absolute favorite names. In my experience people can be rude and have a way of ruining them by sharing their bad associations with the name or making jokes of them. \n\nGood luck finding a wonderful name for your little princess!", "NTA. What an idiot.", "NTA\n\nYou dont need to consider her preferences at all. To keep her on her good side however, you could tell her to pick 3 or 5 names that she would like to \"reserve\". That way you meet her halfway, regardless of how ridiculous her point of view is.", "NTA pick the one she likes most lol", "What\u2019s stopping you from choosing any name you wish? Seriously, I don\u2019t see where the obstacle is exactly. Am I missing something here?", "NTA the cheek of her!", "Shes not going to be there when you register your babies name. She can't stop you", "NTA - first come first served. She\u2019s not even pregnant.", "NTA. She needs to get laid.", "NTA. What's wrong with her?", "Wait until she finds out that the way that family names become family names is they are used over and over within the same family. So you have multiple cousins each generation named Rebecca, or Michael, or Corriander, or Gustoff. And then families develop ways to be specific so one is Reba, one is Becky, one is Becca. Or it's Corriander's Gustoff vs. Michael's Gustoff. Or little Mikey vs. big Mike. \n\nYou are NTA and she is being silly and doesn't know how names work.", "The whole dibs on baby names stuff is ridiculous. The name my mum wanted to call me, she wasn\u2019t allowed to use because her sister threw a fit when I was born (same sister didn\u2019t end up using the name for her three daughters\u2026) The names I always thought I\u2019d use for my son and daughter were out because my husband didn\u2019t like the names- I also never called dibs on them to friends. I remember being told I couldn\u2019t use two particular names by a friend when I was pregnant and being annoyed because one of those names was on my list, I didn\u2019t use it but it\u2019s a bit petty. The only time I think it\u2019s acceptable is if you are pregnant and tell a relative who is also pregnant that you want to use a particular name so could they please not (even then\u2026 when my SIL and I were pregnant at the same time, she was due first so my figuring was whatever she chose when bub arrived, we obviously couldn\u2019t use for ours, it wasn\u2019t an issue)", "NTA. My daughter's middle name is a family one, my BIL and his wife chose it for their daughter's first name as they forgot (tbh I don't know my neices and nephews middle names so am in no position yo judge - also idgaf). They were apologetic but I honestly didn't care - it's a nice name! Owning names is ridiculous. For what it's worth both of my female cousins have met and married men with the same first and last names, we manage not to get confused or make anyone change their names.", "NTA. Tell her to pick 3 if you want to be nice.", "NTA. And according to the list, how many children does she expect to have?", "i giggled \ud83e\udd2d \n\nalso nta OP", "NTA. You could just as well tell her that actually, you've reserved every possible name, so any children she has must remain nameless. Ridiculous.", "I think that name maybe reserved as well", "It's funny how people think they own the names of their future children AND ALSO GET MAD if you plan to use any of them. So many problems in the world and some get upset over such silly and basic matters.", "Iike the name anyway but we\u2019re having a boy so it never mattered. Our family knows our baby girl name so they will likely avoid it out of courtesy but we are likely to finish having kids before any family starts having kids with our age and life stage difference.", "NTA. And according to the list, how many children does she expect to have?", "[removed]", "oing it under the circumstances described here is double so. NTA a thousand times over.", "Tell her to eat shit and pick whatever you want.", "You say bless, but I hear the word differently. :-)", "Even if OP ends up using one of the names, SIL will still have a laundry list of other names she likes. I don't see the issue.", "I've already read two different stories here today of people asking extended family members to rename their pets because they want those names for their babies, and don't want to share the names with the animals that came first.vI'd say those can compete with this.\n\nAbsolutely NTA, OP. Your SIL is insane.", " you get the first draft pick. If there was one name she was super into, maybe that's a conversation you can have, but she doesn't get a whole list of carveouts just in case she decides to give birth to an entire baseball lineup sometime down the line.", "I think that name maybe reserved as well", "Be hilarious if when she does pick a mate, he hates all the names on her list!", "It was her brothers (the father's) family first too. He has just as much right to use family names from their family as his sister. The only difference is, they are actually expecting a child who they may want to use a family name for. \n\nJust because OP is the one carrying the baby, doesn't make them not family enough by relation to the father to have a family name.", "Didn't you know. She plans on having one for every star in the sky or at minimum the whole alphabet", "All of them. Obviously.\n\nNTA", "If she has like four names for eatch that shrinks the total number of kids. And if she has names with hyphen she could have like eight names in total for one kid. (Is that common with English names though? I don't recall seeing those.)
