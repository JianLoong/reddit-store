Please view our [voting guide here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_what.2019s_with_these_acronyms.3F_what_do_they_mean.3F), and remember to use **only one** judgement in your comment.\n\nOP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:\n\n > The action I took that should be judged is tricking my old roommate out of the house and packing up and moving while they were gone.\nThis action might make me the asshole because instead of just telling her she needed to leave, I lied to her to get her out of the house and moved out while she was gone. Then I packed up her stuff and mailed her a letter stating what happened and why, and telling her how to get her belongings.\nShe called me an asshole because she stated that I should've just told her to leave and talked to her about it like an adult. I believe I did things the only way that was feasible because she has anger issues and is incapable of having adult discussions. She would scream, berate me, and try to make me and my SO feel like we were stupid. Because of events that had recently happened, my MH and SE were in a bad place and I couldn't stand up for myself very well. Since I've gotten away from her, things have gotten so much better and my life has completely turned around. So I believe my actions were justified.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019m not even sure why she thought she would be moving in with you guys to your new place. She doesn\u2019t even pay rent or utilities and her stay was always meant to be temporary. Based on her behavior it was probably best that it was done this way to prevent any unnecessary stress on you. You told her she wasn\u2019t coming with you and she mistook that as an option and thought there was room for disagreement. That\u2019s her problem. She knew when she would have to be out by. It was very nice of you to let her stay and even continue to stay past what was planned but for some reason she feels entitled to your kindness. Did she think all three of you were going to move into a place and she was going to keep not having to pay anything?", "Oh my goodness NTA\n\nI'm so sorry. I've dealt with a friend like Amy and I feel your pain.

If she had called the cops they would have forced you to let her back in. After living there for months, she established residency and needed to be formally evicted.", "I've never done anything like that before, that's why I'm on the fence about whether it was wrong or not. Things have been so incredible since, but my conscience still eats at me for it.", "It's actually funny you said that last line... My mom inherited quite a bit from my grandmother's investments. Due to my grandma not having a will, I didn't inherit anything. My mom, understanding how awful it was that I had to suddenly pack up and move, decided that she would put a certain amount of the money that she inherited towards me and my SO getting a new place. She paid the security deposit and first month's rent, and whatever was left she would put towards our monthly rent payments until the amount was maxed out. Abby knew this, because in casual conversation we had talked about things like \"how are you going to afford a new place\" & whatnot. She assumed that she was going to move in with us, and that my mom was going to pay everything. She didn't take into consideration that she was DEMANDING we get a four-bedroom house because she needed a bedroom and an office space. I have one daughter. Me and my SO ended up with a 2 bedroom rental house with an additional \"bonus room\" (my office space). $1275/mo. 4 bedroom houses were going to be around $2k/mo. So she expected my mom to pay all of that extra money, in-tern making the rent money not last as long, AND I wasn't even going to have access to the \"office space\" in the house. I have a full-time job that's partially work-from-home. Insanity.", "It's not weird at all. You're beautiful for saying so. \u2764\ufe0f", "Well, get your butt off the fence.  You did nothing wrong. At all.", "Oh, & I forgot to mention... The final straw for me was when she provided me with a RECEIPT of money that I apparently owed her for things she purchased for me. Random shit, like slippers and clothes. She bought an air fryer so that I could cook her food the way she LIKED.", "??? So she demanded you pay more for a bigger house so she can have two out of four rooms and none of which she paying a dime for? Is she on drugs?   How did she expect the house to be paid for once the money from your mom ran out cuz I\u2019m 100% sure she had no intention on ever chipping in. Let alone think she had any kind of authority to make DEMANDS ON A HOUSE SHES NOT PAYING FOR. Goes to show how much she really \u201ccares\u201d for you as a \u201cfriend\u201d. I will say though the audacity is astonishing.", "You gotta be fucking kidding me. The more you tell me the more I think it was a good idea what you did. She sounds like the type to try and be spiteful. And once she realized that she REALLY wasn\u2019t moving in with you she would have done her best to cause as much damage as possible before she left. Providing you with a receipt is insane because that means she\u2019s been keeping track all of this time actually expecting to be paid back \ud83d\udc80 the entitlement is off the charts rn.", "She always bragged about how she made over $100k a year with her two jobs, and said she was worried about me and my SO being able to pay the bills and our portion of the rent. Meanwhile we make close to what she claimed to make combined?
