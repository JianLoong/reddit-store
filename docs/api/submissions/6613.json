You never knew her. You had no connection to her.  How is it an honor to be named after a stranger who died as an infant and (sadly) never did anything?  \n\nThey were willing to compromise your quality of life for the sake of an empty show of reverence to someone who was a stranger to you. They're your parents.  They're supposed to think of your long term well-being and put that first.  They failed to do that.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou are an adult with your own agency. They did not have to live your experiences and put up with the bullying. You did that. You honored your aunt by living that experience in her stead.\n\nI guarantee your aunt would have disliked her name too for the same reasons you dislike it.\n\nTo me, honoring someone is an ongoing activity you partake in. Not a one-time thing.\n\nNaming your child after someone to honor them is a one-time deal. If that was the only \"honoring\" your parents did for your aunt, I guess it makes sense why they're pissed you would \"take that one action away from them\".\n\nIn my Asian-American **opinion** (only pointing out we may have cultural differences), it in no way dishonors your aunt by choosing to not wear her name as your own anymore. You are not her. It's time she is allowed to be her own person.\n\nYou should be allowed to be loved for who **you** are, not who your aunt may have been.\n\nYou should not have to live with the guilt your parents branded you with the moment they named you after a relative who didn't get to live life.", "NTA.

I work in HR for a company that has at least 1,500 employees at any given time, and hires a lot if people on a short term basis every year, so I see a LOT of names. I feel bad for people who have oddly spelled names because the will be going through Life spelling that name every single time they use it.  It will be mispronounced and you will spend a lifetime correcting people who may or may not ever listen to you when you do, i.e. people like your teacher. \nI probably would have told the family about it first and maybe kept Ocienna as a middle name just to keep the peace, but I\u2019m frightened of confrontation and dissension. \nNope, I don\u2019t blame you one bit. Enjoy your new name!", "NTA it's your name and you have to live with it. Having it as a middle name isn't a bad idea. Maybe try and talk to your parent about how you love your aunt but don't want her name and see if they would be happy with it as your middle name. Not sure how expensive it is but if it is maybe they could pay for it.", "NTA. It's your name, and it's your life. You are a human being, not a decorative trinket.", "I changed my last name when I was 22 because it was truly awful, especially combined with my middle name, something my parents overlooked.

You honored that name for 21 years and now it\u2019s your turn to choose a more suitable name", "NTA\n\n\nParents who saddle their children with names that are ridiculously difficult to pronounce or after a fandom are bordering on abuse.

But as *your* name ... it's your name, your an adult. if they have a problem with it... they should have been adults and thought about consequences of potential names.

In the internet age, it has made finding me trivially easy. My mom and dad weren't sentenced to a lifetime of this mess, so they don't accept my explanation for wanting to change my own name.\n\nI understand your parents' attachment to your aunt's name and all, but if they want it so badly, THEY can change their name to it. It's not your job to keep someone else's memory alive. You are not a scrapbook.
