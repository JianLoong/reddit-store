Kids aren't dumb, they're gonna know. If you ask me, I'd say spend your money how you want to, and if you want to buy your child a gift, great! If it makes your siblings look like selfish entitled buttholes, not your fault you love your child enough to get them a gift. I hope you and your partner have a great Christmas...kinda feel for the kids though, I'd make them a batch of cookies, just a little something to remind them that they are thought of and cared for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat pisses me is that a child's gift is cheaper than expensive booze.", "This is real? There are adults who think they deserve a visit from Santa over children?? NTA. These people are ridiculous. To purposefully buy gifts that are inappropriate for familiar children so they can\u2019t have them is on another level.\n\nAnd how is explicitly asking for people not to get you anything considered selfish?", "NTA. Your siblings just want presents and don't give a bahumbug about the kids' possibly fragile feelings. They wait 365 days for a day of pure joy and they would rather make it so that the adults (including themselves)  are the only ones getting gifts. \n\nA child's innocence and joy is, in my opinion, the best part of that holiday. Taking that away and giving it to people who have had time to harden up is just downright cruel.", "NTA\n\nOn my dad\u2019s side of the family, there are 35 of us in my generation. The family went to just getting presents for the kids first, and then as the number of cousins grew, to a system where the adults drew names of kids, so you\u2019d get one nice gift from one aunt/uncle, instead of lots of little inexpensive things.\n\nAdults demanding to be gifted at Christmas over their own kids just sounds greedy to me.", "NTA. It sounds like a few people have some hang ups about how the kids in the family have been provided for and are feeling stung by it. It strikes me as really peculiar that some family members are trying to set rules for how others gift give. Surely that dampens the spirit of genuine gifting.\n\nWhat happens to their proposed arrangement when a kid turns 18? Do they suddenly receive gifts or is it their generation that's barred?\n\nYour suggestion was totally reasonable - presents just for kids. There are so many alternatives too. Whole family gifts (e.g. games, experiences, etc), or pooling gift money for a day out that everyone will enjoy, theming gifts around something inexpensive and usable (e.g. favourite sweet treats, wacky socks, etc). SO many alternatives that are more appropriate than having all the kids watch you open things.", "NTA. I feel like your suggestion is a pretty common one among extended families. My family buys gifts for the kids and then secret Santa or white elephant for the adults.", "NTA. Your family is being super weird. Almost stuck up, like kids aren\u2019t real people or something. Run far from them. Maybe get all the kids something and no one else. Just as a fuck you.", "NTA, What a bunch of holiday killjoys.   They are basically saying \"if you don't buy for me, you can't buy for anyone \".  I personally,  would scrap having Christmas with them and have my own family holiday.", "NTA. It seems a bit mean to exclude kids from a gift exchange when the adults will be opening gifts. It's annoying when one person in the family makes decisions for everyone. In my family, there are about the same number of kids as there are adults. Every adult gets 'assigned' one kid to get a gift for so every kid gets one gift, not a pile. For the adults, we do a secret Santa game. Every adult brings one wrapped gender-neutral (ie, no perfume) gift that costs about $40.Those gifts are put in a pile.  Everyone gets a number. The person with number 1 picks first, person 2 picks second etc. Swapping gifts is allowed.  It sounds complicated, but it works. It means that we don't have to buy dozens of presents and we don't have to take home dozens of presents.", "NTA.\n\nWow, your in-laws sound like they're straight out of a Dickens novel, and not as the protagonists. Yikes! Those poor kids!\n\nAny adult who thinks that kids should be completely left out of opening gifts, while the adults sit around on their fat, selfish asses opening gifts, are horrible people.

We all know that gifts shouldn't be transactional but that doesn't change the fact that it does end up financially lopsided. Abd then there's the birthdays, graduations  etc..\n\nMore importantly, when folks start wanting to limit presents given it is often due to potentially undisclosed out of embarrassment) financial hardship.

I agree with you 100 percent.", "NTA \n\nYou're absolutely right that if there is a need on cutting back in the number of present, it's the children who should get presents. Adults are old enough to just buy whatever they want/need and should be over the need to receive presents aut a family Christmas get-together (I'm assuming that each couple with or without their respective kids is still having their own private gift giving moment).

I have a bunch of siblings and, when we saw everyone, for Christmas the rule was that nieces/nephews get gifts and childless siblings get gifts. Everyone else is left out of the sibling equation.", "NTA\n\nDon't buy anything for those \"adults\" and buy for the kids. They won't be buying *you* anything anyway.

It's not a problem.", "Give all the adults coal maybe the can use it to warm up their icy hearts.\n\nI agree kids, and adults too, have a lot of crap they don't need which is why we switched to gifting experiences.

I agree that Christmas is about the kids, but I also understand how it it feel to be the one with no/less kids in this situation.  If I was a sibling with no children, and I always had to buy for the 7 kids but my family never received anything (no kids to \u201cbenefit\u201d from this scenario) I would feel a little excluded as well. The fairest thing would be for every person to draw a name for another so everyone gets to have a gift and no one feels left out. No one wants to be left out at Christmas, it brings out the kid in all of us. And asking someone to sit out completely and just buy for everyone else is going to hurt some feelings. Yes, I get the most joy out of watching my kid open presents, but Christmas is supposed to be about family, even the old and childless people.\n\nI guess NTA, but there\u2019s definitely more room for finding a good compromise that would work for everyone", "Hi, from a big extended family.  We hit this point right around where you are, and what has worked for us was instituting a \"white elephant\" where everyone brings a wrapped piece of crap they have lying around and puts it under the tree.  Then we all pick names out of a hat and each person gets to pick the present they want.  That way nobody has to spend a bunch of money, and nobody has to think about \"what so and so might actually want\".  Plus, everyone who wants to participate only has to bring one gift.

It seems entitled to think that everyone should buy games for your kids. \n\nI have 2 small kids and love Christmas being special for them and my Christmas presents tend to be for them also and not for me, BUT it is also nice to be given something for just me. I\u2019m more than a mom and I also enjoy Christmas. I would also NEVER try to make it so my husbands brothers who aren\u2019t married didn\u2019t get anything on Christmas and just got stuff for my kids and the nieces and nephews. \n\nChristmas is for everyone not just children.\n\nEdit: something we do on my husband\u2019s side of the family for Christmas is everyone draws a name and gets a present for them and then we also have the kids draw names for each other. This way everyone gets presents and gets to enjoy christmas\n\nEdit: and then of course \u201cSanta\u201d brings presents for our kids as well so they get plenty for Christmas. It\u2019s just not relied upon family to get them the presents", "Nothing wrong with a little free for all now and again. Maybe it\u2019ll wake them up and they\u2019ll see how misguided they\u2019re being.", "Thanks for the clarification, curious and curiouser but you have to love family dynamics. \n\nThey\u2018re being childish of course so NTA but I would gently suggest that proposals that stop your partners siblings receiving presents are much better suggested and argued by him. People can be very sensitive to changes to Christmas protocols you don\u2019t want that target on your back! Good luck", "They sound kind of Scrooge-y and that sucks. Either way, it\u2019s a little harder on kids to sit and watch everyone else have something they don\u2019t. They won\u2019t be able to process that, so I don\u2019t understand their reasoning for excluding them entirely. But, most people have been brought up with the \u201cChristmas is for the kids\u201d and that leads to\u2026adults who are no longer kids being bummed for getting cut off and maybe becoming Scrooges?", "This is how we do things too. My one sister and brother in law don\u2019t have kids, but always buys for my kids and my nieces. So my other sister and I buy a gift for them from the kids for Christmas and birthdays. I think there\u2019s a compromise to be made here, but it seems like your in-laws are adamant about not buying gifts for the kids, which is pretty wild.", "I really don't see an issue with their plan. There's nothing wrong with adults getting gifts and it's not like the children don't get any gifts.", "So you don't have to give the adults gift. As I said before no one has the right tell anyone else what to do with their money. You didn't get to tell his sibilings how to spend their money and they don't get to tell you how to spend yours. If it is turning into something contentious with the family than maybe it is best if you and your husband do your own thing with your kids for Christmas.", "Hey husband's family is making her the scapegoat but she put herself in the position to be made the scapegoat.", "i will actually! bc my family isnt full of entitled ppl who cant compromise", "That sounds like fun.", "My fiance's fraternity does that and it is very fun.\n\nHave done it a few times when I was in high school as well in a couple classes.\n\nWe had the two steal rule, so a couple gifts didn't just get passed around all night.", "100% agree with this comment. This is exactly what OP is expecting. For his childfree family to subsidize his kids.", "That\u2019s ok. It does feel a little selfish of me for advocating for presents for kids who do have enough and will get other presents for Christmas. \n\nI do want to clarify that I am all for everyone young and old to get a little something, I just suggested that if we cut anyone out it\u2019s not kids and if someone wants to buy my family something spend the money on my kid and not me.", ">Edit: and then of course \u201cSanta\u201d brings presents for our kids as well so they get plenty for Christmas. It\u2019s just not relied upon family to get them the presents\n\nIt sound like your kids get presents every christmas. How would they react if you suddenly decided that they would not get any this christmas. Only you and the other adults get them. They'll remember that years Christmas as the saddest or worst Christmas ever.\n\nTo me its the contrast that matters. This family sounds like they are used to getting presents. I don't think any child who is used to getting Christmas presents is going to look forward to a christmas that suddenly is about only adults or booze. Fine if no one gets a present, at least that's fair to everyone. The kids will probably remember the adults as selfish assholes. Like try explaining to kids that they're not getting presents because everyone agreed. They didn't agree on anything, they have no say.", "It appears the kids won\u2019t be getting any gifts at this holiday gathering while the adults will be getting gifts. You don\u2019t see anything wrong with that?? I think it\u2019s bizarre for an adult to think they\u2019re entitled to gifts and think it\u2019s okay for children to sit at a Christmas celebration and get no gifts while watching adults open wine and liquor", "That\u2019s good! I\u2019m glad for you. Thanks for everything you added to the conversation \ud83d\ude0a", "It is! A lot of the gifts tend to be joke ones, food, or sometimes booze. Some of the best last year: a bathroom poop joke book, a product that is meant to make your car cup holder bigger but was actually smaller overall lol, and a drinking hat that was full of typos!", "Here's [a way to play it](http://thewritersgreenhouse.blogspot.com/2014/12/how-to-play-present-game.html?m=1). You can also do a simpler version where each person can choose a wrapped present or steal someone's opened present. If your opened present gets stolen, you choose a wrapped one.", "Yep, same! We always cap the steals lol", "I think it\u2019s totally acceptable to say that if someone is getting you a gift get it for your child instead. For the most part I do this as well as I love seeing them happy. \n\nBut I don\u2019t agree that the child free siblings shouldn\u2019t get anything and just get stuff for the kids. Could you have the kids get something for each other so they get something to open and it doesn\u2019t impede on the childless siblings Christmas?", "Maybe I misread it/misunderstood but it sounded like to me it was presents from family and I guess I assumed the kids would get something from their parents as well. \n\nIf this is all the kids are getting for Christmas I honestly wouldn\u2019t get anyone in the family anything and just get my kids something so they could have a great Christmas.", "No I don't think it's anything wrong with that. The kids will have already opened gifts earlier in the day. Kids can understand that they don't always get gift, the same way they can go to someone else's birthday party and realize that it's that person's turn to get gifts and not theirs.", "She just said she wanted everyone to get a little something. She\u2019s not making a big deal about excluding the adults, it\u2019s the adults wanting to exclude the kids.", ">Childless siblings wanted the kids not to get any gifts, so its only fair to bacfire on them..", "So you think it\u2019s okay to teach that lesson to children but not okay for adults to sit around and not open presents? Totally bizarre. The adults in this family are basically throwing a tantrum about not getting Christmas gifts.", "A birthday party is a whole different situation.  There is a lesson to be learned there - today is about celebrating this child, because it is his/her birthday.  \n\nThe lesson learned from a Christmas where only adults get gifts is what?  Christmas is about celebrating grownups??\n\nLike there just is no *reason* for the grownups to get presents and the kids not to get presents.  I am absolutely all about teaching my kids about the spirit of giving.  But when you are surrounded by only takers on Christmas, I don't know if that lesson will really resonate.\n\nAlso, birthday parties are FUN.  Sure, all the kids aren't getting presents.  But they are jumping in a bounce house, playing with friends, eating cake.  Christmas is fun because they are tearing into a new toy.  Only these kids will now... be sitting around, watching the grownups booze it up, waiting for the day of boring, selfish adult stuff to end.", "Sucks that your wife is related to the grinch and Ebenezer.\n\nNTA\n\nMy sister and I decided years ago that we didn't buy presents for each other, but we still shay's bought for the children.\n\nI would show up with gifts for the actual children,  but none for the \"adults\" acting like spoilt children.", "NTA\n\nSimple solution to this problem. You and your children should stay home.", "Ok barring fertility issues, I would buy baby gifts for the childless siblings. To be extra petty I would personalize them as well so they can\u2019t be regifted. \n\nThe golden rule of Christmas is it\u2019s the thought that counts and you can\u2019t complain about a gift. Let\u2019s see how they like excluding children from presents. NTA", "NTA I would honestly inform them that I would rather not receive anything from them, and that I would be having Christmas with my immediate family. And politely ask to be removed from the email List. they don\u2019t sound like a group of people worth being around your child.", "Please gift both siblings either A Christmas Carol or The Grinch. We do Secret Santa for the grownups but the kids all get presents. I'd be ashamed to be a grownup opening presents while a bunch of kids look on and get nothing.", "ESH just have everyone pull a name to do gift exchange. It's not fair to exclude kids, nor is it fair for the child- free couple to need to buy 7 kid gifts.", "AwwW12q", "Just a question if it was gifts just for the kids then does that mean the people that don't have children would get nothing? How many people don't have children?", "NTA and I think it's weird the adults in your family are so hung up on getting presents, particularly at the expense of kids. \n\nI grew up in a reasonably large extended family - there were 16 grandkids - and our solution was that all the grandkids' names went into a hat and each aunt/uncle would draw a name and be responsible for that kid. So all the kids ended up with something to open at the family Christmas party (and usually more because my grandparents still gave all the kids something and we usually got something from our God parents as well) while no one had to spend a bundle. Kids 'aged out' at 18 and everyone seemed happy with the system.", "NTA I may get told off but Christmas is such a joyous time well it should be for children. I have a daughter and I buy for the children in my family instead of adults and we are all happy with that. The joy I get from seeing a lil one enjoy their gifts is my gift", "NTA. I always insist during my family gift exchange that it simply be one family themed gift per family that entered. If the kids arnt included I dont do it cuz I have enough stress without watching little kids cry during dinner.", "What was wrong with secret Santa? That\u2019s 1 gift per person participating", "NTA.\n\nChristmas is for kids, especially if you're a secular family. Let the adults draw straws for Secret Santas. A lot of adults don't care about gifts, anyway. But kids always do.", "NTA I wouldn't go", "7 kids may be too much, totally get it. But then they could just not buy gifts for anyone. Or just get each of the kids something cheap, everybody gets a Christmas pop-it, or some flavored cocoa, or just give each kid 5 bucks. Christmas is about giving, not getting. And it is for children. I was plenty happy to buy presents for my nieces and cousin's kids long before I had my own", "Abso-fucking-lutely.", ">Adults demanding to be gifted at Christmas over their own kids just sounds greedy to me\n\nThe \"adults\" trying to exclude the children are the ones that don't have children.", "We do a \u201cfamily gift\u201d and rotate names - it\u2019s helpful as the families have different numbers of children, from 0 up to 6, with 13 total.  A \u201cfamily\u201d gift essentially is about the kids, but means we don\u2019t go broke the year we have the sibling with 6 kids.", "This all the way", "Getting presents for ONLY the adults is absolutely 100% ridiculous, i don't see how you can possibly call OP TA for not wanting the kids excluded.", "I don\u2019t think that is what they are saying - more that Christmas can also suck if you are a childless adult that is expected to buy a bunch of presents but get nothing.  It\u2019s not that kids should be excluded.", "The childfree adults want to not get their niblings gifts, but to receive fancy bottles of booze. \n\nThey can either have a family Christmas, or they can have an adult, booze-gift Christmas, but they can't have both at the same time.", "Lol no, my kid will get presents from me. I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s necessary to subsidize their booze collections while the kids get nothing.", "Agree 100%. I don\u2019t understand what lesson they\u2019re trying to teach little kids by having them get no presents while they watch a bunch of adults open vodka. Seems wild to me, but I guess people do things differently."]}
