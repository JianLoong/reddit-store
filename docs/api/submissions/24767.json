I've been planning this day for years, and I can't wait to finally celebrate with my loved ones.\n\nBut there's one thing that's been causing me some stress: my sister's dog. She's a small, friendly dog, but I'm worried about it being a distraction during the ceremony and reception. I also don't want to have to worry about the dog getting lost or injured.\n\nI've talked to my sister about this, and she's really upset that I'm not letting her bring the dog. She says that the dog is part of her family, and that she won't be able to come to the wedding if she can't bring the dog.\n\nI feel bad for my sister, but I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to ruin her day, but I also don't want to compromise on my wedding day.\n\nI've thought about a few different solutions. I could let the dog stay with a friend or family member during the wedding, but I know that my sister would be really upset if she couldn't be with her dog. I could also hire a pet sitter to watch the dog during the wedding, but that would be expensive.\n\nI'm still not sure what to do. I'm hoping that my sister will come around and understand my decision, but I'm not sure if she will.\n\nI'm also worried about how my guests will react. Some people might be allergic to dogs, and I don't want anyone to have an allergic reaction on my wedding day.\n\nI'm really stressed out about this, and I don't know what to do.

I have a friend with a service dog, and she\u2019s totally allowed!", "NTA\n\nBruh who the fuck demands to bring a dog to a wedding?\n\n> I'm really stressed out about this, and I don't know what to do. I just want my wedding day to be perfect, but I don't know how to make everyone happy.\n\nYou need to give up on that right now lol. It's impossible to make everyone happy. It's impossible to make your wedding perfect. If you strive for those things, you will just be disappointed with your wedding. Sit back, deal with the drama, and focus on making yourself happy for your big day.\n\nCongrats!", "NTA, and it sounds like she is being stubborn and unreasonable. It\u2019s really her responsibility to find a solution for her dog, so she can be there for you on your day. You\u2019ve already tried to help her find a solution, which is more than kind. \n\nWord of advice, your wedding day is for you and your husband. It\u2019s not your job to make everyone happy, and if your sister is going to let her dog stand on the way of her attending your wedding, she sounds the AH to me. It\u2019s not reasonable for guests to assume they can bring their dogs to weddings, even if it is your sister. She needs to stop being selfish on one of the biggest days of your life. Hopefully, she\u2019ll come around. Good luck.", "NTA - I can\u2019t actually believe this is real, and I am a dog lover. Most dogs wouldn\u2019t enjoy a wedding, most dog owners would know this and leave their dog at home. Maybe tell her you think it\u2019ll be really noisy and unpleasant and that you\u2019re considering doing fireworks or something which might upset the dog.\n\nIs the dog a service dog? I find it hard to believe she can\u2019t leave it for a little while.", "NTA\n\nYour wedding your choice. Majority of weddings have no dogs in them honestly also.\n\nIf you are happy maybe see if someone can look after them during the ceremony and if you are happy allow them to bring them to the reception. \n\nAgain its your decision and unless this dog is service dog which I expect is not the case your are completely entitled to ask they not be present.", "OMG, NTA. Even childfree weddings are still questioned (although I think it's a good option for some) and wr are at a point to call for a pet free wedding. I sympathize with you here but a wedding is not a place for a dog. I love my corgi and ferret but I would never subject them to smth rowdy and loud like a wedding. She needs to put her dog's well being as a priority and learn that taking her pet everywhere is not a necessity. \n\nStick to your guns", "Hey, my dog's my son, but even I know I can't bring my miggle everywhere.\n\nNTA. Would be nice of you to offer to arrange for accommodations for the pooch, but the sad truth is, being a dog owner means having restrictions (time or monetary) on what you can attend. It would be unfair to other guests, especially if not informed, if they showed up to your wedding only to see a dog there, as some people may be allergic/scared of dogs.", "NTA\n\nUnless the dog is a service dog, your sister knows it's not allowed everywhere. \n\nEven if friendly, the noise and amount of people may cause the dog to behave differently than normal, which would ruin things. \n\nIt's your wedding, so ultimately, you get to decide if you want it there or not. Just like people have child free weddings, you can have a pet free wedding if that's your choice. \n\nYour sister can then choose whether to come or not.", "NTA - I believe not many places allow pets, and if she's really concerned about the dog's wellbeing, she can hire a sitter.", "NTA. She\u2019s being completely unreasonable.", "NTA - not your responsibility to find a solution either, IF she hires a sitter it would be friendly to check whether there is a room at the venue that the sitter can use and perhaps share some lunch with this person. but not oblieged to do so...", "NTA. You set a boundary for your sister. You express concerns about the dog being a distraction or probably causing trouble (e.g. it could damage something or getting lost/injured), or some guests could be allergic to dogs. Dogs are like small children: they won't necessarily stay still or quiet. I think your sister needs to compromise. \nHave you talked about this issue to any other guest or family member (your family or your partner's?) It would be nice to also have an extra opinion from people you know.", "NTA \n\nIt's your big day, not your sister's. You don't need to cater to her dog's needs. I'm sure many people attending your wedding have dogs and are happy to leave them at home or with sitters.", "Is this a service dog? I don\u2019t mean ESA, I mean a trained service they perform.", "NTA. It is your wedding, not hers. If she can't be selfless for one day then she should stay home.", "NTA it your wedding your rule but you need to understand if your sister choose to not come to your wedding.", "Before I give my verdict, what\u2019s the reception and ceremonies policy on animals in these events? \n\nThere\u2019s a good chance they don\u2019t allow pets", "This is not an issue for me. My mum brought her dog to my wedding, and nothing happened, what could happen ?!\n\nAsk your sister to be ready to leave the room if the dog gets noisy or whatever, she just has to be responsible and that's all.", "Hey , no you are NTA. That being said, I think your sister only asked you because you are well her sister.  She obviously didn't ask it as a random person inviting her to their wedding. I myself have 2 small dogs (babies) . They are very cute and tiny but I haven't taken them to a wedding yet. I see many reels of people taking their dogs to family weddings and it is adorable. We may take them if it's a close ones event and the person and venue allows it. One of my aunt's daughters got married recently and she has a dog she loves to bits. But she couldn't take him to her own daughter's wedding because the venue didn't allow dogs on the property. While in other case, we went to my husband's friends wedding and there, the bride's uncle and aunt brought their mid sized dog along with them and he sat quietly with them \ud83d\ude00 and looked so cute. So , If it's a small dog, i would suggest you to be ok with it if the venue is pet friendly. Just ask your sister to make sure he is  in her lap or on leash always. I mean it is your wedding so you can say yes or no but it is your sister's dog and she may be very attached to him so it's her choice ultimately what she wants to do in case you are not ok with her bringing her doggo.", "This is not an issue for me.
