It's impossible to make your wedding perfect. If you strive for those things, you will just be disappointed with your wedding. Sit back, deal with the drama, and focus on making yourself happy for your big day.\n\nCongrats!", "NTA, and it sounds like she is being stubborn and unreasonable. It\u2019s really her responsibility to find a solution for her dog, so she can be there for you on your day. You\u2019ve already tried to help her find a solution, which is more than kind. \n\nWord of advice, your wedding day is for you and your husband. It\u2019s not your job to make everyone happy, and if your sister is going to let her dog stand on the way of her attending your wedding, she sounds the AH to me. It\u2019s not reasonable for guests to assume they can bring their dogs to weddings, even if it is your sister. She needs to stop being selfish on one of the biggest days of your life. Hopefully, she\u2019ll come around. Good luck.", "NTA - I can\u2019t actually believe this is real, and I am a dog lover.

Even childfree weddings are still questioned (although I think it's a good option for some) and wr are at a point to call for a pet free wedding. I sympathize with you here but a wedding is not a place for a dog. I love my corgi and ferret but I would never subject them to smth rowdy and loud like a wedding. She needs to put her dog's well being as a priority and learn that taking her pet everywhere is not a necessity. \n\nStick to your guns", "Hey, my dog's my son, but even I know I can't bring my miggle everywhere.\n\nNTA. Would be nice of you to offer to arrange for accommodations for the pooch, but the sad truth is, being a dog owner means having restrictions (time or monetary) on what you can attend. It would be unfair to other guests, especially if not informed, if they showed up to your wedding only to see a dog there, as some people may be allergic/scared of dogs.", "NTA\n\nUnless the dog is a service dog, your sister knows it's not allowed everywhere. \n\nEven if friendly, the noise and amount of people may cause the dog to behave differently than normal, which would ruin things. \n\nIt's your wedding, so ultimately, you get to decide if you want it there or not. Just like people have child free weddings, you can have a pet free wedding if that's your choice. \n\nYour sister can then choose whether to come or not.", "NTA - I believe not many places allow pets, and if she's really concerned about the dog's wellbeing, she can hire a sitter.", "NTA.

You set a boundary for your sister. You express concerns about the dog being a distraction or probably causing trouble (e.g. it could damage something or getting lost/injured), or some guests could be allergic to dogs. Dogs are like small children: they won't necessarily stay still or quiet. I think your sister needs to compromise. \nHave you talked about this issue to any other guest or family member (your family or your partner's?) It would be nice to also have an extra opinion from people you know.", "NTA \n\nIt's your big day, not your sister's. You don't need to cater to her dog's needs. I'm sure many people attending your wedding have dogs and are happy to leave them at home or with sitters.", "Is this a service dog? I don\u2019t mean ESA, I mean a trained service they perform.", "NTA. It is your wedding, not hers. If she can't be selfless for one day then she should stay home.", "NTA it your wedding your rule but you need to understand if your sister choose to not come to your wedding.", "Before I give my verdict, what\u2019s the reception and ceremonies policy on animals in these events? \n\nThere\u2019s a good chance they don\u2019t allow pets", "This is not an issue for me. My mum brought her dog to my wedding, and nothing happened, what could happen ?!\n\nAsk your sister to be ready to leave the room if the dog gets noisy or whatever, she just has to be responsible and that's all.", "Hey , no you are NTA. That being said, I think your sister only asked you because you are well her sister.  She obviously didn't ask it as a random person inviting her to their wedding. I myself have 2 small dogs (babies) . They are very cute and tiny but I haven't taken them to a wedding yet. I see many reels of people taking their dogs to family weddings and it is adorable. We may take them if it's a close ones event and the person and venue allows it. One of my aunt's daughters got married recently and she has a dog she loves to bits. But she couldn't take him to her own daughter's wedding because the venue didn't allow dogs on the property. While in other case, we went to my husband's friends wedding and there, the bride's uncle and aunt brought their mid sized dog along with them and he sat quietly with them \ud83d\ude00 and looked so cute. So , If it's a small dog, i would suggest you to be ok with it if the venue is pet friendly. Just ask your sister to make sure he is  in her lap or on leash always. I mean it is your wedding so you can say yes or no but it is your sister's dog and she may be very attached to him so it's her choice ultimately what she wants to do in case you are not ok with her bringing her doggo.", "This is not an issue for me.

If she chooses no to come its her choice and you can see how much she cares for you\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all congratulations on your big day! onward;\n\nYour wedding, your rules.\n\nIt's not a service animal and your sister is massively overreacting in my opinion.\n\nBut i stress you should be firm and stick to your boundaries, your worries have merit.", "NTA your sister needs to grow up. If she can't separate herself from her dog for a day then she had serious issues.", "Unless it's an assistance dog (which it doesn't seem to be!), then no, NTA.", "NTA. And by saying she can't come to the wedding without her dog, she's trying to hold you hostage. Stop trying to meet her in the middle, tell her you understand if she can't come to the wedding because of the dog and that's unfortunate but ok. Then let her decide whether or not she wants to miss such a special and important day to  avoid being apart from her dog for a few hours. And you can focus on more important things", "NTA. Unless the dog belongs to the happy couple and is rigged out with a bow tie and a cushion to carry the rings, only service dogs should be allowed. \n\nI love my dogs, would probably make them bridesmaid and best man, but I'd never take them to someone else's wedding. That's weird.", "NTA. People need to understand you don\u2019t need to bring your dog literally everywhere you go", "NTA. Dogs are not invited to weddings. That dig is not your \"niece.\" Period. Your sister is out of her mind. If she chooses to sit home with her dog rather than attend your WEDDING, she is the AH.", "NTA\n\nYou are entitled to decide on the guest list and that includes people's pets.\n\nHOWEVER, if it is a service animal (but it doesn't sound like it is from how you refer to it), that's another story\n\nSister can get a dog sitter or if she wants to guilt trip/ force you by saying she can't come you can just reply \"sorry you can't make it, you will be with us in spirit\"", "Nta. Let her stay at jome with her dog \u2026", "NTA. Tell your sister she can't bring the dog. Don't compromise. You can present your argument about how you're concerned about possible allergic reactions to the dog & how it'll draw attention away from the wedding. The wedding is about you & your fiance. If she makes a fuss, withdraw her invite. If she tries bringing the dog anyway, kick her out.", "NTA- I LOVE dogs (yet just have a cat) and interacting with dogs but there are some situations where a dog\u2019s presence is inappropriate, for example a WEDDING. Your sister needs to find other arrangements for her dog that day. I hate to sound nosy but I feel like your parents should help you out in this situation and tell her no dog.", "NTA. It is really unreasonable to bring her dog. If you\u2019re paying for a venue, it\u2019s highly unlikely they\u2019ll even let a dog on the premises. Dogs can stay a long time by themselves, like 8+ hours. I\u2019m really concerned that your sister can\u2019t seem to go places without her dog. Is she okay?", "NTA and the only time I would\u2019ve said differently is if it was a service dog, but it\u2019s not. \n\nI say this as a pet owner who love my cat more than anything in this world, your sister needs to learn to be away from her dog. There will be more situations in life when bringing her dog is not an option so she either needs to learn to deal with that, or accept the fact that she\u2019ll probably miss out on more events in the future.", "I love my dog (my dog was at my wedding) but I would never dream of asking if my dog could attend someone else\u2019s wedding. NTA", "NTA \n\nJust tel her you asked the venue and unless it\u2019s a service animal, no animals allowed. \n\nAlso, really. Brides have soooooo many things to worry about, this is unnecessary. It\u2019s a dog, it will be okay for one day.", "NTA why can't she be a few hours without her dog fpr her sisters wedding exactly?", "What?! NTA.", "NTA. Its an fn dog. And I say this as a dog owner. Its a wedding. And its an FN DOG. If she truly is going to miss her sisters wedding because a DOG ISNT INVITED???", "I love my dog so much! The kids are grown and out, so he's my baby.\n\nThat said, I would NEVER bring him to a wedding, funeral, movie, nail appointment, or the hair dresser's.\n\n Just because I think the sun rises and sets on him doesn't mean that friends and family do.", "NTA. Tell your sister no and if she says she can't come, tell her she will be missed and move on. Don't feed into her drama. Yes, pets are family, but pets are not invited to all the events humans are. If she chooses to get sitter or leave the dog at home, tell her a friend is bringing a service dog and deal with her meltdown then. \n\nWhat I see happening is either she shows up with the dog anyway or makes a scene when she see the service dog.", "NTA.  It isn't a service dog, and the wedding isn't about your sister.  If she doesn't come, she's just an asshole.", "NTA. She can leave the dog home. If she\u2019s really worried about it, she could see if a trusted friend could watch the pup for her so they aren\u2019t alone. If in proximity to her home, she could go between the wedding and reception to see the pup for a bit, given if there\u2019s time too. She doesn\u2019t have to stay to the end of the reception either. \n\nBe ready though to hear more complaints from your sister when she sees your friend with their service dog. It\u2019s frustrating how people don\u2019t realize emotional support animals are not the same as service dogs. I get they help the owner, but are not the same. Service dogs have a ridiculous amount of training to behave and help their owner.", "Yeah your sister is being nuts. Dogs aren\u2019t people and unless they\u2019re a service dog, they don\u2019t belong at a wedding. NTA", "Wouldn't your sister's dog distract your friend's service pup and potentially endanger your friend?", "I'm a dog owner, I know a person who is like that. Even pre-covid she wouldn't go into a store unless she could take the dog with her, only goes to restaurants that have dog friendly outdoor seating, works for a place she can take her dog every day. It's a codependency.", " Majority? Like 99.9% of them \u2764\ufe0f", "Why should OP arrange for accommodations for a dog that isnt hers? If this were a child free wedding, would she be responsible for finding babysitters for all the parents??? Fuck no. Her sister needs to grow up and take like the literal MINIMUM amount of responsibility here", "I hope you meant to say legitimate Trained Service Animal.  Any pet can be an official ESA, you literally just need a signed piece of paper from a doc or therapist that says it is.  They don't even have to meet the animal to sign that paper and no training is involved.  The whole thing is a joke.  ESAs began so people could keep pets in government housing and its spiraled completely out of control.  I wish they'd just ban the whole thing.  I also with that Service Animals had an official type training and certification through the government so we could all be on the same page about them and not have people throwing fits about their \"service animal\" getting kicked out of a restaurant after they peed everywhere.", "Exactly tell the sister as someone is bringing a service dog her dog cannot come as it will distract the service dog and you\u2019d rather avoid medical emergencies or dog fights", "Quite a lot of service dogs are hypoallergenic breeds, to avoid issues like these. And they won't interact with others as much as a pet dog as they are trained to do their job, not play with others, so that lowers the risk."]}
