{"id": 5811, "submission_id": "zwscb1", "title": "AITA for telling my husband the reason he went NC with his parents is silly?", "selftext": "I (27F) have been married to my husband (27M) for 5 years, together for 6 years. We met in college when we were 21 and dated for 8 months before he asked me to marry him and I said yes. Four months later we were married, on our one year dating anniversary. \n\nI have never met his parents. For the first 6 months of our relationship he would talk about them all the time, how they were great parents, how I was going to love them, they were going to love me, and all of that. And then, all of sudden, he told me he wasn\u2019t on speaking terms with them anymore! I was very confused at the time and tried to get him to talk about it but no such luck. He just told me they had a fight, it wasn\u2019t something he could forgive and that was that. \n\nI met most of his family at the wedding or during the preparations for it. I truly adore them. \n\nWe were spending Christmas with his paternal grandparents (his parents were with his mother's parents, I think) when his cousin accidentally let slip why my husband fought with his parents: he told them he wanted to marry me and they accused me of being a gold digger (with more polite wording). Husband has confirmed this. \n\nHusband\u2019s family does have a lot of money, the generational kind of wealth. And we did the whole meeting - getting engaged - getting married quite quickly to be fair to his parents! But the thing is: my family has more money than his family! And hubby knew it too! I would be a less than stellar gold digger if that was my intent.  \n\nSo upon learning what happened I thought it was amusing. Never in my life have I been accused of trying to social climb lol. Maybe if I had known at the time I would have been offended? But today I just find it funny. \n\nI told my husband he should contact his parents and try to mend their relationship. They were just worried for his sake. While I\u2019m truly grateful he stuck by me and defended me so strongly, there is no need for that anymore. \n\nHe didn\u2019t want to hear it. At this point I was a little bit exasperated. His parents were worried and had no way to know better. I told him that and said it\u2019s silly to stay NC with them after all this time for such a small offence. My honour has already recovered from learning what they said.\n\nWell, he was upset about that last bit, saying it\u2019s silly. Things have gotten back to normal since we last talked about it (yesterday morning). But I\u2019m wondering: AITA? Should I apologise? I just think it makes no sense to throw away such a great parental relationship for something about me that I\u2019m not even bothered with!", "created_utc": 1672180332, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwscb1/aita_for_telling_my_husband_the_reason_he_went_nc/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know with the distance of time, it doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal to you, but you\u2019re forgetting a few things:\n\n1) He still hasn\u2019t told you the whole story. People don\u2019t cut off their parents for years because of one little remark. They cut off their parents because that remark was *the last straw*. There\u2019s more to this.\n\n2) Once a relationship has been ripped apart, it matters how it is repaired. It has become clear to your husband that his parents didn\u2019t spend 6 years fighting for him. They barely cared he was gone at all (presumably). That sends a message, a creates a wound deeper than the original rip. His parents fucked up the healing stage and let your husband know exactly how important he is to them (not at all).\n\nI think you should apologize for minimizing his experience, and say that from now on, however he wants to manage his parents, you\u2019re on his side.", "Well here's a question for you... if you *didn't* come from wealth and they'd treated you as a gold digger do you actually think that you'd be laughing this off as no big deal? \n\nYou also either don't know exactly what exchange occurred or you're not sharing it with us here. Was it really just a reasonable and minor concern or were they actually quite rude about it?\n\nAt the end of the day, whatever happened was enough that a guy who previously had a close relationship with his parents decided he wanted to go no contact. This generally isn't a decision made lightly--is your husband the sort of person who cuts people off willy nilly?\n\nSo yeah, YTA for telling him it's \"silly\" and a \"small offense\". Clearly it wasn't, to him.", "YTA. It's not silly to him. Also, you don't know what was said to him or how it was said. He knows how he feels.", "YTA. It sounds like your husband stood up for you when his family were accusing you of marrying him for money. He's clearly chosen being with you over his family and it looks as if his he's kept a lot of what his family said hidden from you to protect you.", "Oh hell, yes, YTA.\nI can guarantee that calling you a gold digger was the kindest word they used.\n\nHe decided to choose you. You have no idea what was said, and you don't get to decide when he's had enough of their shit and cuts them out. Nor do you have the full details of why this put him over the edge. Don't ever tell someone who put up healthy boundaries and has a non-existent relationship with someone who bashes you that their reason is silly. He chose to protect you from them. That's pretty fucking noble. \n\nYou owe him an apology. \n\nMy IL's are almost NC because of their bad behaviour and dislike of me. My hubs speaks to them maybe 1x a month. They decided to bad mouth me, never to my face, but to everyone else on the planet, including random strangers.  Bad behaviour has consequences. They are reaping the rewards of their choices.", "YTA.\n\nThere's a *range* of calling your son's fiancee a gold digger, and large sections of that range have nothing to do with genuine concern for his well-being. You have a secondhand report of the conversation, that you are trying to trust more than the impressions of a person who was actually in it.\n\nI'm so glad you're unbothered by what you were told, but your husband's relationship with his parents is his to manage.", "YTA. despite the fact that their comment was about you, your husband has every right to form his own opinion about what they said and act on it. his opinion is not \u201csilly\u201d, especially since it\u2019s based in defending your relationship.", "YTA \nYou completely dismissed his feelings, he has a right to feel the way he feels. There could also be more to the story.", "Going with YTA.\n\nYou're not bothered by it but your husband was. Let's say that you were not from an affluent family. It doesn't change the fact that your in laws made an unfair pre-judgement on someone they barely knew (obviously).  I think that's what bothered your husband who sounds like he's got a good head on his shoulder.", "YTA.  I think your intentions were good, but I can pretty much guarantee there is more going on here and a lot more history that lead up to his decision to go no contact.  I would just say to him \"It is up to you how to navigate your relationship with your parents.  I just want you to know that I will fully support you if you do ever want a relationship.  I know they really hurt you by what they said about me, but I am not upset and I won't hold it against them if you do choose to ever reach out.  I am behind you whatever you want to do.\"", "INFO: Have you considered how you would feel now if you weren't from a family with more money than his? \n\nBecause of your family background, you find the suggestion amusing, but your husband reacted differently and I don't think its silly.", "It's not okay for you to minimize and dismiss his feelings. This didn't just affect you; they insulted his judgment too. YTA", "YTA\n\nThere is a whole sub-reddit that wishes their SO had the balls yours has, he feels strongly about this for reasons of his own, its his parents, his relationship, his business, let him decide if and when to break NC. They made a judgement about you without knowing you or your family, that is a huge JustNo thing to do, they need to apologize to both you and your son, when he allows it.", "YTA.  Let him manage his own relationship with his parents.", "YTA. His relationship with them is his to manage. You need to stay far out of this one and let him do as we wishes. \n\nAnd I bet more was said and done but he kept it to himself to protect you. Don\u2019t go stirring up drama.", "YTA\n\nNo one goes full NC out of the blue. This is likely the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. Of COURSE his family is \u201camazing\u201d when you two got together. He loves you and didn\u2019t want to scare you off. \n\nBut to have them come in hot when they assume they\u2019re wealthier and therefore \u201cbetter\u201d than you (super gross btw), say likely incredibly nasty things about you -that he no doubt didn\u2019t share- and HE MADE THAT THE HILL TO DIE ON only for you to now brush it off like it wasn\u2019t a huge emotional toll for him? \n\nIt\u2019s an ugly look.", "YTA for telling him his reasons were silly. You don\u2019t get to judge other people for how deeply they are hurt by what someone else does or says. I think it\u2019s likely that he was deeply offended that they would think he was that gullible or stupid. But it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014his relationship with his family is HIS business and never yours, unless they are mistreating you.", "YTA, but I think your problem is:\n\n1) You grew up sheltered and have never seen truly toxic relationships in families\n2) Your lack of experience is belied by your lack of imagination\n3) I don't think you realize how damaging the gaslighting you're engaging in is doing to your partner and your relationship with him\n\nI really think you need to do some research on toxic relationships and make amends soon before your husband wonders if his relationship with you is a continuation of a bad cycle he saw growing up and already chose to walk away from.", "YTA. Apologize. Your husband did what he believed was best to stand up for you and how strongly he felt for you, calling that silly. Apologize, and mean it for the right reasons.", "YTA, but you meant well, so I'm only saying YTA because the subreddit has rules.  A few things to consider:  1.  Maybe they were really assholes about how they said it, in which case, the fact that you're rich doesn't make them less assholish.  2.  If they were not assholes about how they said it, then your husband likely was really ready, even eager, to go NC with them.  IN that case, he's got another reason, which perhaps you still don't know about.  3.  If he had no other reason, and they're weren't assholes about they said it, and he just over-reacted to a minor attack on your character... then he just lost six years of his relationship with his parents because he was strenuously defending you.  The last thing in the world someone who has made a sacrifice like that wants to hear is that you think it was \"silly.\"    \n\n\nIf he wasn't already on the verge of going NC, what he did must have been painful for him, and calling it silly kind of makes it sound like you don't even appreciate the price he paid.  That doesn't mean you can't suggest it's time to attempt reconciliation, but don't belittle or devalue what he did.", "YTA, but as someone else said, lightly. It\u2019s nice of you to want your husband to repair things with his family, but I\u2019d kill for my husband to take up for me the way yours did. \n\nHowever, it is a little odd that your husband didn\u2019t tell you for 5 years why he went NC with his parents\u2026I feel like there\u2019s also more to the story that he\u2019s not telling you, which is also strange.", "YTA. Assuming things always makes YTA.  No matter how much you ever learn about your husband and his family, you\u2019ll never understand it like he does since you didn\u2019t live it", "YTA. You don't know how the actual conversation went down. Consider apologizing and saying that was absolutely the wrong word choice. Then LET IT GO and see if he comes around on his own.", "YTA. He doesn't want to go back into contact with them. Stop trying to convince him to do it. He seems to be fine without his parents in his life and that should be very telling.", "YTA\n\nDifferent people respond to the same thing differently. While you think his reaction is extreme, his behavior shows that he thinks he is justified.", "YTA. Why do you think his parental relationship is so great, when he's telling you it isn't? You've kinda been a jerk to him and invalidated him when it sounds like the reason he went NC with his parents was YOU!", "WHY do you think he should reconnect with his parents?  Because you find it amusing that your family has more money than his and think  his reason for going NC is nonsense?  His reason probably really has nothing to do with YOU but their remarks about you were most likely the final straw in a lot of things that don't revolve around you and your condescending attitude.  You're giving yourself way too much importance here.  YTA.", "NAH. Amusing story though.", "NAH\n\nYou should have had more tact, but it doesn't make you an AH, your point is solid.\n\nHim going NC was probably less about you being a gold digger being true, but more about the accusation. He stood up for you in a way most wouldn't. He did nothing wrong here, but I question if it's worth losing your family over, particularly if you would prefer the family connections and time over the NC because of the insult.\n\nParents are some form of AHs. However we have no knowledge on exactly what they said and how they said it. They obviously didn't know enough about you, but there's a difference between saying watch out as you may be just after his money and yelling at him that you are and trying to put a wedge in your relationship.", "NAH, but as stated by other comments the way you talked about it was perhaps a bit insensitive.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily believe the cousin saying there's nothing more to it either - unless they were very, very close (brothers, or something like that).\n\nIn any case, I think it's also interesting to figure out why it bothers you. It might just be a question of finding it 'silly' to lose family over this, but I know if I were you I'd feel bad for being part of the reason and I'd _want_ them to get over it. I'm not you, but my point is this: make sure you understand how _you_ feel about it and include that in the conversation. Not as the main driver, just to make sure he can understand why you care about this.\n\nAs pointed out by others, instead of asking him to forget and forgive, I'd try to open the dialogue by simply stating to you don't understand and that you'd like to - without attaching any advice to the outcome of that conversation.\n\nHear him out, have him hear you out too and start from there if you can manage that with care and love.", "NAH", "NTA\n\nYou're very sensible and calm. It's awesome. Now you've said that, though, you need to let him make his mind up.", "Personally I'd be pretty concerned about 1) a guy who wouldn't let me meet his parents and wouldn't explain why they are estranged; and 2) a guy who so easily cuts off his family over something so minor.\n\nBut you're OK with both points, so just drop it---like he has. NAH I guess.", "NTA\n\nIt's good that he stood up for you, but to go no contact? That's pretty extreme.\n\n Doesn't it make you worry that if you have an argument with him sometime he will go no contact with you?", "NTA. \n\nThough there may be more to the NC than your husband is letting on.  \n\nAnyway, I don't think it's wrong to remind someone in a friendly way that their relationship with their family is important.  \n\nParents don't live forever, and maybe you're concerned he might regret ending his relationship with them someday and want to spare him that pain?\n\nIf he's not okay with you meddling, though, you should respect that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s also pretty shitty to minimise and dismiss your partners feelings about his parents.\n\nFrom the information you provided it sounds like that incident was a catalyst for your partner to review and recontextualise his relationship with his parents in general, he made the decision he was better off without them. Even if his relationship with you was the catalyst, none of this is about you. \n\nYou don\u2019t know his parents, you don\u2019t know what was said at the time and you don\u2019t have the context, so you dismissing him and questioning his judgment (just like his parents apparently did) is a really awful thing to do. \n\nYou need to apologise.", "Yta. You don\u2019t know how the exchange went and honestly knowing better would be not making those accusations at all. These people never met you and assumed off the bat you were after money. Your husband defends you and sets boundaries with clearly toxic people. He knows his parents better than you do; I don\u2019t feel  you understand the reality of the situation. Kudos to you for having someone who has your back.", "YTA stay out of his relationship with his family. That isn't your place and to not respect his feelings on this are also inappropriate.", "YTA", "NAH. But you could have been more tactful. It's really great that he takes your honor so seriously, but his duty to you has been done. You understandably don't want him to alienate his family over this. Is it possible that there's a little more to his reaction? Have his parents done or said similar things about his past girlfriends? Talk to him about it and be open to his answer. He might need some time to forgive his parents. Hear him out and let him know that you always stand behind him.", "NTA.  I don\u2019t think it deserves an apology, but maybe another discussion where you can ask if there\u2019s something more going on and gently suggest that it might be nice to get back in contact with them, especially if there are going to be grandkids.", "YTA for the silly comment but the rest is more nuanced than the reactionaries on this thread are making it out to be.  INFO: Is your husband someone prone to black-and white thinking, snap judgements, and holding grudges?  Because if that's the case you might be right but you should know the chances he will eventually decide you are also The Enemy are pretty high.  If he's generally a reasonable person, then it's possible you haven't heard the whole story, or that he didn't come to terms with the other ways his parents were controlling or unable to back down until it was directed toward someone else. I mean, I would have described what a \"hero\" my mom was before I came to terms with her emotional abuse in college. Regardless, I would apologize for the silly comment and walk back your position  to \"I would have no objection to you rekindling your relationship.\"  I would then leave space for him to confide in you what actually happened, but i wouldnt demand it.  You've said your piece, you've conveyed that the speed of your relationship was enough that its natural for parental eyebrows to be raised, the rest just isn't your decision to make.", "Part of it could be that his parents did not respect, listen to him and his opinion regarding his then fiance. It wasn't just a slight against her, it was a stab at his judgement as well.", "This needs to be the top comment. On point and very well said.", "Yeah, I have a feeling this was just the final straw, probably in a long history of them not respecting his choices/opinions.", "Well, no. I guess I would probably feel different but I still think their worry would have been warranted. He was telling his parents he wanted to marry a girl he had been dating for only six months and that they had never met! \n\nMy parents weren\u2019t particularly ecstatic either. They never said anything about money but they did ask why not wait a bit longer. I made it clear that this kind of talk would not be tolerated and they moved on. They love my husband now, more than they love me I think sometimes!", "Maybe there's more context/background to the NC. She married her husband, not his parents. She should trust him and take her cues about his parents from him.", "I don\u2019t think there is more to it. After his cousin let it slip (she thought I already knew) we talked about it. They were emphatic about it but it was just that. I asked if there was more and he said no. I don\u2019t think he would have lied, specially since he could just have said there was but he didn\u2019t want to talk about it. I would have respected as I have before.", "YTA Heres the thing though. I\u2019m guessing he has more than just this reason as why he went NC. Both my partner and I are Nc with our mothers. Even after almost 13 years together he still won\u2019t ever know or understand everything my mom did to me. He just saw me finally break after she forgot my birthday a few years back. At surface level that seems like the dumbest reason for not speaking to a parent but it was just the last straw. It\u2019s the same with him. The final straw wouldn\u2019t be that serious in its own but with the history he has with her it all makes sense. You don\u2019t know his full relationship with his parents and you may never fully know or understand. Because of that you should leave how he handles that relationship to him. It could be as simple as them criticizing you or or it could be so much trauma he may never even want to speak about it. Whatever it was it was enough for him to drop his parents completely. Children don\u2019t do this lightly. I speak from experience. Please apologize to him and let him know you\u2019ll leave matters of his parents to him and respect his opinion.", "Ok so question: you made it clear to your parents that it wouldn\u2019t be tolerated and they respected your decision so how about that he said the same thing to his parents and they simply couldn\u2019t respect his\u2026thus the whole NC with his parents \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThere is a reason he doesn\u2019t talk to them and you realllly should respect that, he will tell you but in his own time and on his own terms\u2026so don\u2019t push it or you both lose, you know?", "Respect it right now and let him be. He is the one who makes the decisions on how to deal with his parents. And please DON'T try to contact them without him knowing to force contact with them (I say this as I stare at some reddit posts)", "Then stay out of it. He'll forgive his family when he's ready if that's what he wants to do."]}
