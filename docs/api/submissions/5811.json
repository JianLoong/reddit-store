{"id": 5811, "submission_id": "zwscb1", "title": "AITA for telling my husband the reason he went NC with his parents is silly?", "selftext": "I (27F) have been married to my husband (27M) for 5 years, together for 6 years. We met in college when we were 21 and dated for 8 months before he asked me to marry him and I said yes. Four months later we were married, on our one year dating anniversary. \n\nI have never met his parents. For the first 6 months of our relationship he would talk about them all the time, how they were great parents, how I was going to love them, they were going to love me, and all of that. And then, all of sudden, he told me he wasn\u2019t on speaking terms with them anymore! I was very confused at the time and tried to get him to talk about it but no such luck. He just told me they had a fight, it wasn\u2019t something he could forgive and that was that. \n\nI met most of his family at the wedding or during the preparations for it. I truly adore them. \n\nWe were spending Christmas with his paternal grandparents (his parents were with his mother's parents, I think) when his cousin accidentally let slip why my husband fought with his parents: he told them he wanted to marry me and they accused me of being a gold digger (with more polite wording). Husband has confirmed this. \n\nHusband\u2019s family does have a lot of money, the generational kind of wealth. And we did the whole meeting - getting engaged - getting married quite quickly to be fair to his parents! But the thing is: my family has more money than his family! And hubby knew it too! I would be a less than stellar gold digger if that was my intent.  \n\nSo upon learning what happened I thought it was amusing. Never in my life have I been accused of trying to social climb lol. Maybe if I had known at the time I would have been offended? But today I just find it funny. \n\nI told my husband he should contact his parents and try to mend their relationship. They were just worried for his sake. While I\u2019m truly grateful he stuck by me and defended me so strongly, there is no need for that anymore. \n\nHe didn\u2019t want to hear it. At this point I was a little bit exasperated. His parents were worried and had no way to know better. I told him that and said it\u2019s silly to stay NC with them after all this time for such a small offence. My honour has already recovered from learning what they said.\n\nWell, he was upset about that last bit, saying it\u2019s silly. Things have gotten back to normal since we last talked about it (yesterday morning). But I\u2019m wondering: AITA? Should I apologise? I just think it makes no sense to throw away such a great parental relationship for something about me that I\u2019m not even bothered with!", "created_utc": 1672180332, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwscb1/aita_for_telling_my_husband_the_reason_he_went_nc/", "score": 433, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know with the distance of time, it doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal to you, but you\u2019re forgetting a few things:\n\n1) He still hasn\u2019t told you the whole story. People don\u2019t cut off their parents for years because of one little remark. They cut off their parents because that remark was *the last straw*. There\u2019s more to this.\n\n2) Once a relationship has been ripped apart, it matters how it is repaired. It has become clear to your husband that his parents didn\u2019t spend 6 years fighting for him. They barely cared he was gone at all (presumably). That sends a message, a creates a wound deeper than the original rip. His parents fucked up the healing stage and let your husband know exactly how important he is to them (not at all).\n\nI think you should apologize for minimizing his experience, and say that from now on, however he wants to manage his parents, you\u2019re on his side.", "Well here's a question for you... if you *didn't* come from wealth and they'd treated you as a gold digger do you actually think that you'd be laughing this off as no big deal? \n\nYou also either don't know exactly what exchange occurred or you're not sharing it with us here. Was it really just a reasonable and minor concern or were they actually quite rude about it?\n\nAt the end of the day, whatever happened was enough that a guy who previously had a close relationship with his parents decided he wanted to go no contact. This generally isn't a decision made lightly--is your husband the sort of person who cuts people off willy nilly?\n\nSo yeah, YTA for telling him it's \"silly\" and a \"small offense\". Clearly it wasn't, to him.", "YTA. It's not silly to him. Also, you don't know what was said to him or how it was said. He knows how he feels.", "YTA. It sounds like your husband stood up for you when his family were accusing you of marrying him for money. He's clearly chosen being with you over his family and it looks as if his he's kept a lot of what his family said hidden from you to protect you.", "Oh hell, yes, YTA.\nI can guarantee that calling you a gold digger was the kindest word they used.\n\nHe decided to choose you. You have no idea what was said, and you don't get to decide when he's had enough of their shit and cuts them out. Nor do you have the full details of why this put him over the edge. Don't ever tell someone who put up healthy boundaries and has a non-existent relationship with someone who bashes you that their reason is silly. He chose to protect you from them. That's pretty fucking noble. \n\nYou owe him an apology. \n\nMy IL's are almost NC because of their bad behaviour and dislike of me. My hubs speaks to them maybe 1x a month. They decided to bad mouth me, never to my face, but to everyone else on the planet, including random strangers.  Bad behaviour has consequences. They are reaping the rewards of their choices.", "YTA.\n\nThere's a *range* of calling your son's fiancee a gold digger, and large sections of that range have nothing to do with genuine concern for his well-being. You have a secondhand report of the conversation, that you are trying to trust more than the impressions of a person who was actually in it.\n\nI'm so glad you're unbothered by what you were told, but your husband's relationship with his parents is his to manage.", "YTA. despite the fact that their comment was about you, your husband has every right to form his own opinion about what they said and act on it. his opinion is not \u201csilly\u201d, especially since it\u2019s based in defending your relationship.", "YTA \nYou completely dismissed his feelings, he has a right to feel the way he feels. There could also be more to the story.", "Going with YTA.\n\nYou're not bothered by it but your husband was. Let's say that you were not from an affluent family. It doesn't change the fact that your in laws made an unfair pre-judgement on someone they barely knew (obviously).  I think that's what bothered your husband who sounds like he's got a good head on his shoulder.", "YTA.  I think your intentions were good, but I can pretty much guarantee there is more going on here and a lot more history that lead up to his decision to go no contact.  I would just say to him \"It is up to you how to navigate your relationship with your parents.  I just want you to know that I will fully support you if you do ever want a relationship.  I know they really hurt you by what they said about me, but I am not upset and I won't hold it against them if you do choose to ever reach out.  I am behind you whatever you want to do.\"", "INFO: Have you considered how you would feel now if you weren't from a family with more money than his? \n\nBecause of your family background, you find the suggestion amusing, but your husband reacted differently and I don't think its silly.", "It's not okay for you to minimize and dismiss his feelings. This didn't just affect you; they insulted his judgment too. YTA", "YTA\n\nThere is a whole sub-reddit that wishes their SO had the balls yours has, he feels strongly about this for reasons of his own, its his parents, his relationship, his business, let him decide if and when to break NC. They made a judgement about you without knowing you or your family, that is a huge JustNo thing to do, they need to apologize to both you and your son, when he allows it.", "YTA.  Let him manage his own relationship with his parents.", "YTA. His relationship with them is his to manage. You need to stay far out of this one and let him do as we wishes. \n\nAnd I bet more was said and done but he kept it to himself to protect you. Don\u2019t go stirring up drama.", "YTA\n\nNo one goes full NC out of the blue. This is likely the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. Of COURSE his family is \u201camazing\u201d when you two got together. He loves you and didn\u2019t want to scare you off. \n\nBut to have them come in hot when they assume they\u2019re wealthier and therefore \u201cbetter\u201d than you (super gross btw), say likely incredibly nasty things about you -that he no doubt didn\u2019t share- and HE MADE THAT THE HILL TO DIE ON only for you to now brush it off like it wasn\u2019t a huge emotional toll for him? \n\nIt\u2019s an ugly look.", "YTA for telling him his reasons were silly. You don\u2019t get to judge other people for how deeply they are hurt by what someone else does or says. I think it\u2019s likely that he was deeply offended that they would think he was that gullible or stupid. But it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014his relationship with his family is HIS business and never yours, unless they are mistreating you.", "YTA, but I think your problem is:\n\n1) You grew up sheltered and have never seen truly toxic relationships in families\n2) Your lack of experience is belied by your lack of imagination\n3) I don't think you realize how damaging the gaslighting you're engaging in is doing to your partner and your relationship with him\n\nI really think you need to do some research on toxic relationships and make amends soon before your husband wonders if his relationship with you is a continuation of a bad cycle he saw growing up and already chose to walk away from.", "YTA. Apologize. Your husband did what he believed was best to stand up for you and how strongly he felt for you, calling that silly. Apologize, and mean it for the right reasons.", "YTA, but you meant well, so I'm only saying YTA because the subreddit has rules.  A few things to consider:  1.  Maybe they were really assholes about how they said it, in which case, the fact that you're rich doesn't make them less assholish.  2.  If they were not assholes about how they said it, then your husband likely was really ready, even eager, to go NC with them.  IN that case, he's got another reason, which perhaps you still don't know about.  3.  If he had no other reason, and they're weren't assholes about they said it, and he just over-reacted to a minor attack on your character... then he just lost six years of his relationship with his parents because he was strenuously defending you.  The last thing in the world someone who has made a sacrifice like that wants to hear is that you think it was \"silly.\"    \n\n\nIf he wasn't already on the verge of going NC, what he did must have been painful for him, and calling it silly kind of makes it sound like you don't even appreciate the price he paid.  That doesn't mean you can't suggest it's time to attempt reconciliation, but don't belittle or devalue what he did.", "YTA, but as someone else said, lightly. It\u2019s nice of you to want your husband to repair things with his family, but I\u2019d kill for my husband to take up for me the way yours did. \n\nHowever, it is a little odd that your husband didn\u2019t tell you for 5 years why he went NC with his parents\u2026I feel like there\u2019s also more to the story that he\u2019s not telling you, which is also strange.", "YTA. Assuming things always makes YTA.  No matter how much you ever learn about your husband and his family, you\u2019ll never understand it like he does since you didn\u2019t live it", "YTA. You don't know how the actual conversation went down. Consider apologizing and saying that was absolutely the wrong word choice. Then LET IT GO and see if he comes around on his own.", "YTA. He doesn't want to go back into contact with them. Stop trying to convince him to do it. He seems to be fine without his parents in his life and that should be very telling.", "YTA\n\nDifferent people respond to the same thing differently. While you think his reaction is extreme, his behavior shows that he thinks he is justified.", "YTA. Why do you think his parental relationship is so great, when he's telling you it isn't? You've kinda been a jerk to him and invalidated him when it sounds like the reason he went NC with his parents was YOU!", "WHY do you think he should reconnect with his parents?  Because you find it amusing that your family has more money than his and think  his reason for going NC is nonsense?  His reason probably really has nothing to do with YOU but their remarks about you were most likely the final straw in a lot of things that don't revolve around you and your condescending attitude.  You're giving yourself way too much importance here.  YTA.", "NAH. Amusing story though.", "NAH\n\nYou should have had more tact, but it doesn't make you an AH, your point is solid.\n\nHim going NC was probably less about you being a gold digger being true, but more about the accusation. He stood up for you in a way most wouldn't. He did nothing wrong here, but I question if it's worth losing your family over, particularly if you would prefer the family connections and time over the NC because of the insult.\n\nParents are some form of AHs. However we have no knowledge on exactly what they said and how they said it. They obviously didn't know enough about you, but there's a difference between saying watch out as you may be just after his money and yelling at him that you are and trying to put a wedge in your relationship.", "NAH, but as stated by other comments the way you talked about it was perhaps a bit insensitive.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily believe the cousin saying there's nothing more to it either - unless they were very, very close (brothers, or something like that).\n\nIn any case, I think it's also interesting to figure out why it bothers you. It might just be a question of finding it 'silly' to lose family over this, but I know if I were you I'd feel bad for being part of the reason and I'd _want_ them to get over it. I'm not you, but my point is this: make sure you understand how _you_ feel about it and include that in the conversation. Not as the main driver, just to make sure he can understand why you care about this.\n\nAs pointed out by others, instead of asking him to forget and forgive, I'd try to open the dialogue by simply stating to you don't understand and that you'd like to - without attaching any advice to the outcome of that conversation.\n\nHear him out, have him hear you out too and start from there if you can manage that with care and love.", "NAH", "NTA\n\nYou're very sensible and calm. It's awesome. Now you've said that, though, you need to let him make his mind up.", "Personally I'd be pretty concerned about 1) a guy who wouldn't let me meet his parents and wouldn't explain why they are estranged; and 2) a guy who so easily cuts off his family over something so minor.\n\nBut you've been OK with both points, so just drop it---like he has. NAH I guess.", "NTA\n\nIt's good that he stood up for you, but to go no contact? That's pretty extreme.\n\n Doesn't it make you worry that if you have an argument with him sometime he will go no contact with you?", "NTA. \n\nThough there may be more to the NC than your husband is letting on.  \n\nAnyway, I don't think it's wrong to remind someone in a friendly way that their relationship with their family is important.  \n\nParents don't live forever, and maybe you're concerned he might regret ending his relationship with them someday and want to spare him that pain?\n\nIf he's not okay with you meddling, though, you should respect that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s also pretty shitty to minimise and dismiss your partners feelings about his parents.\n\nFrom the information you provided it sounds like that incident was a catalyst for your partner to review and recontextualise his relationship with his parents in general, he made the decision he was better off without them.

You don\u2019t know how the exchange went and honestly knowing better would be not making those accusations at all. These people never met you and assumed off the bat you were after money.

That isn't your place and to not respect his feelings on this are also inappropriate.", "YTA", "NAH. But you could have been more tactful. It's really great that he takes your honor so seriously, but his duty to you has been done. You understandably don't want him to alienate his family over this. Is it possible that there's a little more to his reaction? Have his parents done or said similar things about his past girlfriends? Talk to him about it and be open to his answer. He might need some time to forgive his parents. Hear him out and let him know that you always stand behind him.", "NTA.  I don\u2019t think it deserves an apology, but maybe another discussion where you can ask if there\u2019s something more going on and gently suggest that it might be nice to get back in contact with them, especially if there are going to be grandkids.", "YTA for the silly comment but the rest is more nuanced than the reactionaries on this thread are making it out to be.  INFO: Is your husband someone prone to black-and white thinking, snap judgements, and holding grudges?  Because if that's the case you might be right but you should know the chances he will eventually decide you are also The Enemy are pretty high.  If he's generally a reasonable person, then it's possible you haven't heard the whole story, or that he didn't come to terms with the other ways his parents were controlling or unable to back down until it was directed toward someone else. I mean, I would have described what a \"hero\" my mom was before I came to terms with her emotional abuse in college. Regardless, I would apologize for the silly comment and walk back your position  to \"I would have no objection to you rekindling your relationship.\"  I would then leave space for him to confide in you what actually happened, but i wouldnt demand it.  You've said your piece, you've conveyed that the speed of your relationship was enough that its natural for parental eyebrows to be raised, the rest just isn't your decision to make.", "Part of it could be that his parents did not respect, listen to him and his opinion regarding his then fiance.

On point and very well said.", "Yeah, I have a feeling this was just the final straw, probably in a long history of them not respecting his choices/opinions.", "Well, no. I guess I would probably feel different but I still think their worry would have been warranted. He was telling his parents he wanted to marry a girl he had been dating for only six months and that they had never met! \n\nMy parents weren\u2019t particularly ecstatic either. They never said anything about money but they did ask why not wait a bit longer. I made it clear that this kind of talk would not be tolerated and they moved on. They love my husband now, more than they love me I think sometimes!", "Maybe there's more context/background to the NC. She married her husband, not his parents. She should trust him and take her cues about his parents from him.", "I don\u2019t think there is more to it. After his cousin let it slip (she thought I already knew) we talked about it. They were emphatic about it but it was just that. I asked if there was more and he said no. I don\u2019t think he would have lied, specially since he could just have said there was but he didn\u2019t want to talk about it. I would have respected as I have before.", "YTA Heres the thing though. I\u2019m guessing he has more than just this reason as why he went NC. Both my partner and I are Nc with our mothers. Even after almost 13 years together he still won\u2019t ever know or understand everything my mom did to me. He just saw me finally break after she forgot my birthday a few years back. At surface level that seems like the dumbest reason for not speaking to a parent but it was just the last straw. It\u2019s the same with him. The final straw wouldn\u2019t be that serious in its own but with the history he has with her it all makes sense. You don\u2019t know his full relationship with his parents and you may never fully know or understand. Because of that you should leave how he handles that relationship to him. It could be as simple as them criticizing you or or it could be so much trauma he may never even want to speak about it. Whatever it was it was enough for him to drop his parents completely.

Just because YOU think your husband should get over it, doesn't mean he has to agree.", "YTA his parents questioned and undermined probably his most important decision in life. He is entitled to be offended on his and your behalf. \n\nWhat if he fell in love with someone or you had been dirt poor?

Even if you aren\u2019t hurt by their comments now, he took it as an offence then and if he chose to go NC, it meant that it wasn\u2019t just that one thing, it was probably a lot of things like that built up over the years. Respect his choice, his decisions regarding his own family. He has right to distance himself with people who don\u2019t trust him or respect his decision to take you as a life partner. The reason he went into NC might not have had much to do with his parents calling you a gold digger and more to do with his treatment by his family in general.

Yes, it's possible that you could all work towards reconciliation, but I would urge you to respect his need to keep strong boundaries with his family.", "YTA\n\nHe has a boundary with his parents. This is what brings him peace. Don't trample over that simply because they were wrong. You're lucky your family is richer than him so it's funny to you.

It IS a big deal to him.", "I know you have your husband's best interest at heart but YTA. It's not so much as they were wrong about you, it's about them trusting him to make the right decision when it comes to picking a mate. If it was only about your money he would have just told them but this is about their lack of trust in his decision making and its really up to him to decide if he wants to keep that relationship.", "YTA\n\nYes you should apologize to your husband.  You do not get to decide if the reason is or is not silly when it comes to going NC with a parent.  And based on what you posted this says much:  1)  His parents insulted you.  That says they did not know you, did not care to know you, only believed that you were beneath them and their son.  2)  A child does not go NC with a parent over one incident, but when the bad behavior goes on for years.  \n\nI get the feeling that what they said about you was the straw that broke the camel's back.  That there was far more there that was going on and he just grew tired of it all and said NO MORE.  You just do not know the whole story.\n\nI grew up with abusive parents, make no mistake my parents were the old school hands on abusive kind of parents.  To their friends and co workers to describe me, I was a good kid.  What they never told their friends or coworkers, was how they treated me at home.  How my father would insult me and make me feel like I was worthless and not worth his time.  How my mother would punish me if I did not do the dishes, or the laundry, or have the dinner ready by a certain time, or how she would scream at me cause I missed a corner of a table from dusting it, how I was the groundskeeper and living domestic.  How if I did not do it right, that I was forced to redo the entire task.  Oh no, they never went into that, I was just a good kid.  And god forbid if I spoke ill of my parents, then I was an ungrateful brat who needed to be further punished and forced to do more work.  \n\nThe straw that broke the camels back for me when I went NC with my parents, is that I was sick one day and returned home.  All I wanted was some aspirin.  My father pretty much told me off and how dare I return home.  I left and never went back, not for a good 8 years, leaving them to wonder for the first few where I was, and then after that to be praying I would return cause the really needed me, more than I needed them.\n\nSo as you can see OP, it was not one thing that caused me to go NC with my parents, but years of mistreatment at their hands.  It was the telling off by my father that was the straw that broke the camel's back.", "Very soft YTA. \n\nThis issue want about the money, it was about them undermining his decision. This is also likely not the first time they did that either. He told them \u201cI found the woman I love\u201d and they said \u201cshe doesn\u2019t love you, she wants your money.\u201d  (Almost a gaslighting mentality on one of the biggest decisions in his life). \n\n**This isn\u2019t about what they assumed of you, it\u2019s about how they treated him!**", "I am NC with my family for different reasons. Anyone telling me I should repair the relationship is dismissing my feelings and my experiences without having full and lived context. That is exasperating and infuriating.\n\nI'm glad you're not bothered by their behavior as reported to you, but you truly DO NOT have any information or experience of their past behavior. You don't know all the incidents that led to this break. I mean this nicely, but you're not qualified to judge here. \n\nPlease apologize for invalidating his feelings and decisions and let him deal with this going forward. Respect his decision. Support him with the intensity that he seems to support you.", "YTA, he stood up for you against his own parents and you've diminished that to being silly. I've seen post after post after post on here from people being belittled, disrespected, etc by their in-laws, crying out because their partner won't step up and stand up for them. You owe him a big apology, and you need to let him know that you stand with him, just as he stood with you.", "YTA - albeit gently. I think you are only considering this from your perspective. You don't feel that slighted, so it feels silly to you.\n\nI would ask that you consider that this isn't as much about you as it seems on the surface. I'm sure on some level your husband was defending you, but he's also defending his own judgement and his ability to make his own choices.\n\nPeople don't leap straight to \"no contact\" with close family after one incident (unless that incident is extreme). I think it's far more likely that his family has been controlling or minimizing his choices for a long time, and this was just the final straw. It may have even been the kind of thing he's wanted to do for awhile, but he has trouble standing up for himself. Sometimes it's far easier to stand up for others than ourselves. Thats certainly been true for myself.", "YTA...that man stood up for you against his parents.", "NTA Abuse aside, people generally cut family out of their lives for reasons that can be worked out. It\u2019s all about relationships people. It seems like wife cares about husband and his relationship with his family and is trying to help. Good for her for not being a \u201cyes man\u201d and instead helping him with his relationships.", "NTA for giving him your opinion, but now that it's done and he's not interested, you have to drop it. It's not your fault he went no contact. It's not your fault he's staying no contact. Please don't see it as your responsibility to fix their relationship or a personal failure of yours that you can't -- the decision was his and his alone.\n\n100% guarantee there is more to the story you don't know. But it's his relationship, and you have to respect his wishes about it. You've assured him you don't hold a grudge over it and aren't going to stop him, which is great that you made sure he knew. You've given him your opinion, which is your right. Now you have to let it go.", "I agree with you, it sounds stupid and pointless. While it\u2019s glorious he defended you, has his family treated him so horribly that this hill is worth dying on. I also can\u2019t get past the fact that he could have easily explained your family can match his dollar for dollar. It seems that if at his age he is willing to quit seeing his parents permanently then either he had one shitty relationship or there is something more going on. NTA.", "NTA. Though you probably could have phrased it better than silly. You were obviously trying to help. And not knowing the details it does definitely seem a bit over the top. \n\n\nYou would be TA if you kept pushing it. There could (and probably is) more to the story. Like a lot of people said, It could have been the last of a long list of issues.", "That or his parents respected him when he said he wanted to go NC, like they should.", "My thoughts are they most likely thought and said this of all his former girlfriends, and they were probably pretty harsh, more so than \"she's a gold digger\"", "They also could have given him an ultimatum at the time. Something along the lines of, fine, marry her, but you\u2019re dead to us, kind of thing.  So he picked his side.  He likely knows he proved them wrong at this point but having his folks give him an all or nothing choice without ever having met you, might have cut deeper than you would think. It\u2019s all speculation of course. But I have a feeling that since you heard about this from a cousin, and not from your husband, that the cousin likely has only either heard the side of his parents, OR heard very limited info from your hubs.  There\u2019s more to this story than the info you have. Be gentle with him. I\u2019m sure his choice at the time was t an easy one.", "How would you have felt if they hadn\u2019t just moved on after you set that boundary? What would you do if they continued to talk/ask about things that you had already made it clear \u201cwouldn\u2019t be tolerated\u201d?", "I completely agree\u2026there are always three sides to every story side A side B and a bit of the middle\u2026\n\nSome things are simply too painful to talk about, ypu know?", "But he hasn\u2019t shared anything other then his parents calling her a potential gold digger, so we should stick that fact. OP is NTA- he is upset on her behalf. It\u2019s extremely frustrating for someone to be upset on your behalf when you yourself are no longer aggrieved, or in OP\u2019s case, not even aggrieved at all. I\u2019m sure OP wants to starts a family, that includes a relationship with the in laws. Her husband should open up if there\u2019s more to the story, otherwise like I previously stated\u2026 NTA.", "YTA - but not really a HUGE one. I am not in contact with a brother, while my husband knows why he thinks that 10 years is a really long time, he\u2019s mentioned it, but ultimately that\u2019s my family and my choice. He chooses to support me even though that\u2019s not what he would do.", "YTA... And also a very bad partner... For you as long as they treat well, you don't care how they treat/treated your husband...", "YTA- Do you think that\u2019s the only thing they said about you?  He told you the mild stuff, look be grateful\nthat he stood up for you. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s weird that the rest of the family isn\u2019t trying to force a reconciliation? Why do you think that is?  Leave your husband alone.", "YTA - apologize and move on, or he may start resenting you.", "Yes. YTA. Like everyone else said...it probably was the last straw. Considering how your husband stood up for you, he's a good man. \n\nWhat makes a good man go no contact with his family? Years of bad behaviour that can't be noticed in a short time.", "YTA. Didn't even read the story. His reasons are his alone and you have nothing to say about it.", "What if the parents are NC because he\u2019s still with you? What if that\u2019s the ultimatum? You ever think of that? YTA", "YTA.  MYOB.  You should definitely apologize for judging his decision.  \n\n\nSure it's ok to say \"hey I feel OK with this and understand where they are coming from.\"  He gets to make his own choices.  Do you want him to label your decisions as silly or dramatic?  No?  Maybe there are other little aggressions that have added up over the years.  Whatever, let him sort out his relationships like an adult, and disagree with him if you want, but don't ridicule him.", "YTA stay in your lane", "YTA, there's something missing here, and it's not your place to judge your husband's reasons for not wanting to speak to his parents. Calling it silly is kind of degrading tbh", "Yta. I am glad you are ok and that you want him to have a good relationship with his parents but what they said isnt ok. He cut contact in support of you becauseit wasnt ok. I guess you havent seen enough on reddit to understand that in laws can be hell. And you invalidated his feelings by calling it silly.", "YTA. Calling something silly is belittling it. I'm sure you didn't mean to but don't belittle your husband's pain.", "I think your heart is in the place. However, you need to stand by your husband and if his decision making is normally kosher then accept he went NC for good reason. Apologize and support whatever he decides to do with his fam. I\u2019m glad you have enough dinero to not be offended but it\u2019s an offensive remark from his parents. NTA", "Your husband stood by you, and you appreciate that effort by throw it out of the window for... what? Pride? Fun? Nothing? You are not the worst, but you don't deserve the loyalty of your husband. You are insensitive and careless. YTA.", "Softly YTA\n\nLet's not minimize him giving up a relationship with his parents like that. You should apologize, also while he did it for you, that's not all. He was hurt by their words/actions too. And tbh I doubt the cousin knows the full story.", "I feel you should apologize tbh. I feel like it\u2019s more than just he\u2019s not talking to them just bc they called you a gold digger. Seems there\u2019s much more too it than that and you calling him silly probably made his feelings feel invalidated. It\u2019s not your responsibility to mend his relationship with his parents that\u2019s just something he needs to do on his own with your support on whatever he\u2019s choosing to do. If it\u2019s something he doesn\u2019t wish to talk about than I wouldn\u2019t talk about it. I\u2019ve gone NC with my parent bc of something horrible she said about my SO but that wasn\u2019t the reason I went NC, the insult to him was just the straw that broke the camels back. Him talking them up about being great means nothing. Not everyone wants to make their parents seem terrible by exposing you to all their traumas and such out of fear they will scare their partner off. Some feel it\u2019s better to lie on their behalf so when you meet them you don\u2019t have any awkward distaste for them upon meeting. Personally I would apologize and just wait it out. When he\u2019s ready he will come to you, you might learn more information on the matter at a later point.", "YTA", "NAH. While your argument is certainly logical, I can speak from the side of someone who didn\u2019t speak to his father from when I was 14 to when he died when I was around 27. All I did was stop calling him. That\u2019s what it took to \u201cgo NC\u201d. I wonder if your husband can tell a similar story?", "Oops \u2026 What transpired. It must be HUGE since he wouldn\u2019t even BROACH the subject for YEARS. YTA but just because you think you know but likely don\u2019t know the half of it. He\u2019s unlikely to fill in the blanks, just love him where he\u2019s at and trust his judgement that he\u2019s gotten himself where he wants to be - with you and without them. One day you may thank him for sparing you the details about the Axe Murderer they kept in the basement!", "ESH, except your husband.", "TA belittling the reason may just make him stick to it more", "PLEASE apologize to him and let him know you support him and will stay out of it. Probably for your protection, he hasn't revealed the true story. Nobody cuts off parents without good reason. It might have built up over a lifetime. He needs to know that you choose him over them.", "YTA - you don't get to decide if why he went NC is silly or not. This was probably the straw that broke the camel's back. \n\nYou should be grateful that you have a husband that automatically stood up for you and defended you against disrespect from his parents.", "What's NC?", "On your point 2.... I simply stopped calling my mother and waited for her to call me first for once.  It'd been 14 years. Nobody really brings up how hurtful it is that I was so easy to abandon. The childhood stuff was SUPER bad and traumatic, but nobody realizes that, even though I went NC, the fact that she didn't lift a finger to fight it hurt deeply as well.  Esp when I had to find out grandma died through her FB.\n\nThank you for pointing this part out.  People seem to miss it somehow.", "This.\n\nYou likely have no idea as to what level of pain is required to make someone decide that severing oneself from one's parent(s) is the best remaining option. Going no-contact is excruciating - in the immediate sense and in the long term. It is not something done and maintained in response to a misunderstanding or a petty insult.\n\n**Source:** NC for over 3 decades from my mother and everyone on her side of the family.\n\nYTA despite having kind intentions. This isn't your decision to make.", "NTA\nSure he was protecting her honor and defending her from his parents but wtf did he not tell her what she was being protected from? She has a right to know since she is the injured party. If she herself decides that it's not a big deal then that should count for a lot.", "The cousin was probably paraphrasing, and the comment was probably much worse.", "there also must be more to the story", "That\u2019s the thing for me. That their insulting and derogatory opinion turned out to be *factually incorrect* is largely irrelevant to the issue. \n\nOP, if his parents had said \u201cdon\u2019t marry that n****r\u201d, would you laugh off his concern on the basis that you\u2019re not black? (Assuming you\u2019re not.)", "I almost told op they were ta for not realizing they weren't gonna end up being a jnmil frequenter and what a gift that would be!", "It's because she adores her husband's parents...", "To be fair i want her to keep going... Then we will be able to laugh at her post about not knowing what to do because her husband left her for boundary stomping.", "No contact.", "Ooof. I'm so sorry. I'm in a similar boat with my father. I found out two of my grandfathers died this year... As in, they died in 2019 and I decided to google them this year and found obituaries.\n\nExcept my dad flat out disowned me, but he never said he was doing it and he never told me why. I was 14", "He gets to make the decision about his parents, not OP. \n\nAnd Op isn\u2019t the only victim. They also judged his judgement by accusing her of being a gold digger, they accused him of being stupid and  marrying a gold digger.", "I wonder who the cousin heard it from. Because that could also change the narrative of that story as well. Or how much info the cousin was given about the exchange. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s significantly worse than what OP was told.", "People with nice families constantly downplay and dismiss the feelings of people who go no contact, they can\u2019t understand because they could never. \n\nThere\u2019s more to it than that and you should stop belittling him.", "> they did ask why not wait a bit longer. I made it clear that this kind of talk would not be tolerated \n\nIsn't this a bit of an overreaction to them just asking a simple question?  I can understand if your parents were insulting or verbally abusive but you kind of went from 0 to 60 within a couple sentences.", "Obviously the person who will or won't make the reconciliation is OP's husband. The only thing we're debating on is whether the OP is TA for telling him he's being silly. If he was going NC because he was defending OP's honor, it's one thing. But if he's really going NC because he was offended that his parents thought he'd marry a gold-diggers, it's another. To me, this is such a slight thing to go NC over but there's no way of knowing if this is just the thing that broke the camel's back or not. There's not enough info.", "Exactly. OP didn't think it all the way through."]}
