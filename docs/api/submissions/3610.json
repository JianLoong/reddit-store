Yes you are absolutely being taken advantage of, no doubt. But if your morals are so strong you won't watch the world cup, then shouldn't your morals keep you from not doing your job? Speak with your boss, tell boss that you feel you should not be left to hold down the fort alone. Have a plan as to what would make it acceptable to you , and present that to your boss. The worst thing that will happen is you get fired. The best case scenario is that you set boundaries with coworkers that work for everyone.
