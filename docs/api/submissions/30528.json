His PE class was playing baseball and he got hit in the face with a ball and got knocked out. \n\nFortunately the ball was a soft foamy texture. He had CT, MRI, and a host of other exams. They diagnosed him with a slight concussion and had a gnarly black eye and abrasions on his cheek. \n\nHe was cleared to go back to school and looked a little fucked up. Everyone knew what happened and some of his teachers emailed us to see how he was doing. We emailed them to keep an eye on him.\n\nToday my son came home and said his teacher asked what happened to his face. He was confused. Like everyone knew. He's a 6th grader and even the 7th and 8th graders and their teachers knew. The fucking ambulance came to the school.\n\nHis teacher held him at lunch  today. Ms. D said he could tell her the truth because his face didn't look like a baseball hit it but \"someone\" did. He said no, it was a baseball. She asked how he was being treated at home. He said fine. She said she didn't believe his story and would have to tell the principal. My son said okay.\n\nWhen my son told me this, I started to laugh. No way is his teacher this fucking dumb. Well, sure enough I get an email a couple of hours later from the VP saying a staff member submitted a report that they were suspicious of my son's face. The VP assured the staff that it was from an injury at school. Like everyone knew.\n\nI was so mad that I emailed Ms. D and told her I knew she submitted this report trying to start shit. How could she be that fucking stupid? She knew about the accident but she didn't think a baseball to the face would leave a blackeye. This caused all of us so much needless stress. I think she was trying to get brownie points and look busy. \n\nI also replied to the VP that my son now has extreme anxiety going back to her class and we're worried that he'll start experiencing headaches from being stressed out over his dumbass teacher. This could had gone real bad. He replied that he was taking this seriously and she won't be in my son's 3rd period class tomorrow. I think they will be having a meeting with her at that time.", "created_utc": 1699401427, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17q8foj/aita_for_reporting_my_kids_teacher_for_being/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't blame her for asking, it is possible that she somehow didn't hear about the incident. I also don't blame her for being suspicious - kids will lie when they are being abused at home. But in this case, the incident happened at school. As soon as your son told her that it happened in PE class, she could have left him alone and confirmed with his PE teacher that this was true. If the teacher had told her that your son lied, she could still have reported it. At the very least, she should have noticed when she was starting to make him uncomfortable and should have left then - how does she think real abuse victims will react if she treats them this way?\n\nThere was absolutely no point in pressuring your son for more information and stressing him out when he told her a story that was this easy to confirm.

Why is someone so irresponsible in charge of children? Good lord", "YTA. You can\u2019t know for certain that every single teacher was aware of this, and while perhaps she was a touch overzealous, ffs-don\u2019t we WANT teachers to be extraordinarily cautious?", "NTA", "NTA. I think the teacher is pretty stupid, or just naive. Some people have gone through a lot of life without seeing a real injury from anything. Cuts, bruises, broken anything. I've had a variety of everything you can think of, and I remember one of the weirder ones I had being falling on my knee while being piggybacked, then a tickle fight, then falling on the same knee again. I had to go to the hospital (I was about 13?) and I thought I'd dislocated my kneecap because of how swollen the side of my knee was. Just water retention. BUT, the bruise I got from that injury leaked down my leg in this weird pattern so that a week later when I was swimming, I had a lady I didn't know come up to me to ask me if my dad beat me. I didn't have a dad, I was a foster kid in a single mom's grouphome, so I just gave her this 'wtf' look and left. \n\nBodies do weird things. Movies make things look different than reality and someone who isn't familiar with violence of what injuries look like can be really surprised when a ball to the face swells up that much. Either the teacher is that naive, or she has a past history that she's projecting onto her students. Either way, she was aware of the incident and twisted it into something to the point she stressed out the son and made a complaint to the principal. That's pretty dumb.", "NAH.", "Is Ms. D new at being a teacher? I just wonder if she's new to the whole \"mandated reporter\" thing.\n\nNTA though.

Once the VP told her though she needed to accept that and stop.", "YTA and incredibly ignorant. Honestly I feel bad for your kid because *your* response is what's making him feel uncomfortable.\n\nHere's a situation- a kid gets hit with a baseball, requiring an ER visit so their parent has to miss work and pay all these doctor's bills. When that parent and child go home, the parent clocks the kid for wasting his time and money over getting hit with a soft baseball. No one at school suspects a thing because \"everyone knows\" it's \"just a baseball injury.\"\n\nYou should be so fucking thankful this ONE teacher stepped up and is looking out for tour kid and actually takes their mandatory reporter position seriously. You're ignorant AF and owe that teacher a personal apology.", "Wow, I don\u2019t know why she\u2019d report you, you seem like such a reasonable person \ud83d\ude44\n\nNAH- Teachers have a duty of care; they raise a concern and it\u2019s investigated- This has been raised and investigated- End of.", "ESH (except the kid obviously). The teacher is an AH because she went too far doing the report and pushing the kid despite him insisting on what really happened, especially with a bit of common sense since it sounds like basically every other person in the school knew what happened and she just didn't believe everyone. It she'd checked with anyone else her side of the issue would never have happened, but she ignored everyone and the kid himself and pushed on. However, OP is also an AH for going so far in reaction to this with personally emailing the teacher directly with insults and being extremely rude. A sensible reaction would be contacting the school administrators specifically and informing them of the teacher ignoring what the kid was telling her and making things into a far bigger deal when the kid was already known to have just gone through a lot with the injury itself. This would possibly have been plenty for action to be taken on her and/or the kid not having to deal with her anymore, but instead OP made it personal, taking it too far in return.", "YTA. You turned an opportunity to teach your son about how someone might not believe them, but the facts and truth will out, into a personal attack on a mandated reporter. The person causing any stress here was you. \n\nThe VP knew about the accident, but still had to inform you of the report. There was no shit being started by anyone except you, and if this is how you typically react then that teacher was right to be concerned.", "Your son handled this beautifully. He told her what happened, she said she\u2019d still have to report it, and he said okay.\n\nYou handled it appallingly.

She could have not been there.  She could have heard something happened but didn't know what...or she could just mind her own business and not heard about it.  Yea it's frustrating to be accused of something but she's doing her job.", "YTA.", "YTA. It\u2019s very clear from your responses that this is not about you protecting your son. Please drop this vendetta against the teacher before you ruin your son\u2019s entire school experience.", "NTA\n\nIt is a crime for a person to knowingly make a false report to DCF. Here's the text of the law in my state:\n\n>Any person who knowingly makes a false report of child abuse or neglect may be fined not more than $2,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year or both. The identity of such person shall be disclosed to the appropriate law enforcement agency and to the alleged perpetrator of the abuse.\n\nIf it were me, I'd file a complaint with the police about this teacher.", "NTA. Normally I\u2019d say otherwise but given the exact context, I\u2019d be speaking with the superintendent and demanding a new teacher for my kid.", "INFO: People employed at schools these days, how exactly does this process work?\n\nIs it possible for the suspecting teacher to chat with someone about the situation first before it becomes a giant formal case with lots of paperwork, school record entries, etc? Could this have been nipped in the bud at some level before it became a big deal?\n\nIf the teacher hadn't gotten word that it was from a PE accident, I can see the initial concern. And she was right to mention it to a supervisor. If that supervisor had the power to say \"Nah don't worry, it happened in PE\" and end it, but the teacher still pressed, the anger at her is justified. If the system is set up that the supervisor then has no choice but to escalate, then N-A-H, that's just the way the system works.", "YTA - she\u2019s a teacher who was concerned about a black eye. Even though your son was hit by a baseball previously doesn\u2019t mean an abuser didn\u2019t give him a black eye after that, capitalizing on the opportunity or blaming him for standing in the way of the baseball.

The report she made was easily refuted, multiple sources witnessed the ball event and could back you up, so it did not tarnish your reputation in any way. Odds are she has her own trauma history, has seen a lot of abuse situations in the past with other students or has seen other things that has given her concern for your child's safety - any of which are understandable reasons to react the way she did. Your reaction makes you seem overly defensive and honestly, that's kinda concerning. Being a mandated reporter is *hard* man; it's really really hard; to know when you should or shouldn't make the report, to fear the repercussions and have to do it anyways, and it's pretty much always understandable to go with better safe than sorry.

Better safe than sorry.", "I agree that she wasn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting it. But pressuring a child to the point where he has to much anxiety to come to her class can't be the right solution. She obviously wasn't equiped to handle this situation, and it would have been even worse if he actually was a victim of abuse. She could have asked someone else to talk to him, like the school counselor. Or in this case, when the boy told her that it happened in PE, she could have just asked the PE teacher to confirm it. There were a million better ways to go about this, and she chose the worst.", "[removed]", "But the accident happened at the school with tons of witnesses and the child was transferred in an ambulance to the ER to be diagnosed. How could this put suspicion on the parents? It literally makes no sense. \n\nCPS is no joke and frivolous complaints can destroy the stability of a family in worst scenarios. It\u2019s really important to have actual grounds to report these suspicions, not just made up ideas of what could have happened.

Not every parent beats their kids, but it's often the least suspicious parents who do. \n\nI prosecute crimes against children for a living. I myself tell people that I want ANYONE suspicious of any abuse of MY OWN child to report it. I know nothing will be founded because i dont abuse my kids, but their willingness to step up would show me that other people out there care about my child and their well being. \n\nIf everyone looks the other way, it perpetuates abuse and empowers abusers.", "Teachers are mandatory reporters.

Better safe that sorry when it comes to a child getting abused. Glad you understand", "Yes, 500% yes. I would rather go through an investigation process than make someone who reported a potential abuse event feel bad about their decision to report. The next instance she reports could save a child\u2019s life. I don\u2019t want her second guessing herself.", "And with this response, you're wondering why the teacher asked your kid if everything is alright at home????", "Man I feel bad for your kid to have a dad like you lol", "Yeah, dude, you are looking less and less innocent. I am not at all surprised the teacher was concerned.", "Do not ever say anything like that again. Especially not in writing. Delete this now.", "Okay, honestly? The entire way the post was written, the defensiveness and the jump to insulting her and making demands about her gives me pause. If the situation went down the way OP said; tons of witnesses, admin immediately told the teacher there was no cause for concern and everything was okay, so the report was dismissed before going anywhere, why is OP soooo angry and demanding she not be his teacher anymore? I feel like the normal response would be to think it's weird, maybe be annoyed, request a meeting with the teacher to talk things out, ask the school to reassure the son; things like that. The report was easily squashed by witnesses, there's really no reason to escalate things further - scaring a teacher out of making reports does absolutely no one (especially actual abused children) any good. \n\nYes, the scenario in which the injury was caused by abuse is unlikely, but who knows what else this teacher has seen. We don't know why she was suspicious. Could she just be a busy body? Sure, maybe. But we don't have her side of the story, and as a mandated reporter myself, I know how complicated and difficult these kinds of things can be... and I also know how abusive parents sometimes respond. I'm not saying OP is abusive, I have absolutely no way of knowing such a thing, but their attitude is concerning.", "The teacher may have been busy teaching during that time. Or the teacher was absent, doesn't gossip with the other teachers, simply missed the event etc. Obviously someone in Admin failed to let her know that the OP's child was injured and coming back to class. She wasn't trying to start anything, she was doing what she is legally required to do. She submitted a report to admin and admin then let her know no further action was needed.", "Nice absolutes", "Yeah so they ask once. They don't badger to the point that the kid is now traumatized by the teacher.", "You're arguing with people who have very limited life experience compared to the amount of time they spend on this forum.

You literally made a career off child abuse.", "Yeah.. umm...\n\nShe reported that she was suspicious of a child's face after an incident that happened literally *at school* and the kid went to the ER *from the school* for AND the parent emailed ALL of the teachers to let them know that this happened AAAAAND the child backed it up.\n\nWhat kills me here is that the teacher told the child *to his face* that she did not believe him.\n\nWhat kind of fuckery is this?", "Wait are you ACTUALLY reporting every parent of children with any missing tooth?", "Who knows what else the teacher may have seen? Ok so you suspect the teacher has seen other evidence of abuse over time and thought this was a pattern. I didn\u2019t see any accusation or evidence of that in the post. \n\nYou have, in your mind, an idea of how a parent should behave if reported for suspected child abuse. Ok, that\u2019s your perception. I can tell you, plenty of innocent parents would react very very badly at the accusation they would abuse their own child. This is not evidence of guilt or abuse.", "Ummmmmmmm.....no.\n\nI literally sent group emails to all his teachers to keep them up to date about his condition.", "That doesn't make their point less significant. If a family member was abusing your child, wouldn't you want it reported and brought to your attention???? So that the abuse stops??? It's nearly the same logic here, except you're too offended to see the teacher has good intentions for your child. If you have nothing to hide, you shouldn't be so upset that you remove your kid out of her class. Now, the teacher may have overreacted but they had a good response to what they thought might be an injury too severe for it to ONLY be caused by a baseball and that should not be punished at all.", "OP emailed SOME of the teachers....not this one.", "Everybody here wants to end child abuse and wants it reported. Unless you have personal experience with CPS cases, you may not appreciate how harmful frivolous cases can be. It would seem in this scenario out of all the administrators and teachers in this school, only one had her own suspicions. \n\nFrivolous cases draw resources away from kids in desperate circumstance."]}
