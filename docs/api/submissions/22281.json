But no, I got to the bottom and all you said was an adult, a 34 YEAR OLD MAN, doesn't know how to call an Uber or use a shoehorn. That's a level of incompetence that is actually concerning. I would be humiliated if I was that bad at being an adult too, but that's nothing to do with you.\n\nYour brother needs thicker skin and your family needs to kindly pull the sticks out of their asses.", "YTA - I would never talk bad about my sibling to my extended family. It also sounds like you have a little bit of resentment towards your brother. Bringing up stuff from 4 years ago is ridiculous, let it go.

The relatives that keep comparing you to your brother are also guilty, but if you have been helping your brother voluntarily you can't expect him to suddenly stop asking you for help with stuff.

I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll develop these skills as and when he needs them and if not you should be helping him as best you can.", "NAH.

You need to work this out in another manner however. \n\nTrashing him when he isn't even there to defend himself isn't fair to him nor is it to yourself. You can't justify this by saying \"its time to face the harsh truth\" because you didn't even say it to him. You said this to up yourself. Don't do that.\n\nYour parents and relatives suck for pushing the sibling rivalry.

Disparaging a family member to other family members is usually going to be something to regret. \n\nI hope you understand that if your brother is a physician intensivist, he is literally saving lives and making life and death decisions every single day.

So have some respect. \n\nSo if you\u2019re able to respectfully help your brother, then do so.

Sounds like the brother has a lot going on with his job & is probably stressed out. To put him down was a low blow & you didn\u2019t have to say anything. \n\nThat being said, I get it. Constantly being compared with another person, especially a family member is annoying af. You both are living your own lives  & doing your own thing.

It's kind of hard to be proud of someone's accomplishments when these very accomplishments are the weapon those around you use to constantly put you down . \n\nWhile the brother shouldn't have been put on the spot in this specific case ( since he wasn't there ) , he doesn't sound all that better . There is no mention at all of him standing up for his little brother when their extended family uses him as an example to call OP a failure .

Cannot believe the amount of Y T A's here. OP is constantly being denigrated by everyone by being compared to a man who doesn't know how to order an Uber. I'd snap too. Their parents have done the brother no favors, and he doesn't seem to want to change. OP is  just stating the truth here.", "Right? The family and specifically the cousin that told his brother are major AHs, but finally breaking after years of being called a failure is NTA. \n\nEveryone is screaming neurodivergence and just giving this 34 year old man a complete pass on being incompetent at normal life. Sounds more like weaponized incompetence to me. Dude realized he could do literally nothing so long as he was doing good in school and later working a prestigious job. Even if he is neurodivergent that's not in any way an excuse for not being able to use Google. I say that as someone autistic, yeah, there are some challenges, but it doesn't give me a pass to focus on literally nothing outside of my own interests.", "Presumably all this has happened in front of the brother numerous times in the past . He doesn't seem to have defended OP when he is the weapon of choice the relatives use to put OP down . That's not what a good brother does either...", "And OP sounds like a bully.", "My grandfather never could handle money, he was great with his hands and electricity, but he was clueless with money.\n\nSome people really are 'stupid' in things others find normal.\n\nShoehorns are out of fashion, it's like op rolling his eyes at a person unable to work a floppy.\n\nNot knowing how to use paypal / venmo / whatever is not weird if you're used to cash / bank transfers/ cards.", "Being incompetent doesn\u2019t make him an AH or OP not the AH.\n\nPutting someone down who hasn\u2019t disrespected you does.  Also allowing others to disrespect you and instead of putting up a boundaries OP decides to divert the disrespect to his brother makes him the AH", "As long as his parents keep enabling it, unfortunately. If someone never learns something, they can't be expected to know it, right?\n\nBut then again, what *medical professional* can't use logic and reasoning to figure stuff out?", "Many physicians work so much and make so much, they pay someone to handle all their shit. This guy doing intensives shifts, if in the United States, easily making $300k + and with overtime easy half million.", "An adult still living at home, totally uninterested in having a partner, so fixated on his academic interests that he \u201conly stops to eat and sleep\u201d, would rather be at work than a family get-together, academically gifted in one particular area but has to ask for advice on day-to-day \u201ceasy\u201d tasks.. that is fully the poster child for undiagnosed neurodivergence", "Right like if we all described people who were too lazy google things as neurodivergent then that would be almost all people 60+. The stuff OP is listing off aren\u2019t \u201cbasic life skills\u201d but are just things people learn via googling or being shown, but OP\u2019s brother has decided he\u2019s google. \n\nI\u2019ve never used a shoehorn before, so realistically I actually have no idea how they work, I don\u2019t know how you send money via PayPal (but I am not American), and I didn\u2019t know how Uber worked till a friend showed me. I\u2019m not autistic.", "So extended family is big ass. OP should set up boundaries or go LC or NC with them if they can\u2019t respect his boundaries.

He threw his brother in front of AH relatives as a bait to divert attacks from him. More so he went behind his back so he had no chance to defend him.
