I would be humiliated if I was that bad at being an adult too, but that's nothing to do with you.\n\nYour brother needs thicker skin and your family needs to kindly pull the sticks out of their asses.", "YTA - I would never talk bad about my sibling to my extended family. It also sounds like you have a little bit of resentment towards your brother. Bringing up stuff from 4 years ago is ridiculous, let it go.

You need to work this out in another manner however. \n\nTrashing him when he isn't even there to defend himself isn't fair to him nor is it to yourself. You can't justify this by saying \"its time to face the harsh truth\" because you didn't even say it to him. You said this to up yourself.

So have some respect. \n\nSo if you\u2019re able to respectfully help your brother, then do so.

Sounds like the brother has a lot going on with his job & is probably stressed out. To put him down was a low blow & you didn\u2019t have to say anything. \n\nThat being said, I get it. Constantly being compared with another person, especially a family member is annoying af. You both are living your own lives  & doing your own thing.

The family and specifically the cousin that told his brother are major AHs, but finally breaking after years of being called a failure is NTA. \n\nEveryone is screaming neurodivergence and just giving this 34 year old man a complete pass on being incompetent at normal life. Sounds more like weaponized incompetence to me. Dude realized he could do literally nothing so long as he was doing good in school and later working a prestigious job. Even if he is neurodivergent that's not in any way an excuse for not being able to use Google. I say that as someone autistic, yeah, there are some challenges, but it doesn't give me a pass to focus on literally nothing outside of my own interests.", "Presumably all this has happened in front of the brother numerous times in the past .

I mean, it's not like we don't all know that everyone would absolutely be losing their shit over a guy like making his wife or gf do all the stuff that ops parents have, but hey, i guess he gets a pass here because he's a doctor and that's stuff none of us can do \ud83d\ude44", "My mother can't use an Uber. Nor PayPal. She's very competent in many others areas I'm not.\n\nI can cook, clean, fix things and many of the traditional housekeeping stuff. But I'm not very tech savy so i rely on my brother when making online purchases to se if I do something wrong.\n\nWe all cover for each other.\nWe also complain to each other sometimes. \nYou seem mad. And also you seem like an hypocrite, because there's no way that you are perfect and no one helps you with your downsides.", "Soft YTA because at no point did you say your brother did anything negative TO you.\n\nBut, I can see how it might be tempting to knock him off the pedestal your family has him standing on.  \n\nThen, on another note. Am I the only person who has never even heard the term Intensivist? I had to look it up as I thought it was a term for a neurologically divergent person.", "Then take it out on the people treating you like shit, don't throw someone else into the crossfire as a shield.", "Yes. But the thing is - people like this don't happen by accident. First - a burden was put on him. He was a smart kid. So smart, right? I bet OP can attest to that. There's Our Boy. Going to BE A DOCTOR. Has to do well in school. Can't waste his time on sports or cultural activities. No time for things like social clubs. No honey, don't waste your time with chores, you go study. Study hard. Ace those tests. Do some extracurricular work. Look, there's a special lecture you can attend. There's someone who can mentor you. Why would you want to go to that silly dance?\n\nThese kids are forged, one day at a time. He doesn't know how to do these daily activities, how to balance work and life, how to handle his finances because \\*no-one\\* taught him. They were so busy making him a prodigy they forgot to teach him how to be a person.", "In that case what you do is tell Dr. Brother that you can't be his handyman. What you don't do is talk trash about your brother to family.", "I mean, that was my first thought about OPs brother as well, a lot of the classic signs of aspergers or similar types of autism. Doesn't mean he is, I can't make that call since I'm a random reddit person", "Not saying he us a AH, but if the bro is so successful, perhaps he should get an assistant to take care of these things instead of burdening his brother?\n\nI do believe in family helping each other out, but there are limits...", "Not even my grandparents ever use/used them lol", "Oh yes, the basics of adulting. Uber and Paypal.", "There's not being able to ask your family for help, and there's being utterly unable to help yourself and unwilling to try, leaving your family to take time out of their own lives and do the work of showing you how to do absolutely everything.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not defending OP here; I think he's the AH in this situation. But OP's brother is in his mid-30s, and his parents manage his *entire* non-work life for him. People like OP's brother are why lmgtfy.com was created.\n\nI ask questions of the people in my life, but I at least try to figure things out for myself first. People have their own lives to lead, and it would be pretty selfish to behave as if they exist solely to explain and manage the world for me.", "No people like OP who find having to do anything for anyone else the hardest burden man has ever experienced are why people invented lmgtfy.com", "It\u2019s like a little slide for your heel that you use to put on a shoe without squishing the back down", "Well in his defence, it's a general consensus in the medical community that the epic UI is intentionally made confusing and hard to navigate", "The older brother is quite capable of figuring out how to do these things himself.  An intensivist  in training, as part of their training, routinely will be looking up information and deploying it clinically, including infrequently performed medical procedures. The phrase is \u201csee one, do one, teach one,\u201d but honestly after you make it to a certain level the \u201csee one\u201d gets skipped. \n\nBut when you work 80+ hours a week with terrible hours, and you never interact with your family, sometimes you take whatever excuse you can get to have a reason to talk to them. Even if it\u2019s reaching out about about dumb things you\u2019re perfectly  capable of figuring out yourself. \n\nReally, OP should tell the older brother that he doesn\u2019t like him and doesn\u2019t want to talk to him (because that seems to be the root of the issue). And then magically OP will start learning these things himself, and OP can continue living his unbothered existence.", "I know it\u2019s only one small part of it but I have literally never seen a shoehorn, let alone actually used one. I\u2019m sure that it\u2019s not too difficult to figure out, but we all have things we\u2019ve never used before that are simple for other people. If you wanted me to add a new hard drive or swap out the RAM for your computer I\u2019d have it done in about 2 minutes, but to plenty of other people they wouldn\u2019t even know what a new hard drive looked like \n\nThat being said, if the brother truly is as incompetent as OP is saying that he is, then he does need to learn some self sufficiency. It\u2019s okay to not know how to do everything, but if you don\u2019t know how to do anything that\u2019s a bigger issue", "So he used his logic and asked \"competent in the area\" person (his little brother) to do it. Nothing unlogical here.  \nI'm sure, that if said medical professional had to figure something out, he would do it. But he chose not to waste his time and ask how to do it. What's not logical here?  \nI don't know how to call Uber - never in my life had to use it. But I can do many, many other things, you probably can't do.   \nEven in the prehistoric times people specialised in some crafts and skills and exchanged them.   \nThere is no reason to everybody knowing and doing everything.  \nLittle brother feels so superior, that he figured out how to use Uber? Maybe they change the places and he'll learn how to save human life in a time his brother needs to learn how to use Pay Pal?", "To me that seems like a person that knows what they want and how to get it and Anything else just gets in the way", "In this case, it sounds very cultural and not neuro related. It honestly feels like Marty has so much pressure held over him by his parents that he is so afraid of failure that he cannot stop working and studying for anything. Its pretty typical is some cultures", "Specifically, it keeps the heel from rolling down with your foot.", "> Being a burden on others is not an inherit moral ill.\n\nWhen you _don't need to,_ then yes it fucking well is. Marty doesn't (for all we know) need to.\n\n> Needing others for (even seemingly basic tasks) isn't being an asshole,\n\nBut _using_ others for basic tasks _without actually needing to,_ that _is_ being an asshole.\n\n> it's being human.\n\nA shitty one.", "My kiddo is autistic and it was the first thing i thought of. especially when he mentions that brother has no qualms about asking for help; the embarrassment factor isn't there, and my son is the same way when he asks for help with something he should developmentally be able to do. it doesn't occur to him to be embarrassed because embarrassment is just not really a part of his brain. OP's bro sounds the same way.", "The thing is Bro asked how to use app, doesn't sound like he's asking OP to request uber for him each time, same with shoehorn(once 4 yrs ago)--not asking OP to put his shoes on for him.  etc etc.  \n\nAsking for help the first time could be based in an insecurity(which was perhaps developed by the fact that his parents did not encourage him to try and fail at things--they only encouraged him to do things he would succeed at.)\n\nI have a parent who has learned to Google(took them years) but still most things on computer other than the basics baffle them.  Printer problems--Freak out.  Some people just don't feel comfortable with certain things.   \n\nI don't like using a jigsaw.  And don't even get me started on a circular saw.  Table saws are okay, but jig and circular--No thanks.  You give family and friends Grace as you would like grace from them.  No one is good/perfect at everything.", "If you can say \"he could be helping his parents\" I can say \"he could have autism\"", "Yeah, parents who do this shut do their kids no favours.\n\nI was expected as the oldest child and because I was female to do chores, but my brother never did. For example, at 10 I was expected to do all my own laundry. I taught my brother how to do laundry when he was 16 and I was 19 because my parents were away and I refused to do it for him.", "Yup, my 6yo is autistic and he's got even less filter than most kids, zero sense of shame, and has figured out shit on videogames that I'll never understand.", "Sorry to hear that.\n\nWe built a downstairs apartment for our high functioning son. Fully functional with own external door.\n\nWe also ensured that if he chooses to live there the rest of his life he has the financial means to do so.\n\nHe works, and I am sure if he finds the right person he will move out.  But we planned, from when he was a kid.", "I'm AuDHD and feel like the black sheep between me and my sisters because my mom still has to do a lot to support me, even though I'm intelligent, do well in school, and I've lived on my own for 16 years. My sisters don't have the struggles I do, and it's mainly the household management things I struggle with. I'm pretty sure my Dad is AuDHD, too, and I've had to teach him how to send an email several times but he has successfully owned and operated his own business for 50 years.", "The brother hasn\u2019t been doing that though", "Did you not read the part where they endlessly compare OP to someone who dedicates literally 100% of his life to work? That's an asshole move. Children & adult children do not need to be compared - they're different people with different goals and motivations.", "Being that level incompetent at 34 years old absolutely makes you an asshole. OP is TA for what he did, but that doesn't make a grown man who can't work a simple app, or use a shoehorn not TA as well. 34 is plenty old enough to have some basic ability to handle your own shit, and figure things out for yourself. I would certainly not have any faith in him as a medical professional, regardless of grades or knowledge, if he's too intellectually rigid to be able to learn new things on his own. Also, his parents have to manage his finances and investments because he can't be bothered to figure out normal adult shit? That dude is a colossal asshole if all that shit is true.", "But it is weird to have gone to college for so many years and not understand how to google something. Heck, he could just ask his cell phone and Siri or Alexa will tell him the answer along with a link to a video to watch someone using a shoe horn. It\u2019s weaponized incompetence to not know how to find answers and adult unless there are disabilities preventing understanding. Clearly, if he can become a doctor, he can comprehend how to do basic addition and subtraction to keep a bank account", "It's probably apocryphal but there is story that Einstein didn't know/remember his own phone number.  Some suggest it was because he had dyslexia(not something I necessarily agree with).\n\nI say why would he bother remember it?--he's not going to call himself LOL.", "Yeah, the things OP listed (Uber, PayPal, shoehorn) aren't \"basic life skills\". And brother was asking him how to use them, not asking OP to order him Ubers or put his shoes on for him. A lot of unwarranted vitriol here.", "That still doesn't make the brother TA. Every physician I know is experiencing burnout, regardless of their specialty or work-life balance.  \nYou're also getting one side of the story. He may have friends that he socializes with.  Maybe he is a little clueless about things like ordering an Uber. OK.  I can't figure out Twitter but I'm far from helpless", "This is exactly why I differentiate the \"functioning\" level from the \"masking\" level. Especially today as we're doing more research into autism in women (in whom there tends to be more of a variation in the ratios of \"functioning\" to \"masking\", whereas with men, the ratios tend to remain similar and go up and down together), this needs to be spoken about more - your level of masking will not always correlate with your level of functioning, but NTs always associate the two directly because most of the research we have was done on men for whom this was the case and as a result, this is the commonly-known stereotype in NTs' eyes.", "yes i can blame him.\n\nhe is taking it out on the wrong person.", "We don't actually know that because OP himself states that he's barely talked to the guy in years. He knows only what he hears from others.", "My granddad made an extender for shoehorns for people in his retirement community who couldn\u2019t bend enough to use the standard sized ones. He basically just connected it to a longer straight handle so it could be used from an upright sitting positing. At his memorial service someone brought one and talked about what\u2019s great engineer he was and how such a small thing changed their life. It\u2019s easy to take having a full rage of motion for granted until you don\u2019t have it."]}
