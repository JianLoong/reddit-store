But no, I got to the bottom and all you said was an adult, a 34 YEAR OLD MAN, doesn't know how to call an Uber or use a shoehorn. That's a level of incompetence that is actually concerning. I would be humiliated if I was that bad at being an adult too, but that's nothing to do with you.\n\nYour brother needs thicker skin and your family needs to kindly pull the sticks out of their asses.", "YTA - I would never talk bad about my sibling to my extended family. It also sounds like you have a little bit of resentment towards your brother. Bringing up stuff from 4 years ago is ridiculous, let it go.

The relatives that keep comparing you to your brother are also guilty, but if you have been helping your brother voluntarily you can't expect him to suddenly stop asking you for help with stuff.

I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll develop these skills as and when he needs them and if not you should be helping him as best you can.", "NAH.

You need to work this out in another manner however. \n\nTrashing him when he isn't even there to defend himself isn't fair to him nor is it to yourself. You can't justify this by saying \"its time to face the harsh truth\" because you didn't even say it to him. You said this to up yourself. Don't do that.\n\nYour parents and relatives suck for pushing the sibling rivalry.

Let's hope not for everyone's sake.", "YTA. Disparaging a family member to other family members is usually going to be something to regret. \n\nI hope you understand that if your brother is a physician intensivist, he is literally saving lives and making life and death decisions every single day.

So have some respect. \n\nSo if you\u2019re able to respectfully help your brother, then do so.

If not, help him or not, but don\u2019t disrespect him.", "YTA. \n\nYou were tired and frustrated with your brother because of how your parents are and _not_ because your brother did anything to you. \n\nYour frustration was misdirected and I sure hope you feel like a big man and got the validation you have always wanted now that you belittled him publicly. \n\nThis was a conversation that you had to have with your brother privately since obviously your parents are coddling him (unless he has health issues which are making it very difficult to manage day to day tasks and he needs assistance, in which case you are a GIANT AH).

Who cares! To you they might be simple because you\u2019ve used the services. He hadn\u2019t and apparently likes you enough to ask for your help. \n\nAll you\u2019ve done since childhood is complain about him and be jealous of him. You are projecting your own insecurities outward and taking it out on him.\n\nYou are not a victim and bashing him to your family is outright mean. Get help. You actually really need it.

Big time. We all have things we\u2019re good/bad at. It was wrong for people around you to compare you with you brother, but it was also wrong for you to tease him. And what\u2019s wrong with not knowing how to use Paypal or call an Uber? Not everyone is tech savvy. He\u2019s book smart while you\u2019re just street-normal.

Sounds like the brother has a lot going on with his job & is probably stressed out. To put him down was a low blow & you didn\u2019t have to say anything. \n\nThat being said, I get it. Constantly being compared with another person, especially a family member is annoying af. You both are living your own lives  & doing your own thing.

It's kind of hard to be proud of someone's accomplishments when these very accomplishments are the weapon those around you use to constantly put you down . \n\nWhile the brother shouldn't have been put on the spot in this specific case ( since he wasn't there ) , he doesn't sound all that better . There is no mention at all of him standing up for his little brother when their extended family uses him as an example to call OP a failure .

Cannot believe the amount of Y T A's here. OP is constantly being denigrated by everyone by being compared to a man who doesn't know how to order an Uber. I'd snap too. Their parents have done the brother no favors, and he doesn't seem to want to change. OP is  just stating the truth here.", "Right? The family and specifically the cousin that told his brother are major AHs, but finally breaking after years of being called a failure is NTA. \n\nEveryone is screaming neurodivergence and just giving this 34 year old man a complete pass on being incompetent at normal life. Sounds more like weaponized incompetence to me. Dude realized he could do literally nothing so long as he was doing good in school and later working a prestigious job. Even if he is neurodivergent that's not in any way an excuse for not being able to use Google. I say that as someone autistic, yeah, there are some challenges, but it doesn't give me a pass to focus on literally nothing outside of my own interests.", "Presumably all this has happened in front of the brother numerous times in the past .

Also allowing others to disrespect you and instead of putting up a boundaries OP decides to divert the disrespect to his brother makes him the AH", "As long as his parents keep enabling it, unfortunately. If someone never learns something, they can't be expected to know it, right?\n\nBut then again, what *medical professional* can't use logic and reasoning to figure stuff out?", "Many physicians work so much and make so much, they pay someone to handle all their shit.

At least how OP wrote it, it doesn\u2019t seem like he said \u201cMarty is a stupid loser\u201d but more like \u201cat least I can figure out Uber lol amiright?\u201d Which I don\u2019t see as an issue, because that\u2019s just factual?

Being incredibly academic probably masked his need for support in other areas.", "My take on this was:  Here you have a man, who is really used to being waited on, because he has been his whole life.  Since he's been waited on his whole life, he was able to focus on and succeed in a career.  The way men were traditionally always allowed to do. No second shift or emotional labor.\n\nIOW, classic misogyny.\n\nAnd ableism.  ND people CAN learn basic ADLs. (Which, today, includes a whole mess of phone apps, like Uber.)
