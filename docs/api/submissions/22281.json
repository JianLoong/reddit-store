You talk about you being compared to him by other people, but then in a tipsy state you put him down to these people...You think this makes you a good person?  So career wise/school wise your brother is really accomplished but in real life/hands on things not so....you are the reverse?  who is to say which life is the right one?  Or who is the better person?  Your brother didn't betray you to family, but you did so to him, and I don't see what he ever did to deserve that.  Next time grow a pair and tell the AHs that are comparing you to him that they are AHs without attacking someone that didn't do anything.", "Almost everyone is an AH. \n\nYour parents are for enabling your brother\u2019s perfectionist overachiever behavior throughout your childhoods to the point where he isn\u2019t functional along with disregarding your career choices and discounting you. \n\nYou are the ah for pointing it out to extended family at a party. I\u2019m sure your brother is aware of his shortcomings but if you had a problem with it, you should have talked to him. \n\nYou also sound jealous of how your parents treat him and you may want to explore some of those issues with a professional.

How, when, where and to whom you said it maks you TA. \n\nDo you dislike you brother because he was treated differently? If so, it is misguided and should be focused on your parents.", "ESH. I can see why being compared to your sibling as a way to put you down for your entire life would make you feel frustrated and resentful. As awful as that is, it does not excuse you airing out all of his flaws, things that most people would be embarrassed about, to family members.", "YTA.  What you describe is not a person who needs to try harder to 'learn real things'.  What you describe is a neurodiverse person who is really good at some things (And seems to have found an amazing way to contribute to his community) but struggles with some daily skills and executive functioning.   Rather than be proud of your brother for his accomplishments, you come across as petty, jealous, and incredibly immature.  You owe your brother an apology, and then you need to take a step back and look at all the things your brother does well so that you can hopefully see him for the hard-working person he is.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you think your brother needs a wake-up call, speak to him and support. What you did was bitch behind his back, not necessary!", "NTA\n\nLmao, and here was thinking you'd said something rude. But no, I got to the bottom and all you said was an adult, a 34 YEAR OLD MAN, doesn't know how to call an Uber or use a shoehorn. That's a level of incompetence that is actually concerning. I would be humiliated if I was that bad at being an adult too, but that's nothing to do with you.\n\nYour brother needs thicker skin and your family needs to kindly pull the sticks out of their asses.", "YTA - I would never talk bad about my sibling to my extended family. It also sounds like you have a little bit of resentment towards your brother. Bringing up stuff from 4 years ago is ridiculous, let it go. Also calling him \u201cuseless\u201d is rude and another indicator of your resentment. \n\nIt does sound like your extended family needs to mind their business though.", "Nta your brother sounds like a useless loser", "NTA the truth hurts", "YTA. The relatives that keep comparing you to your brother are also guilty, but if you have been helping your brother voluntarily you can't expect him to suddenly stop asking you for help with stuff. If you didn't want him to be so dependent, you should have politely and privately confronted him about being more independent instead.", "YTA, he\u2019s your brother, you shouldn\u2019t be slagging him off because he struggles to do things you find easy. I bet you\u2019d struggle to get a doctorate or work in a hospital.\n\nPlayful banter between siblings and family is one thing but from what you\u2019ve written it sounds like you\u2019re quite spiteful/jealous. Your brother is clearly very academic and is in a period of his life where that is the most important thing to him and his career. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll develop these skills as and when he needs them and if not you should be helping him as best you can.", "NAH. Except your parents are the AH for creating this golden child dynamic, academaic achievement isn't everything.", "What you did wasn\u2019t a good thing. However I get why you feel this way. I hate when people compare kids and put someone on the pedestal just because they are successful academically. So the whole family is TA, for making you feel bad all this time, for basically turning your brother useless in every other thing  he will encounter except academics.", "YTA for badmouth your brother behind his back.", "ESH\n\nThere is obviously some insecurity regarding you and him which is fine considering you have been compared to him for a long time. You need to work this out in another manner however. \n\nTrashing him when he isn't even there to defend himself isn't fair to him nor is it to yourself. You can't justify this by saying \"its time to face the harsh truth\" because you didn't even say it to him. You said this to up yourself. Don't do that.\n\nYour parents and relatives suck for pushing the sibling rivalry. They also suck for letting the situation get to the point where the brother is this lacking in common skills. \n\nYou need to get help for this though", "YTA You got drunk and decided to humiliate your brother at a family event because he is different from you. That is not what a good brother does", "Yta.\n\nJust your username makes you look like an AH.", "Is your brother a person with handicap?", "YTA  Your jealousy caused you to humiliate your brother who you know will always now be put down by everyone who was ever compared to him. Love your brother? Don't believe that! Hope he goes NC with you and hires someone to teach him these things because he knows he can't count on you.", "YTA\n\nI understand your frustrations being compared, but it's your extended family doing it. You've had supportive parents and your brother didn't do anything deserving of you humiliating him either. You say you'll be the one he has to rely on one day? Let's hope not for everyone's sake.", "YTA. Disparaging a family member to other family members is usually going to be something to regret. \n\nI hope you understand that if your brother is a physician intensivist, he is literally saving lives and making life and death decisions every single day. And moderating discussions with his patients\u2019 families about these life and death decisions as well. So have some respect. \n\nSo if you\u2019re able to respectfully help your brother, then do so. You might ask him if he wants to have a life partner (spouse) and if so, see if you can help him in any way to find a person who loves him as he is. If not, help him or not, but don\u2019t disrespect him.", "YTA. \n\nYou were tired and frustrated with your brother because of how your parents are and _not_ because your brother did anything to you. \n\nYour frustration was misdirected and I sure hope you feel like a big man and got the validation you have always wanted now that you belittled him publicly. \n\nThis was a conversation that you had to have with your brother privately since obviously your parents are coddling him (unless he has health issues which are making it very difficult to manage day to day tasks and he needs assistance, in which case you are a GIANT AH). Post which you should have brought this up with your parents about how their actions are negatively affecting your brother and you aren\u2019t interested in babying him once they aren\u2019t around to do it.", "OP is still the AH but claiming neurodivergence here is a stretch. It sounds more like he was the GC and never had to learn life skills.", "I want to upvote this one about  4  million times."]}
