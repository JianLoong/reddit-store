We decided to put together a girls' vacation.  Once we agreed on dates and a location, we started looking for places to stay.  We all talked about what we wanted (type of location, budget, etc), and I was adamant that I did NOT want to stay at an airbnb.  There are many many reasons I did not want to, but one of the reasons I listed was that I do not go on vacation so that I can do chores, and in this case in particular, I was also going to have to leave early in the morning for my flight home because I had a training meeting at work that I needed to be home in time for.  \n\n\nAfter much discussion, the rest of the group said sorry, in order to meet the rest of the requests and stay in budget for everyone, an airbnb is the only option.  I suggested that I could stay at a nearby hotel and just meet up with them during the day, but apparently that was going to screw up the budget for other folks.  They told me that since I hated the chore side of things, they could take care of all of the chores.  I didn't want to be a jerk about it so I said that I would be willing to put my linens somewhere (washing machine, laundry pile, whatever) and that I would stay on top of washing any cups/dishes/etc that I used.  They all assured me this was plenty and would be no problem for them to do whatever else needed to be done.  \n\n\nThe vacation itself was lovely, we had a lot of fun and laughs, and it was great to hang out.  I did not read the check out cleaning rules because I knew it would piss me off, but I asked what the expectation was for our linens, and one of the ladies said we had to start a load of laundry so I could put my linens in the washer.  \n\n\nI kept my dishes/utensils washed and clean throughout, and I put my linens in the washer on the final morning and headed to the airport when everyone else was just getting up.  I also only threw garbage into the shared kitchen garbage since I know many places ask you to take out the garbage.    \n\n\nI thought all was well, but this morning I had coffee with my best friend, and when I brought up how great I thought things went on the trip, she got a little awkward, and eventually told me that everyone else was angry at me after I left.  I guess there was a lot on the cleaning list and everyone was stressed about getting stuff done before the checkout and their own flights home, and they felt I should have helped with the chores since I was up early.  My best friend, bless her, reminded them that they had all agreed that I didn't need to do any chores and I had taken care of what I said I would, but apparently they said that \"no reasonable person\" would think it was OK and it was very selfish and rude of me to just leave.

Some of the group had more room in their budgets than others, but I agreed to stay so that those whose budgets were tighter wouldn't be struggling.

I can, however, understand why there was frustration that the (apparently) wealthiest one among them not only paid equally to them (thus benefitting from the cheaper-than-a-hotel option even if you'd rather have spent more) but also got out of doing the work that the AirBnB required.  In other words, despite spending what everyone else spent, you got a better \"deal\" than the others, even though they agreed to this.

So whether it was you or someone else, logic is that if you don't all leave at the same time, the first person to leave does get out of doing much of the cleaning simply based on there is nothing to clean.

Airbnb is the asshole. Those cleaning lists are ridiculous, especially with cleaning fees.  You said your piece and they agreed to your terms.

You caved and went to the airbnb for *them*, because they needed you to share the cost.\n\nSounds like they said whatever they needed to bc they wanted you to shoulder some of the cost, but didn't mean it. That's on them.\n\nOnly time I stay in an airbnb is if I'm taking my parents along, bc cooking is my mom's love language and she would be miserable if she couldn't fix some of the meals.

It\u2019s super bizarre they had an issue with this, unless you personally left a massive mess behind.\n\nI think it\u2019s weird you brought it up in the first place. You could have said nothing, cleaned up after yourself, and simply said \u201cI\u2019m leaving early tomorrow morning, sorry I can\u2019t help with the clean up.\u201d But I also understand why you would prefer a hotel.

Last July, I got a request from said daughter to check out a recently vacated unit because the cleaning person wouldn\u2019t be available for a few days.

This person never aimed for the trash can in the bathroom, and the kitchen trash was overflowing. \nGranted, they\u2019re paying a cleaning fee\u2026but this Boomer would NEVER EVER envision leaving a rental in that condition. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m from a \u201cleave the place better than you found it\u201d generation\u2026but that was just gross.", "I'm a reasonable person and I would have expected you to do exactly what we'd agreed to.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou were clear on what you would do and your friends were happy with that.  They didn't want to each pay extra if you weren't helping pay for the airbnb so this was their cost.  \n\nThe cleaning expectations were likely on the website and they would've known what was needed so they can't play dumb.\n\nThey are just upset you stuck to your rules and didn't give him.\n\nGood on your best friend for sticking up for you.  And yeah I wouldn't be staying at another Airbnb with them.  Hotel or nothing.", "NTA.\n\nThere's a lot of reasons I prefer hotels to AbnB, and this experience of yours is a great example of why.", "Yeah, It's completely understandable that you don't wanna do chores when on VACATION and you set these boundaries at the very start. NTA", "I did not read the check out cleaning rules because I knew it would piss me off\n\n\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nNo, you are not an asshole", "Technically NTA but honestly, the classier move would be to insist on staying at a hotel or help out. Manipulating everyone into doing the chores while you leave Willy nilly is rather selfish. Unless you paid more than everyone, you should do an equal share in the work.", "op=nta\n\nYou saved THEIR budget by going to the AIRbnb--they agreed to your terms which you fulfilled.\n\nThey need to get over themselves, but next time tell them No!  if you are still friends(they get over their pouting tantrums) and do another trip like this.  Stick to your guns that you will get a hotel room and they need to deal with their budgets themselves.", "NTA.  You told them in advance you didn't want to stay in a AirBnb & were unwilling to do chores if they made the decision to stay in one. \n\nThe \"friends\" are the AHs for their unrealistic expectations, when you had already told them you would not participate in cleanup.", "Obviously NTA.  You said you wouldn't clean and now they have shocked Pikachu face on.....\n\nAlso you woke up early to leave esrlier for work..... not to clean. Holy cow. These people have issues.", "An anti- AirBnB post. I like it! NTA", "Exactly! Never have, never will. Same with door dash and all these other things that involve non-employees. Not interested in food missing, spit in, cold, whatever. I don't trust people, especially seeing someone's disgusting car where my food would be, etc. I was on my way to work a few years ago and an Uber driver made a simple mistake and caused a woman her LIFE. F all of it!", "That\u2019s on them, not OP. Op was as straight forward as can be. The others were *hoping* she wasn\u2019t serious. They could have been just as up front as OP. NTA.", "No, it was awkward because the rest of the group thought they could shame or guilt OP into helping when they explicitly agreed that she wouldn\u2019t have to.\n\nDon\u2019t agree to terms and conditions that you are not comfortable with.", "Don\u2019t a lot of air bnbs also charge a cleaning fee even with the chore list?", "This. They're incredibly immature. I can't think of anyone in my life who would, weeks later, defend the idea that I should have know better than to take them at their word. I don't fuck with that level of chaos.", "I'm wondering how much cleaning needed to be done to be stressful? As in if you cleaned up after yourself as you went, washed your shit. At most you might have to run the vacuum, make the bed and wipe surfaces down. Oh and take out the trash. \n\nI have a big house and can do that all on my own. But if we have people over and no one cleans up after themselves it can take ages. I'm guessing they weren't as mindful of making mess as OP was and got the shits about doing everything OP had done during the trip on the last day.", "It is almost always cheaper to stay at a hotel. And it's just a better experience overall.\n\nAirBnB's are nice for larger groups, but even then I prefer the hotel.", "Absolutely. I'd never choose an AirBnB, they have evolved into something which isn't my idea of a holiday.", "It\u2019s like Ticketmaster. Real ticket. Fee. E ticket also fee.", "Exactly this. The last Airbnb I stayed in sent the list of chores by text at 8pm on my final night. None of them had been mentioned earlier. (I have no issue with cleaning used plates etc., but I draw the line at laundry and cleaning toilets.)\n\nAnd it's not like hotels are even more expensive in some places.", "Yep, but cleaning fees that are non inclusive of certain chores are for tax purposes. If they do laundry for you, it's a hotel according to tax laws in certain places. By making you do linens, and then having a cleaning service do the rest, they circumvent extra taxation.", "Oh hell no.", "This is the wild part to me! Every trip I\u2019ve gone on in the past few years, I\u2019ve checked AirBNB just for the giggles, and it\u2019s always either the same or more expensive as staying in a hotel plus with a bunch of moronic rules and requirements on top of it. I don\u2019t understand why anyone uses it.", "My parents have done AirBnb and had decent experiences, but even if it's genuinely cheaper I'd prefer the hotel, partly because I find the experience of staying in a stranger's home to be anxiety inducing. I stayed at a hostel for a few days to attend a wedding, it felt like I was barging into someone's living room and putting my feet on the coffee table before I'd even said hello.", "After reading all the stuff on the sub Reddit, there is no way I would do Airbnb\u2026 There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to pay a cleaning fee and then clean the place as well.", "Yup. I don't know the last time I saw an airbnb where the owner actually lived (or ever lived) in the home.\n\nThe last one I stayed in was basically a slum, and when I looked at what else the owners has posted on airbnb, it was a slew of luxury properties up and down the East coast.", "Lack of planning on their part does not constitute an emergency on your part.\n\nBesides, maybe I'm weird, but I pack the night before and only have out the stuff I'll wear / use the next morning."]}
