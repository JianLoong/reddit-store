We decided to put together a girls' vacation.  Once we agreed on dates and a location, we started looking for places to stay.  We all talked about what we wanted (type of location, budget, etc), and I was adamant that I did NOT want to stay at an airbnb.  There are many many reasons I did not want to, but one of the reasons I listed was that I do not go on vacation so that I can do chores, and in this case in particular, I was also going to have to leave early in the morning for my flight home because I had a training meeting at work that I needed to be home in time for.  \n\n\nAfter much discussion, the rest of the group said sorry, in order to meet the rest of the requests and stay in budget for everyone, an airbnb is the only option.  I suggested that I could stay at a nearby hotel and just meet up with them during the day, but apparently that was going to screw up the budget for other folks.  They told me that since I hated the chore side of things, they could take care of all of the chores.  I didn't want to be a jerk about it so I said that I would be willing to put my linens somewhere (washing machine, laundry pile, whatever) and that I would stay on top of washing any cups/dishes/etc that I used.  They all assured me this was plenty and would be no problem for them to do whatever else needed to be done.  \n\n\nThe vacation itself was lovely, we had a lot of fun and laughs, and it was great to hang out.  I did not read the check out cleaning rules because I knew it would piss me off, but I asked what the expectation was for our linens, and one of the ladies said we had to start a load of laundry so I could put my linens in the washer.  \n\n\nI kept my dishes/utensils washed and clean throughout, and I put my linens in the washer on the final morning and headed to the airport when everyone else was just getting up.  I also only threw garbage into the shared kitchen garbage since I know many places ask you to take out the garbage.    \n\n\nI thought all was well, but this morning I had coffee with my best friend, and when I brought up how great I thought things went on the trip, she got a little awkward, and eventually told me that everyone else was angry at me after I left.  I guess there was a lot on the cleaning list and everyone was stressed about getting stuff done before the checkout and their own flights home, and they felt I should have helped with the chores since I was up early.  My best friend, bless her, reminded them that they had all agreed that I didn't need to do any chores and I had taken care of what I said I would, but apparently they said that \"no reasonable person\" would think it was OK and it was very selfish and rude of me to just leave.  I've already decided that if there's another trip I won't be going unless we're at a hotel, but I'd still like to know, AITA?", "created_utc": 1695489760, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16qa28f/aita_for_not_helping_with_chores_at_the_airbnb/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They try to blame you for their poor planning.", "NTA - This is ridiculous. You were very clear with them from the beginning regarding your concerns about chores on vacation, especially considering your limited schedule. You even offered to stay elsewhere, but a specific compromise was reached so they could have things their way.\n\nNow they\u2019re angry because it looks like you had a point regarding the chores and the sting of consequences to their decisions makes them want to lash out on the one person who had the forethought to call it. \n\nIf they were so concerned about the number of required chores, they should\u2019ve gotten up with you rather than laying in bed, expecting you to read their minds, take pity, and risk making yourself late & stressing yourself out by doing more than agreed. Some friends.", "NTA.  AirBnB host cleaning requests have gotten absolutely ridiculous and then they usually add a cleaning charge on top of it.\n\nYou told your friends you had to leave early and that you'd put your linens where they needed to go and wash your own dishes.

If they had done, maybe they wouldn't have been so rushed and stressed. Done some the night before, or  They could have even asked you (nicely) to add a job to your list.", "NTA. And exactly why I won\u2019t stay in an air BNB", "NTA. You did everything you agreed to.\n\nThey don't get to justifiably feel butt-hurt about what they explicitly agreed to.\n\nNext time, don't cave about the hotel room; they can't be trusted to gracefully abide by an agreement.", "NTA.

You are the asshole. I get that you would have preferred a chore-free hotel, but that wouldn't work for everybody so the best option was the AirBnB.  Since you are a member of the group with no special status or needs, you should either have stayed home, or pitched in. Asking for special privileges was very entitled. You could have done a bit more of the duties before the last day to compensate for the fact you couldn't do much the last morning. It's hard to believe there was really that much for each of you to do, with x adults to share the work.", "It goes both ways.   While yes they did agree to your rules and I understand why you did that. Vacation should be more about relaxing TO SOME. Others enjoy camping which is very tedious and a working style vacation.    \nWhile you didn\u2019t need to help. Helping your friends out as a group would have shown that you cared about your friends you stay with.  You sound kind of like the snob of the group    Higher budgeting place.  Wanting to stay alone just so you doing have to clean.  While your not wrong.  It appears you may be hanging out with people that week that you really aren\u2019t friends with but so enjoy going out with once in a while     If you were sitting there while they were cleaning in front of you.

I don't know where you get the idea that I'm a 'snob' - it would have cost me about the same to stay at a hotel as it did to stay at the air bnb, it just would have been more costly for the others as it would have changed the split.  Some of the group had more room in their budgets than others, but I agreed to stay so that those whose budgets were tighter wouldn't be struggling.  I was not sitting there while they were cleaning in front of me - as I said, I left for the airport just as they were getting up.
