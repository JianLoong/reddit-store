We decided to put together a girls' vacation.  Once we agreed on dates and a location, we started looking for places to stay.  We all talked about what we wanted (type of location, budget, etc), and I was adamant that I did NOT want to stay at an airbnb.  There are many many reasons I did not want to, but one of the reasons I listed was that I do not go on vacation so that I can do chores, and in this case in particular, I was also going to have to leave early in the morning for my flight home because I had a training meeting at work that I needed to be home in time for.  \n\n\nAfter much discussion, the rest of the group said sorry, in order to meet the rest of the requests and stay in budget for everyone, an airbnb is the only option.  I suggested that I could stay at a nearby hotel and just meet up with them during the day, but apparently that was going to screw up the budget for other folks.  They told me that since I hated the chore side of things, they could take care of all of the chores.  I didn't want to be a jerk about it so I said that I would be willing to put my linens somewhere (washing machine, laundry pile, whatever) and that I would stay on top of washing any cups/dishes/etc that I used.  They all assured me this was plenty and would be no problem for them to do whatever else needed to be done.  \n\n\nThe vacation itself was lovely, we had a lot of fun and laughs, and it was great to hang out.  I did not read the check out cleaning rules because I knew it would piss me off, but I asked what the expectation was for our linens, and one of the ladies said we had to start a load of laundry so I could put my linens in the washer.  \n\n\nI kept my dishes/utensils washed and clean throughout, and I put my linens in the washer on the final morning and headed to the airport when everyone else was just getting up.  I also only threw garbage into the shared kitchen garbage since I know many places ask you to take out the garbage.    \n\n\nI thought all was well, but this morning I had coffee with my best friend, and when I brought up how great I thought things went on the trip, she got a little awkward, and eventually told me that everyone else was angry at me after I left.  I guess there was a lot on the cleaning list and everyone was stressed about getting stuff done before the checkout and their own flights home, and they felt I should have helped with the chores since I was up early.  My best friend, bless her, reminded them that they had all agreed that I didn't need to do any chores and I had taken care of what I said I would, but apparently they said that \"no reasonable person\" would think it was OK and it was very selfish and rude of me to just leave.  I've already decided that if there's another trip I won't be going unless we're at a hotel, but I'd still like to know, AITA?", "created_utc": 1695489760, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16qa28f/aita_for_not_helping_with_chores_at_the_airbnb/", "score": 343, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't know where you get the idea that I'm a 'snob' - it would have cost me about the same to stay at a hotel as it did to stay at the air bnb, it just would have been more costly for the others as it would have changed the split.  Some of the group had more room in their budgets than others, but I agreed to stay so that those whose budgets were tighter wouldn't be struggling.  I was not sitting there while they were cleaning in front of me - as I said, I left for the airport just as they were getting up.

They are jerks.", "NTA, I refuse to stay in an Airbnb because I don't want to do chores on vacation.  I stayed at a Wyndham resort once. When I checked in they told me I had to throw out the garbage out and pat the dishes in the dishwasher and turn it on.  I was ok with the dishwasher but you throw the garbage out I don't want to do that.  Hotels are the best.", "NTA. You made it clear. They agreed to it.

Didn't you pay a cleaning fee for that?", "NTA - You said you weren't going to help and you didn't. I'm genuinely curious to know what the list was that was so stressful.  Anyplace I've stayed at was just put all your trash in the bin in the back and take all your food unless it's unopened.", "NTA. You made an agreement and held up your end of it - imagine that!\n\nYou offered to stay at a hotel, but your friends said they needed your money, so you told them your terms for an Airbnb stay- which was fine with them until a moment they didn\u2019t like came. Those friends need to grow up and realize they can\u2019t have it both way.", "NTA. You said no chores; they took that on by insisting on the airbnb and agreeing you could fo limited chores. \n\nThey also failed to factor in the time and stress to get the chores done v departure times and weren't prepared.\n\nI wouldn't want to travel like that. I like jotels gor a reason.", "NTA, obviously, and your friend group is toxic.\n\nYou were extremely clear. They agreed and assured you it was all good.

They made their bed, they can wash the linens.", "NTA And what kind of cleaning rules were there?  Most I stay in it's just strip the beds, start the dishwasher, and maybe take out the garbage.

A big part of the fun of a trip is all staying together so saying you\u2019d rather go stay off at a hotel separately just because you don\u2019t want to take some garbage out and do some chores is weird to me IMO. I would have tried to do my share the night before, before heading out early for work.", "NTA, but if I'd been in the friend group, I'd have said \"Okay, in lieu of chores, you pay $20 or $50 more a night than the rest of us do\" or whatever.\n\nYou are NTA because you'd all agreed on this earlier.  I can, however, understand why there was frustration that the (apparently) wealthiest one among them not only paid equally to them (thus benefitting from the cheaper-than-a-hotel option even if you'd rather have spent more) but also got out of doing the work that the AirBnB required.  In other words, despite spending what everyone else spent, you got a better \"deal\" than the others, even though they agreed to this.  Of course when they had to face this during a stressful moment, they were irritated.\n\nThe easier answer would've been asking that you throw a bit more money at it to solve the problem of natural resentment.", "YTA. Do you want to be right or do you want to be friends? I would think if these are lifelong girlfriends you would figure it out together, and contribute together.

THEY offered to not have me do chores, and I offered what (not knowing what the chore list would be) seemed like a reasonable compromise.", "It's ridiculous. Last year I stayed in an Airbnb where I had to do most of the cleaning on top of paying an exorbitant $150 cleaning fee.", "All the ones I've stayed at are pretty straightforward and easy clean up. Owners are required to use a cleaning service but I'm guessing if they pay the service by the house then they are pushing for the guests to do more so the cleaning crew does less.", "I\u2019m so curious about the chores, what else is needed besides making sure the dishes are clean, the trash it out and maybe piling up the linens?", "I'm thinking that whoever leaves first automatically gets out of most cleaning because everyone else is still in the house. So whether it was you or someone else, logic is that if you don't all leave at the same time, the first person to leave does get out of doing much of the cleaning simply based on there is nothing to clean. So OP can't start laundry or run the dishwasher or take out the trash because there are still others in the house. So they'd probably be upset with WHOEVER left first.", "They're not required to use a cleaning service, they can 100% do all the cleaning themselves.

With there being a bunch of us, i'm sure someone was running around saying 'did you put your linens in the wash yet?  did someone get the garbage? is everyone's dishes in the dishwasher?' and everyone was just stressed about getting it all done before they had to leave.", "NTA.  You said you didn't want to stay at an AirBnB, because of the chores.  They said they'd take care of it.  You did the chores you said you would.  You did nothing that wasn't agreed on.

I was wondering if they had to mop or something lol\n\nNTA", "Next time perhaps assign one person per chore? So you are in charge of collecting all the dishes, someone else is in charge of linens, someone else checks all the trash, etc."]}
