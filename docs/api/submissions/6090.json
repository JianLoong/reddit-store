She would always throw in my face that my father wasnt around saying things like \"I didn't have to keep you but I did\" \"I could've given you up to the state like my mom did to me\" \"your father didn't want you but I kept you and you disrespect me\" etc. She also would say things to me like \"if you werent so fat you'd have clothes to wear\" while I was on my bedroom floor crying because I couldn't find an outfit to wear \"you have no friends because you are such a bitch\" \"you will never find someone to love you because you don't take care of yourself\" I was also expected to clean the house, her room, make her bed, take care of all the animals we had including cleaning the cages of our small animals, taking the dogs to the bathroom and feeding them, grooming the cats and scooping their litter box, cooking meals, making sure she ate and had a cold drink before she went to bed, etc. After I graduated high school she guilt tripped me into not going to college so I could get a job and help pay the bills. Once I did get a job she would take almost my whole check except for $20-$40 to \"pay bills\", fill her tank and get herself food that I couldnt touch. I say \"pay bills\" the way I did because after putting the utilities in my name she let the bill wrack up to over $3000 which is now in collections and ruining my credit score\n\nWhen I decided to move out at age 22 she flipped saying I was turning my back on her, how would she pay the bills without me, I will fail in be homeless crawling back to her in a year, she hopes where I move burns down with me inside, etc.\n\nAfter I moved out she would constantly text me to berate me or ask for money, or tell me that her life is falling apart and its my fault because I moved out and abandoned her.\n\nRecently she got evicted from her apartment due to back rent, before she got evicted I sent her easy jobs to get her back on her feet and cheaper apartments to help her out. She instead just kept saying she was gonna be homeless and asking for her and her 2 dogs to move into my spare bedroom/office for free.\n\nI know if I were to let her move in she wouldnt respect any boundaries and it would be just like it was when I lived with her, and that she wouldnt leave but I still feel guilty.\n\nShe recently messaged me saying that she and her 2 dogs are still living out of a uhaul and asked for money.  The problem is that shes lied and manipulated me so many times before that I dont know if I believe her\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nUpdate: Im just so torn because I keep hearing that you only get 1 mom, and while I know that is true, mentally I cant do it anymore\n\nUpdate: part of my issue with her is finding out that my dad did want a relationship with me, my mom hid our location from him and would tell him at times that I didn't want to see or talk to him even though I did. I just didn't know that she was doing this", "created_utc": 1672479853, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zzqhem/aita_for_not_letting_my_mom_move_in_with_my/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If someone isn\u2019t respecting your boundaries or is making your life/mental health hell, then you have NO obligation to them. Family or not. You have to do what you feel is right for you. She made her bed, let her lie in it. Actions have consequences and karma\u2019s a bitch. You\u2019re NTA. I understand you may feel like you are, but trust me, you aren\u2019t.", "Oh, honey. No. You are definitely, without a doubt, NTA. You don't owe your mom a damn thing.", "NTA. you've been conditioned to feel this way by her. it's totally up to you wether or not you decide to help her again, but the main thing is that you're NTA no matter how you decide to do things.", "NTA. Don't let her into your home. I hate when abusive parents uses the excuse \"I gave birth to you so you better be grateful and do whatever I want\". Like, \"B, I didn't ask. You birthed me to abuse me.,  so no, I'm not gonna be grateful, D*** B\"", "NTA. You know once she\u2019s there, she will never leave. She will just continue to make you as miserable as she can.\nWhere are your 3 brothers in all this?", "NTA\n\nSounds like you tried to help her help herself and she refused that and instead wants to mooch off you.  \n\nShe also sounds like she'd majorly destroy your mental health if she moved in with you.", "NTA and I am so, so sorry you're going through this. I understand how hard it is for you because even if you don't want it, that desire to be loved by and have approval from even terrible parents can be POWERFUL. \n\nBut she made your childhood and your past terrible. If history holds true (and I think you believe it will be), she'll make your future terrible too. \n\nDon't you owe it to yourself to build a beautiful future for yourself? To your husband and the life you can create for yourselves? \n\nYour mom had her chance, and she didn't take it. She ruined it for herself and your siblings. You couldn't do anything about it before because you were too young. But now you can. \n\nDon't let her take your new chance too.", "100% NTA! You deserve to be able to get on with your life. She sounds very manipulative. You don't owe her anything,  you've gone above and beyond and now it's time to live your life.", "NTA. You left an abuser, don't let the abuser come back in your life. You have indeed only one mom, she did not nurture you. To love her from afar is very good for your mental health. She used you a long time and still has some serious ways to manipulate you. She misses her servant and scapegoat. Sorry, but you need to protect yrself.", "NTA. But atleast try to get the dogs via the animal shelter or something. They can\u2019t live on the streets because of your moms actions.", "NTA keeping toxic people out of your life is SMART and she is hella toxic\n\nDid it myself 22 years ago with my own abusive mother a d was the best decision I have ever made\n\nOP go live your life, your mother is responsible for her own life, you are not her partner, not her co-parent \n\nYou broke free, dont get trapped again\n\nIts easy for people to say wah wah she is your mother, but they didnt have to live with her abuse, its pure ignorance\n\nI always say I miss having a mom, but i do NOT miss mine and i dont love her either and thats ok too", "NTA and under no circumstances should you let that woman in your home, unless you really think she would leave. A mother is someone who cares and nurtures their children. She was not that. Not to mention letting her move in will only enable her to continue to be a burden and not take care of herself. Don't fall for it. Her eviction is not your fault", "NTA. And you wouldn't be an AH for cutting her off completely. As for having only one mum, well that is true, but if she is like that, it is a good thing. You do you! You don't owe this monster anything at all!", "NTA she played stupid games now she is getting stupid prizes.", "Nta. You have helped her more than she deserves. You have other siblings. She can ask them. I'm currently NC with my mother. It's ok to say No, it's ok to put up boundaries. You said she managed as a single mom..she will figure it out again", "NTA I don't understand why people are pushing you to support her. You reap what you sew. She's mean and manipulative. You are advocating for yourself. Stay strong and go with your gut feeling. Be honest with her about why you won't take her in. Stay strong. Happy New Year.", "NTA you're being smart and being low or no contact with toxic abusive users and losers. we do not have to take.  just because there's a genetic component in your relationship doesn't mean you need to stand for that. I am glad that you stand up for yourself and that you have little to no contact with this person. Next time you hear from her ask her to reach out to her other children. And since you know she's felt at Liberty to put bills in the past in your name please make sure that you secure your name banking information and put your things on alert right now in case you get her trying to put everything in your name again. Good luck to you. In case you haven't heard of it there's a great method out there called gray rock that's very helpful when dealing with contact from people that you have put into the low contact for many reasons.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry your mother has been so abusive to you. Do not let her move in with you. Maintain your boundaries.", "NTA.\n\nShe\u2019s an abuser, do not let her move in with you. And so what if you only get \u2018one\u2019 mother? If that one isn\u2019t a good one? Then you don\u2019t have to have a relationship with her", "NTA and you should block her. She is an awful person.\nFind your peace without her", "Oh hell no.  Do NOT let this woman horn into your home and wreck it.  Because that\u2019s what she will do.  STAY STRONG and just say NO..  and quit sending her suggestions because that just makes you \u201cown\u201d the problem.  You don\u2019t.  This one is all hers.", "NTa she put a 3000 dollar debt onto her own kid, that is not a parent, that is a parasite.

You\u2019ve already gotten a lot of great input, but also remember that you\u2019re not stuck with her as your mom. The great thing about life as an adult is that we can choose our family members more freely. Your biological mother never treated you like a mother should. But there are plenty of people out there who you may find and have in your life who can and want to give you that motherly love and care that you\u2019ve missed out on.\n\nDon\u2019t waste your life away on a person who\u2019s spent your entire life abusing you.

Your mom is one of those moms. DO NOT let her in. You got free of her grip. Now stay that way. And honestly, you'd be better off blocking her.", "NTA\nI believe family helps each other when they deserve it. Your mom sounds like she doesn\u2019t. She abused you, manipulated you, ruined your credit score, and guilted you. She would be a leech that would never leave if you let her into your home. You\u2019ve finally escaped. Stay that way.", "NTA. You know your mother well enough to know that if you ever let her into your home, you\u2019d have one hell of a time getting her out. Those people intoning sanctimoniously \u201cYou only have one mother,\u201d implying you should take her in, support her financially etc. are either brainwashed tools or lack the imagination to comprehend what an abusive user a mother can be.   In a comment you say she uses as an excuse that \u2018she didn\u2019t have a role model,\u2019 well, OP, you can be a role model for her. You pay your bills, you maintain partner relationship, you are managing your life including dealing with her screwing you over  financially and running up debts in your name. You are no longer that inexperienced 18 year old that she can bully into damaging your opportunities for own greed and entitlement. Lastly, your mother is only 43 and that is too damned young for her to plop herself on your sofa and demand you to \u201ctake care of her\u201d for the next 40 years.", "NTA. And where are your brothers in all this?!", "NTA at all.\n\nYour mother is a narcissistic, manipulative, gaslighter and has abused you and triangulated you with your brothers.\n\nShe can reap what she sowed.  You owe her nothing.  Just because she may have birthed you doesn't mean that she's allowed to abuse you.\n\nNever, ever let her move into your house.  You will never get her and her dogs out.

Continuing a relationship just because someone is a blood family member is not healthy when they are and have always been so abusive. They are an adult you are not responsible for them. You could send them information about shelters and other support that exists. She also had 3 other kids to ask for help. \n\nA lot of us have chosen family because of abusive families and it's so much more fulfilling and valuable.", "Nta. Don't let her into ur house. U know better. U really do. U can't help someone if they don't want help and u gave her job applications and cheap apt applications. What else could u do? Where are ur brothers?

You would not allow others in your life to treat you this way, why should your egg donor get a pass?? You have been remarkably kind in attempting to help her. But this is an instance of not setting yourself on fire to keep others warm. Be kind to yourself. She is an adult and is capable of solving her own issues. She chooses to manipulate.

Youll be so glad you did.", "No she doesnt owe them anything, these animals are innocent though and if OP wants to it would be kind to see if she can help the dogs and ONLY the dogs", "I know", "Yeah that sounds really tough. All the more reason to keep a distance.

No one, but you, can judge how much you are willing/able to put up with. Only you can protect yourself, your husband and any children you may have from her abuses. It's ok to go no contact. Estrangements are never easy, but sometimes are necessary for our own well-being.", "I\u2019m so happy to hear that, that\u2019s how you deserve to be treated. \n\nBlock your biomom, cut her out of your life. You\u2019ve done all you can to help her, she\u2019s just gonna wear you out and drag you down with her if you keep letting her contact you."]}
