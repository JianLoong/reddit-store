In a comment you say she uses as an excuse that \u2018she didn\u2019t have a role model,\u2019 well, OP, you can be a role model for her.

She pretty much implanted herself in every aspect of his life including the aspect of his life where he goes and hangs out with his friends and when they lived together he was paying basically 90% of all of the bills and not saving anything at all and yet she was still behind on bills.  This is how bad parents use their kids, because it's easy for a narcissistic parent to make a good child feel bad about not taking care of them because that's what we're taught to do is that we should take care of our parents when they get older.  \n\nThe reality of the situation is you can't take care of her if she's not willing to take care of herself, and you definitely should not let her make you feel any other way because her prerogative is to keep you paying her bills she doesn't care about your future, she doesn't care about whether or not you're saving for your future especially since she's already put you into debt.", "NTA don\u2019t do it.

Never ever ever let her into your life again. NTA.", "Your mom reminds me of my mom.\n\nFirstly: look into therapy for emotional abuse. You need help learning how to set and enforce reasonable boundaries. I've been there and am still going through the process.\n\nI would say NTA.\n\nAlso, I'd advise you to take stock of what your mom is able to give you in a relationship and ask if that's enough. You cannot change her, change has to come from within. For me, that means (among other things) accepting that I'll always be an afterthought to my parents now that I'm not around to be their beast of burden. It also means accepting that when I visit them they'll try to offload a lot of chores and household emotional and physical labour to me. For the time being, there's enough in the + column for me with my folks that I don't feel the need to go completely NC, and going LC instead has been my compromise. I do care about them, for all their flaws. \n\nWhat helped me a lot is realizing this: I cannot control my parents or make them change. I can only choose how I act and what I accept. So I can choose to do the chores and babysitting and cooking they assign and play the old role, or I can choose not to and understand that may cut the visit short. That doesn't mean their behaviour doesn't hurt, but it gives *me* the power to decide what treatment I accept. We teach others how to treat us - oftentimes our abusers will continue to behave abusively towards us even after they no longer have power because we enable their behaviour with our own. \n\nSo, for example: when I first went away to university I would always come back during holidays and summer break. I found it really frustrating because when I went home I'd end up back in the old dysfunctional patterns: I'd be saddled with unreasonable amounts of chores and my freedom of movement and shelter would be restricted by my parents to control me - and I'm not talking a reasonable boundary like \"don't use my car, I need it\" I'm talking trying to ground your adult child to their room because they refuse to be late to work because you've decided the windows need a clean right now, or threatening to thow your child out of the house for refusing to take the blame for something they didn't do or wanting to have breakfast before mowing the lawn or not wanting to cancel plans I'd had for a month day-of because their golden child didn't study for an exam and God forbid she face a single solitary consequence of her own decisions so obviously their straight A older sibling is going to forego a special friends' night out for emergency tutoring - and perform being happy about it because compliance isn't enough, I also have to be cheerful about it. \n\nMy parents would also sabotage my personal and professional life - making me late to work, engineering that we'd show up just barely late to the inter-city bus I took to get back to school (and home after I graduated and stayed in the city I went to school in), manufacturing crises that ever so conveniently meant I had to flake out on friends at the last minute, etc. \n\nWhen I decided I'd had enough of that pattern about 10years ago, I did 3 things:\n\n1. I reduced the frequency and duration of my visits so I could afford items 2 and 3.\n\n2. I started renting hotel rooms when I visit.\n\n3. I started driving a car (rental at first and then my own once I could afford it) instead of relying on them for transportation to the inter-city bus depot (an hour away by car from the rural area they live in, public transportation wasn't an option).  \n\nThis did 2 important things: It gave me unconditional safe shelter and it gave me control over when the visit ended. \n\nNow they can't jerk me around about my ride to the inter city bus with some stupid power game (my mother *loved* to \"accidentally\" be late to the bus departure so I'd be forced to stay an extra few days with no regards to the impact on my school or job) or threaten to turn me out in the cold if I don't comply.\n\nMy parents are still their controlling, manipulative and authoritarian selves. I can't make them change that. But what I *can* do now is say, \"ok, I'll go back to the hotel, then. Good night.\" If they make an unreasonable demand and try to threaten to throw me out if I don't comply. In short: I make sure the highway is a viable option if I'm told my way or the highway. They do still make unreasonable demands because they are who they are. But they've learned that if they don't accept a no from me, I will leave instead of folding. This isn't to say that I don't do anything they ask - but more that if I've been on my feet all goddamn day and I'm tired I will say I need a break. \n\nAn interesting side effect of this is that after many years of this, my parents reduced the frequency and intensity of their demands on me when I visit. I think if they were to tell it they'd claim they never know when I'm going to make a federal case out of it (they are both not self aware and incapable of being accountable for their own role in disagreements), but eventually we settled out into a fairly reasonable amount of demands placed on me during visits for the most part. Once every 2 years or so they'll push the boundary again and I'll need to cut a visit short again, or they'll agitate for me to stay with them and I'll make plain the condition of me visiting is I stay in a hotel, but they seem to have mostly learned where my limits are and usually the limits are observed (even if they'll make passive aggressive comments or snide remarks about them). \n\nThat doesn't mean their behaviour doesn't hurt, but it does mean that I am the one choosing how much hurt I accept and if a visit is worth it to me. \n\nYou've done a great job enforcing the boundary that you will live separately from her, and you have the power to choose the treatment you accept from her in other ways, too.
