You haven\u2019t done a thing wrong.", "NTA. You dad was a spiteful and incompetent father that gravely abused you as a minor, your feelings are understandable and nobody has the right to judge you for any of that unless they were there for you.", "NTA. Oh OP- I\u2019m so sorry, duckling. First: funerals are for the LIVING - so if going to the funeral didn\u2019t serve you, you have a perfect right not to go. \n\nYour sisters had a different experience of the same person - and it can be hard for people who got the \u2018good\u2019 Dad to empathize with the one who had the \u2018bad\u2019 one. \n\nFind a chosen fam and live your best life. Hugs from this Internet mum!", "NTA\n\nI hope the relationship with your aunt is still ok and you are allowed to stay with her? Your father was an AH to kick out his kid and I assume you've been a minor when he did this? So it was illegal and he had the responsibility to care for you. You have all the rights and reasons not to go to his funeral. And nobody of your relatives helped you when this happened. You have more reasons to be mad and disappointed about their behaviour.", "NTA\n\nAvoiding my bias on the religion part, your father had a duty of care to say the least and throwing out a minor for a mistake is just cruel. \n\nIt must have been difficult emotionally and economically to receive that reaction and  with no reconciliation in 4 years i would imagine your aversion to attend would only increase.\n\nYou have a right to feel how you feel and honestly with 4 years of no contact from your siblings they have no right to try and force your hand.", "NTA.  He failed you as a parent, your thoughts and feelings are completely valid.  The funeral is over and you didn\u2019t go, you should make peace with your choice no matter what anyone else says.", "NTA. He abandoned a dependent child. He died as a father to you that day. You simply didn't go to then burying his physical remains four years later.", "Why is it the vilest people suddenly become saints after they are dead? And how is it your family members, who somehow could not voice their support for you when you were kicked out and homeless at 15, are suddenly able to open their yaps to scold you for staying away from the funeral? It's a miracle, y'all! \n\nAnd then to ask you to help pay for the funeral? Nope, I'm sure devout Christian dad would never accept your \"whore\" money. If you were too dirty to be treated like family, then your money must be too dirty too. It's messed up that they even asked.\n\nNTA a million times.", "nta. how old are your sisters? Either they're really naive or just plain dumb. Why would they even think you'd help out with your father's funeral after what he did to you?", "NTA.\n\nI'm so sorry for what you went through.\n\nYour siblings should be more understanding as to why you didn't attend, but you can't change ignorant people's minds. \n\nIt wasn't like you didn't go because you didn't care, you didn't go because of what he did to you, which probably left emotional damage.", "Fuck that AH. And the rest of your family, too. What you're really mourning isn't him. It's what he should've been. It's what you could've had. That's always a loss for people like us. As somebody who came from an abusive family, don't ever look back. Tell them nope, so sorry, you just don't have any money left after having to support yourself after that AH illegally kicked you out as a child. And block the whole damn bunch. NTA", "NTA\n\nFunerals honor the dead, but they are held for the living. If attending his funeral wouldn\u2019t have helped you with your grieving process or given you closure\u2026then you had no reason to go. And that\u2019s okay, you shouldn\u2019t have to do something just to please your sisters or your aunt. It\u2019s not their funeral and it\u2019s not their grief, they don\u2019t get to call the shots on this one.\n\nI know it\u2019s easier said than done but you really shouldn\u2019t feel guilty. Sometimes people have this idea in their head that you\u2019re not allowed to be angry or feel upset with someone who has passed, as if dying automatically erases all the harm they did to you, but that\u2019s not true. Grief is hard and complicated, and you can be both sad about your father dying and still angry at the man who hurt you.\n\nAlso I honestly don\u2019t think it would\u2019ve made a difference to your sisters whether or not you attended his funeral; what they truly wanted was someone they could guilt into lessening the blow on their own finances.", "NTA, I get the impression from your post that your sisters don\u2019t care about you, they just wanted you to share the cost of the funeral. \nAnd what did your father think he was going to see looking at messages between you & your bf anyway, he was possibly looking for a reason to kick off!", "NTA your family behaves textbook like a cult. Anyone on the \"out\" is evil. You did nothing wrong he abused you for years they are just not able to see it or if they are, are downplaying it.", "NTA, your dad was one, though, and all your relatives for not understanding you.\n\nIf you believe in hell, that's where he is for kicking you out. What a weak, sad man he was. I am proud of you taking a stand against his shit and not going to the funeral. He deserves no respect and you should badmouth him every chance you get so no one forgets that he kicked a 15-year old girl out of his home.\n\nYou could've ended up in terrible, terrible situations. \n\nYour father was shit and he is now dead, which he deserved.", "NTA.\n\ni struggle to find words for this kind of stuff since I've been through similar. For me, I believe funerals are good closure whether you liked them or not, but your family shouldn't have tried to pressure you. \n\nIt is my learned suggestion to seek therapy for the stuff you described and find more about who you are and who your father was. For me, I knew my father loved me, even if he struggled to show it. He was a product of a different world, but he still loves me and still will come to my side if I need him to. Many of those in the faith lose sight based on legalism.", "NTA. Your dad abandoned you. In many (all? I'm not sure) states throwing a 15 year old out of their home is abandonment. After that anyone who expects you to have anything to do with him or his funeral needs to pull their head out of their ass.", "NTA.  Your father and your sisters disowned you. \nWhy would you attend his funeral?  And why would you give even $5 towards it?\n\nYour father had a duty of care to you as a minor; he abdicated his parental responsibilities.  He was not a strict Christian and in fact he showed himself not to be a Christian of any sort.\n\nYou are to be congratulated for having resilience and getting to college.  \n\nIf there is anything in the estate, make sure you get your share.\n\nInfo: what happened to your mom?  Is she alive and did she support you at all?", "They are angry and struggling with his death and need someone to point that at. \n\nI do think you need to consider the idea you're not family anymore though, which sucks, he broke you all up, he bullied and brainwashed them. You are NTA, he threw a child out despite his obligations to care for you, he's lucky you didn't sue for child support.", "NTA. Your sisters though? They watched as he threw you out and did nothing to help you for four years. Now they want you to help pay for the funeral? Because I bet that's the real reason they're angry.", "NTA - not at all.\n\nI'm in a similar situation - kicked out at 14 for dating a 'brown'* (Muslim/Lebanese) girl and took years to *somewhat* reconcile.\n\nIn your situation, I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have given a penny.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Which I always thought was ironic. I was raised by my grandparents, who were (for their time) very progressive. Had many black friends. My best friends at school were black, which was quite rare at the time for that generation. So I don't know if it was a race thing, or a religion thing for my (then) Muslim girlfriend.\n\nDoubly ironically - after about a year of dating this girl, who was Muslim in 'name only' (no headscarf, wore makeup, normal clothes, listened to rock/indie/grunge, drank and smoked weed, premarital sex etc) her dad found out she was seeing a white guy, stalked me and threatened to have me killed, and she ghosted me. So that was 'fun'. Saw her randomly on the bus a few years later, and she was properly 'Muslim' - full body covered up with the fabric/scarf stuff (only eyes showingshowing), no makeup, plain nails etc - with a ring on her finger and what looked like a non-mixed baby - she would have just turned 19.\n\nShe went from a normal South London teenager, who was just Persian/brown ethnically, to full on 'repressed Muslim' in less than 3 years. I felt so sorry for her. I didn't expect her to think I was 'the one' (I was just a teenager), but to see that change from what's almost certainly family pressure really made me think about religion and it's place in our society. I still think about her now (I'm early/mid 30s) - I hope she's happy, safe, and healthy - and didn't put her kids through what her dad put her through.", "NTA while what you did was beyond stupid. Come on, you sent a nude while living with a super religious parent. And you texted at the table to get caught. Own that natural consequence. Your father cast you out, you were as dead to him as he is now in the ground. Best to just keep moving on and building a life for yourself. Because really, what has changed?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

My dad was a stern and strict Christian who always was on my sisters and I about our behavior, clothes, friends, etc. It wasn\u2019t that bad, until I had gotten a boyfriend. We were together for almost 8 months when one night he asked me to send him a nude, I trusted him so I did. Later that night at dinner, my phone went off and it was my bf, I started to text him back and I started smiling and laughing from his texts when my dad noticed and snatched my phone from me.\n\nHe started going on about how I shouldn\u2019t be on my phone during dinner, and he started to go through my messages. I already knew what he was going to see and there was nothing I could have done about it, and once he saw the nude he flipped. He asked who I sent it to and I told him my bf of the same age I had been seeing for months, and my dad stormed into my room. He kept calling me a whore and slut-shaming me as he threw out all of my possessions onto our lawn. He was kicking me out. My sisters watched and didn\u2019t even try to defend me as my dad yelled about how I was too much of a whore to live under his roof. \n\nFast forward 4 years later, after years of being in and out of friends\u2019 homes and struggling to stay afloat for myself, I\u2019d convinced my aunt to let me stay with her while I went to community college. I hadn\u2019t been in touch with my sisters or my dad since he had kicked me out, until my aunt told me that my dad had died. I arranged to finally meet up with my sisters, and they told me that our dad had an aneurysm and they wanted me to go to his funeral and help pay for it. I refused and they all insulted and berated me as if he didn\u2019t completely abandon me at 15 and told me to go to hell for sending one nude. \n \nI ended up not going, don\u2019t get me wrong I was definitely affected and sad from my father\u2019s death, but I honestly just did not want to go. My aunt told me that I should have, and my sisters have all blocked me and have yet to visit me, but I don\u2019t think any of them understand how my dad made me feel and what I went through. I am having some doubts now but I still mostly feel that I had a right to not go to or help pay for the man who made my teenage years hell because of one nude\u2019s funeral. Do you think I made the right choice, or did my bitterness just make me seem like an \u201casshole\u201d??\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
