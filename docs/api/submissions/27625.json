My family cooks \"ethnic\" food for her on a regular basis. I say that in quotes because to me, it's just food. Most recently, we made chicken dumplings and rice. Why is that considered \"ethnic\" food? China has a population of, what, one billion? I don't think that a food can be considered \"ethnic\" if an entire population eats it. So... now it's just food. Nourishment, calories, tasty, should-have-candles-scented-like-this, disgusting, divine, etc... all various descriptions of edible items, regardless of the food's \"ethnicity.\" Honest to goodness. The absurdity! \n\nHow about the fact that, as someone with extreme gluten intolerance, I eat lots of corn/rice/potatoes? Do my corn tortillas make my taco-esque meal \"ethnic\" because it's tacos are a \"Mexican\" food? (I'd argue it's a Latin American food, not nmstrixtlu Mexican, but I digress.) I can't afford the gluten-free bread, but I can afford the corn tortillas, so I use those. I end up eating a lot of chicken salad tacos or whatever else. Is that considered to be \"ethnic\" because I put my egg salad into a corn tortilla? Should I be banned from eating thay food as a white woman? Or the rice, which can be found in any Chinese or Mexican restaurant's menu? Does that make rice \"ethnic\" in some way? \n\nYour co-worker's logic is... shall we say... non-existent. Just completely and utterly lacking. If it's edible, enjoyable, and not being shoved down her throat, then she can suck it.

Tonight's soup, last week's grilled burgers, and tomorrow's pot roast are all \"smelly\" and yet probably not problematic to your co-worker.
