People say I'm oversensitive because I feel like its racist that everytime something about Korea comes up he goes out of his way to say \"squid game\" and they don't understand why I think its racist but why is it racist? Because it is so much more than that and you are basing a whole country and culture on just one thing... Making everything Japanese about manga, anime and hentai is also racist...\n\nYou are not K-pop and your culture isn't K-pop and it kind of seems like bullying to act as if all you are is that... \n\nChina is more than rice, Japan is more than manga, Africa is more than wildlife, Germany is more than WW2, America is more than Cowboys... I can't understand why people can't see how it would feel if it was them... She might actually be interested in your culture(even though it is from her interest in K-pop) but she needs to understand that what she is doing isn't okay... If she continues I would tell your teacher that this is something in between racism and bullying and that it needs to stop and it needs to be taken serious because this does harm to people... \n\nIt's kind of like a man that only think of a woman as something that you can reproduce with...

Of course, it isn\u2019t your responsibility to be an educator; if you  think your teacher might understand (although her comments suggest she didn\u2019t get it earlier), she could talk with the girl.  The girl IS at the very least a bit dense, and I\u2019m personally struggling with her age in looking at if a 16 year old in today\u2019s society could REALLY not know better.  None of this changes the fact that you don\u2019t have to be subjected to ongoing racist, sexualized assaults and she, not you, was the bad guy here.", "NTA she needs to back off .", "Though K-pop did come from South Korea is not fully part of the culture.
