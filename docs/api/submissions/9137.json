It's not cool that she reduced being Korean to just k-pop and harassing you about it. \n\nAnd I was raised to never make fun of someone for learning a foreign language or to mock someone for poor English, because they put in the effort to learn and they were trying, so I think it was kind of shitty for you to insult her for trying to learn Korean. \n\nShe's 98% AH and you're 2% AH imo.", "I lost it at the part where she told you you looked like a bunch of different k-pop idols all at once.

That's just gross. \n\nIf you want to bring this to the principal (and you should), make sure to use a few buzzwords. \n\n1. She has been interrupting me during classroom time by distracting me with off-topic subjects. \n2. She keeps showing me TikTok videos in class that have nothing to do with the subject. \n3. She speaks to me in Korean when we're in English class, I'm trying to learn about Beowulf and Grendel, not practice Korean. \n4.

The performers themselves basically have to always present 'in character'. They're often not really permitted to have 'real' lives. They have to appear emotionally available to their fans. Their marketing is very much about them being fantasy boyfriends/girlfriends. (Girls and women especially.) Many k-pop performers can't date, can only rarely see their families, are pushed to exhaustion by tour/practice schedules...all to feel accessible to fans 24/7. So I think kids  having this kind of fast track to obsessing with k-pop, or they were already prone to obsessing and k-pop opened this shiny new door.", "What body shaming?\n\nBody shaming is mocking someone for their body being different. \n\nI'm suggesting comparing them to someone who looks nothing like them, and in my experience, girls like this are all super skinny and arrogant about it. \n\nThe point is to demonstrate to her exactly how offensive she's being.", "It sucks ive had this happen in school as a kid but with English in a nonenglish speaking country, the teacher started bullying me, and then the principal followed suit.
