Sounds like the group had a fun night and liked their waitress....nothing to worry about.\n\nMy wife and I have been out to dinner, had a fantastic waiter who will crack some corny joke that lands, and after he walks away she'll say \"omg I love him!\" No reason to make a scene (yet.....)", "YTA its an obvious figure of speech. Do some growing up or something abput your insecurity because if this makes you upset and go silent treatment that says more about you than him.", "going with YTA because women say similar things all the time and as men we're supposed to be (and usually are) mature enough to not react like a drama queen.", "No one is A.\n\nBoth of you have different set of opinions. Men is simple creature, always be. Imagine a multiple shoe box. Men only open/share one at a time. Most men aren't capable to open more than one. If the man asked how his day went, he will share how his day was. Thats it.\n\nThe point is mostly there are no nefarious or ill intention. This is why he don't understand what he share is making you upset. He only open a box of sharing how his day went. He doesn't open box of relationship. He doesn't open box of potential partner. etc. We do understand why you upset with how he said \"kind of fell in love with her\" but he and his friends might just love as in waitress work not as potential partner. Imao, just misscommunication really.\n\nAnd be careful because in men's eyes if he sharing make the partner upset, he has two choice, in the future either he share again with simple answer (e.g. \"its fun\" or \"its good) and left the details out or he won't at all.\n\nThat's why lots of men have tendency to become more silent and less expression once they are in relationship. This in my opinion a somewhat prove that men love their partner. They chose to be with their partner and stay expressionless rather than risk upseting their partner and led to break up. As for if this healthy relationship, i leave this with the expert.\n\nAs for your feelings, talk it out with him since both of you has valid feelings.", "100% NTA.

Again, it's hard to judge without knowing your relationship. \n\nThat doesn't mean your feelings are not valid. They are.

Maybe he was trying to share his day  without making you jealous (for example, he wanted to be honest) or maybe he was.\n\nWe don't know that. \n\nIt's unfair to label you insecure and he an asshole when other things should be taken into account.

Maybe it's harmless and it is just his personality? I do know some people like that, they say they love a person and it's mostly meaningless given the context.
