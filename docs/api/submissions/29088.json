This is a throw away account! I\u2019m gonna be using fake names.\n\nSo I (24F) was with Kin (28M) for 5 years on and off. We go back when I was in 2nd grade and he was in 6th grade. Had the biggest crush for a long time. We did get together when I was 19 and he was 23. He is my older brothers best friend. Still are best friends. We do have a 2 year old son together. So you can get the back story.\n\nWe broke up due to him moving to a different state few months ago. Now he moved back because his grandmother is not doing well. We didn\u2019t get back together. He however reconnected with his first girlfriend from high school. Let\u2019s call her Molly (32F) which she also used to date his older cousin. Lol\n\nFor some reason Molly never liked me and I didn\u2019t really initiate any bad feelings towards her. I don\u2019t really know her, but she is good with our son. However not good with me. I treat her with kindness when she\u2019s around and I usually leave her alone. She just gives me these glares and say a lot of really passive aggressive stuff a lot to me. Which I don\u2019t let it get to me.\n\nKin family really adores me and I love them so much back. When I was with Kin he did propose to me with his grandmothers ring, which I still do have. His grandmother also gave me her silver jewelry with turquoise on them and some vintage western jewelry. Which were in their family for years. She also gave me a very special ring and bracelet that I wear everyday. \n\nThe ring is a matching ring which Kin has as well. It belonged to his step grandfather and his grandmother.\n\nHowever Molly learned of this, she demanded I give her all the silver jewelry and the engagement ring. Especially the matching rings. She thinks I should give them to her. Because she\u2019s gonna be in their family now and I\u2019m gonna be second fiddled. She had said that the only reason I\u2019m around is because we have a child. Of course I told her no, and had said \u201cThat these jewelry mean so much to me and was given to me.\u201d And \u201cKin\u2019s family is a second family to me.\u201d \n\n\nThat seemed to make her more angry and it got to the point I had to block her. Yet she still continues to harass me about it. I did told Kin about it and he said he will take care of it. But it still is happening. His grandmother is literally like a second grandmother to me. \n\nI did lost my grandmother from my father side when I was 14 and it was really hard on me. Until I met Kin\u2019s grandmother and we talk a lot and see each other from time to time. Where I see her as my grandmother.  I hold them so much cherish and especially now that she\u2019s not doing so well.. \n\nSo Reddit AITA for not giving it to her??\n\nEDIT: Everyone saying I should give the engagement ring back. I forgot to add that Kin\u2019s grandmother wants me to keep it and Kin doesn\u2019t care for it. He wants me to keep it. So does rest of Kin\u2019s family, his two older sisters don\u2019t want or his older brother. It\u2019s just Molly who\u2019s making it a problem.", "created_utc": 1697507089, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179mxfb/aita_for_not_giving_my_exes_new_fianc\u00e9e_my/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Molly is massively overstepping her bounds.", "She has no claim at all the ones his grandmother gave to you. Those are yours whether you are with him or not. \n\nIt's a bit complicated with the one he gave you. Since people do return engagement rings once the engagement is over. You guys never did that.

You and the family will always be connected through your son and your relationships with the other family members.", "NTA.    Tell the jealous little cow to go away.

For this, you are definitely the AH unless your ex and his grandmother both want you to keep it.  If that is the case, NTA.  When it comes to the other jewelry, they are gifts that are yours unless you decide otherwise.", "NTA. You're literally part of the family w/ your son being in the picture and it's still a family heirloom that you can leave to him and maybe whoever he marries esp if the grandma wants you to keep it as well. She's trippin and needs to get over it lol it's not a good look to demand things from ppl after insulting them", "NTA tell her to kiss your entire ass.", "You could ask the grandmother about the jewelry but it was a gift to you from her. Molly has no right to it. \n\nAs for the ring, if Kin wants it back, then he should have the ring back. As your engagement was broken and the ring should be returned. \n\nBut in the long run, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ll gift the jewelry down to your son or his children.

If the family wanted them back, they would tell you. They know his son will have them. Ignore her and her problem with you.", "You don\u2019t seem like the petty type but if this Molly person kept harassing me I\u2019d file a restraining order.

She\u2019s one of the most sweetest women and she really told that I should keep them and Kin doesn\u2019t care for them and already has bought Molly a very fancy engagement ring.

That is not the kind of person he should choose to be the stepmother of his child. She\u2019s clearly jealous that you\u2019ll always be in the picture due to your child with Kin.\n\nMake sure you document and screenshot everything she says. Homegirl is a bit unhinged.", "Nta. Id honestly question why your ex wants to still marry molly despite what happened and how shes treating you, who is the mother of his child and considering youre like family already to him and his family", "Emphatically NTA with this added information.", "I would add this in your post.", "Molly can go shit in her hat.   \nNTA.", "Yeah I saw it later", "Honestly I have been keep screen shots and keeping my distant from her.
