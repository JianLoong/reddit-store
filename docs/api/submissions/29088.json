Had the biggest crush for a long time. We did get together when I was 19 and he was 23. He is my older brothers best friend. Still are best friends. We do have a 2 year old son together. So you can get the back story.\n\nWe broke up due to him moving to a different state few months ago. Now he moved back because his grandmother is not doing well. We didn\u2019t get back together. He however reconnected with his first girlfriend from high school. Let\u2019s call her Molly (32F) which she also used to date his older cousin. Lol\n\nFor some reason Molly never liked me and I didn\u2019t really initiate any bad feelings towards her. I don\u2019t really know her, but she is good with our son. However not good with me. I treat her with kindness when she\u2019s around and I usually leave her alone. She just gives me these glares and say a lot of really passive aggressive stuff a lot to me. Which I don\u2019t let it get to me.\n\nKin family really adores me and I love them so much back. When I was with Kin he did propose to me with his grandmothers ring, which I still do have. His grandmother also gave me her silver jewelry with turquoise on them and some vintage western jewelry. Which were in their family for years. She also gave me a very special ring and bracelet that I wear everyday. \n\nThe ring is a matching ring which Kin has as well. It belonged to his step grandfather and his grandmother.\n\nHowever Molly learned of this, she demanded I give her all the silver jewelry and the engagement ring. Especially the matching rings. She thinks I should give them to her. Because she\u2019s gonna be in their family now and I\u2019m gonna be second fiddled. She had said that the only reason I\u2019m around is because we have a child. Of course I told her no, and had said \u201cThat these jewelry mean so much to me and was given to me.\u201d And \u201cKin\u2019s family is a second family to me.\u201d \n\n\nThat seemed to make her more angry and it got to the point I had to block her. Yet she still continues to harass me about it. I did told Kin about it and he said he will take care of it. But it still is happening. His grandmother is literally like a second grandmother to me. \n\nI did lost my grandmother from my father side when I was 14 and it was really hard on me. Until I met Kin\u2019s grandmother and we talk a lot and see each other from time to time. Where I see her as my grandmother.  I hold them so much cherish and especially now that she\u2019s not doing so well.. \n\nSo Reddit AITA for not giving it to her??\n\nEDIT: Everyone saying I should give the engagement ring back. I forgot to add that Kin\u2019s grandmother wants me to keep it and Kin doesn\u2019t care for it. He wants me to keep it. So does rest of Kin\u2019s family, his two older sisters don\u2019t want or his older brother.
