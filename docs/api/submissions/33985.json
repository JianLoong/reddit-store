It is sad that that's how society is, but that's the reality. The whole \"retired firefighter\" schtik was such a gratuitous sympathy grab it just had to be leading up to a confidence trick at least (\"Oh I'm too poor to afford the bus, food, rent, etc can you lend me $100\"). Also firefighters aren't afraid of getting wet.\n\nNTA", "NTA, it is not safe to pick up anyone you don\u2019t know.  You have no proof he is who he says he is.  Someone who is a retired fire fighter has resources to fix this in most areas.  They usually have retirement benefits beyond social security and can go in the restaurant and get a ride.  The fact that you didn\u2019t recognize that something was off concerns me.  One of my adult kids struggles similarly and has a personal rule that she cannot do things like give rides or sign up for things online until she double triple checks.  Because her spidy senses are off and she needs to be safe.", "NTA.

You understood that it was not a normal request and you picked up on some important red flags. People try to make you feel guilty when they want to control you.

Thanks, kinda felt like I was being paranoid/dramatic for thinking that but good to know others see it as similarly sketchy.", "Ha, I mentioned Ted Bundy too!

It's sad that people genuinely in need might not get helped as a result, but it's more important to be cautious with strangers.", "I mean I said I did recognize something was a little off about it, just double checking my read was correct. But the responses have definitely hammered it home not to give rides to people", "I might have given the guy an umbrella that I keep in my car, or a little cash he could use to buy a cheap one at a nearby store, but that's the most I would have done. It's unfortunate, but these days, letting some random total stranger get into your car is just too likely to end tragically.", "Every first responder that I've ever met \\*that had good intentions\\* would tell you never to give a stranger a ride. Dropping his former profession into the conversation at best seems like a way of manipulating you into doing something you're uncomfortable with, at worst it was a ploy by someone with nefarious intentions."]}
