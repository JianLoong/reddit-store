It seems like it would be an easy thing to do.", "NTA \n\nMaybe your mom is, a little? Your girlfriend could have sat at any table in the house. I don't see why she needed to be in your sister's room. \n\nI would have sided with your sister, but having a total meltdown and starting a screaming match over this is ridiculous. If things escalated to the point where your mom won't attend her daughter's wedding? Sister was way out of line.", "ESH. Your mother allowed gf into sisters room without clearing it with her. Sister has massively overreacted, got fianc\u00e9 involved when it\u2019s nothing to do with him. You\u2019re all now refusing to attend wedding when in the grand scheme of things this is a trivial matter.", "Might be on my own here but gonna say NTA however;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAllowing your gf to go into sisters room is an invasion of privacy. However most polite people would allow this due to the circumstances. (while I was away I allowed my sister to use my PC monitors to work from home from in fairness to them they asked, but i would've been fine if they hadn't also) But your mum is right, its their house, sister does not pay rent, technically she could kick you all out as your are adults.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI find it strange your sisters attachment to her childhood room, you'd think that a woman about to get married would be more prepared to move on from it but she seems overly attached. (some amount of speculation in my head is saying there is something more to this) The whole reaction is way out of proportion, a simple 'next time don't invite people into my room when I'm not there' would suffice imo. Maybe I think this as I'm generally non-confrontational.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA for violating personal space but the reaction is beyond excessive, I don't even understand what your sister is getting out of this dispute.", "NTA. But you mother is. If your sister has a room assigned for personal use, she can expect privacy in there and she is right to be upset \u2026 at her mother. Your gf could have refused to use the room out of courtesy but she does not know the rules of the house and did as she was told by the mother. This can be seen as insensitive and warrants the apology she gave. Your sister and your gf should meet and talk this through in person.", "ESH. Don't invade personal space like that, and you and your mom need to apologize and internalize that this was a serious disrespect. (Your mom seems to need to learn that her daughter is an adult with rights and feelings.) But your sister should at some point let this go with a stern \"don't ever do it again\" especially against your GF who didn't know any better.", "OP you are missing the point. It's not about you and your gf. It's about your sister and the disrespect from your mom (and you) to her personal space.\nNobody screams around cause of one incident. \n\nYTA for not understanding your sister's view point.", "ESH. Your sister for freaking out and dragging her BF into this. \n\nThe rest of you for setting her up in Sister's room. Don't you have a desk in your room? Or a kitchen table? Coffee table? A couch? Heck, she could've worked sitting on your bed. There was zero reason her work had to be done on a designated desk.", "YTA\n\nYou (and your mother) are YTA for allowing your GF access to your sister's personal space without discussing it with her. What if she has sensitive information lying around, like financials or a diary. She has every right being upset about that.\n\nYou are also both the asshole for not apologizing, instead it is your GF doing the apologizing which she should not have to do. It was you and your mother who told her to use the room.\n\nYour sister not paying rent or contributing is a seperate issue and not relevant, she is using the room, it is her personal space. Does your mother walk into the room at any time because it is her house, so she should be allowed to? \n\nShould your sister start yelling over this issue, no, a normal discussion between adults seems a more reasonable solution, however she felt her privacy was violated so I understand her emotions. Her fianc\u00e9 is involved because he loves your sister and it is two (your mother and you) against one (your sister). He is being protective as he should. \n\nThe whole not attending the wedding seems like a huge overreaction on your and your mother's side. 'My gf said sorry, and I think she and her fianc\u00e9 should also apologize for overreacting and especially for being disrespectful to my mom.' Again, your GF does not have to apologise for doing what you and your mother told her to do, you and your mother were in the wrong. You need to take the first step.", "NTA. I won't go either", "YTA She has a right to her personal space. It's basic respect.", "YTA. Your mother did the wrong thing in telling your gf she could use someone else's room. Someone should have asked your sister. \n\nThis row is between your mother and sister; don't escalate things by not attending her wedding. Your sister was shouting at her mother, not your gf. Your sister does not have to apologise to your mother; butt out.", "YTA. She has a right to be upset. Her being this upset at all tells me this is probably something she has to deal with a lot.", "YTA", "ESH.", "ESH (except your GF)\n\nYou and your mom had no right telling her to go into your sisters room.  I\u2019d be mad too! Why didn\u2019t anyone ask her? Though with no notice, she might have said no even if asked - and that\u2019s fair.\n\nSounds like sister is overreacting, but no one is respecting her privacy.", "NTA\n\nHas your sister always been like this?\n\nYou had your mothers permission to use the room.  I can understand why your sister was upset as this is her personal space but at the same time it is your mothers house.  But your mother is TA here.  You and your gf should've thought a bit harder as to how you would feel if the situation was reversed.  It's possible that you won't care... or you might.\n\nPerhaps next time (if there is a next time), think twice before you invade someone's personal space even if you don't mind yourself if someone does it to you.\n\nIt's your sisters over reaction to this whole situation that makes your NTA... I might be saying something different if her behaviour was modulated... but it's not.\n\nYour sister doesn't seem to like your GF... do you know why.  I have no issues with your GF not going and I probably wouldn't go if I was her after this behaviour.  As for you... the most important person is your GF.  There is some call to you attending the ceremony only... but that could be seen as enabling.", "YTA you invaded her space without asking. You, the gf and the mom are massive aholes.", "HTA but mum is your sister is entitled to privacy rent or no rent your mum should have ran the idea by her before giving the use of her room to someone. Sister absolutely over reacted and sis fianc\u00e9 didn't need to be involved", "YTA you preached her privacy and violated her trust. \n\nHow you and your mother feels about sharing the desk is irrelevant as it was Never yours to share at all.\n\nOf course your sister got heated when everyone just doubled down on not admitting their faults and telling her she was the one wrong for feeling violated and daring to voice it. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 goes free of the asshole label though as she did at least give a sincere apology and could see how it was wrong. \n\nYou and your mother though \u2026", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At the very least the apology from the gf should have softened the entire thing enough to have an adult discussion about boundaries with her mother.\n\nThis is two nearly 30-year-old people engaging in hostile, violent verbal interactions with 3 individuals, and they expect everyone to forget that and attend their wedding despite treating them horribly because of a mistake? No. This is toxic behavior, and I find it disturbing that attacking one's mother with your s/o is ranked lower on your list than not asking before allowing company to use their laptop in your room.
