Recently my gf was over for the day because there was an unplanned outage in her neighborhood and she needed to work from my place. Me and my mom told my gf she could just use my sister's \\[27F\\] desk in her room since my sister was at work in office. I didn't think this was a big deal, it's just a table, but later receive a message from her fianc\u00e9 in our groupchat letting me and my gf know how extremely upset my sister is that my gf was in her room without permission.\n\nMy gf messaged my sister back directly and apologized for what happened. Gf didn't think it was a big deal either since my mom said it was fine to use the desk, but she said she understands why my sister got mad since it was in her room, her personal space.\n\nMy sister got into a major fight with my mom and started yelling at the top of her lungs about this. Mom is saying we did nothing wrong as this is her (my mom's) house and my sister doesn't pay rent or contribute in any other way. Sister's fianc\u00e9 \\[27M\\] called my mom about this too and started yelling at my mom and being extremely rude and disrespectful.  I do not understand why she got her fianc\u00e9 involved as this has nothing to do with him. But based on what's happened, my gf doesn't want to attend sister's wedding in July. She feels uncomfortable and awkward since things are heated and my sister and her fianc\u00e9 are being so hostile.  I don't think my sister cares if my gf doesn't attend but us siding with my gf is upsetting my sister more. I told my sister I'm not attending either and she can have the wedding without us (my mom is with me on this), if she doesn't stop overreacting. My gf said sorry, and I think she and her fianc\u00e9 should also apologize for overreacting and especially for being disrespectful to my mom.\n\nETA: It just didn't occur to me to call or text my sister - letting someone use a table seemed like such a small thing. Maybe that's bad judgment on my part. I have texted my sister an apology re: asking permission but she hasn't responded. Honestly, I still think she way overreacted by behaving like my gf ransacked her room or snooped through her things when she was there to work. Re: why we wanted the room specifically, we just thought it best if my gf could have a proper desk? And, we both live at home still. \n\nETA #2: More context on why my gf doesn\u2019t want to go to wedding. My gf has expressed to me that she finds it hard to connect with my sister and she has the \u2018feeling\u2019 that my sister never liked her from the start. My sis is someone who is difficult to get along with, as she\u2019s easily triggered and moody. Given this fiasco, gf just feels more comfortable not going. She doesn\u2019t want to be there if she\u2019s not welcome and if she\u2019s only tolerated because she happens to be dating me. In addition, sister has not acknowledged my gf\u2019s apology so as it stands, things are not ok between us.", "created_utc": 1685613578, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xdga9/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 905, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However most polite people would allow this due to the circumstances. (while I was away I allowed my sister to use my PC monitors to work from home from in fairness to them they asked, but i would've been fine if they hadn't also) But your mum is right, its their house, sister does not pay rent, technically she could kick you all out as your are adults.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI find it strange your sisters attachment to her childhood room, you'd think that a woman about to get married would be more prepared to move on from it but she seems overly attached. (some amount of speculation in my head is saying there is something more to this) The whole reaction is way out of proportion, a simple 'next time don't invite people into my room when I'm not there' would suffice imo.

Your gf could have refused to use the room out of courtesy but she does not know the rules of the house and did as she was told by the mother. This can be seen as insensitive and warrants the apology she gave. Your sister and your gf should meet and talk this through in person.", "ESH. Don't invade personal space like that, and you and your mom need to apologize and internalize that this was a serious disrespect.

It was you and your mother who told her to use the room.\n\nYour sister not paying rent or contributing is a seperate issue and not relevant, she is using the room, it is her personal space. Does your mother walk into the room at any time because it is her house, so she should be allowed to? \n\nShould your sister start yelling over this issue, no, a normal discussion between adults seems a more reasonable solution, however she felt her privacy was violated so I understand her emotions. Her fianc\u00e9 is involved because he loves your sister and it is two (your mother and you) against one (your sister). He is being protective as he should. \n\nThe whole not attending the wedding seems like a huge overreaction on your and your mother's side. 'My gf said sorry, and I think she and her fianc\u00e9 should also apologize for overreacting and especially for being disrespectful to my mom.'

It's possible that you won't care... or you might.\n\nPerhaps next time (if there is a next time), think twice before you invade someone's personal space even if you don't mind yourself if someone does it to you.\n\nIt's your sisters over reaction to this whole situation that makes your NTA... I might be saying something different if her behaviour was modulated... but it's not.\n\nYour sister doesn't seem to like your GF... do you know why.

Like, at all.", "Esh. I get her being upset but she did go above & beyond. Not just at your mom either. Her fiance jumping in, not once but twice & yelling at your mom is uncalled for. Ive been married 30yrs & my husband better never even think abt talking to my parents that way. Its one thing to call & try to talk it out but thats not what he did. I wouldn't go to that wedding if you paid me but esp so without an a$$ kissing apology. \n Common sense, you don't go into someone else's personal space without permission. She could have worked from any hard surface in the house. But an \"im sorry\" for 1st offense, when having others tell you its ok, should have been enough. The rest of it is an overreaction in my opinion.", "Sister had a right to feel her privacy was invaded, but massively overreacted. Is this a common theme? Your mom and gf are a little to blame as nobody likes people in their bedroom who weren\u2019t given permission.  This really feels like there\u2019s underlying issues and this one thing just set it off. ESH", "ESH\n\nYes, Mom shouldn't have just allowed gf to use other daughter's desk without permission.  Yes other daughter over reacted, as did her fiance.  OP's being a little dismissive of sister's concerns, but is she really going to blow off her sister's wedding over this?\n\nI also find myself wondering why the heck a 3+ bedroom house doesn't have at least a kitchen table the gf could have set up at instead.  Would it really have been that much of a burden for OP and her mother(?) to have been a little quiet for a few hours?", "It\u2019s understandable to be upset A LITTLE at personal space being used, but that could have been a simple statement, gf leaving and using a different space in the house, and saying you\u2019ll not use her space again without permission. Yelling though? Total overreaction. Nta.", "your mom is ta. \"it's my house, you aren't allowed to have boundaries\" is abusive af. is your sister autistic? can she just not afford to move out?", "NTA\n\nYour GF was only slightly out of line when she used a space after being directed to by the actual owner of the house. When prompted, she apologized. It should have ended there.\n\nNo clue what the deal is between your mom and the 27 yr old still living at home contributing nothing, but I suspect that this has been a point of contention before. Doesn't sound like you know anything about it or that mom gave any indication it was a thing.\n\nYour sister was not wrong to be upset and want an apology. But she directed her being upset at the wrong person when it was your mom who knew better. And then she took it WAY TOO FAR for WAY TOO LONG. Your sister has made it weird.\n\nYou're definitely not the asshole at this point. Your GF is definitely not the asshole at this point.\n\nI suspect your mom and your sister are VERY MUCH the asshole for reasons both known and unknown.", "NTA Sounds like sister has two rooms in the house that she pays nothing towards.", "Is your sister ever homophobic to you guys? It's understandable to be upset over a boundary crossed, but I wonder if she's never liked your gf and went apeshit over this bc she's lesbophobic and sees your gf as a predator to her. Family members sometimes get the homphobia pass bc \"they're gay but they're my sibling so i love them\" whereas she could feel bitter about your girlfriend being a lesbian.", "OP and her GF already gave the sister their separated apologies. Sister failed to acknowledge or accept any of them.", "This. OP is leaving out key information. The series of events just don\u2019t reasonably add up.", ">Your sister probably got her fiance involved because your mom sounds old school, and getting a man involved might come across different than a woman.\n\n\"old school\" does not play like that. Family matters are treated between family members, meaning the sister's fianc\u00e9 should never get involved to the point of yelling at his future MIL, even more if the was not an aggravated part.\n\nIf sister had a problem with her fiance's mother, it would be up to the fianc\u00e9 to speak with his mom. The exception is if all parties agree to meet and discuss.\n\nI believe the mother took the biggest offense from OP's sister AND her fianc\u00e9 yelling at her, which was overboard and uncalled for.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Sister also would likely consider her fiance to be family as they are about to be family. And as a millennial, I play dirty when it comes to older folks who think it's still back in the day because there are very limited ways to handle people like this. I will 100% involve my husband in my family matters if needed because I know I'm not respected simply because I'm a girl. I've been told it my whole life that the reason was quite literally because I'm a girl. Now I hear the reason is because I'm a woman. At least it's been recognized that I'm an adult now, but the treatment is no different. Thankfully I don't still live with my parents so contact can be kept limited.", "Mom is TA for giving other people permission to use her daughter\u2019s room because it\u2019s her (mom\u2019s) house. People deserve to keep their private spaces private, and to decide for themselves who enters their space & uses their stuff. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fact that mom doesn\u2019t respect that probably goes a long way toward explaining why OP\u2019s sister got so upset.

Sounds like she is a spoiled brat and if she was that upset, she could have handled it like an adult and accepted the apology and moved on.", "NTA. Honestly everyone\u2019s family has different relationships about personal spaces. I grew up in a family where anyone could sleep in anyone\u2019s bed or use any bathroom if another was occupied. If I\u2019m personally in my room with the door closed that might be different but generally it\u2019s kind of all communal. Like obviously it IS someone\u2019s room, but like if you need a desk, who cares if someone else uses it. We have a similar relationship about vehicles. We have our specific vehicles but outside of work hours, if one happens to be parked last in the driveway and someone needs to run to the store, its just easiest to drive the last car instead of shuffling cars around. I dunno, at the end of the day most everything in my parents house was paid for by them and yea we have our space to live and personalize but it just wasn\u2019t a huge deal for anyone else to use something as impersonal as a desk. If someone needs to work but the other people in the house want to chat, it makes sense to put them in a room to focus instead of being distracted by others who aren\u2019t working all sharing a common space.", "NTA and your sister has some serious issues. I\u2019m going to be honest though, your whole family sounds proper weird. The only person seemingly acting like an adult in this story is your gf.", "People seem to have some pretty different cultural outlooks on this.\n\nI would not expect to be called before my husband let someone use my desk. (Or my parents, but I don't live with them anymore.) I straight up wouldn't care someone used my desk, it would not be a big deal to me.\n\nThat said, if someone called me at work over this I would be annoyed with them. I work directly with students and when I'm stepping away to take a call it should be an emergency or at least something important and time sensitive. To me this is not important, asking me is completely unnecessary, and as such it is interrupting me and the people I work with to waste my time. Bothering me at work over something that feels so trivial to me would feel disrespectful of my job, my time, and the people I'm working with.\n\nObviously this depends since you'd like to be called at work over little stuff like this. (Or maybe this is a big deal to you?) But some people don't have jobs that it's convenient to be interrupted over every minor question at home your family can figure out on their own. Some people can't even answer the phone at work at all or for large parts of their day.", "Sometimes people get stubborn in the heat of things but when they calm down they\u2019re open to repairing a relationship. And sometimes they\u2019re just toxic a-holes. This would clarify which the sister is. \n\nBut it\u2019s just a suggestion. OP might feel the sister\u2019s actions thus far have already gone beyond the pale, but if she wants to try, from what I read it sounds like there\u2019s a possibility that the sister would be open it to. That\u2019s if OP wants to even wants to try. I honestly wouldn\u2019t blame her for going low or no contact.", "you've never met a spoiled princess before? I can assure you there are plenty of people who flip tf out over the tiniest thing. like the post the other day about the woman (20) who hasn't talked to her siblings in a month because they used the soap that her mother bought because it's 'her' soap.

I have never in my life called up my husband's Mom to yell at her over the phone for anything, let alone where they let people sit in their own house. If my husband had called up my parents to yell at them that would not have been a turn-on for me but a giant red flag that he was not a normal safe dude.\n\nI think how private of a space Sister's room in her Mother's house she dosen't contribute to is a somewhat cultural question. People's views on it will vary. I can understand Sister being annoyed someone went into \"her\" space without asking and even snapping at her own Mom about it in her frustration. But then for Sister's boyfriend to call and yell at his partner's mom (for letting someone use a desk in her own house) is insane to me. It screams anger issues or just massive disrespect for others or both.\n\nI aboustley would not be happy my family member was marrying someone who did this.  If my brother got an SO who called up my Mom and yelled at her for what she did in her own home I would not be thrilled about their wedding. Currently we have a nice family without anybody like that and I really don't want 30 years of holidays with some awful angry meddling asshole. Plus, when you marry someone who treats others like trash you're pretty delusional if you think it's never going to be turned towards you. What happens when Sister does something her husband dosen't like?\n\nThough, Sister may be just as unpleasant a person to be stuck with as her groom.", "It\u2019s whacked to get into screaming matches about this, not excepting apologies and involving your fianc\u00e9 who is rude and disrespectful to your mum.", "Yeah NTA. \n\nYou or your mum should have probably texted your sister before letting your gf use her desk. But I get why you didn't think it was a big deal.\n\nI also understand why your sister might have been upset. Having someone in your room without your permission does feel like an invasion of privacy. I might have been a bit annoyed too.\n\nHowever, your sister became the AH when she wouldn't let it go and then elevated her anger and the arguments AND brought her fianc\u00e9 in to yell at your mum.

Thanks.\"\n\nSounds like your sister has some bigger problems if this triggered her so much and she had that reaction. Either that, or she REALLY doesn't like your gf.

It is MIL's house, she invites random people there (and actually it is not a random person, it is someone MIL and her daughters know). I agree that the mother should have asked OP's sister if it is OK to let OP's gf in her room. But the dude should not scream at anybody. It is not his house, not his room. Unless I misunderstood, and he lives there, in his MIL's house. Even if this is the case, he should not scream, he should express his feelings in a civilised way and/or find somewhere else to live.", "Have you ever met an autistic person before? \n\nBecause i\u2019ll definitely flip the fuck out over something like this if my personal belongings and space was constantly violated. \n\nEveryone knows not to touch my stuff or go into my room.
