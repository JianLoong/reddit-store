Be honest:  you bought it because you wanted it and now you're trying to invoke your grandmother's memory to justify it.\n\nIf Brandon is living with you, he has a right to know about your financial situation, including that your house doesn't cost you anything.

That\u2019s pretty immature, and doesn\u2019t bode well for marriage. But I also don\u2019t think it was right for you to not discuss finances fully with the man you are about to marry. Financial compatibility is very important in marriage. Spending $25,000 on a bracelet seems foolish, especially when you say your grandmother wanted you to have hers. It\u2019s a pretty big chunk of the $200,000 inheritance, which may seem like an enormous amount of money at your age, but really isn\u2019t in the big picture of life.

She is provided him with a free roof over his heading in exchange for utilities and bills? It's her house and it's her choice and they aren't married yet, so he has no right to it. If she didn't allow him to live there, there would be little to no chance that he would've found out.\n\nHe should be grateful. Many people don't move in until marriage and he should be very glad to only have to pay those bills because it would probably be worse if he had  rent or better yet, lived alone in an apartment onthat salary. And it's not OP's fault that he makes $20 an hour.  Quite frankly, it sounds like he can't afford to help with the wedding to begin with. If he's feeling insecure about a purchase she made with her money that she has enough of (she has no bills, so why wouldn't she), then he can always get a better job or a raise.\nMaybe compare how much he used to pay in total for living expenses vs now and see if he's being a prick.\nHowever, you really shouldn't have buried that bracelet.

Who tf cares what other people do with their money (unless you\u2019re the fianc\u00e9 lol)\n\nI do agree that doing such a thing without consulting your fianc\u00e9 is absolutely wrong and this can either make or break you guys. You guys can spin this as a positive way to be completely transparent about your income, assets, debt, etc\u2026 and discuss how you guys want to spend money moving forward. Making the switch to a joint life can be seamless for some, but an uncomfortable transition for others. Maybe this was the push you guys needed. \n\nAlso, you were given money to save for your future. Using it towards bills and expensive purchases will drain it quickly. I would look at what you guys bring in monthly with your income (not savings) and whatever percentage you guys each make of the total income, you guys each pay that percentage in bills. \n\nThen you guys both will have the $175k (now) nest egg to invest for your guys\u2019 future.

I also understand why you buried her with the original bracelet, I think it's important to do what feels right.

I know it wasn't but I just couldn't.  \n\n\nDo agree I should have spoken with brandon first though.", "The family wall is a giant marble wall in my great-aunts backyard (her house is like super ancient) that has almost (?) all the caskets from the past 200 years from our family in it.  When someone dies, we open one of the slot things, put the casket inside, and then bolt it shut.\n\nI could technically request to open the slot, open the casket, and get the bracelet.", "It's costing him more to live with her than it used to cost him to live in an apartment by himself. She grew up rich, has no idea what it's like to struggle to make ends meet, and is charging him way too much for the privilege of living with her.", "Your boyfriend couldn't afford to pay for half of a mortgage that big.\n\nHe also couldn't honestly afford to pay $1,500/month in bills, either. It doesn't matter that $1,500 is less than $2,500. It's still outside of his price range.\n\nIt's financially healthy to aim to spend no more than 30% of your gross income on housing. If he's only making $40k/year, he should have been living someplace that cost him $1k/month or less.\n\nIf you had him pay an amount he could afford, him finding out about your previously undisclosed inheritance would not have been such a big deal.", "Honestly I think this is the way. I\u2019m sorry I was a bit flippant in my original post but all I could think about was my own grandmother telling me she\u2019s come back from the dead and kill me if I tried to bury her in any of her jewelry- that she wanted it to be worn by those she loved.\n\nIn your grief you made a couple poor decisions, but you can correct them both.\n\nGet your grandmothers actual bracelet and wear it with love to carry her memory. Return the meaningless bracelet and use that $25k for something important, or fun!\n\nNow, since I think we\u2019re friends, lol, as for the boyfriend complaining about having to pay bills at the house now that he knows you own it outright\u2026\u2026. Do not let him mooch off you. He has no rights to the house, and you\u2019re being more than generous by having him pay certain specific bills. \nIf that\u2019s no longer okay for him, then you price out comps in the area of what it would cost for him to be renting that house with a roommate and charge him whatever full right would be plus utilities. I can only imagine it would easily be at least 3 times what he\u2019s paying now.\n\nAnd if he\u2019s going to act like a child and disappear, and not communicate with you, then good riddance", "They are living together and her boyfriend said \u201cthey\u201d can\u2019t afford spending 25k in a piece of jewelry.  So, clearly, they are combining their household expenses and it sounds like the boyfriend was willingly paying a big portion of it without complaint when he thought she was contributing as well. To find out that she was not only paying nothing towards their living expenses, but had money to burn is a slap the face.", "Why would you personally have to remove her jewelry as opposed to receiving her belongings from the funeral home?", "You could have asked the funeral home to remove it.  \n\nYTA", "Thank you for explaining, I had no idea. So kinda like a crypt, but for a family. A part of the estate. I understand that you feel your grandma's bracelet was part of her, and she wanted you to have it, so it would be like having her always with you while also honoring her wishes.", "This!!!! You don\u2019t remove it! That\u2019s the funeral home\u2019s job!", "We didn't use a funeral home... she was buried on my great-aunts estate. I didn't have much control anyways?", "Yes. It's a weird dilemma for me. It's a part of her but she also wanted me to have it. Puzzling.", "We didn't use a funeral home. We just bought a casket and placed her in the wall. It's tradition.", "Did you do all the embalming yourselves at home, too?", "I would love it if I could have a part of my grandma always with me.", "This is so hilariously fake. Bravo.", "Same. I'll talk with my auntie later.  Ty <3", "Why would we use a funeral home? We have a family wall on my great aunts estate...", "\u2026Do you think people buy their own caskets (from somewhere that\u2019s not a funeral home), embalm their own family members, and then bury them themselves?"]}
