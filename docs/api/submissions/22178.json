That\u2019s pretty immature, and doesn\u2019t bode well for marriage. But I also don\u2019t think it was right for you to not discuss finances fully with the man you are about to marry. Financial compatibility is very important in marriage. Spending $25,000 on a bracelet seems foolish, especially when you say your grandmother wanted you to have hers. It\u2019s a pretty big chunk of the $200,000 inheritance, which may seem like an enormous amount of money at your age, but really isn\u2019t in the big picture of life.

She is provided him with a free roof over his heading in exchange for utilities and bills? It's her house and it's her choice and they aren't married yet, so he has no right to it. If she didn't allow him to live there, there would be little to no chance that he would've found out.\n\nHe should be grateful. Many people don't move in until marriage and he should be very glad to only have to pay those bills because it would probably be worse if he had  rent or better yet, lived alone in an apartment onthat salary. And it's not OP's fault that he makes $20 an hour.  Quite frankly, it sounds like he can't afford to help with the wedding to begin with. If he's feeling insecure about a purchase she made with her money that she has enough of (she has no bills, so why wouldn't she), then he can always get a better job or a raise.\nMaybe compare how much he used to pay in total for living expenses vs now and see if he's being a prick.\nHowever, you really shouldn't have buried that bracelet.

Who tf cares what other people do with their money (unless you\u2019re the fianc\u00e9 lol)\n\nI do agree that doing such a thing without consulting your fianc\u00e9 is absolutely wrong and this can either make or break you guys. You guys can spin this as a positive way to be completely transparent about your income, assets, debt, etc\u2026 and discuss how you guys want to spend money moving forward. Making the switch to a joint life can be seamless for some, but an uncomfortable transition for others. Maybe this was the push you guys needed. \n\nAlso, you were given money to save for your future. Using it towards bills and expensive purchases will drain it quickly. I would look at what you guys bring in monthly with your income (not savings) and whatever percentage you guys each make of the total income, you guys each pay that percentage in bills. \n\nThen you guys both will have the $175k (now) nest egg to invest for your guys\u2019 future.

I also understand why you buried her with the original bracelet, I think it's important to do what feels right.

I use a couple different types of clover and other low growing ground cover.\n\nDrought tolerant,  stays green, 0 mowing and great for pollinators!\n\nCost $50.  Never watering and mowing again,  priceless!", "Read this as watering my snail farm and filling their pool \n\nNow all I can picture is a happy little snail resort", "Where do you all live that your water bill is under $50? I live in central Iowa and my water/gas/sewage bill is over $200 every month with budget billing. I want to move where I can pay $50 just for water alone.", "I just said above my water bill is over $200 a month but that includes water, gas, sewage. I want to move somewhere where it is that cheap.", "Understandable but i get not wanting to take it off of her deceased grandma\u2019s wrist\u2026.it would\u2019ve been diff if the bracelet was not on her at the time", "Yeah, that was a really stupid thing to do. Especially since grandma already said she wanted OP to have it. Just a waste of $25K, which I guess is fine if you\u2019re rich but OP\u2019s boyfriend making $20 an hour is far from rich. \n\nYTA", "I do agree with this. The issue isn\u2019t the purchase it\u2019s the dishonesty.", "Right. Boyfriend would likely chose to live more simply if not living with OP. Boyfriend is not mooching or getting a free place to live; OP is getting the benefit of having most of their monthly bills paid while OP gets the (maybe?) benefit of living in a larger place than they would otherwise. You could argue that OP is getting the better end of the deal.", "Her and her boyfriend can do it together. It will be the sort of bonding moment they need to reconnect after this fight.", "This cannot be a real post right? First of all who pays $500 a month for water, second why would you bury a family heirloom with the relative who specifically told you they wanted you to have it", "Right? OP hasn\u2019t outright said it anywhere but says she has a maid she pays for, big property with \u201cspecific settings\u201d for the grass, and just casually browses jewelry stores that carry $25k bracelets\u2026 it all screams little rich girl who is extremely out of touch with what it\u2019s like to have basic housing expenses cost 50% of your income. \n\nOP, settle this for me. How do you earn income to contribute?", "It\u2019s Brandon I feel sorry for. He\u2019s hooked himself someone that has zero comprehension of what real life is like.", "Not everyone processes grief the same way and not everyone is able to handle a situation like this like you so dont blame the OP for not taking the bracelet off.", "How on earth have you got that impression?\n\nHe didn't know about the money and when he found out he left? \n\nHe completely supported her lifestyle by paying ALL of her major bills.\n\nShe basically fleeced him for his money making sure she spent as little as possible supporting her own lifestyle so she had the savings for the couch. If she was paying her fair share would she have been able to afford the couch?\n\nIf this has come out after they had got married even with a prenup he would have 2 factors towards unjust enrichment I doubt it would be hard to find the third factor during the divorce.\n\nEven now not being married if they have been together long enough he may actually still have a case for unjust enrichment.", "My god please never comment ever again, I\u2019m falling on my knees and begging you. Please, oh please!", "And I hope you enjoy your life filled with jealousy and envy for others.", "Spread that clover love!!!", "Spread the word!", "Australia has some really beautiful native plants don't need water. Oneday when I own a house I want to turn the front yard into a low maintenance native garden thay doesn't require any grass, but still looks beautiful", "Native plants! They are literally meant to thrive in your environment", "There are so many better options than covering your yard in plastic that becomes unusable because it\u2019s so hot it\u2019ll burn", "Yep we grow vegetables in the garden and those are the only things in the summer to get any watering. Everything else? Well wait for rain.", "Please, for the sake of all of the nature, don't do this", "The funeral home usually remove jewelry if some is worn during a viewing but isn't to be buried.", "And my big thing is 200k SOUNDS like a lot of money but it\u2019s really not\u2026. Not enough to be throwing down 25k on a bracelet. But that\u2019s just me \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Something to tell the grandkids", "But he probably wouldn\u2019t be spending that much on rent based on his income if you didn\u2019t inherit the house\u2026 so it\u2019s really not a \u201cdeal\u201d and you should be splitting the bills\u2026 you are also living rent free and if he moves out 100% of the bills are your problem. YTA", "What the hell are y\u2019all doing that your monthly house bills are 1500$ ?!?? Aside from the 500$ water bill\u2026", "I have no idea what condition the body might be in by now, but recommend you have a professional remove the bracelet, which might need a thorough cleaning.", "How old is \u201clike super ancient\u201d?", "I did, but it\u2019s subjective, people are different.", "when you're living together, planning to marry and expecting the other person to pay all the household expenses... then yes, you should disclose your finances.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I have no jealousy or envy for those that benefit from the exploitation of others. I have nothing but contempt. There isn\u2019t a house of jet or island in this universe big enough or nice enough for me to be complacent and content with slavery. But thank you for outing yourself as someone who is content with children dying horrifically for their own pleasure. It makes the world an easier place to navigate when monsters label themselves. \ud83d\ude18", "Right, which makes me question whether grandma wanted OP to have it - wouldn\u2019t it have been in the will and expressed to the funeral home?", "200-300 years old? I don\u2019t know.", "Your delusional. Keep crying about things that happened hundreds of years ago. Jesus you people need to get a grip.", "OP could have asked the funeral home to bury it with her.", "Where?", "Based on her responses, it sounds like she was scared to pry the bracelet off her grandma\u2019s hand \ud83d\ude15 I wish someone told her beforehand that the funeral home could take care of that.", "Placed her in what wall???", "Not sure why you commented this in two places. But there\u2019s no requirement for a body to be embalmed if you\u2019re interring it relatively quickly. There are some religions that don\u2019t allow that anyways. \n\nDepending on where OP lives, it\u2019s not that strange for a family to handle burial themselves.", "Funeral home would've taken care of that, especially if ops Gma was cremated, the default is giving the jewelery back in a baggie with the ash box, or a baggie with other personal belongings(wallets usually stay in the pants of dead men until they get to the funeral home) \n\nAny jewelry on dead grandma would've Been offered back to whoever was in charge of planning, so op specifically had to tell them to put it back on her body after funeral prep.", "I\u2019d be a little hesitant to open the casket now\u2026 she uh\u2026 you might not want to see what she currently looks like. So sorry for your loss\u2026 just maybe\u2026 yeah.", "Uhhh... you really gonna wear the bracelet that's been worn on the decomposing wrist of a corpse for the last 6 months?! \n\nTwo things; get someone else who is a professional to open the grave so you don't have to see the condition the body is in now. And get it professionally cleaned and restored before you wear it.", "I\u2019m literally cracking up. It\u2019s funny because it\u2019s actually illegal to just bury someone without going through the proper channels and somehow this person is unaware?", "Those same religions also require bodies to be buried in the ground not in a wall.", "Thank you for the information! I don\u2019t believe grandma was cremated. OP replied to someone saying grandma is in a casket in the family wall and she can (and might!) call her aunt to open the casket and retrieve the bracelet.", "Because a medical examiner has to issue a death certificate, for one. Check for signs of foul play. No one just grabs a pine box, darts for the family crypt, then moves into their new abode.", "You are not just allowed to privately dispose of bodies, great aunts estate or otherwise.", "Uh\u2026 no. \n\nMy family is from New Orleans. There are plenty of different religious that use mausoleums for various reasons. \n\nEven within the US laws on funerals, options for burial, etc vary from state to state."]}
