Update!", "selftext": "[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/oghjxb/aita_for_selling_out_on_my_grandmas_secret_recipe/)\n\nFirstly, I opened my bakery! I found a great spot near my city's office park/main commuter route to the Big City of a caterer/takeout deli that closed. We've been open since June, and business has been great with all the morning/evening traffic, and the lunch crowd from the business park. We sell cakes, pastries, breads, buns, etc. Typical bakery stuff. I also have a cook who comes in for a few hours in the morning to do eggs & stuff for breakfast sandwiches/wraps for the office folks.\n\nA few weeks after I opened Jane stopped by. She apologized and confirmed what I and others had suspected, she only cared about the cake recipe because she was jealous of my success with my custom cake business. She'd always wanted to work in food, but hated the idea of losing her evenings and working in a high pressure kitchen. So when I suddenly started doing so well, she thought she could do the same but didn't know how to start her own catering business. I apologized too for not wanting to share the recipe, but I was afraid that she would ruin my business by putting out bad cakes and no one would want to buy mine either.\n\nI then offered to have her come in 3 days a week to offer a soup/stew of the day during the lunch rush. I had the extra kitchen space for it, and soups/stews really do suit her style of cooking to taste. She loved the idea and they were an instant hit. She had complete freedom to create whatever 2 kinds of soup she wanted each day, just adding things on a whim, and they were always delicious. They got very popular quickly with the office folks, since there aren't many other take out options nearby without driving about an extra 5-10 minutes out besides two fast food burger places. \n\nWe soon expanded to her coming in every weekday, and then making a cold soup option on Fridays for the Saturday lunch (closed Sundays). It's been a great arrangement, since she keeps her evenings/weekends and gets that creative control. In the last couple weeks we've also started doing take-home heat & serve dishes too like lasagna, chicken/steak taco or sub kits, etc. I'll do the pasta/bread, she does the other prep & sauces. So far they've been very popular.\n\nShe's tried her hand at baking a time or two again, and has declared she just doesn't have the patience for it, and hasn't asked for the recipe again (nor has any other family).\n\nP.S. For those wondering, Grandma had a standing offer for over a year before she died when she wasn't yet sick enough to stop baking, for anyone to come over and she'd personally walk them through the recipe. She was very sad and disappointed that I was the only one who did so. The other bakers would always make excuses about time or say \"later, later\". Shortly before she died she said that since I was the only one who bothered, the recipe was mine now. It's still my best selling cake.", "created_utc": 1668963909, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0996m/aita_for_selling_out_on_my_grandmas_secret_recipe/", "score": 6890, "replies": ["What a great birthday!

I haven't seen many positives come from this sub!", "I\u2019m curious about this cake.  I don\u2019t want the recipe, but can you provide us an idea of what the flavor profile is?  I make a crumble that everyone dies for.  I use cardamom in it.  Usually the full beads and not the powder.  The pop of flavor is what gets people.", "This is great news!

Interesting.", "Good on Jane for realizing she was coming at it from a place of jealousy, and to put in the work to mend the relationship.", "Please do!", "It\u2019s a basic pound cake \u2014 I use Betty Crocker\u2019s golden pound cake recipe with these alterations: buttermilk instead of evaporated milk and 2tsp vanilla extract instead of almond extract. I find that pound cake is dense and rich enough to support a good, strong rum glaze.\n\n\n\u201cSecret\u201d ingredients:\n\n*1 1/4 tsp cardamom (mixed with the dry ingredients)\n\n*1/2 tsp orange extract \n\n*1-2 teaspoons lemon zest (you can use one tablespoon of orange zest instead of the lemon zest and orange extract, but I like the orange extract plus lemon zest better). Do not put orange juice in this recipe. It fucks up the texture. Trust me.\n\n*1/4 cup good rum or bourbon\n\n\nMake pound cake according to Betty\u2019s recipe adding the orange extract, vanilla extract and lemon zest after you cream the butter and sugar. Add the bourbon after you\u2019ve combined the last of the liquid and the dry ingredients. Give the batter a taste. Not all cardamom is created equal so you can add up to a 1/4 teaspoon more. The same goes for your extracts and zests. Be careful. Too much of any one can be overpowering. Bake in Bundt pan according to recipe. Cool in pan for 20-30 mins.\n\nUse a skewer to poke holes all the way through the cake, all the way around, about an inch apart. I do 2 rows: one row about 1 1/2 inches from the edge and the 2nd row about 1 inch from the center. Don\u2019t poke holes willy-nilly. If you have too many holes, your cake will be too wet.\n\n\nAnother tip: wrap the outside of your pan with aluminum foil \u2014 including the flue. Keeps the cake from getting that hard, dry bundt pan crust. I do this now with any cake pan. \n\n\nGlaze: \n\n*1/2 cup (1 stick) butter\n\n*1/2 cup rum or bourbon (whichever you put in the cake batter)\n\n*1 cup sugar\n\n*1/4 tsp orange extract\n\nMelt butter, sugar and water in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to low boil until slightly thickened. Remove from heat. Carefully mix in the rum or bourbon and orange extract.  Let cool slightly and pour about a quarter of a cup all around the edges so that it flows between the cake and the pan. Now, the trick is getting the cake out of the pan. Leave it too long and it will stick. Not leaving it long enough and it will stick. Somewhere between 10-20 mins. *I sometime leave out the orange extract in the glaze. Tastes just as good with/without.\n\nInvert cake onto baking sheet with cake rack. Pour or brush glaze in 1/4 cup amounts every 2-3 hours over the cake, ensuring glaze gets into holes. Cover and let set overnight to allow excess glaze to drain a bit. You don\u2019t want it to sit in a puddle of glaze. It will be too wet. (Unless you like it that way) Transfer to cake stand/plate. It\u2019s ready to eat but it is best a day later when it\u2019s infused more with alcohol. \n\nYou can add crushed nuts to the glaze or sprinkle them on top. Pistachios with rum. Pecans or walnuts with bourbon.\n\nYou can add your alcohol to the boiling glaze if you don\u2019t want a strong alcohol taste. You can also add orange extract and/or lemon juice to powdered sugar and butter to make a nice white drizzle in addition to the alcohol glaze. It\u2019s prettier but it makes it too sweet for my taste. \n\nThis is the pan I use when I take this cake to parties. Only use half the batter. I get 2 cakes from this: one in this pan and one in a small, fancy bundt pan. Also cover the outside of this pan with foil.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06VSSFP6N/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1", "Me four!

My mom's mother was more known for making amazing meats and sides.\n\nWhen my dad's mother passed away, we discovered that most of her recipes weren't in her home -- I don't know where they went, or when, because she had terrible arthritis and didn't bake much in her later years. Nonetheless, we found one cache of recipes and also had ones she'd shared with us over the years, so I created a blog with all of her recipes, any notes she made, little stories about baking with her, etc., and shared it with my family.\n\nMy mom and her sisters recently finished going through the last boxes of their mom's stuff. My mom wound up with her recipe box and discovered not just a ton of great recipes for dinner, but her whole collection of recipes for holiday desserts from Norway and Sweden, where all of my great-grandparents from that side of the family were born. Grandma made those every few years, but they really were cakes and cookies that my mom and her siblings associate with THEIR grandmothers. As a treat, I have helped my mom create a comprehensive cookbook (100+ pages) of all of her recipes. We're getting bound and printed copies for my grandma's children, and after the holidays, I'm going to make a PDF printable available for my extended family (23 first cousins, all the descendants of my grandma's 7 siblings, etc.). I'm pretty excited to get to share this with everyone -- or realistically, to smile and watch my mom share it with everyone on Facebook. LOL", "With how many people claim to have the right answer to what happens after death, and every one of them lacking tangible proof, I think it's best to treat people well during the life we know exists. And to let people know they matter before they go.\n\nI don't claim to have the answer, for the record. I just want everybody to really think about what they do and how they treat people in this life. Being kind often costs us very little in the grand scheme of things.", "Please tell us where your bakery is so we can come try this food!", "I\u2019m so happy for you and that\u2019s so exciting! I\u2019m so glad that you\u2019ve been able to find something that works for you both and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve made her really happy!\n\nNAH", "It's so refreshing to see a happy ending on here! Congratulations on the bakery's success :)", "What a great ending to your story! I\u2019m so happy for both of you", "Aw this is sweet! \n\nCongrats to both of you!! \n\n(But especially you for keeping your cool and opening a business haha)", "Amir the only one who wants to try the cake", "Upon seeing the title I was like wow. Then I actually read it and I\u2019m saying wow for a completely different reason. Definitely NTA and congratulations!", "AWH (All Winners Here) ??", "If you\u2019re ever left alone with that recipe box. I hope you have your cellphone (camera) with you!", "That did it, you made them have to go back to the er", "Hallmark needs to make this a movie! Great it all worked out!", "Monetizing grandmas recipe. Nice.", "Oh my, I love this so much!! Congrats on the bakery and your success! I really hope that you make bread bowls to serve Jane's soup in for those who would like, that is always the best! Best wishes to you and your cousin and continued success!", "You\u2019re a good person. Love this update!", "Such a lovely resolution! A rare sight these days \n\nAaaaand now I'm overly curious about that recipe \ud83e\udd23", "Man that is rough.  So sorry.", "I did see your removed comment.  I know the type all too well and you have my sympathies.\n\nBut don't give up hope, sometimes that sort likes to keep something safely hidden so they get the joy of having what others want and/or should rightfully have.  I shall keep my fingers crossed that this is the case and she is well distracted elsewhere when you stumble across it.", "Grandma's last Christmas. I asked Grandpa if I could either borrow the recipe book, or he could e-mail the files to me so I could print copies for the whole family. He insisted she wouldn't like that. WELP, guess what my AH mother gave the family that year. The cookies. And JUST the cookies. I was BIG mad, but grateful I had those, at least. I always looked forward to baking with her for the holidays, and without her...it's just not the same. But my kid is now big enough to want to help, so I can give him those memories, too. \n\nWhen grandpa passed the following year, I got the recipe book. The whole book.\n\nThe bound recipes were all typed by my grandfather, and proofread by grandma before they were bound into the book, but I have the original copies, too. Loose pages clipped from old magazines, newspapers, and the very early days of the internet. It makes me smile that they included stuff like \"family member's favorite\" after the title. I recognize her handwriting, of course, and those make me sad and happy that I have that. And I recognize my AH mother and her siblings handwriting, too. But there are other recipes in other hands I don't know, and wish I did. I'm sure I have recipes no one else has at all-like a recipe from my cousin's mother, who passed when she was far too young. It's a family favorite, and Grandma made it every holiday for decades after Aunt passed. I'm not even sure if my cousin, her only child, has that recipe. If I had the recipe in her handwriting, I would give it to her. But sadly, I don't. I DO have the copy grandpa so dutifully typed.", "[removed]", "Lol I can't believe they fuckin removed my comment\n\nOh, and they also mocked me over messages then fully banned me for saying their judgement was wrong but I'll change it. \n\nJust want to make it clear how the mods treat people here.\n\nBut they're gonna remove this comment to hide their actions like they always do \ud83e\udd17", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
