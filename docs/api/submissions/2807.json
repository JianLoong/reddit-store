Update!", "selftext": "[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/oghjxb/aita_for_selling_out_on_my_grandmas_secret_recipe/)\n\nFirstly, I opened my bakery! I found a great spot near my city's office park/main commuter route to the Big City of a caterer/takeout deli that closed. We've been open since June, and business has been great with all the morning/evening traffic, and the lunch crowd from the business park. We sell cakes, pastries, breads, buns, etc. Typical bakery stuff. I also have a cook who comes in for a few hours in the morning to do eggs & stuff for breakfast sandwiches/wraps for the office folks.\n\nA few weeks after I opened Jane stopped by. She apologized and confirmed what I and others had suspected, she only cared about the cake recipe because she was jealous of my success with my custom cake business. She'd always wanted to work in food, but hated the idea of losing her evenings and working in a high pressure kitchen. So when I suddenly started doing so well, she thought she could do the same but didn't know how to start her own catering business. I apologized too for not wanting to share the recipe, but I was afraid that she would ruin my business by putting out bad cakes and no one would want to buy mine either.\n\nI then offered to have her come in 3 days a week to offer a soup/stew of the day during the lunch rush. I had the extra kitchen space for it, and soups/stews really do suit her style of cooking to taste. She loved the idea and they were an instant hit. She had complete freedom to create whatever 2 kinds of soup she wanted each day, just adding things on a whim, and they were always delicious. They got very popular quickly with the office folks, since there aren't many other take out options nearby without driving about an extra 5-10 minutes out besides two fast food burger places. \n\nWe soon expanded to her coming in every weekday, and then making a cold soup option on Fridays for the Saturday lunch (closed Sundays). It's been a great arrangement, since she keeps her evenings/weekends and gets that creative control. In the last couple weeks we've also started doing take-home heat & serve dishes too like lasagna, chicken/steak taco or sub kits, etc. I'll do the pasta/bread, she does the other prep & sauces. So far they've been very popular.\n\nShe's tried her hand at baking a time or two again, and has declared she just doesn't have the patience for it, and hasn't asked for the recipe again (nor has any other family).\n\nP.S. For those wondering, Grandma had a standing offer for over a year before she died when she wasn't yet sick enough to stop baking, for anyone to come over and she'd personally walk them through the recipe. She was very sad and disappointed that I was the only one who did so. The other bakers would always make excuses about time or say \"later, later\". Shortly before she died she said that since I was the only one who bothered, the recipe was mine now. It's still my best selling cake.", "created_utc": 1668963909, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0996m/aita_for_selling_out_on_my_grandmas_secret_recipe/", "score": 3290, "replies": ["What a great birthday!

This whole posting seems like gluten ablism.  j/k and I am sorry, but I am not politically correct.", "Except the grandmother, who was sad that no one else wanted her cake recipe.", "I would sell my soul for another day with my grandmother. I\u2019m not a baker, but I do have her cookie recipe. It\u2019s never quite the same, but it\u2019s comforting to have a little bit of her genius written down in four places and saved to several hard drives and clouds.", "Same! I'm just starting to get into baking and I've always loved the idea of baking stuff with a story - I'd kill to know what the spice combination is. I just think there's a certain whimsy to being able to bake a cake based on one that a stranger's granny halfway across the world came up with", "Goddamnit, I just had surgery and it hurts so bad to laugh. I have to keep hopping off Reddit cuz y\u2019all are so funny I\u2019m gonna pop a stitch and wind up in the ER.

I am really happy for OP and her cousin, this is a lovely update but also I want to know about the cake.", "But she doesn't know that.  All she knew was decades of everyone loving her cake, then when she offered to share the recipe, everyone but OP saying 'nah'.", "And just like that, I know what all the aunts, uncles, and cousins are getting for the holidays! Thank you :)", "I'm guessing it's a German style coffee cake (eat with coffee, not tastes of) - they're quite spiced \ud83d\ude0b", "Ok but like why did you say in your last post that you would give the recipe to any children/grandchildren who wanted it. Then when you were asked for it you said no because they didn't ask before your grandma died? That's messed up.", "That's really sweet.", "This is absolutely the best resolution I\u2019ve ever read in this sub. \n\nWish you two many years as a successful business. \n\nWish I could hit y\u2019all up.", "Op where is your bakery? I would love to join", "What a fabulous update!!! I am so happy for you and 'Jane!'

I\u2019m so happy that it worked out for you!", "I love the update. So glad you 2 were able to come together and make a business that works!   Alot of people don't get that cooking is art and baking is more science.  Not every good cook is a baker and not every good baker is a cook lol", "I wanna try the cake now.", "I want some of this cake now. Do you ship? Are you anywhere near Michigan? It sure sounds like it's worth a road trip.", "Good job!", "Aww that is amazing! Love how this worked out!\n\nSoup and stew are excellent to make by taste but there's really no feasible way for this to work with baking.", "So happy for an awesome update and upcoming.  I haven't seen many positives come from this sub!", "I\u2019m curious about this cake.  I don\u2019t want the recipe, but can you provide us an idea of what the flavor profile is?  I make a crumble that everyone dies for.  I use cardamom in it.  Usually the full beads and not the powder.  The pop of flavor is what gets people.", "This is great news! I'm glad you and Jane were able to work everything out.\n\nCould you also DM me the name of your bakery and the location if I'm ever in your city? Lol", "Great update!!", "Congratulations! What\u2019s the name of your place, if you don\u2019t mind me asking. Everything sounds so delicious and I\u2019d love to stop by and try a slice of your grandmother\u2019s cake and a bowl of soup.", "What a good ending to the story. Hell yeah", "Congratulations on not only fulfilling your dream but your Grandma's as well. So glad that Jane came to you and you gave her the chance to create her dream as well. I hope you both have many years of continuing success.", "I love this! Glad that everything turned out great for you guys. Good luck!", "What a terrific update.  Your grandma would be so very proud of you, OP.", "This was a beautiful update, it's refreshing to see things turn around for everyone for the better. Sorry about your grandma, that brought a tear to my eye. I miss my grandma, she supported my love of baking. \nHope your business keeps growing!!", "Is there any sub where people can post their business? If so you could post it there because a lot us want to taste your grandmas recipe! Please tell us!", "This such an incredibly wholesome story, and it's fantastic that you've both found this success. Would genuinely love this as a film, the kind you watch when you're feeling sad and just need something to give you a warm fuzzy feeling. Congrats!!", "It really is great reading a successful  positive conclusion to one of these.", "I wish I would\u2019ve been old enough to learn all of the cooking/baking secrets before my grandma got sick and eventually passed away. I got what I could at a young age and she definitely sparked my love for cooking/baking but still so much I could\u2019ve absorbed. I still have her recipe box.", "Me too!! I don't travel as much but I want to know if it's a place I can get to.", "Me three! I'd much prefer to support a local business when I go somewhere, plus those make more memorable experiences.", "I personally would just love it printed and framed.", "Lol thats why they said would be not is.", "I'm sure she does!", "They'll also carve them into cutting boards if that's more your style (though perhaps not for a cookie recipe?) Etsy has great options!"]}
