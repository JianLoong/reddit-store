Sometimes I end up keeping them if a permanent home isn't found.  Right now, I have 2 blind dogs that I have adopted after fostering, and one 3-legged dog that I am fostering.\n\nMy husband (40M) and I (39F) live in a small house since it's just the 2 of us and the dogs. We don't need a lot of space but we do have a nice yard for the dogs to play in.  We only have 2 bedrooms and one of them is pretty much the dogs' room.  I've found that my blind dogs feel much more comfortable when they have their own familiar space so I pretty much made that room all theirs.  We don't really have guests so it's never been an issue before.\n\nA couple months ago, my husband's cousin got in touch with my husband after years of not seeing each other.  They were really close growing up and the cousin wanted to reconnect.  My husband ended up inviting the cousin and his wife to come visit us.  When my husband brought this up to me, I told him I don't mind visitors, but I don't feel comfortable moving the dogs out of their room and rearranging things in there so his guests can take the room, it would be too stressful for the dogs.\n\nHe tried to convince me that it would only be for a couple nights and the dogs will adjust, but I insisted that the dogs' room stay as it is.  He told his cousin about this and his cousin ended up getting a hotel instead.  My husband was not happy about this.\n\nThey visited this past weekend and instead of coming over to our house to visit, my husband told his cousin that he would just meet them in the downtown area they were staying in so they could explore the city.  My husband told me that since they were planning on spending the entire day out on the town, that I should stay home and watch the dogs since they can't be alone for that long.\n\nI told him that I want to go out on the town too, but he told me that I would have to Uber home because he's not going to want to come home.  I don't drive so we couldn't take two cars.  This made me feel extremely left out and I told my husband so.\n\nHe told me that since I am prioritizing the dogs over his cousin, he is going to make sure that he still gets to spend as much time as possible with his cousin since they aren't staying with us.  He reiterated that I can join, but that I'm going to need to take an Uber home to take care of the dogs.\n\nI ended up just staying home because I didn't want to take an Uber by myself.  My husband ended up spending a full 12 hours out with his cousin while I sat at home.  When he got back I told him how upset I was that he left me out of all the fun they had.  He said this was the situation I created by not even trying to let his cousin stay with us.\n\nHe said that his cousin told him they felt a little put out by having to get a hotel after they were invited to stay with us, especially given the reason.  He said he had to apologize on my behalf so it was probably better I stayed home anyway.\n\nEDIT: The reason I didn't want to take an Uber is because I was in a bad accident years ago and I have severe anxiety related to driving and being in a car with people I'm not familiar with.  My husband knows this and I feel like his suggestion to take an Uber was an option he gave knowing that I wouldn't be able to do it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2:  The amount of vitriol on this post related to my trauma is disgusting and disturbing.  I hope that no one else ever has to experience what I did that led to my trauma and anxiety.  And to see it be used as a punchline and dismissed so easily is really disheartening.  To all of you who feel the need to chastise me for having trauma, bless your heart.", "created_utc": 1673983513, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ekwlc/aita_for_not_giving_my_husbands_guests_the_spare/", "score": 1048, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The consequences of your choices. You made your priorities clear, and are now somehow upset that they were accommodated? \n\nYTA. I would have said N A H, but you are now blaming your husband for a situation you created.", "You're not necessarily the asshole for not allowing his cousin (and wife) to use the guest room. It wouldn't be the choice *I'd* make, but I'd think they'd probably *prefer* not to stay in a room that had \"gone to the dogs.\"\n\nBut YTA for getting upset that \"he left you out of all the fun they had.\" \n\n1. It was *your* decision that led the cousins to stay in the downtown area. \n2. You weren't \"left out.\" Your husband only said he was going to spend the entire day downtown with his cousin. He didn't want to leave early, so if you joined them and needed to go home to take care of the dogs at any point, you'd need to take an Uber. \n3. You stayed home because \"you didn't want to take an Uber by yourself.\"\n\nSo, you made your bed, and now are angry that you had to lie on it.", "YTA You weren't excluded from the outing with your husband and his cousin. You chose not to go because your husband told you he wasn't going to cut his day out with his cousin short to drive you home to tend to the dogs. You decided you didn't want to take an Uber alone and opted to stay home.", "NAH / YTA. \n\nI'm having a really hard time understanding the problem here. \n\n- You don't drive.\n- Your pets cannot be left alone more than a couple hours. \n- Your husband offered to include you as much as possible.\n- You declined because you wanted to be part of ALL the fun or NONE of it. \n\nThis is a situation of your own making? If you wanted to go out on the town for all the fun, you needed to get a dog sitter? Your husband is not obliged to only leave the house in 2-hour chunks for the rest of his life? What did you expect him to do, only see his cousin for 2 hours and then leave?", "YTA - you wouldn\u2019t let his cousin stay with you, you don\u2019t drive and rely on your husband to drive you, you won\u2019t take an Uber, and you insist on going back to take care of the dogs. So the options were for your husband to be forced to take you back to take care of the dogs, or you stay home. He\u2019s right, you put yourself in this situation and you were completely unreasonable. You didn\u2019t have to let them stay with you, but trying to force your husband to leave to transport you is too far.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how so many people on this sub say \u201cI don\u2019t drive\u201d, and it\u2019s not a financial thing it\u2019s just a \u201cI choose not to, and force everyone to cater to my transportation needs.\u201d You made that bed by not driving, so you get to lie in it by using public transport or not doing things. Choosing not to drive and forcing others to drive you around is the most asshole move I see here", "YTA. What exactly were you thinking would happen? Your husband would be ok with driving you home to check on the dogs then driving back? His cousin was only there for a couple of days. Also what is your problem taking an Uber alone? You created this situation and I know it\u2019s important to take care of the dogs but this is the consequence of not compromising.", "YTA because of the way you treated your husband after making this decision. By not allowing them to stay in the spare room, your husband maximized his time with his cousin outside of the house. That meant he would be out of the house for the whole day. Because of your choice not to drive or take an Uber, you decided not to go because again you prioritized the dogs. You could have planned getting a dog sitter. Or taken the Uber. Or you could have just owned your decision to prioritize your dogs over your husbands cousins visit. You being upset that he \u201cleft [you] out of all the fun they had\u201d was fully and solely a result of your own decisions.", "YTA. He told you you were prioritizing the dogs over his cousin\u2026. You absolutely were. You\u2019re an adult, if you wanted to be involved you could have taken the Uber, or gotten a ride from a friend, or taken the bus, or anything!!\n\nYeah\u2026 your 2nd edit where you try and play the victim card clearly shows that you haven\u2019t learned anything", "YTA.\n\nYou clearly don't think of your husband as your partner, or that he has any equal say in your household. Then you get upset because he does things outside of your house?  That's on you.", "YTA. People are focused a lot on the driving but I haven't seen this mentioned: you have multiple dogs and are active in the foster/adoption community. You really don't know anyone who could have dog-sat for a few hours so you could join them without having to worry about Ubers or someone driving you back and forth?", "YTA you didn\u2019t work with him at all to host his guest why should he work with you to have fun? You created this situation", "YTA he met your request and then you refused to compromise because you're not grown up enough to Uber alone?  And then you guilt trip over it?  That's some toxic behavior", "YTA", "Wait, what? YOU made the choice, OP. You had to have a pretty good idea how this was going to go if the cousin wasn\u2019t a guest in your home. Did you expect them to come and hang at a house where weren\u2019t really welcome?\n\nYTA.", "I'm kind of coming down on a soft YTA here, because you're kind of expecting everyone to accommodate your choices. \n\nYou decided to unilaterally block one room in your shared house for your dogs. \n\nYou don't drive, you don't want to uber. Is public transportation an option?\n\nYou didn't arrange for someone else, like a neighbour, to come in and take care of the dogs. \n\nNone of this makes you an asshole. But then you expected your husband to drive you into town, have a shorter visit with his cousin than he wanted and drive you back when you had to leave. And that's really a lot to ask.", "YTA- I\u2019m definitely an animal lover but I can\u2019t see not moving dogs to a different room and allowing company to use it. I\u2019m 100% sure the dogs WILL BE FINE.  You sound annoyingly helpless and dependent. There\u2019s just no pleasing you unless you\u2019re being entirely disruptive.", "YTA.\n\nNot for letting the cousins in your home. But for making a big deal of not going out when you could've just gone home separately. He's maybe a slight a holee for the comment about the dogs needing to have someone home, but he's right about the offered solution. Youre an adult. Take an Uber. \n\nWhy don't you want to take an Uber by yourself?", "YTA because of the Uber. Dogs are creatures of habit and special needs dogs that have been shuffled around can be moreso. They should keep their room. You put the dogs\u2019 comfort before the cousin. I think that was the right thing to do. That said, you should have joined them for as much of the day as you could. If I were the cousin I would be understanding about the dogs but not with you not coming because you didn\u2019t feel like taking an Uber.", "Mild YTA. You care about the dogs more than the guest, it stands to reason that you wouldn't be prioritised by the guests - it's perfectly OK to say that a 'guest room' is a dog's room but don't expect the guest to feel welcome!\n\nAlso there seem to be  a lot of restrictions on your movement. Why can't you take an Uber home? You're the one that insists the dogs needs are paramount, what's wrong with going home to tend to them? It seems ridiculous to ban your cousin from your house AND ban your husband from seeing him any longer than you can AND not to be willing to take an Uber to join them.\n\nMaybe not really an AH per se, you essentially just don't have a guest bedroom I guess, but I don't know what else you expected from people. Not an AH for not giving them a room really, but definitely for then feeling entitled that everyone would make accommodations for you.", "YTA.  This was the consequence of your decision. You were inflexible and treat your husband as if he has no agency in his own home. \n\nHe did invite you, and it\u2019s a bit helpless of you to decline taking an Uber since you don\u2019t drive. So your choice to stay home. Yet you blame him for all of your choices, choices which would have taken him from seeing his cousin. Be mad at yourself. \n\nAt least he hasn\u2019t asked you to go sleep in your dogs\u2019 room.", "YTA- Learn to drive.", "YTA - you create a no-win situation, and then feel left out?", "YTA\n\nYou refused to house his cousin because it would disrupt the dogs. Fair enough.\n\nHusband & cousin hatch alternative plans. Those plans involve more time away from the house than the dogs can be left alone,  requiring you to either stay home or peel off early to fulfill the commitment *you* made to the dogs. (Or ask someone else in the rescue community to fill in for you)\n\nYou then refuse those options because you don't want to miss out on the fun but also can't/won't be responsible for your own transportation.  I get it that you have some significant anxiety surrounding cars but your anxiety doesn't mean everyone else's life must accommodate your wishes at every turn. \n\nYou foster and adopt special needs pets  and that limits your ability to be away from home for long periods. \n\nYou don't drive. \n\nYou won't Uber.\n\nYour husband wanted to spend some time reconnecting with a family member he hadn't seen in years and you're sulking?\n\nNo. Your not being a part of the outing is *entirely* the result of your decisions.", "YTA. Why didn't you just take the Uber? Wtf?", "YTA. He followed your wishes and left the room to the dogs. He did not purposely exclude you from the day. He never gets to see his cousin, you couldn\u2019t give him this one day? Not everything is about you and the dogs.", "YTA. Your husband made concessions for your comfort, now it\u2019s your turn. \n\nAsk a friend to drive you, drive separate, or take public transport.", "There is no winning with you, YTA", "You\u2019re not TA for not wanting to give them the dogs\u2019 room, especially since your husband offered without speaking with you first, but you are TA for the rest of it. I get that it sucks you were left out, but it\u2019s perfectly understandable that your husband wanted to spend as much time with his cousin as he could, and he\u2019s right that you put yourself in this situation.", "YTA - OP is perfectly free to make her disabled dogs the center of her world. The thing is most people are going to think you are one of those crazy pet people. Also the refusal to both drive and take an Uber sounds exhausting for the husband to deal with.", "YTA - I respect your love and care for your special needs dogs, however your husband is your partner and should have some say in the household as well.  It is not like he was asking to have the dogs removed in order to bring the guests in, he was just hoping for a little bit of accommodation.\n\nIf you can't accommodate your husband and his family members, why does he have to accommodate your need to be included?  Your anxiety issues with being in an Uber alone are also not his problem - he offered you a solution and you, as an adult, chose not to take it.", "YTA", "YTA I was in a bad accident where I\u2019m disabled and use a walker I still drive and take Ubers. You seem exhausting.", "You ain't the asshole. But he makes a fair point. It's a compromise you have to deal with. That's what relationships are about. Your partner values his relationship with his cousin that's important too him. You prioritize the dogs, which is fine. But then you have to deal with the consequences of said choice. You can't make him feel bad. He gave you options to join.", "YTA, you didn't want to compromise. This is entirely a problem because you made it a problem. You could've re-arranged the dogs in a way to accommodate his cousin, but you didn't, you dug in and wanted the cake, and eat it too. The dogs would've been fine displaced a couple days, and you weren't being a very accommodating host.", "I agree with your husband \u2026you wouldn\u2019t accommodate him or his cousin but then expected to be accommodated yourself for something you created .

You had other options YTA", "You made what (to you) was a logical choice and the consequences of that choice were to inconvenience the cousin, hurt their and your husband's feelings, and miss out on a fun day. \n\nYou made the dog's bed, you can lie in it \n\nDid it never occur to you to sleep in the dog's room and give your room to the guests? \n\nYTA", "INFO: how far away from your home are they going out? Is it a short drive? Could he have not just brought you home and gone back out?\n\nNTA for not wanting the cousin to stay.

I don\u2019t feel comfortable having people in my home I don\u2019t know anyway, let alone for days at a time.   \n\nThat saying, if it wasn\u2019t that far for an Uber to take you from where they were staying to where you live, you might be TA. I get having fears and anxieties about certain things, been on anxiety medication for about 17 years now. I dunno the extent of your anxiety, so I can\u2019t really judge based on that alone. But it seems like he tried to compromise here. At least on this part. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of crappy to say he had to apologize because he cousin felt put out that they had to stay at a hotel. Like, that wouldn\u2019t have even been an issue if he had just consulted you first.", "YTA", "Nta but you have to accept the results of your decisions.

They can wind up injured. If your husband knows this very basic fact about blind animal care, he should not have offered up the dogs' room in the first place.

If so, time to have a discussion about that. It seems like some kind of resentment about the animals is subtext in this dispute that's supposedly about the cousin.

Your husband is TA bc he\u2019s clearly excluding you because of this", "I read your comment about being in a traumatic accident and being uncomfortable in cars with people you don't trust so I'm going to say NTA. Sounds like your husband was being difficult as \"payback\" for you refusing to move the dogs when he has to know about your trauma and why an uber isn't reasonable for you.\n\nMy old roommate had a blind dog and I know how much they rely on their surroundings being the same. Suddenly not being allowed somewhere or being moved to a new place could be very distressing and they could hurt themselves. Very reasonable not to give up the room, and it's your husband's fault for offering it without asking you.", "NTA Well, if it isn\u2019t the old tit for tat. Petty retaliation hasn\u2019t been proven to serve as a bedrock of a healthy relationship, so his behavior is disappointing.

Your dogs would have been okay for two days. But, his response was ugly.", "NTA.  As I too live in a house where we foster (and have many of our own) animals. I know exactly all too well how animals take to the safe space that is our spare bedroom.  In fact, currently, every morning that I get up I find our current \"bedroom dweller\" in that bedroom tucked away in her \"safe spot\".  Our house is unique that we can let her roam free while keeping the rest of the animals constrained to the other half of the home and she does come out and explore, especially at night, but she always retreats when she encounters any duress at all and it's always to that bedroom and to her spot.\n\nOnce we were forced to convert the room to a bedroom for a time out of necessity for my wife's very old grandmother and removing the safe place was not an easy conversion for the animal or for us.  In fact, it was very traumatizing for the animal however we were able to recover her from that.\n\nOn the other hand it seems like your husband is an AH for using this as some form of retaliation against you.

Sometimes I end up keeping them if a permanent home isn't found.  Right now, I have 2 blind dogs that I have adopted after fostering, and one 3-legged dog that I am fostering.  \n\nMy husband (40M) and I (39F) live in a small house since it's just the 2 of us and the dogs. We don't need a lot of space but we do have a nice yard for the dogs to play in.  We only have 2 bedrooms and one of them is pretty much the dogs' room.  I've found that my blind dogs feel much more comfortable when they have their own familiar space so I pretty much made that room all theirs.  We don't really have guests so it's never been an issue before.\n\nA couple months ago, my husband's cousin got in touch with my husband after years of not seeing each other.  They were really close growing up and the cousin wanted to reconnect.  My husband ended up inviting the cousin and his wife to come visit us.  When my husband brought this up to me, I told him I don't mind visitors, but I don't feel comfortable moving the dogs out of their room and rearranging things in there so his guests can take the room, it would be too stressful for the dogs.  \n\nHe tried to convince me that it would only be for a couple nights and the dogs will adjust, but I insisted that the dogs' room stay as it is.  He told his cousin about this and his cousin ended up getting a hotel instead.  My husband was not happy about this.  \n\nThey visited this past weekend and instead of coming over to our house to visit, my husband told his cousin that he would just meet them in the downtown area they were staying in so they could explore the city.  My husband told me that since they were planning on spending the entire day out on the town, that I should stay home and watch the dogs since they can't be alone for that long.  \n\nI told him that I want to go out on the town too, but he told me that I would have to Uber home because he's not going to want to come home.  I don't drive so we couldn't take two cars.  This made me feel extremely left out and I told my husband so.  \n\nHe told me that since I am prioritizing the dogs over his cousin, he is going to make sure that he still gets to spend as much time as possible with his cousin since they aren't staying with us.  He reiterated that I can join, but that I'm going to need to take an Uber home to take care of the dogs.\n\nI ended up just staying home because I didn't want to take an Uber by myself.  My husband ended up spending a full 12 hours out with his cousin while I sat at home.  When he got back I told him how upset I was that he left me out of all the fun they had.  He said this was the situation I created by not even trying to let his cousin stay with us.  \n\nHe said that his cousin told him they felt a little put out by having to get a hotel after they were invited to stay with us, especially given the reason.  He said he had to apologize on my behalf so it was probably better I stayed home anyway.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You vetoed his guests, fair enough you had good reason. But that means he needed to be outside the house to socialize with those guests. You asking him to interrupt that time yet further to drive you around is too much. If it was important to you to socialize with the cousins, you needed to figure out the logistics yourself instead of putting it all on your husband. Hindsight is 20/20, but off the top of my head you could have asked another trusted friend for a ride, gotten somebody else from your rescue/foster org to look in on the dogs, or researched (and paid for) a fun activity that would bring the whole group close to home at the right time for you to walk home for your dog chores. You did none of that and just kind of pouted? Not great.", "ESH. Not wanting to move the dogs is reasonable, and it's your husband's own fault his cousin felt put out since he invited them without discussing it with you. \n\nThat being said, your husband has given up the ability to have family stay over for the dogs. That's a big sacrifice, and it is unreasonable to expect him to *also* cut his visit with his cousin short for them. You are being selfish.", "Well well well. How the turntables have turntabled.

No you stay home and watch your dogs.", "YTA You put yourself in this situation. Expecting everyone else to cater to your wants and needs is a bit ridiculous. You didn\u2019t want to give up the room, a little unreasonable personally but fine. Then you want your husband to chauffeur you back and forth from the city, limiting his time with family? I really don\u2019t understand what you wanted him to do.", "YTA You made the rules without being willing to compromise. You foster dogs. You made a room for just them.

Right?\n\nSo what is it you would have your husband do?  Cut his visit to 4 or 6 hours so that he can drive you home to care for the dogs?\n\nI think you did enough.

But you have a living room or other space if you want to make room for family (long lost cousin). You didn\u2019t offer it.\n\nThe dogs require maintenance and you don\u2019t drive. That\u2019s on you and not your spouse to figure it out. Spouse gave an option, but you turned it down. \n\nI don\u2019t know an ending that would have made you happy. You shut down options. And the world doesn\u2019t revolve around your needs and your dogs \ud83d\udc15 needs. \n\nIf you were out on the town would you have soaked up the fun or put a damper on it? It\u2019s best you stayed home.", "YTA\n\nI get it. Dogs are a major priority for people, and that\u2019s fine. However, I think having the dogs adjust for a couple days so your husband could spend time with his cousin would have been fine. I think he was wrong to offer your place without consulting you first, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough for an E S H ruling. \n\nYou had options, and chose not to use them. You chose to be petty as an \u201call or nothing\u201d type of deal, which isn\u2019t fair to anyone. You chose to make his cousin get a hotel. That\u2019s fine. You both (presumably) own the house and should get a say. However, you chose not to go because \u201cyou don\u2019t drive\u201d. Which I get, traumatic accidents can lead to that. However, Uber was an option. Getting a dog sitter was an option. Getting a friend/family member to watch them was an option. \n\nJust because you had a traumatic experience does not mean everyone needs to adjust their life to suit your needs. If you can\u2019t drive because of anxiety, what would happen if your husband got rushed to the ER while he was out? What if his car broke down and he needed help? If your fear of driving is that bad, then I\u2019d suggest counseling/therapy to help if you\u2019ve not explored that. Driving is a key part of life for many people, and by choosing not to drive you\u2019re limiting yourself greatly.\n\nEdit: I also want to add, this coming from a dude who\u2019s dog is his world and also has severe anxiety. It\u2019s nice when others can do something to assist with it, but I don\u2019t expect folks to plan their lives around it. It\u2019s my struggle, my battle. Not theirs. Asking them to always adjust to it wouldn\u2019t be fair to them.", "YTA. You had options, you made choices.

Your husband was definitely being petty/punishing you for refusing to let his cousin use the guest room by setting up an itinerary that he probably knew you would object to. But you're also to blame for making a fuss over the visit not being planned according to your personal demands and desires when it wasn't about you in the first place--it was about your husband reconnecting with his cousin.", "YTA.\nNot about the dog of course, it\u2019s you about your audacity. \n\nIt is your choice to let him go out without you. He literally said you can come, but he knows you aren\u2019t prioritizing his cousin. He understand that. \nAnd you have the audacity to tell him that you felt left out? When you yourself left yourself out?  \n\nWhattt", "Yta, I feel like taking in these animals have hurt you and your husband\u2019s relationship, also the thing about not driving isn\u2019t realistic.

Seems to me you\u2019re expecting an awful lot of your husband.  Yes, you have some anxieties and phobias.  Let\u2019s say it again, YOU have some anxieties and phobias. Good that you\u2019re working on that, but to expect your husband to limit *his* life because of your needs is pretty selfish.  You might be the costar, but you are not playing the leading role in *his* life.  From the sound of it, he is generally supportive of you and doesn\u2019t do this kind of thing often.

I will not judge you for those things, but the reality is that we all make choices. By choosing to have dogs that need a lot of care- which is admirable- it limits how long you can be away. By choosing to put the stress of the dogs over having overnight guests, it limits how much your husband can visit with his cousin. \n\nYou made a bunch of choices, including to decline your husband's request to have his cousin stay with you.

It's essential for blind animals to have familiar surroundings.

Even so, at some point there may be an emergency situation that will require you to confront your anxiety. It might be worth working with a therapist, if you haven't already tried this. At the very least, consider that your husband might be feeling crowded out by yours and your animals' needs. That might explain why he's treating you this way. I understand that you felt left out by your husband going out with his cousin, but it's not always going to be easy to make arrangements that meet all of these needs simultaneously. He's definitely in the wrong for how he set this situation up, but he's not wrong for wanting to cherish the time spent connecting with his cousin. I'm going to guess that in his mind having the cousin stay with you would have been the easiest option for you in the long run. But again -- he didn't discuss it with you first. Anyway, I can see it not being super convenient to accommodate his desire, your cousin's needs, and your schedule. So this is one of those situations where you cannot win for losing.

And it sounds like they never agreed that the dog room wouldn't be able to be used by anyone but the dogs. \n\nYeah, he should have asked about inviting them, but I don't see how the day he and his cousin spent together would have turned out any differently anyway. They didn't stay at the house. OP would have been in the same situation if husband had said \"hey cousin is going to be in town for the weekend and I'm going to hang out with them on Saturday.\" OP would still have had to figure out a way to get home or not go to take care of her dogs.", "I personally would never offer up our home without checking with my spouse first. If you half-offer and your spouse says no, then they become the \"bad guy\" and you have to let down the person you offered to.\n\nBut, my living situation is more like OP. 2 bedrooms - one of which has a purpose other than guest room, small home, and very infrequent guests. I do know people who have guests all the time and for them I imagine it's less of a discussion and more of a \"check in\" where you can assume the spouse will say yes because they always have in the past.\n\nI do think OP's husband may have valid concerns about the room situation. Overnight guests being permanently off the table, if the husband would like to start having people over, is also something to be discussed. But I see this as a separate issue.", "I did mean blind. Just because they can't see the room doesn't mean they don't know how to navigate it. If they start walking around as though things were in a specific spot, they could get hurt and will definitely get scared because they won't be able to locate themselves, or their food, or anything.", "To be fair, if a room is dedicated to multiple dogs, it might be a pain in the ass to clean and be suitable for guests. \n\nOP makes it sound like he is condescending, but that might just be her projecting. So, I can't say if he is using this to punish her by going out without her. \n\nTruthfully, this could all be avoided, but they didn't talk. Like, at all.", "Trustworthy childcare is so important and when we\u2019re ready for a dog I will do the same and find emergency care for any pets we get. Isn\u2019t that like bare minimum? I get these dogs are special needs but there should always be at least a plan just in case.", "We had an incident with my in-laws a few years back so we had to set that up when they were in kinder & 2nd grade, they\u2019re 2nd & 4th now but it\u2019ll be a good idea to revisit that and make sure they still know it", "Husband compromised by uninviting his cousins after his wife said no. What else would you have him do?", "Husband also decided cousin had to be visited entirely away from the house. Could they not have visited in their home, and just returned to their hotel to sleep? I don't understand why people are assuming being away from home all day was his only option just because she didn't want to set up a sleeping space for them in the home? It's like he purposely created a scenario she'd entirely miss out on out of spite.", "Agreed.", "Oh no my  trauma is more important than your fun \n\nThat mentality sucks", "I\u2019m really surprised at all the Y T A votes - to me it reads very clearly like husband was punishing OP for not being willing to kick the dogs out (and the odds that the dogs would be anxious or have accidents in this scenario are really high, and wouldn\u2019t that have been just lovely with houseguests?). OP thought they could get a hotel to sleep but still visit at the house, but husband decided they were going to go out and planned it so that OP either had to stay home or do something that really upsets her - all with these pointed little comments about the dogs.  And all of this is after he invited people she\u2019s never met to sleep in their house without even discussing it with her, and just assumed both she and the dogs would just have to deal.  \n\nAnd now he\u2019s making it out that it was her own fault she was excluded and that the cousins were upset with her anyway so better she wasn\u2019t there.\n\nI know this term gets overused here, but he\u2019s gaslighting her, and a fair number of you, too.  \n\nNTA at all.", "My guess is that these two don't have the greatest communication skills.", "Well he did mention it. its not like the cousin showed up out the blue. She is 100% the problem.", "Eh, it depends. I've had friends and family come visit that didn't necessarily give the expectation of hosting. Obviously, cousin has never been hosted there before. OP didn't clarify how well established the plans were. They could have still been at the stage of snowballing \"hey, you should come visit\" and asked first. If we're just assuming, then let's assume she commandeered the room in the first place without discussion because she said \" I foster dogs\" and not \"we\".\n\nHe definitely was being petty later though allowing her to lie in the bed she made. I agree with that.", "Of course they don't. They've never driven anywhere before", "\ud83d\udcaf I stopped being friends with someone due to him not being Able to drive and catering around him. Yeah sorry not worth it", "Yeah, I can\u2019t drive due to PTSD. Hopefully, one day, I\u2019ll be able to overcome the trigger, but for now it is what it is. If transporting me is too inconvenient to someone else, and I don\u2019t have other options or don\u2019t want to drop $50 on an Uber, then I don\u2019t ask and I don\u2019t go. \n\nIt\u2019s isolating, yeah. I don\u2019t get to participate in the vast majority of social life. Cars are forcibly necessary where I live, so I\u2019m massively screwed over and my every aspect of my life is ridiculously narrowed. Friends who will drive an hour or two to see our other friends won\u2019t drive 15 minutes to see me because I can\u2019t reciprocate. It sucks. It\u2019s not fair and frankly not my fault. \n\nBut I refuse to burden others where I don\u2019t have to. Every request feels painful, no matter how small. I can\u2019t imagine demanding someone cut their rare visit with anyone short for me. If I\u2019m going out with someone, I don\u2019t get any say in how long we stay out.", "For real. My bf when I first met him told me he didn\u2019t drive because of anxiety. I said fine, that\u2019s his choice, but I will not have a partner that I have to cater to because they choose not to drive. \n\nHe got his license within 6 months of us dating and now drives everywhere.", "Im not sure it matters.  \n\nThis boils down to OP can't leave the house for more then a few hours, can not drive and can not take an Uber.   Its not unreasonable for her husband to say, \"I can not always accommodate that. Sometimes I want to socialize outside of our house for more then 3 consecutive hours\"", "I probably wouldn't have mentioned it initially but that's my autist brain not thinking about what context is needed, i regularly miss out info that turns out to be relevant when talking online and in real life especially when emotional. In the edit op says her husband knows and I'm just taking it at face value.", "Yeah bit he shouldn't have told them they could before discussing it imo", "I'm not OP... i take transport just fine and will be learning to either drive or maybe cycle since it's less expensive... also not sure why you're being a dick either over such an innocuous comment with some humour too. Chill out.. and learn to read usernames.", ">Has he observed this being exclusively the dogs' room?\n\nHow could he not? These are blind dogs and very likely spend most of their downtime in the room they are most comfortable in and familiar with.  They probably have beds, toys, maybe even food and water in there.  It is not believable that it didn't occur to him that this room had regularly been in use for a singular purpose and that he should, I dunno, BRING IT UP before telling people they could stay in there for multiple days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Surely you can see how he might be ticked to find out that you'd decided unilaterally that no one can stay in that room, right?\n\nI mean, not really. Not at all. There is no room in my home I'd expect either myself or my partner to agree with someone else staying. We also have two bedrooms, a relatively small floorplan, and don't really ever have overnight guests. If we wanted to have people stay over, it would take planning, cleaning, and possibly the acquisition of new furniture to accommodate. I.e., I'd rather pay the hotel bill than deal with that.\n\nAnyway - this all largely beside the point.  OP did nothing wrong by not agreeing to having them stay over. Anyone is allowed to veto overnight guests in their home for any reason, and OP's reason is more than valid.\n\nSo, with that established, the outcome was as expected: they stayed at a hotel in the city. It's half an hour from OP's house, and they have a car. This is not a complicated puzzle to work out. Neither of them tried because they were both pissy at each other.\n\nIf the husband has issues with the dogs or how that room is being used, I would encourage him to bring it up with OP. This is a baseline expectation in any relationship, and not an AITA matter.", "Got it, thanks for the explanation.", "I once stayed in my friend\u2019s second bedroom that was also her cat room. We worked cat rescue together so this was fine, or would have been fine if she\u2019d actually cleaned up thoroughly.\n\nBut, that would have entailed a whole deep clean of the room. It was gross to sleep in but she put me up when I was in a jam so who am I to complain?", "That's not a compromise. He should have asked in the first place, and she was always allowed to say no to that.\n\nI would have them try to come up with a solution that allows her to come out with them while avoiding her having to take an Uber home. It wouldn't have been difficult.", "If I\u2019m going to go visit somebody, I haven\u2019t seen in years then yeah I might spend a couple hours at their house but I\u2019m also gonna want to explore the city that they\u2019re from, go to their favourite restaurant see the sites. So no I wouldn\u2019t want to make guests just stay in the house the entire time. That\u2019s not a good compromise either.", "Ehh, I dunno if that's something we should be criticizing the husband for. Husband's cousin took a hotel downtown instead of, say, a nearby motel or an out-of-the-way airBnB or whatever, which probably cost him a pretty penny considering the cost of overnight stays with any of these options nowadays... is it not reasonable for husband to think \"if I invited my cousin on this trip and now he's staying in a hotel like its a vacation to see the sights and not just a social visit, I really owe it to him to turn this into a vacation to see the sights and make the most out of the trip for him\"? And is it not possible that the cousin may have had a say in this decision-- OP is probably not privy to the conversations between her husband and his cousin, it's very possible that the cousin said he'd come even if he has to take a hotel, but if he's taking a hotel he wants to make the most of it as a vacation instead of as a family visit, and would be spending most of the time doing tourist things with or without OP?", "Yeah, I really don't understand the people who are acting like there was no other option to make this work.\n\nMaybe it's because I also don't drive and generally avoid public transportation as much as possible (I have no excuse - I just hate taking the bus, don't like paying for an Uber, and generally would prefer to stay home than go out anyway) while having family who live 30-50 minutes away so I've had to get creative to get myself to places, but I see so many solutions to this. \n\nAnd if it were my spouse, I'd try to find a solution, because I actually love them and want to work with them to find solutions to little things that come up in day to day life. Like do all these people hate their SOs or what?", "Yup, it is really clear...\nThat OP wanted to have her cake (blind dogs geting a room for themselves... cause they won't feel good seeing another room all day for 2 days), and eat it too, spending the day downtown and forcing the hubby to drive her every couple hours home to care for the dogs, and go back!!", "But not really. They\u2019re coming, staying at a hotel and it makes sense for them to want to explore the city. Who is to say they wouldn\u2019t have wanted to go see the sights if they stayed with OP? \n\nI think it totally makes sense that OP\u2019s husband would spend a long day with them out in the city. 12 hours is 8 am to 8 pm, which is not insane for seeing people you don\u2019t see often. I can also see where they wouldn\u2019t want to just hang out at OP\u2019s house if the hotel was in the downtown area and was their \u201chome base\u201d for the visit. \n\nIt\u2019s really not fair for OP to exclude herself and blame her husband.", "From the post it sounds like he discussed it with his cousin, and then later TOLD op that his cousin was coming to stay with them, and she said they can't bc dogs room etc. In a marriage, or honestly any living situation, you can't just unilaterally make decisions about guests (barring emergencies obviously). You've got to talk to the other party bc no one exists in a vacuum.", "Agreed.", "Ah, I hadn't seen the edit until you mentioned it just now. \n\nI'm torn, then. Because, yeah, I'd be frustrated if my husband suggested something I can't do. But now it perfectly explains why he *first* suggested that she stay home: because the alternative, as he pointed out, is to take an Uber and he knew she can't do that.", "Sure but he fixed that.\n\nEdit it sounds like husband is sick of fostering special needs dogs and the total commitment that takes.  It's sounds like he is sick of 1/4 ( guesstimate) being devoted to dogs.  \n\nFostering and adopting dogs that can't be home alone for more than 3 hours is a passion they need to share. \n\nI'm not going to assume but there is some hint that this might not be the first time Op and spouse had a conflict over the dogs/ op not being able to leave the house/ him having to leave things early to drive op.", "> How could he not?\n\nOP says they never have guests, so it clearly never came up. He saw that the room happened to be used by dogs, but clearly they never had a conversation about whether or not anyone would ever be able to stay in the room. \n\n>They probably have beds, toys, maybe even food and water in there\n\nSo that means he for sure knows that no one can sleep in there? Because there's a water bowl or a dog bed? \n\n>It is not believable that it didn't occur to him that this room had regularly been in use for a singular purpose\n\nIt had been used for a single purpose, but that doesn't mean he knew it was off the table for being used for additional purposes. \n\n>We also have two bedrooms\n\nSo, you get to decide how the other bedroom is used without any kind of agreement with your partner? \n\n>Anyone is allowed to veto overnight guests in their home for any reason\n\nDid husband agree to live with those high needs dogs, did he know when he agreed that he was agreeing to never be able to have houseguests stay over? OP clearly doesn't consider them \"their\" dogs, she refers to them exclusively as \"hers.\" How much input did husband have in giving up this room? \n\n>This is not a complicated puzzle to work out\n\nI don't think husband thought it was complicated either. He seems to have worked it out just fine. She just didn't like what he worked out because he didn't do what she wanted him to. \n\nThem not staying at the house isn't the problem with OP's actions, IMO the problem is her thinking that her husband's solution wasn't good enough because he didn't give up enough of his time with his family to drive her around, especially because she wanted him to give up time with his family so she could take care of the dogs, which were the reason he had to drive to the city anyway!!! \n\nShe can veto them staying in their house, but she then loses the right to be mad at her husband for leaving the house to go see them.", "Your arrangement with your partner and his with the OP are not equitable, because he obviously was under the impression that the room WAS available for guest. When he brought it up with his wife, she said no, and he told his cousin that it wasn\u2019t available anymore.\n\nAlso, are you saying if your partner wanted family over, you would not be willing to let them use the office as a bedroom? What if their family doesn\u2019t have money for a hotel? What if your partner really wanted them to stay? Are you really not willing to compromise? My guest bedroom is also my office, but I have an inflatable mattress for guests when the need arises.", "If it's not difficult then what do you suggest?", "What compromise would've been acceptable to OP? Him not seeing his cousin at all? Seeing as OP already shunned having the cousin displace the dogs, and her husband wanted to spend as much time with his cousin as possible, what else could he have done? The dogs need to be tended to every two hours per OP. Should the husband drive back home every two hours so the dogs can be taken care of because OP won't take an Uber? I'm sure the cousin will be even less impressed by this controlling attitude. Sorry OP, YTA!", "You're right it's not a compromise, she got to unilaterally decide the cousins weren't staying at their mutually owned home. Rather, only *he* compromised by agreeing to respect her wishes even though he wanted to invite them.\n\nEven after her initial refusal to compromise on the cousins staying, the husband *still*  tried to compromise by saying she could join them (even though he clearly didn't want her there and neither did his cousins) if she took an uber or got dogsitters. She *again refused to compromise* and tried to force her husband to be her personal chauffeur when he was trying to see his cousin he hadn't seen in years. \n\nYour perspective on this is twisted.", "Yup, that is not a compromise with her but SUBMITTING TO HER WISH!!", "What\u2019s the solution then? Share with the class.", "If this is true it reads like Ops husband is done.   \n\nAsshole is a low bar so I'm not going to him an asshole for one day in what sounds like years he didn't have to stop an outing no more than 3 hours in to take OP  home. \n\n Note according to the comments Op accident was years ago, op been fostering special needs dogs for at least a decade( and keeping the unadoptable ones) op is shocked husband did not accommodate her.  So I'm concluding he normally does/ they normally don't go out much.  \n\nIt's possible this is the first time this came up.  And it's a \"you had ten years of the dogs being a priority I wanted 3 days. I always thought that when I really wanted something the answer but yes because when you need and want things the answer is always yes\" or  this has been coming up over and over.", "So it was discussed. At the end she said no because of the dogs needing to have familiar space. Which he accepted.  \n\n\nThe issue is still 100 % her.   \nShe wants to hang out with the cousin as well, Husband says thats fine.   \nHe just wanted her to know that he wants to spend more time with cousin and knows she will bail early to be with the dogs. So he explains that she will need to uber/find her own way home since he will be occupied at that moment.   \n\n\nShe throws fit and complains to reddit.   \n\n\n100 % She is the asshole", "I don't know that this is the place for Op. \n\n\nBased on everything op said.  even the traumatic accident ( which I totally get I had a relative who was an accident 17 and didn't drive their entire life in the US) I think OP husband just sounds done.   And I'm not sure I'd think he was an asshole.   I'd really think he wasn't an asshole if he told op to stop taking on more special needs dogs.  I love fucking dogs, they're awesome but Id not want my life to have to revolve around dogs to the point I couldn't go out for more than 3 hours and I'm a homebody. I wouldn't give my guest room to the dogs to the point people couldn't use it.   I don't even have a dog atm but I have at least 2 people who would dogsit when I get another one. \n\n\nThe Life OP is talking about You have to be all in for, it's like having kids.", "It's not that she can't it's that she chooses not to.

Idk it's conflicting but that makes me just think esh", "Yeah I still think it's shitty. He 'apologised for her' when she did nothing wrong. He got their hopes up it was his mistake.", "The most obvious solution to me is: all go downtown, then all go to lunch or dinner at a restaurant at a halfway point between the two locations. The husband drops off OP at home and continues on with the day out with cousins, or they stay at their home for drinks/dinner/games and the cousins Uber back to their hotel.", "In non-emergency situations, a spouse can always veto an overnight guest. He shouldn\u2019t have put her in a position where she had to put her down in the first place - he should have asked first.\n\nHe knew she wouldn\u2019t take an Uber, that\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t a compromise. He wasn\u2019t offering a viable solution and he knew it.", "I'm especially confused why OP couldn't ask someone to dog-sit, yes! She describes having a network of rehoming folks; are none of them local and willing to sit for a few hours? It's not even brought up as a possibility.", "But the guests were staying downtown and wanted to see the sights. They didn't want to drive out to the house (we don't know how far it is from downtown but it doesn't sound close) and then drive back to the hotel in a strange city in the dark. And it's winter; it gets dark early right now. \n\nTheir plans seem perfectly reasonable to me.", "So the alternative to that is they go the the house and sit around and watch OP take care of her disabled dogs for the better part of the day?? If I go out of my way to leave my home ro visit you (with your invitation) I expect to be entertained... I don't think that's unreasonable.", "Yes I agree a spouse can always veto, that's why he compromised and respected her wishes. Even if it wasn't because she was uncomfortable with the cousins, she was uncomfortable with her dogs being *potentially* uncomfortable for a couple nights. She valued her dogs' two nights of comfort over her husband's lifelong family relationship, but she gets to veto and he compromised.\n\nHe knew she couldn't take an uber so what? So the only compromise he could make was driving her back every 2 hours to check on the dogs? To ruin his time with his cousin who likely has unfavorable feelings towards her due to her selfishness? That sounds like compromise to you?\n\nAgain, he made every effort to compromise, even just by inviting her when noone else wanted her there. She said no. Your perspective is twisted.", "Fair point", "Wouldn\u2019t they be driving back and forth from downtown to see the sights if they were\u2026 staying at OP\u2019s house?", "I mean if they haven't seen each other in ages I'd have thought a coffee and catch up, maybe a nice lunch would have been a good idea", "Not every two hours. Once. They go out to the city for a while, grab a meal at a halfway point, drop OP off at home. \n\nEasy. \n\nThat would not ruin anyone\u2019s time who wasn\u2019t looking for an excuse to be miserable.", "No, presumably if they were staying at OPs house then they would've just hung out all day. But since they *already* had to stay downtown where the hotels were, they decided to make a cool day of it and see the downtown sights. And the husband joined. \n\nI really don't see anything suspicious or manipulative about this, I'm sorry!", "Fair point, but I would feel uncomfortable \"catching up\" with someone in their home who didn't want me to stay in there after being invited because they didn't want to \"inconvenience their dogs\". I would feel like an afterthought."]}
