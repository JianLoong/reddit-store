Sometimes I end up keeping them if a permanent home isn't found.  Right now, I have 2 blind dogs that I have adopted after fostering, and one 3-legged dog that I am fostering.\n\nMy husband (40M) and I (39F) live in a small house since it's just the 2 of us and the dogs. We don't need a lot of space but we do have a nice yard for the dogs to play in.  We only have 2 bedrooms and one of them is pretty much the dogs' room.  I've found that my blind dogs feel much more comfortable when they have their own familiar space so I pretty much made that room all theirs.  We don't really have guests so it's never been an issue before.\n\nA couple months ago, my husband's cousin got in touch with my husband after years of not seeing each other.  They were really close growing up and the cousin wanted to reconnect.  My husband ended up inviting the cousin and his wife to come visit us.  When my husband brought this up to me, I told him I don't mind visitors, but I don't feel comfortable moving the dogs out of their room and rearranging things in there so his guests can take the room, it would be too stressful for the dogs.\n\nHe tried to convince me that it would only be for a couple nights and the dogs will adjust, but I insisted that the dogs' room stay as it is.  He told his cousin about this and his cousin ended up getting a hotel instead.  My husband was not happy about this.\n\nThey visited this past weekend and instead of coming over to our house to visit, my husband told his cousin that he would just meet them in the downtown area they were staying in so they could explore the city.  My husband told me that since they were planning on spending the entire day out on the town, that I should stay home and watch the dogs since they can't be alone for that long.\n\nI told him that I want to go out on the town too, but he told me that I would have to Uber home because he's not going to want to come home.  I don't drive so we couldn't take two cars.  This made me feel extremely left out and I told my husband so.\n\nHe told me that since I am prioritizing the dogs over his cousin, he is going to make sure that he still gets to spend as much time as possible with his cousin since they aren't staying with us.  He reiterated that I can join, but that I'm going to need to take an Uber home to take care of the dogs.\n\nI ended up just staying home because I didn't want to take an Uber by myself.  My husband ended up spending a full 12 hours out with his cousin while I sat at home.  When he got back I told him how upset I was that he left me out of all the fun they had.  He said this was the situation I created by not even trying to let his cousin stay with us.\n\nHe said that his cousin told him they felt a little put out by having to get a hotel after they were invited to stay with us, especially given the reason.  He said he had to apologize on my behalf so it was probably better I stayed home anyway.\n\nEDIT: The reason I didn't want to take an Uber is because I was in a bad accident years ago and I have severe anxiety related to driving and being in a car with people I'm not familiar with.  My husband knows this and I feel like his suggestion to take an Uber was an option he gave knowing that I wouldn't be able to do it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2:  The amount of vitriol on this post related to my trauma is disgusting and disturbing.  I hope that no one else ever has to experience what I did that led to my trauma and anxiety.  And to see it be used as a punchline and dismissed so easily is really disheartening.  To all of you who feel the need to chastise me for having trauma, bless your heart.", "created_utc": 1673983513, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ekwlc/aita_for_not_giving_my_husbands_guests_the_spare/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The consequences of your choices. You made your priorities clear, and are now somehow upset that they were accommodated? \n\nYTA. I would have said N A H, but you are now blaming your husband for a situation you created.", "You're not necessarily the asshole for not allowing his cousin (and wife) to use the guest room. It wouldn't be the choice *I'd* make, but I'd think they'd probably *prefer* not to stay in a room that had \"gone to the dogs.\"\n\nBut YTA for getting upset that \"he left you out of all the fun they had.\" \n\n1. It was *your* decision that led the cousins to stay in the downtown area. \n2. You weren't \"left out.\" Your husband only said he was going to spend the entire day downtown with his cousin. He didn't want to leave early, so if you joined them and needed to go home to take care of the dogs at any point, you'd need to take an Uber. \n3. You stayed home because \"you didn't want to take an Uber by yourself.\"\n\nSo, you made your bed, and now are angry that you had to lie on it.", "YTA You weren't excluded from the outing with your husband and his cousin. You chose not to go because your husband told you he wasn't going to cut his day out with his cousin short to drive you home to tend to the dogs. You decided you didn't want to take an Uber alone and opted to stay home.", "NAH / YTA. \n\nI'm having a really hard time understanding the problem here. \n\n- You don't drive.\n- Your pets cannot be left alone more than a couple hours. \n- Your husband offered to include you as much as possible.\n- You declined because you wanted to be part of ALL the fun or NONE of it. \n\nThis is a situation of your own making? If you wanted to go out on the town for all the fun, you needed to get a dog sitter? Your husband is not obliged to only leave the house in 2-hour chunks for the rest of his life? What did you expect him to do, only see his cousin for 2 hours and then leave?", "YTA - you wouldn\u2019t let his cousin stay with you, you don\u2019t drive and rely on your husband to drive you, you won\u2019t take an Uber, and you insist on going back to take care of the dogs. So the options were for your husband to be forced to take you back to take care of the dogs, or you stay home. He\u2019s right, you put yourself in this situation and you were completely unreasonable. You didn\u2019t have to let them stay with you, but trying to force your husband to leave to transport you is too far.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how so many people on this sub say \u201cI don\u2019t drive\u201d, and it\u2019s not a financial thing it\u2019s just a \u201cI choose not to, and force everyone to cater to my transportation needs.\u201d You made that bed by not driving, so you get to lie in it by using public transport or not doing things. Choosing not to drive and forcing others to drive you around is the most asshole move I see here", "YTA. What exactly were you thinking would happen? Your husband would be ok with driving you home to check on the dogs then driving back? His cousin was only there for a couple of days. Also what is your problem taking an Uber alone? You created this situation and I know it\u2019s important to take care of the dogs but this is the consequence of not compromising.", "YTA because of the way you treated your husband after making this decision. By not allowing them to stay in the spare room, your husband maximized his time with his cousin outside of the house. That meant he would be out of the house for the whole day. Because of your choice not to drive or take an Uber, you decided not to go because again you prioritized the dogs. You could have planned getting a dog sitter. Or taken the Uber. Or you could have just owned your decision to prioritize your dogs over your husbands cousins visit. You being upset that he \u201cleft [you] out of all the fun they had\u201d was fully and solely a result of your own decisions.", "YTA. He told you you were prioritizing the dogs over his cousin\u2026. You absolutely were. You\u2019re an adult, if you wanted to be involved you could have taken the Uber, or gotten a ride from a friend, or taken the bus, or anything!!", "YTA.\n\nYou clearly don't think of your husband as your partner, or that he has any equal say in your household. Then you get upset because he does things outside of your house?  That's on you.", "YTA. People are focused a lot on the driving but I haven't seen this mentioned: you have multiple dogs and are active in the foster/adoption community. You really don't know anyone who could have dog-sat for a few hours so you could join them without having to worry about Ubers or someone driving you back and forth?", "YTA you didn\u2019t work with him at all to host his guest why should he work with you to have fun? You created this situation", "YTA he met your request and then you refused to compromise because you're not grown up enough to Uber alone?  And then you guilt trip over it?  That's some toxic behavior", "YTA", "Wait, what? YOU made the choice, OP. You had to have a pretty good idea how this was going to go if the cousin wasn\u2019t a guest in your home. Did you expect them to come and hang at a house where weren\u2019t really welcome?\n\nYTA.", "I'm kind of coming down on a soft YTA here, because you're kind of expecting everyone to accommodate your choices. \n\nYou decided to unilaterally block one room in your shared house for your dogs. \n\nYou don't drive, you don't want to uber. Is public transportation an option?\n\nYou didn't arrange for someone else, like a neighbour, to come in and take care of the dogs. \n\nNone of this makes you an asshole. But then you expected your husband to drive you into town, have a shorter visit with his cousin than he wanted and drive you back when you had to leave. And that's really a lot to ask.", "YTA- I\u2019m definitely an animal lover but I can\u2019t see not moving dogs to a different room and allowing company to use it. I\u2019m 100% sure the dogs WILL BE FINE.  You sound annoyingly helpless and dependent. There\u2019s just no pleasing you unless you\u2019re being entirely disruptive.", "YTA.\n\nNot for letting the cousins in your home. But for making a big deal of not going out when you could've just gone home separately. He's maybe a slight a holee for the comment about the dogs needing to have someone home, but he's right about the offered solution. Youre an adult. Take an Uber. \n\nWhy don't you want to take an Uber by yourself?", "YTA because of the Uber. Dogs are creatures of habit and special needs dogs that have been shuffled around can be moreso. They should keep their room. You put the dogs\u2019 comfort before the cousin. I think that was the right thing to do. That said, you should have joined them for as much of the day as you could. If I were the cousin I would be understanding about the dogs but not with you not coming because you didn\u2019t feel like taking an Uber.", "Mild YTA. You care about the dogs more than the guest, it stands to reason that you wouldn't be prioritised by the guests - it's perfectly OK to say that a 'guest room' is a dog's room but don't expect the guest to feel welcome!\n\nAlso there seem to be  a lot of restrictions on your movement. Why can't you take an Uber home? You're the one that insists the dogs needs are paramount, what's wrong with going home to tend to them? It seems ridiculous to ban your cousin from your house AND ban your husband from seeing him any longer than you can AND not to be willing to take an Uber to join them.\n\nMaybe not really an AH per se, you essentially just don't have a guest bedroom I guess, but I don't know what else you expected from people. Not an AH for not giving them a room really, but definitely for then feeling entitled that everyone would make accommodations for you.", "YTA.  This was the consequence of your decision. You were inflexible and treat your husband as if he has no agency in his own home. \n\nHe did invite you, and it\u2019s a bit helpless of you to decline taking an Uber since you don\u2019t drive. So your choice to stay home. Yet you blame him for all of your choices, choices which would have taken him from seeing his cousin. Be mad at yourself. \n\nAt least he hasn\u2019t asked you to go sleep in your dogs\u2019 room.", "YTA- Learn to drive.", "YTA - you create a no-win situation, and then feel left out?", "YTA\n\nYou refused to house his cousin because it would disrupt the dogs. Fair enough.\n\nHusband & cousin hatch alternative plans. Those plans involve more time away from the house than the dogs can be left alone,  requiring you to either stay home or peel off early to fulfill the commitment *you* made to the dogs. (Or ask someone else in the rescue community to fill in for you)\n\nYou then refuse those options because you don't want to miss out on the fun but also can't/won't be responsible for your own transportation.  I get it that you have some significant anxiety surrounding cars but your anxiety doesn't mean everyone else's life must accommodate your wishes at every turn. \n\nYou foster and adopt special needs pets  and that limits your ability to be away from home for long periods. \n\nYou don't drive. \n\nYou won't Uber.\n\nYour husband wanted to spend some time reconnecting with a family member he hadn't seen in years and you're sulking?\n\nNo. Your not being a part of the outing is *entirely* the result of your decisions.", "YTA. Why didn't you just take the Uber? Wtf?", "YTA. He followed your wishes and left the room to the dogs. He did not purposely exclude you from the day. He never gets to see his cousin, you couldn\u2019t give him this one day? Not everything is about you and the dogs.", "YTA. Your husband made concessions for your comfort, now it\u2019s your turn. \n\nAsk a friend to drive you, drive separate, or take public transport.", "There is no winning with you, YTA", "You\u2019re not TA for not wanting to give them the dogs\u2019 room, especially since your husband offered without speaking with you first, but you are TA for the rest of it. I get that it sucks you were left out, but it\u2019s perfectly understandable that your husband wanted to spend as much time with his cousin as he could, and he\u2019s right that you put yourself in this situation.", "YTA - OP is perfectly free to make her disabled dogs the center of her world. The thing is most people are going to think you are one of those crazy pet people. Also the refusal to both drive and take an Uber sounds exhausting for the husband to deal with.", "YTA - I respect your love and care for your special needs dogs, however your husband is your partner and should have some say in the household as well.  It is not like he was asking to have the dogs removed in order to bring the guests in, he was just hoping for a little bit of accommodation.\n\nIf you can't accommodate your husband and his family members, why does he have to accommodate your need to be included?  Your anxiety issues with being in an Uber alone are also not his problem - he offered you a solution and you, as an adult, chose not to take it.", "YTA", "YTA I was in a bad accident where I\u2019m disabled and use a walker I still drive and take Ubers. You seem exhausting.", "You ain't the asshole. But he makes a fair point. It's a compromise you have to deal with. That's what relationships are about. Your partner values his relationship with his cousin that's important too him. You prioritize the dogs, which is fine. But then you have to deal with the consequences of said choice. You can't make him feel bad. He gave you options to join.", "YTA, you didn't want to compromise. This is entirely a problem because you made it a problem. You could've re-arranged the dogs in a way to accommodate his cousin, but you didn't, you dug in and wanted the cake, and eat it too. The dogs would've been fine displaced a couple days, and you weren't being a very accommodating host.", "I agree with your husband \u2026you wouldn\u2019t accommodate him or his cousin but then expected to be accommodated yourself for something you created .

You had other options YTA", "You made what (to you) was a logical choice and the consequences of that choice were to inconvenience the cousin, hurt their and your husband's feelings, and miss out on a fun day. \n\nYou made the dog's bed, you can lie in it \n\nDid it never occur to you to sleep in the dog's room and give your room to the guests? \n\nYTA", "INFO: how far away from your home are they going out?

I don\u2019t feel comfortable having people in my home I don\u2019t know anyway, let alone for days at a time.   \n\nThat saying, if it wasn\u2019t that far for an Uber to take you from where they were staying to where you live, you might be TA. I get having fears and anxieties about certain things, been on anxiety medication for about 17 years now. I dunno the extent of your anxiety, so I can\u2019t really judge based on that alone. But it seems like he tried to compromise here. At least on this part. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of crappy to say he had to apologize because he cousin felt put out that they had to stay at a hotel. Like, that wouldn\u2019t have even been an issue if he had just consulted you first.", "YTA", "Nta but you have to accept the results of your decisions.

They can wind up injured. If your husband knows this very basic fact about blind animal care, he should not have offered up the dogs' room in the first place.

If so, time to have a discussion about that. It seems like some kind of resentment about the animals is subtext in this dispute that's supposedly about the cousin.

Sounds like your husband was being difficult as \"payback\" for you refusing to move the dogs when he has to know about your trauma and why an uber isn't reasonable for you.\n\nMy old roommate had a blind dog and I know how much they rely on their surroundings being the same. Suddenly not being allowed somewhere or being moved to a new place could be very distressing and they could hurt themselves. Very reasonable not to give up the room, and it's your husband's fault for offering it without asking you.", "NTA Well, if it isn\u2019t the old tit for tat. Petty retaliation hasn\u2019t been proven to serve as a bedrock of a healthy relationship, so his behavior is disappointing.

In fact, currently, every morning that I get up I find our current \"bedroom dweller\" in that bedroom tucked away in her \"safe spot\".  Our house is unique that we can let her roam free while keeping the rest of the animals constrained to the other half of the home and she does come out and explore, especially at night, but she always retreats when she encounters any duress at all and it's always to that bedroom and to her spot.\n\nOnce we were forced to convert the room to a bedroom for a time out of necessity for my wife's very old grandmother and removing the safe place was not an easy conversion for the animal or for us.  In fact, it was very traumatizing for the animal however we were able to recover her from that.\n\nOn the other hand it seems like your husband is an AH for using this as some form of retaliation against you.  I hope this isn't a common occurrence for you.", "NTA but kinda YTA. NTA for making them stay in a hotel. Its not like you have healthy dogs. Its different. You have special needs dogs.

Sometimes I end up keeping them if a permanent home isn't found.  Right now, I have 2 blind dogs that I have adopted after fostering, and one 3-legged dog that I am fostering.  \n\nMy husband (40M) and I (39F) live in a small house since it's just the 2 of us and the dogs. We don't need a lot of space but we do have a nice yard for the dogs to play in.  We only have 2 bedrooms and one of them is pretty much the dogs' room.  I've found that my blind dogs feel much more comfortable when they have their own familiar space so I pretty much made that room all theirs.  We don't really have guests so it's never been an issue before.\n\nA couple months ago, my husband's cousin got in touch with my husband after years of not seeing each other.  They were really close growing up and the cousin wanted to reconnect.  My husband ended up inviting the cousin and his wife to come visit us.  When my husband brought this up to me, I told him I don't mind visitors, but I don't feel comfortable moving the dogs out of their room and rearranging things in there so his guests can take the room, it would be too stressful for the dogs.  \n\nHe tried to convince me that it would only be for a couple nights and the dogs will adjust, but I insisted that the dogs' room stay as it is.  He told his cousin about this and his cousin ended up getting a hotel instead.  My husband was not happy about this.  \n\nThey visited this past weekend and instead of coming over to our house to visit, my husband told his cousin that he would just meet them in the downtown area they were staying in so they could explore the city.  My husband told me that since they were planning on spending the entire day out on the town, that I should stay home and watch the dogs since they can't be alone for that long.  \n\nI told him that I want to go out on the town too, but he told me that I would have to Uber home because he's not going to want to come home.  I don't drive so we couldn't take two cars.  This made me feel extremely left out and I told my husband so.  \n\nHe told me that since I am prioritizing the dogs over his cousin, he is going to make sure that he still gets to spend as much time as possible with his cousin since they aren't staying with us.  He reiterated that I can join, but that I'm going to need to take an Uber home to take care of the dogs.\n\nI ended up just staying home because I didn't want to take an Uber by myself.  My husband ended up spending a full 12 hours out with his cousin while I sat at home.  When he got back I told him how upset I was that he left me out of all the fun they had.  He said this was the situation I created by not even trying to let his cousin stay with us.  \n\nHe said that his cousin told him they felt a little put out by having to get a hotel after they were invited to stay with us, especially given the reason.  He said he had to apologize on my behalf so it was probably better I stayed home anyway.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You vetoed his guests, fair enough you had good reason. But that means he needed to be outside the house to socialize with those guests. You asking him to interrupt that time yet further to drive you around is too much. If it was important to you to socialize with the cousins, you needed to figure out the logistics yourself instead of putting it all on your husband. Hindsight is 20/20, but off the top of my head you could have asked another trusted friend for a ride, gotten somebody else from your rescue/foster org to look in on the dogs, or researched (and paid for) a fun activity that would bring the whole group close to home at the right time for you to walk home for your dog chores. You did none of that and just kind of pouted? Not great.", "ESH. Not wanting to move the dogs is reasonable, and it's your husband's own fault his cousin felt put out since he invited them without discussing it with you. \n\nThat being said, your husband has given up the ability to have family stay over for the dogs. That's a big sacrifice, and it is unreasonable to expect him to *also* cut his visit with his cousin short for them. You are being selfish.", "Well well well. How the turntables have turntabled.

Then your mad at him for spending the day with his cousin, def your fault and a situation you caused yourself.", "YTA. You just didn\u2019t want them there.", "YTA.

No you stay home and watch your dogs.", "YTA You put yourself in this situation. Expecting everyone else to cater to your wants and needs is a bit ridiculous. You didn\u2019t want to give up the room, a little unreasonable personally but fine. Then you want your husband to chauffeur you back and forth from the city, limiting his time with family? I really don\u2019t understand what you wanted him to do.", "YTA You made the rules without being willing to compromise. You foster dogs. You made a room for just them.

Right?\n\nSo what is it you would have your husband do?  Cut his visit to 4 or 6 hours so that he can drive you home to care for the dogs?\n\nI think you did enough.

But you have a living room or other space if you want to make room for family (long lost cousin). You didn\u2019t offer it.\n\nThe dogs require maintenance and you don\u2019t drive. That\u2019s on you and not your spouse to figure it out. Spouse gave an option, but you turned it down. \n\nI don\u2019t know an ending that would have made you happy. You shut down options. And the world doesn\u2019t revolve around your needs and your dogs \ud83d\udc15 needs. \n\nIf you were out on the town would you have soaked up the fun or put a damper on it? It\u2019s best you stayed home.", "YTA\n\nI get it. Dogs are a major priority for people, and that\u2019s fine. However, I think having the dogs adjust for a couple days so your husband could spend time with his cousin would have been fine. I think he was wrong to offer your place without consulting you first, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough for an E S H ruling. \n\nYou had options, and chose not to use them. You chose to be petty as an \u201call or nothing\u201d type of deal, which isn\u2019t fair to anyone. You chose to make his cousin get a hotel. That\u2019s fine. You both (presumably) own the house and should get a say. However, you chose not to go because \u201cyou don\u2019t drive\u201d. Which I get, traumatic accidents can lead to that. However, Uber was an option. Getting a dog sitter was an option. Getting a friend/family member to watch them was an option. \n\nJust because you had a traumatic experience does not mean everyone needs to adjust their life to suit your needs. If you can\u2019t drive because of anxiety, what would happen if your husband got rushed to the ER while he was out? What if his car broke down and he needed help? If your fear of driving is that bad, then I\u2019d suggest counseling/therapy to help if you\u2019ve not explored that. Driving is a key part of life for many people, and by choosing not to drive you\u2019re limiting yourself greatly.\n\nEdit: I also want to add, this coming from a dude who\u2019s dog is his world and also has severe anxiety. It\u2019s nice when others can do something to assist with it, but I don\u2019t expect folks to plan their lives around it. It\u2019s my struggle, my battle. Not theirs. Asking them to always adjust to it wouldn\u2019t be fair to them.", "YTA. You had options, you made choices.  I think you\u2019re miffed that your attempts to manipulate your husband didn\u2019t work out.  I\u2019m glad he had a nice visit with his cousin.", "ESH. Your husband was definitely being petty/punishing you for refusing to let his cousin use the guest room by setting up an itinerary that he probably knew you would object to. But you're also to blame for making a fuss over the visit not being planned according to your personal demands and desires when it wasn't about you in the first place--it was about your husband reconnecting with his cousin.", "YTA.\nNot about the dog of course, it\u2019s you about your audacity. \n\nIt is your choice to let him go out without you. He literally said you can come, but he knows you aren\u2019t prioritizing his cousin. He understand that. \nAnd you have the audacity to tell him that you felt left out? When you yourself left yourself out?  \n\nWhattt", "Yta, I feel like taking in these animals have hurt you and your husband\u2019s relationship, also the thing about not driving isn\u2019t realistic.

Seems to me you\u2019re expecting an awful lot of your husband.  Yes, you have some anxieties and phobias.  Let\u2019s say it again, YOU have some anxieties and phobias. Good that you\u2019re working on that, but to expect your husband to limit *his* life because of your needs is pretty selfish.  You might be the costar, but you are not playing the leading role in *his* life.  From the sound of it, he is generally supportive of you and doesn\u2019t do this kind of thing often.  Don\u2019t you think he deserves at least one day to do whatever the fuck he wants?", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for the dog room thing, that\u2019s totally understandable.

I love animals. I have pets. I spent tons of time with them. I also leave them alone to go to parties or out with friends, and we hire people to board or pet-sit when we travel.\n\nSo I'd like to issue a universal YTA to people who get dogs/cats/birds/hamsters they can't be away from for more than a couple hours AND who then get mad that everyone else in the world won't also revolve their lives around the dog/cat/bird/hamster.", "NTA!

I will not judge you for those things, but the reality is that we all make choices. By choosing to have dogs that need a lot of care- which is admirable- it limits how long you can be away. By choosing to put the stress of the dogs over having overnight guests, it limits how much your husband can visit with his cousin. \n\nYou made a bunch of choices, including to decline your husband's request to have his cousin stay with you.
