I visited home a few weeks ago and found him in such a bad state. He finds it hard to even eat on his own and requires constant encouragement just to get in a few bites. \n\nSeeing him like that, I took him to a doctor and he gave him meds. His state still didn't improve and I was getting worried. I told our family that he needs more support and that it's not normal for his state not to improve even after taking meds. My sister then made such a huge fuss about why I called his state \"not normal\" in front of him and that I should be saying he's fine instead. Anyway, I took him to another doctor and the new meds at least helped him sleep.\n\nI detailed all this for context and the conflict was yesterday morning. My sister and I woke up early. She went out to get some orange juice and bread while I stayed home and made tea and coffee and the table. After we were done, we left everything as it is for when the others wake up. \n\nWhen my brother woke up, I came down to accompany him to eat and just when I was asking him whether he would like some juice or tea, my sister comes downstairs, asks me if I was finished eating, I tell her yes in a puzzled tone, and she takes the juice away and puts it in the fridge. \n\nWhen I confronted her about this later, she said she bought it with her own money and blew up at me for offering it to him when it wasn't mine. I told her I assumed it was for the whole family since she just left it there but she said she just forgot. But even if she did forget, it wasn't appropriate to snatch it like that in front of him. She was the one who pointed out how we should be tactful around him just a few days ago so I really didn't understand why she acted like that. \n\nShe then started to scream that he's fine, that he's just using me emotionally, that he would be fine when I left but instantly become poor disabled when I come back. I told her that while I don't know why she's this resentful of him, but she's currently being a jerk and she should knock it off. \n\nOur parents who were standing there watching the ruckus intervened at this moment and told me okay can you just be the bigger person and leave now until she calms down. My mom said she's obviously just feeling burdened because of our brother and how it's not easy...etc.\n\nNow I feel guilty and like a jerk myself and I'm not sure if I did the right thing.

Just so you know though it can take 4-8 weeks for the likes of antidepressants to kick in fully, often with symptoms worsening in that time. Not ideal but unfortunately that\u2019s how it works", "NAH.\n\nYour brother's depression is something that impacts the whole family. It sounds like it has for a while. Since you've not been at home, your sister and parents have been dealing with the brunt of it for a while, and are probably burned out.\n\nIs your sister overreacting? Maybe? Is she being a jerk? Probably, yes. But it's probably stemming from deeper emotional conflicts, some burnout, maybe some guilt. It sucks for everyone and will continue to suck for a while.\n\nBased on that, I don't think there any AHs here. Good luck.", "NAH. Depression is like that. The people who see it every day are fed up with it and have created their own defenses... and they're not all rational. Advocating for better care makes OP completely in the right.", "NAH. The thing with depression is that if affects all of us, not just the individual with depression. Your sister has been living with this and it's going to be stressful for her. And she could be making a valid point re his behaviour- I have no way of knowing and I don't think you do either. \n\nIn any case, I don't think she's an AH for taking her juice.", "NTA, you are looking out for your brother and to be honest he is taking the necessary steps to get better when you are around. Your sister on the other hand is definitely an A Hole. She is not tactful with the way she speaks in front of your brother and she comes across very aggressive. Your parents should speak with her as she is only adding to your brothers anxiety. You and your brother did nothing wrong.", "NTA.  Depression \\*suuuuuuuucks\\*, and it's absolutely awful for someone to accuse your brother of faking.  Orange juice doesn't even factor into it, she can take a hike.\n\nYou're a good person for trying to help him- sometimes it's rough and \\*really\\* unrewarding, but it can be just what they need.\n\nI gotta ask what kind of doctor you took him to.  A GP isn't usually going to hack it, he most likely needs to work with a psychiatrist to figure out his meds.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\n I\u2019ve suffered with several forms of severe mental illness throughout my life(BPD, OCD, possibly schizophrenia) and my bio family has treated it as if I\u2019m doing it to intentionally ruin their reputation and to cause them emotional strain. Needless to say, this makes it so much worse. \n\nThat kind of gentle and patient care among the people making him feel like a burden will be so, so appreciated. Thank you for being a kind person, and I hope your brother is able to make a breakthrough soon", "It took a *sibling* to recognize the depression and seek appropriate care. Why didn\u2019t your parents assist him in seeking help? \n\nNTA. But your stepsister is ridiculous and your parents appear to be neglectful.", "NTA. It's a tough situation, and she doesn't seem to get it. If it had been a year? Maybe he would be manipulating. But he's not even been on the meds long enough to really help yet, let alone therapy. When I started a super low dose of an antidepressant,I was a freaking mess for about 8 weeks during the loading phase. I both couldn't sleep well and was so so tired constantly. I had almost every side effect there was until things evened out. It really sucks. Your sis needs to be more understanding and kind, it's a hard road but he is taking the right steps with your help. Which is, yes, needed when you're in the depths sometimes. Thanks for being such a good sister to him. He's very lucky.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Treating depression is freaking exhausting. I spent about a decade trying different meds, treatments, therapy, etc before I decided it was easier to just live with the depression and the voices.
