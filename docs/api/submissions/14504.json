Susan was there for four days, I visited every day until the last which happened to be on April 1st. Her roommate and other friends also visited.\n\nOn the 1st her roommate called me crying, saying that Susan's conditioned suddenly worsened and she passed on. In hindsight I should have thought something was up but hearing that in the moment turned me into a sobbing wreck. About a half hour later Susan and her roommate came into my house and shouted \"April fools!\" Turns out she was allowed to leave the hospital and that was how she decided to tell me. I did not know it was possible to be so relieved and pissed at the same time. I called this joke horrible, screamed at her and told her she was NOT welcome in my house for the foreseeable future.\n\nApparently Susan thought Easter would be an exception. I was hosting this year with a few relatives and she came in(she still has a key) I made her give it back and once again told her to get the hell out of my house and while she persisted and was very stubborn about it she finally left crying. The rest of the gathering was understandably awkward.\n\nIt's not like I will never forgive her or that I'm going No contact or anything like that, but I am just too hurt and angry to speak or look at her right now to have any sort of discussion about what happened. She tries to call and text me every day but I ignored most of them. Our family is split between acknowledging that there are consequences for this while several others say I need to move on and just forgive her because she still hasn't fully recovered and needs my support. I get that but I think she is getting plenty of support from other people right now for me to be a necessity, and if she wanted my support she would not do something so damn cruel. She was always a bit of a jokester but never like this, it really does not sit right with me at all to just bygones be bygones right now but some relatives including my parents say I should. I hope I can get some unbiased opinions on this please apart from family.", "created_utc": 1681181218, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12i5ul6/aita_for_banning_my_daughter_from_easter_over_a/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Telling a parent their child is dead is going too far and she needs to acknowledge that", "NTA. This is not a prank. You were told your daughter was dead. You went to deal with the worst thing a parent can and this was supposed to be funny? A prank should not hurt someone or cause emotional distress.\n\nI have had someone in my life fake their death and I will never forgive them. I will never trust them. You don't prank with life and death. A prank is matching the thread of your shirt, using a sewing needle to get thread to stick out the edge of the shirt and asking someone to pull it but because the thread is actually on a spool it just keeps coming and coming. That's a prank. This is emotional abuse. \n\nThere's zero justification for this. It's one of those things where you should talk to a therapist for the recovery because this is a maximum level betrayal. If you let them in your life at all is a process that's complicated but you are so far from the asshole in this you may be the mouth.", "NTA. Never cool to fake the death of a child to their parent regardless of age and especially since the child had been in the hospital. That's not a prank. That's a cruel lapse in judgement from an adult child.", "NTA.  But you do need to put a time frame on this punishment/consequence.  Otherwise, it does seem like you're being unforgiving and that you're going no contact with her.", "NTA- what she was cruel and it seems like she hasn't apologized or tried to make amends. The fact she was extremely sick and hospitalized, yeah. They left you thinking she was dead for a half-hour. Even a minute or two would've been too long.", "NTA. If she can't understand how that affected you, some time away will help.", "NTA. She just took a year off your life and doesn't have enough empathy to realise cruelty isn't a prank. \n\nTalk it out with someone neutral, like a therapist, maybe do a session with both of you later... but don't feel bad because you can't put this down yet. You thought your baby died. Take the time you need to heal.", "Sweet Jesus! Definitely NTA! \n\nThat is an absolutely horrible thing to do to another person, I don't even think you can call that a prank. That's just awful. I'd be furious if one of my children ever put me through something like that, and pretended it was a joke. \n\nI'm just flaberghasted. How on earth could anyone think it was funny to put anyone through that kind of pain? Let alone doing it to someone you love?", "NTA. Her roommate would NEVER be welcome in my house again, and I\u2019d have serious long-term trust issues with my daughter if she faked her death even for a half hour. That\u2019s not a prank, that\u2019s mental cruelty. Your daughter needs to understand just how deeply this hurt you. You need time to process what happened. Your daughter just letting herself in with her key on Easter shows she either doesn\u2019t understand just how badly you were hurt, or she just doesn\u2019t care. Either way, I\u2019d take the time to think clearly about what you want to say to her and what you want her to understand. Once you\u2019ve said your piece, she needs to explain just exactly how it was funny to give her mother the shock of a lifetime, thinking her daughter had died. I\u2019d make sure her roommate\u2019s parents knew as well. This isn\u2019t a normal haha prank, and you\u2019re reacting like anyone would. This isn\u2019t a forgive and forget thing, this is a serious breach of trust.", "I'm biased.  I think pranks are stupid.  They're never funny, at  least the ones I see on TV and the internet are never funny, they're mean and sometimes dangerous. And this one is no exception.\n\nTelling a person someone is dead is cruel, and when you're telling a parent their child is dead, that's 1000 times worse.  I can't believe anyone would think that's a joke. Your daughter is 21, she's old enough to know that's not funny, and that actions have consequences. NTA.\n\nThat said, I think you should figure out an end point to this and communicate that to Susan, like \"I'll talk to you in a week. I'm just really upset right now, you really hurt me, and I need a little more time.\" Otherwise she'll think you're going NC.", "NTA and what a cruel joke! Hopefully she learns and grows from this.", "NTA\n\nHonestly I think your reaction is pretty mild, if someone I really cared about pulled this on me, the relationship would be terminated right then and there. What Susan did is so far out of line there is absolutely no justifying it, and she needs to understand that. \n\nActions have consequences, and your reaction is more than appropriate. Please take all the time you need, however long it takes, before you feel ready to speak to her. \n\nAlso while I think your daughter is a complete turd I do hope she makes a recovery from whatever is apparently ailing her, and that she learns and grows from this.", "NTA, I just imagined my mom's reaction to being told this and I just couldn't ever do that to her!  The dance for if my daughter did that to me when she's older. That's a sick joke!  But I do think that you need to make amends very soon. I hate that I'm a \"what if\" person, but literally anything could happen. What if she gets in an accident or something, and you still have this \"no communication\" thing going on?  It's why I always give my husband a kid and day I love you when he leaves, even if I imagine punching him in the face while doing it. No regrets", "NTA. I can\u2019t even imagine the hurt, devastation, pain, anguish, etc that you went through after getting a call that \u201cyour child was dead\u201d. That\u2019s not a good joke ever. It\u2019s understandable that you need some time to get past the so-called joke.", "NTA - I hope someday she'll understand how scarring that was and give you the genuine apology you deserve.", "NTA - people have LITERALLY committed suicide after hearing their loved one has died. Maybe not within 30 mins but it\u2019s still within the realm of possibility. You\u2019re within reason to not talk to her for however long you want - not just how long you need.", "Nta. That's not a prank it's a betrayal. How could you ever trust sometime who could think putting you in that much pain could be funny?", "NTA. A prank is a prank when everyone laughs. What your daughter did was simply cruelty. Even worse since they let you believe the worst thing that could happen to a mother had happened for a longer period. And half an hour is way too long. \n\nAs someone once wrote: \"Dear child of mine. I love you from the deepest bottom of my heart. But right now, I don't like you very much.\"", "NTA. It would have been bad enough if she had burst through the door seconds after the phone call, but 30 minutes later? Dear Lord! You are entitled to every ounce of anger. She needs to understand that this isn't something that can happen overnight.", "NTA. That\u2019s a horrible joke to play on anyone, especially a parent.", "NTA. She played the \"fuck around and find out\" game and doesn't like the consequences. She is an adult and old enough to know that joke is never ok. Especially after being hospitalized. She needs to respect your desire for space. \n\nI would suggest when you are ready have a sit down with her and explain how she made you feel.", "I won't lie. I'm a bit biased here but heck No. What a rotten joke.  She shouldn't be welcome for awhile.", "NTA / people who do those kind of jokes are the worst. pranks are supposed to be funny for everyone!!", "NTA. I don't even have a close relationship with my mum and I would never, ever do this. I think I break is fair to do some healing on your part. Daughter needs to realise just how serious this is.", "NTA you need space right now and she needs to respect that, period.", "NTA. You're right to be upset, but I think ignoring her calls is a little excessive. Either way, I don't think you're an asshole for it.", "NTA but young people do stupid shit because they're stupid. I would still have invited her for Easter. We don't have an infinite number of Easters to spend with our loved ones. \n\nThat being said, you didn't do anything wrong or overreact or anything like that. Anger is 100% justified.", "Oh man, NTA.\n\nI'm ashamed to say I was on the giving end of the \"joke\".\n\nI had a pretty shitty day at college, and was coming home, mom called to ask where I was so she could ask me to buy something on the way or whatever. \n\nAlready beaten by how shitty the day was, and decided to \"joke\" when asked where I was. So, I said \"In the mortuary\". Fucked up I know. Mom just dropped out of call and was not talking to me for a few days.\n\nI am sorry you have to go through this, like me your daughter has to understand that her actions hurt you and that you need space because what she (and I) did was cruel and you need time to process this.", "Talk to her. Tell her how you were affected by her \"joke\" without screaming", "ESH. I kind of feel like there's a chance she may have been a little more impulsive than usual after what sounds like a serious health scare. Is there any chance she had a concussion or spent some time heavily medicated or was at any time afraid she was going to die? Not that those things would excuse a cruel \"prank\" but it might explain this behavior. It really sucks to be a mother and have your kid treat you like you're not a real person with human feelings. That must have hurt horribly. \n\nThere's boundaries and then there's rejecting your child. You gotta be really careful with that. Being asked to hand over keys  to the family home and having your mother screen your calls is some serious shit. You really might find she's not interested in healing this rift when you decide you're done. If you want to preserve the relationship you might need to communicate about this soon.", "NTA - but certainly very gullible! If your daughter had in fact passed away, it would be the hospital contacting you, her mother, not her friends? I totally get how you\u2019d feel hearing the news regardless, and I\u2019d certainly need to take a time out from my child if they did that to me too! But don\u2019t be too hard on her, just tell her adamantly it was a really crappy thing she did to you and it\u2019s not fair to joke about dying with your mom because that\u2019s our bloody biggest fear!!", "ESH. First that joke was horrifying and beyond horrible and no wonder you are so upset. You are 100% right to be as upset as you are. BUT, if she had a medical emergency that serious, I'm afraid there is a chance she'll have another one. Just tell her how you feel and move on because you'll never forgive yourself if something happens to her while this is going on. (In other words even though your daughter is the real AH, YTA, too, but only potentially to your future self.)", "YTA.\n\nYour daughter most likely didn't think about how it would make you feel. Even if she did know, just not to the extent that you would cry that much, cutting her off from your life is a terrible thing to do. Besides, just recovering from the hospital only for your mom to not even love you anymore would make almost anyone extremely sad. Plus, whats the point of crying for her \"death\" only to basically have the same effect as though she had died?", "YTA - you\u2019re GROWN! and not speaking to your child for x amount of days for an extremely bad joke is extremely childish itself. Yeah op definitely went through the first stages of grief which is terrible, but shunning your child or giving them the silent treatment is childish imo especially at your age respectfully. talk to ur daughter n communicate with her, she didn\u2019t mean any harm.", "YTA it was just a prank bro.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
