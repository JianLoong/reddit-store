We didn't really have a falling out. There were reasons, but it come down to relatively small stuff, and we didn't feud or anything. \n\nAround Xmas she texted me that she had toys for my son. I told her she can swing by whenever, we're always home after work. She ghosted me. \n\nI reached out this week over text because I figured I would bury the hatchet. \n\nMain point: we had a back and forth about my son. She said she felt like he got ripped out of her life over the last few months and was sad about it. I told her explicitly and clearly that I am not keeping him from anyone in the world but my two parents. My door is always open to her, and even if we're not seeing eye to eye she can always come hang out with him or pick him up. I told her unless she gives me some kind of safety concern, I have no issue at all with her spending time with him. I told her truthfully that I will never tell my son what to think of anyone including her, so she never has to worry about me badmouthing her or anything like that. I told her my POV that I felt like he is being punished for an issue between two sisters and it isn't fair to him. She blew up at me over this. \n\nShe said it's ridiculous that I think that way. She said if she doesn't feel comfortable with me, there's no way she is taking my son out and having a relationship with him. She said I am putting the burden on her shoulders, and my son having relationships in life is my responsibility. She was truly offended at the idea that not seeing my son because of her issues with me is in my opinion a punishment to him. \n\nI pointed out that everytime she has seen him it's because I set it up or hounded her. It's not my job to harass her about it. She hasn't seen him since he was a year old because I stopped setting it up myself, and he walks and talks now and has a whole personality. She was offended that I said she wasn't there to see it. I told her that her relationship with my son is what she makes of it  and it's her responsibility to make time and see him. That's essentially where things left off in that regard, and we're still not talking.\n\nSo AITA here?

You could dish out some advice your own way and let your sister live her life how she and her moral compass allows her to.", "YTA. Your sister has zero obligation to have a relationship with your son. If she doesn\u2019t want to be involved, that is 100% her right.", "YTA. I read your comments and I can see why your comments to your sister about her relationship pissed her off. Instead of apologising for crossing that line, your attitude is 'whatever'. That's fine, but you can't then sit back and expect her to try to build a relationship with your child.", "YTA. It's your responsibility to provide for your son, including fostering relationship you'd like him to have with members of your generation. It is not your sister's responsibility to affirmatively reach out and form a relationship with a child that's not hers.", "YTA\n\n\\> She said if she doesn't feel comfortable with me, there's no way she is taking my son out and having a relationship with him.\n\nAbsolutely reasonable. I also think it would be confusing to your son since he is so very young. He should only be in the care of someone who the parent has a good relationship with (the exception being a custody situation).\n\n\\> She said I am putting the burden on her shoulders, and my son having relationships in life is my responsibility.\n\nCompletely correct, at that age. It's not her responsibility to be an aunt figure at all, even if you two DID have a good relationship.\n\n\\> She was truly offended at the idea that not seeing my son because of her issues with me is in my opinion a punishment to him.\n\nI also feel that that idea is quite offensive. It is YOUR responsibility to build good relationships to other adults who can be aunt/uncle figures to him! Blaming her for \"punishing him\" for not wanting a relationship with your son when you aren't on good terms feels manipulative on your side.\n\n\\> I pointed out that everytime she has seen him it's because I set it up or hounded her. It's not my job to harass her about it.\n\nCorrect. And it's not her job to maintain a relationship to a literal infant whose parent she has a very difficult relationship with. The whole concept seems very strange to me.\n\n\\> I think it's better for my son to have some connection than none to his aunt\n\nAbsolutely not! The only adults who should be in his life (at the moment) should be adults who YOU have a good connection to. When he's significantly older and more independent, that may be a different story (at the very least school age though).\n\n\\> but I think it's her responsibility to foster that relationship, not mine.\n\nAbsolutely not! You can't seriously expect someone to want to be an aunt/uncle figure to your infant who has a difficult or even bad relationship with you?\n\nSeen that you two come from a broken home, my assumption is that your sibling relationship got massively overburdened since both of your parents failed at being parents. So I'm assuming that's where your expectations towards your sibling come from - from the fact that you have expectations towards each other that go beyond the sibling relationship. You have expectations towards her that would be normal if she was the grandparent/your parent - not the aunt/your sibling. This may be a mutual parentification dynamic due to both of you coming from a broken home. I do empathise with you but it doesn't change that in terms of your expectations of responsibility toward her, you're TA.", "After reading your comments, YTA", "Well there is more missing to this story but...based on what it was CHANGED\n\nEdited based on clarification.  ESH.\n\nYou need to be involved if there is this much conflict.  You cannot just say, welp I'm mad at you but here's my kid for u to take somewhere. You should be facilitating the visit at least for the beginning.  She has no kids and is a college student.  Also stop weighing in on her life. Her relationship with boyfriends parents is hers to manage.\n\nShe wants to play fun auntie, she's gotta put some skin in the game.  She blew you off when she had gifts. Wow. Maybe I would say, I'm not keeping you from seeing my son, but you need to contact me for visits.  I can't chase you down.\n\nAnd bit of advice, have her talk to you re setting up visits. Don't have her set up with your kid when he is older.  I made that mistake and my SIL kept making plans and blowing off my kid.  It was devastating to her.", "This is a bit of an ESH but borders on N A H.\n\nIf she is having an issue with you, it's reasonable that she would not be the one setting up Auntie/Nephew time. Your child is not old enough to set up his own time with his Aunt and therefore your issues with her and vice versa *will* impact him. \n\n*However*, if she was truly this upset about the situation she could have approached it long before.\n\nOn a whole, you two are communicating poorly and from a place of hurt, but you **do** have to be a part of fostering that relationship as it's *your* child.", "Im not going to pass judgment here on either of you.\n\nYou have both been through pain and some kind of family trauma which has resulted in the two of you falling out or being in low communication.  If you have not already sought therapy for past hurts, i would urge you to do so.  \n\nIf you have no major beefs against your sister and your son beneits from having her in his life, it could benefit all of you to reach out and try to build a better relationship.  You have the chance here to repair past damage by taking initial steps to reach out.", "For everybody saying Y T A, please understand that when you have kids, shit changes. You can fight with someone in your family and still trust them to not hurt your child. Wanna know why? Because that issue is between adults. Y\u2019all are really gliding over the fact that this woman complained about not having a relationship with her nephew, then turned around and said she would never have one if she doesn\u2019t have one with her sister as well. She can\u2019t have it both ways. She\u2019s essentially blaming OP and accusing her of alienation, then when OP says \u201cwell you can still see him, you\u2019re always welcome to come get him or spend some time with him because our issues don\u2019t involve him.\u201d She flips out and starts saying that OP shouldn\u2019t think like that because obviously her hatred is going to affect her relationship with a toddler. Makes no sense. If OP\u2019s sister wants to see the kid, then she needs to be the one to reach out. She\u2019s just mad because OP won\u2019t do it all for her anymore.", "YTA.  She has zero obligation to have a relationship with her nephew.  That is her choice.", "ESH, imo you're both wrong. \n\nIt's not her responsibility. It's not your responsibility. It's both of yours.", "NTA\n\nIf your sister is unwilling to put effort in to see her nephew, then she doesn't want to see him regardless of what she says.

Or pick up (nephew) for lunch/dinner and give them to him then?\"  \n*crickets*  \n\nLeave it at that. If she wanted to, she would.", "NTA - I've been in a similar situation with two of my older siblings who have kids. We all experienced shit in our family and it took a toll on our relationships with eachother. I adore their kids especially since I've been around since their births (living with them at some points) and have no intention of having any of my own. One thing I've always done is show up for those kids, including driving 20+ miles to go see them, pick up the phone or call them when their bored/needed someone to talk to etc, even when I wasn't on good terms with my siblings. It is 100% the adults responsibility to foster good relationships with the kids in their lives.", "I mean I cut out my sister but I make the effort to see my niece. I don't really get what your sister wants from you.  Looking through some comments it does seem like you guys have a pretty messy relationship. Going nta on the kid situation though.", "NTA but i do believe it should be a mutual amount of effort to some degree.\n\nYou can't be expected to read her mind. It could also come across as you forcing her to do things with him if you were to call her and say \" Take kiddo for a sleepover\"", "The burden of her relationship is 100% on her. You've left the door open, she needs to put in the effort. I do the same with my ex's family. If they want a relationship with my kids they need to put in the effort. I'm not going to force anybody to be in my kids' lives, if they want to be here they have to show up.\n\nNTA", "NTA\nYou're right, if she wanted to be in his life, she would be. You're not just a mother and a sister, you're a whole ass person who has better things to do than arranging play dates for her adult sister.", "Slightly NTA.\n\nAt your son's age, his relationships are completely intertwined with yours. If your sister has a problem with you to the point where she doesn't want to see you (even if it's just short-term), or vice-versa, that is going to impact whether she sees your son.  In that way, this is kind of on both of you.\n\nThe only reason I'm going NTA over E-S-H is that it's more reasonable for her to come see your son than for you to bring your son to her - particularly if you're not really talking. If she wants that relationship and you're making it clear your door is open to her, then she needs to put in the effort to make it happen", "NTA but you both seem to have some deep rooted family issues that go far beyond her saying she wants to be an active \u2018Aunt\u2019 while feeling denied, but you feel you have to go the extra mile to make things happen.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think my expectations of what it would look like to have a child were way too high. I've sent my sis pics and videos of his firsts (like first steps, first tooth, first words), and she doesn't respond.

She has both", "It kind of sounds like babysit my kid but don't talk to me.", "I got cut off with the character limit, so I had to delete a lot of context. I will answer any relevant questions. \n\nWe were not talking over a couple of things. \n1. My sister lives rent free at her boyfriends family's house and they pay for her college expenses fully. I told her that I think she should have a little more gratitude, and she should view her bfs parents as basically parental figures. She was telling me her bfs mom is trying to control her, and telling her to work less and take more classes. I told her to stop railing against the lady and maybe take her advice. I told her she is a guest in that home and they are being very generous. I told her I think she should basically do whatever they ask within reason. She didn't like that and ghosted me. Whatever, it's my opinion. That's why she stopped talking to me. \n\n2. I asked her to buy my son diapers because I was low on money. She did but asked me for the money back in 2 days, when I told her when I could pay her back. I thought it was really weird and rude to take back the help so fast. I sold some of my son's toys, paid her back, and said absolutely nothing to her about it. It wasn't worth it to me to fight. I just stopped sending memes, and reaching out to chat. Just kind of fell off", "I can see that. I thought your kid was older. For the confusing part: imo there are different levels of involvement: just because she loves the kid does not mean she wants to be there for everything - it's a bit hard to see for new parents, no blame here.

Yeah, no. YTA. This adds so much context.", "YTA - so you are judgemental and expect her to give you money.", "\u201cI asked her for money and it is rude that she wanted it back.\u201d\n\nYour sister sounds smart and I understand why she is keeping her distance.", "Info: I told her that our money was tight and tied up for the next 2 months, and I would pay her back as soon as I could. I told her this over text, so there was no room for misinterpreting. I thought the rude part was asking for the money back almost immediately in this situation. If I knew that, I'd have just skipped right to selling my kids toys. I didn't fight with her about it, I just quietly in my head thought it was rude and wishy washy, and backed off contact accordingly. Maybe this makes me an AH. I still think my issues with my sister are ours alone. These are stupid personal conflicts, and my kid is not a literal extension of myself, he is himself. My door is open to her to see him, or take him herself. Rhetorical question: What does it matter what I think about her, or her living situation in relation to her being an Aunt? I might be an AH as a sister, but I'm asking if I'm an AH about her feeling like her nephew was \"ripped away\"", "What it matters about her \u201cbeing an aunt\u201d is that she does not have to \u201cbe an aunt\u201d at all. Yes, biological she is. However she has no obligation to have any particular role in your child\u2019s life. \n\nIf she can\u2019t maintain a civil relationship with you (because you seem overly involved in her life despite you not really having your own house in order, hitting her up for money, etc) it is extremely reasonable for her to conclude that a relationship with your child is also untenable and that she has to take a step back from it. Especially if she thinks you\u2019re using the baby for financial extortion. In fact, she\u2019d be kind of foolish to think otherwise. \n\nMaybe if they were significantly older, a totally independent relationship might make sense. But a baby/toddler? Not a chance. So yeah, makes sense that she feels that way."]}
