I\u2019ve met the kid and I\u2019ve known him since he was like 9 so I don\u2019t mind at all. \n\nI let them go into the room and shut the door I trust my daughter and her boyfriend, If I had a reason or I feel something g fishy going on then I\u2019ll address it but other than that you\u2019d be surprised how much just a little privacy helps a kid. \n\nAnyways my daughter and her boyfriend came as usual However the issue is my girlfriends issue with the door being closed. When he was over she constantly went into the room like she was trying to catch them in the act. She sat on their bed and clearly tried to conversar\u00e9 with them but you could tell it was just to be there with them. She would go in and purposely not shut the door in her way out. Or she would try and find some reason to usher then out of the room. \n\nI guess she also went to my daughter and told her that it\u2019s not okay to have doors closed in the house especially with a boy and to not to it again because she\u2019s a child and we should know what she\u2019s doing in there. \n\nApparently She\u2019s done this 4 times and my daughter finally came to me about it. \n\nI talked to her and said that\u201d I am fine with it, they aren\u2019t going to drop pants, their cuddling like normal teenagers and I don\u2019t appreciate you having that kind of discussion with my kid without my knowledge, and please be aware when she\u2019s stepping out of bounds\u201d \n\nShe said that when she\u2019s here it makes her uncomfortable and she should have just as much say as I do because one my daughter will never take her seriously two she feels uncomfortable with that and if she feels uncomfortable it should be changed and three no kid should be left with a guy unattended and to not be aware of what my kid is doing is neglectful and I\u2019ll pay the price when she\u2019s pregnant. \n\n I said 1. That her one reasoning seems like some sort of power play to show her authority which I or my daughter ever said was okay, 2. I\u2019m sorry she feels uncomfortable but that gives her no right to make my kids uncomfortable, and this is the boundaries I made with my child and 3. If I thought my kid would be irresponsible with the freedom I choose to give I wouldn\u2019t give it, and she\u2019s not given me or her any reason to believe she is irresponsible with herself or others, \n\nWe went back and forth with her saying that I was letting her make bad decisions and since I won\u2019t be a normal parent she will watch her as she sees fit. \n\nI said that if she chooses to continue to undermine my authority as her parent she needs to leave as she won\u2019t make my kid feel like she has no privacy, she won\u2019t undermine me as her parent. \n\nWell she left, I\u2019ve talked about this to a few people and while they agree she was wrong they say kicking her out was wrong of me.", "created_utc": 1668603612, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ywsp04/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_that_if_she_doesnt/", "score": 695, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your girlfriend has known your daughter for just about what, one year? And GF thinks it's ok that she should have authority over your daughter rather than form a bond with her? \ud83d\udea9\n\nIt's one thing if your daughter is actually making bad decisions and messing up her life. Even then, the way your GF is going about this is crossing so many boundaries. If your GF can't respect boundaries you've set with the trust you've put in your daughter,  this relationship isn't salvageable. You've been dating for 3 years and aren't engaged or anything. Cut your losses OP, I sorry.", "NTA - and let me just say this is soundd like some first class parenting! You're prioritizing your current (and future) relationship with your daughter and doing an amazing job respecting her autonomy. It's unfortunate that your partner is unable to do so (and also apparently to respect your decision making as a parent).\n\nI think this means you and your partner need to have a much longer conversation about what her role currently is with your daughter, and how it might change in the future. If your partner truly cares about her and wants to support her, she needs to swallow whatever feelings she has right now and accept that joining a family like this means making an investment that takes time, energy, and yes often discomfort too.", ">We went back and forth with her saying that I was letting her make bad decisions and since I won\u2019t be a normal parent she will watch her as she sees fit. \n\nNope. Not her right to do that. Not her home, not her child. I could vaguely understand it if she were living with you permanently, but she's not. \n\nIf she had issue she should have come to you first instead of assuming she had the right to act in loco parentis. Also - this kind of attitude results in kids being secretive and hiding things. THAT is when problems are more likely to arise.\n\n>I said that if she chooses to continue to undermine my authority as her parent she needs to leave as she won\u2019t make my kid feel like she has no privacy, she won\u2019t undermine me as her parent. \n\n>Well she left, I\u2019ve talked about this to a few people and while they agree she was wrong they say kicking her out was wrong of me.\n\nYou didn't kick her out. You gave her a choice. NTA", "NTA, I'm assuming you have ensured your daughter has had proper sex ed?", "NTA.\n\nBut, your daughter is 16. She seems to be in a good relationship with a nice boy who the both of you trust. Talk to her and her bf about safe sex and consent and let your daughter decide for herself what she does with her body.", "NTA\n\nThis will be a pivitol memory for your daughter, that you stood up for her right to privacy and emotional and bodily autonomy. Those are hunan right btw, and your daughter is a human being with those rights. \n\nYour GF is way out of line, not only trying to undermine you (beind your back too) but also overruling your decision and insisting on her feelings/opinion being superior to not only you but your daughter AND her boyfriend as well (pretty sure he wasn\u2019t having a great time either).", "NTA. Your daughter, your house, your rules. It seems she knew she was out of bounds. Otherwise she would've talked to you first before just trying to exert her authority. She's raising some red flags. Good for you on treating your with respect and like an adult.", "NTA - you did right by standing by your kid and your trust in her, those kinds of things are really important  \n\n\nFrom the way you framed it, it sounds like you did give her an option to stay, it just involved respecting yours and your Kids boundaries and she chose to not go with that and left", "NTA. She shouldn't be saying shit to your daughter at all. If she uncomfortable, she can leave.", "NTA.. She seems controlling... It would be different if it was her child imo", "NTA\n\nYou are the parent. Your gf might not like your style, but unless you're being abusive, she has no right to interfere.", "NTA she was being very controlling.", "NTA, but your gf sure is. Where does she come off telling you what the rules are for *your* daughter in *your* home?!? Like ... WTF!?!\n\nNo. This is your house and that is your child, and your gf needs to butt TF out.", "NTA. What your girlfriend is doing isn't okay, and when boundaries like that aren't respected, consequences happen. If your girlfriend won't respect you or your daughter, then she needs to leave. It makes no sense to keep her around knowing she's just going to keep doing that. \n\nIt's nice to see you're standing up for your daughter.", "NTA: you\u2019re the parent and it\u2019s your right to make decisions for your child without consulting your GIRLFRIEND. She isn\u2019t your daughters parent or step parent. Why does it make her uncomfortable? Was she super promiscuous as a teen and is now projecting her past behaviours onto your daughter? Super weird.\nlisten if ur daughter and her boyfriend are involved like that, they sure as hell aren\u2019t doing anything when either of you are home anyways. \nYou\u2019re setting the tone for open communication and trust with your daughter, that is amazing and so important. Don\u2019t let this woman dismantle what you\u2019ve accomplished. What a lucky girl to have a dad that is so trusting and open to letting her be a normal teenager. My dad was okay with cuddling at home with boys and I turned out just fine - no teen pregnancies, no boy crazy issues, nothing bad came out of the trust he gave me.", "NTA\n\nGood on you for standing by your daughter. Meeting her age 15, my guess is that your GF will never, ever, ever, ever, ever hold a position that is anything at all like anything parent-ish to your daughter. So GF needs to completely abandon that idea immediately, because she's about 10 years too late.", "NTA, keep protecting your daughter", "NTA\n\nHoly guacamole, she is only your girlfriend and she is already pole vaulting to wicked step mother territory. She is breaking all sorts of boundaries. Hell naw, trust your instincts and continue to stand your ground on this. You did the right thing, it sounds like this was becoming a bad atmosphere for your daughter if she continued to stay and act like this.", "Absolutely NTA. It\u2019s so refreshing seeing parents that  trust their kids. Your GF is completely out of line telling you what rules to have with your own well behaved teenaged child.", "NTA your gf is tryna parent a kid who isn't hers. She needs to respect your choices and your daughter's privacy and butt out!", "NTA. She was out of line. She is not your daughter's mother, and shouldn't impose her parenting choices, and that's exactly what she is doing.", "NTA\n\nYou stuck up for your daughter and defended her.", "NTA for you.  TA for GF.  The rules of behavior in you home are yours to make and live by.   There was no mention of birth control training, so that question is unresolved.   Here's hoping that it's done and daughter is protecting herself.   It's a good thing that you have confidence in her, but shit happens.", "NTA. Kudos for standing up for your kid. As important, this IS your home and your rules and agreements should take precedence.", "NTA your daughter, your house, your rules.", "NTAYou are absolutely right. It is power play. What if your daughter in return feels uncomfortable with you guys having your door closed? Will she keep it open? I bet not. She gives total evil stepmom vibes", "NTA. You are the parent. Her status as your girlfriend does not grant her any parenting role no matter what random reason she comes up with; and certainly not without discussing it with you first. She crossed a social boundary with her bad behaviors. Now that you have laid out what the parameters are, her only response should be 'yes', anything else is again crossing boundaries and assuming rights that she just doesn't have. That she is still arguing and fighting as if this is open for debate - says that she just doesn't get it and will never agree with it. I would also consider this a fatal character flaw for a relationship - she will only get worse if her role as your gf gets any more advanced. As a girlfriend, she doesn't have to approve of your parenting, but she DOES have to abide by your rules. End of discussion.", "NTA, and as a fellow parent and former English teacher, THANK YOU for standing up for your kid's privacy.", "NTA\n\nShe's your daughter, you are her parent not the GF.\n\nAlso your girlfriend chose to leave since she didn't want to concede the control she though she could have over your daughter.", "nta\n\nyou sound like a great dad who raised a good daughter. im glad you have your daughters back in this and put your foot down. your house, your rules.", "NTA. Your GF was wat out of line.", "NTA - she\u2019s your daughter and your decisions on what\u2019s acceptable are what matters. Not your girlfriends opinions. \n\nAlso seems weird so she\u2019s so set on trying to catch them in the act.", "NTA:  It's your kid.  You get to make the rules!  That's how it works.  \n\nHere's a handy flow chart:\n\nIs it your kid?\n\nYes?  Then YOU get to make the choices.\n\nIs it someone elses kid?  \n\nNo. You do not get to make the choices.\n\nSee? it's easy.\n\nYou're doing fine, Dad.", "NTA. To your daughter she's just the woman her dad happens to be currently dating, and even if you did marry this woman she would still have zero authority over her. I'm appalled that people who date parents think it gives them the right to act like a family member to their kids. She needs to take a huge step back and learn her place. She has a relationship with *you*, not your daughter.", "NTA. She doesn't have your permission to impose her authority on your daughter in this, period. YOU are the parent. Your girlfriend *could* back down & mind her own business, but if she'd prefer to leave, that's her decision.", "NTA but have a serious discussion with your children and see if they have any other issues with her trying to play \u201cauthoritative parent\u201d you\u2019ll find this is not the only time she has done it.", "NTA\n\nThat bit about how \u2018she will watch her as she sees fit\u2019\u2014this would be overstepping even if she was a stepparent. \n\nI\u2019m a divorced parent of young adults and if my spouse had ever insisted on usurping my role and overriding my teenager\u2019s boundaries like that\u2026he would not have continued to be my spouse. My relationship with my kids comes first, and that went double when they were younger and had less agency.", "NTA. She\u2019s your daughter. Also may I suggest if you stay with gf- condoms. Every time.", "NTA!! She sounds controlling and exhausting.", "NTA she wants to be taken serious as a parent by not taking your parenting serious. Your kid, your house, your rules. Her being uncomfortable with it is no excuse to make kids uncomfortable and lay down her rules. Her trust issues might stem from somewhere in the past, but she should deal with them, not the kids.", "NTA. She's your girlfriend not your daughter's stepmom and it does sound like she picked this as her power play. Your daughter is already 16 even if you guys do get married and she becomes the stepmom your daughter will be too old for her to start demanding a huge say in how she's raised.", "NTA. You are the parent. This is your daughter and it is your home. If your daughter being in her room with her BF makes your GF uncomfortable, then your GF needs to either accept this or needs to leave. She is not her daughter, and she has no authority to be telling her what she can be doing in her home or her room. \n\nAdditionally, your GF needs to be asking you before she takes *any* authority or decisions concerning your daughter. Just because she is dating you does not mean she has any parental position in your family. She is a *guest* in your home.", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't kick her out, you told her the rules about YOUR child, she outright refused to follow them, and therefore she chose to leave. \n\nFirst, you get to set the rules for your daughter, the end. You have not asked your girlfriend to coparent and this isn't an immediate discipline problem that warrants her getting involved. For example, if she is home with your daughter and she does something like open a beer or try to sneak out at midnight, your girlfriend should be able to intervene, just as a responsible adult. But, she can't override rules that you have in place. \n\nAnd I just want to add, that your rule is a great one. The likelihood of your daughter and her boyfriend doing something in her room, with you home, is unlikely. Of course they may push the limits, but you know they are safe in your home and that they aren't going to have a full on orgy or snort cocaine with you home.  But, if they feel they don't have any privacy, they will go somewhere else, where you can't keep any eye on them. Solid parenting!", "NTA\n\nYou stood up for your kid. You have clear rules at home and like you said, trusting your kid will in return enable her to trust you. What more could you ask for?\n\nYour girlfriend was way out of line and caused tension in the house with her unacceptable behavior. She didn't even care about your valid points. You had no other choice but telling her to leave if she can't abide to the rules of your own home.", "NTA at all, your girlfriend is being disrespectful and way over stepping, but don't assume they don't or won't have sex. It's better to have an open and honest relationship with your daughter so she knows that safe sex is important and she can come to you if she needs help with obtaining contraception if/when the time comes. Parents who act like what your girlfriend is doing (and she has zero entitlement to even do) is what cause teens to sneak around to do things and wind up pregnant.", "NTA\n\nYou've had the talk, your daughter trusts you and your trust her, that's the important thing. Don't let your GF put a wedge between you and your daughter.\n\nMy parents let me shut my door at 16 when I had bfs over.\n\nYeah we had sex, but I also knew what a condom was, my bfs didn't get any if they didn't wear one, and my mum had taught me what to do and where to get emergency morning after pills if I was worried one of them broke. (All legal in the UK)\n\nI never ended up pregnant.\n\nMy parents trust in me was priceless and encouraged me to talk to them about the tough stuff, and I never worried that they were going to judge me or treat me as if I'm stupid.\n\nThere is so much emphasis on kids beings an \"adult\" at 18, but it's not some magic switch that flips on your 18th birthday, to become an adult at 18 means getting trust, respect, privacy, anominity and non-judgemental advice and help, long before that special birthday rolls around.\n\nKeeping treating your daughter like a growing woman, OP, instead of coddling her like a child, she'll be a better adult at 18 for it.", "NTA.\n\nMy brothers girlfriend used to do this with me. I hated her. \n\nMy brother saw sense when she had no REASONABLE explanation for why she kept coming in. She was only 3 years older than me, but felt the need to parent me.\n\nMy brother knew how I felt about her. Albeit I only ended up screaming at her once (after 6 months of her BS). Brother decided she wasn't worth it. He was 19 at the time. When she finally left, brother and I realised why there was so much tension between us. We finally became friends again.\n\nKnow that your daughter is going to create a wedge with you if you don't stop her BS. And I mean actually stop it (either by fixing the issue or breaking up).", "NTA.\n\nGood job sticking up for your daughter here.  I'm not saying your gf is wrong about the fact that hormones could get the best of these teenagers and that it's totally impossible your kid might actually go all the way with the privacy she has, but you have your specific boundaries and rules for your kid and your gf is in no position to overrule or undermine them.\n\nIf you're wrong, you'll learn the hard way.", "NTA your home your kid your rules. but idk wtf you were doing as a teenager that would  make you think \u201cI trust my teenager and her boyfriend\u201d is a valid position hahaha", "NTA and well done for understanding your teenage daughters needs and putting her first!\n\nPrivacy for a 16 year old girl really does go a long way and honestly something as simple as being \u2018caught\u2019 cuddling your boyfriend at that age can feel humiliating. Your girlfriend is beyond out of order", "NTA. We're not talking about your wife or fiance or a partner you live with. This is a girlfriend who doesn't even live in the home. Of course she gets no say in how you parent your child. If she doesn't like the way that you're choosing to parent then it is her prerogative to leave. She doesn't get to walk into your home and demand you change the rules just because she is present.\n\nI will add, I do agree with your gf that allowing your 15yo daughter to be behind closed doors with this boy might not be the best decision. So genuinely consider if her concerns have merit. But obviously you know your child better than strangers on the internet.", "NTA, but I want to caution you about how much trust you're leaving in the hands of teenage children when it comes to sex.  You're still the adult parent.  They're still children. They won't always make the best decisions and it's your job to make sure they do. If something happens like a pregnancy, it'll be just as much your fault as it is theirs. Do you want to risk that?  Personally I wouldn't.", "You are absolutely NTA!!!! \n\nYou sound like a kick ass Dad who has a wonderful relationship with their teenage daughter. The balance of trust and respect between you and your daughter is admirable. It is also incredibly refreshing that you are setting reasonable and sensible boundaries with your gf in terms of how she treats your daughter rather than allowing her to undermine your relationship with your child. You probably don't see it as a big deal but it really is! \n\nI think you handled the situation perfectly. You needed to draw a hard line in the sand with your girlfriend and you totally nailed it. She is the one who needs to apologise and promise to change. If she isn't capable of it then she isn't the woman for you.", "NTA \n\nYou are the parent. Maybe your girlfriend should stop thinking about your daughter having sex? Let's be honest if it's making her uncomfortable she is thinking about it too much.", "Well I\u2019m not saying your daughter will do something like that.  I\u2019m def not saying your gf is wrong. I know way too many teen moms that had that luxury of a shut door. Myself included. \n\nShe\u2019s honestly just trying her best to prevent your daughter from becoming another one. I totally understand that. However you know the risks and you choose to continue giving her ample privacy. Which is fine. Your kid your choice. \n\nIf this is a make or break thing for you that\u2019s fine. Just make sure a closed door is worth your relationship with GF. Your daughter can still have some privacy in her room with the door open. It\u2019s not like you stand in the hallway lurking by her door. I feel like there\u2019s a common middle ground here if you care to find it.", "If you live together, and when you say you kicked her out, you mean you told her to move out, then YTA, because that's a huge overreaction. If your girlfriend was just visiting, and you asked her to leave for the day, then NTA, because she was overstepping your boundaries.\n\nAlso, don't be naive. Get your daughter on birth control, if she's not already.", "NTA I guess. But you are naive if you think they\u2019re not dropping their pants when the door is closed. My parents treated me just like you treat your daughter (super trusting) and I did all the dirty things you are claiming your daughter won\u2019t do (and is also definitely doing). Teens are horny and will have sex literally whenever they can. A closed door is perfect for it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

How can they KNOW their child has a girl-/boyfriend, allowing them privacy and not think one minute about the possible outcome?\nYes, with strict parents you'll end up meeting your boyfriend secretly in some shed combined with a lack of proper sex-ed and safe contraceptives sounds like a likely scenario for unwanted pregnancies. \n\nOP sounds like he not only trusts his daughter and her boyfriend, but also knows she's educated about sex and pregnancy and has no reason to worry about it.", "Yeah, well, you know, my parents were the opposite, very strict when I was a teenager and always scaring me that I'll get pregnant at the drop of a hat.

Hmm, I wonder what could it have been that made me so reluctant to pursue anything remotely sexual?", "Again, me and my kid have had every talk that we need to, she has shown me that I can trust her, I have no reason to doubt that, the door isn\u2019t locked I can go in whenever (hence her barging in) a closed door I\u2019m sorry really doesn\u2019t mean that much if it was locked to the point I couldn\u2019t get in yeah I\u2019d be suspicious but I have no reason to do so and the only reason I would possibly have is a theory that she might get pregnant. And that\u2019s not always the case.", "Totally disagree with you. I'd hate for my door to be open. Good sex ed can also help prevent pregnancy while the daughter can still enjoy alone time with her boyfriend with a closed door.", "Yeah, if you follow this subreddits rules being a stepparent is a bad deal. You have to love and care for a child like it\u2019s your own with zero exceptions but you are also allowed to make no parenting decisions whatsoever, expect any love or affection from the kid like a parent would get, and if you try to have the smallest opinion on parenting, you\u2019re an AH and need to move out. I don\u2019t really think this is a fair view. OP and stepmom should be trying to find a compromise, stepmom clearly cares about the daughter and is trying to look out for her.

They can have a reasonable ammount of privacy without the door being closed.\n\nAlso, while this might be an unpopular take (and is not at all intended as a judgement on you or your choices) I do not think that the vast majority of 15 year olds should be sexually active. It has nothing to do with purity culture, I am all for consenting adults participating in whatever floats their boat. However, making the choice to have sex can result in adult consequences, no matter how safe you think you're being. If you are making adult choices, you should be an adult capable of handling the consequences. And the reality is that most teenagers are not equipped to independently make good choices around sex, or deal with any of the consequences that arise from those decisions.", "I had very liberal parents who were frank with me about sex and protection.

If she lives with him, then ESH, but either way, girlfriend has no right to go behind his back and try to parent his daughter. That\u2019s automatic red flag, and her insisting she will parent her the way she sees fit no matter his feelings is automatic grounds to end the relationship. To put it basically, he had every right to tell his girlfriend she was wrong to go behind his back and parent his child, but IF it is a shared home, he wouldn\u2019t be completely in the right to tell her she has to just put up with something she isn\u2019t comfortable with; if it\u2019s his home and she just happens to be over when this happens, then he has every right to tell her she has no say at all in his home.", "That's great.
