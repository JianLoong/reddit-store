Exactly.. not their garden, not their place to comment.\nThey need to be responsible pet owners. The onus is not on you.", "Nta\n\nAs much as I love cats, you are in the right. They have a responsibility to keep their cats safe, and the best way to do that is to have them be indoor cats. \n\nSay you changed your whole garden on your own dime, what's next? Do you have to get rid of your car because it poses a risk to their cats? The kids are loud and scare the cats, guess the kids have to go. Your house blocks their view, buy a tent and demolish the house. Their choice to have outdoor cats comes with all the risks of *having* *outdoor* *cats*, and those are all risks that are their responsibility alone.", "NTA.  If they wanna suggest something then they better be ready to spend the money for it.  Their cat is not your problem.", "NTA. That's a completely unreasonable ask. Your neighbors can either keep their cats indoors, or take the risk that they might get into something poisonous. They can't alter the outside world for the cats they choose to let outdoors. Some people. Sigh.", "NTA. Outdoor cats aren't pets; they're nuisances. When i was young, we always put cayenne pepper in our garden to keep out cats.", "NTA like you said if they don't want anything to happen to the cats then they should keep them indoors.", "NTA, the sound like they shouldnt be pet owners. They can keep cats inside if they dont want them to get sick or hurt. The REALITY of having an outdoor cat is they can get hurt or sick by more things then just flowers", "NTA. Why should you be responsible for keeping their pets off your property? That's their responsibility. Outdoor cats suck anyway. My neighbors cats come over to my raised bed garden and use it as a litter box. They kill birds and leave them around my porch and yard. We've had to call animal control multiple times as cats are not allowed to run at large here.", "NTA. \nCats should not be roaming around outside. If they don't want their cats there they need to leash them or buy a catio", "NTA\n\nGood question though.  This is a common issue faced with neighbors.  People love to make their problems into your problems, and their life choices into your life choices.\n\nAsk yourself, what you would say if they came to you and said \"your dogs were dangerous to their cats, could you please keep them indoors or on a leash at all times?\"  That makes no sense, does it?  Why wouldn't they just keep their cats out of your yard?  .. and that's the answer.  Their cats do not belong in your yard, so therefor it doesn't matter what kind of plants you grow.\n\nYou put your foot down.  They didn't like it.  Too bad.  Plan on not having a good relationship with them, but that's their fault not yours.", "NTA.  It's your yard and they have no right to demand you change anything just for their cats.  If they're THAT worried about their cats' safety they should 100% keep them indoors.  My cats were \"sad\" when I don't let them climb into our appliances or eat my cacti but they got over it.  Sounds like they just don't want to take the time to provide any sort of enrichment for their pets.", "NTA. Your neighbors are very entitled. I would have responded the way you guys did. I would get cameras. I wouldn't trust those neighbors.", "NTA. They could build a catico so the cats can go outside and not be sad. Mine is indoors until I can build the catico I dream of for them.", "NTA. They can pay to put up barriers to keep THEIR cats in THEIR yard. It's not the responsibility of their neighbors to care for their cats. In fact, is irresponsible to let their cats wander off their property. So many cats get hit by cars or injured or killed by natural predators. Hawks eagles were a big issue at certain times of the year around my hometown and we kept our cats inside or were nearby when they were outside. In my current home, there are naturally growing poisonous to cats plants. Also gators, snakes, and large cats. We decided we would not have cats here largely because of those dangers and not wanting them couped up inside.\n\nYour neighbors are entitled assholes! I guarantee they'll call your hoa or the police on you at some point in the future. For this or some other perceived slate against their \"rights\". Get cameras! I also get a feeling they'll be sabotaging your plants and/,or your dogs.", "NTA. You have no obligation to change your garden for the safety of your neighbor's cats.\n\nI have no problem with cats being let outside. We let ours out when we owned cats. But when you do that, you understand it's a risk. Cats can get hurt/killed by things they encounter outside. That is something you must accept if you let your cats out!\n\nIt would be like saying to a neighbor, \"Your car might accidentally hit my cat when he's out, can you not drive your car?\"\n\nNTA.", "NTA. This is the risk of having outdoor cats. If they don\u2019t eat your garden, they\u2019ll eat someone else\u2019s, or get eaten by a coyote, or some other thing.  You removing the garden wouldn\u2019t do a dang thing to keep those cats safe.", "Ridiculous neighbors. Who do they ask for all the wild animals that are roaming around? They are a danger to the cats as well. It's their decision to let the cats outside so they also have to accept the consequences (hate to say it because the victim of it are the cats). \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nMultiple cat owner for many years. If I had this situation arise I would have offered to not only pay for cat safe fencing but would have either offered to install it or pay to have it professionally installed for them if they were amenable. If not I'd have to adjust to keeping the cats indoors.\n\nI actually have a similar (not identical) situation in real life. I've asked our neighbors not to put rat bait out as our cats (and our other neighbor's cats) take care of the rat population very well, but I also know that if they do there isn't anything I can do about it. It's the same risk we take worrying about owls or hawks. It sucks, but it's part of life.", "NTA. I have a dog and 2 cats (indoor of course - I wan them to survive) and I would NEVER EVER expect someone to alter their landscaping", "I have an outdoor cat and I can\u2019t imagine ever trying to impose something on a neighbor because of said cat. Also, I would think the cat would be smart enough to stay away after getting sick from the garden.", "NTA \n\nI love cats and dogs. It's my responsibility to keep my own animals safe. You are keeping yours safe. Your neighbor is not. \n\nTheir cats being free outside are exposed to more dangers than just your garden flowers. If they are okay with all those risks, that is on them. There are many options open to them. They can keep cats inside, they can use a leash, they can build an outdoor play area for them. You're not responsible for other peoples pets.", ">they asked why in the world would they pay for something for someone else\u2019s garden\n\nWhy in the world would you pay for something for someone else's cats? NTA", "NTA - Their cats, their problem.  This is WHY they should not let their cats roam freely.  Around here, we call roaming cats - coyote snacks.", "NTA idk when people will understand having an \"outdoor\" cat isn't okay. We aren't allowed to just let our dog loose in the streets all day or \"whenever they come back\". Cats should be treated like dogs when it comes to outdoor time. Supervised, within their own property with proper barriers in place. We take our cat out on a leash or in a pet stroller. We also are in the process of building a catio. It's called being a responsible pet owner.", "NTA. It is absolutely possible to give cats outdoor time without letting them trespass on the neighbors' property.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell them THEY need to solve this on your own, without any changes to your garden. And with any cost to YOU.", "NTA - I love cats but this is a ridiculous request. There are other solutions they can take, you can get things to put on top of your fence that spin when a cat tries to climb over or even a covered outdoor area. Their pets are their responsibility.", " NTA outdoor cats are pests", "NAH, but this isn't just about your neighbor's cats, it's about any local ferals or dumped former pet cats too. The only standing you have here is the myth(started by peta) that outdoor cats destroy the environment, completely untrue, and therefore owners of outdoor cats must love them less, also not true. But those cats aren't the only ones with access to your garden and one could argue that brining non-native plants into a garden risks a similar ecological destruction. Now, I'm not saying you're in the wrong here because of this, I clearly didn't name you an AH, but why can't you include feral and dumped cats into the equation, stop judging your neighbors by standards of dubious evidence by PETA, and find a way for everyone to feel safe and enjoy your beautiful garden? \n\nAnd fyi, I have a former outdoor cat and I super regret listening to that stupid rumor and making him indoor only, changed his entire personality.
