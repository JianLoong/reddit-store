Yes, ideally, your daughter should stick up for herself, but just leaving her to her own devices doesn\u2019t give her tools to address her. Nor should mom be fighting all her battles. \n\nYou also shouldn\u2019t be calling your wife names, that\u2019s messed up. \n\nHas anyone asked your daughter if she\u2019s upset by this?

She is defending your daughter.", "esh\n\nI frequently talk to my 13f about her friendships with people and how people treat her. It isnt always easy conversation but we need to guide our children into being able to recognize when things become unhealthy so they can correct the situation and make it healthy again or cut their losses. Teach your children how to set boundaries with people.\n\nYour wife could have handled the situation after the friend left but it also isnt a bad thing to speak up when someone is being rude to you or someone you care about. and having a 3 hour facetime time call and ignoring your host/friend isnt polite either.", "ESH except your daughter.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t EITHER of you think to have a chat with the girl\u2019s parents/guardians and ask them to explain to their daughter that this wasn\u2019t polite or appropriate?\n\nThe friend needs to learn that her behaviour was rude, but it\u2019s not harmful/bad enough behaviour to warrant either you or your wife stepping in and addressing it with the girl herself.", "I'm not sure if you're the AH or not.

It sounds like she came in too strong and it was good you discussed it though a shame you thought it appropriate to use abusive language. I think you might have some issues in you past that cause this incident to set you off so much. But of course I don\u2019t know. 11 yo girls can be brutal to one another (I used to be one) and this girl\u2019s rudeness should lead to some kind of rule (eg limit on FaceTime hours) being imposed. They will sort it out though \u2014 you\u2019re right there. I predict they will both find more compatible friends, and problem solved.", "NTA.  I was the kid with a parent who was constantly interfering to make sure I was aware of every possible thing my friends said or did that might have been a slight, and insisted that I \u201cstand up for myself.\u201d  Which generally involved being berated myself for things my friends said that I hadn\u2019t found offensive in the first place, or being ordered to tell them they couldn\u2019t say xyz anymore or I couldn\u2019t be their friend.  Needless to say, this neither won me friends nor taught me social skills.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter needs to learn social boundaries and when they're being violated. Her friend was being rude. Your wife fighting her battles on behalf of the kid will stop your kid from growing and learning how to socialize and express her feelings", "NAH. I think both of you have a point and both of you could be wrong. \n\nLike, you could see your wife stepping in as less \"fighting your daughters battles for her\" and more setting an example of how not to be disrespected. Because even at 11, it can still take a lot of future disrespectful situations before somebody eventually learns on their own how to stand up for themselves. If at all. So having a parent step in to at least let both of them know this situation isn't really okay, is at least a step in the right direction.\n\nThat said, if she's \"confronting\" in angry way and it's not a gentle talk. Then, sure you're right and she shouldn't be doing that.\nPlus, there's definitely something to be said for letting kids sort things out on their own. I think ultimately, if your daughter is getting railroaded in front of you, there's nothing really wrong with stepping in. And if you and your wife disagree about the best approach, definitely don't let your daughter see that. Or the other kid.\n\nSo yeah, I'm not one side or the other, hard to say without really being there. Both sides seem valid to me.", "NTA. Your wife is a horrible helicopter mom", "NTA. This is definitely an age appropriate situation for your 11yo daughter to deal with on her own. Also, how embarrassing for your daughter for her mother to start an argument with her friend. I know I\u2019d be mortified. \n\nI get your wife wants to protect your kid, but an adult picking a fight with a preteen is not an appropriate to support your daughter.", "NTA. You are reading the situation correctly. Parents need to stay out of their kids drama. Even more imperative is to not actually *be* the drama. \n\nYour wife\u2019s actions are the absolute worst kind of bad helicopter parenting. \n\nYour daughter\u2019s friend was a complete jerk to behave this way but it\u2019s up to your daughter to deal with her. Your daughter should be able to approach her mom and ask for advice on how to deal with the situation but then the daughter has to execute that advice.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re absolutely correct. Your daughter needs to fight her own battles. The best you can do as parents is to stay on the sidelines and talk with your daughter. Let her know your observations and ask her how that made her feel. Give advice when asked, but your daughter needs to be the one to confront her friend about her behavior, not you nor your wife.", "NTA and you\u2019re completely right. Your wife is just teaching your daughter to rely on you two to fix any disputes for her. This will not benefit her for skills in conflict resolution in the future.", "NTA. I understand feeling so overprotective of your daughter--but fighting her battles for her and especially at this early age won't do her any good. I would imagine the friend won't want to come over as much after this incident, so all your wife did was speed up the dissolution of that friendship and make your daughter even unhappier.", "NTA - you should only step in if you believe your child is in danger. Let them work it out. Your wife can talk with your daughter about her observations later.", "NTA. Been there with my own kids and it is tough to watch. Talk to your daughter when her friend isn't around. Help her voice her own concerns if she has any, and let her know it's OK to stand up for herself if she feels slighted.\nI will say this: today's social gatherings often involve texting/chatting with others. This nay very well be normal accepted  behavior.", "ESH (except your daughter) \nIf I were the mom of the other kid, I wouldn't have appreciated it if another parent called my kid out like that, even if she's doing something that the other parent disagrees with. I have had something similar happen recently, and I was livid that the other mom felt it was her place to talk to/discipline my child without having spoken to me about it. \nBUT I have also experienced this same thing, where my child wanted to maintain a friendship even as she was growing apart from a friend who had moved. Assuming your daughter how she wants to handle it would have been a better solution. Question: what was your daughter doing while this happened? Was she upset? Talking to someone else? Just doing her own thing? \nThere have been times when I have told all the girls at a sleepover that they need to put away their phones and watch a movie or play a game. At least once because girls invited over were talking to other friends. Sometimes redirection is the best choice. \nBUT yelling at your wife and calling names over it? That's not a great choice either. I often disagree with my husband over how we handle issues with our kids. But for the most part, we talk about it after the fact, away from the kids (yes, sometimes there's telling, no one's perfect) \nMaybe suggest your daughter has a sleepover with someone from her new school the next time.", "Nta", "You are right to stay out of it as it is now, but ofc pay attention to how your daughter is treated by her friend. Also, please dont call your wife a bitch, i understand you wanting to make a point for her, but thats not it.\n\nNTA for the question.", "NTA\n\nYour wife may even have the opposite effect she is hoping for, she may push the other friend away. I think any 11 year old would be intimidated by a friend\u2019s mother confronting them for relatively normal preteen behaviour. Yes your daughter\u2019s friend was being rude, but they\u2019re both figuring out how to balance new relationships with old - and friends will come and go. The girls need to navigate this themselves, for better or worse it will be a learning exp for both of them. As other commenters have said, you should have a conversation with your daughter about it and maybe give her some tips to approach it herself.", "NTA - Totally agree with you. This is a good growing experience for your daughter.", "NTA", "NTA your kid does need to learn to say what she's feeling and talk to her friend if she's upset or stop inviting her over.

Tell your wife that you were BOTH wrong, and ask her to sit with you and your kid to discuss what she thinks, what her peer group does, what she needs to learn, and how you can support her.  Sometimes she will be able to deal on her own. Sometimes she will need an adult to step in. That is fine. Come up with a code word.
