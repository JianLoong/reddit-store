I think both of you have a point and both of you could be wrong. \n\nLike, you could see your wife stepping in as less \"fighting your daughters battles for her\" and more setting an example of how not to be disrespected. Because even at 11, it can still take a lot of future disrespectful situations before somebody eventually learns on their own how to stand up for themselves. If at all.

I wished my mom had said something or suggested I could go to her with a codeword. Being excluded in your own home by your friend isn\u2019t anything I\u2019d wish on a tween girl. ESH", "I really prefer calm down vs. relax.  It is much more helpful  /s", "Nonono don't inquire, just assume. \"MuST bE ThAT TiME oF ThE MoNtH!\"", "If your daughter didn\u2019t have a problem with it you shouldn\u2019t either YTA", "You\u2019re the AH for cussing at her for no reason. Y\u2019all could e discussed a better way to handle this in the future you didn\u2019t have to be rude", "YTA .  What 11-year-old knows how to stand up for themselves, or know how to tell a good friend or bad, without a lot of intelligent, sensitive guidance? Don't abandon the child! Offer guidance. After three hours of your daughter being excluded from the friend's facetime call,  your wife did the right thing. These are hard skills to learn. Apologize to your wife and daughter, and learn some parenting and social skills, so you can help your daughter to learn. We are not born knowing how to do this stuff.", "ESH You being the way bigger asshole. Your wife's approach was wrong, but your solution is to call her a bitch and do absolutely nothing for your daughter either?", "You and your wife love your daughter. The moment could have been handled better by everyone (you, your wife, your daughter, her friend). That happens. Now that you are past the immediate moment; you and your wife can have a more considered conversation to get on more of the same page, and then there can be parent conversation with your daughter about how she can do/ would like to do in the future.\n\nBetween you and your wife, I do agree with the importance of your daughter learning to stand up for herself, with the tweak of helping her learn *how* to do that. While I wouldn't confront, I also see room for the possibility of a small nudge from your wife (a mild suggestion at the right opportunity, maybe).\n\nWhen you talk with your daughter, I hope you ask her first how she felt about her friend's behavior. (There is a possibility she was fine with it because she was busy texting a friend of hers or reading a book. Some kids hang out that way.) If she acknowledges it did bother her, I hope you ask her what she wishes she had done or thinks could help (letting her come up with her own solutions). Laugh together at her fantasy solution, praise her good ideas, ask if you can offer some tweaks or other ideas, and go from there.\n\nIt's also good to ask your daughter if she would prefer you/your wife do/say absolutely nothing or if she's OK with a gentle nudge. Funny thing, my oldest, who couldn't wait to be 'independent' is happy - even asks - to have me help sometimes (e.g., text her so she can tell her friends she needs to get home). My youngest, who loves hanging out with us parents, is very clear that she wants to handle things alone. I think, in their own way, both kids feel a certain security that mom and dad have their back while they test the waters of developing their independence.\n\nGood wishes.", "I understand better where your wife is coming from more than I do you.  Your child is still 11 and it is still on you both to teach her what is acceptable in any of her relationships.  Do I agree with how she went about it, I don't know as I haven't heard what you daughter thought about the whole situation.  Did she go to her mom to ask for help or to complain about feeling left out?  What would you have told your daughter to do instead?  \n\nYTA for calling your wife names in a disagreement.  Because frankly, in the life of preteen girls so many different variations of this kind of drama are heading your way, if the only solution you know is name calling...", "YTA. Three hours?! Your wife was right to step in. Maybe she should have pulled your daughter aside and given her the tools to confront her friend instead. But you are content to just watch your daughter be treated poorly with adults standing by and saying nothing. Yuck.", "ESH\nYou wide over stepped and so did you. You both are lacking emotional regulation and communication.", "YTA. Name calling is not respectful. Whether you say it in person or online, you are disrespecting someone in a role of respect in your life. Strangers online should never hear you call your wife that. And absolutely your wife should never hear you attack her in that way.", "NTA.", "Yea if you want your daughter to solve it on her own and she doesn\u2019t know how you might need to give her some direction and support rather than doing nothing.", "I think it\u2019s less about who is the asshole here and more about finding a better solution. I think that suggestion was very good and maybe bring it up to your wife", "Tell her she\u2019s overreacting.", "I have a herd of kids and if they call or text, they can directly tell me they want to come home but needan out. Sometimes they'll use a very obvious to us lie like, \"I need those replacement reeds before the concert\" and they're a choir kid. I'd call them annoyed and crabby demanding they get ready to get picked up because we need to replace those damn reeds before the concert and kid is coming home Now."]}
