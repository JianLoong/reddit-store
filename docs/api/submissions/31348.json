This sub has helped me with a different issue in the past and I\u2019m now back for more. \n\nOk onto the issue. My (33F) husband (34M) and I have struggled with TTC for more than 3 years. It shouldn\u2019t have been this long but we were only able to get a referral to a fertility clinic a year after we started trying and the fertility clinic itself had a waiting list, and when we finally were able to see a fertility doctor he did an HSG, then sent us home to try some more on our own. All in all lots of waiting. I don\u2019t really want to get into how I feel about al of this - I think anyone who has gone through infertility gets it. It\u2019s a depressing place to be in.\n\nLast year out of nowhere, our SIL (my husbands sister) and BIL announced they were expecting. They hadn\u2019t dated that long and don\u2019t really have stable jobs and are quite younger than us (SIL is 27), so we weren\u2019t expecting this. My parents in law were absolutely ecstatic , since it\u2019s the first grand child in the family. \n\nMy husband is not very close to his sister. For as long as we\u2019ve dated (at this point we\u2019re together for about 9 years), they\u2019ve never visited each other, or done anything together. Growing up they argued a lot and never really cared for each other. They have very different personalities , very different career paths. I\u2019m pretty sure if they were not related they probably wouldn\u2019t even say hi to each other if they ran into each other in town. \n\nI don\u2019t really know how my parents in law feel about this relationship. The one day in the year they want to celebrate together is Christmas Eve. It\u2019s a tradition that every year my MIL cooks and invites me and my husband, SIL and BIL over. It\u2019s the only day in the year that we see these people. We have no relationship with them. Usually we go but this year, with the baby , I\u2019m not really into the mood of going and putting a straight face. I know how it sounds but being around babies is difficult for me at the moment. We\u2019re also not that close to them, and I just don\u2019t very much see the need to spend Christmas Eve together this year. \n\nWell I mentioned this to my MIL and she called me an AH. Told me that I\u2019m ruining the baby\u2019s first Christmas and she practically told me she won\u2019t talk to me ever again and that our relationship is ruined . I tried explaining to her that over the past year we\u2019ve also had multiple miscarriages , one of which made me lose a lot of blood and we had to go to the hospital for and I just would like some peace and quiet for the holidays but she insist that I\u2019m not mentally OK and that I need to \u2018suck it up\u2019 so that we can do Christmas Eve like we always do. For the sake of the baby because \u2018how would your baby feel if your SIL does this\u2019. \n\nIdk Reddit. AITA for not wanting to be with BIL/SIL and the in laws on Christmas Eve because we\u2019ve been struggling with infertility?\n\nEdit: my husband doesn\u2019t care for Christmas. He just wants to keep the peace and keep my MIL happy, so when she said I am not mentally okay he told her we\u2019d look into therapy (which we won\u2019t because we\u2019re already in therapy). \n\nI\u2019m also very sorry if my description of SIL/BIL came out as judgemental. It is not the intention , just wanted to provide some context.

It reads as if you feel they don't have a right to the thing you're trying to have because they do life differently than you do.  People don't earn the right to procreate based on your standards.\n\nPeople are going to have babies.  I assume you like babies, so it would seem to me you'd be excited to meet a brand new family member.  But you're too busy thinking about how much more you deserve one than they do, so you're stuck in bitterland.\n\nBe happy for them.  Be happy to have a new nibling.  Go to the thing and see the happy new parents and their new little dumpling.  Call a therapist and get help dealing with your feelings about this so that it doesn't sour everything in your life.\n\nBest of luck to you going forward.", "I sttrugled with infertility for almost two years, I get it.\n\nBut YTA\n\nThey have a baby. Other people have babies. If you're 33 I'm sure some of your friends have babies or are about to have one. That's part of life. You need to learn to be around babies. You don't have to interact with them if you don't want to, that was hard for me for a while, but you need to be able to be around them.\n\nI'd advise you to go to therapy tbh\n\nETA: As far as you know they may have been trying for a long time and suffered from fertility and loss as well. Saying that it's sudden for someone who's in a stable relationship at 27yo to have a baby... You really sound jealous more than anything else. And again, some jealously is normal and expected, and know I felt it. It's what you do with it that matters.", "YTA - for how you have handled this, not for necessarily not going. \n\nYou\u2019re not that close so overall so you really could have said anything else as to why you couldnt come, a little white lie would have made this situation so much better. But telling your MIL you cant go because of the baby was an AH thing to do. I\u2019m sorry youve struggled, and that\u2019a got to be heartbreaking but\u2026 people have babies. And will continue to have them. \n\nI also think you\u2019re coming off a tad judgmental about about the SIL\u2019s relationship.", "The way you speak about your sister in law and brother in law is not very nice, sounds like you're looking down your nose at them.\n\nI understand its difficult for you but you can't just avoid babies forever and they are family. Soft YTA", "YKTA. I have struggled with fertility issues for years. Multiple miscarriages, some very painful, all heartbreaking. But I still went to family gatherings, and tried my hardest to make sure no one felt they had to be ashamed of their joy because of my loss. They weren't having babies *at me*. They were just living their lives, and I don\u2019t have the right to ruin that for them. I had 3 of my closest friends all announce pregnancies within a couple months, right after my 4th miscarriage. It was rough, but I still tried my hardest to be happy for them. And trying like that quickly helped me actually be happy for them, even though my initial, private reaction was hurt and a bit of anger. I worked through that grief, because I couldn't expect everyone to stop living their lives just because I was struggling with infertility.  ........................................................................... As for your SIL, 27 is not young for having a first kid; it's on the higher side of average. And while she might not have been with her partner as long as you've been with yours, that doesn't mean they aren't ready to be parents. That's for them to decide, not you. And you said yourself that this is the only day out of the year you're together. You can suck it up for one day and try to be happy for your family. No one is asking you to babysit or throw her a baby shower. You can deal with one family holiday. You're strong enough to do it.", "YTA \n\nYou cannot avoid family just because they were successful at having a child. You may never have a baby. Do you plan on avoiding babies and children forever? Feelings of loss and jealousy are okay and not unexpected in your situation, but the world also doesn't revolve around you. \n\nI am hearing that you don't think they deserve this baby because the pregnancy \"came out of nowhere\". You are angry because this may have been unplanned and yet they get to have a child. When you said they were young, I expected 18. 27 is not young. It's a normal age for having kids...almost 30. \n\nThat's how life works sometimes. You never had an issue with your husband's relationship with his sister until a baby was added to the picture. You don't get to decide that she isn't important. You're trying to rationalize avoiding Christmas Eve with his family because a baby will be there. I hope you're in therapy. \n\nDon't deprive your husband of his family. Don't put a wedge between you. His needs are important, too.", "YTA\n\nI see posts like this a lot. People dealing with infertility don\u2019t want to be around babies or pregnant people - like actively go out of their way to avoid baby showers and meeting the new baby. But as soon as the infertile person gets pregnant it\u2019s a complete 180 and all they want to talk about is their pregnancy/baby despite having everyone walk on eggshells for years. And then the infertile person gets mad when people don\u2019t want to show up to their baby shower or hear stories about their pregnancy. You can\u2019t have it both ways. Also, you speak in a very demeaning way towards your SIL. 27 is a perfectly fine age to have a baby and as long as you aren\u2019t funding the child why do you care what her job choice is? The jealously is real and I think you should just suck it up as this will be your niece/nephew and if you do have children it will be your children\u2019s cousin", "If BIL/SIL were being assholes themselves and rubbing their baby and their ability to conceive in your face, then you not going would be justified.  However, it appears that none of that is the case.  Depression and grief around fertility isn\u2019t fun but letting it consume your life is unhealthy and letting those emotions affect relationships around you is also unhealthy and borderline toxic.  Babies are a part of life and it\u2019s unrealistic to avoid every situation where there could be a baby.  \u201cSucking it up\u201d isn\u2019t a solution but you need to find a way to manage your depression and emotions in a way that doesn\u2019t affect your relationships with other people so soft YTA.", "YWBTA - if you can't handle a single afternoon in the presence of a baby, you need to get some therapy. They're not expecting you to babysit, it's not a week-long visit, etc.\n\n(It's a *weak* YTA and I truly expect to be downvoted for being pragmatic.)", "Have you considered that since you aren't close to your BIL and SIL that they would never share any struggles with you? You don't know if SIL has ever had a miscarriage or stillbirth, or if anything traumatic happened in her life. I'm someone who looks like I get pregnant out of the blue, and infertile family seem to hold this against me, but I actually do have my own story, I just don't share. People have babies. It's cruel to hold that against them just because you can't.  \nYTA for this reasoning.", "YTA your feelings and triggers are your responsibility. (Also, hugs and go to therapy).", "I would not call you an AH but people are pregnant and having babies all the time. This is a time of celebration for your husbands family first Christmas and all. You can keep it together enough for a few hours, gonna be hard but you can do it. Tell your husband that you will not be holding the baby and make it his job to keep that from happening. DON'T tell MIL that or she will definitely put you on the spot trying to hand the baby to you. Stay a couple of hours then leave. The main person you need to make this clear with is your husband then he won't be pushing you to stay longer.", "YTA\n\nI undestand having your own feelings, and you should get support for those feelings if you need it.

Everything else you've stated is just an excuse to make that jealousy seem more valid.", "[removed]", "YTA. \n\nI struggled myself and it was so hard. We had friends getting pregnant without even trying or trying for one month. I was miserable. \n\nThat was my issue though. Babies and pregnancy won't cease to exist just because we have issues. That's not fair to others. \n\nAlso 27 is not young. I was 27 when I had my kids. That's a pretty normal age to have kids.", "Don't go if you don't want to, and it sounds like losing a relationship with MIL might be a good thing...however, you really need to back off of his sister and her husband.

Doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re super close with them and also doesn\u2019t sound like your husband respects your feelings on this matter. Not just a MIL problem but a husband problem too. The holidays are already really hard for people who are experiencing infertility and pregnancy loss, it\u2019s normal to feel like you can\u2019t handle being around babies and frankly it comes up frequently in the infertility subs. But also don\u2019t expect to be able to burn these bridges with your husbands family and then have them be interested in celebrating your pregnancy and new baby if it happens for you two one day. \n\nSoft YTA for how you speak about your SIL/BIL and their pregnancy. They don\u2019t live their lives in the same way you do and maybe they did get pregnant without trying but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t deserve their baby. It comes off as very judgey, like you think you\u2019re better than them and the universe should owe you a baby. Which really just isn\u2019t a healthy mindset.

From one human who experienced miscarriage this year to another, it does help.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to do anything you can't cope with - as a general rule but especially when you're grieving. If you had broken a bone no one would force you to walk on it before you were ready. Healing from grief and trauma is the same. I've had multiple miscarriages and years of infertility and it's taken me years and a lot of therapy to be OK with situations where a baby will be the entire focus of attention. It still depends on my mood/general mental health but I'm so much better now! Pregnancy announcements don't make me suicidal! I can interact with parents of babies without hyperventilating! It's great! But that took SO much time. And I literally wouldn't have got there if I hadn't given myself the time to grieve/heal. Actual time, not the approx. 3 weeks the rest of the world thinks is appropriate to get over a death/tragic loss.\n\nIn future, don't give your reasons unless it's someone you really trust.

First one I had to have an emergency D&C due to hemorrhaging so badly.  I also saw an RE (fertility specialist) to try to conceive.  I did 5 IUIs and eventually was able to have my now 11 year old daughter.  I know you didn't ask, but why are you staying with the same RE if they are making you do all that waiting after an HSG?  After the results from that, your immediate next steps should have been discussed.  Time isn't on a woman's side when it comes to fertility as you know.  My sister was going to a different RE and they basically told her she would never have a child.  I told her to switch to my doctor because that attitude was shit.  Well she now has an almost 4 year old.  I'd seriously consider switching doctors if I were you.\n\nDuring the time I was trying to conceive I was on two fertility websites and messaging with other women in the same situation.  When I had my losses, I still got on there to support others when I was able.  I realize that might not appeal to you of course.  They were great with support though.  It did suck to hear others getting pregnant so easily all around me.  Even going to Target was tough.  I would avoid the baby aisle even.  That being said, when family members got pregnant, I still supported them.  I can't imagine avoiding them.  Babies are everywhere which can't be avoided.  It's a situation where you can be supportive of someone else while still being sad for yourself.\n\nI highly recommend joining a fertility group online or in person to be around people going through exactly what you are going through.  I don't know how I would've got through it all without their support.

Just absolutely fucking disgraceful behavior. \n\nAnd it speaks to the real issue here, which is not so much your struggle with infertility as it is the utter lack of connection, compassion and support you and your husband receive from his family, especially as you\u2019re going through this.

You\u2019re not saying you hate kids or never want to be around them. You\u2019re just saying that right now, this is a step too far for you and that is fair enough. Spending Christmas Day watching everyone cooing over a baby sounds pretty torturous given what you\u2019ve been through.

This sub has helped me with a different issue in the past and I\u2019m now back for more. \n\nOk onto the issue. My (33F) husband (34M) and I have struggled with TTC for more than 3 years. It shouldn\u2019t have been this long but we were only able to get a referral to a fertility clinic a year after we started trying and the fertility clinic itself had a waiting list, and when we finally were able to see a fertility doctor he did an HSG, then sent us home to try some more on our own. All in all lots of waiting. I don\u2019t really want to get into how I feel about al of this - I think anyone who has gone through infertility gets it. It\u2019s a depressing place to be in.\n\nLast year out of nowhere, our SIL (my husbands sister) and BIL announced they were expecting. They hadn\u2019t dated that long and don\u2019t really have stable jobs and are quite younger than us (SIL is 27), so we weren\u2019t expecting this. My parents in law were absolutely ecstatic , since it\u2019s the first grand child in the family. \n\nMy husband is not very close to his sister. For as long as we\u2019ve dated (at this point we\u2019re together for about 9 years), they\u2019ve never visited each other, or done anything together. Growing up they argued a lot and never really cared for each other. They have very different personalities , very different career paths. I\u2019m pretty sure if they were not related they probably wouldn\u2019t even say hi to each other if they ran into each other in town. \n\nI don\u2019t really know how my parents in law feel about this relationship. The one day in the year they want to celebrate together is Christmas Eve. It\u2019s a tradition that every year my MIL cooks and invites me and my husband, SIL and BIL over. It\u2019s the only day in the year that we see these people. We have no relationship with them. Usually we go but this year, with the baby , I\u2019m not really into the mood of going and putting a straight face. I know how it sounds but being around babies is difficult for me at the moment.

The \"must have stable jobs\" mentality actually contributes to women waiting too long and struggling with infertility.\n\nIn the long run, it would probably be better for you to be part of your niece or nephew's life, even if you aren't able to conceive. But the baby won't notice your absence during this first Christmas. And you could always find other times of the year to visit with those family members.", "Honestly, NTA.\n\nYou already realized your SIL ist right. You are, in fact, mentally not okay. Why should you be? Multiple miscarriages within a year, infertility - all of that is horrific and, of course, takes a toll.\n\nYou took action. You began therapy. You drew a line regarding what you can handle right now and a new baby in the family is on the other side of that line right now. That's fair. \n\nYou have to take care of yourself first, your relationship second and then friends and extended family. You know what you can handle and you act on it. I find that admirable.\n\n\nOn a personal note: I have been exactly where you are now in every single detail four years ago. You will survive this and it will get \"different\". Have hope.

Babies exist. This baby in particular is going to be a tangential part of your life for years. You will have to learn to cope with this. \n\nChanging a long-standing tradition just because there\u2019s now a child involved isn\u2019t okay. How would you feel if the places were reversed? How would you feel if, next year, or the next, you do have a baby, and people say \u201cno, I won\u2019t come if the baby\u2019s there.\u201d It\u2019s very hurtful, even if it\u2019s people you don\u2019t have anything in common with.

I would encourage you to go to, but not the way the MIL did. Feel like you should not go because MIL was over the top.", "NTA!!!!! I'm really surprised and sickened by the hate you have received. The lack of empathy deepens my already jaded view of humanity. I have not struggled with fertility or have children, yet I can deeply empathize with your situation. I know how deeply and agonizingly painful it is to have to watch everyone else around you enjoy something that is extremely important to you. You have tried so hard to achieve what you want most but you feel like you're spinning your wheels. Add salt to injury if on top of the misery, it seems like everyone else achieved that thing effortlessly. It's like starving or being thirsty and being forced to watch everyone else eat or drink while you can't. It feels like being naked in a winter storm while you see everyone else in puffy warm winter clothes, It's absolute torture. I'm deeply sorry to hear about your experience. I support you not going to your SIL/BILs for Christmas. Christmas time is supposed to be a happy joyous time, not a time to just have your deepest insecurities and pain points rubbed into your face all day.

It's your choice of course but if you avoid this baby, you won't have any relationship with the child and you may well damage other relationships in the process - with your SIL, your BIL, your MIL and by proxy maybe your husband.", "YWBTA I know how you feel. It fucking sucks really truly. In fact I have a strong feeling its about to happen again this Christmas to us. \n\nThat said you can either play the avoidence game and miss out on so many great things and BTA (I have been there and done that too) or you can embrace all the good things in your life like your spouse, your career and one day your little niece or nephew. \n\nThats the route I take now. I bring my nieces and nephews over, become physically exhausted, spend way to much money and get my house destroyed by the cute little tornados then return them to their parents, then me and my spouse go home crack a bottle of wine and think to ourselves maybe this lot in life isn't so bad afterall. \n\nDon't be the asshole OP you got this!", "NTA, because I assume none of what you wrote in the post would be shared with BIL/SIL\u2026other than a polite fiction of \u201cnot feeling up to it this year. \u201c People you only see once a year don\u2019t get to know your private reasons for doing anything. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your MIL went a little batty.

Ultimately, regardless of whether or not you get along with SIL, the event is put on by your MIL. It's important to her. It's not about you. \n\nWhat you're dealing with, it's not easy. But ultimately you do need to learn to handle it. Regardless of whether or not you find success in the journey to deal with your fertility issues, life is going to go on around you. Your friends, your coworkers, other family members, are going to have babies. Are you just going to avoid all of them because it's too hard being near babies? That's not the answer to life. \n\nObviously your mental health is struggling. That's understandable and to be expected. But what you need is therapy, not to avoid things. Work with a therapist to process your feelings around it and learn how to live with them and move on, rather than pull back.", "Soft YTA. I am sorry about your losses and understand your struggles, but the world doesn't stand still because of it. You can't expect others to put their life on hold to cater to your feelings.

Given your age, I assume that some of your friends will have (or already have) kids - do you intend to avoid them as well?

That's a bit non sensical for me. 27 isn't too young for having a kid. Also, you say you're not even close to them, so how would you know it's out of nowhere? Couples have sex. Babies happen. That's normal life.\n\nI know this aint the main point of your post, I just wanted to show you that you're being a bit irracional on your thoughts and feelings. And that's again why I believe therapy will help you a lot to cope with your frustration. \n\nPeople won't stop having babies because you still don't have one.

Whether OP is recognizing it or not, I feel she\u2019s falling into that pattern of thinking - especially with the way she characterized her SIL and BIL.

We don\u2019t bother each all year long but I need my Xmas Eve photo for fb.", "\"i know it's insensitive, but have you considered that \\*I\\* enjoyed it\"\n\nlol unreal", "I just wanted to know because I'm sure she's just throwing that out to find sympathy", "I\u2019m willing to bet it\u2019s just weed which is legal in plenty of places and where it\u2019s not legal delta 8 is (which will still cause you to test positive). No one gets their baby taken away for smoking weed. And if it\u2019s harder drugs then she probably should be reporting them. I\u2019m 99.9% sure it\u2019s not a hard drug otherwise that would be in the original post to make him look like an addict which he clearly is not.", "The way OP spoke about her BIL and SIL is absolutely jealousy.", "I\u2019m sure it\u2019s very painful, but OP\u2019s characterizations of her family are not nice. It kinda sounds like the MIL took a page from OP\u2019s book or at least matched her tone", "As a mom I'd care about their well being enough to know that this might hurt for them. Do I really want them all together at the cost of their misery?", "You\u2019re right, no one is \u201cowed\u201d anything. However, that doesn\u2019t change that OP is the AH", "Its not a big reach to assume someone wants all their family to be together on the holidays.", "Yeah, but calling CPS will make their lives difficult for no good reason.", "I\u2019ll add onto this bet and say OP doesn\u2019t know for sure because they only see these people like once a year. So in her mind if BIL talked about his \u201cwild\u201d early twenties (smoking weed & drinking) that must mean that he\u2019s an alcoholic & drug addict which also means they don\u2019t deserve their child but her & husband do.", "It\u2019s a want. If it was so important, there are about 360 days that are not so as emotionally fraught as Christmas Eve."]}
