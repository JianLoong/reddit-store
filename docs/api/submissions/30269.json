Quick cold things to just eat . We get to the checkout it comes up more than what I had in my account . I look at him tell him I have less than that. He tells me then I guess you better but stuff back . Well I did. I put my food back and took it off and let him have his 15$ sandwich and salad. I got my tampons and toilet paper because I guess I had to choose that over dinner. We get back home I sit down and told him I hope he enjoys his dinner I\u2019ll eat tomorrow at my business . He then tells me then this was a lesson for you then since your broke. I have 250 dollars that supposed to last me two week. We don\u2019t do anything on weekdays and barely anything on weekends . So I tell him so you told me to put things back and you seen me take all my food out and you as a husband couldn\u2019t help not even go half?. AITA for assuming my husband will help? \nBackstory he wanted me to quit my job and do my business and he would take care of the bills.

I also initially missed he makes four times what she does. He is a colossal jack@$$.", "Having been through a relationship where I was the victim of financial abuse because everything was \"our\" money, and I had to account for every penny spent and justify it, I will never pool money with a partner again. It made it much harder to take care of my own physical needs. Things like conditioner, tampons, my anti-depressants, etc were set aside if we didn't have the funds, but he always made sure he had the funds for things like his smokes (cost WAY more a month than my meds), airsoft, or takeout when HE wanted it. \n\nI agree that finances should be worked on and agreed to as a team. I would happily discuss my finances and plans and such with a partner and agree on who contributes what, and would expect us to cover each other when one falls short for whatever reason (unless that's an ongoing issue where one partner is always falling short. Then a discussion needs to be had about why. Is the split inequitable? Do they have budget issues? Are costs rising? Or do they have a hard time controlling spending? Then a solution should be mutually agreed on). But I will never again have a joint account. I will never again have to answer to somebody for every nickel and dime I spend (I'd say pennies, but Canada doesn't have those anymore, lol). I will never again allow myself to be fully dependent on another's financial decisions (especially regarding my finances), and I will never again allow my income to go into an account that has any name on it other than mine (even a joint one). \n\nMany people, especially women, are advised to keep their finances separate for safety issues. Because the absolutely most amazing person can change once you have no way out. People who have been victims of financial abuse, or grown up in a household where one parent controlled the others finances, will refuse to pool all resources because it simply isn't safe in many cases.\n\nEdited to add: this is just an explaination of why some couples are your money/my money. It is not in any way a judgement in those who share finances completely. I can respect that there are those who actually feel safer pooling their resources completely.
