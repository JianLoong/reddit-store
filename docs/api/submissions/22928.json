It's a large ferry and there is an area with cubical desks that have power outlets for people to use. The ferry has no Wi-Fi service, but I simply use my phone as a tether on my data.\n\n So I'm playing Call of Duty with my headphones plugged in and out of nowhere this kid ( I'm guessing he's about 7 or 8 years old) runs over to me, puts his hands on the desk and just stares at me screen as I'm playing. I glance at him and shift over slightly because he's riiight in my personal space, standing less than an inch from me. I could hear this kids mouth breathing. He just stood there. I take my headphones off and look at him and say \"Uhhh hey buddy do you mind? Where's your parents?\" He looks over at me for a second and turns around and YELLS \" MOOOM I wanna play CoD!\"  I was shocked. I turn around and this woman is standing behind me. She says \"No honey, that's not yours, but you can watch him play if you want\" At this point I'm super uncomfortable and this kid is still standing an inch from me. He makes a face and again YELLS \" MOM I WANNA PLAY!!!\" At this point people are looking at us and I'm getting pretty annoyed. The woman looks at me defeated and says \"I'm sorry but is it OK if he plays for a bit?\"  I couldn't believe she felt entitled enough to even ask. For context, I have a high end gaming laptop and I would never let some kid put their grubby hands all over it.  So i replied \" Uh Sorry but no. Do you mind asking him to not stand so close?\" She lets out this sigh and says to her kid \"OK honey lets go this man wont let you play\". \"MOM I WANNA PLAYYY!!!\" She looks at me again with pleading eyes and I simply say \" Sorry but No, this laptop is expensive and I'm not letting some strange kid touch it\"  Now the kid looks like I cancelled his Christmas and begins SCREAMING \"I WANNA PLAYY, I WANNA PLAYYY\" The mom grabs him and drags him off but no before giving me a sneer and says \"It wouldn't have killed you to just let him play for a bit\" As if I'm somehow responsible for her shitty kids happiness.  \n\nAs they walked off some of the other passengers were still watching and I saw a few of them were giving me disapproving looks.

My husband's friend came on the laundry one day and I didn't know him but he was his friend.  He offered to take my kids to buy candy.  I was like Nope. I don't care who you are.  Nobody takes them anywhere.  To which point my daughter started screaming. She wanted to go. She wanted candy.   The man came back with a bunch of candy.  I said OK and took it home.   And threw it in the trash.  In front of her.  Because number one.  That's not your daddy.  Why would you scream to go with a man you have never met before.  We don't take candy from strangers.  So that'd my answer.  The mother should have dragged her kid to the opposite side of the boat and left you alone.

This would have been a really good opportunity for her to help her son deal with his feelings of disappointment.  But at this point he's had 7 years of getting his own way, and he's already a real piece of work.
