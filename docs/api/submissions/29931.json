My husband works 4 days a week and I work 3 days a week, with one of our days being the same and having my son with a sitter. That means the 2 other days that I work, my husband is caring for our son. \nI got pissed off yesterday because every time that it's just my husband and my son together, my husband sits on the couch the entire time and sits on his phone or watching anime. Will not get off the couch, feeds him lunch and breakfast late, will only pick our son up if he walks over to him on the couch. If he is across the room and starts crying, my husband tells him over and over again to come here rather than getting up and picking him up. \nHe will not sit on the floor and play with him. Doesn't give him snacks. Gets mad/frustrated if my son is being emotional/sensitive (he's an infant so those emotions are completely normal). When I get upset and tell my husband to be more present with our son, he tells me \"I'm not like you, I don't have the same connection you do with him (our son)\". That was his response when I told him to be on his phone less around our son.  So now is it up to me to make sure he gets human interaction?  Should I just quit my job and be a SAHM? Sell my car so avoid the car payment I won't be able to afford if I quit? \nKeep in mind we live in Alaska due to the military and have no family or support system up here. Yesterday I was ready to walk out, take my son back home but then I'm sure my husband will magically start to care about being a family and try to charge me with kidnapping.

My husband was similar. He just really couldn\u2019t figure out my oldest son as an infant. I thought it was because I\u2019m a child development specialist and he was just deferring to me, but a friend with many older kids said \u201cit takes Dads about 5 years to find their sea legs.\u201d Now, it didn\u2019t take mine that long (also military.) By 18 months my son was talking and a lot more interactive and their connection flourished. By time my second was born, my husband was a totally different Dad. He was confident. He\u2019d figured out the play, the routine, the food. My mother at the time said \u201cdon\u2019t make any rash decisions before 18 months\u201d and I\u2019m so glad she did because I honestly hated him at first. But he found his sea legs and now the oldest is about to turn 10 and he\u2019s a rockstar Dad and honestly, the default parent if he\u2019s home. \n\nSo I agree with others- tell him to get his act together. He doesn\u2019t have to be all connected- that\u2019s putting a lot of pressure on him. But give him some suggestions of things he can do with him. Teach him to use a baby carrier so he can mow the lawn with him or go on a hike with him. Set some alarms so he knows when food time is. Ask him to commit to keeping the TV off when kiddo is awake. Is there a play group he can take him to on base? I know the Canadian base in NWT has a group called \u201cplay troop\u201d that\u2019s open to all families. \n\nHe\u2019s not an asshole for needing some help figuring out how to connect with a baby.

Unfortunately this man is clearly not up for the task. That response of his was \"I know I am a bad parent, but it's easier to make an excuse for that than to actually do something about it\".

Poor kid", "This is a tough one. \n\nWhen my son was born, he was our first kid and everything had to change after that. We had to babyproof everything, all hobbies were dead in the water for 5 years, our sleep was cut down to 4 hrs or fewer per night for years on end, we could no longer go out whenever we wanted, money got real tight, etc.\n\nAll of those changes at once plunged both my wife and me into a difficult place. We were basically just putting one foot in front of the other to get through the day and night. It was a period where both of us felt very little except tiredness, frustration, and grief over the fun, enjoyable lives we would seemingly never have again. \n\nMeanwhile, in the middle of all that is a kid who refuses to sleep more than 2 hours and is constantly trying to do dangerous things that will potentially hurt him if we take our eyes off him for a second.\n\nAdd our stressful jobs to the mix as well.\n\nI\u2019m going to be very honest here. I personally couldn\u2019t feel much of a connection through that constant brain fog. I didn\u2019t feel much of anything, I was just too tired and stressed out to have the luxury to feel anything. It was like slogging through a swamp and just putting one foot in front of the other. I thought my wife had a biological advantage, due to the very real hormonal effects of pregnancy and childbirth that men don\u2019t share. \n\nI\u2019ll add that my relationship with my children today is fantastic. \n\nAnyway, my point is that I think there\u2019s some storybook response we expect people to feel when they are in these circumstances, but at least for me the reality was much different. Few things in life actually feel like how stories say they should.\n\nThese conditions lifted when a few things happened:\n\n1. We were able to get back to 6 hrs of sleep per night.\n2. Our son became a bit older and easier to manage.\n3. We became removed enough from our previous lifestyle that we no longer missed it.\n\nThe second kid, our daughter, was way easier. We had already made our adjustments, and knew what to expect, so it was just natural to introduce her into the family. \n\nFights are so likely to happen during that stage.

Infancy has critical bonding periods for your little guy to feel attached to you and your husband which includes your husband giving him attention and responding to the baby\u2019s emotions in a way that helps your son learn to process.
