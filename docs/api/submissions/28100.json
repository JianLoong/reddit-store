He'd caused problems before, and I was sick of it.\n\nAfter that, if I'm interesting in something, I just go alone, at my own pace, and do what I want.\n\nMy friends aren't happy with me because I don't tell them about this stuff.

It's just this one guy causing the problems.  But, because I'm good friends with his brother, it's almost like a package deal.", "It's usually the same guy causing the problems.

But I'm really good friends with his brother, who will call him out on his shit.  His other brother actually kicked his ass which is a funny story in itself.", "That's what I was thinking, but I started feeling a little guilty a because I've some have said \"Oh, I'd have gone to that if you'd have said\".\n\nBut, I always get that image of the entire group, and then the drinking, and then the tantrums.  And I go right back to wanting to go alone again.", "The pandemic really messed things up for us.  But, when we hang out at someones house, play video games, or go play football.  Things are usually awesome when we do that.\n\nBut when we go out in a group, that's when the problems happen.  And when it does happen, it's usually this one guy who is the brother of one of my really good friends.", "I'm not blowing the group off.  We still hang out and do other things.  But when it's a concert, or something like that.  I've been going by myself.\n\nIt always seems to be when we go out as a group to these things is when problems happen.", "But if you're doing the planning and inviting, you get to pick the itinerary, and Goofus doesn't get a say.", "Dude...there's actually a trope for this guy: the Friend Nobody Likes.  He's the Sheldon of the group.", "Sounds like you need to have a chat with this guy and your friend group then and see if he can change or how much the group really wants him in it. I think not inviting any of them is a little extreme but can understand that you dont want to exclude the guy by himself. Not sure him literally getting his ass kicked by his brother is great. If he's dealing with physical hits from his family then it might be contributing to his personality. I think you need to either fix your friend group, or leave it and get a new one. If you stay as is, your friends are just going to become more upset that you never invite them to hang out with you when you go to events.", "But the post basically says it was because of this one person.   If you want to go to a concert, invite one or two people to go with you, rather than the whole group with this person.  And, don't you have other friends that aren't part of this clique?", "Well, not to go into too much detail, the reason why his brother kicked is ass is because the guy spat in his face, over an agument.  It wasn't like a \"I'm gonna punch you because you're being a tool\" thing.\n\nI think this Christmas, I might try to organise something myself, and see how it goes and maybe start involving them a little more.  If he doesn't have any involvement in organising it, maybe it might lessen the chances of him causing problems.  When he acted up, it was always \"Well, I have the tickets\", or \"Well, I booked this!\" so if it's not him, he might not throw a tantrum."]}
