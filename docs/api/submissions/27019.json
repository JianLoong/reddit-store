We don't really get along that well, and most of it is because he always berates me for things that aren't even true and makes fun of me for everything I do.\n\n  Today he got mad at me, and made fun of me, because I had to go to the city (40 km away from where I live) to pick something up and my dad drove me even though I have a driving license. (I hate driving that far from home, it gives me anxiety, and my dad offered to take me. If he didn't want to do that I would have taken the bus.) He started saying that none of them should ever have to drive me around bacause I have a license, and that I don't know how to do anything, and then it somehow got to the point where he started saying that I'm wasting my parents' money in college because I don't study, which is not true. (I don't have the best grades, but they are pretty average for the field I'm studying. My over all grade is 7.1 out of 10, and I'm studying Software Engineering. I would have never gotten that grade if I never studied)(This fight happens at least once every few days) I got mad, and left, without saying anything else as to not escalate the situation.\n\n   A few minutes later my mom calls me over kinda angry and tells me that I have to clean the whole house (this is most likey because my brother always complains that I am lazy and don't do anything around the house, even if I do). I said I will do that but I won't clean my brother's room because he doesn't deserve it, as he is always being mean to me.\n\n  After I was done, my mom came to my room and asked me if I cleaned my brother's room, to which I said \"No. He doesn't deserve having his room cleaned by me when all he does is berate me for everything\". \n\n  She first started trying to guilt trip me into doing it, because my brother works and he can't clean his 10 sq meter room because he is tired (he didn't go to work today, he only did some stuff outside around the house, the mess from which I had to clean up). (Can you tell who her favorite kid is?)\n\n  Then she came back and started saying that if I don't clean it now she will make me wake up at 6 am, after he leaves for work to clean it. I argued about it, and said that he could clean it if he really wants the room clean, but I won't do it. Mom then said that it's a small room, and it won't take me long to clean it, and I said that my brother can do it then, since it's his room.\n\n  She got mad and said that he is a boy and he doesn't have to clean, and that it's my duty as a girl to clean after him.(She is talking about male and female roles like I didn't help them carry and stack wood two days ago. In my family's head, a girl should do both male and female tasks, and the man should only do the male tasks. Honestly f*** gender roles).\n\n  Needless to say I didn't clean the room yet, and I probably still won't tomorrow. \n \nSo, AITA?\n\nAlso sorry for my grammar, english isn't my first language.", "created_utc": 1694895673, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16kh0o5/aita_for_not_cleaning_my_brothers_room/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should not have to clean up after your brother\u2019s messes or cater to his needs when he is so disrespectful and entitled. I am also a woman with an older brother who grew up in a patriarchal house. I was expected to clean most of the house, so I stopped. \n\nWhy is it our job to clean up after others, even when they won\u2019t do it for us?

I have to be able to make enough money to live on my own. Rent is like 400 euros in the city my college is in, and I really want to stay there after college too. Usually I live in the dorms, because it only costs 45 euros/month and I don't have to pay utilities. \n\nAlso the phrase exists. I just won't say it here.", "I'm not Indian. I live in Eastern Europe. \n\nMy dad tried to stick up for me sometimes, but most times he just stays quiet. On rare ocasions he even agrees with them.\n\nEdit: Also moving out is not an option yet as I don't have the money to live alone.", "Forgot to mention, my family doesn't pay for my education. It's paid by the state because I got a good enough grade at the entrance exam, and now I have a good enough grade to still get state funding for it. It's not really a scholarship. The way it works It's that there are 220 spots paid by the state and like 80 that you have to pay for your edication. If you pay or not It's decided by your grades. If you drop past the 220 spot you have to pay.", "Thank you so much! At the moment I'm trying to focus on school, so I can get a good job and make enough money to move out. I hope I will be able to get out of here soon.", "My door does have a lock, but my mom and brother go absolutely mental if I use it, because they know I only use it to lock them out. Also tomorrow is sunday, and my grandma keeps her Church clothes in my room, as she doesn't have space in her room, and comes to get them in the morning. \n\nI will look into the Grey rock method tho. Thank you", "I got the impression you lived at home. Is it only during the holidays? Do the dorms close then? Honestly it sounds like living in the dorms is your best option. You shouldn't let your family keep you down.", "Sorry, I presumed India, because this happens there frequently.\n\nDo you have like Women Support groups or organisations who protect women from Domestic Abuse/ Excess labour... \n\nReach out to them and find out what is legal in your country.\nGet Dad to understand how difficult this is for you.", "Then how about University accommodation or Youth Hostel nearby.. May be if you have time you can do part time jobs as well.", "You are doing a great job!! Keep up the great work and think of the great life waiting ahead of you! I am so excited for you to be carving out your own path!! I don\u2019t know you but as a woman I am so proud of you for being so smart in such a male dominated field. I am rooting for you!!!", "Dorms are not closed during the holidays, but they cost more. Also living in that city costs a lot of money in general. It's a very expensive University center in our country (3 top universities here). My parents aren't really willing to give me the money to stay there if it's not absolutely necessary. Also I had plans this summer and I couldn't stay in the dorms because of it, because I would have to pay rent even for the time I didn't stay there, and it just wasn't worth it. ( had a one week family vacation, then a few weeks later I went to a music festival that I won free tickets to, then I had to go to two weddings two weeks apart). Couldn't get a job because of those plans either, because I would have had to change plans that had been made for months. I only have 2 weeks left before moving back in the dorms, if I get a dorm room, because you get one based on your grade. If I don't get one my parents are willing to pay rent if it's absolutely necessary (they at least really care about my education), but I probably won't hear the end of it, because even now my mom makes comments like \"we don't have money for something, and when you go back to college I will have to give you money\"", "Honestly, I know what those groups are, but I have never heard of those kind of groups around here. \n\nAlso my dad sometimes tries to stick up for me, even my mom tries to on very rare ocasions. It's just that my brother always gets them (mostly my mom) to think I'm in the wrong.", "Honestly I might try part time jobs starting my second year. I wanted to only focus on studies in my first year, and kinda get used to being in college before getting a job. It's just that the college schedule is pretty chaotic. Sometimes I would only have one 2 hour class a day and some days I would have 8 hours of classes. Also if it's an even number week I have different classes than if it's an odd number week. It's really wierd and it's really hard to find jobs that accommodate that.\n\nI will move back in the dorms in two weeks if I get a dorm room. It's all based on my grade so we'll see", "Thank you!"]}
