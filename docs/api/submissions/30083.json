Good on you for keeping her in check. Proud of you for that as not a lot of people would do that to a stranger, much less their own sister.", "NTA she\u2019s an idiot, as soon as people figure out she can\u2019t explain the coding, it\u2019s gonna blow back in her face.  She could lose her job. The best thing for her to do is say she was so nervous that she forgot to give the proper credit.", "NTA. Your sister could be in serious trouble, if she continues with this kind of \"collaboration\". Theft of intellectual property is frowned upon in all circles! Imagine how bad she'll look, when the truth comes out!", "NTA - You SHOULD call her out. She is being dishonest and effectively stealing his work in order to aggrandize herself.", "Info- did the colleague not have their name written/typed down in the presentation to show his part of the work?", "NTA.  She could possibly be fired if her bosses find out she misrepresented this as her work.", "This is no different than stealing.  Knowing who wrote what code could be important down the road.  NTA.", "NTA and she's lucky to have someone in her corner willing to call her out. This is an unethical business practice that could cost her both now and in the long-run, and what a crappy way to take advantage of someone who had better ideas than she did. \n\nI'm fighting feeling super pissed of here lol. She stole from someone. She deserves consequences.", "Hell no you did the right thing, as an artist, i feel happy knowing u exist, u wouldn\u2019t stop seeing someone getting no creds for their effort and work! good job if anything :)", "NTA. But people like your sister are in every workplace. The best outcome would be that her colleague has learnt that they can\u2019t trust her and won\u2019t ask her again.", "NTA and I think your sister knew she was misrepresenting it as an assumption that it was her own work during the presentation.", "A work presentation isn't like a presentation in school. You don't list off who contributed because the product belongs to the company and there is an assumption this is a accumulation of multiple ppls hard work. If you are the manager of that area it's assumed that your team produced the product and if you aren't the manager then your supervisor would know who contributed what to the final product. \n\nDid your sister represent the work as solely her own?", "INFO: Do you and your sister work in the same place and have the same job?
