Some close friends live down the street and we exchange pet-sitting services, which works out great. These friends have agreed to check on the house and take care of the animals except for 2 days of the trip when they are unavailable. \n\nI asked another close friend to cover those days, and she agreed.  This friend has also taken care of the hens once in the past, and my husband has stated that he has no problem giving this friend a key while we are away.\n\nWhen I told my husband these friends would help, he asked why I didn\u2019t get his mother to do it because she also lives nearby and this would \u201cget her out of the house.\u201d\n\nHe already knows that I am uncomfortable giving our families keys and access to the house while we are away. It is a privacy and trust issue. They certainly wouldn\u2019t steal or wreck anything; rather, our families adhere to strict religious beliefs (we do not) and I keep many aspects of my life private from them. This  isn\u2019t a new boundary. Our close friends, of course, do not pose the same problem. \n\nMy husband said that I\u2019m overthinking it. He continued by saying, \u201cwhat do you think she\u2019s gonna do? Snoop?!\u201d and \u201cyou really don\u2019t like her, do you?\u201d And \u201cshe told me to give her a key and I said I would.  What am I supposed to do now?\u201d \n\nI again stated my concern and, since we both live here, we must both be in agreement before giving anyone a key, even if it is temporary. \n\nTBH, aside from the above, I do not trust that she would follow my instruction for the hens or maintain the general schedule for feedings. She has a pattern of being selfish, irresponsible, and lazy, to put it bluntly. If I were going to make an exception for a family member, it would be someone I could at least trust to follow the feeding instructions. I did not plan on telling my husband this, because it is a secondary point. \n\nNow I\u2019m tired of discussing this with him and irritated by his insistence. I\u2019ve bit my tongue about his mother\u2019s behaviors in the past and generally just do not go there. I feel like he\u2019s now pushing my limits. I\u2019m worried that he will just give her a key and not tell me, just to preserve her feelings or accommodate her demands. \n\nAITA for not letting my MIL have a house key?

I would literally change the locks every few weeks until he swore a blood oath to drop it and never give his mother a key.", "Agree. It doesn\u2019t sound hard, and yet ..", "You\u2019re my hero!", "LOL! Mine is too lazy to move furniture, so at least there\u2019s that?", "Good point. I hadn\u2019t considered timing to discuss the other details. Thank you!", "Well that makes two of us on the jaded front because my instinct says OP needs a camera system in the house while they're away if only to have proof if MIL does end up with a key and goes snooping (rather than returning to a feeling that things have been messed with but nothing to prove who it was so MIL and husband get to call OP paranoid rather than fessing up to anything)", "Yeah. It's always easy from the cheap seats", "I was going to suggest this too!!! But held back, lol.", "I was thinking more along the lines of changing the locks as soon as they return from vacation so that if MIL does have a key, it'll then be useless. And once they're back, there's then no need for MIL to have a key.", "Agree to give her a key but put a camera in your living and bedroom areas while you are away (.dont tell hubby or her). and then you will know if she goes snooping.", "NTA\n\n\"You know full well that I don't trust your mother unsupervised in our home. The only reason I can think of for you to bring this up when there has been no change in her attitude or behaviour is to cause an argument between us. Is that true?\"\n\nAnd when he whines that he's already told his mother he'll give her a key, shut that down instantly:\n\n\"Don't make promises you can't keep. Tell her that you will not be giving her a key and that you made a mistake. Don't throw me under the bus and blame me because you made a mistake.\"\n\nPerhaps all of this sounds harsh, but when people continually push your boundaries, being harsh is the only option left. And to be clear, it's not your MIL pushing. It's your husband. If he doesn't like the things you've mutually agreed upon, he needs to directly address it with evidence to back up why he wants a change. Not try to manipulate you into doing what he wants with guilt trips and pressure to keep sneaky promises he made behind your back.", "NTA", "NTA. Tell your husband why you don't want to give her a key, but you know he is going to do it anyway. Tell your friends the situation that if they see anyone other than who you designated, call the cops. Sure, she will tell them her son gave her a key, but it will pass her off, and good for that. You know she will snoop, especially if you have concerns s about her.", "NTA.

No arguments.", "Tell him if gives her a key without you agreeing you\u2019ll change the locks. It\u2019s always suspicious to me when in laws ask/insist they should have a key. Also, emergency keys should be given to people who can get there the fastest.", "NTA dont let untrustworthy ppl in. especially religious untrustworthy ppl", "NTA. But if you do end up giving her a key, get a Blink indoor camera from Amazon.  They're cheap.  Let her know that the camera is there and set to record any motion inside the house.  She gets a key (only while you're gone) and everyone wins.", "NTA. Just give her a fake key. If she\u2019s so trustworthy , then she will never use it. If she says randomly that the key doesn\u2019t work. Ask her why she was trying to get in the house.", "NTA and stop biting your lip on this issue. Communication is essential. Tell him exactly why you don\u2019t want her to get a key.", "Oh, he's absolutely going to give her a key. Possibly already has. So you have to decide what fights you want to have; welfare of the hens, personal privacy, your feelings about his mother...take your pick.\nThis can get as ugly as you want; hidden cameras, booby-trapped underwear drawers, dummy pornography labels on videos, you name it.\nUnfortunately, your husband seems to have neglected to detach the placenta from his mother when he married you. Only you can decide how important all your wishes are to you, because hubby has already chosen his side.\n\nYou're NTA for wanting to keep religious, neglectful MIL out of your house, but being right isn't enough here.", "NTA but he better not give her a key. Tell him that he had no business promising her a key when it's your house too and he needs to tell her she isn't getting a key; this is a huge trust issue.\n\nShe will definitely snoop and won't feed the hens on schedule", "I am genuinely curious and confused since I've seen this so often on reddit, with especially mothers/ mothers in laws having a key to the house.\nIs this an amarican thing or what is it? I've never met anyone who gives their parent a key to their house, unless its for pet sitting, watering plants, etc, if they are gone, and they get it back when they return from holiday. \nBut on here, it seems to be a standard demand: \"You are now married, give me a copy to your house even though I live 5 hours away\"", "Fantastic idea!!!!", "It should be the last time they ever let her in the house!!!", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83c\udf1f", "Tell him that if he does go behind your back and gives her a key after you've drawn that line as a boundary then he is showing you that not only does he not respect you, your marriage, or your home but also that his mother and her wantscomee before you and that he's choosing to make her his number one priority which in turn means that you'll need to think long and hard about if that's something you can live with or if you need to part ways for you to be able to find someone who will always put you first and make you their priority.", "Hey, my mom never had a key to my house and I'm in America. If the mom is a regular babysitter, that would be one thing, but otherwise,  I don't see the need. When I moved out of my parents' house, I didn't keep a key, either. I only got only later when my parents started having health issues.\n\nI agree it's odd.", "You know MIL will want yo keep the key or make a copy.", "There's no need for MIL to have a key now other than she's decided she wants one - OP has already arranged house and animal care for the time they're away.\n\nPlus, once OP caves once there's nothing to stop her husband from just giving MIL a copy of the new key (or even if she doesn't - either way a precedent will be set, assuming husband doesn't intervene to stop the locks being changed to begin with seeing as he's apparently all for his mother having free access to their home)"]}
