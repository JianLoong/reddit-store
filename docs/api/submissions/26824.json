{"id": 26824, "submission_id": "16i3t4q", "title": "AITA for not giving MIL a house key?", "selftext": "My husband and I planned a vacation and needed someone to feed our hens and check the mail while we are away. Some close friends live down the street and we exchange pet-sitting services, which works out great. These friends have agreed to check on the house and take care of the animals except for 2 days of the trip when they are unavailable. \n\nI asked another close friend to cover those days, and she agreed.  This friend has also taken care of the hens once in the past, and my husband has stated that he has no problem giving this friend a key while we are away.\n\nWhen I told my husband these friends would help, he asked why I didn\u2019t get his mother to do it because she also lives nearby and this would \u201cget her out of the house.\u201d\n\nHe already knows that I am uncomfortable giving our families keys and access to the house while we are away. It is a privacy and trust issue. They certainly wouldn\u2019t steal or wreck anything; rather, our families adhere to strict religious beliefs (we do not) and I keep many aspects of my life private from them. This  isn\u2019t a new boundary. Our close friends, of course, do not pose the same problem. \n\nMy husband said that I\u2019m overthinking it. He continued by saying, \u201cwhat do you think she\u2019s gonna do? Snoop?!\u201d and \u201cyou really don\u2019t like her, do you?\u201d And \u201cshe told me to give her a key and I said I would.  What am I supposed to do now?\u201d \n\nI again stated my concern and, since we both live here, we must both be in agreement before giving anyone a key, even if it is temporary. \n\nTBH, aside from the above, I do not trust that she would follow my instruction for the hens or maintain the general schedule for feedings. She has a pattern of being selfish, irresponsible, and lazy, to put it bluntly. If I were going to make an exception for a family member, it would be someone I could at least trust to follow the feeding instructions. I did not plan on telling my husband this, because it is a secondary point. \n\nNow I\u2019m tired of discussing this with him and irritated by his insistence. I\u2019ve bit my tongue about his mother\u2019s behaviors in the past and generally just do not go there. I feel like he\u2019s now pushing my limits. I\u2019m worried that he will just give her a key and not tell me, just to preserve her feelings or accommodate her demands. \n\nAITA for not letting my MIL have a house key?

You nailed it BOTH parties have to agree.  Plus, it's not like you've given your parents a key.  And let's be real - of course she'll snoop.  NTA.

He promised he'd give mommy a key without getting your agreement first. The electronics are partly because that has made him less than trustworthy, and MIL is already untrustworthy.
