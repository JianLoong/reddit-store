While in a divorce no she wouldn\u2019t get any of the money, I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t marry her if you thought it would end in divorce.  Since you are getting married saving the money should somehow benefit you both in the long run.  If you live together and had a major expense or bill you were paying on together and she wanted the money to pay that off I\u2019d see her point of view, but your post doesn\u2019t discuss a good reason for her wanting the money.  I get good bonuses and cash from a side hustle and first thing I do is pay any no interest payments due balances which benefits me and my boyfriend who I live with then save the leftover for the next house project or expense.  Often when one of us has more cash than the other, the one with more money no questions asked will just pay a little more on bills or something.

A quote and a fable.  \n\nThe quote is from Maya Angelou. \u201cWhen people show you who they are, believe them the first time.\u201d\n\nThe fable is that of The Scorpion and The Fox.\n\n\"A scorpion was walking along the bank of a river, wondering how to get to the other side. Suddenly he saw a fox. He asked the fox to take him on his back across the river. The fox said, \"No, if I do that, you'll sting me, and I'll drown.\" The scorpion assured him, \"If I did that, we'd both drown.\" So the fox thought about it and finally agreed. So the scorpion climbed up on his back, and the fox began to swim. But halfway across the river, the scorpion stung him. As the poison filled his veins, the fox turned to the scorpion and said, \"Why did you do that? Now you'll drown too.\" \n\n\"I couldn't help it,\" said the scorpion. \"It's my nature.\"\"\n\nBeings behave in their nature.  It isn't about good or evil.  It's appreciating things for what they are, people for who they are.  Appreciating doesn't mean you have to subject yourself to their dangers.  You can admire from afar.\n\nOn a side note, I plan on getting a fox and scorpion tat at some point.  It's a good reminder.", "Def a joke! Good on you for the educational comment!", "Wow.

When you recognize that people behave the way they are wired to?  The need for resentment, prolonged anger, hatred?  It can go away.\n\nAn example I used for a friend occurred when I bought a fancy toaster off Amazon.  Tried to use it once, smelled the smell of burning wire, and it never turned on again.  It was inconvenient, and it was money wasted, but could you imagine dwelling on the toaster?   Could you imagine letting the toaster take up kitchen counter space, hoping it might actually function?\n\nThat toaster will never work for me, but thats okay.  There are more toasters, and instead of spending time in anger or despair over the toast I don't have, I can actually make meaningful effort on getting the toast I want.\n\nNOTE:\n\nI'm not saying people don't change.  I'm not talking about things like habits.  I've changed numerous things about how I live my life over the years.  Maturity does bring change.  I'm talking about things that are more fundamental.  Revelations about how a person places value on things, how a person treats others, how a person sees themselves in relation to the people they are supposed to care deeply about.  Do those revelations align with your beliefs?  Your inclinations?\n\nLife is short.  Seek happiness.", "I needed to read this today. Thank you \ud83c\udf3b"]}
