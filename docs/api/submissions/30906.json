But splitting up a sum paid specifically to one person into two separate and personally owned accounts is not within the normal expectations of shared finances and unless you have a made specific financial agreements with your finance around splitting all income 50/50 then this is an unreasonable request from them.", "I'm confused as how to losing the tip of your finger meant you couldn't wash yourself ?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While in a divorce no she wouldn\u2019t get any of the money, I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t marry her if you thought it would end in divorce.  Since you are getting married saving the money should somehow benefit you both in the long run.  If you live together and had a major expense or bill you were paying on together and she wanted the money to pay that off I\u2019d see her point of view, but your post doesn\u2019t discuss a good reason for her wanting the money.  I get good bonuses and cash from a side hustle and first thing I do is pay any no interest payments due balances which benefits me and my boyfriend who I live with then save the leftover for the next house project or expense.  Often when one of us has more cash than the other, the one with more money no questions asked will just pay a little more on bills or something.

You got an injury settlement. Shes entitled to zero $$. Shes kinda showing her gold digging colours here. That money is for therapy training and whatever else you may need because u lost a digit.", "Why didn\u2019t you call off the relationship?", "Depending on your jurisdiction, she might have had her own claim (although saying you being depressed made her depressed seems a bit of a stretch) but that doesn't entitle her to your settlement.  That money was calculated on the basis of you and your injury. It's a full and final settlement to do you until you are dead. Once that money is gone, it's gone.", "That is so ridiculous of your gf. So in other words she wants 75k for doing what the rest of us would do without a second thought  I.e. take care of our other half why they were recuperating. You lost part of your hand. No wonder you were depressed and anxious. If this is how she behaves I wonder how bad ahe would be if something even worse was to happen and with that in mind I would seriously consider calling off the engagement too as it doesn't sound as though you will be able to rely on her in the future. As partners you should both have watch others backs and she obviously doesn't.", "If you call off a wedding, the engagement is over too.

That money is compensation for that digit. \n\nIf you gave her a cent of this, she would most likely take it and leave you. I hate this for you, but this relationship is over, man. Don't let this very glaring obvious example of who she really is fly right past your face.", "Couples are supposed to be there for each other through sickness and health. You got injured, you didn't put her through anything.", "This is a huge red flag. \u201cWhat you put her through\u201d?! Don\u2019t wanna tell you what to do but damn, I would not marry this person.", "NTA Unmmm the vows you take usually say \u201cin sickness and in health\u201d. Clearly she wants a payout for the times you are sick.  Good call calling off the wedding. But if I were you I would call off the whole relationship.", "Lunacy. People struggling with injuries or mental health during a relationship doesn\u2019t mean if the other person is affected by it they get to claim emotional damages.", "I think you both need to talk...\n\nThe relationship seems to be aimless.", ">I've been considering but I hate that money makes people this way\n\n\nNot all people. Not good ones. But yes, money makes HER this way, and that's not something you want to tie your life to.\n\nAnd I'm gonna guess you already showed your gratitude in numerous ways then and since.\n\nI'm totally serious. Say \"OK, since you want to put a dollar amount on your  share of the \"suffering and effort\",  let's negotiate. I value it 2k and not a  penny more. Take it or leave it.

It just took money for you to notice.", "Oh, then perhaps she needs a consolation prize to walk away with in the tune of 75 grand.

Bought her so much shit and always thanked for to the point it got annoying. She even had to get surgery while I was still in rehad ad couldn't use my hand, and I still took care of her, washed dishes.. Took out trash cleaned etc even tho it hurt\n\nCool. Bill her 75k for that, and you're quits.\n\nDude, she's HORRIBLE.", "Yeah, certainly sounds like she's been waiting for her money this whole time.  \n\nDid you agree to get married between this incident and now?  Because that would suggest to me there's a strong likelihood that a big factor in her agreeing is her thinking that if she didn't, she wouldn't get \"her\" money.", "Doesn't sound like someone who's worth spending the rest of your life with. It will just get worse after marriage.", "Oh, okay. I'd have just put a plastic bag over my hand and secured it with something and kept it out the shower, it wouldn't cross my mind to ask someone to help me!

I can see how your injury impacted on her, not 75k of impact.\"\n\nShe didn't just make it about her, she quantified her love and support and submitted an invoice.", "I talk to her about that but every time it turns into a,\" you don't understand how bad you hurt me\" situation.

Her reaction to the payout was revolting.", "It sounds like you shouldn't even marry her until she grows up a bit", "Time to move on, she won\u2019t change and you\u2019re a fool for wasting time thinking she will.

Not her.money, NOT her injury. Break off the engagement.  She is ridiculously entitled for doing what many good humans would do for a loved one. Use some to go on a fab vacay-alone- and put the rest away for the future.", "I think you know the right thing to do. \n\nDefinitely don't split the money. It's not payment for the recovery period, it's compensation for having to live with an injury, which she doesn't have to.\n\nNTA.", "It sounds as though you think she might need to grow up some?  Seeing if she'll mature?\n\nLook, young adults showing particular personality traits are likely not going to change without some drastic life event causing it. This is who she is.  The way she reasons is not going to magically disappear with age.  \n\nI've been around for a bit.  I've never met an inherently entitled and selfish young person that wasn't still that way years later without some major traumatic life occurrences.  \n\nLook at who she is now.

NTA", "She literally gaslighted you in those instances. That's textbook emotional and mental manipulation and abuse. You need to leave her for good or she will continue to hold things over you like that and it will get worse. She's hiding behind playing the victim and using your own struggles and feelings against you as to have control of you. You need to run as far away as you can and block her on everything and make sure you tell everyone EXCEPT HER  before you do cause she will probably try to reach out to everyone you know to paint you on a bad light and claim you hit her or something, from the context of what you've said in the replies she seems the type. You deserve better. Stay safe and gtfo of there as soon and as safely as you can.", "You hurt her? Cmon.
