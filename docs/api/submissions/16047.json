We have a lifestyle that allows us to eat out whenever we like, and live in an area with lots of good food and unique resturants. We also like to share our favorites, and so recently have begun inviting either my parents or his parents out with us. We take them out maybe once every 3-4 months (not including celebrations), and because we invite, we always pay. This isn't the only time we see our parents. \n\nA few months ago, my in laws invited us out to a resturant they liked near their house. We hadn't ever been, and even though it wasn't a place we normally would have chosen, we figured it was their way of \"joining the fun\" and showing us something new like we had shown them. After dinner, my MIL slid the bill over to my husband without looking at it. He looked surprised, but dinner wasn't expensive, so we paid it without saying anything. A few weeks later, my in laws invited us out again, to a moderately expensive place we had taken them once before, and did the same thing. \n\nRecently, while on a call with his Mom, my husband mentioned that I had gotten an award at work.  His mother immediately suggested we all go out to a very fancy resturant nearby to celebrate. I quietly asked if we were going to have to pay for it, and my husband stated glaring daggers at me. He ended the call quickly, and called me rude. I told him I didn't think we should have to pay every time his parents wanted to go to dinner, and that they were using my award (which really wasn't a big deal at all) to get a fancy night out. He said we could afford it and they couldn't (this is true), and I was an asshole for refusing to pay for them. Later, after he had spoken to his dad, he told me I had embarrassed his parents and made them feel like moochers. They want an apology, and to make up for it, he said we should just take them out to the fancy resturant they want. No pretense of celebrating my award this time. \n\nAITA? I don't feel like it's wrong to expect not to pay when you're invited out.\n\nBecause I know someone will ask: yes, in an attempt to resolve the fight with my husband, I suggested holding off on fancy resturant until their anniversary at the end of summer. They want to go now. Also,  splitting the bill is apparently not an option and suggesting that was rude, too.\n\nEDIT: Because MANY people do not understand that I did not attack my inlaws: The phone conversation between my husband and my inlaws happened in the other room. He walked into the room I was in and gave me a brief rundown of the dinner plan from across the room,  and I very quietly said \"Who's paying?\" That's it.

Would he feel the same if it was your parents inviting you out and expecting you to pay?", "NTA.\n\nWhat your husband and parents are doing is apparently their dynamic, and if they want to do that, that's fine. But anywhere else, it would have been rude for the inviters to expect the invitees to pay.\n\nAs such, your husband does not get to call you rude, for the following reasons:\n\n1) if it had been anyone else inviting you and then making you pay, it _would_ have been rude\n2) it is his business that he's happy to pay for his parents, but you should have been clued in on this, so you wouldn't have been surprised\n3) one could even argue that since it's your money too, you should have been consulted\n4) all the compromises you suggested were completely valid, and should not have been called rude\n5) your husband calling you rude, then, is a knee-jerk reaction he has to anything threatening his parents' feelings\n\nFind out whether he's a total momma's boy, or just genuinely wants to see his parents happy. Him wanting to treat them is perfectly okay, except that you need to be okay with it too. You guys are married after all.", "Your in-laws changed the dynamic when they broke etiquette rules of slipping the bill to your husband (ie directing him to pay vs accepting an offer) and failing to pick up the bill when they invite.  They made it obvious that they are looking for a free treat vs exploring new places when they started suggesting return visits to places and using you as an excuse for an extravagance that you wouldn\u2019t do.  \n\nI can\u2019t believe they doubled down on the moocher thing and your husband is somehow blaming you.  They are moochers, and they know it.  And they are getting off on flexing their power over you in making you apologize for seeing that they are mooching\u2026while still mooching.\n\nPeople are complicated but I\u2019m guessing they aren\u2019t comfortable that you guys are wealthier than they are and this sort of power play is a free way to put you in your place even if you have more money than them.  \n\nI\u2019d be done going to dinner with them.

Idk how at this juncture of 2023 I still continue to be baffled by people\u2019s entitlement. It really is mindblowing to me. Your husband sounds like he should order the backbone entree at the next dinner.", "NTA - i don\u2019t understand why someone (regardless of their relation to you) would invite YOU somewhere and expect YOU to pay", "NTA... And fuck literally all of that noise. They ARE moochers.", "NTA\n\nAnd there's a reason they think you called them moochers - because they are. My mom always comes to visit twice sometimes 3 times a year and we go out to eat. She pays for everyone every single time. But I also make sure I have enough to cover me and my wife's food at least so I can offer. She turns me down but the one day she can't afford it, I got this", "NTA - They invited you therefore it's on them to pay unless it is previously agreed that you will pay.\n\nThey know what they're doing!

But then they'll use that as an excuse to get another free meal later...", "NTA \n\nIt's lovely that you and your husband treat the parents and in-laws to a free meal at a nice restaurant every 3-4 months, but it sounds like your in-laws are starting to expect to get a free meal at least every month.\n\nYour husband clearly doesn't have a problem with this, but if his parents gets a free meal every month, why not your parents too?\n\nShared finances should have agreement on shared expenses. If you and your husband have separate finances, then he can pay for his parents out of his fun money.", "NTA. \n\nYou stated in your post that because you invite them, y\u2019all always pay. Which is the standard for dining with others. Unless it a double date & each couple pays for themselves. \n\nThe fact your in laws invited y\u2019all out, you expected them to pay. They didn\u2019t even ask or anything but slid the check to your husband to pay as they expected y\u2019all to pay. This happened more than once. There is nothing wrong with your reaction to them wanting to go out to \u2018celebrate your award\u2019. As you took it as them taking y\u2019all out to celebrate but because of their past behavior you wanted clarity on who would pay. It doesn\u2019t even sound like you asked rudely. Just matter of factly. At least, that\u2019s how you made it sound in your post. \n\nYour husband, on the other hand, is making excuses for his parents for acting like moochers.

Especially with their response to celebrate your award. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe them an apology and your husband should be on your side.", "His parents are just rude.  You don't invite someone to dinner and then ask them to pay for it.

Yep.  \nNTA and hubby needs to get on your side.", "NTA. I'm not wealthy and don't have the money to eat out. My parents do. They invite us out and pay for us sometimes, but I would never invite them out and expect them to pay. If they want to invite us out and offer to pay as a gift, I will gladly accept, but to invite them out and force them to pay would be rude as hell. What you said made them feel like moochers because they ARE moochers.", "Do you share finances with your husband?", "NTA - You don't invite someone for dinner and then expect them to pay it in full. Maybe you'd expect them to split it, but definitely not to foot the entire bill. They are moochers... unless your husband has specifically told them not to worry about it in advance.", "NTA. You had your own fun thing going on between you and your husband and your in-laws invaded it and took over. Whereas before you would occasionally invite each set of parents out to join you on a foodie adventure, now you're having to go to restaurants of your in-laws choosing and getting stuck with paying the bill out of obligation. \n\nIt's not a fun thing for you anymore because of them and you're starting to dread their \"invitations.\" \n\nYou don't owe them an apology and you *certainly* don't owe them a night out at a $200-per-person fancy restaurant. That's ludicrous.", "NTA inviting someone out and expecting them to pay is disrespectful.", "Nta- they are taking advantage.  If he's willing to pay with his money, cool. But if you're expected to cover this: play sick & tell them to enjoy their selves. Them being embarrassed is not your fault.", "NTA, your in-laws are mooching off you. They are acting entitled and your husband is enabling them. You should refuse to go to dinner with them.

That\u2019s tacky & rude in my opinion.", "Nta", "NTA If you can't afford to go out, don't go. If you would like to invite them it's  up to you, but you don't have to pay everytime you went out. I would stop going to dinner with them.", "NtA. Why do you have to apologize because you called them out for being moochers? They could at least PRETEND to fight over the check, but to just slide it over? And instead of you inviting them, they invite themselves?  It's all too much.\n\nNtA", "NTA this is absurd to ask anyone out and not foot the bill. They could\u2019ve ask you to tip and they pay. Or split the bill.", "NTA.

I have paid for my parent/step parent when I do the inviting, but it is always after a \u201ctussle\u201d over the bill. If it was their turn, they would win. If it\u2019s my turn I would win. My parent/step-parent earn more than I do, but it\u2019s a nice thing to do for family. If we just expected it, it would no longer be a nice thing and would likely stop.", "WHAT?!   So NTA.

Don't apologies,  I would say your not happy to go out with your in laws until the boundaries are agreed. I would consider separating your finances.

So OP really is the golden goose here and a generous one to boot so the manipulation/guilt tripping/selecting the most expensive things from *his* parents feels even more exploitive.", "NAH, I think this is an issue between you and your husband more than your in-laws. If you can afford it it's not a big deal right. It's odd for them to invite you out and expect you to pay I will agree but it's not a big deal to pay for a meal for your parents which might be where your husband may be coming from.", "It\u2019s fine if you want to invite his parents out sometimes on your dime.

You owe him an apology.\n\nI\u2019m agnostic on the apology to your in-laws. To me, it depends on how comfortable you are financially. If you have plenty of money and everyone knows it, then I\u2019d say YTA for that too. If you\u2019re careful about money and this is messing up your budget, then it\u2019s a complicated situation and everyone should have handled it as such - in-laws, husband, and you - instead of just assuming you\u2019re all on the same page.", "YTA. You should\u2019ve brought this up with your husband when it first bothered you. Instead, you blindsided your husband and his parents.

They\u2019re rude and presumptuous and need a reality check.", "If he\u2019s rational about it, consider showing him this thread so he knows he\u2019s very much in the minority.", "OP, any chance at all that his parents have been getting your individual or joint couple financial info & history from your husband?", "Why? They did it twice and got away with it without anyone saying anything. Lack of communication is the main issue here imo.", "$800?!?!??", "One because it was tacky the first two times it even happened. And two they are using OP\u2019s success to get free food . They were ah the first two times and are still ah now", "Op said in a comment the place ILs wanted to go was $200 a person", "Yes it was but how are they supposed to know it's not okay if no one tells them that? People can't read minds.", "They know exactly what they are doing is wrong hence why they were offended when op simply asked if they would pay that time. No insults no nothing but they themselves said they felt like moochers so let\u2019s play dumb they know. And guess what they want as an apology a free expensive dinner ."]}
