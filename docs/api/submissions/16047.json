We have a lifestyle that allows us to eat out whenever we like, and live in an area with lots of good food and unique resturants. We also like to share our favorites, and so recently have begun inviting either my parents or his parents out with us. We take them out maybe once every 3-4 months (not including celebrations), and because we invite, we always pay. This isn't the only time we see our parents. \n\nA few months ago, my in laws invited us out to a resturant they liked near their house. We hadn't ever been, and even though it wasn't a place we normally would have chosen, we figured it was their way of \"joining the fun\" and showing us something new like we had shown them. After dinner, my MIL slid the bill over to my husband without looking at it. He looked surprised, but dinner wasn't expensive, so we paid it without saying anything. A few weeks later, my in laws invited us out again, to a moderately expensive place we had taken them once before, and did the same thing. \n\nRecently, while on a call with his Mom, my husband mentioned that I had gotten an award at work.  His mother immediately suggested we all go out to a very fancy resturant nearby to celebrate. I quietly asked if we were going to have to pay for it, and my husband stated glaring daggers at me. He ended the call quickly, and called me rude. I told him I didn't think we should have to pay every time his parents wanted to go to dinner, and that they were using my award (which really wasn't a big deal at all) to get a fancy night out. He said we could afford it and they couldn't (this is true), and I was an asshole for refusing to pay for them. Later, after he had spoken to his dad, he told me I had embarrassed his parents and made them feel like moochers. They want an apology, and to make up for it, he said we should just take them out to the fancy resturant they want. No pretense of celebrating my award this time. \n\nAITA? I don't feel like it's wrong to expect not to pay when you're invited out.\n\nBecause I know someone will ask: yes, in an attempt to resolve the fight with my husband, I suggested holding off on fancy resturant until their anniversary at the end of summer. They want to go now. Also,  splitting the bill is apparently not an option and suggesting that was rude, too.\n\nEDIT: Because MANY people do not understand that I did not attack my inlaws: The phone conversation between my husband and my inlaws happened in the other room. He walked into the room I was in and gave me a brief rundown of the dinner plan from across the room,  and I very quietly said \"Who's paying?\" That's it.

Would he feel the same if it was your parents inviting you out and expecting you to pay?", "NTA.\n\nWhat your husband and parents are doing is apparently their dynamic, and if they want to do that, that's fine. But anywhere else, it would have been rude for the inviters to expect the invitees to pay.\n\nAs such, your husband does not get to call you rude, for the following reasons:\n\n1) if it had been anyone else inviting you and then making you pay, it _would_ have been rude\n2) it is his business that he's happy to pay for his parents, but you should have been clued in on this, so you wouldn't have been surprised\n3) one could even argue that since it's your money too, you should have been consulted\n4) all the compromises you suggested were completely valid, and should not have been called rude\n5) your husband calling you rude, then, is a knee-jerk reaction he has to anything threatening his parents' feelings\n\nFind out whether he's a total momma's boy, or just genuinely wants to see his parents happy. Him wanting to treat them is perfectly okay, except that you need to be okay with it too. You guys are married after all.", "Your in-laws changed the dynamic when they broke etiquette rules of slipping the bill to your husband (ie directing him to pay vs accepting an offer) and failing to pick up the bill when they invite.  They made it obvious that they are looking for a free treat vs exploring new places when they started suggesting return visits to places and using you as an excuse for an extravagance that you wouldn\u2019t do.  \n\nI can\u2019t believe they doubled down on the moocher thing and your husband is somehow blaming you.  They are moochers, and they know it.  And they are getting off on flexing their power over you in making you apologize for seeing that they are mooching\u2026while still mooching.\n\nPeople are complicated but I\u2019m guessing they aren\u2019t comfortable that you guys are wealthier than they are and this sort of power play is a free way to put you in your place even if you have more money than them.  \n\nI\u2019d be done going to dinner with them.

Idk how at this juncture of 2023 I still continue to be baffled by people\u2019s entitlement. It really is mindblowing to me. Your husband sounds like he should order the backbone entree at the next dinner.", "NTA - i don\u2019t understand why someone (regardless of their relation to you) would invite YOU somewhere and expect YOU to pay", "NTA... And fuck literally all of that noise. They ARE moochers.", "NTA\n\nAnd there's a reason they think you called them moochers - because they are. My mom always comes to visit twice sometimes 3 times a year and we go out to eat. She pays for everyone every single time. But I also make sure I have enough to cover me and my wife's food at least so I can offer. She turns me down but the one day she can't afford it, I got this", "NTA - They invited you therefore it's on them to pay unless it is previously agreed that you will pay.\n\nThey know what they're doing!

But then they'll use that as an excuse to get another free meal later...", "NTA \n\nIt's lovely that you and your husband treat the parents and in-laws to a free meal at a nice restaurant every 3-4 months, but it sounds like your in-laws are starting to expect to get a free meal at least every month.\n\nYour husband clearly doesn't have a problem with this, but if his parents gets a free meal every month, why not your parents too?\n\nShared finances should have agreement on shared expenses. If you and your husband have separate finances, then he can pay for his parents out of his fun money.", "NTA. \n\nYou stated in your post that because you invite them, y\u2019all always pay. Which is the standard for dining with others. Unless it a double date & each couple pays for themselves. \n\nThe fact your in laws invited y\u2019all out, you expected them to pay. They didn\u2019t even ask or anything but slid the check to your husband to pay as they expected y\u2019all to pay. This happened more than once. There is nothing wrong with your reaction to them wanting to go out to \u2018celebrate your award\u2019. As you took it as them taking y\u2019all out to celebrate but because of their past behavior you wanted clarity on who would pay. It doesn\u2019t even sound like you asked rudely. Just matter of factly. At least, that\u2019s how you made it sound in your post. \n\nYour husband, on the other hand, is making excuses for his parents for acting like moochers.

Especially with their response to celebrate your award. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe them an apology and your husband should be on your side.", "His parents are just rude.  You don't invite someone to dinner and then ask them to pay for it.

Yep.  \nNTA and hubby needs to get on your side.", "NTA. I'm not wealthy and don't have the money to eat out. My parents do. They invite us out and pay for us sometimes, but I would never invite them out and expect them to pay. If they want to invite us out and offer to pay as a gift, I will gladly accept, but to invite them out and force them to pay would be rude as hell. What you said made them feel like moochers because they ARE moochers.", "Do you share finances with your husband?", "NTA - You don't invite someone for dinner and then expect them to pay it in full. Maybe you'd expect them to split it, but definitely not to foot the entire bill. They are moochers... unless your husband has specifically told them not to worry about it in advance.", "NTA. You had your own fun thing going on between you and your husband and your in-laws invaded it and took over. Whereas before you would occasionally invite each set of parents out to join you on a foodie adventure, now you're having to go to restaurants of your in-laws choosing and getting stuck with paying the bill out of obligation. \n\nIt's not a fun thing for you anymore because of them and you're starting to dread their \"invitations.\" \n\nYou don't owe them an apology and you *certainly* don't owe them a night out at a $200-per-person fancy restaurant. That's ludicrous.", "NTA inviting someone out and expecting them to pay is disrespectful.", "Nta- they are taking advantage.  If he's willing to pay with his money, cool. But if you're expected to cover this: play sick & tell them to enjoy their selves. Them being embarrassed is not your fault.", "NTA, your in-laws are mooching off you. They are acting entitled and your husband is enabling them. You should refuse to go to dinner with them.

That\u2019s tacky & rude in my opinion.", "Nta", "NTA If you can't afford to go out, don't go. If you would like to invite them it's  up to you, but you don't have to pay everytime you went out. I would stop going to dinner with them.", "NtA. Why do you have to apologize because you called them out for being moochers? They could at least PRETEND to fight over the check, but to just slide it over? And instead of you inviting them, they invite themselves?  It's all too much.\n\nNtA", "NTA this is absurd to ask anyone out and not foot the bill. They could\u2019ve ask you to tip and they pay. Or split the bill.", "NTA.

I have paid for my parent/step parent when I do the inviting, but it is always after a \u201ctussle\u201d over the bill. If it was their turn, they would win. If it\u2019s my turn I would win. My parent/step-parent earn more than I do, but it\u2019s a nice thing to do for family. If we just expected it, it would no longer be a nice thing and would likely stop.", "WHAT?!   So NTA.

Don't apologies,  I would say your not happy to go out with your in laws until the boundaries are agreed. I would consider separating your finances.

So OP really is the golden goose here and a generous one to boot so the manipulation/guilt tripping/selecting the most expensive things from *his* parents feels even more exploitive.", "NAH, I think this is an issue between you and your husband more than your in-laws. If you can afford it it's not a big deal right. It's odd for them to invite you out and expect you to pay I will agree but it's not a big deal to pay for a meal for your parents which might be where your husband may be coming from.", "It\u2019s fine if you want to invite his parents out sometimes on your dime.

You owe him an apology.\n\nI\u2019m agnostic on the apology to your in-laws. To me, it depends on how comfortable you are financially. If you have plenty of money and everyone knows it, then I\u2019d say YTA for that too. If you\u2019re careful about money and this is messing up your budget, then it\u2019s a complicated situation and everyone should have handled it as such - in-laws, husband, and you - instead of just assuming you\u2019re all on the same page.", "YTA. You should\u2019ve brought this up with your husband when it first bothered you. Instead, you blindsided your husband and his parents.

There are plenty of other ways to spend time together that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.", "Would be great to read an update from you after you chat further.\n\nI can understand feeling protective about one's parents but he can't genuinely think their behaviour of late isn't mooching? Or that you should apologise for accidentally making them feel guilty for something they were guilty of.", "Didn\u2019t say that at all.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that you woke up looking for some argument that doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nHope you have a better day.", "Have you reported his \u201chandyman\u201d business to the city and state??? Some have specific regulations and licenses required.", "How would I find if my city has those?", "Call city hall, the business department, or look online at the city and state websites.", "NTA . You have a husband problem. Your in-laws are freeloaders and your husband enables that behavior.", "NTA\n\nMy experience has been that parents fight to take the bill, even if they're less well off than their adult kids.", "ESH, what's rude is inviting YOU guys out to dinner and having you guys pay for the whole meal, it would be different if it was discussed and not a surprise at the end when the bill gets there, that's not ok, the parents just assumed that every meal is on you, but seeing that their your in-laws and you guys can afford it and they cant, I wouldn't even trip, even if you guys do pay every time you invited them out, it still shouldn't be assumed that will be the case in the opposite situation. Just tell your husband, that they invited you out so you weren't expecting to pick up the bill and if you're going to do this and always pay the tab then it needs to be discussed between the two of you.", "YTA. At some point successful children assume the responsibility to pay for dinners out. You said you could afford it, so why shouldn\u2019t you?", "I always pay when I take out my mom. When she invites me, I offer to pay.  She took care of me and my sibling as a single parent and taking her to dinners and always paying is my way of thanking her for going without so we always had what she needed.  Now that she is retired and on a fixed income, she never has to open her purse when we go out to eat.", "I\u2019ll be in the minority here but I haven\u2019t allowed my parents or in-laws to pay for a meal since the day after my wife and I graduated college (I\u2019m approaching 50).", "YTA. I never expected my parents to pay for a single meal once I was an adult. It was always my treat and a form of respect for all they had done for me. To be stingy with your in laws when you know they can\u2019t afford it makes YTA.", "EHH,\n\nYour parents raised your husband, maybe he doesn\u2019t mind doing something nice for them they would never experience without your help. \n\nAre you the sole breadwinner? Is the entire cost coming out of your wallet? If so I can\u2019t really say YTA, if not and you share finances YTA", "Exactly. Like...if they don't want to feel like moochers, maybe they should stop mooching? Just an idea.", "OP says this is a new thing. It\u2019s perfectly fine to jump on the in-laws but without further information along the spouse names is out of line.", "We\u2019re the same. Husbands children each make close to if not more than double what we make combined, but unless stated before the meal we often offer to pay. Most of the time they refuse. My son makes a little more than us doubled and we switch up who\u2019s paying although he prefers to. My daughter and SIL make over 5xs we do and it gets awkward sometimes. They are terrible at money management and live above their means. They live outside the US so anytime they visit we pay for the meal and if we were to go visit them I would expect them to offer.", "They overheard her whispering, Husband failed to mute the call.", "You\u2019ve chosen to completely ignore who invited who out. You can not reasonably expect someone else to pay for you when you were the kind that invited them. That is ridiculous and entitled.", "in what way are they going to come to the realization on their own?? moochers usually aren\u2019t that self-aware, or if they are, they don\u2019t have a problem with it.", "If they had invited the in-laws, then sure. However, that is not the case. Inviting someone out but expecting them to pay for you is ridiculous. They are moochers.", "Saw something like this at a restaurant on the Thanksgiving (USA) holiday last year. The table next to ours was two older couples. Both of the women had HUMONGOUS purses lined on the inside with plastic bags. The restaurant had setup a buffet for this event. These two women would load up their plates, eat a little, then put fork fulls of food into their bags. Mashed potatoes with gravy, turkey, roast, perch, even the potato salad! My table caught on and couldn't help watching. They were not acting discreet about it, I suspect they didn't care. They were not thrown out and no one said anything to them. They walked out just behind us and one of the bags looked too heavy for the older woman to carry!", "It doesn\u2019t sound like he told his parents; he was still on the phone with them and they overheard OP\u2019s question.\n\nBut everyone knows what\u2019s going on. Non-moochers, and someone who doesn\u2019t enable moochers, don\u2019t react so hostilely to a \u201cwho\u2019s paying?\u201d question. It\u2019s the reaction of the guilty, who don\u2019t want the issue to be acknowledged openly. The husband could have answered that question if he\u2019d wanted to offer to treat.", "Really sounds like an established dynamic that husband pays when dining out with his parents, bc he's better off financially than them. OP reiterates old grudges, so it's not new and more she never communicated her opinions on marital finances. It's a family going out to eat, more of a \"we\" than an invitation, the dynamic is different than friends/acquaintances/strangers.", "Then the spouse should be more supportive and less defensive. I\u2019m not out of line because you disagree. I think hubbs is an ah for attempting to guilt her into paying and dismissing her concerns/frustrations. That\u2019s out of line.", "Wow. 70/30, so really it's your money being used on his parents. How generous of him to graciously accept paying with his wife's money!", "Yeah this is what I was taught and this is what I go by as well, I never thought it was okay unless it was stated at the time of invitation that I could only cover for myself and just wanted to spend time with the person really and other activities would be on the table that didn't cost money like walking on a park trail or something.", "Yeah but there is nothing wrong with paying for your parents when you go out together if you make more than them. Convinced OP would offer to pay if it were her parents, and her issue here is partly the in-laws, not bill.\nESH here, especially given the way she raised her concern, on the phone with them, instead of talking about their approach to spending money on their parents in private with her husband.", "Sounds like hubby loves his mooching parents more than his wife", "Nah, strongly disagree. If this were the case, her husband wouldn\u2019t have looked surprised when they slid that first bill over to him.", "Exactly! It\u2019s the thought that matters more to me than what we eat.  \n\nI make a lot more than my husband.  When we were dating we would take turns paying for dates. On nights I paid we went to nicer places, a steakhouse, an upscale Italian place, a nice seafood place where with appetizer, bottle of wine, 2 entrees, maybe a dessert to share we were at $200-250 not including tip.  When he paid we would go to places like Mexican, a damn good Chinese buffet (seriously it\u2019s still one of my favorite places ever), a local diner, etc.   He always felt really bad he couldn\u2019t afford to take me to the same level of restaurants I took him to.  I told him flat out the fact he cared enough to take me out anywhere meant more to me than where we went.  I just wanted to be with him and some of my favorite dates were when we ordered pizza and watched movies on the couch in our pjs.  I didn\u2019t need fancy I needed that time with him.  \n\nAfter that I scaled back on the places we went unless it was a special occasion mostly to not make him feel uncomfortable.  We got to explore some restaurants we wouldn\u2019t necessarily have tried before like the best Thai place in the world that is located inside a strip mall, same with our favorite Gyro place.  A hibachi grill that looked run down and sketchy on the outside but has the most delicious food ever.  A local mom and pop chicken place that serves nothing but fried chicken, coleslaw, fries and Texas toast with the most delicious dipping sauce you would ever find.  A BBQ place inside a gas station.  We made it a mission to try to find the most obscure places with cheap food and compile a list of the best spots.  We give a copy of that list to anyone we know that recently moved to town now.", "OP doesn't sound like the kind of person that would take kindly to an invitation to IHOP or Denny's", "but who expects that the people you invited to dinner will pay for you?", "I agree but we\u2019re in the minority. OP said this is a relatively new thing in their undisclosed length of marriage. OP also said it surprised her husband and is going to sit down and discuss to see if there\u2019s something going on with IL she may not be aware of. \nHusband and I are about 60/40 with him receiving higher retirement than I do. 70/30 when we first married, but I was the one who followed a plan to get him out of debt. We have joint accounts and there has never been a yours/mine attitude, it\u2019s 100% us.", "I did, thank you very much. It\u2019s not clear if he gave this run down while on the phone or not. My assumption is that he was - why would he pass that along knowing it would be hurtful to his parents?", "The degree to which some people redefine shit as gaslighting is actually closer to gaslighting than the stuff they call gaslighting", "I never said they are obliged too, but that\u2019s the dynamic they\u2019ve set forward. You all care about money too much. If they can afford the bill easily as op says, than it\u2019s petty to complain the parents aren\u2019t paying since she knows they can\u2019t afford the bill.", "Gosh,thank you, and yes I edited the comment...", "This is not about food, but about drinks. I used to go out once a month to a bar with karaoke. We had a little group from our work. We would all take turns buying the round. So this one time, my coworker brought along a friend, so when I bought the round of drinks, i got her one. But then she didn't take her turn buying a round. So next time my coworker brought her, I bought everyone but her a drink.", "Shared money equals shared decision making for money. Husband cannot treat his parents like this without OP agreeing to it which did not happen. ILs expected him to do it and he didn't think to discuss it with OP first. They forced a situation where he had to either do it or start an argument in the restaurant so there was no chance for OP to discuss it before this happened.", ">that\u2019s the dynamic they\u2019ve set forward.\n\nThe dynamic they set forward was initially them inviting the in-laws places, which if you invite someone out to eat, you should expect to pay imo. It didn't start becoming a problem until the in-laws started inviting *them* and expecting *them* to pay.\n\n>You all care about money too much.\n\n*The in-laws* care about money too much, especially money that isn't even theirs to spend. Otherwise, they wouldn't pick more expensive places to go to.\n\n>it\u2019s petty to complain the parents aren\u2019t paying since she knows they can\u2019t afford the bill.\n\nThe whole point is that it's not the in-laws' money. It's like if your parent asks if you want to go shopping at the mall and expexts you to use your card for everything. *You* may not see a problem with it but most people do.", "I literally said that?", "So then suggest they do something other than a fancy restaurant, not badmouth your in-laws via crosstalk while your spouse is bragging to them about you", "Search \"[your state] contractor license search\".  My state allows you to report if they did work or gave you a bid. Check to see if you're able to file in yours based on your knowledge.   And encourage everyone he has scammed to file.\n\nI filed against a shady pool repair guy, together with a few others who were scammed.  They took action on it.  If enough people complain hopefully the guy will go to jail.\n\nNote:  Truth is a defense to defamation.

If you live in the States, he will have to have a license through the state at a minimum, sometimes he'll need a city license as well. There should be a place online where you can check to see if people are licensed by the state.", "WOOF.", "I don\u2019t think it would have ever gotten to that point if OP spoke to her husband the first time it bothered her.", "Because it\u2019s common courtesy???", "because people have common courtesy and know that you don\u2019t assume someone else will pay for your meal ESPECIALLY when you\u2019re the one who invited them ?????"]}
