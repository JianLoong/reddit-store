We have a lifestyle that allows us to eat out whenever we like, and live in an area with lots of good food and unique resturants. We also like to share our favorites, and so recently have begun inviting either my parents or his parents out with us. We take them out maybe once every 3-4 months (not including celebrations), and because we invite, we always pay. This isn't the only time we see our parents. \n\nA few months ago, my in laws invited us out to a resturant they liked near their house. We hadn't ever been, and even though it wasn't a place we normally would have chosen, we figured it was their way of \"joining the fun\" and showing us something new like we had shown them. After dinner, my MIL slid the bill over to my husband without looking at it. He looked surprised, but dinner wasn't expensive, so we paid it without saying anything. A few weeks later, my in laws invited us out again, to a moderately expensive place we had taken them once before, and did the same thing. \n\nRecently, while on a call with his Mom, my husband mentioned that I had gotten an award at work.  His mother immediately suggested we all go out to a very fancy resturant nearby to celebrate. I quietly asked if we were going to have to pay for it, and my husband stated glaring daggers at me. He ended the call quickly, and called me rude. I told him I didn't think we should have to pay every time his parents wanted to go to dinner, and that they were using my award (which really wasn't a big deal at all) to get a fancy night out. He said we could afford it and they couldn't (this is true), and I was an asshole for refusing to pay for them. Later, after he had spoken to his dad, he told me I had embarrassed his parents and made them feel like moochers. They want an apology, and to make up for it, he said we should just take them out to the fancy resturant they want. No pretense of celebrating my award this time. \n\nAITA? I don't feel like it's wrong to expect not to pay when you're invited out.\n\nBecause I know someone will ask: yes, in an attempt to resolve the fight with my husband, I suggested holding off on fancy resturant until their anniversary at the end of summer. They want to go now. Also,  splitting the bill is apparently not an option and suggesting that was rude, too.\n\nEDIT: Because MANY people do not understand that I did not attack my inlaws: The phone conversation between my husband and my inlaws happened in the other room. He walked into the room I was in and gave me a brief rundown of the dinner plan from across the room,  and I very quietly said \"Who's paying?\" That's it.

Would he feel the same if it was your parents inviting you out and expecting you to pay?", "NTA.\n\nWhat your husband and parents are doing is apparently their dynamic, and if they want to do that, that's fine. But anywhere else, it would have been rude for the inviters to expect the invitees to pay.\n\nAs such, your husband does not get to call you rude, for the following reasons:\n\n1) if it had been anyone else inviting you and then making you pay, it _would_ have been rude\n2) it is his business that he's happy to pay for his parents, but you should have been clued in on this, so you wouldn't have been surprised\n3) one could even argue that since it's your money too, you should have been consulted\n4) all the compromises you suggested were completely valid, and should not have been called rude\n5) your husband calling you rude, then, is a knee-jerk reaction he has to anything threatening his parents' feelings\n\nFind out whether he's a total momma's boy, or just genuinely wants to see his parents happy. Him wanting to treat them is perfectly okay, except that you need to be okay with it too. You guys are married after all.", "Your in-laws changed the dynamic when they broke etiquette rules of slipping the bill to your husband (ie directing him to pay vs accepting an offer) and failing to pick up the bill when they invite.  They made it obvious that they are looking for a free treat vs exploring new places when they started suggesting return visits to places and using you as an excuse for an extravagance that you wouldn\u2019t do.  \n\nI can\u2019t believe they doubled down on the moocher thing and your husband is somehow blaming you.  They are moochers, and they know it.  And they are getting off on flexing their power over you in making you apologize for seeing that they are mooching\u2026while still mooching.\n\nPeople are complicated but I\u2019m guessing they aren\u2019t comfortable that you guys are wealthier than they are and this sort of power play is a free way to put you in your place even if you have more money than them.  \n\nI\u2019d be done going to dinner with them.

Idk how at this juncture of 2023 I still continue to be baffled by people\u2019s entitlement. It really is mindblowing to me. Your husband sounds like he should order the backbone entree at the next dinner.", "NTA - i don\u2019t understand why someone (regardless of their relation to you) would invite YOU somewhere and expect YOU to pay", "NTA... And fuck literally all of that noise. They ARE moochers.", "NTA\n\nAnd there's a reason they think you called them moochers - because they are. My mom always comes to visit twice sometimes 3 times a year and we go out to eat. She pays for everyone every single time. But I also make sure I have enough to cover me and my wife's food at least so I can offer. She turns me down but the one day she can't afford it, I got this", "NTA - They invited you therefore it's on them to pay unless it is previously agreed that you will pay.\n\nThey know what they're doing!

But then they'll use that as an excuse to get another free meal later...", "NTA \n\nIt's lovely that you and your husband treat the parents and in-laws to a free meal at a nice restaurant every 3-4 months, but it sounds like your in-laws are starting to expect to get a free meal at least every month.\n\nYour husband clearly doesn't have a problem with this, but if his parents gets a free meal every month, why not your parents too?\n\nShared finances should have agreement on shared expenses. If you and your husband have separate finances, then he can pay for his parents out of his fun money.", "NTA. \n\nYou stated in your post that because you invite them, y\u2019all always pay. Which is the standard for dining with others. Unless it a double date & each couple pays for themselves. \n\nThe fact your in laws invited y\u2019all out, you expected them to pay. They didn\u2019t even ask or anything but slid the check to your husband to pay as they expected y\u2019all to pay. This happened more than once. There is nothing wrong with your reaction to them wanting to go out to \u2018celebrate your award\u2019. As you took it as them taking y\u2019all out to celebrate but because of their past behavior you wanted clarity on who would pay. It doesn\u2019t even sound like you asked rudely. Just matter of factly. At least, that\u2019s how you made it sound in your post. \n\nYour husband, on the other hand, is making excuses for his parents for acting like moochers.

Especially with their response to celebrate your award. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe them an apology and your husband should be on your side.", "His parents are just rude.  You don't invite someone to dinner and then ask them to pay for it.

Yep.  \nNTA and hubby needs to get on your side.", "NTA. I'm not wealthy and don't have the money to eat out. My parents do. They invite us out and pay for us sometimes, but I would never invite them out and expect them to pay. If they want to invite us out and offer to pay as a gift, I will gladly accept, but to invite them out and force them to pay would be rude as hell. What you said made them feel like moochers because they ARE moochers.", "Do you share finances with your husband?", "NTA - You don't invite someone for dinner and then expect them to pay it in full. Maybe you'd expect them to split it, but definitely not to foot the entire bill. They are moochers... unless your husband has specifically told them not to worry about it in advance.", "NTA. You had your own fun thing going on between you and your husband and your in-laws invaded it and took over. Whereas before you would occasionally invite each set of parents out to join you on a foodie adventure, now you're having to go to restaurants of your in-laws choosing and getting stuck with paying the bill out of obligation. \n\nIt's not a fun thing for you anymore because of them and you're starting to dread their \"invitations.\" \n\nYou don't owe them an apology and you *certainly* don't owe them a night out at a $200-per-person fancy restaurant. That's ludicrous.", "NTA inviting someone out and expecting them to pay is disrespectful.", "Nta- they are taking advantage.  If he's willing to pay with his money, cool. But if you're expected to cover this: play sick & tell them to enjoy their selves. Them being embarrassed is not your fault.", "NTA, your in-laws are mooching off you. They are acting entitled and your husband is enabling them. You should refuse to go to dinner with them.

I would stop going to dinner with them.", "NtA. Why do you have to apologize because you called them out for being moochers? They could at least PRETEND to fight over the check, but to just slide it over? And instead of you inviting them, they invite themselves?  It's all too much.\n\nNtA", "NTA this is absurd to ask anyone out and not foot the bill. They could\u2019ve ask you to tip and they pay. Or split the bill.", "NTA.

I have paid for my parent/step parent when I do the inviting, but it is always after a \u201ctussle\u201d over the bill. If it was their turn, they would win. If it\u2019s my turn I would win. My parent/step-parent earn more than I do, but it\u2019s a nice thing to do for family. If we just expected it, it would no longer be a nice thing and would likely stop.", "WHAT?!   So NTA.

Don't apologies,  I would say your not happy to go out with your in laws until the boundaries are agreed. I would consider separating your finances.

So OP really is the golden goose here and a generous one to boot so the manipulation/guilt tripping/selecting the most expensive things from *his* parents feels even more exploitive.", "NAH, I think this is an issue between you and your husband more than your in-laws. If you can afford it it's not a big deal right. It's odd for them to invite you out and expect you to pay I will agree but it's not a big deal to pay for a meal for your parents which might be where your husband may be coming from.", "It\u2019s fine if you want to invite his parents out sometimes on your dime.

You owe him an apology.\n\nI\u2019m agnostic on the apology to your in-laws. To me, it depends on how comfortable you are financially. If you have plenty of money and everyone knows it, then I\u2019d say YTA for that too. If you\u2019re careful about money and this is messing up your budget, then it\u2019s a complicated situation and everyone should have handled it as such - in-laws, husband, and you - instead of just assuming you\u2019re all on the same page.", "YTA. You should\u2019ve brought this up with your husband when it first bothered you. Instead, you blindsided your husband and his parents.

Then go out only when they invite you. Your husband doesn't have your back about who's paying. You lose that battle.", "NTA. They feel like moochers because... they're mooching....", "NTA - you earn more than your husband don\u2019t you? How much of this \u201cwe have a lifestyle that allows us to\u2026\u201d is down to you? I\u2019m guessing and I could be way off but I\u2019m thinking this is a key part of it.\nAlso how were his parents embarrassed unless he told them what you said privately to him?", "NTA \n\nIf you can't afford dinner at a nice restaurant, you just don't invite others and make them pay. I can understand paying half, but expecting you always to pay is wrong. Even more if it's an expensive place ! \n\nYour husband can pay if he really wants, but this is setting a precedent, and it's going to go wrong in the future.", "NTA. Tell your husband he's free to treat his parents whenever he wants but keep your finances out of it. Special occasions is understandable but aside from that, a hard no. You need to start boundaries while it's still early. If you cave in, you'll be doing that for the rest of your marriage.", "You did not make them feel like moochers. They feel like moochers because they ARE moochers. Just because your husband is ok with that doesn't make them any less moochers. NTA", "NTA , why is your husband okay with them being moochers?", "They feel like moochers because that's what they are. And having been called out on it they want to mooch some more by getting a free meal by way of apology. If they are inviting you out they should have the decency to discuss who is paying in advance if they aren't planning to do so. Their behaviour is very rude.

If they actually felt bad they would stay in their financial lane and take you two to what they can afford and foot the damn bill.\n\nYour husband needs to apologize to you and until he does you should refuse eating out with them. It\u2019s your money too not just his!\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nYou only pay if you invite them. They pay if they invite you. Basic common sense. However I am concerned about how long they have manipulated your husband. The sheer fact he\u2019s willing to shell out $1,000 for his parents without asking you is .. interesting, and than gaslighting you and telling you are in the wrong is weird. and yes I am concerned about that. It tells me his parents are more important than his life partner. Are they more important than his future children? What happens when you butt heads with mommy and daddy? What happens when your husband moves his parents in your house? Are you supposed to smile and wait on them hand and foot?? I personally would think about the future very seriously and have a very important discussion with my husband.", "Haha NTA they're definitely mooching off of you. Tell your husband he can go next time they \"invite\" you out. Do NOT apologize your husband needs to get it together and apologize to you for not having your back", "nta", "NTA They are moochers. One does not invite others out and expect the others to pay. At least if one has any manners at all. His parents apparently don't. You are not their on call wallets for a night out instead of casserole.", "NTA. They were totally testing the waters with that first inexpensive dinner. Realized you and hubby would pay with no fight, so thought they could get away with it again at a slightly more expensive place, and they did! So now they want an expensive restaurant because they know they won't have to pay. If you go and don't set boundaries down now, they will keep mooching off you and your hubby at expensive places from now on. I would suggest going to a place where they can pay for their half of the bill, but I doubt that will go over well.", "This is a total move my grandparents would have used. They were infamous in our family for not only being moochers to others, but also tried to test the will of restaurants/managers to be cheap. \n\nThey weren't allowed into any buffet in their town because my grandma \"wasn't hungry\" when they arrived but ended up eating entire meals off of my Grandpa's plate. Other restaurants they would be refused service because they simply tried too many times to get comped for something burned or for another imaginary excuse to save a few bucks.\n\nWhen they found out my Mom had paid off my Dad's debts before they got married, they tried pushing the restaurant bill on her. She nipped it in the bud very early, but I think that was part of the reason they never liked her - nobody **ever** had dared to call them out under the guise of \"keeping the peace\" and she created a boundary against them for once.", "[removed]", "Hell to the nah!

Imagine\n\n\"You think I'm only here for money? You've offended me. To make up for my hurt feelings, give me money\"", "So my parents do invite us out, and they do pay, with the exception of alcohol. The alcohol was something established years ago and is a known deal.", "The \"wants to see his parents happy\" angle is probably the truest. OP said his parents probably couldn't afford the bill. Maybe hubby feels a debt? of some kind to his parents for his present circumstances? All well and good but OP doesnt need to apologize, hubby needs to calm down and they need to talk this out.", "Leeches NTA", "Honestly, when I asked, I didn't even realize they could hear me.", "Yes. Joint everything.", "Splitting the bill definitely would have been an acceptable option. Honestly, if they'd have just said, \"Hey, I know you've been to X place, and it looks good, could we maybe try it sometime?\", I probably would have found a reason to go there and invited them. I just don't feel like I should be sorry for not wanting to be the unknowing ticket to a free dinner all the time.", "They have paid before, but not in this context.  Income is about 70/30, I make more. He had NOT offered to pay before hand, and was surprised.", "So for reference, the fancy place is almost $200 a person. We don't even go there unless we're celebrating something big. And I guess I'd feel less annoyed if it was all in the spirit of how this started - sharing our favorites with people who'd never been. That why I wasn't worried about the first one. But the escalation in price, along with the fact that these are not new places, kind of makes me feel like an ATM rather than a dinner partner.", "Just because they can afford to cover the bill doesn\u2019t mean they should be expect to be invited to places and then pay the bill. It\u2019s like someone throwing you a surprise party and then going here\u2019s all the bills. It\u2019s not okay it\u2019s massively disrespectful.", "I'm seriously confused on why everyone thinks I called them out to their face.", "To clarify, they can definately afford dinners. They are not as well off as we are, but they are not struggling. He said they cannot afford the $200 per person fancy resturant.", "According to OP, the restaurant they're demanding to be taken to costs $200 per person on average. That's almost a *thousand bucks* for a single night out that they are pushing their son to cough up just to appease them.\n\nOP's husband needs to learn boundaries and the word *no,* and he needs to learn it fast. His parents are being very manipulative and entitled here, and I wouldn't be surprised if they have done this sort of thing to him throughout his entire life. Yes, their son is kind and caring, but they are using it against him and taking advantage of him.", "Again, had no clue they could hear me in the privacy of my own home.", "No, I did not. He was in the other room discussing it,  came to the room I was in and gave me a quick rundown of the plan. I very quietly said \"who's paying for it?\", not realizing they could hear me.

Please try reading the post again.", "No one attacked anyone, and definitely not in public. I'm 100% ready to admit I'm TA of that's the case,  but I would prefer it be based on facts.", "OP said in a different comment that husband wouldn't be able to afford it without OP money, so he DID expected OP to pay for them.", "Lol. How did OP attack them?  How was it public? Are you just throwing in made-up narrative to bolster your bad judgment?", "NTA and her saying something didn't \"make them\" feel like moochers, THEIR OWN BEHAVIOR did that quite well thankyouverymuch.

You're definitely NTA.", "I\u2019m still a bit hung up on the \u201cwho\u2019s paying\u201d comment.

Joking aside is there any culture where you invite someone out for a meal and expect them to pay.", "That's pricey, i guess you have to get your husband to talk to your parents as to why they are doing this without any prior communication", "They aren't dinner partners, they are his parents. Parent dynamics can have different expectations than literally any other relationship. \n\nFor example, my inlaws are massively loaded compared to my husband and I. The first few times we went out to eat, they paid, no questions asked. We were living in literal poverty at the time and dinner cost as much as my husband's part time paycheck. Now, years later, no matter who suggests getting together, we all understand they will pay. My MIL has the attitude of \"we can't take it with us, and we want to treat our loved ones while we are alive to enjoy it with them\". I offered a few times in the beginning, but they wouldn't hear it. I wouldn't consider us moochers, it's just our arrangement. \n\nMy mom, by contrast, makes about $900 a month. Whether she wants to get together or we invite her, we pay. No questions asked. Either my brother or I just grab the bill. She sometimes wants to go to a particular restaurant or try something new, and she will ask us to go there, but it is never assumed she would pay. She's my mom. I'll cover her every time. \n\nWith my brother, my friends, my cousins, my colleagues, my acquaintances, my dates when I was dating, anyone else, I assume separate checks unless the inviter specifically said they were paying. But the invitee would not be expected to pay for everyone. With anyone else but parents. \n\nI'm NOT saying that my situation is your situation or that it should be. All I'm saying is that with parents, sometimes the dynamics are different. So husband and parents are AH for having a different relationship or expectations than you have. \n\nNAH. Just different parent dynamics. Husband needs to clear it up with you and get you both on the same page. Then he needs to clear it up with his parents. If you would only be comfortable with the inviter paying for everyone, he needs to lay that out for his parents going forward. With both of you as a united front. If you would be comfortable with the unspoken understanding that you guys would cover the bill every time, that would be the expectation going forward. And it would be ok to say something like \"I appreciate the thought, but Fancypants Restaurant is out of our budget right now. How about Less Fancy Alternative?\" Then they can offer to pay or split if they really want to go to Fancypants.", "I agree but because it's not a random couple it's your parents it's a little bit tricky. They tend to have some sort of thought/justification process that they won't communicate hence the husband should talk to them in my view.", "Are you saying they didn\u2019t hear your comment, and they\u2019re embarrassed because your husband told them what you said? Or did they hear you quietly ask your husband who\u2019d be paying?", "So you will be on the hook for a $1k dinner (four people plus tip) that they want? That is so uncool!", "Should have clarified that I think they were wrong to not pay those times they invited you both out. Saying that long term that this is not worth fighting about. Consider it a quirk and treat accordingly, do not go out with them if you do not want to pay. This can potentially do long term damage", "No her husband said they should take them out to expensive restaurant as apology for making them feel bad. She is NTA for expecting them to pay when they planned the dinner out. Merely pointing out that not worth the drama the not paying stance will take on relationship. The couple can afford, treat the parents and control situation by not accepting invitation they do not feel comfortable paying.

The issue isn't necessarily paying for them, I have no problem continuing to take them out every once in a while,  it's the expectation that we will just pay every time they want. They can and do go out on their own, sometimes to places we've shown them.", "Yeah,  I didn't realize they could hear me,  but we are probably going to have to make a \"hang up the phone before discussing plans\" rule in the future.", "I had no idea that they could hear me. My husband and the phone he was on was across the room when I asked. And it's not like I was yelling. I would NEVER have brought that conversation up with them without talking to him first, and probably would have let him handle it with them if we had talked about it.", "You should definitely consider a joint account for household expenses and separate ones for personal expenses.  Y'all need marriage counseling too.  He's demanding you apologize and take his parents put to dinner for THEIR rudeness.  The audacity of your husband and his parents....op are there other issues with your husband?", "if husband does want to pay for his parents, it's about time to separate finances. he pays for his parents, you for your parents. \n\nnow food, what would be next? \n\nthe way they reacted shows entitlement and your husband is enabling them.", "Exactly. It's the audacity. The foodacity.", "Ok, that is completely unacceptable. They are freeloading off of you!", ">  it's the expectation that we will just pay every time they want.\n\nNo, the big problem is that they issue the invite, but still expect you to pay!", "The fact that he can\u2019t afford it without you is kind of a big red flag. He\u2019s inherited the moocher gene most likely.", "So he wants YOU to pay his parents fancy dinner because neither them not him can afford it without your money... NTA but OP you need a joint account for shared expenses and a separate account for personal expenses (and emergencies) ASAP. \nNot only his parents but he's also mooching you, and your husband is a huge A-H for downplaying your feelings about being used.", "Not really, not outside of normal couple stuff. This was short of a surprise. This happened Thursday, and it's not like we've been at each other's throats. I'm going to chat with him this evening and see if there something I don't know, and if we can compromise somewhere. I don't know that we're to separate finances and marriage counseling quite yet.", "I am glad to hear this is a one off.  Your husband's attitude and demanding you apologize is really weird and I can understand keeping joint finances since this is the only issue.  Definitely sit down and have a long talk with him.  $800 for a single night at a restaurant every month is ridiculous.", "So you\u2019re just going to let this get worse and cause resentment? Are there other things your husband likes to do that he couldn\u2019t afford without you?", ">. I don't know that we're to separate finances\n\nI was told by quite a few women (almost everyone i knew before moving in with my now hubby) to keep my own money. From day 1 hubby and I have had our own bank accounts we split household bills by what we can afford- hubby has the big ones cause he works, I cover the insurances and anything kid related as well as my own bills because I'm a SAHM on government income. Our joint account is solely for passing money between us easily.\n\nIt sounds like on top of your hubby's insistence on spoiling his parents he also has an attitude about your money is his money and his money is his money since he seems quite happy paying for his parents without even mentioning it to you first. \n\nI think you are long overdue for the separate bank accounts and the only way to resolve any of this is going to be through counselling so you can have a mediator to stop him from shutting you down and refusing to reach a compromise.", "Nope. See comment about taking about it."]}
