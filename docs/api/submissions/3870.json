Tell him you\u2019re sorry about what you said regarding superiority in name choice, you know you\u2019re both equal parents. You also need to tell him in no uncertain terms that the baby\u2019s name is to be chosen between the parents, NOT his mother. Tell him you found that name matching app that shows couples names they both agreed on, and that you have full faith you\u2019ll find a name you both love. Maybe some assurance that you can both agree on your daughter\u2019s name might de-stress the situation. All in all, I really hope you two decide on a name you adore for your girl. I hope to see a positive update in R/BestofRedditorUpdates.", "OP I absolutely loved the name Lily, still do, but my kids Dad didn\u2019t so I had to let it go. I completely get becoming attached to a name and really wanting it but it really is something you need to compromise on.  This just isn\u2019t the hill to die on. There are so many beautiful names and maybe you can make it a fun thing. You two get a name book and start going through it together and make a list of the ones you both like and go from there.", "especially love your username with this comment lol", "Octavia Spencer came to my mind!", "Literally not what happened. BOTH agreed that OPs last name is both unflattering and hard to say. OP chose the last name. The last name was a mutual decision and so should the first name.", "Look at OPs comments. They BOTH chose the surname. OP even said her surname was hard to pronounce and unflattering. That\u2019s why you got downvoted earlier. OP is pregnant for 9 months, which was known when this started. They will both be parents for 18+ years. They should get equal say in the name.", "Oh my goodness, how do you get Ak- out of that?\n\nI would presume Oct- like, October?", "Only if the last name is Funke.", "I know two kids named Maverick, it\u2019s in the top 100.", "Side effects may include lowered resistance to bullying.", "But Spike IS a nickname! His real name is William.", "He's the asshole as well for bringing his mother in to it.", "My mom gave me my name on a whim and it unfortunately ended up popular as hell. Could have named me after any fashion house and I got named after the biography playing in her room because she was sure I was going to be a boy until they announced me. (Same happened to my older brother. He was almost Tiffany)\n\nThat said I once taught a year of kids when 6 of them picked Leo as their English name. I ended up telling them apart with specific nicknames (e.g. Taekwondo Leo, Musical Leo, Track Star Leo) Really funny when my boss pulled me aside one day to ask what \u201cLeo with the drip\u201d meant (kid showed up in the dead of winter in a full Nike tech and holographic slides)", "I have a question. Why are you set on naming your child a feminine version of the number 8?", "Umm no", "You mean, if she gets cut open and the baby is ripped from her womb? Yeah pretty sure that counts too", "Oof I'm kind of worried about this in the future. My whole family has middle names, quite unusual ones, but I love it. The man i love and hope to marry however thinks middle names are weird \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 in all fairness i have warned him that my kids will have middle names, no question \ud83d\ude02", "Octavia is a reference to a Roman emperor (Octavian).", "I was just wondering because you specifically said pushing it out of their vag and there are other ways to birth a child.", "Octavian is actually a kickass name and the only good joke is accidentally calling you Augustus.\n\nThat and reminding people of the golden rule of Rome \u201cDon\u2019t fuck with Octavian\u201d", "My mother was so sure I was going to be a boy that she didn't have a girl's name picked out. However, at one point she jokingly told my grandmother that if I WAS a girl, I should be named after my grandmothers since my brother was named after our grandfathers. That would have given me the name Muriel Eula. My grandmother threatened to disown Mom if she did any such thing!", "Me too! And then I also thought of \u0160koda Octavia, which is a car lol", "Which still means 'the eighth'. Octavia is just a feminine version.", "Another Redditor called her adopted twin sisters \u201cthe Beans.\u201d I thought it was adorable.", "Thanks lol. The only time I've been called Augustus is by my friend that was super into ancient history.", "Isn't Octavian generally a boy's name, and Octavia a girl's name?", "So? Tons of names have meanings, but no one cares about those meanings when naming a kid. For example, someone naming their kid, \u201cCecilia,\u201d isn\u2019t planning on naming their kid \u201cblind\u201d and someone naming their kid, \u201cDavid,\u201d isn\u2019t referencing the word \u201cbeloved.\u201d\n\nYou didn\u2019t already know that?", "My eldest called my youngest \"Lolo\" before she was born. At one point my husband and I were so tired of talking about names(baby #3 so we were out of ideas) we had a brief moment of insanity where we considered making that baby's middle name because we couldn't think of anything. We went with Bowie for the middle name because I love his music and he died while I was pregnant. We figured nobody ever uses middle names. \n\nI now have a 6yo girl who insists on going by Bowie. Whoops.", "Yes I'm a boy but the name is similar enough that it won't matter much to kids.", "Lmao until someone is old enough to go through tweenager embarrassment\u2026 then it\u2019ll be a sibling blackmail bomb", "My bf called mine Little Duck for the longest time.  His nickname is still Little Duck.  He loves it.  All because when I found out I was pregnant, I chucked tiny ducks at my bf to tell him they grew into big ducks.  Took him a sec before he got it, but it was a fun story to his nickname.", "Our daughter was Jelly Bean because that's what she looked like in the first ultrasound."]}
