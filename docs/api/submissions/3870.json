That's news to me.  And it certainly isn't a modern name.  I know two Mikaylas, one 60 and one 35. (Both male)", "We\u2019re both white. I just don\u2019t like the name. I brought up the compromise with Lilly or Ruby but he didn\u2019t like those. But what I\u2019m getting from the comments is that we\u2019re both going to have to compromise a little bit on the name.", "P.s. Octavia Mikayla or Mikayla Octavia both sound really good if you were to use one as a middle name.", "Ok but we aren't here to judge legality", "That's going to REALLY depend on OP's jurisdiction - where I am, both parents must agree on the name (at least in theory).", "I don't think legality is really the issue here.", "What law is that?", "I agree with everything you said but just to defend the name Octavia, I think it\u2019s a beautiful name with a rich history and has a very powerful sound to it. Although I have already accepted it won\u2019t be my daughters name due to this post.", "I never thought of it like that but you\u2019re absolutely right. I definitely don\u2019t want my child to suffer over something as trivial as a name. Based on the comments it\u2019s clear that we both have to keep looking and axe mikayla and octavia all together.", "This!! My mom and dad didn\u2019t agree on my name and my mom hates it and I honestly hate it bc they didn\u2019t agree in it. But my mom had complications following my birth and my dad filled out the birth certificate stuff.\nMy mom still makes comments on how mad it made her!", "My mum wanted me to have only first name and my father added a middle name behind her back, she was bitter about this years after they divorced", "Yeah, I assume your mutual combativeness isn't helping.", "Keep going through names together, hopefully you'll agree on the perfect name. Really, a baby name should have approval of both parents. It's a 2 yes, 1 no situation!", "Otto Otavius is a Spider-man villain but that's the only thing I really know off the top of my head since it sounds similar.", "That's not necessarily true. While that is the common way it works in the US, there are plenty of exceptions both in and outside of the US (some places it's actually common for the wife's surname to be used after marriage/for children) to children having the father's surname. \n\nAnd since they are not married, assuming they are in the US, they will likely have extra paperwork to do if they choose to give baby dad's surname.", "Did I miss the part that said baby will have dads last name? Isnt that uncommon especially if not married for kids to have moms last name or Hyphened with both. \n\nThat is an option unless OP/BF plan to get married and go with one's last name or Hyphen.\n\nOne parent picks first name, other gets to decide the last name.   Rock-paper-scissors for who gets to first pick.", "Yeah, and he didn't like the suggestions. Which is pretty common. It can be a long process to find a name both people like, or at least are OK with. So now she's clearly considering saying \"F it\". She (and he) need to keep trying.", "First, if she is filling out the birth certificate, she can literally put whatever name she wants. That's her \\*right\\*, legally. The question, however, is not what is her legal right in this matter, but what might or might not make her an asshole. \n\nAssuming (as seems to be the case here) that the father wants to be involved in this kid's life, the kid's name should be a mutual decision.", "It just stood the test of time really well. My name is like that, ironically it also has a roman origin, and my grandfather's sister shared it (and so did one national hero from XIX century)", "Right? She was a Roman goddess. You can't get much more old-fashioned.", "It\u2019s a European make of car. When I heard the name it was the first thing I thought of.\n\n[Skoda Octavia](https://flic.kr/p/FeQ3tG)", "Sorry, I misread that paragraph. You are both going to have to either find a compromise or some third name that suits you both.", "Ogberfell", "I know exactly who Octavia is, where the name comes from and its history. \n\nPerhaps a name from an ancestral family member? A matriarch that's well respected.", "Or mash it up: miktavia \ud83e\udd23 seriously, if you want a good coparenting situation from the start, one no two yes is a helpful rule.", "There\u2019s a cool app that works like tinder for baby names, you guys should each get it and see if you end up with any in common.", "It\u2019s lovely how a father wanting his kids to have his surname is not a \u201c2 yes 1 no\u201d decision but anytime the mom wants a veto on the first name Reddit goes ballistic", "Maybe, \"Ooga Ooga\", the stone wielding cave woman that liked to fingerpaint with blueberries mixed with honey?", "Question then: is this a joke because I have never heard of this car not its reputation nor would I know make that assumption.", "I love you just for \u201cMiktavia\u201d alone. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Or Okayla, she'll probably hate you for that", "In our group of friends, we all used silly names for our unborn babies instead of sharing the real names we\u2019d picked, which stayed secret until the baby was born because none of us felt the need to hear any opinions on our chosen names. We gave the ridiculous names with a serious look if anyone asked us what the baby would be called, and the looks were fantastic. Some of the nicknames were Pepe, Cachumo, and Goomba. Miktavia seems like it would be a brilliant one to use as a placeholder, too!", "All I can think of is \"Activia\" yoghurt.", "No, very few if anyone is criticizing this woman for \\*vetoing\\* a name. They are saying she WBTA if she named the kid without any consideration given to the father's feelings. There's a big difference there. \n\nAs for last names, same thing applies. Is it custom/default in most societies for the dad's last name = kid's last name? Absolutely. Is it the case that this should happen without any conversation between the two parents? Absolutely not.", "Aren\u2019t most names old fashioned anyways? Octavia is old, yes, but it has a charming vibe.", "My parents did that. My comic placeholder name was \"Ermintrude\" after a character in the Magic Roundabout!", "Usually the couple can pick who's last name the baby will have and what name they want to keep after they get married. For example one of my aunts chose to get her and her husband's names hyphenated and my bf claims if we were to get married he'd like to take my surname because he doesn't like having a really common one (think one of the most popular ones in the country vs about 200 uses). And let's not even get started on hispanic cultures", "They seem to go in waves. Although many names are derivatives/variations of older names. I always enjoyed looking up name histories."]}
