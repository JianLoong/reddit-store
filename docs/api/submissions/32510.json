Everything was just downright perfect and beautiful, except for one tiny detail.\n\nMy ex from when I was 21 was my dad\u2019s best friend\u2019s son, we will call him \u201cMax\u201d. Max and I were friends for 8 years and dated for 3. We broke up shortly after my birthday after he cheated on me with some girl from his college. I only found out when I visited him. He went on a rampage(ok exaggeration) but you get the point, and started saying that he was in LOVE with this girl and that he felt that I was manipulative. \n\nMind you this was also shortly after my miscarriage, I was pregnant and Max ignored any of my calls or texts for 2 weeks and didn\u2019t even bother to show up at the hospital even after his sister informed him. He was pretty emotionally abusive which I only realised after I met my husband \u201cDennis\u201d.\n\nI am still close to the family of my dad\u2019s best friend because they have been nothing but kind to me even though their son is a b***h. His mother always hyped me up when we were dating and even after we broke up. So I wanted them to be there, I asked my dad if it\u2019ll be rude to leave out my ex from the invite that was going to the family as a whole. My dad said it wouldn\u2019t be rude but might come off as a little petty. Dennis didn\u2019t see a problem with Max coming so he asked me to just invite the whole family +2 in case my ex and his brother wanted to bring someone along. (His sister has her medical exams so she already informed that she wouldn\u2019t be able to participate)\n\nI sent the invite and a week later they sent their RSVP. But I started to panic when I saw the name of the girl he cheated on me with as his +1. It came as a shock because his mom told me that Max and this girl had broken up soon after college ended. I was hyperventilating because somewhere it still hurts, he was the first guy I got really emotionally involved with and have only ever been with him and Dennis.\nI called my mom and dad and they asked me to just uninvite Max if his presence will ruin my big day and they\u2019re sure his best friend\u2019s family would understand. \n\nI called up Max\u2019s mom and explained to her how it was affecting me and she said that she\u2019s doubtful it is possible since he still claims that he is no longer with that girl (she looks exactly like her, I could spot her even in a whole crowd), but she understands and would talk to Max but thinks it is unfair to uninvite over something that happened over 7 years ago, I said \u201cokay\u201d and then proceeded to uninvite all of them over text.\nMy parents and brother think that I shouldn\u2019t have uninvited all of them and what I did was rude and petty. Max\u2019s mother and my dad\u2019s best friend are also upset about my decision but they say that they understand and still sent me a wedding gift. Some of the people in my dad\u2019s circle are calling me and Dennis aholes and petty for not having the people who have only shown me kindness and loved me like one of their own.\nMy best friend told me that I should just put it on reddit if I am still in two minds about what I did, so here I am.

No one else.", "NTA - it\u2019s your wedding and I get your ex is their family, but if they can\u2019t understand why your ex shouldn\u2019t be invited, they are the problem. \n\nCheating should never be tolerated. It\u2019s your special day and if they are making it unbearable, it\u2019s fine to uninvited them. I would say maybe have a convo with them since you are close and truly explain how this is making you feel with no sugar coating. But, if they still \u201cdon\u2019t understand\u201d 100% uninvited them.", "But... why did you uninvite them? I get the ex, but why did you pull the trigger on the whole family?", "Max\u2019s mom told you she understood, but then said she thought it was \u201cunfair\u201d to uninvite him. So she obviously did NOT understand that her son cheating on you & on top of it bringing the girl he cheated with was wrong. No wonder you disinvited them. NTA. \n\nWho tells a bride it\u2019s \u201cunfair\u201d to not want the guy that cheated on you at your wedding?? And with the girl he cheated with?? If it was their daughter, you can bet she would feel differently. \n\nThey may be kind and love you, but regarding your wedding she definitely didn\u2019t love you like her own.\n\nSo disrespectful that people in your dad\u2019s circle are gossiping about it (middle school behavior), especially when the core reason Max\u2019s family was disinvited they probably don\u2019t even know. \n\nCongrats on your marriage, it sounds like you ended up with the right guy!", "NTA. What you did was awkward. But would have been better than to endure the painful ex and his cheater gf at your wedding. And max\u2019s mom supported him by saying they you shouldn\u2019t uninvite him for something that happened 7 yrs ago. He cheated on you and didn\u2019t visit you in the hospital during a miscarriage with his baby ? That\u2019s not a small thing to forgive even after 7 yrs. His mom thinks he deserves to show up at your wedding , then she wasn\u2019t that supportive of you in the first place.", "This is a tough one, but ESH - you more than everybody else. You made the initial mistake of inviting Max despite your inner turmoil on this. You let you parents and fiance talk you into this (that is their AH part) despite your misgivings. And you could have invited everyone in the family but him by specifying that on the invite. It would have been petty, but understandable. But since you invited him, you cannot police who he is going to bring as a plus one. Uninviting the whole family was an extreme overreaction, despite his mom probably lying to you that she did not remember the woman. I hope you can move on from this faux pas.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like Max's family has been nothing but supportive participants in your life.\n\nIt was stupid for you to extend the invitation to Max to begin with.  If it was a misunderstanding and he wasn't invited, just added on from other family, you should have contacted them and made it clear he's not welcome.\n\nIt was an asshole move to send him an invitation and retaliate against his entire family when he accepted.", "First, I wouldn\u2019t have invited Max to begin with. Your NTA for having reservations about your ex attending your wedding. However, YTA for uninviting the entire family. That seems incredibly uncalled for. Still, there\u2019s nothing that can be done about it now, but I\u2019d still apologize to max\u2019s parents for the sake of moving on.", "YTA. You went scorched earth when you could have handled this surgically without damaging relationships permanently.\n\nEVERYONE would have understood not inviting Max, and quite honestly, your circle should never have encouraged you to invite him in the first place. You should have trusted your gut.\n\nBut, you could have solved this problem by uninviting Max and telling him exactly why while still inviting his family.", "ESH, all of you made several poor decisions. But i don't think any of you (sans Max) are bad people. If the wedding is already over, i suggest that you and Dennis pay a visit to your Dad's friend and his wife and apologise and maybe take them out to dinner or something.\n\nEdit: If they're Indian, you should ABSOLUTELY do this. Indian newlyweds usually make rounds to family and close friends to thank people for gifts anyway. And bring something as a gift as well. (Source: I am Indian)", "I don\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t just uninvite your ex first. I think because you say that the family has always been kind and supportive YTA for not at least giving them a chance. \n\nIf you uninvited Max and they were rude or problematic about I would understand.", "I understand that you didn\u2019t want to see the two of them together at your wedding, but you handled this so poorly. You shouldn\u2019t have invited your ex in the first place, much less with a date. You should have told his parents they were uninvited verbally, not over text. You could have had an actual discussion with his mother on whether the plus one is the cheating partner (surely his mother would know if they\u2019ve been together for seven years?) You should have warned your parents prior to uninviting their close friends. Ultimately choosing to uninvite was worse than initially excluding. I\u2019d call you ungracious rather than TA but since you asked, in this situation YTA", "YTA. You made the poor choice of inviting your ex, then you made another poor choice in dragging his family into your emotions where they'd have to side with either you or him, then you made ANOTHER poor choice in instead of just uninviting your ex, you uninvite the whole family who, from your post, have been nothing but kind to you.", "YTA that was super rude.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
