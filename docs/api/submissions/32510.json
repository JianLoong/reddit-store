NTA. \n\nWho tells a bride it\u2019s \u201cunfair\u201d to not want the guy that cheated on you at your wedding?? And with the girl he cheated with?? If it was their daughter, you can bet she would feel differently. \n\nThey may be kind and love you, but regarding your wedding she definitely didn\u2019t love you like her own.\n\nSo disrespectful that people in your dad\u2019s circle are gossiping about it (middle school behavior), especially when the core reason Max\u2019s family was disinvited they probably don\u2019t even know. \n\nCongrats on your marriage, it sounds like you ended up with the right guy!", "NTA. What you did was awkward. But would have been better than to endure the painful ex and his cheater gf at your wedding. And max\u2019s mom supported him by saying they you shouldn\u2019t uninvite him for something that happened 7 yrs ago. He cheated on you and didn\u2019t visit you in the hospital during a miscarriage with his baby ? That\u2019s not a small thing to forgive even after 7 yrs.

You made the initial mistake of inviting Max despite your inner turmoil on this. You let you parents and fiance talk you into this (that is their AH part) despite your misgivings. And you could have invited everyone in the family but him by specifying that on the invite. It would have been petty, but understandable. But since you invited him, you cannot police who he is going to bring as a plus one. Uninviting the whole family was an extreme overreaction, despite his mom probably lying to you that she did not remember the woman. I hope you can move on from this faux pas.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like Max's family has been nothing but supportive participants in your life.\n\nIt was stupid for you to extend the invitation to Max to begin with.

Your NTA for having reservations about your ex attending your wedding. However, YTA for uninviting the entire family. That seems incredibly uncalled for.

You went scorched earth when you could have handled this surgically without damaging relationships permanently.\n\nEVERYONE would have understood not inviting Max, and quite honestly, your circle should never have encouraged you to invite him in the first place. You should have trusted your gut.\n\nBut, you could have solved this problem by uninviting Max and telling him exactly why while still inviting his family.", "ESH, all of you made several poor decisions. But i don't think any of you (sans Max) are bad people. If the wedding is already over, i suggest that you and Dennis pay a visit to your Dad's friend and his wife and apologise and maybe take them out to dinner or something.\n\nEdit: If they're Indian, you should ABSOLUTELY do this.

You shouldn\u2019t have invited your ex in the first place, much less with a date. You should have told his parents they were uninvited verbally, not over text. You could have had an actual discussion with his mother on whether the plus one is the cheating partner (surely his mother would know if they\u2019ve been together for seven years?) You should have warned your parents prior to uninviting their close friends. Ultimately choosing to uninvite was worse than initially excluding. I\u2019d call you ungracious rather than TA but since you asked, in this situation YTA", "YTA. You made the poor choice of inviting your ex, then you made another poor choice in dragging his family into your emotions where they'd have to side with either you or him, then you made ANOTHER poor choice in instead of just uninviting your ex, you uninvite the whole family who, from your post, have been nothing but kind to you.", "YTA that was super rude.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But Dennis suggested us holding a reception for our extended family and friends who weren\u2019t invited to the wedding and also invite my dad\u2019s best friend and his wife to it and apologise to them as a couple for excluding them from the main ceremony. Can you advice if that is a good idea?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

You should have just addressed it to the parents, they would\u2019ve understood.", "NTA.   Your ex's mother told you you should forget and forgive what happened because it was 7 years ago. He cheated on you, ghosted you, and darvoed you, in a most difficult time in your life. What she said was absolutely shitty and she didn't deserve to be present at your wedding day.\n\nI don't know the dynamics in your families, but your father is pretty shitty too. He is upset you uninvited his best friend and wife, wasn't he upset their son acted like this towards you?", ">My ex and I haven\u2019t been in contact ever since our breakup, in fact I have actively avoided to go to places I knew for sure he was going to be at and wasn\u2019t interested in interacting with him about my wedding at all\n\n>he is that kind of a guy\n\nYou're trolling us now. 7 years later you still avoid him, felt too uncomfortable sending an un-invite text, but invited to something as intimate as your wedding. Take some accountability. \n\nFor the Mums pov, you had moved on enough to invite her whole family to your wedding to someone else. She gets a call where you vent about the emotional impact her son's actions have caused you, actions she has no knowledge about, then you insist she has to invite her son from your wedding. Obviously she was going to defend her son, you probably came across as stirring drama.", "Not only invited him but generously gave him a +1. She's giving the excuse of printing cards together to bring the printing costs down but what about the cost of adding a +1 for the cheating ex!", "She's extremely right though", "That's all fine, but I think you should also address how you've lashed out in this situation. You admit Max's family was very supportive and understanding, but proceeded to project your panic and anxiety of the situation regarding Max upon all of them. \n\nI think you should try and put yourself in your own shoes from when they were being supportive towards you when you first started dating your husband. Would that you act this way towards the people that have shown you love, simply because of Max's +1?", "Not following your initial intuition is what got you into this mess in the first place. Do you think it's a good idea?", "Just stop. Consolation events are not cool. They're a gift grab.", "No. \n\nUnless your wedding is *tiny*, and *most* people in your lives will not be invited, do not have a reception for the people who didn\u2019t make the cut. They\u2019re going to know they\u2019re the B list and they\u2019re going to wonder if this is just a ploy for more gifts and money. You do not want the kind of talk this will create.", "I don't even get this. Dennis didn't invite his extended family and friends to your ceremony but you had space for a +1 for Max. \n\nI'm half Indian so all of this is just blowing my mind. I've never heard of inviting entire families by printing their names on cards to cut down costs. Or giving +1's to rando people. And every single Indian wedding I've been to in the past 15 years said \"No gifts please. Blessings only\" so this is interesting to me. \n\nThese people are your parents friends. Step out of it and let your parents handle the friendship. If anything your parents should have been firm with them that Max can't come after what he did to you.", "I'm Norm, can confirm this is Indian.", "I suspect the fear was that the family might continue to pressure her to invite Max if they\u2019d retained their own invitations, and OP would be dealing with their guilt trips all the way up to the wedding. \n\nMuch easier to just cut the whole family and call it done. She didn\u2019t handle this with the most grace, I\u2019ll grant, she absolutely should have addressed the invite to Max\u2019s parents exclusively from the start, but it\u2019s done now and it\u2019s probably for the best.", "Had they been just my ex\u2019s family, I wouldn\u2019t have invited them, but I have been close to them even when Max and I weren\u2019t really friends let alone dating. They are my dad\u2019s best friend and his wife and since I still had a good relationship with them, I wanted them to be a part of my big day.", "And it\u2019s not like her family pressured her into inviting him. What\u2019s even stranger to me is OP reacting negatively to the *girls* name, but having no reaction to the cheating ex. OP, turned this mole hill into a mountain.\n\nOP, this isn\u2019t being rude, but if you\u2019re reacting this way after 7yrs, maybe contact a therapist because there\u2019s some trauma here.", "Relaying this info from Dennis\u2019 end, gifts are not expected at Indian receptions, they are expected at the main ceremony and if anyone didn\u2019t make it to the main ceremony then at the reception. Most of Dennis\u2019 extended family weren\u2019t invited, so we would have to host them nonetheless. It is just one of the solutions that is coming to us apart from the suggestions given on here about taking them separately for dinner and apologising. What do you think would be preferable?", "I am not really aware in depth of Indian culture. We weren\u2019t cutting down costs, as per my information, that is how the invites would\u2019ve been sent out if the wedding was happening in India. Also, we were either given gifts or money for our wedding from Dennis\u2019 side of the family, so what you are stating is just different from what happened at our wedding.\n\nAlso, Dennis moved from India to the states for his university and was later joined by his family, so we did what would\u2019ve happened if the wedding happened in India.", "Thanks for the chuckle \ud83e\udd2d", "[removed]", "It was more of him showing up despite being uninvited. He is that kid of a guy. I am acquaintances with one of his exes and he showed up to her wedding without an invite. She found this thread and called me to let me know that he did that \ud83d\ude2d.", "I can't get my head around the cost. What you could have done is send 1 less invitation as a pack and instead make 1 custom invite addressed to dad's best friend and wife only, not the whole family. And this will apparently cost you a couple hundred bucks?", "Invites can be printed together. Then you write the name by hand or stick a label with the names of the ones being invited.", "Parents didn't pressure her but her fiance suggested she give the ex a +1. I've got my eyebrows raised at that. If OP says that's the Indian way I'm going to call BS. \n\nTherapy for sure since she's freaking out just seeing the girls name. And remembers the girls name/pic from 7 years ago.", "Stolen comment?", "I gotta say, I think it was an AH move to talk it over with the mom, she said she\u2019d look into it, and then you uninvited her over a text? Someone you\u2019ve known for years? I think you owe her an apology.", "In the space of three hours she found the thread, identified you, and contacted you to tell you that?\n\nBullshit", "Hey\nSo my response was about something else, I was addressing the fact that both of our sides of invites were printed together, obviously one separate invite wouldn\u2019t have cost us a couple hundred bucks, but we didn\u2019t think of that as an option at that time", "I made the post 7 hours back? What are you talking about with the three hours? She is an acquaintance, I know her, she knows me, we are in each other\u2019s contacts, she isn\u2019t a stranger to me.", "You couldn't have brought a really nice card and some flowers and sent that to your Dad's friend to invite him and his wife?", "You make the post seven hours ago, and you made the comment claiming those obvious lies four hours ago.\n\nWhich gives you a three hour window. \n\nIf he's still with the girl he cheated on you with seven years ago when did he for this other ex in?\n\nOr are you just realising how obvious it is that you're so not over him and freaked out about that and your trying to make up some more reasons why you were totally justified?", "Or hand written a \u201cMr. & Mrs. So-and-so, I hope you can join us for my special day\u201d on the existing invite to clarify who you meant specifically.  Truth is OP, you handled this poorly.", "I am sorry that I didn\u2019t go into detail about his dating life before we dated. Did you miss the paragraph where I mentioned that we were dating for only 3 years out of the 8 years we were friends? We broke up when I was 21, can you do the math? If not, we started dating when we were 18 not when we were 15/16. Is it difficult for you to concur that he could be dating other girls before me(since I didn\u2019t specify, he was)?\n\nI am very much in love with my husband, I didn\u2019t date anyone for almost an year so I don\u2019t date anyone while I am still upset about the breakup. Also he CHEATED. I am sorry if you don\u2019t think that is a good enough reason for me to not want to be around him anymore?", "This makes no sense. He did cheat so you didn't want to be around him anymore. But then decided to invite him to your wedding. And give him a +1. How very generous.", "Nice deflection. It's still an obvious lie that that happened in the space of three hours.\n\nYou invited him to your wedding then had a panic attack when you found out he'd be bringing the girl he chose over you. \n\nYou realise that your bullshit has zero effect on my life, right? You should seriously at least try to be honest with yourself."]}
