Dan and Gina, and their three kids, the oldest of which is a 14 year old boy named Max. \n\nI recently took a week long vacation, and made a deal with Max (communication with his parents) that if he came over to my house one a day when I was gone to take care of my cat, I would pay him $50. He had three main tasks: refill her water dish and automatic feeder, brush her, and clean her litter box every other day. \n\nWhen I came back, I found my poor Kitty noticeably skinnier, with knots in her fur and a litterbox with a week\u2019s worth of urine and feces in it. I took the next hour to give my kitty some tlc and make up for Max\u2019s incompetence. \n\nThe next day, Gina and Max rang my doorbell and Gina made polite conversation before asking about the money. I told her about how badly Max had taken care of my cat, and Gina apologized. She then said that, due to his actions, she said that it would be fine to pay him only $20. \n\nI told her that no, I would not be paying him anything because it\u2019s clear that he never came over at all. Gina argued that I couldn\u2019t know that (true, I don\u2019t have cameras), and that he\u2019s just a kid and he did sacrifice his freetime with the expectation that he\u2019d get paid. That I should at least give him $10 as a learning experience. I refused and shut the door on them. \n\nNow, I respect workers and their time, and I understand that when you hire someone you pay for their time and their skill. In my opinion, Max didn\u2019t give his skill, and I have a strong suspicion that he didn\u2019t give his time either.

(Especially since she was involved enough to negotiate pay).  It will take time to repair the friendship and you and your wife will likely never trust them quite the same way after this betrayal.\n\nYour wife may grieve that.

Also, try seeing if any of your neighbors might have an outdoor security camera pointed at your house to see if he actually bothered to show up.", "NTA.

Who trusts their pet to a 14-year old for a whole week and has no way of tracking whether they actually came over and did the job? If you don't have cameras or an alarm he has to turn on/off when he comes and goes (where you can see a log on a mobile app), you should have at least checked in with him. At the same time, he should have done his job, and his parents should have put the same oversight into this as they did their attempts to get his pay.

Clean out litterbox. Usually takes me about 2 minutes, plus another minute to walk out to the garbage can. Refill water dish and feeder. I'll be generous and allow 5 minutes, if there's a complicated mechanism that Max has to figure out.\n\nBrush the cat. Assuming your cat likes being brushed (most do), then I'd hang out on your couch for half an hour watching TV and brushing your cat. If your cat is shy or nervous, it could reasonably be that she hid from Max, in which case he couldn't reasonably brush her.
