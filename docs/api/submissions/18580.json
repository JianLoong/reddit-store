Would you rather he terrify her by pinning her down and forcing a brush on her?\n\nI'd give him $10.

I only brush my cat when she's excessively shedding because she (like most cats) does an excellent job of grooming herself. But a worried, hungry cat is not going to groom itself properly. That could led to the fur issues. \n\nThe automatic feeder question is valid, but not all of them are large. I once had a small one that would only hold maybe 3-4 days worth of food; that's still 3-4 days without, just as an example. Multiple, consecutive days without food is still serious. I also had a cat once that had 0 control with food; he'd just eat & eat what you put in front of him. (This is why I stopped using the small automatic feeder.) Kitty could have scarfed down excess food earlier in the week, then starved when the neighbor didn't return. \n\nI also thought OP's description sounded extreme at first (like it could be exaggerated), and without more details & accountability from Max/mom, it's hard to say; but OP's description is entirely possible, depending on how much of the week kitty was ignored (sounds like most, if not all of it).", "Actually, yeah, that\u2019s exactly how the exchange of money for goods and services works. \n\nIf I pay you to cater an event and serve roast chicken and fresh salad to 50 people, and you show up three hours late with nothing but three cans of tuna and two tubes of go-gurt, you\u2019re not seeing a dime of the agreed-upon price, because you did not provide *any* of the agreed-upon services.", "The backup plan was *his parents*.

Pet care costs are much higher than what i paid to my friend.", "My friend stayed at my place for free with food, which was closer to his work. I have an automatic litter box and food is easy to scoop lol. Its only 2 cats, im just saying that the price is low for someone that can afford to go on a vacation for a week. And owns a home.", "Fair", "This is a neat idea. I don't blame OP if they weren't interested in going this route; it may not be worth bothering. But if there is a genuine friendship with the family and a genuine hope the kid can do better, this could be really beneficial for everyone. \n\nIn a way, it's like he's being asked to do service to make up for what he did wrong (which, seriously, I know he's a kid, but it's borderline criminal to agree to care for an animal and leave it in that state). This would go beyond the consequence of not getting paid (for a job he didn't do) and actually have him attempt to make amends to OP. Frankly, the apple doesn't seem to fall far from the tree if mom is willing to defend his negligence, but if I were the parent, I'd love a plan like this as a tool to help teach that when you say you'll do a job, you follow through and do it.", "I value people's time & the safety/wellbeing of my animals. I use to house sit on the regular as well. I'd  rather my animals be in more professional hands instead of a family favor tbh.", "And I said what I said :)", "it literally is though", "Now I\u2019m just wondering how many people you think a reasonable person needs to have lined up to take care of a single cat for a week. OP had three people on deck, do you think they needed four? Five? Seven? What if seven people drop the ball? Should OP have had eight? \n\nRidiculous take. None of this was OP\u2019s fault.", "I wonder why this whole situation didn\u2019t bother the wife. Was she hoping the cat would accidentally escape and get loose and plotted this with her friend? I don\u2019t know many pet owners who are good pet owners like these two seem to be who would just say let it go", "I said nothing even remotely close to suggesting it was OPs \u201cjob\u201d.

I think Max did the work but did a poor job. Even if the results weren\u2019t up to par, they had a contract and OP is obligated to fulfill his end. He does not have the right to not pay because he isn\u2019t happy. That\u2019s not how that works. lol\n\nAnd you thinking that it\u2019s ok to not pay because you\u2019re not satisfied doesn\u2019t make that the law of the land. lol No matter how many downvotes I get or upvotes you get.", "\"Why didn't you use this information that wasn't in the post you're judging to judge the post!?\"", "Seems like a lot more then just me and OP who believe it :)", "It\u2019s much better to be wrong in a crowd.

He can testify behind a screen with a voice modulator.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNah but frfr NTA. Taking care of a cat isn't all that hard. I'd argue apart from the poo/pee it's pretty fun! Play with a cat for 50$?!?!? Forget young Max, next time call me!", "NTA. If Gina cared about the money - let alone the cat - so much, she could\u2019ve done the work instead.

We/she did it for free, too.", "I don\u2019t know,how much does one pay for animal neglect these days? Does this kid not care that he dropped the ball on a living creature? I would NOT be cool with these people after this.

Guess we know where the kid got his cavalier attitude towards animals. NTA.", "Don't do the work, don't get paid. NTA and I'm glad your kitty is doing better.", "NTA. But, since you don't know that he didn't come over at all and do anything, you should probably give him some sort of compensation. $10 would probably be my max.\n\nThis is why you hire professional petsitters, and not the neighbor's teenaged kid. I am such a pet sitter, and my clients with teenagers hire me for pet care even if their teens will be home because they just can't rely on them! Why would you entrust your beloved companion to someone you are not 100% sure will take care of them? It's not something you gamble with.\n\nI'm sorry you and your kitty went through this, and I'm so glad your cat is alive and okay. Consider this a lesson hard learned.", "NTA.

It could\u2019ve been a good learning experience for him but she ruined it by protecting him from talking with you. He didn\u2019t do what you hired him to do so he doesn\u2019t get paid.", "Esh. I almost feel like paying a 14yr old boy 50 to come by every day for a week, you get what you pay for. Sadly, the cats the one that paid. I am assuming he at least came by & put down water & a little food (once or twice) or your cat probably wouldn't be here. I also think you should have checked in with him. My sister (50s) babysits my dogs when we go out of town, shes more than capable but i call daily.\n I think its a damn shame that this boys parents not only let him slowly torture an animal by denying its basic needs but then have the nerve to back him up & demand payment. She showed her hand from jump when she didnt even ask for the full amount & didnt seem surprised or deny it. Had i known my kid did a job & didnt get paid for it, im not coming over asking for a fraction. But then again, if someone told me my kid left an animal locked in a house, no food or water, no clean litter, my kid is in trouble.", "Hell no. Never talk to these animal abusers again!", "NTA.\n\nMy neighbors had cats growing up. It was common for them to leave for a long weekend and for the same arrangements to be made with my parents.\n\nOne time my mother told me WEEKS ahead of time that the neighbors were going away for 5 days.\n\nFast-forward to a few weeks later I asked my mother when that was happening so I could go over.\n\n\"What?! They get back tonight!'\"\n\nI ran over and fed those cats as much as I could put in them, I would watch them eat a can and then open another one. I cleaned everything I could in the 4 hours I had.\n\nThey got back and my neighbor says \"hey, the cats tell me you did a great job, here you go\" and tried to hand me $50. I refused and explained that they went without food for some time and told him how the day went and apologized.\n\nI say this because that is how you learn a lesson. You own it, you accept it was your fault (even though it was totally my mother's)  and you fix it. If the kid was worth anything he would turn down the money if offered.", "It's even worse than that. It's animal abuse and cruelty, what Max did and what the mother allowed to happen.", "NTA for reasons everyone has already mentioned.\n\nI do want to recommend maybe seeing a vet, cats who go more than a few days without eating at all can get seriously ill due to the way their livers function.", "> That I should at least give him $10 as a learning experience. I refused and shut the door on them. \n\nThe learning experience is that if you don't the job, you don't get paid.

We once had a family friend (19 year old) cat sit for 2 weeks, like they used our home as their own for that time which they loved because they could be 'independent' for that time. The litter was so bad when we got home that I refused to EVER let her look after the cats again. It was so bad they had begun peeing on the lounge rug instead. \n\nShe also flooded our yard because she didn't look after the chickens properly and didn't notice that the hose to their water was disconnected -_- she never stayed at our place or looked after our minions again.", "Depends on the size of the box, size of the cat, and type of litter I suppose. ONE week with a large box average cat wouldn't be awful...I use a box where the pee drains to a pad in the bottom so I change the pad every week (a bit longer now that I added a second box) honestly if your cats will use it I'd definitely recommend cleanup is SO much easier. I HATED scooping the litter esp when they only pee in ONE corner so it's a big block of pee ugh. The worst part about cats xD", "Highly recommend an inside camera. We have doorbell cams, and thought it was enough seeing the petsitter come and go until one trip, a friend called me very upset. At the time, we were fostering rabbits and she had gone in (with our knowledge and permission) to pick up one for a vet appointment and told me that the litter boxes looked like they hadn\u2019t been changed since we had left. She was ready to take the foster rabbits to her house. We spoke to the sitter, a college student, and she did better the rest of the week, but damn. Not well. Worth it to have a way to check.", "Absolutely. Cats can get by without drinking water as long as they get sufficient hydration from wet food, but that only pans out if they're actually getting that food.

To make it look like you proved a point? \ud83e\udd23", "the proof is in the fact that the cat was neglected. op doesn\u2019t owe anyone anything. begging for handouts isn\u2019t a good look", "Not really. It\u2019s about making sure people meet reasonable expectations. If you do something properly you get paid. If you don\u2019t do it properly you don\u2019t deserve money."]}
