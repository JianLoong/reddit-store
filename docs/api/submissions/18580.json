I once had a small one that would only hold maybe 3-4 days worth of food; that's still 3-4 days without, just as an example. Multiple, consecutive days without food is still serious. I also had a cat once that had 0 control with food; he'd just eat & eat what you put in front of him. (This is why I stopped using the small automatic feeder.)

And if she brings it up again I would counter that minus the 50 dollars Max owes me X amount of dollars for the balance  vet/grooming bill and medicine required for his abuse of my animal. And yes I'd actually bring my cat to vet to be looked over because since Max had access to my house who knows if he accidentally or purposefully mistreated the cat before he decided to abandon his duties. Just because he didn't feed water groom or change the litter box doesn't mean he wasn't in your home watching TV. Hanging out whatever.\nOh. And install a camera before your next vacation. It will give you piece of mind to be able to check in and verify things are well", "NTA. His learning experience is that he fails to do his job, he doesn't get paid.", "It wouldn't take an hour to do the bare minimum, which would still have been better than doing nothing. Change water, top up food, pick out bits from litter tray and a give a few brush strokes? He could have been in and out in ten minutes if that's all he could be arsed to do.", "I don't understand why nobody is saying this. That poor cat.", "10 dollars is a lot to pay for animal neglect. \n\nBy paying him ANYTHING for leaving an animal hungry, soiled and matted, he\u2019s taught that it\u2019s okay to ignore your responsibilities because you\u2019ll still get some level of reward. Where is the motivation to do better if you get money for fucking it up?\n\nIf their friendship is ruined over this; that is the fault of the kid neglecting OP\u2019s pet and the parent deciding that her son needs a participation award rather than having a consequence for her son, who had a living creature depending on him.", "Also, the part where she says \u201cyou couldn\u2019t have known that\u201d as opposed to \u201cyes he did!\u201d Is very telling of what actually happened", "Damn I looked after my sister and best friends cats (in two different households) for free. You're telling me you get paid to do that?!\n\nI'm out here giving 5 star loving and feeding for free and this kid couldn't do less for more. Absolutely incredible!", "Thanks for sharing your experience!  My first thought was ; if my cat didn't have her litter cleaned, she would just go on the carpet. Cats are great at dishing natural consequences. \n\nYour sweet kitty held it in as much as she could, and she got sick :( poor girl.", "it is OP intention, not mine.", "Yep, he got his participation trophy", "Yeah. A regular visit alone is like \u00a346 with our vet these days.", "A good cat sitter is worth their weight in gold, honestly!", "If my teenage was taking care of someone's pet I would A) make sure they did it and B) would follow up and if they didn't I would. This is a living creature we are talking about. Cats need fresh water and food daily or can quickly develop health problems.", "OP said cat was noticably thinner.", "Cat probably had some water left, at least for the first few days. The cat probably doesn't drink the whole bowls worth of water every day, but normally cats should get fresh water each day, most cats prefer fresh water. In a pinch I assume the cat would just continue to drink the stale water though if that is all they had. Hopefully the automatic feeder would have had enough food for several days too, but this definitely sounds like it could have been dangerous for the poor cats health", "They can't survive a whole week without water, no. A few days, tops. They can also get hepatic lipidosis if they don't eat anything (or eat minimally) for 3-4 days in a row, and if they end up with fibrosis of the liver, that's a one way street to liver failure.", "\"feeder mice\" -- so you raise reptiles?", "You didn\u2019t read the post, corrected yourself, and somehow *still* managed to make baseless assumptions about OP. That\u2019s on you."]}
