Would you rather he terrify her by pinning her down and forcing a brush on her?\n\nI'd give him $10. Because he obviously fed the cat. \nAnd then explain to him that not taking responsibility when he's been hired to do something has consequences.", "NTA.

I would've been furious and charged them for the vet bills", "I started catsitting for an out-of-town neighbor when I was much younger than 14 & knew better not to neglect a living creature. My grandmother supervised it bc she was the one with the relationship with the neighbor lady. The mother of the kid here is vastly to blame. NTA.", "I use to take care of my family friend\u2019s cat for 2 weeks when I was less than 10 years old.  A 14 year is more than capable of taking care of a cat.", "Automatic feeder doesn't fill *itself* up.", "The cynical part of me thinks Max was in no way aware of this arrangement, and Gina was just trying to con some money off her neighbor.", "Learning to scam the system? \"See kid, you can always skate by and still get paid. Figure out the angle for each mark, I mean job.\"", "I wouldn\u2019t even take off the \u00a350. He didn\u2019t earn it and wilfully endangered the cat. Charge him the lot.", "Had something similar happen when I was a kid.\n\nHired a friend of mine to take care of the pets.  We had hired his sister previously without issue.\n\nCame back from vacation after a week.  Every food/water dish empty, litter boxes literally overflowing with cat poo, bedroom door was left open that resulted in a dead hamster with a destroyed glass cage.\n\nWe obviously never paid him and I didn't hang out with him after that.  Fortunately the family never asked about it though.\n\nHaving been in the same situation, there's no way in hell I would pay.", "Idk it could be an opportunity for a valuable lesson. Explain to the kid exactly why he won\u2019t be paid, but maybe offer a chance to earn the money (and maybe a little bit of trust) back by coming over on weekends- when you\u2019re home of course, to do yard work or something. Have him cut the grass, take out the garbage etc. If they have indeed been good neighbors, it might be worth it to give their kid another shot while having more control over the situation. Could be a beneficial experience for all involved (including his parents).", "okay, then he is definitely liable for not caring for your cat.", "I'm not saying a 14 year old is not capable, just that in this day and age, any pet owner would either have the means of tracking comings and goings or would check in via phone or text.", "Same. Maybe Gina brokered the deal hoping to teach Max some responsibility and the value of a dollar, but Max wasn't having it and did squat. She gambled with the cat's life.", "It\u2019s not OP\u2019s job to parent the neighbours kid, especially when that kid wilfully endangers an animal. Kid doesn\u2019t deserve a second chance and neither do the parents."]}
