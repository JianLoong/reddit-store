My situation isn't ideal so I have been fortunate to move home to be with my parents who have been very supportive.

However, since I have moved I have barely heard from my sister, communication has been minimal despite my attempts. On asking, she has said that she is jealous I am in our home country with our parents and feels like she is intruding. I have reassured her multiple times that she isn't, I would love to hear from her more and that I miss her and my nephew. This past week, my sister came to visit for a week with her son and husband, during this time I bought cakes, presents, cooked and cleaned for them all as it was her husband and sons birthdays, I was so excited, but like every other visit home, they brought a 'bug' and I ended up so sick that I was throwing up and in bed for a few days, I've since been put on antibiotics. While she was home my sister mentioned coming home at the end of March, I said nothing at the time but since then I have been thinking that this is not something that I want, for many reasons. I tried to ask my sister if she would wait 2 weeks before coming to visit, in order to give me time to get into a routine and to heal. That didn't go well, she rang my mother screaming crying about how unfair I was being. I purposely didn't tell her my real reasons for not wanting her here and tried to spare her feelings. It stresses me out that my sister would be coming with her son and husband around this time as they need to constantly be catered to, they don't help at all when they visit, I wouldn't have access to the upstairs toilet after giving birth which comes with its own problems, my sister has not been involved with my pregnancy at all (even ruining my gender reveal by making it about her), every time she has visited they have brought illness with them and I do not want that for my newborn baby, the idea terrifies me. Honestly, I really don't want them here at all, or maybe just my sister and nephew, but I thought a 2 week wait was a compromise, because I know she wants to be here to meet her niece.

Bringing a newborn back to the hospital with an infection hurts so much. Your baby is your priority, not waiting hand and foot on your sister and her family. It sounds like your sister is upset to lose you as her main helper. She\u2019s going to have to learn to deal with that. \n\nMy advice is, move out as soon as you can. Stay close to your parents but get your own small place. That way you have a support system, but don\u2019t feel obligated to host your sister.\n\nETA. Your sister seems to have main character syndrome. Why else would she have basically cut contact with you when you weren\u2019t there to help her anymore? I hope that your relationship becomes fairer. Because right now it\u2019s very one-sided.", "Pathetic that you still laugh about yourself.", "read what, the comments? i gave my judgement based on the post and didn\u2019t read the comments.", "ITS her House. The Parents can move"]}
