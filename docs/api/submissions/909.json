{"id": 909, "submission_id": "ykdgjo", "title": "AITA For \"stealing\" my MIL's heirloom recipe and bringing it to a potluck", "selftext": "I (38M) have always enjoyed cooking and baking.  My wife (37F) on the other hand, does not.  So I do probably 95% of the cooking in our house and I like to think I'm pretty good at it.  My MIL (70F) is also an exceptional cook and we've both shared recipes with each other over the years.  But there is one recipe that she refuses to share with me, her apple pie.\n\nShe says it's her great-grandmother's recipe and has been in the family for over 100 years.  It's amazing, literally the perfect pie.  After years of her making it and refusing to share the recipe I stopped asking.  But I started experimenting on my own trying to reverse engineer it and recreate it.  I did this by taking a slice home every chance I could so that I could use it as a taste test.\n\nIt took a lot of test runs and failures, but this year is the closest I have ever gotten to recreating it.  It's not 100% there yet, but it is damn close.  I know I'm still missing something, but I haven't figured out that final piece yet.\n\nMy wife's family had a potluck get together this past weekend because MIL had a fall (she's fine, just bruised).  She was just kind of scared by the whole ordeal, she had to go to the hospital to make sure nothing was broken.  She wanted people to get together so that she could have some comfort.  Since she's not able to do too much physically, I offered to bake apple pie and bring it.  So I made an apple pie as close to MIL's recipe as I possibly could.  Again, not a 100% recreation, but really close.\n\nWhen people started having desserts, a few people made comments about how amazing it was that MIL was able to still cook her apple pie after what happened.  MIL looked confused and said that she didn't make her apple pie.  I said that I made it and tried to recreate MIL's recipe.  MIL said I couldn't have made it exactly like hers because she never gives out that recipe.  I told her I didn't use her recipe, I've just been trying to recreate it the past few years.\n\nShe tried a slice and immediately accused me of stealing her recipe somehow.  I reiterated that I never got her recipe, I've just been trying to reverse engineer it and that I know it's close, but it's not there yet and something is still missing.  But she was convinced that I stole her recipe somehow and it started a fairly big argument that ended with me being asked to leave.\n\nMy wife ended up staying behind to \"calm things down\" before coming home. When she got back she was pissed at me too.  She said I should have known better than to bring something like that when MIL is not in good shape.  She said I got MIL all wound up and irritated all so that I could try and boost my ego and try to make MIL look bad.\n\nShe said I should know how much that recipe means to MIL and that it's one thing to try and recreate it at home, but I was totally in the wrong to bring it to a potluck like that when people are expecting MIL to make the apple pie.  Mind you, my wife was 100% aware I was bringing that pie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  I seriously and honestly thought this would be a nice way to honor MIL.  There was no malicious intent behind my actions.  Some of you are incredibly cynical to attempt to attach desires of revenge or malice when I was just trying to do something nice for MIL when she's feeling down.  Clearly my execution was poor and it was received badly.  But I had ZERO intention of \"showing up\" MIL or trying to replace her recipe.  I was just trying to do something nice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2:  I think coming here was a mistake.  Some of you are seriously mean people.  I was just trying to do something nice and you're making me feel like a total POS.  Yes, I made a mistake in judgment, but it wasn't malicious.  I think that's enough internet for today.

It sounds like this was her one thing, from working with elderly people I've seen many that feel like their life is over, they have nothing to contribute and feel left out/alone. This was something that made her happy, it was something that made her feel like she was still special and you had to go take that from her.", "Soft YTA / ESH\n\nYou knew it was a point of pride for her, hence her strange refusal to share the recipe.  You should have easily made the next mental leap, that bringing 'her pie' to a family event would not be well recieved. You basically said: \"f\\*\\*k you, I'm getting the recipe anyway!!\"\n\nShe is definitely the weird one here, but you really should have known not to poke that particular bear.\n\nETA: I don't blame you for reverse engineering the pie.  I'm a fair cook and consider anything I taste/see to be fair game for me to try.  You should have just kept it (pie) away from MIL.", "I feel like I really need to see the recipe in order to make an informed decision on this.", "This reminds me of a story I heard a long time ago. The husband kept criticizing his wife\u2019s pumpkin pie and year after year all she heard was it was never as good as his mother\u2019s. She finally got so fed up that she went to the store and just bought the Libbey\u2019s canned pie filling.

Yes its a silly recipe and her stranglehold on it but its important to her.  You could have accomplished the same thing by just making your pie and not saying you were trying to copy her recipe.  People could have asked and all you had to do was be mum about it while claiming you baked it.  \n\nI think you deliberately poked the bear and earned an ear full.  I think your MiL's argument was stupid and her accusation baseless.  I also like to cook and have reverse engineered recipes too.  The problem is I think you knew your MiL would get a rise out of this and wanted to show off a bit.  I think you could have handled this so much better without rubbing in your MiL's face and still would have had people appreciating your pie.  What was more important to you?  The accuracy and closeness of your pie recipe and subsequent appreciation or your MiL's reaction?  I think you failed to know and predict your audience\n\nIm voting for ESH.", "YTA, not for recreating the recipe but for taking it to a potluck with your MIL's family. That's not cool.

On the one hand it's nice that you wanted to pay tribute to your MIL's baking ability by \"figuring out\" her pie - and maybe under other circumstances she could have appreciated your effort (especially if you told her that despite your best efforts over a number of YEARS you couldn't get it quite right so hers is still the best) -- but under the circumstances, with a fall, and fear, and beneath that (probably) the dread of getting older and dying, it seems like you hit a nerve with her, possibly about becoming obsolete and superfluous. And she reacted out of that fear.\n\nNAH. Sometime when she's in a better headspace, tell her about your years-long effort of pie smuggling & recreation, and make sure to emphasize how amazing her pie is, and how you could never \\*quite\\* match it. It's a sweet story, and maybe at a later date she could hear it like the compliment it is.", "The best thing about family recipes is that they get passed down through the generations and lovingly taught by the previous gen to the new gen.

It\u2019s apple pie, a quintessential american dish, it\u2019s not special. Sure her recipe has been in her family for a long time but there only so many ways to make a classic apple pie.", "So I have a similar experience.. my husband's family has a family recipe book. He has a brother and he's married, and neither one of them cook. My husband mentioned that he wanted the family heirloom to go to me (his wife) because I love cooking and he brought this up to this mother, it has recipes in it back to 5 generations. Mainly it's holiday baking recipes, but they said nobody can make turnips like his grandmother can.. during Christmas last year his grandmother was upset because she can't make them any longer, she said cutting them up hurts her wrists too much. This year I offered to help and said that I would love to come down and make the recipe with her sometime. She is 91 and a hell of a woman, battled cancer and won, got through the war, I think she's amazing.\n\nAnyways, asking her kindly to help was my approach, if she didn't want help then that's understandable. I understand where you are coming from though, I was really tempted to try to make her recipe because it seemed important to the rest of the family, too important not to try to preserve. I think you had good intentions, but unfortunately as they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Unfortunately your actions unintendly upset and hurt the family, you have to take responsiblity and accept the consequences of your actions even if you didnt' have any bad intentions.\n\nIt's a silly hill to try to die on, I would apologize and try to make amends. Maybe explain that you had the best intentions but you can see why they would be upset and you are sorry for that. I hope this helps out.", "NTA. Recipes shouldn't be gatekeeped. It's an apple pie, not KFC's secret blend of herbs and spices.\n\nYour heart was definitely in the right place, and I wish your MIL had seen it for what it was. One of the very first things my MIL did after my marriage was give me her recipe for Victoria sponge. Basic recipe, you can get from the BBC Good Food site. But she is now gone, and I still have that recipe and it means everything to me.\n\nThis was really a lost opportunity for your MIL to bond with you. She knows your wife doesn't cook. It would have been really sweet for her to give you the recipe.\n\nBut the real AH here is your wife, who knew you were baking the pie, then suddenly turned on you. She should have either defended you to her mother or warned you not to do it.", "Honestly, if she doesn\u2019t give someone the recipe, it will cease to exist. Her daughter doesn\u2019t cook you do.  She should give you the recipe. My mother had one and it died with her. It is an act of self righteousness BS she won\u2019t.", "JUST CAME HERE TO ASK FOR THE RECIPE?", "NAH.  \nI come from a family where Not sharing a recipe if asked for it is seen as something close to sin. \nAnd I agree, if you love cooking/baking, food and happy people, then Why wouldn\u2019t you want to share and make more people happy?\n\nA famous danish chef once said: \u201cthe grandma who takes her recipes to the grave will not be allowed in my heaven.\u201d\n\nYou tried to do something you felt would be seen as an honoring of someone, you intentions were good.\nBut you Knew you mil was very sensitive about that One recipe and you still chose that one. \n\nSo no, not an outright asshole, but perhaps a bit of an idiot for not using your brain and thinking about What you were doing and Who it involved.", "Is this a repost? I read this story almost word for word on this sub a few months ago", "INFO Why did you want to recreate the pie. She doesn't want you to have the recipe. I'm curious because this comes to a lot on this sub and I want to know why people do it?\n\nSomeone is proud of the recipe. It's like family thing or they just pride themselves on cooking and don't want to share the recipe. What is the the motivation to jeep trying to make it and to bring it to an event where other people willing comment on it?", "NTA, especially because you told her you were bringing apple pie \ud83e\udd23 your MIL and wife are the AH\u2019s in my opinion.

It's fun to see all the replies here", "NTA - if your wife thought this would be a problem she should have spoken up before hand. \n\nIf anything I\u2019m getting a very strong MIL as narcissist vibe (only she can have the recipe and only she can make the pie). Which leads to a bigger question. If MIL\u2019s recipe has been in her family for over 100 years, that implies it has been handed down. I thought family recipes were shared with subsequent generations by at least their early adulthood. When will this recipe be handed down to OP\u2019s wife (MIL\u2019s daughter)? Upon death of MIL? Is it bequeathed in her will? Is its dissemination controlled by a family trust? Is it kept in a vault like the recipes for Coca-Cola, KFC, and some brand of baked beans (can\u2019t remember the brand name, but I believe it\u2019s guarded by a talking dog).  \n\nIs it not being shared with the daughter because she\u2019s not a cook? Is it sexist to not share with SIL? Is the recipe passed down to DIL\u2019s?\n\nAnd OP - to recreate an apple pie recipe from taste (and smell) only is a testament to your acuity and skill level in cooking - further evident by the fact that you know \u201csomething is still missing\u201d yet the entire family is convinced you stole the recipe after having first thought MIL made the pie. \n\nThere is only one thing left for you to do OP. Next time you make the same pie - only you make it BETTER!", "NTA. Gatekeeping recipes is fucking stupid if your livelihood isn't based on it. You were trying to do something nice and your wife, who knows your MIL best, obviously didn't think it would be a problem or she'd have said something before the get together.", "I get that it's not intentional, but it was definitely a bad move to try to duplicate her recipe that she guards jealously specifically at a time when she is unable to make it herself and is likely feeling self-conscious.  That was a very, very dumb thing to do.\n\nBy the rules of the forum, YTA.  But, clearly it should be acknowledged that you weren't trying to be an AH.  You just fucked up.\n\nYou should apologize to MIL for making her feel bad, and point out that you haven't stolen anything, you just think she makes a perfect pie and so of course while you try to improve yours it keeps turning into more and more like hers.\n\nAnd then quietly take it as a huge compliment that your pie was so fucking great that it caused a drama.\n\nEdit: And then never, ever, make a pie again for this family. You are stepping on somebody's toes. Just make it for other people.", "YTA did you really think a woman who has been keeping the pie recipe secret for years would be happy you kept sequestering pie pieces away till you figured it out? Did you think she would be impressed that when she, someone who clearly loves cooking, couldn't make a favorite dish, you whipped out your newly acquired knowledge?\n\nGreat job on bonding with your MIL over cooking. Even better job burning that relationship to the ground in one go.", "Why wasn\u2019t your attempt to recreate it an open discussion with her", "NTA\n\nPeople are freaking nuts. No one owns a particular taste. If you had actually stolen her recipe that would be one thing. But instead you did what we all do - found a taste you loved and tried to recreate it. It\u2019s a compliment FFS!", "I\u2019m torn between everyone sucks and no asshole. I can see how everyone did what they did without bad intentions but the end result was stupid on all sides. OP, I don\u2019t think you consciously meant to show up your MIL but I do think that if you truly, honestly considered your intentions over the YEARS you have spent trying to recreate something she didn\u2019t want you to have you would find some less than charitable truths. And you were extremely insensitive in bringing the pie to this party. Maybe you\u2019re just really bad at understanding other people\u2019s emotions but it should have been obvious she was not going to be happy. This person has deliberately kept this recipe to herself for decades, did you really think she would be pleased you were trying to copy it? Or did you just get excited for yourself and not really consider what she would feel? I\u2019ll guessing the second, again even if you weren\u2019t consciously thinking about it. \n\nAnd yes, her refusal to share her recipe is dumb but maybe consider that it makes her feel special and important, perhaps in a way she hasn\u2019t always felt in her life? People aren\u2019t always rationale, and having good relationships requires us all to accept that even if something doesn\u2019t make sense to us it may be very important to someone we care about. \n\nYou were not thinking about how this would be for her.

As for OP, I absolutely say you're NTA. But tbh if they're gonna be this petty and you want to just smooth things over do the mea culpa to the family and leave it at that until MIL finally drops.

However, I would say your MIL is a HUGE AH for accusing you of stealing her recipe.  It's a flippin pie.

You made pie. You reverse engineered it because you thought it was the most perfect pie ever. This is a huge compliment that she is not seeing IMHO.

And quiet honestly, I would encourage people in similar situations with secret family recipes to try and figure them out. Cause if she heaven forbid passes or forgets the recipe before she hands it down it is lost forever. Like my family lost pretty much all of our family recipes because my grandmother never wanted to pass them down to anyone that wasn't blood and she developed Alzheimers and forgot them all. So instead of my uncle who loves to cook learning the recipes 20 years ago. No one knows them because she was waiting for one of the blood grandkids to learn to cook to hand them down to.

There are millions of families the world and every damn one of them has a special recipe that supposedly no one else in the world can make.  Bull! There are only so many ways to make a pie and only so many things you can reasonably add to the ingredients. \nYou spent time reverse engineering a recipe you liked. I guarantee your MIL does not hold a patent on this recipe.  If anything she should be proud she inspired you to do all this work to copy it and flattered, not throw a tantrum like a child. \n\nP.S. for the record I once was gifted my inlaws famous family super secret recipe for a certain cake that I had to swear never to share outside the family.

Maybe instead of bringing the pie for the entire family, if you either went to her house or she came to yours where you could better explain your intentions would have been the better move.\n\nWas your wife setting you up for this? How can she be mad at you when she knew your intentions with the pie and say you should have known better after the fact?

I personally don\u2019t believe in keeping recipes secret, and I don\u2019t think you were wrong to try to recreate it on your own.

Just a touch.", "NTA. You didn't steal the recipe. Stealing the recipe would involve going through her papers or something. She refuse to share the recipe so your developed your own. All apple pies share ingredients in common. Ignore the people saying Y T A.

I don\u2019t know why that generation is so protective of their recipes. My grandmother was like that too. She gave me her recipes but told me to never share them. Sorry grandma. Sounds like you make a pretty good pie, OP!", "NTA recipes are meant to be used and enjoyed. Your MIL is weird about being so territorial over a pie recipe.

I can't believe your wife feels this way now after being fully aware that you had been trying to recreate the pie and that you were taking it. Ouch.\n\nWhy would MIL want this secret to die with her? Heirlooms are meant to be enjoyed and passed down, not hoarded and used create hate and drama. WTF.", "NTA.

Perhaps there\u2019s an argument to be made that it was short sighted and you maybe should have known that she\u2019d react badly to your attempted recreation of her perfect pie, but I\u2019ve stepped in it enough times myself to know that doesn\u2019t always click ahead of time.

For an apple pie?! \n\nI\u2019m gonna go with NTA - maybe this wasn\u2019t the right time or occasion for it, but honestly she deserves to know that her apple pie isn\u2019t all that!", "last time someone posted here about \u201crecreating\u201d their spouse\u2019s family recipe they got a resounding YTA. I expect the same here.", "NTA.  Here\u2019s the thing: you didn\u2019t actually steal it.  You spent a long time through trial-and-error trying to recreate it, yes, but that\u2019s not actually stealing.  You didn\u2019t sneak in and take the paper recipe, you didn\u2019t pester your MIL until she caved, you just practiced, and practice makes perfect.\n\nThink of it this way.  I\u2019ve played piano for 22 years.  As the eldest of my siblings and cousins, I often found piano songs that I liked and would alter them both because I have small hands and can\u2019t always reach the required chords, and because sometimes the arrangements were bad.  My great-grandmother did the same and I inherited her sheet music with all her personal annotations.  If I had a favourite song from my great-grandma that I liked to play and my sister asked and I refused to give her the music because I didn\u2019t want her \u201ccopying\u201d me, and she listened to me play and figured it out on her own, would that be \u201cstealing\u201d?  No, it\u2019s not.\n\nYour MIL is within her rights to refuse to give you the recipe, but she\u2019s not within her rights to prohibit you from trying to recreate it on your own time, dime, and recognizance.

You developed it. Your wife OTOH is an A H. She should have stood up for you", "NTA but also, maybe not the smartest idea? You know MIL is protective of her \"amazing\" apple pie. It was obtuse to think she would love you for it. \n\nProbably also if you hadn't gone into great detail about the reverse engineering, it might have just been written off by everyone. Like, oh I just made the best pie I could. I'm so happy it tastes similar to MILs as she's an amazing baker!", "Soft YTA\n\nShe is very protective of the recipe and feels it is special.

Your mother in law was not ready to let go of this recipe, it means a lot to her. She shared others with you, but this one was out of bounds.

And it's not even like this is something she created, she got it from her great grandma! Who thankfully wasn't as selfish or controlling as MIL otherwise noone would have the recipe.", "NTA. Holding a recipe hostage is nothing more than a power play. Your MIL is the AH for it.  \n\n\nYou are certainly free to experiment on your own and try to recreate it, and I don't believe making it was malicious on your part.

The man commented on how great my dad's BBQ sauce was, but that was the one recipe my dad wouldn't give up. \n\nBut, over the course of the next several months, as the firefighters would periodically eat at this BBQ joint, my dad noticed the BBQ sauce kept getting closer and closer to his own. \n\nThen, the progress stopped for awhile just short of nailing it. So close. But finally, one day my dad realized that the old man had figured out that last ingredient. They shared a laugh together, shook hands, and everyone was happy. \n\nThat old man was C.B. Stubblefield, and that was Stubb's BBQ. You can find it on the shelf in dozens of countries now. It's not quite the same as my dad's recipe, but it is a pretty spot-on shelf-stable, industrial kitchen version of it. \n\nIt's not like you put her apple pie on the shelves of every major grocer in substantial parts of North America. \n\nThere's nothing dishonorable or unfair about diligently reverse-engineering a recipe.

My cousin asked for it instead of a birthday cake every year, and got it until our grandmother passed away. People asked her all the time for the recipe, and she always refused, even her own daughters (she kept them out of the kitchen when she was making it, to maintain the secret).\nAfter she passed, we all thought the recipe was lost with her, no written recipe was found in her effects.

It took her about 10 years, working in secret from her family, until she succeeded, and unveiled the results for my cousin\u2019s birthday. At which point, unsurprisingly, people began asking her for the recipe, especially her son. My aunt was perhaps the most kind and generous soul I ever met, but she refused everyone who asked, including her son, saying that if she could recreate it, they could too if they really wanted it. After my mom, her younger sister, passed, I visited for one holiday (I think it was Thanksgiving), I casually asked whether she\u2019d made a pie for the meal.  She said yes, and then, without prompting, she said that she would like to give me the recipe, as I was always her favorite among the next generation, on the condition that I, too, would keep it secret. I was torn, because her son was my favorite cousin, and I would feel awful keeping it from him, but as this was something she really wanted, I accepted. \n\nA few months after she too passed, I sent my cousin the recipe on his birthday, the original in his mother\u2019s handwriting, as I knew it was something he\u2019d really want, even though I felt a little bad breaking my promise to her.

I think it makes OP an idiot more than an asshole here though.", "My first thought: She had a death scare, and you took that opportunity to replace her irreplaceable dessert?   Like, I completely see where op is coming from, but I genuinely lol\u2019d at how unintentionally AH it was. I\u2019m assuming op was genuine in having no Ill intent. But oh man. Lolz", ">And if OP was her daughter-in-law, I suspect she'd be much more willing to share the recipe, so that fucking sucks\n\nfwiw, I'm female and my partner's mom has recipes that she just won't share with me, so I don't think there's a good reason to assume it's a gender thing.\n\nI personally think it's weird, but some people are really that possessive about making the best pie (or whatever)  \n\n\nediting to add a judgement: tbh, it DID hurt my feelings at first when my partner's mom refused to share a recipe with me, but I can't imagine ever being so obsessed that I would attempt to reverse engineer it? Like, I recognized that it was A Thing with her, and I immediately and forever left it alone. It's a pretty big oversight that OP didn't see this coming...", "> And if OP was her daughter-in-law, I suspect she'd be much more willing to share the recipe, so that fucking sucks.\n\nFully 1/2 of Reddit is about how weird and hostile and competitive MILs are with their DILs lol", "I wonder if the wife really knew it was his reverse engineered version of her mother's pie, or if she thought her husband was bringing pie made from another recipe.", "I didn't say it was a brilliant idea. Just that his intentions were honest.", "I appreciate it. I enjoy learning the history behind things.", "My MiL used to share recipes by giving a copy and explaining where she got it. Sometimes it was from a box (like cornmeal), but many times from a neighbor or from her grandparents. It was a nifty way of honoring her family.", "Or she wills it/ her cookbook to someone the way my grandmother did.", "I'm glad you laughed about it haha MG mom has recipe books where she also glues stuff from back of cans, boxes and etc. :) very handy!", "My dad eyeballed it too. But I swear there was also some witchcraft involved. After he died, I got asked to bring it to potlucks but after the first couple tries, I started bringing something else because it frustrated me that it didn't taste right. Now my husband has a signature potluck dish that we bring.", "The sad thing is that people *is* that kind of stupid sometimes \ud83d\ude2d\n\nAnother saying I\u2019ve heard in spanish: *\u201dm\u00e1s da\u00f1o hace el tonto que el malo\u201d*.\n\n(\u201cMore damage does the stupid than the bad one\u201d).", "Based off some of OP\u2019s comments, I don\u2019t think he is as genuine as his post made him seem.\n\n> Sadly, this whole situation has kind of soured my view on cooking and baking for my in-laws.  I don't think I will be making anything for them any time soon.  My wife can figure out the cooking when it comes to her family.  We are supposed to host them for Thanksgiving and I think I might just take that day off and let them figure it out.\n\n> You're right, I shouldn't stoop to that level.  Maybe I can make them something extra special as an olive branch.  An apple pie, perhaps.", "Oh boy. I\u2019m the only one who cooks in my husband\u2019s family and they won\u2019t give me the sacred candy recipes. They (MIL and her sister) want my SIL to make the candy at Christmas or my husband to do it. Neither one wants to do it. But I can\u2019t have the recipes because I\u2019m not blood. \n\nI don\u2019t particularly care at this point, they\u2019re all 70\u2019s recipes that I\u2019ve found online.", "We've actually seen a [similar](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/i3087o/aita_for_recreating_a_secret_cookie_recipe_the/) story in this very forum in which the original baker definitely was **not** willing to share the recipe with a DIL. High-level takeaway: if someone adamantly refuses for whatever reason to share their signature recipe for years and years, don't expect them to give you applause and a gold star for your cleverness if you solve it on your own. OP is recipe-smart but people-dumb.", "No problem!", "I definitely should write stuff down. My family is of the type to never measure shit or write anything. Some of their food might die with me if I don\u2019t share it", "This was my instinct too. OP just skipped over the 10 minutes between stating he recreated the pie and being asked to leave. Whatever he did there and how he reacted to MIL being upset is crucial information. Was he gloating and smug ?  Super defensive on his high horse ? Very Apologetic ?\n\n\nSomething tells me be acted like an asshole in those 10 minutes. So much so his wife came home and told him he was an asshole and should have dropped it. Doesn't sound like this was *just* about the pie at all like OP was claiming. He's just trying to get people on his side. \n\n\nGlad for that edit admitting reddit thinks he's an asshole. Not very into getting feedback that doesn't fit his narrative.", "My question is why can't he just apologize to MIL? How is this worth causing strife in the family? Unless it was intentional.", "Idk, I think coming here to win fake internet points and get strangers on his side is more important than mending fences with hurting elderly relatives. Sad.", "Yeah, I'm more surprised by the F that old lady and her having feelings mentality. Is the recipe thing stupid? Sure. Is it important to her? Yes. If it's important to her,  then it should be important to op, as he is a part of the family.  I would never want to upset my MIL like that. It is so obviously a bad move."]}
