I have 2 sons (15 & 13) while my wife has a daughter, Jade, (18).  Jade just turned 18 in December and now has an attitude of \"I'm an adult now and can do whatever I want.\"  She's been staying out late at night on weekends, staying out late on weeknights, skipping out on household duties etc.  \n\nFor the most part, I let my wife handle Jade since she's not my daughter and Jade has made it very clear to me she doesn't view me or want me as a parental figure.  But there is one house rule that I have that Jade has been breaking that I want my wife to enforce.  \n\nJade has a BF that she's been with for 2 years.  Ever since they started dating, we have had a \"No sleepover\" rule and that BF has to leave at midnight on weekends and 10pm on weeknights.  Well, since Jade has turned 18, she's been pushing us on that rule every single time that BF is over at our house.  \n\nThis has caused a lot of tension not only between Jade, my wife and I, but also with my sons because they are seeing how Jade is behaving and pushing back against their own rules.  I've talked with my wife about how Jade's behavior is negatively affecting the entire family, but she is refusing to do anything about it because, in my wife's words, \"Jade is an adult now so it's not like we can punish her.\"  \n\nWhich, sure, Jade is an adult.  But she's still living in our house and, in my opinion, if she wants to act and be treated like an adult, she is going to have adult expectations and responsibilities.  I told my wife that if Jade wants to act this way then I expect her to contribute to the household both monetarily and with household duties.  \n\nThis past weekend my wife was away visiting her mom and Jade's BF was at our house.  They were watching a movie in the living room around 1030pm when I was getting ready for bed and I reminded them that BF has to leave after the movie.  Even though it was dark, I could see Jade's eyes roll nearly to the back of her head.  \n\n Sure enough, when I woke up in the morning, Jade's BF's car was still at our house.  I knocked on her door and told her that BF has to leave right now.  A few minutes later, Jade came out of her room furious with me.  She yelled that I'm not her dad and she's not a kid anymore so I can't tell her what to do.   \n\nI told her that if she wants to act like an adult then she's going to be treated like one.  I told her if she wants to live by her own rules, she can either move out, or start paying rent and keeping up with all household chores.  I told her that she needs to either follow house rules, or the expectations for her to continue living with us are going to drastically change.\n\nWhen my wife got home it was a huge fight between the 3 of us.  My main point is that I will enforce these same rules on my kids and if Jade isn't going to follow house rules, we are going to have to change the conditions of her living with us.", "created_utc": 1673296899, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/107pd38/aita_for_wanting_my_wife_to_enforce_rules_on_her/", "score": 505, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because it doesn\u2019t seem like your wife is in agreement with the rules based on the post and just because you want something doesn\u2019t mean it has to be a house rule. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unfair to have a rule about overnight guests but it does need to be agreed on between both parents if it\u2019s a house rule. This post really reads as my way or the highway and it might just be a lack of details but that\u2019s not a great attitude for a family dynamic. \n\nYou\u2019ve also set a previous precedent of your wife handling Jade which is fair but it means Jade is probably more likely to listen to her mother than you which makes it even more important to get on the same page with your wife. Like another commenter said you guys really need to talk it all out and come up with age appropriate rules for Jade", "NTA.  Yeah, she's an adult.  But she's also a member of a household and that entails respecting the rules and respecting the other members of the household.\n\nIt's not always reasonable to enforce the same rules on kids of different ages.  Example, you wouldn't expect your teenagers to have a bedtime you would want a toddler to have.  In this instance, it's entirely reasonable to enforce the curfew.\n\nYour wife is partly right.  She can't necessarily \"punish\" her daughter.   But she can make it difficult for the daughter to continue living there if she continues to disrespect the rules.", "ESH.

The two of you need to come to agreement on things regarding Jade and what she is and is not allowed and required to do as an adult living in your (collective) home.  As for your boys, you tell them to mind their own business since neither are adults, this situation doesn\u2019t apply to them (yet).", "INFO It would be fair for an older child to have different rules than younger kids. Can you and your wife agree on rules for jade? No sleepovers is fair when they are in high school if a discussion has been had with Jade about why the rule exists. The way things are now is obviously an issue.", "I have never understood the idea that people are suddenly adults in all manners once they hit their 18th birthday. \n\nThere is a lot of parenting, teaching, and coaching that helps kids be adults or at least adult like by the time they are 18.  \n\nIf your stepdaughter behaved as an adult, she would understand the basics;  don't bite the hand that feeds you - in this case, you and her mother and treat your housemates with respect. \n\nShe wants all the privilege of adulthood with the responsibility.  Good luck to that. She needs more guidance and parenting. \n\n NTA", "ESH.\n\nYou and your wife need to agree on house rules. You don't get to unilaterally set rules for everyone to follow in the home that you share. Neither does she. You can't set rules without her agreement, and she's can't overrule you on her own.\n\nThat said, whatever the two of you agree to enforce as house rules need to be enforced as house rules. Maybe that will become \"no one under 18 can have guests after midnight.\"\n\nIt's clear you want it to be \"no one but OP and wife can have guests after midnight\" or \"no one not paying mortgage / rent can have guests after midnight.\" But that whole \"paying rent\" thing could turn into your sons volunteering to start paying rent once they have part time jobs and incomes of their own. So be careful how you word the rules.\n\nMy kids have been raised with the expectation that, if they find the household rules too onerous, they are welcome to move out when they turn 18. They don't get to simply ignore the rules. Perhaps your wife agrees with that mindset. Perhaps not.\n\nYou should talk to her before trying to enforce rules for Jade to follow.", "NTA.

Cause afaik that's only a thing parents impose on kids.", "YTA (and your wife)\n\nYes, as an \"adult\" living with other adults, Jade should be - at the very least - contributing to chores and following house rules.

You and her mom are not on the same page, and she's listening to her mom because she doesn't see you as a parental figure.   \n\n\nYou're not the asshole for being uncomfortable with a new person sleeping in your home or for wanting everyone in the house to pull their weight, but you're absolutely the asshole for taking a \"my house my rules\" approach when it is not YOUR house, it's you AND YOUR WIFE'S house. Now figure out what you AND YOUR WIFE'S rules are. You know your stepdaughter isn't going to listen to you, so stop antagonizing her and TALK TO YOUR WIFE. You have a right to set rules in your home, but you lost unilateral control over your home when you married and formed a blended family.

But as a former extremely rebellious teenager/young adult, I\u2019ll warn you that the no sleepovers rule may result in her taking unnecessary risks. This rule was enforced when I was her age, and it resulted in explicit behaviour in outdoor, unsavoury places. At 18, it\u2019s extremely likely that she is engaging in sexual behaviour, and it is much safer, not to mention sanitary, for this to be in the comfort of her home.\n\nThat being said, her attitude, while not exactly uncommon at her age, is disrespectful and will probably continue indefinitely if she\u2019s not challenged. Your wife sounds scared of confronting her daughter, and that\u2019s worrying. Finding boundaries with a child who has just reached adulthood can be difficult and overwhelming, but she needs to come to an agreement about house rules with you and enforce them with her daughter. Now she\u2019s an adult, adjusting house rules to reflect that isn\u2019t unreasonable, but you should both have input on what her new rules are.\n\nOn a side note, if she\u2019s working, not in education, and not saving every spare penny to move out, paying rent and having assigned chores is perfectly reasonable.\n\nEdited to clarify.", "NTA, wife unilaterally changed the rules. < - added after info obtained.\n\nINFO: is it the house rule or is it YOUR rule that YOU unilaterally imposed on everyone?

She's lived most of her life without you or your rules, she didn't pick you, but now you're trying to be in control of her.\n\nEdit: Lot of \"My house my rules\" comments with no evidence it isn't an equally owned house, or the wifes. So where does \"my house my rules\" fit in if it isn't even OPs house? It's control for controls sake. Also you don't solve conflicts by using loss of a safe living environment as a threat.", "NTA \n\nIt seems like you and your wife are struggling with how to handle your stepdaughter's behavior since she turned 18. You mentioned that she has been staying out late, skipping household duties, and pushing back against your house rules. This is causing tension within the family and affecting your sons as well.\n\nIt is important to establish and enforce clear expectations and boundaries within the household. It is reasonable to expect your stepdaughter to follow the same rules as your sons, especially if she is living in your house.\n\nOne option may be to have a family meeting to discuss the changes in your stepdaughter's behavior and the impact it is having on the family. During this meeting, you can discuss the expectations and boundaries for all members of the household and the consequences for not following them. It may also be helpful to involve a mediator or therapist to facilitate the conversation and help you find a resolution that works for everyone.\n\nRemember, your stepdaughter is now an adult and it may be difficult for her to adjust to the changes in her responsibilities and expectations. It may be helpful to have open and honest communication with her about your concerns and to listen to her perspective as well.", "My dad and stepmother constantly fought over how the other treated all of us kids.  It ended up very poorly. \n\nMy mom and stepdad had agreed upon house rules, and when discipline was needed, she did it unless one of us went off the rails. This worked out much better. \n\nRecommendation: you and your wife sit down and reiterate house rules with all kids. Adulthood doesn't come without rules and consequences. And \"you're not my dad\" needs to be addressed by your wife now, before your kids turn on her in a similar fashion. \n\nYour stepdaughter is treating you poorly, and will keep on doing so as long as your wife wimps out on correcting her.

You all are confusing the law of being naturally emancipated, and in some states it's actually not until 21, with biology.  \n\nShe is not an adult. That fact she tried to slide this in while her mother wasn't there, shows her maturity level. And should show when you choose to become a bonus parent to a child, you have to act like her parent. Or when they gets older, they'll have no respect for you. That's why she tried to play this card with the dad.", "NTA. The biggest issue here is not that Jade isn\u2019t following the rules; it\u2019s that your wife is allowing her to treat you with disrespect because you\u2019re not her biological father. Now, there\u2019s nothing wrong with her not seeing you as her dad, every kid has a different relationship with their step parents, but regardless of age, when Jade is in your home, she should treat you with respect. \n\nUltimately, this is between you and your wife, and while Jade may be 18, per the comments, she\u2019s still in high school and likely shouldn\u2019t have unlimited freedom yet.", "NTA.

I've talked with my wife about how Jade's behavior is negatively affecting the entire family, but she is refusing to do anything about it because, in my wife's words, \"Jade is an adult now so it's not like we can punish her.\"  \n\nWhich, sure, Jade is an adult.  But she's still living in our house and, in my opinion, if she wants to act and be treated like an adult, she is going to have adult expectations and responsibilities.  I told my wife that if Jade wants to act this way then I expect her to contribute to the household both monetarily and with household duties.  \n\nThis past weekend my wife was away visiting her mom and Jade's BF was at our house.  They were watching a movie in the living room around 1030pm when I was getting ready for bed and I reminded them that BF has to leave after the movie.  Even though it was dark, I could see Jade's eyes roll nearly to the back of her head.  \n\n Sure enough, when I woke up in the morning, Jade's BF's car was still at our house.  I knocked on her door and told her that BF has to leave right now.  A few minutes later, Jade came out of her room furious with me.  She yelled that I'm not her dad and she's not a kid anymore so I can't tell her what to do.   \n\nI told her that if she wants to act like an adult then she's going to be treated like one.  I told her if she wants to live by her own rules, she can either move out, or start paying rent and keeping up with all household chores.  I told her that she needs to either follow house rules, or the expectations for her to continue living with us are going to drastically change.\n\nWhen my wife got home it was a huge fight between the 3 of us.  My main point is that I will enforce these same rules on my kids and if Jade isn't going to follow house rules, we are going to have to change the conditions of her living with us.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Sleepovers are permitted ***ONLY*** ***if they ask first and*** ***both parents agree***. The only exception is if someone was drinking/using weed. At that point, they either stay in a guest room/on the couch, or they call an uber.\n3. Mutual respect. You don't have to see her as a daughter, and she doesn't need to see you as a father. But she needs to respect you as the homeowner and you need to continue to respect her as an adult.\n4. You, your wife, and your kids all need to sit down once a month and talk about the house rules. If anyone has any concerns about any rules, you all discuss them and come to a compromise.\n\nThis behavior of being on opposite sides, disrespecting the home owners, neglecting your kid who is still in high school.

There's 0 reason for you to treat a 13, 15 and 18 year old exactly the same. When your boys reach the age of consent, are you going to ban them? I suspect not. And you cannot prove that you intend to, because that decision is 3 and 6 years away. You aren't comparing like with like.  It's reasonable for an 18 year old to have a partner over, and it's easy enough to tell your 13 year old or 15 year old \"look, age of consent and adulthood is 18, you can have someone over when you're a grown up\". There's zero need to treat her like a fifteen year old.  \n\n\nYou're entitled to discuss it with her mum and agree a rule together - though you really should have had that discussion before she turned 18.

The difference is were respectful, honor roll students, took school seriously, and always did chores - even at each others houses.\n\nIt\u2019s probably time to decide with your wife if you are going to keep this rule, or if you want to alter the rule to say weekend sleepovers are ok if chores, grades, and attendance are maintained.

No sleepover that weekend.\n\nSure, maybe Jade can move out, but is that really the best solution?

OP is very much into treating her as if she is still a child. \n\nIf she lived with him until she was 35, would he STILL be saying she can't have her boyfriend of multiple years over? \n\nIf they don't let him stay over, Jade and her BF are just going to fuck during the day, in the backseat or somewhere less savory. Being controlling doesn't stop grown adults from having sex.", "I mean sure but maybe the wife feels that once someone is 18 that rule shouldn't apply anymore therefore she and OP do need another discussion on it.\n\nI.e. if OP assumed that rule lasted for as long as someone lived in their house but his wife assumed it was just until the child reached adulthood.", "No one said they were doing anything and jade isn\u2019t Ops kids and he doesn\u2019t get to decide the rules and regulations of someone else\u2019s kid when the parent doesn\u2019t agree.

You two need to sit down and talk because what is being shown is disrespect. Not just to you, to your sons and to your wife.

They can also try solving the situation? OP and his wife should start by deciding what the rules will be. You can say Jade is rebelling, but if the mom allows it, then she's just doing what she's been told she can do. If she's been told 'sure, you can set your own times and have people over' then it's not weird that she'd do that. \n\nSure, if they have clear rules and she says 'fuck these' and keeps breaking them, *then*   it would be reasonable to say move out.", "This is poor logic, by your logic the OP should move out if he doesn't like the rules NOT being enforced by his wife, the other home owner.

Listen here lady, this is MY house and MY rules, obey my orders or GTFO!\".   \n\n\nIt could definitely be a learning point and a sensible conversation, but the actual parental figures have let their emotions get the better of them and have allowed this to become a screaming match where he tries to impose rules, rather than  a mature discussion.   \n\n\nParents lead by example.

That would be opposed to the possibility the wife feels the rule should change now her daughter is 18, which isn't the same as her not wanting to enforce them, and her say in the house rules would be equal to OPs.", "It seems they should find a middle ground.

She knows the boyfriend rule and still breaks it every chance she gets but because she\u2019s 18 it\u2019s fine? Nah.
