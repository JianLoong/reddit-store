This was at a small wedding with only family members and close friends present so everyone already knew his family issues. I was very sceptical of him when we were dating solely because of his family situation but took a leap of faith but clearly I should have anticipated this happening eventually.\n\nHis father abandoned the family, his mother is an alcoholic and on oxygen but smokes like a chimney. She is only 58 and already in an nursing home/psych ward because of her issues. His sister he basically raised so I understand he felt like he should help her. We had an agreement we would contribute 70% of our income into a joint account and that would be savings and family and 30% would be toward our own hobbies and things. I mostly save my money but I told my husband he can save that money, spend it or help his sister with it whatever but never to touch the joint money. She was a troubled teen, ran away, drank and is probably an alcoholic, got pregnant (but didn\u2019t keep it), got into and still is struggling with drugs. I don\u2019t know what my husband does for her or really I don\u2019t want to know. When I get involved with his family it\u2019s just a disaster. He always complains about his family but when I say anything he gets defensive so I keep out of it to keep our marriage intact. \n\nRecently she got into trouble with the law and my husband wants to withdraw some money from the joint account as a bail money. I know there are services that put up the money for you but you have to pay a percentage of it to them. But turns out he has no money in his own account and her bail was set at 80,000 so he would need to pay something like 10,000 as a fee. He said it was just drug possession but I am doubtful because of how high the bail is. With how much groceries are it\u2019s not like our saving are infinite and I told him I won\u2019t allow or joint account to be accessed and he threw a fit saying his sister is like his kid and I\u2019m heartless for not helping. He doesn\u2019t even help out with our son as much as his sister and we all live together. Honestly this is the main thing that I was worried about with marrying him and now I\u2019m questioning my leap of faith.", "created_utc": 1696015099, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16vkn7b/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_mil_with_bail/", "score": 162, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your husband is in denial that things with his sister are not resolving, they are escalating.  And his enabling of her is probably a key factor in things continuing to escalate.  \n\nThere are only two likely outcomes here:  you deny him the money and things come to a head now OR you allow him to take the money, he drains all your savings, and things come to a head later when there is nothing left for you or your son.  But this conflict is coming either way because eventually things will escalate with SIL to a point where your husband cannot bail her out.  You can hold firm and make that time now, or you can wait until it happens because there's no money to bail her out with anymore.  Your only real choice is whether or not there's still money in the accounts for you and your son when that happens.\n\nHold firm.  If this goes south, at least with the way things are currently, you have the resources to separate and take care of your son.", "Hey there, I know this is a stressful time for you because you want your husband to be happy and this is causing stress on your relationship. You are 100% NTA. That joint account is YOURS as well. It may seem like he is trying to help his sister, but there comes a point when helping turns into enabling and that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing. My family member (won\u2019t say who) was arrested and begged me to pay for their bail and begged me to ask others. However, the best thing to do was to let them sit in jail for a little so they can feel and really understand the consequences of their actions. If you post bail and throw 10k around like nothing she will be more likely to do bad things and expect you guys to help out again.\n\nAgain, NTA. Your husband may not agree with you, but sometimes enabling is disguised as helping. Good luck to you, and I hope you guys come to an understanding.\n\nEdit: If your husband really loves her, he will not enable her to do the same things again. She will be angry and fight back and call names (maybe), but this may be for the best.", "NTA. Bailing her out so she can go right back to doing what she was arrested for?\n\nPerhaps some jail time will make her think about things.\n\nETA: He will dip into the joint account and he will have a legal right to do so, even to drain it completely - whether it's now or later, it's going to happen. I'd be making provisions for a separate account that he doesn't have access to. He agreed to keep the joint separate from his \"black hole\" of a family and now he wants to break that agreement.", "NTA\n\nAll boundaries were predetermined.  Hubby spent all his side money; the joint account is off limits.  Calling you heartless is absolutely out of line, you are protecting your family.    People like your sister-in-law will drain everything you have and still never get better.  You may want to re-evaluate your choices with marrying into this family.", "What state are you in? In some states you don't get the bail bond money back at all. You either post the full bail and get it back after the trial, or you post a bond and the bondsman keeps it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This is an agreed upon joint fund.  Why does he want to bail her out? It sounds as if she needs to suffer the consequences of her actions like she never has before. His responsibility is to his wife and child 1st. Family second. That changed the moment he got married. This is NOT a child and even if it was my child they would still sit in there unless it was something the actually didn't do. And based on your description of past behavior she probably did do it. FYI in my county, quite often bail is higher for repeat offenders, especially for harder drugs like meth, heroin fyntenal.  He and you both probably need some therapy so he can work through his issues.", "Hmm, so your husband says his sister is like his kid? So when is he going to take on the parental task of disciplining her? Let him pay with his own money he earned, if he wants. But don\u2019t take anything you invested. **NTA**", "Absolutely NTA. She got herself into this mess, and she can get herself out. Tell him if he touches one penny of the joint money, you are ending the marriage. He knew the rules well ahead of time.", "NTA. Couples counseling may be in order if this difficulty with family boundaries continues to be an issue.", "NTA. Your husband could very well drain your joint account because he has access to it. Bailing her out isn't going to make her suddenly toe the line. And you will end up losing that $10,000 if she fails to appear in court. Are you willing to eat $10,000 for a f\\*ckup?", "NTA - sounds like jail and sobriety might be good for her to be honest", "NTA.\n\nHe agreed that the joint acct money would *not* go towards helping his family. \n\nA bail of 80K means this was a serious offense, far more serious than your husband is saying (you should be able to find out for sure by looking it up in the police blotter).\n\nHold firm in this, because you may never see that money again.", "NTA. Stick to your guns. Your husband is thinking only with his heart, not using his head at all. Addicts of any stripe are a bad bet for bail. And what happens if she skips out on it? You'll be on the hook for the whole 80K not just the 10K. Also 80K bail, if it's for drugs is pretty serious, this isn't just a possession rap. She's probably looking at some serious time. Thus the 80K, thus the flight risk. Do not do this. I don't agree with the war on drugs, but she's got only herself to blame for being caught up in it and there is absolutely no way you and your husband should risk you and your kids becoming financial collateral damage. Good luck!", "NTA. She won\u2019t ever stop if he keeps enabling her. Maybe some time in jail will help straighten her out.", "NTA - he\u2019s spiraling because of the unhealthy dynamic of his family and this should be your hill to die on. \n\n\u201cNo, you vowed and promised to protect our family from your extended family toxicity. Your sister made her choices and you\u2019re not responsible for her making it. \n\nI am not heartless and that is emotionally manipulative for you to say so, I am protecting our actual kid, our actual family which you are putting secondary to someone who has repeatedly made bad choices. You know how she was and you had money you could have saved, but you chose not too thinking I would cave to nail her out. I won\u2019t. \n\nThis will always be a no, and if you try to put her before your actual child again, I will consider this grounds to reevaluate our marriage as you\u2019re not willing to protect our family and our child who is an actual child needing their father.\u201d", "NTA. This is a hill to die on, because it will never end until your husband stops enabling his sister. He needs counseling so that he can tell when his good intentions will continue to result in bad outcomes, and so that he can learn to really help his sister rather than making himself feel better by \u2018doing something\u2019.", "NTA but if you are both on that account, there\u2019s nothing but his own morals keeping him from withdrawing the money anyways. You are absolutely in the right. If you start, it\u2019s going to be money for a lawyer because PD isn\u2019t good enough, it\u2019s the fees, it\u2019s her violating conditions and going back to jail, then putting money in commissary - the seal needs to stay in so that this doesn\u2019t become the default.", "NTA- sounds like she needs some time away to get herself off the drugs. Sounds like he needs to get some therapy and stop enabling his sister.", "op=nta but it seems that you meant SIL in title not MIL\n\nHold hard line and maybe pull your share of money out of joint account(so you know you'll have it to pay bills).  \n\nIF he uses joint money/account to pay her bail, you have answer.  Do not put any more money in joint account(pay directly from your own for your share of bills).  Also you will need to get counseling or go straight to attorney--Only you know how much trust you are willing to extend if he betrays you.\n\nAnd 10K will be a huge betrayal if you are a normal family who lives with just minimal savings.(sounds like of the two only YOU have savings).  Also make sure he has NO way to access your personal account(debit card/password/checks)", "You say yourself you knew he had \"family issues\" enough to get hm to swear not to let them affect his union with you.\n\nAnd you believed him? Never in the history of families from the days of Eden did a family doormat even attempt to resist the thrill of wasting money on family issues.\n\nYou now have what you created. Your only chance is to take the joint account money away before he does.", "NTA\n\nIf he takes any money from the joint account for his sister, immediately close the joint account and refuse to get another.  \n\nAlso, if he pays the 10% and the rest of the bond is put up by a bailm bondsman, would your husband be legally liable for the balance if his sister doesn't attend her court date?\n\nLastly, there's no way the court set an $80k bail for a simple drug possession.  She's probably dealing.  You may be able to look up this current case and her arrest history on the Internet.", "\"Just a drug possession\"???\n\nUmm no. If it's drug charges, with a bail that high it's probably at least trafficking.  Or she has a veeeeeeery long record already.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>***\"...he threw a fit saying his sister is like his kid...\"***\n\nHis kid who is, apparently, a felon.\n\nNTA.", "INFO: can you afford to lose $80,000?", "NAH I don't think he's wrong for wanting to help his sister, even if it might be a bad idea to actually do it; things are probably always going to be complex for him when it comes to his family and their problems unless he's had a lot of therapy. I also think it makes a lot of sense that you would want to draw a boundary around your own family and take care of them (financially and otherwise) first and do any helping out of your abundance not out of the resources you've determined you need for yourselves. \n\nIf you really wanted to be supportive of him, you could offer money from your 30% reserve fund, I guess. But I also don't think you'd be the AH for just flat out saying no I don't want this in my life. Most people with addiction issues need to start making headway on solving their own problems and don't really get better until they do that. If she's not working on her addiction or participating in solving her own legal problems, then bailing her out is just enabling, not help. You might want to both consider going to Al-Anon.", "Drain the account before he does. Give him his half to waste. Get out of there.", "I have 3 children and I have always told them that my love is unconditional, no matter what they do I will never stop loving them and will always try to help.\n\nMy mantra with my kids is I can open the door for you but I can't walk through it you have to do that yourself (I also use the if Elle Woods can get into Harvard you can do it (random thing))\n\nYour husband can't help her if she doesn't want help, and maybe this will be her rock bottom. \n\nI think your husband also needs therapy he'll have trauma that he isn't addressing and thinks he can just push it away in doing so he'll only realise when it too late he's lots you and his kid.\n\nGood luck.", "I think you are wise to refuse. You need to know a lot more about the details on this. It's easy to end up enabling someone like this. That's actually the opposite of helping. It's allowing them to continue to make bad choices.\n\nThen there's the whole agreement on what to do with jointly saved money. This request clearly violates that. I see it as your call whether or not an exception is a good idea so NTA here.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would insist on looking into all the details. Find out exactly what the charges are and the circumstances she was found in when she was arrested. That includes the amount of drugs and her state. Then talk to someone who does work with people in her situation as a counselor to find out what they advise. \n\nIf that's not an option, there should be local support groups for parents and family of those dealing with addiction. There's nar-anon for one. There may be others in your town that aren't 12 step specific. They can give you some ideas as to how to approach this in a healthy way as well. Talk to more than one parent/sibling though as you'll get different opinions based on their experience.\n\nThis is a LOT of work to do but it's probably warranted given the amount of money, the situation and your husband's concerns. If he's not willing to take the time, you are free to say no since you don't have all the facts.", "NTA\u2026get that money out of your joint account now!!!  Legally, if both your names are in the account, he can withdraw whatever he wants to from the account.  Protect yourself and your son.", "NAH", "NTA, but better to pay the $10,000 and be done with it. Otherwise there is an excelle t chance you will be out $80,000 bwcause he will bail her out anyway, which means you are betting $80,000 on a drug addict.

Possibly at the expense (literally) of you and your son.\n\nIf he cannot act rationally, you will have to. Get your current bank to provide history of the account to prove the longstanding contributions you both made to the joint account. *Do not touch anything that he contributed,* to protect against any accusations he might make of bad faith against you.\n\nBe warned, this action will probably be the final nail in your marriage, so be honest with yourself over whether or not your trust in your husband's financial decisions is already ruined by this point.\n\nFor what it's worth, I detest immediately crying DIVORCE in this sub. But this sort of financial risk your husband is asking of you can ruin your life.", "Are you questioning not giving him the money or marrying him in the first place? You are completely in the right in this situation if not giving him the money is the issue. That money is for your family, not his sister.\n\nNTA", "Take your part of the joint account out now and move it to a separate account with just you having access to it.", "Tell him he\u2019s going back on his promise and if you can\u2019t trust him, you have no marriage. He\u2019s hurting his sister by enabling so he\u2019s really not doing a good thing. NTA", "He's acting rashly, stupidly and going back on his promises, I'm not adding much there. \n\nThat said, arrest records are public information, and you can probably look up the charges on the public jail portal for your county. You can also probably call any bail agency, provide her name and they'll be able to tell you the charges, which are what sets the bail amount.", "You cannot change a lifetime of behavior. He's been bailing them out for years, probably without your knowledge. But you are certain to notice if he took all of your savings. My question is this.. do you trust him not to touch the money? I would get online create a new bank account your name only and transfer most of the money over to preempt anything he might be considering. The reason he has no money in his accounts may be because he's been bailing her out of trouble for a long time."]}
