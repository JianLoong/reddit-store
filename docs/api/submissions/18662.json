{"id": 18662, "submission_id": "13x1k5k", "title": "AITA for not wanting my fiance's other child over the week after I give birth?", "selftext": "My fiance and I have been together for a little more than a year plus. 2 months into the relationship he and I found out together that he had a surprise child because the mom never told him she was pregnant and her mom was the one to text him saying that her daughter was giving birth to his kid right at that moment if he wanted to be there. We waited for a paternity test and sure enough 2 months after that it was confirmed that he had a daughter. I never resented this and actually really like her. I've never met the mom and don't plan on it for awhile so there is zero drama there. I help watch her and raise her when we have her every Wednesday night and every other weekend. \n\nMy issue is that 6 months into our relationship I found out I was pregnant. Currently I have about 6 weeks to go until I pop. I told him the other day that the week I go into labor and return home with him and our son, I don't want his daughter here for at least a week. I also said if I give birth in let's say a Thursday, I really don't want him to leave that weekend and go pick up his daughter. I feel like all of his attention would elsewhere and he'd have to be gone with her while I'm at the hospital. A few of my reasons are is she's extremely fussy and can only be calmed down when being held by him 24/7. She's also a huge screamer. I just don't see how we're going to be able to get our newborn settled and him ( my fiance ) be able to take care of our son if she needs constant care during her time here. Again, I love her and have known her the same amount of time he's known her. I just don't know how it would work while I'm healing in stitches and our son and his daughter are crying all at once. I won't mind the juggle once I'm more healed. He doesn't really seem to understand this though and said he only sees half of my reasoning as valid. AITA? I just feel as though a not even 1 1/2 year old and a newborn would be too much all at once for at least the beginning stretch. Not sure how selfish I'm being and maybe it's just my anxiety. I'm 21 and this is my first child myself so I don't have anything to go off of and just want all the uninterrupted support I can have for at least the first week. \n\nEdit: to just explain myself a bit further I'm getting a lot of people saying I'm not accepting her and that couldn't be further from the truth. I myself was born of a one night stand and we almost broke up purely because I wanted him to focus solely on her. I love her and when we get married that is my daughter as well. I have been here the entire time helping raise her and I think it's a bit presumptuous for people to think I'm asking him to pay attention to only my son and I. I only asked that the week I give birth she stay with her mother that extra day or two. Not give her up for life\n\nEdit 2 : after reading everything I saw this post reach a sort of consensus but also ingesting the advice of maybe asking a family member to help, I went ahead with trying to talk with him about it again. It did not go well. He got pretty upset with me and said he doesn't want to disrupt her schedule and balancing two babies will be his cross to bear and he will figure it out. Hearing that just stressed me out because I don't even want things to get bad enough to a point we have to call for emergency help. I'm more of a plan beforehand and have 3 back up plans type of person. He doesn't even want to set a plan up for someone maybe watching her if we need it until it's an emergency at the time. I also just don't really see it being unreasonable to want to have that attention on me and our child for that single week. As many said, my future step daughter has a support system of having two sets of grandparents and a biological mother that doesn't work. I don't really see the problem in asking that just for the first week I have time to get settled and used to my new life. Another issue that I didn't bring up in this original post but in the comments, he is about to leave on a 10 day trip half way across the country while I am heavily pregnant and his daughter will be with her mom that entire time. I feel pretty put down knowing that it's ok in that situation for her to stay there but while I'm literally healing from birth I can't ask for a single week of peace in knowing everyone is being taken care of properly. His response was to ask me if I expected him to take her with him on his vacation and I ofc replied no. But I don't see how that's acceptable but this isn't and he said it's because he will be out of state vs. him being in the same state. He said it all rides on what actually happens. How the birth goes, what day of the week it is on, and if he deems he actually needs help. I just don't see our just turned 1 year old, newborn, and me in the process of healing being able to be juggled all at once. I'm very torn. I understand his side and that he wants to keep the schedule they have set. It just hurts that it's ok to change the schedule when it benefits him. Also the mom has asked multiple times throughout the year for us to watch the baby unplanned or to keep her extra days. Sometimes for a family party, other times for medical reasons. I don't see why my medical reason is any less. I also am just an emotional wreck now though so I could be overthinking it. I've been pretty open with ingesting the I'm an asshole comments. Some have fair points. I'm really trying to see things from his view. I just wish he'd see them from mine too.", "created_utc": 1685575278, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13x1k5k/aita_for_not_wanting_my_fiances_other_child_over/", "score": 292, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA.\n\nYou're not telling your fianc\u00e9 to get rid of his other child. You're asking for one week while you recover from childbirth and adjust to having the new baby. He has her on Wednesdays and every other weekend, so you're really only asking for ~3 days, depending on timing. I don't think that's unreasonable. How is it any different from if he had to travel for work or something and her mother needed to keep her for that whole week?", "NTA\n\nI have such a big family, when my cousin gave birth to her 3rd child, her mum drove down an hour from where she lived to pick up the older two kids and take them back to her house for a few days, just so my cousin and her partner could rest a little and get settled in. \n\nShe isn't asking to not parent  his fiance's child ever again for crying out loud, her fiance's child has been a part of their family from the beginning and she has been great with it, and will continue to be a part of the family, she is just asking for a little time with her newborn and him for a few days, possibly a week. \n\nIf you have the family to do it, it's not completely out of the ordinary to have someone from the family look after your other kids while you settle in with a newborn for a little bit.\n\nShe's young and it's her first child, can we give her break?", "NTA. Having a newborn is stressful enough already. You already will be exhausted with the newborn alone. Grandparents or other family members should take his kids so you can focus on you and your newborns health and wellbeing", "NTA. It's not like OP is asking to stop caring for fiance kid altogether. She just wants 1 week to settle down with the new baby, which doesnt seem that unreasonable to me. \n\nWhile you cant choose to just stop caring for 1 child over the other, you're also a new parent. As long as the little toddler will be cared for by her mom or other relative, then shouldn't just one week away be fine?", "NTA. You might be if you had asked like six months but a week or even a month while you\u2019re healing and getting used to a new baby is understandable. Even with biological children some parents choose to have their older child stay with grandparents at the beginning so the mom can heal and everyone has an easier time adjusting", "Info: what will you do when you get pregnant again?  Kick out both other kids for a week?", "NAH. The end of pregnancy is a pretty scary and anxious time, and your brain goes into overdrive trying to think of how to make things as easy as possible. But I will say, for me and lots of my mom friends the adjustment period was more like a month or so after birth, not right after (minus c-section recovery which was tough). But you\u2019re kind of on a \u201cpost-birth high\u201d for a little while and trying to find your new normal is fun and exciting. But after a few weeks that wears off, and the fatigue and other issues crop up and make things a little tougher. All that to say, I wouldn\u2019t keep his daughter away as it will be best to integrate and deal with life the way it\u2019ll realistically be right from the start. Things will likely go smoother than you\u2019re anticipating. But you\u2019re NTA for having this feeling and discussing it with your partner, or even if that\u2019s what you decide to do. \n\nBest of luck and congratulations!", "This is very tricky. On one hand, this is his daughter, he needs to be there for her. On the other hand you need a little extra attention. \nMaybe, talk to the other baby\u2019s mother, and ask if she wouldn\u2019t mind cutting the visit a little short. \nPlease don\u2019t demand this of either of them. You don\u2019t need to cause unnecessary drama. NTA for wanting the small break.", "I don't think the request is unreasonable honestly, having two young children is really difficult even if you aren't healing from giving birth. You need his support right now, his daughter isn't gonna remember this when she's older. NTA", "YTA\n\nYou don't just hit pause on existing kids and parenting when you have a new one. \"Can we parent the existing kids and a new one too?\" is the kind of question you ask and answer before deciding to have another baby.", "NTA\n\nHis daughter has another caregiver, the mother. She will be in perfectly good hands. It's not like it's both of your children. Asking for less distractions is reasonable. Also lots of parents who are having their second child together, will send their first child together to the grands or something.  I might suggest a compromise if he still wants to hang out with his daughter. Have you talked to him about it?", "YTA\n\nI hate to say it but it sounds like you just want your fiance to focus on YOU and YOUR son and not HIS daughter. Like you want him focused on his \"new\" family. You need to change that attitude and start treating that little girl like she's a part of your family too. Especially since once you get married, that little girl is your step-daughter.\n\nJuggling another child with a newborn has been done by many, many people so its not a new concept. Some even have to juggle two or more newborn babies at once! I know as a new mom it can be stressful, but you kinda did the baby thing with his daughter already no? Maybe not to the same extent but at least you have some experience.\n\nIf you want / need support after your pregnancy, is it possible for your mom / sister / aunt or someone to help you out for a week or two? Its really not fair of you to ask your fiance to stay away from his daughter for a week or more.", "NTA\n\nNot remotely selfish. Barring some emergency with his daughter's mom, there is no reason for him to have her for a long stretch your first few days until you settle in.", "YTA.\n\nDo you think most people send their older kids away for a week when they give birth?", "YTA he comes with the kid no matter if convenient or not.", "NTA.  Just to ask, can you get some support from other family members while you recuperate (i.e., your mom, a sister)?", "Y\u2019all are ridiculous! Let this lady have one week to heal and be with her child. She already gave reasons- which are completely understandable. And 2days isn\u2019t going to kill the daughter. She\u2019s so young she wouldn\u2019t even understand. Stop being so dramatic and let OP have some peace with her nb baby for a few days. She doesn\u2019t even live with them full time or 50/50. It\u2019s 3 days IF delivery falls on their weekend to have her. 1 day if it doesn\u2019t. Its not that serious! YOU ARE NOT THE AH mama. These commenters are tho. Smh", "YTA you can't just do away with the kid when it's not convenient for you, that's not how families work", "NTA. When my younger brother was born, I spent the week at my grandparents. I don't see how this is any different. It's a week, not forever.", "NTA. Newborns are a lot of work. Your body is going through a lot, not just with healing but hormones, sleep deprivation, etc. I don't see that it's anything mean or malicious that you want a week.", "NAH you each have decent points, but I think rather than asking him not get his daughter you could have tried suggesting the mother keep her an extra week and then once you get settled in see if you could keep her an extended time.  I think you kind of TA for the way you asked (based on your explanation) rather than for your intentions.", "NTA", "OP, I suspect many of the folks posting here are young with no children. It is customary to have family members care for other babies or toddlers for awhile when a new baby arrives. You are definately NTA. I hope your husband will let his daughter's Mom or other family keep her for you for that week. If not, he needs to be clear that tending to his daughter will be his job during the first week, and possibly longer. I hope you have a playpen for the older baby; you will need it for awhile! Edit to add NTA.", "Honestly\u2026 NAH. I get that he wants to be there for his first kid and he probably doesn\u2019t want to make her feel like he\u2019s pushing her to the side for the new baby. But you\u2019re also going to be recovering from birthing a whole child. You won\u2019t have the full attention you would need for the entirety of the time you should, so asking for a week is not a big ask in my opinion.", "Info: what do you think couples who have a child/children do after having another baby?", "NTA. You have a right to rest, recover and enjoy you little one without having to look after another baby.", "NTA. Things in co-parenting come up all the time. You need to talk to the co-parent and possibly the grandparents about taking the other child for  a week as you recover.\n\nIn reality if you had had the child I highly doubt you would be pregnant this quick so you would have already had more likely had a kid closer to 3 years old which would a little bit easier to deal with ...", "First of all birth control. Safe sex and responsibility would be nice. That being said, expecting you to take care of another child when you are recovering from childbirth is ridiculous. So NTA but these poor kids.", "NTA", "YTA.", "Gentle YTA. You can't stop parenting the older children when their sibling is born. Also the older baby's mother has made her schedules around the fact that the father rears the baby on agreed upon days, so you should ask her if the changes are okay - you can't just decide to not pick up the baby.", "NTA - this is one of those circumstances where step parents are judged more harshly than bio parents. If she was your bio child people wouldn\u2019t blink at you enlisting grandparents to watch her while you were in the hospital and immediately after getting home.", "YTA. You should accept his child if you are going to marry him.", "Your edit doesn\u2019t help your cause. People bring babies home to older kids all the time.

Are you going to ship off this baby when another baby\u2019s birth comes along? Highly doubtful. You\u2019ve made it clear that she isn\u2019t accepted.

One week is completely fine and acceptable.", "So I think you\u2019re NTA for your concerns. Giving birth could be easy as pie (my mother had deliveries so easy the doctor joked she should do it professionally) or it could be a flaming road through hell (my best friend had almost 40 stitches to put her lady parts back together and my cousin ended up unable to walk with a split pelvis for 2 months after her 3rd delivery) . \n\nI also agree with the perspective of everyone saying that you can\u2019t just place your existing child (you\u2019re a bonus mom) on pause. \n\nIf you knew her mom and had a good relationship, it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to ask her if she could possibly be prepared to make adjustments to the schedule to help support your recovery. It also wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to ask your fianc\u00e9 if he would be willing to have a friend or family member stay over to help if necessary. \n\nI think asking that the little one not be around at all for a week or more is the more extreme ask, and might be better left as a last resort solution.", "NTA for asking. has he asked the mother if it\u2019s okay to pause for a week? Perhaps he can make up his missed days later? It\u2019s up to him and his ex. Not you.

You don\u2019t get to make demands now, your husband gets equal say.", "I would like to know who does the parenting for his daughter while she's there. Does he take care of her himself like diaper changes, feedings etc.? Or this all you", "ESH. He should still have her over for a little bit, maybe not sleepover (if that\u2019s what usually happens) but to at least see her baby brother. \n\nBut ultimately it\u2019s your & his call. After giving birth folks react different and I don\u2019t fault anyone.", "YTA\n\nSoft YTA. \n\nI appreciate that this is your first child but it's not his. You're asking your partner to stop being a parent to his other kif for a week or so. That's not how parenting works nor is it fair to ask him to do that. He can provide more support and take on more of the load for you and the new kid. He can't stop being a dad because it's not a great time for him to already be a dad when you want his sole attention for a week or more.\n\n You've got to learn to manage as you and your child are going to need support for not just a week, it will be weeks. If you start going down this path now it's easy for you to ask/demand he doesn't see his child whenever things are tough for you.\n\nEdit: However, needing more support means you can ask for other things that would make you NTA. Such as working with the daughters mum or his family so you can get extra support or asking the ex if she would mind swapping some days round etc. It shouldn't be about a kid being inconvenient but more about that more support is needed.", "YTA. You don\u2019t stop being a parent to your other children because you have a new baby. You had a child with a man who already has a child. He needs to live up to his responsibilities. He\u2019s probably seeing this as the new baby isn\u2019t even here yet and your pushing his daughter aside.", "NTA I don\u2019t think your fianc\u00e9 fully understands what it\u2019s going to be like for the first few weeks especially if you end up having a C-section.  Even after birth when you are in the hospital you get very little sleep since you\u2019re trying to feed the baby.  I do think that\u2019s a good idea that your future stepdaughter stays with her mom for at least the first week more if you have a C-section.  If you have a C-section, then your fianc\u00e9 is really gonna have to pick up a lot of the slack around everything since you won\u2019t be able to lift anything and should be on bedrest.  The adjustment of having a newborn is very jarring especially if it\u2019s your first.  Also, if you haven\u2019t done it already, I highly recommend you look up YouTube videos about what to do for yourself after you have a baby.  I\u2019m so happy I did that for my first because I was well prepared. Get any supplies you need now and prep whatever you can.

Also, that you demanded she not come that week.

And that's all without complications like an emergency c-section, or medical conditions that become apparent in mum or baby immediately post-birth.\n\nWhen you're giving birth a second time round, you're still dealing with the hormones and healing, but the new baby isn't as huge of a paradigm shift as the first one - you know what to expect, you're not learning to breastfeed or manage nappies, and you know what to expect with how you (personally and the family unit) manage/function with the sleep deprivation. You know what did and didn't work last time, compared to the first child when you're figuring EVERYTHING out for the first time.\n\n>Honestly, it\u2019s even more screwed up that she would think she gets to make the unilateral decision to ban someone else from seeing their own small child. He isn\u2019t allowed to see his kid at all?\n\nSounds like she hasn't *demanded*, she has *asked*. And what she *has* asked is that his daughter doesn't come to visit for all of 3 days.

I wouldn\u2019t have felt comfortable altering their routine like that before they were old enough to express discomfort though; even work travel (which is me leaving them with their other parent, in their home, with zero disruptions to their routine) is incredibly tough on the toddler, while the elementary aged kid handles it fine.

That's awesome. It's also not realistic for most people. Yes, try to keep routines as steady as possible, but things happen. People travel. People get sick. Emergencies happen.
