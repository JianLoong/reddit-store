We waited for a paternity test and sure enough 2 months after that it was confirmed that he had a daughter. I never resented this and actually really like her. I've never met the mom and don't plan on it for awhile so there is zero drama there. I help watch her and raise her when we have her every Wednesday night and every other weekend. \n\nMy issue is that 6 months into our relationship I found out I was pregnant. Currently I have about 6 weeks to go until I pop. I told him the other day that the week I go into labor and return home with him and our son, I don't want his daughter here for at least a week. I also said if I give birth in let's say a Thursday, I really don't want him to leave that weekend and go pick up his daughter. I feel like all of his attention would elsewhere and he'd have to be gone with her while I'm at the hospital. A few of my reasons are is she's extremely fussy and can only be calmed down when being held by him 24/7. She's also a huge screamer. I just don't see how we're going to be able to get our newborn settled and him ( my fiance ) be able to take care of our son if she needs constant care during her time here. Again, I love her and have known her the same amount of time he's known her. I just don't know how it would work while I'm healing in stitches and our son and his daughter are crying all at once. I won't mind the juggle once I'm more healed. He doesn't really seem to understand this though and said he only sees half of my reasoning as valid. AITA? I just feel as though a not even 1 1/2 year old and a newborn would be too much all at once for at least the beginning stretch. Not sure how selfish I'm being and maybe it's just my anxiety. I'm 21 and this is my first child myself so I don't have anything to go off of and just want all the uninterrupted support I can have for at least the first week. \n\nEdit: to just explain myself a bit further I'm getting a lot of people saying I'm not accepting her and that couldn't be further from the truth. I myself was born of a one night stand and we almost broke up purely because I wanted him to focus solely on her. I love her and when we get married that is my daughter as well. I have been here the entire time helping raise her and I think it's a bit presumptuous for people to think I'm asking him to pay attention to only my son and I.

NTA.\n\nYou're not telling your fianc\u00e9 to get rid of his other child. You're asking for one week while you recover from childbirth and adjust to having the new baby. He has her on Wednesdays and every other weekend, so you're really only asking for ~3 days, depending on timing. I don't think that's unreasonable. How is it any different from if he had to travel for work or something and her mother needed to keep her for that whole week?", "NTA\n\nI have such a big family, when my cousin gave birth to her 3rd child, her mum drove down an hour from where she lived to pick up the older two kids and take them back to her house for a few days, just so my cousin and her partner could rest a little and get settled in. \n\nShe isn't asking to not parent  his fiance's child ever again for crying out loud, her fiance's child has been a part of their family from the beginning and she has been great with it, and will continue to be a part of the family, she is just asking for a little time with her newborn and him for a few days, possibly a week. \n\nIf you have the family to do it, it's not completely out of the ordinary to have someone from the family look after your other kids while you settle in with a newborn for a little bit.\n\nShe's young and it's her first child, can we give her break?", "NTA. Having a newborn is stressful enough already. You already will be exhausted with the newborn alone. Grandparents or other family members should take his kids so you can focus on you and your newborns health and wellbeing", "NTA. It's not like OP is asking to stop caring for fiance kid altogether. She just wants 1 week to settle down with the new baby, which doesnt seem that unreasonable to me. \n\nWhile you cant choose to just stop caring for 1 child over the other, you're also a new parent. As long as the little toddler will be cared for by her mom or other relative, then shouldn't just one week away be fine?", "NTA. You might be if you had asked like six months but a week or even a month while you\u2019re healing and getting used to a new baby is understandable. Even with biological children some parents choose to have their older child stay with grandparents at the beginning so the mom can heal and everyone has an easier time adjusting", "Info: what will you do when you get pregnant again?  Kick out both other kids for a week?", "NAH. The end of pregnancy is a pretty scary and anxious time, and your brain goes into overdrive trying to think of how to make things as easy as possible. But I will say, for me and lots of my mom friends the adjustment period was more like a month or so after birth, not right after (minus c-section recovery which was tough). But you\u2019re kind of on a \u201cpost-birth high\u201d for a little while and trying to find your new normal is fun and exciting. But after a few weeks that wears off, and the fatigue and other issues crop up and make things a little tougher. All that to say, I wouldn\u2019t keep his daughter away as it will be best to integrate and deal with life the way it\u2019ll realistically be right from the start. Things will likely go smoother than you\u2019re anticipating. But you\u2019re NTA for having this feeling and discussing it with your partner, or even if that\u2019s what you decide to do. \n\nBest of luck and congratulations!", "This is very tricky. On one hand, this is his daughter, he needs to be there for her. On the other hand you need a little extra attention. \nMaybe, talk to the other baby\u2019s mother, and ask if she wouldn\u2019t mind cutting the visit a little short. \nPlease don\u2019t demand this of either of them. You don\u2019t need to cause unnecessary drama. NTA for wanting the small break.", "I don't think the request is unreasonable honestly, having two young children is really difficult even if you aren't healing from giving birth. You need his support right now, his daughter isn't gonna remember this when she's older. NTA", "YTA\n\nYou don't just hit pause on existing kids and parenting when you have a new one. \"Can we parent the existing kids and a new one too?\" is the kind of question you ask and answer before deciding to have another baby.", "NTA\n\nHis daughter has another caregiver, the mother. She will be in perfectly good hands. It's not like it's both of your children. Asking for less distractions is reasonable. Also lots of parents who are having their second child together, will send their first child together to the grands or something.  I might suggest a compromise if he still wants to hang out with his daughter. Have you talked to him about it?", "YTA\n\nI hate to say it but it sounds like you just want your fiance to focus on YOU and YOUR son and not HIS daughter. Like you want him focused on his \"new\" family. You need to change that attitude and start treating that little girl like she's a part of your family too. Especially since once you get married, that little girl is your step-daughter.\n\nJuggling another child with a newborn has been done by many, many people so its not a new concept. Some even have to juggle two or more newborn babies at once! I know as a new mom it can be stressful, but you kinda did the baby thing with his daughter already no? Maybe not to the same extent but at least you have some experience.\n\nIf you want / need support after your pregnancy, is it possible for your mom / sister / aunt or someone to help you out for a week or two? Its really not fair of you to ask your fiance to stay away from his daughter for a week or more.", "NTA\n\nNot remotely selfish. Barring some emergency with his daughter's mom, there is no reason for him to have her for a long stretch your first few days until you settle in.", "YTA.\n\nDo you think most people send their older kids away for a week when they give birth?", "YTA he comes with the kid no matter if convenient or not.", "NTA.  Just to ask, can you get some support from other family members while you recuperate (i.e., your mom, a sister)?", "Y\u2019all are ridiculous! Let this lady have one week to heal and be with her child. She already gave reasons- which are completely understandable. And 2days isn\u2019t going to kill the daughter. She\u2019s so young she wouldn\u2019t even understand. Stop being so dramatic and let OP have some peace with her nb baby for a few days. She doesn\u2019t even live with them full time or 50/50. It\u2019s 3 days IF delivery falls on their weekend to have her. 1 day if it doesn\u2019t. Its not that serious! YOU ARE NOT THE AH mama. These commenters are tho. Smh", "YTA you can't just do away with the kid when it's not convenient for you, that's not how families work", "NTA. When my younger brother was born, I spent the week at my grandparents. I don't see how this is any different. It's a week, not forever.", "NTA. Newborns are a lot of work. Your body is going through a lot, not just with healing but hormones, sleep deprivation, etc. I don't see that it's anything mean or malicious that you want a week.", "NAH you each have decent points, but I think rather than asking him not get his daughter you could have tried suggesting the mother keep her an extra week and then once you get settled in see if you could keep her an extended time.  I think you kind of TA for the way you asked (based on your explanation) rather than for your intentions.", "NTA", "OP, I suspect many of the folks posting here are young with no children. It is customary to have family members care for other babies or toddlers for awhile when a new baby arrives. You are definately NTA. I hope your husband will let his daughter's Mom or other family keep her for you for that week. If not, he needs to be clear that tending to his daughter will be his job during the first week, and possibly longer. I hope you have a playpen for the older baby; you will need it for awhile! Edit to add NTA.", "Honestly\u2026 NAH. I get that he wants to be there for his first kid and he probably doesn\u2019t want to make her feel like he\u2019s pushing her to the side for the new baby. But you\u2019re also going to be recovering from birthing a whole child. You won\u2019t have the full attention you would need for the entirety of the time you should, so asking for a week is not a big ask in my opinion.", "Info: what do you think couples who have a child/children do after having another baby?", "NTA. You have a right to rest, recover and enjoy you little one without having to look after another baby.", "NTA. Things in co-parenting come up all the time. You need to talk to the co-parent and possibly the grandparents about taking the other child for  a week as you recover.\n\nIn reality if you had had the child I highly doubt you would be pregnant this quick so you would have already had more likely had a kid closer to 3 years old which would a little bit easier to deal with ...", "First of all birth control. Safe sex and responsibility would be nice. That being said, expecting you to take care of another child when you are recovering from childbirth is ridiculous. So NTA but these poor kids.", "NTA", "YTA.", "Gentle YTA. You can't stop parenting the older children when their sibling is born. Also the older baby's mother has made her schedules around the fact that the father rears the baby on agreed upon days, so you should ask her if the changes are okay - you can't just decide to not pick up the baby.", "NTA - this is one of those circumstances where step parents are judged more harshly than bio parents. If she was your bio child people wouldn\u2019t blink at you enlisting grandparents to watch her while you were in the hospital and immediately after getting home.", "YTA. You should accept his child if you are going to marry him.", "Your edit doesn\u2019t help your cause. People bring babies home to older kids all the time. And you don\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to be able to take care of \u201cour son if she needs constant care during his time here?\u201d\n\nWell, your baby\u2019s father is also that little girl\u2019s, and that little girl is your baby\u2019s big sister. Are you going to ship off this baby when another baby\u2019s birth comes along? Highly doubtful. You\u2019ve made it clear that she isn\u2019t accepted. It\u2019s both of his kids - he is a DAD to TWO kids, not one. \n\nYTA.", "You\u2019re gonna be juggling may as well start sooner rather than later. They\u2019re siblings. My step kids came over for afternoons for the first couple weeks; they stayed at their moms. Once things settled a bit they started staying over. Maybe you can try that so he can still have time with his daughter and she can meet her brother but it\u2019s in shorter segments", "YTA this is your life you can\u2019t just have her when it\u2019s convenient for you. I had my kids 16 months apart and had a c-section and took care of my kids. Your husband has a responsibility.", "NTA...you do you.  1 wk isn't asking much", "NTA a week is resonable, and healing after birth is hard. You are not asking for anything crazy. One week is completely fine and acceptable.", "So I think you\u2019re NTA for your concerns. Giving birth could be easy as pie (my mother had deliveries so easy the doctor joked she should do it professionally) or it could be a flaming road through hell (my best friend had almost 40 stitches to put her lady parts back together and my cousin ended up unable to walk with a split pelvis for 2 months after her 3rd delivery) . \n\nI also agree with the perspective of everyone saying that you can\u2019t just place your existing child (you\u2019re a bonus mom) on pause. \n\nIf you knew her mom and had a good relationship, it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to ask her if she could possibly be prepared to make adjustments to the schedule to help support your recovery. It also wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to ask your fianc\u00e9 if he would be willing to have a friend or family member stay over to help if necessary. \n\nI think asking that the little one not be around at all for a week or more is the more extreme ask, and might be better left as a last resort solution.", "NTA for asking. has he asked the mother if it\u2019s okay to pause for a week? Perhaps he can make up his missed days later? It\u2019s up to him and his ex. Not you. I think people don\u2019t have sympathy because you went into this (getting pregnant) knowing he had a young child. You don\u2019t get to make demands now, your husband gets equal say.", "I would like to know who does the parenting for his daughter while she's there. Does he take care of her himself like diaper changes, feedings etc.? Or this all you", "ESH. He should still have her over for a little bit, maybe not sleepover (if that\u2019s what usually happens) but to at least see her baby brother. \n\nBut ultimately it\u2019s your & his call. After giving birth folks react different and I don\u2019t fault anyone.", "YTA\n\nSoft YTA. \n\nI appreciate that this is your first child but it's not his. You're asking your partner to stop being a parent to his other kif for a week or so. That's not how parenting works nor is it fair to ask him to do that. He can provide more support and take on more of the load for you and the new kid. He can't stop being a dad because it's not a great time for him to already be a dad when you want his sole attention for a week or more.\n\n You've got to learn to manage as you and your child are going to need support for not just a week, it will be weeks. If you start going down this path now it's easy for you to ask/demand he doesn't see his child whenever things are tough for you.\n\nEdit: However, needing more support means you can ask for other things that would make you NTA. Such as working with the daughters mum or his family so you can get extra support or asking the ex if she would mind swapping some days round etc. It shouldn't be about a kid being inconvenient but more about that more support is needed.", "YTA. You don\u2019t stop being a parent to your other children because you have a new baby. You had a child with a man who already has a child. He needs to live up to his responsibilities. He\u2019s probably seeing this as the new baby isn\u2019t even here yet and your pushing his daughter aside.", "NTA I don\u2019t think your fianc\u00e9 fully understands what it\u2019s going to be like for the first few weeks especially if you end up having a C-section.  Even after birth when you are in the hospital you get very little sleep since you\u2019re trying to feed the baby.  I do think that\u2019s a good idea that your future stepdaughter stays with her mom for at least the first week more if you have a C-section.  If you have a C-section, then your fianc\u00e9 is really gonna have to pick up a lot of the slack around everything since you won\u2019t be able to lift anything and should be on bedrest.  The adjustment of having a newborn is very jarring especially if it\u2019s your first.  Also, if you haven\u2019t done it already, I highly recommend you look up YouTube videos about what to do for yourself after you have a baby.  I\u2019m so happy I did that for my first because I was well prepared. Get any supplies you need now and prep whatever you can.  Try to make everything as easy as possible. \n\nI found this video extremely helpful and I hope it\u2019s helpful for you too .\n\n[https://youtu.be/ANdg3GX1d4w](https://youtu.be/ANdg3GX1d4w)", "[deleted]", "NAH but your boyfriend needs to figure out how he's going to parent two kids. People with children have babies and they don't usually have the option of not having one of them around most of the week. What's he going to do when she's visiting and both of them are screaming? I think it's fair of you to ask him to make a plan for the week you give birth though.", "Yta", "YTA", "NTA. The daughter has behavioral issues that will disrupt your son. You 100% need time to heal and get settled. Your husband is being ridiculous.", "NTA.

Not everyone has a village so close knit that they can just send their kids away for a week.", "That\u2019s because she\u2019s going to need his help right then for both herself and her baby.", "I mean\u2026 a lot of them do, yes.", "I mean, yes? Or a family member comes and stays to help with the older child.", "I get that. I just feel as it's a bit unfair when he's about to leave on a big 10 day trip halfway across the country and it's ok to not see her then but when I'm in the hospital in labor it's not ok to ask for a single week to get used to things?", "He didn't exactly come with the kid though. They found out about the kid when they were already seeing each other. \n\nI mean, I don't want kids and when I was single I was adamant about not dating someone with kids but it's a bit different if you're already attached when they find out about it. \n\nOP decided to stay with him and have a kid with him, and is asking for a short bit of time alone with him and their newborn. It's missing one visit around the birth, not asking him to abandon the kid FFS.", "My parents sent us to stay with grandparents and so did all my friends parents. \n\nI get that it was a different time but it's not unreasonable to ask for a few days, if it's possible and someone else can care for the older kids while you get settled.", "Irish twins are a very common thing.. \n\nPlenty of people have kids only 13 to 15 months apart.", "Yea they sound like idiots. He has a surprise kid with a fling and then knocks up his current girl a few months later?", "I like in Oklahoma and was on birth control. Was just in a moment of switching them around due to ovarian cysts that would never go away. Also have endometriosis so didn't think I'd be fertile like this. I see your point though. All in hindsight", "Who appointed you morality judge? Let these people live. You know nothing about them.", "I really don't understand where in my post I have made it seem like she isn't accepted. I'm worried about her care just as much as our son during that week. She hates not seeing him within sight her entire time being awake and I'm honestly worried she's going to be miserable during the time I'm unable to get up and help. He's a father to two kids but he isn't invincible. There's going to be slip ups in the beginning for sure. I just want to minimize that for at least a week when I can barely walk and it'd really be up to him to take care of both for the main part. They are only a year apart and both are babies. I don't see them both receiving the care they need at the same time. When it is just her sometimes we have a tough time. She's just that attached to him which we both love but when it comes to splitting that time she's going to be extremely unhappy not getting the attention she needs and I'm worried that will in turn cycle onto our newborn getting upset and not getting the rest he needs. And again we don't get her for an entire week. Depending on the week I'd be asking we just don't have her that Wednesday night and she stay with her mother and extra day. I'm really happy that my baby has a big sister because I honestly don't know if I'll be able to give birth again after this. But as I also said, I'm new to this. I just don't know how we're going to juggle it. We started visitations with her when she was 2 months old so I don't truly know how a newborn is going to act", "Am I the only one who has a extended family who helps the mother with her other kids when she has a newborn, I thought it was quite common for parents to take the siblings for a few days while child gets settled with their newborn? My cousin has a newborn baby and her mother came and got the two older kids and took them back to her house for a few days.\n\nIt's not a weird concept in our family. I thought a lot more people would have families who do this for them?", "We split things 50/50. Sometimes he works weekends and I do the main amount of caretaking. Other times he and I will both take care of her together", "Apparently he gets to choose for vacation though. Which he is going on while his partner is heavily pregnant.", "Ikr? All the people who never gave birth or even watched someone give birth and try to recover sounding off in the comments. Here is a very short and incomplete list of things that often happen when someone gives birth: Tearing&stitches, c-section, issues with post partum hemorrhage, issues with medication&pain management, issues breastfeeding  and the pain associated with that. it's major trauma to your body.", "I mean, yes? Lots of people arrange for help or for an older child to go visit Grandma so they can settle in after giving birth.", "Yes you should be able to tap into your village for that support with your older kids while recovering from the trauma of birth.", "But you are missing the point that unlike you she didn\u2019t give birth to the other child and has not been through childbirth.  \n\nShe has no idea how she will feel afterwards both mentally and physically and its not unreasonable to request a week of just the 3 of them to get accustomed to being FULLTIME parents to a newborn.\n\nYou may not have been offered or wanted but it is not uncommon for grandparent to help out with looking after other children (either in their own home or move in temporarily) when a newborn arrives so it no is not an unreasonable request.\n\nOP is NTA", "What are you talking about? They're not \"getting rid of the other kid\" for a week. The other kid lives with her mom and stays with her dad and OP one day a week and every other weekend. The other kid would just be going one week without visiting her dad -- and even then, OP didn't say her fianc\u00e9 couldn't go visit his daughter that week, just that she didn't want the daughter to stay with them during that week.\n\nI feel like a lot of people are missing the fact that the other kid is not OP's child.", "Yes. When it comes to having multiple children you do have to weigh what\u2019s the best option. The daughter has behavior issues and the pregnant mother needs time to heal and adapt. It\u2019s not abandoning the daughter.", "Okey you are .....They have the luxury to make it work and they should.You really think this is deep ,its not just a fair deal.", "So why is it unreasonable? Just because you don't have the same option?", "You sound salty. Lots of people send their older kids to grandma for a few days to settle in. It\u2019s ok to have help.", "No one in this situation is an asshole. Her fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t want to keep his child away which is also understandable. They just need to talk it out and agree on the best conclusion for all involved.", "If someone wants time away from their older children and someone is willing to help, that's awesome...and very different than someone deciding for you that your child isn't welcome in your own home.", "You stayed with your grandparents over the stated objections of your parents? Because that's the conflict here.", "Having someone offer to watch older siblings, when you have the opportunity to decline, is very different than your partner deciding that you should forego your visitation with your child.", "Yes, if he was the one who decided that he didn't want to take his visitation and asked for help, that would be different. The conflict here is that he doesn't want to skip time with his daughter.", "Yes, I understand the concept of accidental conception. Even in the situation of birth control failure (or not using it), there's still decisions to be made about whether one will carry to term or whether one will decide to stay in a short-term relationship that has resulted in pregnancy (which will include accomodations for any existing children your partner has). OP has chosen to have a child with someone who has one already and to live with that person. That he has existing parental obligations isn't breaking news to her at this point.", "I know. And I was probably a bit harsher than I meant to be, but I just don't think its fair to ask the fiance to keep his daughter away. It doesn't sound like he has her all that much to begin with, so maybe she wouldn't even be at the house that much anyways? A lot of families deal with having multiple children. Its not an impossible task was my point.", "She knew he had a kid. That doesn't just go away when she wants him solely focused on her. \n\nHer argument has validity but is presented poorly and selfishly.", "We got sent to our grandparents for days each time a new sibling came along and only got to come visit for a few mins. I thought it was great cause my grandparents were fun, let me eat lots of biscuits and stay up late, and I knew I'd have to start helping out with the baby when I got back.", "Really?  Most of my friends have kids, and none of us did that...", "Maybe there is a compromise OP and the father can reach then, with family members coming to help during the day, for example, send letting the older child stay at night (or vice versa)", "It\u2019s absolutely ok. NTA. But also try not to get into that measuring stuff about when he takes time without her (like for his trip)/coparenting with his ex, etc. As someone who coparents with my kids father and my partner also has a child, I can say that I was a million times happier once I realized it was almost never fair in the short term but that it really does all even out. And it is such an emotional topic to argue about, it often goes sideways. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, might I suggest talking to him again and saying it is simply a matter of giving your body time to heal and not only will you need extra help because of that, you won\u2019t be able to help with your daughter. Just straight up medical concerns might push fewer buttons (it\u2019s really emotional for everyone right now)", "I understand how you feel but he\u2019s allowed a vacation. He doesn\u2019t have to make up for the fact he has had one by ditching his daughter to make things feel fair to you.\n\nWhen you got involved with a man with a child you knew that this would mean that he isn\u2019t going to ever be able to put her aside for your convenience, nor should he. Unfortunately you\u2019re just going to have to deal with having two kids in the house. That\u2019s the deal you bought into.\n\nEdit: I appreciate you only found out two months in but still, you had a choice to leave the relationship rather than starting a family.", "Your boyfriend needs to start taking some more responsibility about where and how he ejaculates.", "Understood but your doctor should have told you to use other methods when switching BC. I wish you well.", "Don\u2019t let anyone shame you for regular things that happen.", "Your baby might be your \"miracle baby\" then. Congratulations!", "I only know what she said. A kid he didn't know about and a few months later another  woman pregnant. I also wished them well but it will likely be difficult given that he is already expecting her to have his other kid in their home when she is recovering from birth. So clueless about how difficult that will be. It is reality not morality.", "For me, it's your wording. 'Our son' vs 'his daughter'. You say you are involved, but it's always 'his daughter'. Also, that you demanded she not come that week. The mature thing might have been to speak to both and *ask* if mom would be ok watching the daughter for a couple extra days while you settle in after the birth. Share your concerns, but not if they include 'your kid is loud and might upset *my* kid'.", "I\u2019m not here to judge you, OP. I read between all those lines.  There was a lot of backstory to how this little girl came into your life in order to justify a one week visit gap. If you said, \n\n\u201cMy partner has a little girl that is fussy and I\u2019m worried about getting her brother settled his first week home, WIBTA if I asked for extra help or if big sister can stay with her mom for the first few days we\u2019re home?\u201d That is different. \n\nAsking for \u201cchild-free\u201d time when bringing home a baby isn\u2019t an asshole move, but all the detail you put into the story puts it there in my book. \n\nI hope you can figure out a way that your fianc\u00e9 can try to be a dad to both. His fussy baby may just become an amazing big sister when she has a task to do. She\u2019s 1, but babies are smart. Perhaps bring in a support net of his family or yours during that time. Let him try to have his dad time, and support you. This is a decades long journey y\u2019all have just begun. Good luck.", "I get what you\u2019re saying but her not being there for a week isn\u2019t going to change anything lol. Y\u2019all still have to learn how to juggle two kids and all that comes with adding a new baby to the mix. I\u2019m sorry to say but hitting pause isn\u2019t going to change how stressful of a time y\u2019all are about to have unfortunately.", "Your family sounds awesome, but no, there are many who don\u2019t. I\u2019m the oldest of 4 and all of us were home. My in laws will keep the kids during the hospital stay, but not the first week. For many families, it is a bonding time. OP\u2019s partner could want this time to bond with his babies. But, there are definitely options OP should try to find something to make both of them happy.", "She can have grandma come help her. The kid doesn\u2019t even live there 24/7, so she can\u2019t even share the attention for a day or two. That is pathetic. Her mommy can come give her 24/7 attention. Dad has another child to care for.", "It doesn\u2019t matter that she didn\u2019t give birth to the other child. Honestly, it\u2019s even more screwed up that she would think she gets to make the unilateral decision to ban someone else from seeing their own small child. He isn\u2019t allowed to see his kid at all? She is definitely an asshole for that. If she\u2019s so helpless she can\u2019t move on her own for a week, she should have a grandparent come to help her.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if OP is the other child\u2019s parent. If anything, that might make it worse. And no, she had a problem with him even going there. She has no right to take the kid\u2019s already small amount of time with her father away from either of them.", "It is. It\u2019s banning the father from seeing his older child because she thinks she should be the center of attention. If she can\u2019t deal, she should have her mommy come help her, not kick out a toddler. Also, wanting to be held is normal toddler behavior.", "Oh I have the option, plenty of people willing to take my kids. \n\nI won\u2019t do it though, because my *choice* to have this child doesn\u2019t mean I get to ignore my duties as a parent. And regardless of what anyone thinks, accidental or not, OP and her partner *chose* to have this child. It is not fair and not in the child\u2019s best interest to be ignored for OP\u2019s convenience.", "And that means he sucks. \n\nHe will skip his time.with his daughter to go on vacation (while his partner is heavily pregnant) but not to help his partner with a newborn..", "Okay but the other child still has a mother? She is asking for 3 days... thats COMPLETELY normal.", "I stayed with my grandma for about a week when my brother was born.  My best friend just had her 2nd kid and the older one stayed with me for 5 days. It's not uncommon", "It\u2019s really normal in my family. We all pitch in. The older kids get to be there for the baby\u2019s arrival, but then they get taken out for a special treat (a meal or ice cream or the park) with aunts, uncles or grandparents. Then they sleepover with their cousins or go to my parents house (they have a farm so the kids love it there) while the new baby gets settled in. \n\nThese days of course a lot of people don\u2019t have family close by to do this sort of thing, but if they\u2019re around why not get some help? It\u2019s awesome.", "He\u2019s allowed a vacation but she isn\u2019t allowed a week where he fully helps with their baby?", "I really only use that terminology because we aren't getting married until our baby is born. Technically she is his daughter. I just didn't feel like I have the right to claim her like that without that legal bonding saying that she is my daughter as well. I treat her and consider her my daughter but I just didn't think I could claim her as that yet. It's more just not really knowing how to word things to make it easy for Reddit to read. And nothing has been set in stone yet. That's why I posted this in advance. I asked him, not demanded. It's still a talk in works and I'm thinking about asking for outside help as well if he ends up disagreeing fully in the end.", "I get from reading these comments I could've worded things a lot differently. Because in reality that's all I am asking for. Just for her to stay with her mom a few extra days while we settle in and then we take on both kids as a team. I just didn't think it was fair to ask the grandparents to watch her when she has a better support system at her mom's house. The mom doesn't work so it wouldn't be getting in the way of making money or anything.  But also realize it could be deemed unfair on her end. I may ask her grandmother ( fiance's mom ) to watch her during that first week when we have her.", "It definitely won't change anything you're right. I only really ask for that week because I want to heal a bit more and then I can help out more when she needs her dad and our son needs a parent too. It's less about learning how to juggle and more about not being able to juggle as well when it's just him. I'm more than happy to take on both when I can move. I also just don't know how bad the pain from stitches is going to be because again, first baby", "But it will give OP time to physically recover. What if she has a rough labor? What if she has a c-section? Then she will need her partner on hand. \n\nAlso the fact that he can vacation and be away from his daughter (while his partner is heavily pregnant) but she can't ask for a break to give birth definitely makes me side-eye him.", "But if she can get her fiance's ex to just keep his daughter for the weekend they normally have her? What is really the issue there? I sort of don't get it? She isn't really asking for a lot, is the issue because so many people don't have that option when they had a baby so there are jealous?\n\nThere is plenty of time for the siblings to bond, not being there for the weekend she is normally isn't really going to break there bonding time is it? Come on!\n\nI feel everyone is being incredibly harsh on here to her. Like she has shunned her fiance daughter forever out of their lives, guys she asking for the weekend she is usually there to just have this break with her newborn, one weekend? I'm stunned that's considered she is being awful.", "She wants help after giving birth. She wants a few days to settle in with one child before having two (including a very clingy toddler). \n\nIf Dad can leave his child to go on vacation (while OP is heavily pregnant) then I don't think OP is unreasonable asking for the same consideration when she gives birth. \n\nShe is 21, this is her first child and she has no idea what her labor and delivery will be like.", "It\u2019s for less than a week. She\u2019s not asking for a month she\u2019s asking for 3 days. It\u2019s not uncommon for coparents to pick up the slack when the other parent is unavailable for whatever reason.

She's saying \"hey, how she stays at home, where she already lives, with her mother, for the whole week, instead of spending Wednesday here?\" The daughter isn't being ignored.\n\nYou've never let your kid stay with family for a day?", "I simply don't agree he's an asshole for wanting to spend time with both his kids.", "It's normal when the parents ask for help. The conflict here is that her father doesn't want to skip visitation with her, which is also normal.", "Thanks for the info.  Must just not be common here!\n\nThe other issue is...who will watch his other kiddo?  They can't just assume the Mom will as it isn't \"her time\".

Part of deciding to have kids with a parent is knowing that they won't be 100% allocated to your child. That she's a first time parent doesn't mean he should pretend to be.", "Ah. If it was a conscious choice then your reasoning makes sense. I was just pointing out what was rubbing me wrong. Even if you aren't married, alot of reddit will use Future such-and-such, like FMIL. I say if you are one of her main caregivers, you can call her your step-daughter even if you are not yet married. You intend her to be and treat her as such, then it's a better wording for your relationship than 'his daughter'. 'His daughter' feels very cold and distant. IMO.\n\n\nDo try to include the mom in on the talks if she is relatively friendly with your bf still. She'll hopefully sympathize with you not being sure how much you can handle right away and that you are concerned about her daughter as well.", "A bit of unsolicited advice as well. Make back up plans for your back up plans. Things happen on baby's time, no one else's. Have people lined up that can take your step-daughter in for a bit if you go into labor while you have her. Her mom, grandparents, friends. Know who you can call to come take care of her.", "That makes a lot of sense. I am sorry if it was harsh. I really like your idea of asking your fianc\u00e9\u2019s mom, because then there is all the excitement that the baby can feel too, and grandma, and dad. I wish you a swift and safe birth, OP. Enjoy your summer baby!", "Lol who said I didn\u2019t agree with her like I said I see her point I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s not gonna change much for the stress they are about to be put under. Nowhere did I say she was in the wrong nor did I say she was an asshole for wanting this.", "Not jealous. I thoroughly enjoyed my 20s baby free. I specifically stated OP\u2019s partner could want this time to bond with his babies, not the babies bonding. And, I do think that the grandma would be a better option because if he wants to drop in with new baby or have his mom bring the baby over, etc., it\u2019ll be much easier. He\u2019s excited, and I don\u2019t think he could really show that excitement with other baby mama. But, I gotta run\u2026this was a good one!", "She is not asking for forever. She is asking for one week after she gives birth where she might need a lot of assistance (and depending on the week, she could only be asking him to give one day).", "I'd suggest they ask the mom, and if she can't look for other options (other family, friends,  sitter). They could also offer to take her more days in the future to \"even it out\" if that's a concern", "I think very possibly it would be. Grandparents and Aunts step in frequently to take care of the younger kid to give the mom a tiny bit of time.", "Or, the guy can take care of his child.", "Family would help for an afternoon, sure. I've personally never seen family help so much as to take the 2nd kid for weeks.", "Always an option, however OP makes a valid point that she (and baby) will both need extra attention the 1st few days for medical purposes. If there is no other option besides him watching his daughter, OP should consider having trusted friend or family member over to help her", "Ive seen many.", "They don\u2019t need 24/7 attention. I\u2019ve had a baby. I\u2019ve had tons of family members who\u2019ve had babies. Just because she wants something doesn\u2019t mean she needs it. The older child doesn\u2019t need to be sent away just because OP demands to be the center of attention. If she wants to \u201cget used to things\u201d, the other child is part of \u201cthings\u201d. This is life now. Adjust. It isn\u2019t that baby\u2019s fault you decided to add another to the mix.", "That's great you didn't need the extra help the 1st few days! Your experience doesn't diminish OP's tho, or any of us who needed extra help.", "Just because your experience is different doesn't give you the right to invalidate hers. This is completely normal. at least the oldest child is staying at her MOM, not a family member like the majority of older kids i know. Be kind. Rudeness is unnattractive and not a good look on a mother."]}
