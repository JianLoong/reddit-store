His wife Rita (not my birth mom) saw this firsthand but didn\u2019t care as long as Jon played daddy to her biological kids, Cady and Lynn. Lynn was kind to me, and she is the only family member who I have kept in contact with. Cady made my life hell. She continued to be mentally abusive toward me even as she was an adult and I was still a child. Cady never apologized for any of her behavior.\n\nThree years ago, Jon, Rita, and Cady were in an accident. Jon and Rita are both dead, and Cady is disabled. Lynn is Cady\u2019s caretaker. Lynn was a soccer coach and teacher before, but she now stays home and works as an online tutor. Because of the financial situation, a government agency provides a nurse. But they only qualify to have the nurse come for twelve hours total a week. Lynn\u2019s fought tooth and nail for more hours yet she has not been granted an increase.\n\nLynn recently came to me and explained that she\u2019s exhausted from being Cady\u2019s caretaker. She explained that part of the reason she\u2019s had such a difficult time getting an increase in nursing hours from the agency is because the agency has a shortage of health nurses. The agency\u2019s actual recommendation was for a family member to act as a caretaker, and that the family member would be paid through the agency. Lynn begged me to help by acting as a caretaker for Cady because I am the only loved one she has with the ability to do so without giving up my current job. (I have a job in data entry and can work remotely without needing to interact with clients.) She offered to pay me on top of the money from the government agency.\n\nI told Lynn that I would be willing to help run errands for her, so she could spend the time with the nurse present doing something nice for herself like a pedicure or catching up with friends. I also recommended some online groups and classes, where she can socialize with people and pick up hobbies that can be done at home. But I told her that I was not willing to directly care for Cady in any capacity. Cady made my life hell for years. It is honestly the kindest thing for both of us that I am never put in charge of her care. Lynn was very upset but told me that she respected my decision.\n\nI stand by my decision to not act as a caretaker to Cady. But I still feel awful for Lynn because I know I was her only option for a loved one caretaker. Others have told me I am right to feel awful, because I know how much Lynn loved and misses being a teacher and coach. And that even though Cady was mentally abusive to me, she is now severely disabled, and I should help her for Lynn's sake. I know I am probably the AH, but I still wanted to ask on here and possibly gain some more insight.", "created_utc": 1679366410, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11x4h0k/aita_for_refusing_to_take_care_of_my_disabled/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are not her parent- you deserve a life of your own. It sucks for Cady- but this is nobody's fault. Lynn chose to take this responsibility. Did she talk to you before she took it on? She cannot suddenly expect you to contribute to the cause.\n\nYou have offered her options to help her out, and anything more is probably bad for your mental health. Please stand your ground OP.", "NTA. As someone who has been stuck taking care of a family member on her own for five years, I don't blame you. If I had known what hell I'd be going through because of this relative, I never would have done it. Even now I am planning to move in six months or less due to the fact that I just can't handle being near this person anymore. So do yourself a favor and keep away from Cady for your own sake.", "Oof, NTA but a tough one to read. I do not envy your situation. That really sucks. Being a caretaker for someone with a disability isn\u2019t something you can just take on without being fully invested and prepared for so I think you did the right thing. I too feel terrible for Lynn in this situation and it\u2019s absolutely not your fault. \n\nHopefully she takes you up on your offer to help her out in other capacities. I don\u2019t know if you can expand that more to help her do things like laundry or cook?", "NTA. You have to protect your own mental health.", "Brutal, but NTA. You owe Cady nothing, and you can't take on caring for someone you hate even for her sister's sake. It's a huge burden that ruins your own life. Move to another city if you have to.", "NTA. Cady made your life hell.  Help Lynn in other ways, but not Cady directly.", "NTA this is a very hard situation. You offered to run errands and other ways to get help. This is coming from someone who has been on both sides. I took care of my mom who had leukemia until she passed. Now my older brother takes care of me I have AIH a rare condition were I\u2019m in liver failure. I am able to be home alone for short times maybe an afternoon, so my brother can have a few hours to himself. We also have help from the government where a nurse comes in when needed the help and check on me. There are tons of ways to get help. She should have a health insurance card on the back is a number to get assistance. She needs to call that number and tell them what she needs. I\u2019m sorry you all are going through this. It sounds she needs more help but it doesn\u2019t have to be from you.", "Absolutely NTA \nDon\u2019t take this on ever!!!!", "NTA.  Sorry for the situation you are in.  Maybe lynn can find an assisted living facility where cady can live.  She should qualify for funds due to being disabled. Then lyn can step back and begin to regain control of her life.   She is too young to spend the rest of her life caring for her sister", "NAH, but there is a trend on this sub that basically comes down to absolving someone of everything in the name of \"not your circus, not your monkey\" and the counterpoint to this is: Lynne is drowning, she has been kind to you, and she has come specifically to you asking you for help. Everyone is correct that you are under no obligation to give it to her, but if the tables were reversed, wouldn't you appreciate someone throwing you a life preserver, here, and showing you some grace? Lynne's mom is dead. Her sister is severely disabled. No help is on the way. She knows how atrocious her sister was to you, but she asked you anyway. She's truly desperate.\n\nIs there really no compromise to give Lynne some help, if you're her only option? Is Cady still the same person who absused and tormented you, or is she essentially just the shell  who houses the body? Is the person who tormented you gone?   \n\n\nI have been in your exact situation. My abuser's body is alive, but they are not really there anymore. I hate being around him, but I can do it occasionally if I have to, to help other people when they really need it.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is-- you're absolutely right, you have no obligation here, but a little bit of kindness to someone who has shown you kindness in a shitty situation in the past, would go an extremely long way, if you could find a way", "INFO: How disabled/dependent is Cady? Doe she need 24/7 live-in care or can she cope with some things herself?", "NTA. You're not obligated to care for Cady.\n\nIf one has repeatedly tormented a person, then one should not be surprised if that person is disinclined to render aid should one need it at a future date. Cady has made her own bed and must now lie in it. Her problems are not your problems.\n\nShould you feel guilty, then perhaps you could offer your services for suitable compensation, say one hundred dollars per hour plus expenses. It wouldn't be the most competitive rate but it doesn't sound as though you desperately want the work.", "This is a tough one. You care for Lynn and therefore feel you want to help her. But you know your mental health would be destroyed by caring for Cady full time. \n\nIs there a compromise situation where you might watch Cady for one day a month just to give Lynn a full days reprieve ? I understand if that is a hard boundary for you \u2014 you should never be expected to care for someone who abused you. But if you could do something like this even that little bit of relief may do wonders for Lynn\u2019s mental health. \n\nAnother option would be to help Lynn look into putting Cady into an adult home. Depending on where you live this may be an option. As a disabled person myself I hesitate to suggest that but at the same time I know there\u2019s a place I may get to where my wife may not be mentally able to care for me 24/7 and I wouldn\u2019t want her to do that because I love and care for her. \n\nAnyway, NTA, though if you are feeling regret for not being able to help Lynn, there may be creative solutions", "I think NTA here - you've explained why it wouldn't be appropriate or healthy for you to care for Cady although it isn't clear how much care Cady needs (sounds like a lot though). It is terrible that this heavy burden falls on Lynn. I like the suggestions of looking into whether there are any home-based care facilities that Cady might qualify for. It would be great to give Lynn her life back even if she still spends some time with Cady. You don't owe anything in this sad situation so don't feel guilty. Stand your ground.", "NTA - someone who doesn't really want to help (esp because there seems to be some animosity invovled)  should not be shamed into helping. It does more harm than good for everyone involved.", "I\u2019m in a very similar situation, and have struggled to find a balance. I ended up helping my Lynn. E.g. anything I do for my Cady is one less thing on Lynn\u2019s plate. Yes, this means far more face-to-face time with Cady than I would prefer, but I am doing it all for Lynn.\n\nNAH. It\u2019s not an easy choice.", "I'm gonna go with NAH.\n\nThis entire situation is hard. I am so sorry.", "NTA However, don't base your decision on how Cady treated you. That is almost another life now, and the charitable thing to do is forget even if you can't forgive. You've offered what would be a great help to be sure, and it's your decision alone, not about the past, if you want to help Lynn out with direct care of C.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
