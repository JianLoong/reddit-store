I told her no, and I was surprised. She said that she doesn't have most of her food without some milk products, as she likes them apparently.\n\nShe seemed upset at that, but a few minutes later she said \"The store's still open; perhaps you can get some Shrikhand or Basundi?\" They are Indian dishes made of milk.\n\nI was confused that she wanted me to get out and buy stuff for her now, so I said \"Well, are you asking me to get out and buy milk right now?\" She said yes, and then replied with \"Don't be such a bad host, can you not even get some stuff for your girlfriend?\"\n\nI could see that my mother, who had prepared all the dishes for hours, was upset that she did not seem to like this. So I said no, and that she can have what she's got. She began to protest at that & said it doesn't even cost that much, and literally stopped having the dinner. She said my inconsideration was a turn off for her, and then left the house.\n\nShe's not talking to me and said I am a miser for not bothering to get even a single dish for her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702224196, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18f6pcu/aita_for_refusing_to_go_out_to_the_store_to_buy/", "score": 657, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she had expressed her desire for a dish ahead of time maybe where you could have more easily made the accommodation then I can kind of see that being okay, but to go to someone's house and refuse to eat and then getting upset because someone wont go out of their way in the middle of dinner to grab something else for her to eat is beyond rude. she sounds really inconsiderate and spoiled.

You mean to tell me this girl who've you've only been dating for a few months had no hesitation, no decency, and no common sense when walking into your house (mind you to meet your parents FOR THE 1ST TIME) and taking it upon herself to in a way criticize your mothers food all bc it had one thing missing knowing full dang well she could've easily been a good girlfriend and given your parents a great 1st impression by sucking it up and eatting the food!! It would've been a different story if she was allergic to anything OR the food was a texture she's physically unable to digest without the milk. But no it was just a preference she decided to be a stuck up princess about. The blatant disrespect and princess attitude towards you and your parents IN THEIR HOME is a big hell no. Be happy if she chooses to break up with you bc you definitely deserve better", "I'd have been more understanding of her insistence if it was chaas or lassi or dahi, but shrikhand and basundi? Every meal?\n\n\nNTA. One meal without your favorite foods won't harm you. She's being a diva and with recent personal experience with one of those biting my family in the ass really badly, I'm gonna advise you to kick her out of your life before she digs her claws in you more than she already has. It will save you a lot of grief later.", "NTA\n\nShe is like the American boyfriend I read about the other day who was very rude.\n\nIt is strange how so many people don\u2019t know how one is a good guest.", "My friend, NTA.  And date someone kinder and more hospitable, like your right hand.", "NTA\nAs a south indian, for me no Indian meal feels complete unless there's a side of plain yogurt at the end of the meal, and this seems to be the case for most Indian people in my life, so I can understand what Parvati means when she says she wants milk products during the meal. \n\nThat being said, it's incredibly rude as a guest to ask for the host to go out and buy something in the middle of the meal and to not appreciate the food that was made. She could've easily mentioned that to you in private after the meal, told her need for dairy to you ahead of time, or better yet even offered to bring a milk product herself as a gracious guest. There was no reason to hurt your feelings or your mother's feelings.", "I am cringing so hard & I wasnt even there. Your poor mam going to all that trouble. And this is supposed to be the honeymoon period with your girlfriend?  Man I would leave her asap.", "NTA  \n\n\nHad she warned you about this before hand it'd make more sense. But she did it on the spot and expected her demands to be met. You're better of dumping her selfish entitled ass. What she did was disrespectful.", "NTA. This is a red flag. This woman is rude and overly demanding. You need a woman who is kind and gracious. This was not appropriate behavior in front of your parents.", "NTA, your girlfriend sounds so entitled and selfish. Doesn\u2019t try the food your mom made, asking you to inconvenience yourself buy milk for one dish.", "Unless it's for a medical reason, I don't see why someone absolutely HAS to have something incorporated into their meal. We meal without mulk will not kill her. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  and she sounds rather entitled and rude.    \n\n\nwhen one is invited for a dinner they are gracious about what is served and never demand something else like she did.   \n\n\nyou may want to reconsider dating this person.   in the future it could be \"go buy me this jewelry\" and if you don't, she'll have an epic hissy fit about it.", "Is this a real post? Sounds super fishy to me. How would the guy not know that his girlfriend has this milk requirement? Why is he just discovering this in the middle of dinner with his parents?\n\nAnd also - Indian family meeting a girlfriend and then the gf acting like this. Asking to go out in the middle of dinner. It all sounds very weird. \n\nThe ONLY reasonable explanation would be that the girl wanted to break up. But then, why go meet the parents in the first place? Something isn\u2019t adding up here.\n\nPS: I\u2019m Indian. Since everyone assumes that all Redditors are white Americans I felt that this context is important for my comment.", "NTA", "Wow!  You can find somebody better that that.  She has no manners and disrespected you and your family.", "NTA\n\nYou dodged at bullet.\n\nA modest request would have been fitting. Her trying to do a power move just showed her real character.", "NTA. She was rude and entitled.", "NTA. U dont go to someones home and after meals are prepared demand someone go out to buy you a different meal. Poor excuse for a reasonable human.", "NTA. If all the dishes contained milk and she couldn\u2019t have milk, that would be a valid reason to get her a special dish. Not because they don\u2019t contain milk.", "NTA. Taking all emotion out of it: asking someone to leave the house and get you something as you are all literally sitting down to eat is not an acceptable ask. I would really just set aside everything but the basics of that fact, dismiss out of hand all her attempts to discuss or argue about it which don't begin and end with her behaviour being out of line REGARDLESS of how anything you or anyone else did or said made her feel.", "Nta - she should have brought the dessert if she was craving it.  This is a power move to let your mom know that she is now in power.  \n\nThis will be never ending power struggle with her.  She could have ordered it uber eats if she really wanted it.  No reason for you to leave as host to buy a last minute request.\n\nShe was a terrible, demanding guest.  Even worse, she made a horrible first impression on your mom. Now its on her to apoligize to you and your family to make up for leaving the house in a hissy.", "NTA the polite thjng for her to do would be to just eat what your mother made. But also when having guests for the first time people generally ask is there things you like/don\u2019t like/ are allergic to because they want to make a good first impression.", "She made you a favor. Her manners are horrible. She is an entitled brat. Don't talk to her ever again.", "She is a rude entitled asshole.  Get away before you are committed to this toxic person who will make you and your family miserable", "Oh boy that\u2019s awful! My partner is of a different nationality than I am, in his county the meals are made with a LOT of flavour and various spices! Now my problem is I was raised in a bad way so my relationship with food is also pretty bad as a result. My partner explained why I have a bad relationship with food to his mother and every time we go over his mum always makes a huge plate full of chicken schnitzels incase I might not like it. His mother is an absolute diamond, I really do love her so much! I\u2019m speaking to a therapist about a nutritionist so I can battle the problems I\u2019m having with food! \n\nWhat your girlfriend did was just purely disrespectful towards you and your mother.", "Wow. You can do better. She will\nMake your life miserable.", "\n\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28\n\n\nN\nT\nA", "NTA. If you have been dating her for a few months did you not know she ate only milk products? Seems weird that she all of a sudden decided to only eat that. Either way, she\u2019s very rude especially when your parents were there and your mom cooked all day!! You might try finding a new girlfriend because the current one has no manners and walked out on you over milk. Good grief.", "Wow, NTA\n\nGood thing you found about this only a few months into the relationship; easy to just let her go.", "Hell nah", "Typical Parvati! Pshhh.", "Anyone else hear that bullet go by OP? Just missed him! \n\nNTA", "Yeah, this was such a weird power move. I get sussing out the vibe between your male partner and his mother, but this is just stupid.", "Yeah. Who does that? It\u2019s not just insulting to the host, it\u2019s rude and inconsiderate. I\u2019d be mortified to ever bring that woman around my mother again.", "It was one dinner to meet your parents. She could have had water.", "All dietary restrictions need to be discussed as soon as the invitation is issued.", "Exactly! If you really want to get to know a person, pay close attention to the way they treat strangers.", "*She also can\u2019t not be a piece of shizz.", "Sometimes peeps bring dessert or wine to dinner.  Seems It might have been ok to talk about that before.", "Yogurt, milk-solid based desserts such as - Kheer, Rasmalai, Rasgolla, gulan jamun etc", "The only reasonable thing I can think of is that they're eating spicy food and she has a low spice tolerance and \"needs\" the milk.", "FYI, curd/sweet curd like Shrikhand or lassi are digestive aids. Many Indians have it regularly with our meals.", "Not even drink if I'm reading this right, she was expecting him to buy milk dishes, at least google shows both mentioned names being food. In other words, OPs mother spend hours cooking and then the girlfriend wants OP to buy some milk dishes from the store instead, as the good is apparently not good enough for her? No wonder his mother looked upset after putting all that effort into it, that's one heck of an entitled and rude girlfriend.", "Both shrikhand and basundi are sweet dishes. I cannot imagine anyone eating them to relive a spicy dish. This is very strange behaviour.", "It's absolutely not cultural by any stretch of the word. It's so bizarre!", "She was invited over for family dinner. Then mother prepared the food already. Also the GF couldve gone to the store herself.", "I honestly can't see the gf's perspective. Imagine being so self-centered that you demand someone leave their home and buy you dessert. It's silly.\n\nThis isn't a case of \"oh, can you pick this up on the way home?\", it's \"I know you have guests in your home but I demand you leave them and buy me something.\" It's entitled on a massive level.", "She asked this during dinner while meeting OPs parents, and then she left", "OP's mother already prepared, made and served the food. If the GF wanted something else she shouldve said so earlier. Also just because it works for your relationship doesn't mean it works for others. Every relationship is different. She also couldve gone to the store herself.", "This is like..the opposite of a restriction though", "This isn't a dietary restriction. She wanted extra milk products *in addition* to the dinner that was being provided. She wasn't about to go hungry, this was just some weird ass power move", "In this case, the dietary restriction was \u2018I can only eat specific dishes I decide I want at the spur of the moment\u2019. There wasn\u2019t anything being served she couldn\u2019t eat, she just prefers creamy sauces.\nNTA - she disrespected your mother in your mother\u2019s home the very first time they met. She was deliberately making you choose between them, and you chose correctly. Good for you!", "Thank you.", "I just wanted to make sure before saying she was absolutely a nightmare and OP should take her behavior as an indication of who she really is. I\u2019d run so far and fast you\u2019d see that cartoon steak of fire in my wake.", "You didn\u2019t read my comment at all.", "I think you\u2019re exaggerating. Yes she was rude after his question which is why ESH, but it quite literally was \u201cperhaps could\nYou get *insert the two desserts*\u201d kept in mind this is in another language being translated so the translation could be inaccurate as well. I don\u2019t think she was wrong to ask I think she was wrong in her response.", "I was explaining my perspective and why I gave an ESH vote. Her response was very rude but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an asshole for asking for dessert.", "Dietary...attraction?", "That's totally understandable. I hope OP runs away too", "I did read your comment. Also the GF couldve brought it herself. Introduce the parents to a new kind of dish.", "She is in someone else's house and asking for some store-bought food that can be eaten any other day \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80", "Where does it say that she was asking for dessert?", "You didn\u2019t read my comment at *all* if you\u2019re still trying to double down on *your* comment that isn\u2019t relative to mine. -facepalm-", "The dishes she asked for are deserts.", "Oh my apologies\ud83d\ude05. But i think she still couldve brought it with her if she likes it and maybe introduce a new dessert to OP's parents.", "It was too late. She had asked if they had anything after. Op knows about them it\u2019s not anything new and that\u2019s where my opinion stems from. Shes the assholr for how she went about it not for asking. I don\u2019t think his communication wasn\u2019t too good initially either which is where my second verdict comes from. In my relationship we always compromise \u201cmaybe later\u201d \u201cmaybe after\u201d \u201cI can walk with you after to get some\u201d I don\u2019t feel like his mom would\u2019ve felt hurt that way either.\n\nTheres no option for a you both suck but she sucks the most, so I put esh because I feel like her response was rude and they both could\u2019ve approached it better"]}
