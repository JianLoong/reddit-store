Him rejecting lap dances is implying pretty clearly that he will be present to deny them in the first place.\n\nHe told you he was going right there. You should have clarified, not assumed. \n\nThat said, he knew how you felt and attended anyway. I think strip shows and similar are just crappy and while I don't know if I'd ban my husband (it's never come up), I would hope he would recognize my discomfort and just skip it. But your husband offered a decent compromise, really. There with his buddy but keeping it to eyes only. \n\nWhy the fuck are strippers still a thing for bachelor parties anyway? Stupidest shit ever. If you're so sad about monogamy, maybe don't marry it?", "Next time he won't mention the strippers", "INFO: Was this his bachelor party ? Or one of his friends ?\n\n>declining everything and wouldn\u2019t do anything meant he wouldn\u2019t attend the show at all.\n\nYou misunderstood. He just told you he would decline having strippers come near him (for lap dance, private dance, or something else).", "YTA\n\nAlthough unintentional, you assumed in your mind (probably for comfort) that hubby wasn't going to attend when he really said he wouldn't participate. You should have asked further clarifying questions. \n\nI'm also guessing hubby was a bit vague because he didn't want to argue about it. \n\nBut at the end of the day - it's a bachelor party and strippers are usually a part of the fun. He didn't fuck them, or get a lap dance, and probably sees worse while watching porn. \n\nTo clarify - if he explicitly said he wouldn't attend, it would be a different response. However, because you heard what you wanted to and didn't clarify, it makes you the a-hole.", "I get going to a stripclub but taking the strippers \"home\" just screams trouble to me. Why would you do that? I would be uncomfortable. \n\nYou told him previously that youre not comfertable with him going to strip shows. Now he brings it up last minute while he is in Colorado? He knew about the strippers but decided not to tell you. You dont just book a show, thats preplanned. People are saying that he compromised but that's BS. Just sitting in the house while the strippers strip is not a compromise. But yeah NTA.", "For further context, my husband attended another bachelor party a year prior and did receive a lap dance and said \u201che didn\u2019t have a choice in the matter\u201d which to me is BS. I am clearly aware the strippers and strip clubs are a part of bachelor parties and didn\u2019t have an issue with any of it until that incident happened.", "NAH, but I feel like you're not taking the reality of his situation into account. He traveled for a bachelor party for a close friend of his. He's presumably hanging out with many of his friends in a group setting. You're uncomfortable with him interacting with strippers. Fair. So he said he wouldn't interact with them, he wouldn't get any dances or do anything. But you're saying that's not enough, he needed to physically leave the room and hide out by himself while the event was happening.\n\nThis is a big ask, and one that I can understand why he'd be uncomfortable with. You're asking him to tell his group of friends that he can't even hang out with them during this activity and has to go sit by himself in another room because his wife said so. Again, you're allowed to have your boundaries, but obviously that could be an uncomfortable/embarrassing thing for him to have to do in a group friend setting.\n\nImagine if you were on a girls trip and he said he was uncomfortable with you going to the club because men would be hitting on you, and that you saying you wouldn't interact with men wasn't enough, he wanted you to stay at the hotel that night and miss out on time with your friends. Regardless of how you feel about strippers, asking him to leave an activity is a big ask.", "NTA. He knows he fucked up, so he\u2019s trying to turn the tables on you. He\u2019s mad you told him to go back to Colorado? No he\u2019s not. He\u2019s mad that you are holding him accountable for doing what  he said he wouldn\u2019t do. You are NTA for telling him to go back to Colorado.", "NTA. You were very clear about how you felt about the situation prior to the event.", "I think that he made it clear that he was going to go but would just watch. So, he didn't break an agreement; however, I think that people in relationships who go to strip clubs or attend private events lack respect for their partners, especially when the partner objects. If this is a one off, I'd just make it clear in a calm conversation how it makes you feel and state that you don't approve. As for watching women take their clothes off to \"support\" their friend... what a load of hooey.", "NTA. personnaly i dont think its such a big deal but i would still respect my wife wishes if it was bothering her that much. i dont get why seeing fake tits is more important than his wife feelings it just seem like a huge red flag.", "Nta. You need to enforce any boundaries you set or he will stomp all over them. Not being ok with your partner engaging with sex workers is reasonable. You should have said up front if you stand a private party with strippers then we will be in therapy, then we may divorce, then xxx and let him live with the consequences. He's broken your trust and hurt you and that needs to be addressed. He needs to explore why he needed to be involved in the part of the trip with sex workers and why that was more important than your feelings.", "NTA.\n\nYou expressed a boundary. You essentially let him know that you expected for him to ditch his friend, that you were uncomfortable and anxious with the idea of him in that environment, and that you expected to be prioritized over his pal, and if necessary, remove himself from the rest of the bachelor party and wedding.\n\nWhether or not the friend would understand, your expectation is that he would be willing to nuke that friendship to make you feel comfortable. He failed that expectation, so now you are following through and nuking  the relationship yourself. Banishing him back to another state is a pretty clear cut escalation of your intent.\n\nJust following through on your boundaries, no matter the cost. Reasonable enough I suppose, if that's what you want.", ">\u201cwouldn\u2019t get a lap dance, he would decline everything, and wouldn\u2019t do anything\u201d\n\nsounds to me like he wouldn't leave the air bnb when the strippers get their, but that he would not interact with them. \n\nNAH/ESH", "NTA you had this boundary set early on and you reinforced it before he even went to the strip club. And rather declining the invite because you are uncomfortable with it, he decided to go anyway. And most likely did have something happen.", "YTA\n\n  \n\n\nYou made assumptions about what \"wouldn't do anything\" means, in his mind that means he wouldn't interact with them, in yours that means he wouldn't attend.", "NTA\n\nYou expressed your boundaries very clearly. He chose to ignore them. Your comments on this were fair and justified.\n\nIt wasn't just going to a strip club. They came back to their Airbnb for a private show. That's significantly different than it being \"just\" a strip club.\n\nTaking issue with that like OP did is not being jealous or overly controlling.", "INFO - What would you do if you attended a bachelorette party where strippers are going to perform and you think it's not a big deal, but your husband says he's not really comfortable... would you leave in the middle of the last night of the party, or would you tell your husband you want to stay for the last big night and that there's nothing to worry about, because he can trust you not to make bad choices?\n\nHave you ever been to a strip club, guys or girls?", "NTA. \n\nBachelor parties are fucking revolting and you were well within your rights to not be comfortable with him being around strippers. He blatantly disregarded your boundaries.", "I understand your issue with it and why you'd be mad. Communication wasn't great and both you and him could've been more clear about what you wanted. That being said him telling you about the show and what his boundaries were was a good sign for him being faithful. Many lesser men would've just not mentioned the strip show and never told you about it so at least there's that. Honestly just remember clear communication is key. In the end both are slightly ESH.", "ESH \nYTA: clearly he didn\u2019t understand what you meant. You should probably discus expectations and boundaries before he left! You can\u2019t be mad at him for not reading his mind! \nNTA: women having boundaries in a relationship doesn\u2019t mean they are controlling or as many others put it \u201cinsecure\u201d. You aren\u2019t wrong for not wanting him to go see strippers. If that\u2019s a boundary for you that\u2019s fine and he should respect it but it\u2019s up to you to establish the boundary and not expect him to be a mind reader", "YTA, based on what you wrote, he never said he wouldn't attend the strip show. \n\nI think strip shows are gross, whether the strippers are female or male, but that's how his group of friend's choose to have their bachelor parties, and he literally married you! Why are you worried about him seeing a bunch of scantily dressed women who are getting paid to take their clothes off?", "YTA for playing mind games with your husband. If you asked him not to attend, and he did anyway, he WOULD be the asshole, but sounds like he offered a compromise, you made assumptions, and are mad that your assumption was incorrect.", "I was going to say E S H but after seeing your responses to people it's definitely YTA\n\nhis response immediately struck in my mind as 'he's attending just not participating'\n\nhe said that to you, you agreed with him and seemed chill about it, he comes back home and you're telling him to go fuck off \n\nit sounds like a miscommunication because he was under the impression you both agreed but in this case i will say your reddit name seems pretty fitting", "NTA. And honestly, I suspect he's not mad at you for saying \"go back to Colorado\", he's mad at himself for doing the very thing he said he wouldn't and he's lashing out at you because he can't lash out at himself.", "YTA.\n\n\"I'll decline everything\" means \"no lap dances, blow jobs, or sex\", not \"I'm not going to go\".\n\nGrow up. If you didn't want your husband to go you should have explicitly told him you didn't want him to go. Not this wishy-washy \"I'm not comfortable\" business.", "NTA\n\n\"I'm not comfortable with you gong to strip shows.\"\n\n\"Ok. But I'll go anyway.\"\n\nAnd then somehow you being angry about something you stated you weren't happy about is a goddamn surprise.\n\nAlso I am a dude and I don't get \"strip club culture\" and I'm not even going to pretend I do, I'd break up to find out my partner was going to strip clubs.", "YTA. he never said he wouldn't be there, just that he wouldn't engage/participate. you assumed he wouldn't be there even though he never said that. it's okay to be upset he was there, but it's not okay to tell him to go back to colorado when he made it clear he'd be there but not engage with the strippers. apologize, and in the future if he doesn't explicitly say he won't be at some event don't assume he will be just because he said he won't do anything. honestly, what he said gives no indication he won't attend.\n\nyou 100% misinterpreted something that was pretty clear. he let you know what was happening and that he wouldn't be engaging, he did everything right on his end. you don't have to be happy with it but he didn't hide anything from you.", "NTA. It's another pervasive misogynistic ritual that is excused because 'boys will be boys.\" Ask your bf how he would feel if a male strippers laid down and you ground yourself on his erect penis until you climaxed. Same thing.", "NTA.  You have a reasonable boundary that he ignored.  Also, no, I don't believe for one second he sat and watched and didn't participate at all.  Not a chance in hell that's what happened.", "YTA - your husband told you ahead of time what was going on and he didn\u2019t engage. He was very respectful of your relationship. I\u2019ve never understood people who act like this is cheating. If he was going to the strip club alone every night, sure, I\u2019d get being mad. But he didn\u2019t plan this event and was there to support his friend getting married. You way overreacted in my opinion.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDifferent couples have different cheating definitions. You made yours clear.", "NTA, he\u2019s had lap dances before because \u2018he had no choice\u2019. Sounds like you have a history of him overstepping your boundaries, which imo are fine to have. \n\nAll you did was say to \u2018go back to Colorado\u2019. You didn\u2019t leave him there stranded or something", "NTA. He's completely disregarding you and your sense of what fidelity in the relationship looks like. I would not be comfortable with my spouse going to a strip club either, and I would consider his disregard for my already-stated opposition as grounds to consider the relationship over. A relationship that has no respect is no relationship at all.", "NTA he knew you didn't want him with the strippers they were at an airbnb which means he could have gone into a bedroom while the strippers where there he chose to disregard and disrespect you tell him he doesn't get to be mad at you because he chose to disrespect and disregard your boundaries.", "No but I think you need to make it more clear than just words. You go back, or switch hotel rooms or something, anything to show how serious you are.", "NTA. either he lied or misled you....either way it sounds like he overstepped a boundary he knew existed.", "INFO:  You keep saying \"attend a strip show\" but it was *at the place he was staying.* Did you expect him to leave or go sit in another room?\n\nIt seems like you have insecurities about the relationship and/or your body.  That's something *you* need to deal with.", "YTA, he never agreed not to go.\nYou have Insecurities and you need to address these. The strip show is a normal bachelor party thing.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't want him at the show and he ignored  you.  It takes 1 no for a  no answer and 2 yes for a yes answer.", "YTA. If he indeed didn\u2019t get a lap dance, declined everything and didn\u2019t do anything then he held on to his end of the bargain. If you didn\u2019t want him to be present at all, you should have made it clear that his promise of not getting \u201cinvolved\u201d was not enough.", "YTA. And this is a PSA for women everywhere: No. Stripper. Wants. Your. Man. \n\nIf he very explicitly said he won\u2019t be participating but will be present he\u2019s being respectful of your relationship and not trying to exclude himself from activities he TRAVELED FOR while with friends. Stop being insecure as I will repeat: no stripper wants your man (especially if he\u2019s not coughing up $$$.)", "It seems like you guys talked around each other. 'I let him know I was not happy about it' is not the same as asking him not to go. And him saying he 'would decline everything' most certainly was not the same as saying he wouldn't be going at all. It seems like you wanted him to decide not to go but didn't want to tell him not to go, so you left it up to him but ultimately there was only one choice he could make that wouldn't piss you off, which isn't very fair to him. \n\nAnd yeah, kicking him out over this, over what is effectively a miscommunication, is definitely in AH territory so I lean YTA.", "Gentle ESH.\n\nI don't think you're an AH for not wanting your hubby to be present at a strip show. I'm a bit biased against those so honestly I had to think about this one for a while. Where you fall into AH territory is simply lack of communication, on both ends. He sounded maybe a little vague but basically said he wouldn't \"technically\" cross those boundaries. You assumed that he meant something more than not getting danced on. \n\nLike I said, I don't love the \"tradition\" of stripping shows for bachelor/ette parties so I get where you're coming from. I get that you're upset, but to him, he didn't technically break his promise. I hope you guys can work through it!", "NTA.", "NTA, he absolutely disrespected your wishes. Punish him by making him go to a strip club with you as you ogle a bunch of handsome men swing their girthy, lengthy cocks around. Apparently he'll be okay with it so long as you don't touch them or get a dance.", "YTA you seem to understand that sometimes strippers are a part of bachelor parties, so if you want him to leave the party entirely when strippers show up, you should state that clearly.\n\nIt seems he compromised as far as he could without having to outright leave, and you heard what you wanted to hear.\n\nUp till now he seems to have been very honest to you about it all, but be aware that your own behavior could be what leads him to lie to the next time, just to avoid a fight.", "YTA.  Question of whether or not it makes sense to be upset about your husband attending a bachelor party and trying to make him remove himself from the home during the party, your comment was petty and intended to be.  If the shoe was on the other foot and you made him mad and he said, \u201cnext time, just don\u2019t come home\u201d, how would you feel?", "YTA, you sound abusive,  and controlling.  You both agreed to the bachelor party,  and then threw a fit about it when he returned.  So yes,  that makes you the AH. Your responses here come off as unhinged.", "YTA just bc you are uncomfortable does me he should do normal bachelor party things. Get over it strippers are not a  big deal", "YTA it doesn\u2019t sound like he broke his end of the deal.

Why marry someone who you can\u2019t trust? You need to see someone about your issues.", "YTA. Jealousy is an ugly problem and on you, not your husband.

Your husband is NTA", "YTA - Time for you to get over your insecurities, if you were secure in yourself and in your relationship, you would have no reason to be uncomfortable with this situation.  Unresolved insecurities are a sure fire way of self sabotaging your relationship, they never go away unless you work on them, they only get worse, and eventually will be the cause of the divorce.\n\nHe promised you he wouldn't interact at the show, but never promised he would remove himself from it.", "ESH. As a man, I gotta say you should be very specific and tell him explicitly when you don't want him doing something. Your husband really should've taken the hint and not gone at all, but he may have felt social pressure to go and decided to attend but not participate as a sort of compromise option.", "Eh esh. You told him how you felt. HOWEVER this was a batchelor party. Marriage means you have to compromise i also have issues with that to, but my husband says your husband probably only got to see a little bit of boobs but the reality is he still came home to you. We all have insecurities this is one of those let it go moments because you can't do anything about it but you do need to apologize for picking a fight. A lap dance is the same as him looking at playboy, or porn we all have to decide what hill to die on", "Are we sure nothing happened there? Idk, if it was me I would be paranoid af lol, nta", "YTA.

The first question you need to ask yourself is why you don't trust your husband? If the answer is that he's given you reason not to through his actions in the past, then your reaction is much more understandable. If he's never done anything like that in the past and never given you reason to think that he would, then your reaction signals major insecurity on your part, and you might want to consider talking to a therapist about it.", "But he specifically said that wouldn't happen. And it didn't happen. He watched a strip show. He didn't get a lap dance. He told you all of this as well, so I just don't understand your POV.\n\nYes, it sucks that he had a lap dance a year ago that you weren't comfortable with. I'm sorry for that. But that didn't happen here, and you want to punish him for something that didn't happen, because you made an assumption that \"turning down advances\" is equivalent to \"not attending at all\", which simply isn't true.\n\nSoftly, but YTA", "So you don't trust your husband to respect his own body and your marriage enough to keep strippers from touching him?

Nor a woman for her bachelorette party. I gave my judgement, you don't have to agree. What I will say, given you have asked another person why you would want your parter seeing a stripper - choice. If I was so insecure that my partner seeing another woman strip (which is a job) is a problem, I need to reflect on my own needs.", "\u2026 you want an echo chamber.\n\nThe people have spoken. YTA.", "I'm not being funny right but your insecurities has nothing to do with him... your insecurities are a YOU problem and not a HIM problem...he didn't get involved... bet you would call him an asshole if he didn't want you going to a bachelorette party that was going to have male strippers there... double standards that would be huni... deal with you insecurities and stop putting them on your partner", "Sorry I wasn\u2019t clear; why is him attending an issue? Like why does that make you uncomfortable and unhappy. \n\nLike it\u2019s your right to feel that way, but the only thing I and others on this thread can reasonably suspect is that you\u2019re massively insecure. \n\nHe\u2019s not going to hook up with a stripper, at WORST he gets a lap dance (which he said he wouldn\u2019t, and didn\u2019t) and they\u2019re not going to fall in love and run away and get married. She\u2019s quite literally being paid to entertain and be nice to him. So what is the issue? What are you so afraid of here that it makes you unhappy?", "Because your feelings about this are your feelings. You don\u2019t get to control every aspect of your partner. He\u2019s going to a party to celebrate his friend, he doesn\u2019t control the agenda. Asking him to intentionally sit out an activity that he\u2019s an observer not a participant in is incredibly awkward.", "No you're making the opposite point.

Is there so little trust that you think a stripper could test your partners loyalty? Those are the questions you would need to ask yourself. Again, it's about choice. If your partner and you agree, great for you. But if you have to force your view, it's probably worth looking into further.\nLike I said, it's pretty normal where I'm from for guys to have strippers present at a bachelor party.\nGood luck to the OP.", "Fair enough. That didn\u2019t answer my question at all, but fair enough.", "ESH. But leaning more yta. It\u2019s a performance and you purposefully misinterpreted his words. From what you wrote he clearly still intended to go, but would not participate.

Sorry pal :(", "But why would you want to have strippers celebrating your marriage? If both partners are open to it sure, but usually it\u2019s a one sided street that makes the other partner uncomfortable. I think it\u2019s less about the trust and more about the thought behind it.

Each person is entitled to their views and their choices.", "Rarely are the strippers ordered by the groom, his friends act under the guise that it's for him, when in reality strippers are typically only there for 1 or 2 of the more perverted friends who want to partake in a clich\u00e9 tradition of having \"one last hurrah!\"\n\nIn a group of 50 guys at a bachelor party only a few take the degenerate path, most will just watch from afar or even leave the room.  It's a minor part of a bachelor party", "Yeah, like technically she\u2019s allowed to feel that way but it\u2019s still shitty nonetheless. Honestly they just shouldn\u2019t be together if this has somehow manifested into such a huge issue. \n\nIn another comment she talks about how she doesn\u2019t want a stripper rubbing her vagina lips all over her man, like\u2026. 1.) he didn\u2019t even get a lap dance and said from the beginning he wouldn\u2019t and 2.) he can fall in love with the stripper but she won\u2019t love him back lmao, he\u2019s not gonna leave you for her. And even if he did, isn\u2019t that a shit relationship anyway?\n\nShe keeps dodging the question of what offends her about strippers and in other comments where people say she\u2019s insecure (which she clearly is) she tells them they\u2019re just projecting so \u2026 safe to say we have an insecure immature little girl here", "And good for you guys! But OP has expressed that it makes her uncomfortable and he should respect that, or find a partner who is comfortable with it.", "It doesn\u2019t seem quite minor for this group lol, OP said they\u2019ve had strippers at most/all (? I can\u2019t remember the comment) bachelor parties that her partner has attended"]}
