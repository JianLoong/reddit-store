Him rejecting lap dances is implying pretty clearly that he will be present to deny them in the first place.\n\nHe told you he was going right there. You should have clarified, not assumed. \n\nThat said, he knew how you felt and attended anyway. I think strip shows and similar are just crappy and while I don't know if I'd ban my husband (it's never come up), I would hope he would recognize my discomfort and just skip it. But your husband offered a decent compromise, really. There with his buddy but keeping it to eyes only. \n\nWhy the fuck are strippers still a thing for bachelor parties anyway? Stupidest shit ever. If you're so sad about monogamy, maybe don't marry it?", "Next time he won't mention the strippers", "INFO: Was this his bachelor party ? Or one of his friends ?\n\n>declining everything and wouldn\u2019t do anything meant he wouldn\u2019t attend the show at all.\n\nYou misunderstood. He just told you he would decline having strippers come near him (for lap dance, private dance, or something else).", "YTA\n\nAlthough unintentional, you assumed in your mind (probably for comfort) that hubby wasn't going to attend when he really said he wouldn't participate. You should have asked further clarifying questions. \n\nI'm also guessing hubby was a bit vague because he didn't want to argue about it. \n\nBut at the end of the day - it's a bachelor party and strippers are usually a part of the fun. He didn't fuck them, or get a lap dance, and probably sees worse while watching porn. \n\nTo clarify - if he explicitly said he wouldn't attend, it would be a different response. However, because you heard what you wanted to and didn't clarify, it makes you the a-hole.", "I get going to a stripclub but taking the strippers \"home\" just screams trouble to me. Why would you do that? I would be uncomfortable. \n\nYou told him previously that youre not comfertable with him going to strip shows. Now he brings it up last minute while he is in Colorado? He knew about the strippers but decided not to tell you. You dont just book a show, thats preplanned. People are saying that he compromised but that's BS. Just sitting in the house while the strippers strip is not a compromise. But yeah NTA.", "For further context, my husband attended another bachelor party a year prior and did receive a lap dance and said \u201che didn\u2019t have a choice in the matter\u201d which to me is BS. I am clearly aware the strippers and strip clubs are a part of bachelor parties and didn\u2019t have an issue with any of it until that incident happened.", "NAH, but I feel like you're not taking the reality of his situation into account. He traveled for a bachelor party for a close friend of his. He's presumably hanging out with many of his friends in a group setting. You're uncomfortable with him interacting with strippers. Fair. So he said he wouldn't interact with them, he wouldn't get any dances or do anything. But you're saying that's not enough, he needed to physically leave the room and hide out by himself while the event was happening.\n\nThis is a big ask, and one that I can understand why he'd be uncomfortable with. You're asking him to tell his group of friends that he can't even hang out with them during this activity and has to go sit by himself in another room because his wife said so. Again, you're allowed to have your boundaries, but obviously that could be an uncomfortable/embarrassing thing for him to have to do in a group friend setting.\n\nImagine if you were on a girls trip and he said he was uncomfortable with you going to the club because men would be hitting on you, and that you saying you wouldn't interact with men wasn't enough, he wanted you to stay at the hotel that night and miss out on time with your friends. Regardless of how you feel about strippers, asking him to leave an activity is a big ask.", "NTA. He knows he fucked up, so he\u2019s trying to turn the tables on you. He\u2019s mad you told him to go back to Colorado? No he\u2019s not. He\u2019s mad that you are holding him accountable for doing what  he said he wouldn\u2019t do. You are NTA for telling him to go back to Colorado.", "NTA. You were very clear about how you felt about the situation prior to the event.", "I think that he made it clear that he was going to go but would just watch. So, he didn't break an agreement; however, I think that people in relationships who go to strip clubs or attend private events lack respect for their partners, especially when the partner objects. If this is a one off, I'd just make it clear in a calm conversation how it makes you feel and state that you don't approve. As for watching women take their clothes off to \"support\" their friend... what a load of hooey.", "NTA. personnaly i dont think its such a big deal but i would still respect my wife wishes if it was bothering her that much. i dont get why seeing fake tits is more important than his wife feelings it just seem like a huge red flag.", "Nta. You need to enforce any boundaries you set or he will stomp all over them. Not being ok with your partner engaging with sex workers is reasonable. You should have said up front if you stand a private party with strippers then we will be in therapy, then we may divorce, then xxx and let him live with the consequences. He's broken your trust and hurt you and that needs to be addressed. He needs to explore why he needed to be involved in the part of the trip with sex workers and why that was more important than your feelings.", "NTA.\n\nYou expressed a boundary. You essentially let him know that you expected for him to ditch his friend, that you were uncomfortable and anxious with the idea of him in that environment, and that you expected to be prioritized over his pal, and if necessary, remove himself from the rest of the bachelor party and wedding.\n\nWhether or not the friend would understand, your expectation is that he would be willing to nuke that friendship to make you feel comfortable. He failed that expectation, so now you are following through and nuking  the relationship yourself. Banishing him back to another state is a pretty clear cut escalation of your intent.\n\nJust following through on your boundaries, no matter the cost. Reasonable enough I suppose, if that's what you want.", ">\u201cwouldn\u2019t get a lap dance, he would decline everything, and wouldn\u2019t do anything\u201d\n\nsounds to me like he wouldn't leave the air bnb when the strippers get their, but that he would not interact with them. \n\nNAH/ESH", "NTA you had this boundary set early on and you reinforced it before he even went to the strip club. And rather declining the invite because you are uncomfortable with it, he decided to go anyway. And most likely did have something happen.", "YTA\n\n  \n\n\nYou made assumptions about what \"wouldn't do anything\" means, in his mind that means he wouldn't interact with them, in yours that means he wouldn't attend.", "NTA\n\nYou expressed your boundaries very clearly. He chose to ignore them. Your comments on this were fair and justified.\n\nIt wasn't just going to a strip club. They came back to their Airbnb for a private show. That's significantly different than it being \"just\" a strip club.\n\nTaking issue with that like OP did is not being jealous or overly controlling.", "INFO - What would you do if you attended a bachelorette party where strippers are going to perform and you think it's not a big deal, but your husband says he's not really comfortable... would you leave in the middle of the last night of the party, or would you tell your husband you want to stay for the last big night and that there's nothing to worry about, because he can trust you not to make bad choices?\n\nHave you ever been to a strip club, guys or girls?", "NTA. \n\nBachelor parties are fucking revolting and you were well within your rights to not be comfortable with him being around strippers. He blatantly disregarded your boundaries.", "I understand your issue with it and why you'd be mad. Communication wasn't great and both you and him could've been more clear about what you wanted. That being said him telling you about the show and what his boundaries were was a good sign for him being faithful. Many lesser men would've just not mentioned the strip show and never told you about it so at least there's that. Honestly just remember clear communication is key. In the end both are slightly ESH.", "ESH \nYTA: clearly he didn\u2019t understand what you meant. You should probably discus expectations and boundaries before he left! You can\u2019t be mad at him for not reading his mind! \nNTA: women having boundaries in a relationship doesn\u2019t mean they are controlling or as many others put it \u201cinsecure\u201d. You aren\u2019t wrong for not wanting him to go see strippers. If that\u2019s a boundary for you that\u2019s fine and he should respect it but it\u2019s up to you to establish the boundary and not expect him to be a mind reader", "YTA, based on what you wrote, he never said he wouldn't attend the strip show. \n\nI think strip shows are gross, whether the strippers are female or male, but that's how his group of friend's choose to have their bachelor parties, and he literally married you! Why are you worried about him seeing a bunch of scantily dressed women who are getting paid to take their clothes off?", "YTA for playing mind games with your husband. If you asked him not to attend, and he did anyway, he WOULD be the asshole, but sounds like he offered a compromise, you made assumptions, and are mad that your assumption was incorrect.", "I was going to say E S H but after seeing your responses to people it's definitely YTA\n\nhis response immediately struck in my mind as 'he's attending just not participating'\n\nhe said that to you, you agreed with him and seemed chill about it, he comes back home and you're telling him to go fuck off \n\nit sounds like a miscommunication because he was under the impression you both agreed but in this case i will say your reddit name seems pretty fitting", "NTA. And honestly, I suspect he's not mad at you for saying \"go back to Colorado\", he's mad at himself for doing the very thing he said he wouldn't and he's lashing out at you because he can't lash out at himself.", "YTA.\n\n\"I'll decline everything\" means \"no lap dances, blow jobs, or sex\", not \"I'm not going to go\".\n\nGrow up. If you didn't want your husband to go you should have explicitly told him you didn't want him to go. Not this wishy-washy \"I'm not comfortable\" business.", "NTA\n\n\"I'm not comfortable with you gong to strip shows.\"\n\n\"Ok. But I'll go anyway.\"\n\nAnd then somehow you being angry about something you stated you weren't happy about is a goddamn surprise.\n\nAlso I am a dude and I don't get \"strip club culture\" and I'm not even going to pretend I do, I'd break up to find out my partner was going to strip clubs.", "YTA. he never said he wouldn't be there, just that he wouldn't engage/participate. you assumed he wouldn't be there even though he never said that. it's okay to be upset he was there, but it's not okay to tell him to go back to colorado when he made it clear he'd be there but not engage with the strippers. apologize, and in the future if he doesn't explicitly say he won't be at some event don't assume he will be just because he said he won't do anything. honestly, what he said gives no indication he won't attend.\n\nyou 100% misinterpreted something that was pretty clear. he let you know what was happening and that he wouldn't be engaging, he did everything right on his end. you don't have to be happy with it but he didn't hide anything from you.", "NTA. It's another pervasive misogynistic ritual that is excused because 'boys will be boys.\" Ask your bf how he would feel if a male strippers laid down and you ground yourself on his erect penis until you climaxed. Same thing.", "NTA.  You have a reasonable boundary that he ignored.  Also, no, I don't believe for one second he sat and watched and didn't participate at all.  Not a chance in hell that's what happened.", "YTA - your husband told you ahead of time what was going on and he didn\u2019t engage. He was very respectful of your relationship. I\u2019ve never understood people who act like this is cheating. If he was going to the strip club alone every night, sure, I\u2019d get being mad. But he didn\u2019t plan this event and was there to support his friend getting married. You way overreacted in my opinion.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDifferent couples have different cheating definitions. You made yours clear.", "NTA, he\u2019s had lap dances before because \u2018he had no choice\u2019. Sounds like you have a history of him overstepping your boundaries, which imo are fine to have. \n\nAll you did was say to \u2018go back to Colorado\u2019. You didn\u2019t leave him there stranded or something", "NTA. He's completely disregarding you and your sense of what fidelity in the relationship looks like. I would not be comfortable with my spouse going to a strip club either, and I would consider his disregard for my already-stated opposition as grounds to consider the relationship over. A relationship that has no respect is no relationship at all.", "NTA he knew you didn't want him with the strippers they were at an airbnb which means he could have gone into a bedroom while the strippers where there he chose to disregard and disrespect you tell him he doesn't get to be mad at you because he chose to disrespect and disregard your boundaries.", "No but I think you need to make it more clear than just words. You go back, or switch hotel rooms or something, anything to show how serious you are.", "NTA. either he lied or misled you....either way it sounds like he overstepped a boundary he knew existed.", "INFO:  You keep saying \"attend a strip show\" but it was *at the place he was staying.* Did you expect him to leave or go sit in another room?\n\nIt seems like you have insecurities about the relationship and/or your body.  That's something *you* need to deal with.", "YTA, he never agreed not to go.\nYou have Insecurities and you need to address these. The strip show is a normal bachelor party thing.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't want him at the show and he ignored  you.  It takes 1 no for a  no answer and 2 yes for a yes answer.", "YTA. If he indeed didn\u2019t get a lap dance, declined everything and didn\u2019t do anything then he held on to his end of the bargain. If you didn\u2019t want him to be present at all, you should have made it clear that his promise of not getting \u201cinvolved\u201d was not enough.", "YTA. And this is a PSA for women everywhere: No. Stripper. Wants. Your. Man. \n\nIf he very explicitly said he won\u2019t be participating but will be present he\u2019s being respectful of your relationship and not trying to exclude himself from activities he TRAVELED FOR while with friends. Stop being insecure as I will repeat: no stripper wants your man (especially if he\u2019s not coughing up $$$.)", "It seems like you guys talked around each other. 'I let him know I was not happy about it' is not the same as asking him not to go. And him saying he 'would decline everything' most certainly was not the same as saying he wouldn't be going at all. It seems like you wanted him to decide not to go but didn't want to tell him not to go, so you left it up to him but ultimately there was only one choice he could make that wouldn't piss you off, which isn't very fair to him. \n\nAnd yeah, kicking him out over this, over what is effectively a miscommunication, is definitely in AH territory so I lean YTA.", "Gentle ESH.\n\nI don't think you're an AH for not wanting your hubby to be present at a strip show. I'm a bit biased against those so honestly I had to think about this one for a while. Where you fall into AH territory is simply lack of communication, on both ends. He sounded maybe a little vague but basically said he wouldn't \"technically\" cross those boundaries. You assumed that he meant something more than not getting danced on. \n\nLike I said, I don't love the \"tradition\" of stripping shows for bachelor/ette parties so I get where you're coming from. I get that you're upset, but to him, he didn't technically break his promise. I hope you guys can work through it!", "NTA.", "NTA, he absolutely disrespected your wishes. Punish him by making him go to a strip club with you as you ogle a bunch of handsome men swing their girthy, lengthy cocks around. Apparently he'll be okay with it so long as you don't touch them or get a dance.", "YTA you seem to understand that sometimes strippers are a part of bachelor parties, so if you want him to leave the party entirely when strippers show up, you should state that clearly.\n\nIt seems he compromised as far as he could without having to outright leave, and you heard what you wanted to hear.\n\nUp till now he seems to have been very honest to you about it all, but be aware that your own behavior could be what leads him to lie to the next time, just to avoid a fight.", "YTA.  Question of whether or not it makes sense to be upset about your husband attending a bachelor party and trying to make him remove himself from the home during the party, your comment was petty and intended to be.  If the shoe was on the other foot and you made him mad and he said, \u201cnext time, just don\u2019t come home\u201d, how would you feel?", "YTA, you sound abusive,  and controlling.  You both agreed to the bachelor party,  and then threw a fit about it when he returned.  So yes,  that makes you the AH. Your responses here come off as unhinged.", "YTA just bc you are uncomfortable does me he should do normal bachelor party things. Get over it strippers are not a  big deal", "YTA it doesn\u2019t sound like he broke his end of the deal.

Why marry someone who you can\u2019t trust? You need to see someone about your issues.", "YTA. Jealousy is an ugly problem and on you, not your husband.

Your husband is NTA", "YTA - Time for you to get over your insecurities, if you were secure in yourself and in your relationship, you would have no reason to be uncomfortable with this situation.  Unresolved insecurities are a sure fire way of self sabotaging your relationship, they never go away unless you work on them, they only get worse, and eventually will be the cause of the divorce.\n\nHe promised you he wouldn't interact at the show, but never promised he would remove himself from it.", "ESH. As a man, I gotta say you should be very specific and tell him explicitly when you don't want him doing something. Your husband really should've taken the hint and not gone at all, but he may have felt social pressure to go and decided to attend but not participate as a sort of compromise option.", "Eh esh. You told him how you felt. HOWEVER this was a batchelor party. Marriage means you have to compromise i also have issues with that to, but my husband says your husband probably only got to see a little bit of boobs but the reality is he still came home to you. We all have insecurities this is one of those let it go moments because you can't do anything about it but you do need to apologize for picking a fight. A lap dance is the same as him looking at playboy, or porn we all have to decide what hill to die on", "Are we sure nothing happened there? Idk, if it was me I would be paranoid af lol, nta", "YTA.

It was 100% bs that he said he couldn't do anything about that. And if for some reason he truly couldn't, he should not be attending that kind of show anyway because what will stop his friends from pushing him into an uncomfortable situation again? Honestly, the \"strippers being part of the fun\" at bachelor parties is something a lot of soon to be brides wouldn't let fly if they knew, and rightfully so. I think that's just a dumb excuse for people to use, because I don't think the future grooms at those parties would be cool if their brides to be were getting lap dances from male strippers either. You do not have to be okay with your partner being around strippers with other people who will likely encourage them to participate, and that goes both ways. Trust doesn't mean boundaries should be allowed to be violated just because you should \"just trust your partner\". That being said, you should have specified that you didn't want him to go at all though, because honestly if you don't trust him to go at all, you need to make that incredibly clear that this isn't something you wanted him attending. You don't have to be okay with your partner attending parties with strippers, and you don't have to trust somebody who's broken that trust in the past, but you can't assume X=Y and say that because he said he wouldn't participate that it means he isn't going at all.

Everyone finds others attractive at some point, even within a relationship, but there's no need to go out of your way to see strippers, especially if you know your partner would not be comfortable with it.

The entire point of a sex workers is, gasp, about sex, so OP enforcing boundaries does not make her a bigot", "I'm sorry, but how is a live, private strip show not engaging with them in a sexual manner?", "Try this thought out on guys  Let me know how it goes. \ud83d\ude01\n\nAs long as this is SUCH an INNOCENT activity they should be fine with their woman stripping for other men while they are not there, right?  Right?", "And that never happened so what\u2019s the issue?", "There\u2019s a difference between uncomfortable and a boundary. Some people are uncomfortable when their partner dresses provocatively, but every time that\u2019s brought up people are like \u201cget over it, it\u2019s their body\u201d. What\u2019s the difference here?", "No it\u2019s not. People can be uncomfortable if their partner shows too much cleavage, that\u2019s not a boundary. That\u2019s a feeling.", "Why do I feel like he\u2019s trying to turn the tables on you?", "Why do I feel like he\u2019s trying to turn the tables on you?", "Why do I feel like he\u2019s trying to turn the tables on you?", "If I was invited away and told that there would be a strip show at the BnB, I wouldn't go at all.  It's a pretty sleazy setup.\n\n(I don't understand bachelor parties like this.  You are getting married presumably because you love and desire your partner.  But hey, let's plan to get turned on by (and potentially fuck) a complete stranger!)", ">IMO if the guy was planning on, even if he thought it was a remote possibility, doing something other than just be there for his friend\u2019s bachelor party, he probably wouldn\u2019t have even told his wife about the strippers being there.\n\nA lot of cheating isn't planned though. People get drunk or high, they push boundaries a little, get a little wound up, and then...stuff happens.   \n\n\nYou see a LOT of stories on here of people going \"whoops, I never intended to fuck that stripper/my ex/whatever before my weddng, but now it happened and i don't know how to tell my partner\"", "Obviously that commenter and the wife in this post *aren't* okay with it. \n\nIt's like any other preference in potential partners.", "Yeah fair. Really can't expect this sub to be even slightly related to reality or sane", "Except that's not what you said. You said you have no problem with it but think anyone who partakes is wrong. It's ok you can just admit you are a hypocrite with illogical stances just to make yourself feel better. We all know already", "for sure. OP mentioned strippers typical for the bachelor parties of the particular men in this group - i think this was the 4th - so it should've been expected. OP's husband didn't have to mention what their plan was, but they did and they mentioned they'd do no more than watch. bachelor parties are usually the exception to strippers and strip clubs because it's very typical. \n\nthe biggest issue here is trust and insecurities. OP's wife doesn't trust their husband and is likely to be insecure over the situation as well - those are almost always the reasons someone doesn't want their partner around strippers.", "You don't say", "And hallmark movies skew people's perspectives of relationships. \n\nAnything can be bad when taken with the wrong context", "Sex with my wife rarely resembles anything one might see in porn. Sex with my girlfriend however...", "This is hilarious because my youngest has a clear problem with snacks lol", "You're not uncomfortable at all that your husband uses the visual image of other women's bodies to get off? How can you be certain when you 2 do it, he doesn't need to imagine his internet memories to cum with you?", "Perhaps you're referring to OP's husband, not this one leaving the comment?", "To be fair, it would have to be attractive men that they are stripping for to be an equal scenario. It\u2019s attractive women stripping for them, so it would have to be attractive men she\u2019s stripping for to be an equally titillating experience for her :)", "It doesn\u2019t sound like she should trust him based on his current and past behavior. Reddit is weird- like yes, trust is important in a relationship, that\u2019s why people shouldn\u2019t BREAK the trust! It\u2019s not \u201ctrust is important in a relationship, so you should trust your SO even when they break your trust\u201d", "It doesn\u2019t necessarily say a lot about her, but a lot about her husband.", "A stripper has never had sex with a client. Nope never.", "The difference is that not wanting your partner to wear certain clothes versus not wanting him to watch strippers are completely different asks. When we say \"respect your partners' wishes\", that doesn't mean everything and anything your partner asks. The line has to be drawn somewhere to separate overly controlling behavior, and for a lot of people, strip shows is an acceptable prohibition", "You're comparing apples and oranges here. One is because of a certain dressing style, the other is an actual activity that men are encouraged to join in on and regularly do. Just say you condone cheating and move on.", "I don\u2019t blame my actions on being drunk/high. Maybe I\u2019ll run my mouth a little more if I\u2019ve been drinking.

That\u2019s why porn still bothers with scripts, or even just titles.", "Yes, I was unclear.", "Not arguing with you there. \nBut stripping for rich, successful, high status men might give your guy more of the same feeling. \n\nNo, I take that back. Of course it wouldn't. I mean, it is not like he is INSECURE.", "Lololololol if you honestly think your partner isn't looking st other people they find attractive you are completely delusional.

I think we could start a new billion dollar business venture! Couldn\u2019t be that hard to find these guys to watch women strip and feed them compliments for $. We just need to convince women that it\u2019s just totally normal and natural and a good way to blow off steam when they\u2019re looking for something more in their sex lives- questioning husbands are just controlling insecure jealous children that need to GROW UP! I mean just because you\u2019re together doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to stop enjoying the sexual gaze of other men. Jeez.", "Well of course, but why would they pay to look at other people when they have a partner. Especially if your partner has communicated their sexual boundaries to you", "Straw man.\nMake the argument about something else, shift the blame. \nPure manipulation.\nGreat that hubby has so many manipulative bros having his back. He won't be too lonely after the divorce even if he mostly will hang out with trash", "Why would they not? It's entertaining and it's just nudity.\n\n>their sexual boundaries to you\n\nYou seem confused on boundaries as do many people. A boundry is personal, it's not something you get to impose on others. A boundry can be that YOU don't look at naked people. A boundry could be that YOU don't allow strippers in your home. A boundry cannot be that someone else doesn't look at naked people because you don't like it. Your boundaries do not get to interfere with other people's actions and behaviors when they do not directly involve you.", "Shifting the blame, exactly. I hate how in the past few years insecure has become an insult people are so quick to throw out to shame anyone for setting a boundary in a relationship. Why are people acting like it would\u2019ve been so odd to step out of the room? It could just be a simple \u201cI\u2019m gonna go hang out in there, you guys have fun though! Let me know when it\u2019s wrapped up.\u201d The other guys likely wouldn\u2019t have even cared, maybe teased him a bit but they have their other friends and they still get to focus on the strippers. Sad that people think him respecting his wife would\u2019ve made a some big awkward scene.", "\"I am not comfortable having a partner who looks at other naked people,\" is 100% a boundary. Your partner doesn't have to respect that, and if they don't you should find a new partner (and vice versa, if you want to look at strippers, you need a partner who is comfortable with that).", "It has because it has been an effective way to silence women's protests. \"If you protest you are weak,  insecure, jealous,  ugly, controlling...\"\n\nNot: \"If he does this he is not any decent guy, he is selfish and disrespecting you when he does not care how you feel\"", "They are fighting for normalizing married men going to strip clubs.\n\nI'm not touching a guy like that even with a stick."]}
