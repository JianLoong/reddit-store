You are very delusional about your parenting skills.", "You obviously don't know them that well then.", "YTA - for leaving your child unattended with glass bottles so they could throw the bottle at other kids. \n\nYour attending an end of school party for 7 year olds. What I want to know is what was more important at this children\u2019s party than watching your kid? You were probably preaching about the benefits of Mexican coke over coke while your kid was trying to seriously injure others with the Mexican coke bottles. \n\nI\u2019ve read a lot of posts from bad parents on this sub, but I have never read anything like this. Watch your kids.", "So you were asked about giving children *glass bottles* and went off on your misinformed little side rant about pop? \n\nShe was asking why you thought it was a good idea to put something dangerous in the hands of kiddos. She wasn\u2019t asking about your malarkey about \u201chealthy\u201d pop. \n\nYou can blame others all you like, make all the excuses you want but the bottom line is *you* are the problem. \n\nAlso YTA", "The worst part is that OP states in thei post that it was true that their child was the one leading it.", "I got the same feeling, tbh.

Blaming others for everything they do wrong.", "You could've been n t a, but the fact that your kid started the bottle breaking and you don't take any responsibility for it- not for leaving him unsupervised in the parking lot, not for raising a child that thinks it's ok to start smashing bottles, not for the fact that *your* child, not someone else's or the school, created a dangerous situation for his fellow classmates- makes yta. Grow up dude. Care about your kid just as much as you claim to care about your causes.", "If the school was making sure kids weren't being exposed to dangerous ideas, they'd be removing yours from you.\n\nParticularly for you being what appears to be a lazy conservative trying to get a rise with some very base lines", "OP you sound like one of those crunchy parents. get a clue. doesn't matter what caused your kid to start their dangerous behaviour but the behaviour at the party is the problem at hand. stop making it someone elses fault or problem. Your kid was putting everyone in danger, own up to it.", "How was the water you brought packaged?", "Unfortunately, stereotypes exist for a reason but people don't use them wisely and carefully.", "Huh?", "I'd imagine every demogrpahic you could think to draw lines between has had their own share of struggles.\n\nIncluding, the vast majority of all these oppressive men holding you back.\n\nI'm sure personal choice has no bearing whatsoever.", "In Spain, Fanta has 8%  orange juice and only 4,5% sugars but all the added sweeteners and additives make it rather unhealthy, too.", "Well,  fanta has an 8% of oj vs 12% orangina. Again, it's still a soft drink with lots of sugar even in Europe. I've drank both.", "My grandkids have seen tshirts with many questionable things on it and it hasn\u2019t made them go and smash bottles, break into stores.   They have seen MAGA hats. They have even seen some very religious tshirts. And some very non religious ones. Our grandkids learn their values from their family in their home. Not based on a hat they see.", "One of the most famous thieves in my country wrote a book and stated something along the linets with \u201dmy parents thought I got mixed up with  bad company.

If I then tell the police, 'no it was Trevor's idea!' do you think the police will see me as any less involved in the dangerous act I just committed? \n\nParent your kid or deal with the fact that this will only get worse, no matter what school or kids he's around\n\nYTA \n\nAlso your kid has learnt they can lie to you and get away with you leaving the blame on other kids, good job", "\"Very frankly\" A-HA-HA-HA - oh, you're serious? So he  gives you the ultimate get-out excuse, one step short of \"a big boy did it and ran away\", and you believe him just because, what - he's your kid..?? Boy, he knows how to work you, doesn't he... \n\nYTA: for being a prize twit about the glass bottles, for smugly assuming your perfect wee lad didn't need supervising and not even **knowing** what he was up to, and lastly, for believing him that he was just a Little Angel Led Astray - I mean, *really*!... Gullible, much??", "You\u2019re the problem, you seem to think the sun shines out of your kid and they can do no wrong. Even if you truly believed they were influenced by someone else you never taught them to say no? And sorry I have a very hard time believing it wasn\u2019t your kid. If they were the ringleader then they were the one encouraging and LEADING the others.", "So you raised him to have no critical thinking skills, is easily influenced, and can't think for himself.  \n\nWhy do you think that makes you look like a better parent?", "So you're sitting here blaming other kids over and over and refusing to believe your kid could have done anything wrong, and your 7 year old has already figured out to point to the finger when there are consequences. Weird. Never woulda seen that coming.", "So your kid can't think for himself. \n\nDo you get off your high horse to talk to other parents or do you make them scream up at you? Ya know cause you're so perfect... /s", "Nah, crunchy moms would not be giving their kid anything with that much sugar. They water down fruit juice for treats. \n\nThey also would be unlikely to use glass bottles. Glass takes a lot of energy to recycle. They use glassware in the home but not disposable glass bottles.

Ma'am, with all due respect, what the fuck?", "And yet your kid is the one smashing glass. Political ideology does not automatically determine good parenting. Accountability plays a large part in it, which may be why yours is lacking.", "Holy shit, do you hear yourself?  You're on a fast track to you son not being invited to parties.", "Hard no. Absolutely fucking not.\n\nAbout 50% of the population support fascists, but the system they are working in doesn't give them the nuance to express their opinions.\n\nThere is an amount of propoganda going on that is unbelievable trying to polarize the country. Most of it manufactured by external actors.", "I used to teach almost two decades ago and had a lot of parents that made constant excuses for their children. The reality is some kids are good and some kids are bad no matter what the parenting is. BUT some kids require much more discipline and boundaries, and if you add a parent that makes excuses for them, you're going to end up with a pretty big problem down the road. \n\n\nI have always thought that schools should offer parenting classes for free at least once a month. And not just for discipline, but also for homework, grading, helping kids, etc. Just basic ways to be a good parent, because I believe that the vast vast majority of people want to be great parents but don't know how. Some never had good parents, some didn't do well in school, etc. They need help and I feel like educators are in a good position to help. I'm a financial advisor now and it's like my job.

Fucking pedants'", "you mean your kid is getting older and you're too worried about which kind of coke and making excuses  to buy rather than actually parenting ...best of luck as he gets older yta you are exhausting", "What's the bet there was no child called Trevor at the party.", "Yup she is gonna have the next Brock Turner on her hands.", "Nobody has twisted what you've said. You said that you did not see your kid standing on the other side of the street throwing bottles at other kids.", "That's not twisting what you're saying. If you saw a child not your own throwing glass bottles at others you'd say the same fucking thing. Your kid and you clearly need therapy.", "You're the one that said it, lol. \n\n> was throwing them from the other way at the other kids\n\nThey asked you to explain this.  \n\nWas your kid throwing glass bottles at other 7 year old children or not?", "Clearly the well paid workers pour the coke into the bottles by hand with glass ladles duh! /s"]}
