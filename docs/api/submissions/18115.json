You think it is metal and plastic free?", "I\u2019m sorry, but seeing a MAGA hat did not instill your child\u2019s urgency to throw glass bottles.", "What should be done about wearing a hat at a public school, exactly? One that doesn't even have an offensive statement", "Lol OP this is not better, you're saying you raised a kid who can't think for himself and is inclined to violence", "You're exactly the type of person that the right uses as an example of the failings of liberalism.\n\nNot everything needs to be a statement, take responsibility and parent your child.", "Woah. So the rest of the kids were breaking bottles and your kid was throwing the bottles at other children? That is concerning violent behavior from a kid that young. Rather than blaming Trevor, maybe you should also look into therapy, maybe family therapy. That sort of acting out doesn't come from just seeing Maga hats.\n\nThe therapist can help you to learn to model good behavior as well.", "MAGA hats, is the dangerous idea.

I just want to know what your definition of a dangerous idea is", "I'm a communist and I have to say that you're delusional if you think your kid is being indoctrinated to smash glass bottles by fascist seven year olds. Kids do dumb shit.", "It absolutely is not.

What the fuck materials does the factory use then lol", "Mexicoke is not the health food you seem to think it is.

I'm super liberal and live in a majority conservative town. On top of that I'm atheist. Nearly every single one of my 4th grader's friends(since kindergarten) are from religious and conservative families. We have never once had anything close to an issue like this.
