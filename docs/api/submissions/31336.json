{"id": 31336, "submission_id": "17zirwq", "title": "AITA for catching my MIL\u2019s lies and bringing them in front of my husband?", "selftext": "My mother-in-law has been consistently lying to us for the past 6 years, especially about jewellery purchases. For instance, she visits my mom's family jeweler, who has been in our family for over 50years, gets items made, and then spins elaborate stories about their origin. She says they were a gift from her brother, or she already had them, or she just revamped an existing piece, avoiding the truth that my father-in-law in fact paid for everything. They also pretend to not be doing too well financially, even asking us to pay for their tickets to visit us, but it\u2019s all too contradictory when she has spent close to 35-40k on these items! \n\nWhere I come from, mother-in-laws must be treated like moms but I\u2019ve found myself distancing myself from her to protect my mental health. However, since year one of marriage, my husband keeps telling me that I don\u2019t treat her like my own mother. She\u2019s never treated me like her own daughter to begin with and I can\u2019t even begin to describe how she does more for her own daughter than for me. My husband believes she treats both of us the same way. But not. \n\nI suspect some these lies are related to our financial struggles, considering the tight year my husband and I have had. We recently bought a house and borrowed little money from my father-in-law, but we later realized we didn't need the entire amount and are already paying it back.\n\nAdding to the stress, I'm expecting a baby next summer, and my sister-in-law is getting married in the spring. My first trimester was a trip from hell because I not only had complications but mother-in-law started fussing about me being unable to make it for SIL\u2019s wedding. I do want to be a part of the wedding, but unfortunately, everyone involved thinks April is the only viable month for them to get married, which is when I\u2019ll be around 34wk+.  Regardless of that, they exclude me from all the planning and decision-making, keeping many details hidden. SIL has a habit of lying too. Very cringe. Very unnecessary. \n\nHaving been hurt by lies in the past, I'm struggling to make my husband understand the profound impact this has on me. He suggests looking the other way or better, just assume there must be a good reason for all her lies. He tells me I should see their intention and not the lie, but exactly, I don\u2019t get their intention. Today,  he also verbally abused me and it left me feeling broken and hurt. \n\nI truly can\u2019t fathom the reason for her constant lying and I can\u2019t help but telling my husband about it too. AITA?\n\nEdited to clarify: he verbally abused me\n\nEdit: Thanks for all your inputs. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m in the  pack up and leave mindset, not yet. I\u2019ve set up some time with the husband to go over this calmly. And hope I can set some boundaries without him getting worked up or defensive about his family. Will update.

Pregnancy can be tough but we are passed the days of confinement.\n\nI\u2019m confused by the throwaway comment about your husband abusing you. That would usually be the main subject in a thread. Does this happen often and is it a pattern within your relationship? Did you fear him? Or did he just get angry because you are obsessing over his family?

From what you're writing I get the idea that you feel left out of your in-law family, they don't treat you nicely and make your life harder. But you cannot get away from them due to cultural expectations, and your husband is making the situation worse because he is taking his mother's side instead of yours.\n\nI think that as the first step you have to accept that your husband will not take your side in this conflict, you have tried and he's shown you his unwillingness, so you will only fight harder if you try again. This is a hard truth, because the right thing would be that the husband stands by his wife, but you will not get this from him.\n\nAfter this acceptance you  have 2 options:\n\n1. Arrange yourself with this situation, look the other way with your in-laws, keep the peace and don't argue with them. Try to avoid them as much as possible, but be friendly with them when you meet. This will keep the peace with your husband, but you have do decide if you can live with being the doormat for your in-laws. This option requires a lot of holding back from your end while the other parties get their way. On the plus side nothing much changes and everyone around you is happy.\n\n2. Stand up to your husband and make the conditions clear how you want to be treated and that it is your well-being that is the no. 1 priority at your household. Tell him that, as the mother of his future child, you will not accept being treated with disrespect, this includes by himself and his family. Lay out how you like your pregnancy to go and how you want to be treated moving forward. He has to accept that he is married now and this changes his duties and the family dynamics he has gotten used to.\n\nDepending on his reaction to this you will then see if he is willing to treat you as you deserve or not. If not, you still have option no 1 available, now with the added fact that your husband will respect you even less because he knows he can disrespect you and get away from it.
