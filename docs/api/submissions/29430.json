So I just dropped the idea and never mentioned my feelings again. Two weeks ago, she was sick. I visited her twice that week, once with miso soup and the second time with a new book since she was bummed out about not being able to go to the bookstore. Kept her company and helped replace the cool, wet cloth thingy on her forehead to lower her fever, but that's it. Nothing romantic.\n\nLast week, she and her boyfriend broke up. All I know about it is that it was a nasty argument. She came to me, asking me out. I told her I had already moved on and am seeing someone else. My friend got upset, asking me why I took care of her when she was sick if I had moved on. I told her I did it since we're friends and that it's not my fault she interpreted it as me still being interested. She said that I should have known it would give her the wrong idea that I'd be waiting for her in case she gets out of her relationship with her now ex.", "created_utc": 1697969917, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17dq52u/aita_for_telling_my_friend_its_not_my_fault_she/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Now I get she could interprete your behavior, which was nice!! as you still likeing her, however you don't like her romanticaly anymore and she should just deal with it and by any means, should not blame you. You were just a very good friend", "NTA.  You are a better person than her.  She believes that the only reason to buy a sick friend soup and buy them a book in the same week not only means you are romantically interested in them (weird), but is also an unspoken communication that you will put your romantic life on hold for them indefinitely (really weird) so that once her situation changes, and she is now ready to take you off whatever shelf she thinks she\u2019s storing you on, you should feel bad for being a better friend than she would ever be, because the only way she would ever do what you did is if she had a hidden romantic agenda, and would never do such a kind thing for a regular friend.", "NtA\n\n\"wtf stand-in stan!? why u no stand-in!!!??\" \n\ntell her it's her turn to wait", "NTA.\n\nBut, I understand why she would misinterpret it. She should have asked since you were friends first prior to you confessing your feelings before.", "nta she was keeping u in a friendzone and as a backup\n\nbet 1 reason she broke up is u took better care of her than her bf", "You are not her back up plan. why would you hang around, waiting for her after you were rejected?", "NTA but her frustration and maybe embarrassment of being rejected is understandable. I would just give her little communication and let her cool off", " NAH\n\nHonestly though, did you never mention the fact you were going on a date while you were spending all that time with her? It just seems weird to spend a lot of time with someone and not mention you\u2019re interested in dating somebody", "NTA. She's got a mouth, she needs to learn to ask and clarify if she's making big decisions off of assumptions.", "NAh", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
