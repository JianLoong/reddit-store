The second part might very well be true but that doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing. She probably hadn't been dating her now-Ex for long or OP as her friend would probably have known about him.

It\u2019s just an unfortunate case of bad timing.  \n\nMy interpretation is that she realized what a great guy you were when she was sick\u2014you were loyal and stood by her.  Whereas her boyfriend obviously didn\u2019t, or else she wouldn\u2019t have needed you.  So now she realizes that she made a major mistake  when she turned you down.  She wasn\u2019t making a value statement about you when she said no to a date\u2014she was simply trying to be a good girlfriend and not cheat on the guy she was already with.  Would have wanted her if she turned out to be a cheater?  If the answer is no, then she was damned either way.\n\nWhen she got sick, it put both you and the boyfriend to a reliability and loyalty test.  You won.  In fact, it sounds like he was a complete no-show that just wanted to use her for sex.  That is probably what the big fight was about.  She probably broke up with him because of it.  \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate you moved on because now she knows you are a keeper.  Sadly, this sort of thing happens all the time.  No one is an asshole in this situation\u2014except maybe the ex-boyfriend.  It\u2019s just a case of bad timing and miscommunication.", "NTA, I wish more men took a rejection of romance in this way.

Is it ego? Narcissism? I don't get it.", "NTA.  You were being a good friend.  You asked her out, she said no.  You went back to being friends.  She thought you'd wait around for her, that you'd be her backup plan.  Nope.", "NTA. Sounds like you dodged a bullet", "Nta. She realized that her own bf wasn't taking care of her like you were - a guy she thought had feelings for her - she broke up with her guy and she thought you'd be there waiting for her - she's probably embarrassed and sometimes people lash out when they feel feelings because we weren't taught how to manage them and turn them into clear communication. If you've moved on that's completely fine. But I don't think the friendship is recoverable. She has feelings for you now and it's just a toxic mess. Also, she's waving a few red flags. It's probably best to put some distance between the two of you. At the very least, so that you show your new partner some respect. I'd not have a woman in my home that my partner had feelings for, I'd definitely not be with someone that spent time with a friend they had feelings for. Not even considering that she now has feelings for you. It's not respectful or appropriate", "NTA you were just being a good friend\n\nI do wonder tho, did you still had contact with her in those 2 months?", "NTA\n\nIt absolutely amazes me at the audacity of some people (male and female), who feel that a person, who once had feelings for them, shouldn't move on just because said person doesn't want to date them right then. They expect a person to wait on them until they are ready to date. That's not how it works in the real world, maybe in a drama, but not in reality.", "Yikes she's using you as rebound material. Nobody wants to be someone's second choice as a partner. You're an awesome friend and I'm really sorry she used you as a potential second choice partner like this. Genuine friends don't think that bringing soup and books is a sign of romantic interest. What you did is literally just what friends do for each other. I would not date this woman, she's shown two warning signs (you being second choice/rebound material in her eyes and also her expecting you to be single, waiting on her to break up). Glad her crazier side has shown now and that you didn't jump in the moment she broke up with her now ex. Big yikes moment, bullet dodged.", "I'm not sure why people keep saying she is using you as a rebound or keeping you on the hook. She had a boyfriend at the time you confessed your feelings, which you didn't know about. What was she supposed to do, break up with him then? Obviously things weren't going well though if you were the one showing up for her and he wasn't. And perhaps she realized at that time you were a decent person and decided to ask you out. I do however, find it slightly hard to believe, that at the time you were taking care of her, you suddenly had zero feelings for her after just a couple weeks. Idk, seems like you have your guard up or something. Most men don't go out of their way to nurture a women back to health without some kind of interest/ feeling. Just my humble opinion.", "NAH. Timing wasn't on your side right now in a romantic way. Maybe that will change at some point, maybe not. It's okay that she's disappointed, just like it's okay that you're more interested in someone else now. She saw you in a different light and went for it. Like you did a few months ago. There's no foul here. Hopefully, you guys laugh off the embarrassment and stay good friends.", "NTA\n\nBut be careful with this \u201cfriendship\u201d. Real friendships involve no romantic interest on either side, ever.", "NTA to either of you. \n\nI did something similar when I was younger I had asked a friend and coworker out on a date. She had told me no. We have remained friends and I still treat her as a friend the same way before I asked her on a date. I think she was giving me the side eye for a few weeks to see how I was dealing, but realized I was just acting like myself. \n\nI don't think your friend realized you had moved on. With romantic and friendship occasionally blurring lines. Everyone has an ego and a sense of self importance. So she probably didn't even think you had moved on. She wants to feel like she is worth something and is a catch. Just like everyone else does. \n\n\nMy personal opinion is you two should sit down and talk it out to prevent further confusion if you want to remain friends.", "NTA. \n\nHelping someone when they're sick is not necessarily something a bf would do, but something any friend or family would do.", "NTA.   She is hurt from her relationship and acting out on it.  Let her chill out and you guys will be friends like nothing happened.", "Nta, willing to bet she left her boyfriend because you actually treated her better as a friend than he did as a boyfriend and thought you were still interested.", "NTA - Sounds like you were her backup plan. Might have dodged a bullet there, considering how quickly she is ready to move on from her ex. Red flags everywhere on this one.", "You sound like a really great friend. Hope she doesn't fuck this up with her arrogant attitude", "NTA,imagine being a decent person is being misunderstood as having romantic interest", "Nah she's using you as a rebound", "NTA, tbh I would be more offended as a girl that my \u2018friend\u2019 was only being nice to me to get into my pants. You were a sincere friend. Your feelings moved on and she shouldn\u2019t be turning you into a rebound anyway.", "Your lucky sounds like a rebound thing or maybe a thing to throw in the guys face, dodged a bullet buddy!", "NTA. if she was hoping you'd wait for her in case she broke up with her partner, she doesn't sound very committed to me. would you really want to date someone like that anyway?", "Oh, so she thought you were going to be her stand by man. The guy she can use to make herself feel better until a new potential boyfriend comes along and then she could just place you on the back burner again to wait. Definitely NTA.", "NTA.\n\nThat's just weird on her end: why would she immediately ask you out after breaking up. That just screams rebound.", "NTA\n\nDamn, so no man should do a nice thing for her unless they wanna get in her pants?!\n\nHer logic is skewed\n\nStay awy from crazy! Imagine you having a relationship with her, then you help out another female friend! Drama!!", "So she had you in the friendzone just in case and got upset that you moved on?", "NTA.  So how does it feel to be the default option?   She must not have been too serious about him if she came looking for you so quickly", "NTA .. BUT... you know you still care about her, hence showing up. Be honest.  HOWEVER, you can't be her Rebound relationship. THAT will kill your soul.", "I feel like theres a ton of missing information. Why would she just assume all that if there was nothing on your end on that topic", "NTA. What a silly girl to just assume.", "NTA- but she broke up with him for you. Not your fault, but she is just mad because now she doesn't have anyone. I bet she gets back with her ex.", "NTA If it is something you would have done before you declared interest, then you should be able to continue. Yes, even past behavior might be reinterpreted in light of your declaration, but your behavior was in line with what was acceptable in the past and her assumption was pretty, well, presumptuous.", "NTA\n\nYou were just being a good friend. You asked her out a while ago, she said no, and you accepted it and moved on. \n\nShe's a bit full of herself, to think you'd be pining on the sidelines waiting for her to break up.", ">She said that I should have known it would give her the wrong idea that I'd be waiting for her in case she gets out of her relationship with her now ex.\n\nI'm sorry, but is she...without using the word, saying she expected you to hover in the friendzone for her as a backup? Because that's what this sounds like exactly. She's upset you moved on, that you didn't pine forever, because you realized that she was offlimits when you didn't know she'd been dating someone, and now she's upset that life didn't wait for her...\n\nYeah, NTA.\n\nYou helped her as a friend, and she sexualized it. That's on her.", "NTA. She fafo. Good on you for being a good friend, accepting no for an answer and having the self worth to accept a rejection and move on. Because she wants to play mind games is not on you, I hope your current relationship is exactly what you\u2019re looking for and your current partner shows you the same level of commitment.", "Nta she sees you as a second option.

NTA but she is in need of some character repair. Bullet dodged!", "N.T.A! You're a good man. You value your friendship with her despite being rejected. You're not one of the \"nice guys,\" and that she responded to you like this is a huge red flag. First, asking you out right after a breakup, then taking your true friendship and goodness and shitting on it? No, she's not a keeper, not even for a friend. Even women can be a \"nice guy.\" I'm glad she rejected you so you didn't fall into her trap. Women like her break good men.\n\nOnce again, NTA. You're a good man, and your woman is very lucky to have you.", "The fact that she'd assume he'd be waiting for her is so weird.

Unfortunately, there is so much hostility between the sexes these days that it is very easy to fall into negative generalizations about the opposite sex.  Sadly, I think many of the problems that we encounter, when dating, really do boil down to timing and miscommunication, combined with one or both parties being way too reactionary.  Both men and women are guilty of it.  \n\nThere is merit in the idea that you should take a deep breath, and count slowly to ten before saying anything\u2014AND THEN your next words should probably be something like, \u201cI am not sure I understand\u2026did you really mean to say\u2026\u201d or, \u201cHelp me understand.

Anyone else would be booted out in short order, lol.", "Bro, your parents treating you bad while you're sick doesn't make it some kind of crazy intimate gesture to be kind.", "Tbi's suck, as does the massive and frequent thought train derailments Hope you heal quickly!", "Lost Dog can\u2019t read \ud83d\udc80", "And if someone offered that it would feel very intimate and not just friendly, as its a form of care that is more caring then your parents were, right? I know, if someone offered that kind of care to me, and I felt close enough to them to accept, I would still be incredibly thankful and happy and it would not feel like \"friends do that\" but like \"they walked every extra mile there is and did so much just for me, they must care alot about me, how can I ever express my gratitude and how much it means to me\". Just the \"checking in and bringing soup\" would make me feel this way. As they totally went out of their way to do that. And then, on top, buying a book, spending time at my bed, caring physically, visiting twice?", "But it can make it feel like it is. Your perception of kindness can be warped, in a way that a bit feels like much and much feels intimate and very intense.", "I agree. I think doing it as just a friend is normal, but it also makes sense that it would feel like more for many people. But that is why we can use words, to explain misunderstandings, which OP did and she should have accepted it. She was probably ashamed and that is why she acted out.\n\nOn the other hand I feel it is quite odd you would go that far for a friend that you didnt know they were in a relationship when you asked them out. Like the trust lvls don't seem to match up.\n\nIf this is real, I think it is better that they are not together.", "But how do we know any of this about the girl in op\u2019s comment\nYour argument and replies are built off assumptions", "I can say from experience and I wasnt talking about OP specifically, just stating that it is, in fact, very possible to see these caring acts as much more than platonic. Not everyone will see what he did as friendly and people can see that as very loving and caring. Depending on personal experience ofc. But such acts can be seen intimately and can be meant intimately so there could have been confusion on the girls part. She did not act good and both failed to communicate and we miss a bit stuff and OP is fully in his right to decline, but she could have taken his caring as very intimately."]}
