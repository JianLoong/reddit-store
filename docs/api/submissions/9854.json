My husband \u201cHowie\u201d (36m) and I are very excited for this child, especially after having an early miscarriage back in September.  \n \n\nOne of my biggest fears is weight gain. I\u2019m already not small but not huge, either. I\u2019m smaller than the average sized American woman but could lose about ten to twenty pounds to give you an idea. I was already concerned about my weight before I got pregnant, so now the idea of losing my pre-pregnancy weight on top of whatever I gain now is stressful.  \n\n\nHowie wants to lose weight, too. We decided to pick an outfit we\u2019d like to try to fit in again after the baby arrives to meet our weight goal. Howie chose the outfit from the day we met and I chose my wedding dress from our April 2022 wedding.  \n \n\nMy friend \u201cMay\u201d (34f) is getting married to her fianc\u00e9 \u201cJoe\u201d (37m) in September of this year. I\u2019ve gone with her dress shopping a couple of times but she hasn\u2019t been able to find one that she likes. I discovered over the weekend that the dress she actually wanted was mine, and she was looking for one similar but couldn\u2019t find it. May then asked me if she could borrow mine.  \n \n\nI said don\u2019t want my dress altered for any reason because it\u2019s mine, and I made a lot of customizations to it. It truly is my dress, and no one has one like it.  But May told me she\u2019s in a bind because there\u2019s not much time to order a dress and have it altered in the time for her wedding. I felt bad but told her no. I don\u2019t want anyone wearing it, period.  \n \n\nMay kept pressing about it, and I also told her it wasn\u2019t just because it\u2019s mine but because of the weight loss idea my husband and I had. May is two wedding dress sizes larger than me. I also have an hourglass figure where May is more shaped like an apple. No insults, but it\u2019s just how she looks. Plus, my dress still fits me. I\u2019m just anticipating it won\u2019t after giving birth, and I want to make that my weight loss outfit. If I let her borrow it, it would have to be altered so much that it wouldn\u2019t be mine anymore.  \n \n\nMay told me I had an entire wardrobe to choose from and no one fits their dress after a few years, anyway. She also said that baby weight usually doesn\u2019t go away (she has 2 kids), and that I should be thinking about her wedding.  I still said no. But a few minutes ago, I got a text from Howie asking me if I agreed to give her my dress. I said no, and Howie sent me a screenshot from Joe saying Howie can bring my dress over when he gets off work and thanked me for being so generous. So it sounds to me like May told Joe I agreed when I didn\u2019t. Now Joe is angry because he thinks I changed my mind.  \n \n\nHowie told him I never agreed. Now May is texting me, asking why I\u2019m so attached to a dress and saying I\u2019m not being a good friend because I\u2019m more interested in a material item than her happiness. But I feel like this is self-explanatory? It\u2019s my dress. The end.

It\u2019s your dress, you are not obligated to share it with anyone.

The weight-loss or being able to fit after having the baby is irrelevant. It's your freaking wedding dress.\n\nHer lying to her fiance about it in this manner would make me cut her off.

You have decided what you want to do with it and she needs to get over it.", "NTA\n\nIt is your dress. End of the discussion. \n\nShe is getting married in September, IDK where you guys live, but where I live, it doesn't take 6.5 months to order a dress and get it fitted according to her needs. Also, the weight loss dress reason aside, you don't owe her YOUR dress. Even if it wasn't your wedding dress, you still don't owe her your fucking clothes. What is she on about?\n\nShe lied to her husband that you had agreed, which ended up with him messaging your husband to bring the dress around when he was free. She went behind your back OP. You can ask her to cut her BS right then and there. She concocted this plan thinking your husband would not double check with you, and she would get the dress without you even knowing and by the time you would come to know, it would have been too late. I don't think you should even go to her wedding.", "NTA. It is your dress and that is the end of it. It makes it even worse that she lied to her fiance saying you said yes to giving the dress.

Do not go to this crazy person's wedding!\n\n\"because I\u2019m more interested in a material item than her happiness.\"\n\nBullshit.  She's more interested in her own happiness than yours.  That's not how a friend should treat a friend.  Tell her to pound sand and when you get the invite, mark yourself down as \"Not Attending\".  Don't send a gift, but a nice card is appropriate.", "NTA. Your possessions are yours to do with as you wish. And speaking as a person who recently got married and wore a wedding dress to do so, the idea that February is too late to order a dress and have it altered for a September wedding is ridiculous.", "One of those lessons we learn when entering adulthood is that just because something isn't important to you, doesn't mean it isn't very important to someone else. You not wanting your wedding dress altered, you wanting to fit into it after the baby is born, those things aren't important to May. So, either she doesn't give a damn about your property,sentimentalities or wants, or she just hasn't yet reached adulthood intellectually or emotionally.  NTA but May sure is.", "NTA OP, you are completely right that this is self-explanatory but your \"friend\" May is so self-absorbed and selfish that she can't listen to reason or accept NO for an answer. Honestly, this is a deal-breaker as far as the future of this friendship goes because May had already gone to extraordinary lengths to try and manipulate you into giving her what she wants. First, May went dress shopping a few times with you to find her \"dream dress\" when in actuality it was your dress that she wanted. Now that the wedding is so close she doesn't have time to find any other dress and her only option is your dress with \"just enough time left to get it properly altered for her.\" Second, she tried to dismiss every single one of your reasons that you gave her as to why you weren't going to lend her the dress thereby completely disrespecting and dismissing your feelings on the matter. Lastly, when it was clear and obvious that you weren't going to cave to May she got her fiance Joe and your husband Howie involved by blatantly lying to Joe saying you agreed to her insane proposal. Thank goodness your husband has a good head on his shoulders and double checked with you before doing anything after receiving that text from Joe!\n\nDon't pay anymore attention to your former friend May's attempts to gaslight you into doing what she wants OP. She's an entitled, selfish individual who expects you to give her whatever she wants, whenever she wants it. That's not someone you need in your life as a friend OP.", "NTA and doesn\u2019t matter the reason, your wedding dress is your wedding dress. It is not your fault if she has failed to get a dress by now, that was on her. She asked, you said no - end of story.", "NTA, this is your dress, you can decide what to do with it. If you don't want someone wearing your clothes then you can clearly say so, which you did. Your friend, and maybe her fianc\u00e9 (if he was told to manipulate), are 100% the AH for lying and going behind your back. Big props to your husband for making sure they were actually doing what you wanted.", "Nta she literally tried to STEAL your dress. She\u2019s not your friend.  She\u2019s a manipulative bridezilla who is willing to destroy your property to save a few bucks on a dress.", "NTA May is the crazy one here, you\u2019ve clearly said no and never once even wavered. She seems to think she can pressure, manipulate and sand bag you into giving it to her. Stand firm but you\u2019ll likely not be able to continue friendships with her.", "NTA. \n\nGroup chat to Joe, Howie, and May: Just to clear up any confusion, although I think I was pretty clear with May when she asked, but no, I am not lending my wedding dress to May. As I told her, the dress is special to me, and I don't want it altered. I don't appreciate that May tried to get the dress anyway and Joe, I want to be very clear with you that I said no when May asked, so not sure why she would tell you to text Howie to get the dress. I am now a bit upset as this feels like she went behind my back to STEAL my dress. \n\nThere, that's done. Now you deal with the fallout how you like. First, that is your wedding dress and you don't owe it to anybody, just like you don't need to let anyone borrow anything you own. Sure, it's nice to lend out an item when someone needs it (like a lawnmower or vacuum) but the idea with being nice and lending something is that it comes back the same way, just a little bit more used. That's not what will happen with your dress, as no matter if she is bigger or smaller, she isn't the same shape as you. So don't feel bad, as May has a world of dress to choose from. As a plus size girl myself, I can get a very cute tea length or floor length dress online that will be delivered in a week. Sure, it isn't the most grand, but that's what last minute gets you. If she has more time, loads more choices await. But why bother when you can try and steal a free dress from your friend?\n\nAnd that's the fallout. May would have stolen your dress from you and ruined it. That's not a friend. You and Howie need to realize the extend that May has just gone to, and what would have happened if Howie- understandably- had just handed over the dress. May cannot be trusted, and you don't need to try and make her or Joe feel better, you just need to send that text and see if May comes clean and apologizes, or doubles down on trying to make you feel bad.", "NTA, it\u2019s your wedding dress why wouldn\u2019t you be attached to it. If she liked it that much she could have just had one custom made. Also lying to try to get is a just such a bad move. I\u2019d be careful.", "NTA. No is a complete sentence. Your dress hold memories, its an item of significance to you. If may can't appreciate that, shes not a true friend. Might be time to drop the rope with her.", "NTA and if she has a key to your house consider changing the locks or taking your dress to a TRUSTED family member for safe keeping. I\u2019ve read enough stories like this where things can escalate when you think it\u2019s over! Maybe cameras too.", "NTA.\n\nShe asked. You said no. That's it. End of story. The reason for why you said no doesn't matter. No is a complete sentence all on its own. Her continued badgering and guilting you just means that she doesn't respect you or the boundary you have set. I suggest that you send a final text to both Joe and May:\n\nWhile I am very sorry that you are struggling to find a dress you like, I have made it very clear that you cannot use my dress. My answer has been no from the beginning; at no point did I say you could use it. I don't know why you would lie to Joe and tell him I had agreed when I did not. Your continued badgering and guilt-tripping to get me to give in has shown me that you don't respect me or my boundaries. If you cannot accept my answer, then I will have to distance myself for the near future.\n\nThen, if they continue to badger you about it, block both of their numbers.\n\nIt sucks that this may end up being the thing that ends a friendship, but as someone who lost a friend of almost 10 years over an equally crazy wedding issue, I know how frustrating it can be. I would be willing to bet that there have been other times when May has had to have things her way in the past and either it hadn't bumped against one of your boundaries or, if it did, you didn't stand your ground on it. Noe that she's not getting her way, she's showing her true self and how much you actually mean to her.", "Nta. A wedding dress is a very personal item that is full of memories for the wearer. It is understandable that you don't want it altered or damaged. Your 'friend' is not really a friend since she is trying to bully you into giving it to her,  and since she also tried to pull a fast one and take it without your permission after you clearly said no by trying to get it through her husband lying to your husband. If a friend did this to me,  they would no longer be a friend.", "NTA\n\nMay should try 2nd hand clothing stores.  It's surprising how many wedding dresses get donated to places like those and they are really inexpensive.", "Nta, it's really weird why she's so obsessed with yours. And the comment about not having time to alter makes me think she just wants a freebie as she'd have looked earlier otherwise", "NTA. You get to decide what to do with your own stuff, and I hope you can set your friends straight on what actually happened.", "NTA.\n\nmay is insanely entitled holy shit", "NTA. May is not your friend. She just showed you that your dress means more to her than your friendship since she was literally lying to get her hands on it without your knowledge.\n\nMay can go suck eggs!", "NTA, the whole thing is gross. You said no, end of. Altho if she wants to keep pushing, here is a short list of things to throw at her that isn't \"go beg somewhere else,\";\n\n1) May has a number of stores to choose from, shes free to pick one to get her dress from.\n\n2) The baby weight thing is a myth, everyone knows with a proper diet and excersize that isn't hysterical crying from hormones and sleep deprivation, will shift that weight eventually.\n\n3) Her wedding day isn't your problem. Her wedding day isnt Christmas, isnt new year and it isnt the royal jubilee. It's nice shes getting married thats great for her, but it isnt your problem she didnt plan her dress??? its almost like she always expected to beg it off of you and didnt need to plan that part?\n\n4) Why is she so attached to your dress and not being a good friend and being more interested in a material item than your happiness? \n\nIt is your dress, the end. If Joe wants to die on this hill then meet him at dawn armed with the fact that his Not-Yet-Mrs is totally fine with lying to him and manipulating him to get what she wants. And if he doesnt back down, tell him youll give the dress to his next wife.\n\nI'm so mad for you, you should be googling baby booties and basinettes not dealing with this shite.", "NTA may is acting entitled and being very discouraging by saying that the baby weight doesn't go away, I can confidently say after watching dozens of women in my family have kids that the weight will go if you are determined to make it go (the exceptions being women in my family who had 4+ kids or not enough time in their lives to focus on themselves)", "NTA- not sure what delusional level May is residing in, but wedding dresses are typically cherished by brides after their weddings. This is not a regular outfit.", "NTA I think it's more May is hellbent on getting a free dress. She can look at Etsy, Ebay, Goodwil has a website, etc.. If you'd already been married I'd say consider it, but now? No.", "NTA. Ask May why she's so attached to a dress (that's not even hers!) and why she's not being a good friend by being more interested in a material item than your happiness.", "NTA.\n\nA good friend would stop trying to get a dress after you\u2019ve already told them no.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with you not wanting to get rid of your dress. Perhaps if you have a daughter, maybe you want her to have your dress, or it\u2019s got such sentimental value to you.\n\nThis is a sign, establish some boundaries or it may be time to walk away from the friendship.\n\nI hope the weight loss journey goes fantastic for you, and best of luck to you and your baby", "NTA even a little bit. She is being incredibly pushy about completely redoing your wedding dress (which I'm sure you spent a good chunk of change on). First, it's your property, no one is entitled to it. Two, it's a wedding dress, that's not just another dress from just another day. It has memories and experiences attached to it. Three, you are using it as your weight loss motivation, so you still want to use it in the exact size and state it is in now. Personally, I would think how close I stayed to her due to her pushy and manipulative behavior.", "NTA \n\nShe can buy off the rack, her lack of planning isn\u2019t your problem", "NTA, your friend needs to not be your friend anymore. My goodness.", "NTA.  She insisted and insisted and then lied to her fianc\u00e9 to trick your husband into stealing it.\n\nThis woman is not your friend.", "NTA. How on earth is she going to alter the dress so as to make it *larger*? If it fit her, I personally would lend it, but I understand why someone would not want to. But even asking to borrow someone else\u2019s wedding dress is shockingly pushy. Wanting to alter it, and then continuing to push, is beyond the pale. Is she from another planet? Was she raised on a commune? WTF?", "I wouldn't lend the dress out. It is a keepsake; she is being way too pushy.  You may want to save it for your daughter. How could a friend put this kind of pressure on you? She won't take no for an answer. That is very disrespectful. \n\nYou are actually a victim of harassment at this point. She is totally disrespecting you and your boundaries. She thinks she is entitled to your dress, no one is entitled to your property. Has no one ever told her no before. This is insane.\n\nYou may want to renew your vows someday and want to wear your dress. It isn't any business of hers why you don't want her to alter your dress and wear it. She could ruin the dress and it would be useless to you after.\n\nI suspect you are being manipulated and bullied at this point. If you don't want to sell her the dress(not borrow) then just say no, and this is final. I would not be friends with these people anymore if they can't respect your decision. Who needs friends like these?", "NTA: You're about to lose a friend, but that's ok. This isn't a good friend. This is a \"friend\" who is actively trying to manipulate the fuck out of everyone because she wants a dress for free that she feels entitled to.", "NTA. Even if you were the same size you wouldn\u2019t be under any obligation to lend her your dress. The fact that it would need alterations to fit her makes it even worse.

I am also pregnant and plan to have little photo sessions in my wedding dress after giving birth to my second child to have motivation to loose the baby weight (which is totally possible, I lost pretty much all the weight I gained with the first one, my sister weights way less than before children due the diet). I would never lend the dress to anybody since I know how easy is to damage it. If she likes yours she can pay seamstress to make similar one for her.
