It is something they will know soon enough, so... It just came up right? You don't owe your STBXW nothing anymore.", "NTA, they asked and you answered honestly. If this was a more amicable split, then I would say you should have talked about when and how to break it to the family. In this scenario, she\u2019s getting to lie in the bed she made.", "NTA but why tf would you stay with her after she already cheated 4 times", "NTA. They thought the family would never know?\u2019 How dumb", "NTA. \n\nHow were you supposed to know that she hadn't told her family? That's a her problem, not a you problem.", "NTA. -  was it supposed to be a secret until the decree was signed?  Seems like life will much less stressful for you going forward.  Good luck", "NTA. You deserve at least this announcement after what she\u2019s done to you", "NTA, you don't owe your cheating acts and a secrecy. In fact you shouldn't keep secrets for your cheating ex, cuz that's the rope your cheater will hang you on.\n\nIt's right to tell them that you're getting divorced, and you're doing so because she's now cheated on you for the fifth time and is leaving. You're not the one causing this, and it's already been set in motion", "NTA, she had almost two months to deliver the news however she wanted. How we\u2019re you supposed to know she hadn\u2019t told anyone. And either way, it\u2019s been long enough. They\u2019ll find out eventually when you don\u2019t live in that house together anymore.", "NTA.  Good work", "Nope, NTA.", "Hard NTA.", "Whats a stbx?", "NTA.    Not your role to lie for the ex who cheated on you.", "NTA. Fuck cheaters and their unfailing need to give fictionalized accounts of why the relationship failed instead of owning up to their infidelity.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I hope you had DNA tests done on the kids", "I believe she's upset about the truth being told vs her version.", "I think she's more upset due to the fact I'm giving the truth. Her version would exclude why the divorce came about.", "Man first time was struggles living at her moms when I left the army. The others I just loved her and thought it would be better.

Also, I hope you told them why you were getting the divorce.", "NTA. She owed you fidelity", "Well no one told your ex to end the marriage to go after her ex bf.
