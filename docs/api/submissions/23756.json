Sure, many people / groups can go to strips clubs, drink, have fun and not end up arrested, divorcing, breaking up and dropping out of the wedding; this group obviously were not able to do so, and I find it very difficult to believe this wasn't evident beforehand. Ostensibly they've all partied together before and knew what chaos could ensue. That you snorted at their naivete doesn't make you the AH.\n\nYour mother telling you to apologize because your sister is having to replace most of her wedding party shows me just exactly where you sister gets it from.", "NTA.

While it may be understandable that you were frustrated by the outcome of the joint bachelor/bachelorette party, your response to your sister was judgmental and lacked empathy.

End up arrested and/or broken up with\"? Really? Are you 15?\n\nalso, lol @ \"exotic dancers\"\n\nalso, (3) thinking than being right is more important than respecting someone else's feelings.\n\notherwise, pretty funny.

The sister's stress in needing to replace them is overshadowing the actual chaos of the breakups/divorce/arrest.  \n\n100% this outcome would have been predictable based on knowing the wedding party beforehand.  Also, c'mon, it's kind of an epic outcome.  I'd also guffaw a bit.", "OP is being very vague about what actually went down, but the more they post the more it seems like the strip club setting was almost irrelevant.

My cousin is a talented singer. She is single and was supposed to sing a song during the ceremony. However she hooked up with the maid of honor. Whom nobody knew had that in her.

Obviously if she got drugs for people she knows struggle with addiction, or brought a very conservative couple to a strip club without telling them issues are inevitable, but from the post it sounds like the party went absolutely off the rails, sister is distraught (possibly not about finding new bridal party members, but at having her party end in actual carnage) and OP was blatantly scoffing about it. Obviously that's not going to lead to a great reaction", "Agreed! The post started with judgement on join strip clubs. It\u2019s common for many people (I personally didn\u2019t but know many who did). Sister seems to have shitty friends, but that\u2019s not her fault as others can control themselves and she is not responsible for them.

I'm also really curious as to what when on, because it was wide spread enough 3 couples broke up, 1 is pending divorce and a bunch others have dropped out. That's not just a one person issue, that's at least 4 friends that have been effected, how do you supposedly not know at least 4 of your friends are shitty people? Ultimately though if you don't know how friends behave in public, let alone drunk and drugged, you just wouldn't tempt fate. \n\nYou also don't just suddenly spring drugs (especially if they're hard drugs like coke which OP implies in a comment) on people who you don't know if they're interested or haven't done it before. Maybe it's just my experience, but I've never met anyone that was mentally sound or making healthy decisions that did coke. Nor have I met anyone who does coke that isn't insufferable to be around. \n\nThat is, unless you're really dumb, then I could see all this happening. In which case, it's still hilarious.", "Strip clubs may be common practice for prewedding parties. In fairness these are usually visited separately though. The joint thing is what has disaster written all over it.", "Oooooooooooo I think OPs derision was amplified by her own long term family dynamics. Mom\u2019s reaction kinda hinted at that.  So I would have to have been there before I could pile on outrage on the OP.
