Like why did everyone breakup exactly", "NTA. The collateral damage from this party shows just how bad of an idea this was. Sure, many people / groups can go to strips clubs, drink, have fun and not end up arrested, divorcing, breaking up and dropping out of the wedding; this group obviously were not able to do so, and I find it very difficult to believe this wasn't evident beforehand. Ostensibly they've all partied together before and knew what chaos could ensue. That you snorted at their naivete doesn't make you the AH.\n\nYour mother telling you to apologize because your sister is having to replace most of her wedding party shows me just exactly where you sister gets it from.", "NTA.

End up arrested and/or broken up with\"? Really? Are you 15?\n\nalso, lol @ \"exotic dancers\"\n\nalso, (3) thinking than being right is more important than respecting someone else's feelings.\n\notherwise, pretty funny.

Empathy costs nothing.", "YTA.

She doesn\u2019t deserve that.\n\nI could put my friends drunk in a strip club with their partners and none of them would break-up I am pretty sure. LOL.

The bride has had a bevy of bridesmaids catering to her for months saying her every idea was genius and drying each tear.

My point is this: I had high hopes,love in my heart and none (zero) of the tools to build or maintain a marriage until after I co-founded\nan impressive divorce.

Knowing that your partner went to a strip club isn't the same as watching them getting handsy during a lapdance.\n\nOn top of that every guest is also facing the expectations of the inviting couple to make it a fun night.

There are a staggering amount of clubs and dancers that are 100% on board with prostitution because it brings in the money, and that's why they are all in that industry. When I worked as a bouncer, I was told by the owner of a bar that hosted strip shows, and the security for the dancers, to turn a blind eye to things that make Caligula blush.

I had a conversation with one of my best friends recently. She was pissed off at a close friend for fighting her over her calling herself a sex worker. She's a stripper and does online stripping content.

She still falls under the umbrella, same as p*rn stars/adult film actors, full service sex workers, other strippers, etc etc.\n\nPeople have a stigma over the word \"sex worker\"  THEY are the ones adding to that stigma by continuing to use \"sex worker\" to only mean full service. ANYONE in the sex industry is considered a \"sex worker\" as long as they are providing any service meant to create sexual tension or sexual acts themselves, such as stripping, exotic dancing, pictures/videos/content, all the way to full service.\n\nAll full service sex workers are sex workers.
