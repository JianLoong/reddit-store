How about the fact that all your time and energy went to Ed, while Carl was shunted off to the side because he was \"the healthy kid\"? I've seen this a million times in here, including in my own family. You don't get what it's like to be the one that the parents don't pay attention to because they're not sick or disabled. \r  \n\r  \nCarl is in no way obligated to give you money for anything. You have no idea why he's resentful and seem to think that just because he's family, he should fork over money. Ed is your responsibility, not your other son's.

Not surprised he's going NC with you over this.", ">He and Carl weren't close growing up for some reason.\n\nI am definitely getting those \"missing missing reason\" vibes.\n\nLet me guess. You were overwhelmed with a disabled child. You threw all of your energy and care into your special needs child, neglected your other child entirely, and expected your other child to sacrifice his entire life to care for his disabled brother, thus forcing him to lose his identity and depriving him of your time and attention? Yeah, we get this story here a lot.\n\nYour child is not obligated to pay for the surgery of your other child. That is YOUR JOB. Not his. \n\nYou should be happy that one of your children is doing well, got married, and is happy. Not resenting him for that and forcing your personal obligations onto him.\n\n>he's not calling me back.\n\nIf Carl is wise, he is going to go no contact with you permanently. And that would be the right call.\n\nYTA", "OP, this is so obvious it feels like a creative writing exercise. You are hitting every note of a parent who forced their kid to grow up early and act like a third parent to a disabled sibling, whose existence and desires are completely subsumed by their sibling. YTA.\n\nAlso, c'mon dude:\n\n> Carl got married recently and had a destination wedding which cost him lots of money. My wife and I attended and gave our blessings but I briefly mentioned to him how he could've helped out with his brother's surgery instead of having a big wedding like that and he looked at me confused. He thrn got mad and accused me of guilting him for not helping with the surgery. I said I wasn't guilting him, just making an observation. \n\nThis is just *pathetic*. If you're going to beg your own kids for a handout, at least don't treat them like an idiots and own up to what you're clearly implying, instead of pretending you're a moron just making random statements without purpose and they are being unreasonable for interpreting them the way anybody on the planet would.", "\nYTA, and your wife is right.\n\nGosh, it sounds like a lifetime of you probably focusing on Ed and expecting Carl to make up the difference. Couldn\u2019t you at least let Carl enjoy his own wedding? And are you sure you don\u2019t know why the boys didn\u2019t get along growing up?", "INFO : Did Carl pay for you and your wife to attend the destination wedding or did you *chose* to pay your way instead of saving the money toward your other son\u2019s surgery?", ">He and Carl weren\u2019t close growing up for some reason. \n\nProbably because you didn\u2019t give Carl enough attention as a kid. Or now. You probably gave all the attention to Ed, because he\u2019s disabled. \n\nThis is not uncommon. It\u2019s not uncommon for the other child to feel abandoned. As they often are, to a degree. \n\n>I asked if he could help paying for his brother\u2019s surgery but he refused. \n\nOf course he did. He is not the one who has a disabled child. You are. Ed is the brother. Not the parent. \n\n>I told him this was cruel of him \n\nIt\u2019s not. Get over yourself already. \n\n>he reminded me of how much he sacrificed when he was younger for Ed\u2019s sake. \n\nListen to your son.

Never bothered finding out why? It only started being of interest to you once he could pay for his brother so that you wouldn't have to?\n\nYour wife's right. Anyone making a point about \"making just a simple observation\" like that is almost guaranteed to be a major asshole.\n\nCarl gets to live his life now; he probably had to swallow the bitter end often enough in the past so stop trying to put him back in the role you forced om him while you raised him.", "\"He and Carl weren't close growing up for some reason.\"\n\nI would guess your next observation is that 'for some reason' Carl wont communicate with you at all.\n\nI do like this bit though: \"I said I wasn't guilting him, just making an observation\".\n\nHow convenient.\n\nYou realize what a terrible justification that is, right?\n\nI can call you all the names under the sun and if you object, \"I wasn't insulting you, just making an observation\". I can accuse you of every crime there is but \"Im not accusing you, just speculating\". Disingenuous.\n\nDont kid yourself. It was a guilt trip. You know it.

I feel sorry for Carl, you mentioned he sacrificed a lot in his childhood and now on a day as special as his wedding day even THEN his own parents outright announce they expect him to put his brother first?\n\nSure, it would be a wonderful gesture if he voluntarily offered to help with his brothers surgery but it\u2018s ultimately his own choice that nobody has the right to make him feel guilty about. Especially as you mentioned they weren\u2019t close growing up. You owe him a massive apology and a lot of reflection about how much having a disabled sibling has impacted him his whole life.", ">He and Carl weren't close growing up for some reason.\n\n>but he reminded me of how much he sacrificied when he was younger for Ed's sake. \n\nThat's why.

It is not your son's responsibility to pay for his brother's surgery... and it was crass of you to ruin his wedding day by making your unnecessary and cruel observation.", "Yup, YTA, what a terrible time and place to make such \"observation\". He does not owe you or your other son anything. He gets to decide how to spend his money.", "YTA- You are your sons parent, not him. It would be nice of him to chip in sure, but he has no obligation to do so. Someones wedding is supposed to be a day just about them, and he earned his own money and decided to spend it him and his wife\u2019s big day. It also seems like he was neglected a little in his youth for his brothers sake. He deserves to be in the spotlight especially when he bought it himself.", "YTA. Ed is your son and therefore your financial concern.  You have no right to assume or even ask that any money Carl earns should be put towards his brother. \n\nYou should be happy Carl is financially stable and doing well in life so you can focus your energies on Ed\u2019s healthcare.\n\nYou owe Carl a big apology.", "YTA. You already asked and he declined. The AH move was to bring it up again and then you are a double size AH for bringing up at his wedding.", "YTA: Ed is your kid, not Carl\u2019s. And you\u2019re definitely the AH for saying that at the wedding.\n\nLove the edit too, as if you paying for the education now entitles you to any of his money. Your children are not an investment", "YTA. While at your son's wedding, you were counting $$ instead of wishing him well. You were judging him instead of loving him. I'm guessing he has spent most of his life having his needs/wants subordinated to his brother's. On the one day that he should have been able to be blissfully happy, when it should have been about celebrating Carl, you again insisted that his needs should come second to his brother's. He should not have to feel guilty for getting married and experiencing joy.", "> I briefly mentioned to him how he could've helped out with his brother's surgery instead of having a big wedding\n\nYes, you were guiilting him. You brought up your youngest son's surgery, which had absolutely nothing to do with the wedding because you wanted him to \"help\" and he stood up for himself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>he reminded me of how much he sacrificied when he was younger for Ed's sake.\n\nAnd you wonder why they never got along. Are you really that blind? Ask yourself, how many  times did Carl have to miss out on something he wanted or even just wanted to do because your youngest was the priority?\n\nYTA and if you can't see why, then you are too far gone to be helped. At this point, just pray that Carl doesn't just cut contact altogether.", ">> I briefly mentioned to him how he could\u2019ve helped out with his brother\u2019s surgery instead of having a big wedding like that\n\nSo, in other words, your \u201cblessings\u201d weren\u2019t sincere since you think that your son & his wife having the wedding that *they* wanted was a waste of money that could have gone to your ~~favorite~~ other son instead. Got it.\n\nYTA, OP. Your eldest is not responsible for your youngest financially or otherwise, and attempting a well-timed guilt trip *on his wedding day* is shitty. \n\nYour wife is right that you should have kept your mouth shut. This was no \u201csimple observation.\u201d It was you metaphorically shitting on your eldest for daring to have a life outside of his brother.", "Your sons weren't close when growing up, 'for some reason'.  \n\nUh huh.\n\nThe reason would be that you have lost the ability to love your elder son.  You've had to spend a lot of time and money and attention on your younger son, because he needed so much.  But you managed to forget that your elder son needed your time and attention too, that he was just as much in need of your love as Ed was.  \n\nYou are so much in the habit of seeing all things through the lens of your younger son's needs that you couldn't even allow your elder son *one day* to be happy.  His own wedding day, and you had to tell him that he should have spent \\*his\\* money, not on his wedding, but on something for the brother who has, effectively, always taken priority in your eyes.\n\nYour wife was absolutely right.  You will be damn lucky if your eldest ever wants to have anything to do with you again.  You have spent his life, ever since your youngest was born, demonstrating to your eldest that he doesn't matter, and you couldn't even keep your mouth shut on his wedding day!\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just an observation. It was an opinion and a guilt trip. \n\nHere\u2019s an observation for you: you feel entitled to your son\u2019s money.

My observation: YTA. \nApologise.", "YTA. It's Carl's money, and he's allowed to spend it how he likes. There's probably some resentment there. He's allowed to enjoy his life. I'm sorry that it's hard for Ed and he has expensive surgeries.\n\nYou didn't need to make that 'observation'. You spoiled what should have been a very happy day for Carl and his wife by being a dick.", "YTA\n\n\"gave our blessings\" but couldn't help but giving some curses while you were at it.\n\nWhen you speak both blessing and curses you are a duplicitous ASSHOLE.", "YTA. It's not Carl's responsibility to provide financial help. I'm sure he sacrificed a lot growing up, that's usually the case in families with a disabled child. I think he has some sort of resentment misdirected towards his brother. Your wife was right, it was no the time or the place. Congratulations, when your son will think about his wedding he will remember how his own father tried to guilt trip him.", "YTA. Carl has no obligation to help with Ed\u2019s surgery, he\u2019s not the parent idgaf how much money he makes. & then you bring it up at his wedding?? Why do you think you are owed his money? You\u2019re a complete AH. Figure out the money yourself, bc YOU ARE THE PARENT not Carl.", "100% YTA. \u201cEd is disabled and has multiple issues that we\u2019ve been managing since he was 3. He and Carl weren\u2019t close growing up for some reason.\u201d Maybe you failed to consider that you were too busy caring for Ed to bother giving Carl an equivalent amount of attention, maybe even outright ignoring him. This leads to resentment. And in all honesty, paying for a surgery should NEVER become the responsibility of an older sibling unless the parents are not in the picture at all. So what if Carl spent a lot of money on a destination wedding? It\u2019s his money and he can spend it however the hell he pleases and it shouldn\u2019t concern you. If Carl and Ed weren\u2019t close growing up, I wouldn\u2019t expect Carl to have any motivation to help pay for his surgeries which, again, are not his responsibility.", "Carl felt like it was a guilt trip because you were guilt tripping him! Your \"simple observation\" was said in the exact time and place to make him feel guilty in hopes he would give you money towards the surgery which is YOUR responsibility. That's manipulative AF!

Not his kid, not his responsibility. \n\nYour kid, YOU pay", "Yep, you\u2019re a major asshole. Carl deserves a life, too\u2026and doesn\u2019t exist to support Ed.

Full stop. Carl did not get a high paying job to support Ed. Full stop.\n\nInstead of being proud of Carl for all he has achieved, you decide to tear him down bc he\u2019s decided to do what *he* wants to do with his money. \n\nThis can result in you never meeting your grandkids, bc what parent wants someone who feels that everyone else should take care of his (adult) child around their kids?\n\nDude. Ed is *your* responsibility. Not Carl\u2019s. The only one being cruel is **you**.\n\nYTA\n\nETA: I\u2019ll bet my nonexistent lottery winnings that the reason why Carl and Ed aren\u2019t close is bc you and your wife barely paid Carl any attention bc Ed\u2019s the sick child. So you asked your emotionally neglected child to pay for the golden child\u2019s surgery. Carl\u2019s probably gone No Contact on you. Good for him.", "YTA. A colossal AH. Ed is not Carl\u2019s dependent or his responsibility. Just because he has a high paying job doesn\u2019t mean he has to share his money to care for his brother. Just because one child has a disability does not mean you neglect other children. I can imagine that Carl grew up with little attention, cancelled trips or events etc. he is your son, not your ATM.", "YTA\n\nIf you think *this isn't guiltying just a truthful observation* I can understand why you don't know why your two sons aren't close.\n\nLet me guess.

Way to show where your priorities lie, again.", "Going to try to be gentle here cause it might cause some dissonance for you.  YTA.  You seem to have some blinders on.  Mainly the ones where kids who are labeled as abled, are neglected in attention and energy for the less able child.  I suggest to be kinder to your older son to try to repair your relationship but until you can see how you prioritize your younger son.  The situation won't change.  I suggest a good counselor for you to work thru this and help you with stopping trying to financially abuse your son.  Yes trying to manipulate him this way is abusive.  Cause he said no.

To me it sounds like the clich\u00e9 \"Kid has to help disabled child with everything, therefore has to give up their youth and is barely paid attention to\".\n\nCarl isn't obligated to do anything, the fact you brought it up on his WEDDING says enough about where he lies in your priorities.\n\nYTA", "YTA And an idiot, or just a totally self-centered a\\*\\*hole who is so wrapped up in himself that you cannot see what is obvious to everyone else on the planet.

Still not his problem.", "YTA.\n\nOf course it was a guilt trip, and trying to pretend it wasn't is disingenuous in the extreme. And doing it on his wedding day makes it exponentially worse. Just because something is \"true\" doesn't mean it should be said.\n\nI could give an example, but will follow my own advice and not do that.", "YTA. Did you ever think about it from his POV? His entire life was likely overshadowed by you guys paying much more attention to his brother and his brother clearly being the priority. \n\nHe wanted a nice, destination wedding and paid for it himself, and you make him feel guilty for not spending his money on YOUR child? Ed is YOUR responsibility, not Carl\u2019s. Let Carl be happy.", "YTA. Carl has absolutely no obligation to pay for Ed\u2019s medical care.

My other 3 children experience various cognitive and behavioral issues. Before J was sick, there were a few years where there was a lot of focus on her sister. And before that, our youngest presented with obvious delays in all areas by 1. Needless to say, the attention regularly shifted to one child or another for years at a time.\n\nWe have a local cancer organization that does a really great job of making sure the siblings are included and receive special attention. They do talk to the parents but there was 7 months that I basically lived at one hospital or another. I wasn't able to come home for days or weeks at a time. None of it was ideal.\n\nBut aside from that dreadful time, no one has ever brought how the other kids were effected. Not teachers, therapists (PT/OT/SPT/behavioral health), or pediatricians. I've been to counseling with them and it's never been mentioned. They always act like those were just things that happened. They are teen/young adult age now. I know they do have some good memories of the dreadful time but we've never spoken about the rest from that angle.\n\nMy mind is just racing thinking about all of this. They already have trauma. Did this add more to it? How badly did this piece of the puzzle f\\*\\*\\* them up? One son seemed to have magically been born with only our best genetic tidbits. (I was seriously surprised. How did **I** have this child?) He always *seemed* fine. He was diagnosed with autism in his teens. I have been picking my brain for some time now as to how I could have missed that.

My brother and I, to this day, are very close because I see him, recognized his struggles, heard him out, and did my best to help him process his feelings, even today. We especially became closer because we both are now parents.

The best thing is that he move into a group home slowly while we help him transition over time but that's not a possibility.", "Thank you for making a point to do research and not just depending on your daughter to care for him. Too many parents make the bad decision not to have plans in place for this situation.", "My son in law works in care homes like your son might need, although he sounds more high functioning than most of SIL's clients. Many of the clients have plans that include them going home to visit their families on weekends and holidays and other special occasions. They also have organized day programs where clients go out to supervised jobs for 4 hours. (All of this was crazy during covid of course.) The homes \"feel\" can vary alot with the staff. SIL grew up with younger bro who was high functioning Aspergers, so he just has an instinct for clients and bless his heart treats them like extended family. Keep looking and you will find something but it may not be as close as you like. Maybe he can find a place near his sister? Maybe ask her how she feels about it. Find out also if he's entitled to Soc Sec disability, etc.", "If you see my next comment it is agreeing that services for young adults is not good enough. \n\nTotally agree. \n\nThere needs to be better services"]}
