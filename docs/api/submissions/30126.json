We had a small party at our house with mostly family and a few close friends.  There were about 8-10 kids there, including my brother's two daughters (5 & 7).  After presents were opened, the kids were all playing with the toys my son got.  For the most part the kids were playing fine.  But at one point, my brother's 2 daughters were arguing over a toy they both wanted to play with.  We were able to calm them down and everything seemed fine.  \n\nAs the party was dying down and people were leaving, I was starting to do some cleaning and organizing and noticed that the toy my nieces were playing with was missing.  I asked my nieces if they knew where it was because they were the last ones I saw playing with it.  The oldest said she saw the youngest one run off with it at one point.  I asked the youngest one if she knew where it was and she just kept saying she didn't know.  \n\nMy brother and SIL looked through all their bags and stuff and didn't find it, so we are pretty sure it's not with them.  But after everyone left, we looked high and low in our house and couldn't find it anywhere.  We've done a pretty good cleaning of the entire house since the party and can't find the toy anywhere.  We have no idea where it is or what the niece did with it.  \n\nMy son got enough stuff for his birthday that he's not too upset about it, but he has been asking about it and has been helping us look for it.  We've been telling him that his cousin must have hidden it somewhere and we just need to find it and that seems to be enough for him at this point.  \n\nMy husband, however, is pretty upset and wants my brother and SIL to replace it.  I've told him that it's probably in our house somewhere and it will turn up eventually, but he's not happy about it.  It wasn't an expensive or fancy toy, but he says it's the principle of it, not the material value.  \n\nHe told me that I need to talk to my brother and SIL about replacing it, or else he will.  He said he wants to give me the chance to talk to them first because he knows I will be nicer about it than he will.  So, I talked with my brother and told him we still can't find it and asked if he would be willing to replace it.  He kind of balked at it and told me that it will turn up eventually and that they haven't seen it at their place, so he knows his daughter didn't take it.    \n\nWhen I told my husband about this, he was not pleased.  He said that if they want to avoid paying for a replacement, then we will just not get their kids Xmas gifts this year.  I told him that it would be wrong to punish the kids for something like that and he said the nieces were the reason the toy got lost in the first place.\n\nI told him I can't force my brother and SIL to replace it and that I'm sure it will turn up eventually.  But he's adamant that I \"force\" them to replace it or threaten them with not getting their kids Xmas gifts. I feel that is going too far.

Like he said it\u2019s about principle really in laws should be held responsible for a lost/broken toy. Seems like they are just using your kindness for their own interest if they don\u2019t even feel responsible for a toy (or your parents car) what about if they break something very expensive or that has sentimental value.\n\nThis hill he is standing in is much deeper then you realize (actually more like over look) heck why are they making such a fuss about it especially if the toy wasn\u2019t expensive.", "I know others are implying your husband is being petty but this has the straw that broke the camels back feeling to me. He says they\u2019re \u201cusers\u201d which implies they\u2019ve taken advantage of you in the past. He is over it and not willing to let it go because it is affecting his children.

Because on its face, this seems like a silly hill to die on for your husband.", "I would say to take a good look in your garbage pails, both inside and out. A child may have broken it and a parent, maybe your brother, pushed it deep into the pail under the other garbage to hide it. That would be my go-to. And just like your parents' car, your brother doesn't want to pay to replace a broken toy.", "Yta. According to your comments, this is not just about the toy. Also, the toy is still a gift that was given to your child, and your nieces lost it (or hid it). Their parents must take responsibility for that.", "YTA. These girls were playing with the toy. Now it\u2019s gone. Either they have taken it or hidden it or broken it or thrown it in the bin. It doesn\u2019t matter what they did- they have made a birthday present which had just been given to your son disappear. It is your BiL and SiLs responsibility to replace anything their kids break or lose. Your husband is correct that this is unacceptable.\n\n\nYour BIL and SIL have been doing this for years. Crashing your parents car then not paying g for it. Living with them but doing zilch to help out or carry their own weight. Constantly being known for this type of behaviour. This is a pattern and your husband doesn\u2019t want his son being preyed upon and losing his birthday gifts because of his cousins carelessness or theft. \n\n\nIf it\u2019s not even an expensive toy then they should pay for it. If not, your husband is right- no birthday or Christmas gifts, no coming over or playing with your sons things because they cannot be trusted and he doesn\u2019t need to be exposed to people who will take his things and then shrug their shoulders like who cares.", "I don't want to be so harsh to say you're TA but your brother definitely needs to replace the toy.

YOU should replace at your cost it then.", "NTA.   \n\n\nThis is a very odd hill for your spouse to die on. I feel badly your son lost his toy, but it's so not worth all this drama. That he'd threaten \"no Christmas gifts\" to 2 small kids, over a plastic toy, is problematic. Does he often get absolutely inflexibly bent over nothing? Is he usually so petty that THIS is worth losing your brother and SIL over?   \n\n\nYou can't PROVE nieces broke/stole the toy just because they had it last. Your spouse really needs to let this go.", "Have you asked the other guests or is this being blamed only on your nieces?", "NTA and does your husband not realize there were other people at the house as well?  You didn't do a strip-search of every party guest, the obvious answer here is either 1) that another little kid took it, 2) it got hidden by some kid (not even necessarily your niece), or 3) it's just lost in your house by no one's sinister hand.\n\nIt's unbelievable to me that your husband thought this situation merited a phone call, much less repayment or \"no gifts for nieces!\" as punishment.  This is not a normal reaction for a parent in regard to some cheap toy. If this is typical for him then I feel sorry for you and your kids.", "It seems like your husband is being dramatic. Do your nieces regularly take your son's things or is there some other pattern going on?", "YWBTA if you said anything to your brother. There is absolutely no proof that it was stolen or hidden or broken by one of the nieces. Without solid proof, your just starting drama.", "This issue should be dropped, but it\u2019s a good learning opportunity for the kids.

Your brother and SIL went through their things and couldn't find it.  There is no proof that one of your nieces took the toy.  It's altogether possible that it got thrown out with the detritus from the party and no one noticed.  It's also possible that another child at the party was not able to play with the toy because your nieces wouldn't let go of it, and quietly took it home with them.  \n\nNo matter what, it's not worth ruining a family relationship over.  You sound far more level headed about this than your husband does.", "NTA! You said the bags were searched, so you know bro\u2019s family didn\u2019t take it home. Maybe another kid took it home. Maybe it got broken and the niece panicked and put it in a trash can. Did you search those?", "NTA\n\nSince there is no proof that the kids took the toy, asking your brother to replace it is not cool. It comes off as accusatory and petty, especially if it was inexpensive.\n\nYour kid will probably forget all about it soon. Sometimes things we like get lost, stolen, or broken. And thats okay.\n\nYour husband is overreacting and threatening to not get the kids gifts to force you to force your brother to do something is crazy. If he has an issue, he should talk to your brother and not put you in the middle of it.\n\nHis behaviour seems overblown. Maybe a convo needs to be had about whether there are other underlying issues he has with your brother and his family that need to be addressed.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your nieces are brats and your bro and SIL are bad parents. You are enabling them.", "It\u2019s so uncanny I ran across this post, because the same thing happened to me when my kids were little.

But my husband feels like everyone in my family knows to not even try to ask them for help because they will never lift a finger for anyone else.

They have always behaved this way and will always continue to behave this way as long as they are allowed to. If you let them take advantage of your son now, they will keep on doing it to him just like they do it to everyone else. It will not stop with this one incident and it will not end with this one harm. They will keep harming him and all those \"little\" harms will turn into one big collective harm that he may not be able to forgive you for. \n\n\nYou are his parent. It is your job to protect him. You are choosing not to protect him.

Of course there\u2019s a chance that she took it but there isn\u2019t any proof and it sounds like your brother and SIL don\u2019t know anything about it either.  Your husband is awfully comfortable burning bridges on YOUR side of the family because of a hunch he has and absolutely no evidence that your brother or SIL know anything about it.  \nHonestly the best thing to do would be to let this go and make sure to keep a very close eye on the nieces the next time they come around.

The girls know where it is. Did you check the garbage cans? They either destroyed it or took it. I agree with your husband. Let them know that there will be no more gifts until the toy has been returned. And stand by this. Girls need to learn that they cannot behave this way.
