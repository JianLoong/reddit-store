You\u2019re disabled. I can\u2019t stand how some pregnant women are. So entitled. No one told them to get pregnant. They shouldn\u2019t have any special treatment for that.

The seat is for disabled people just as much as it is for  pregnant people.", "NTA Geez. You literally cannot stand on a bus. She can stand on a bus, but it\u2019s uncomfortable. Not the same thing.", "NTA.\n\nJesus christ! What a ... IDEK what to call a person like that.", "NTA, obviously. You have a disability and therefore need a seat, period. An able-bodied person should have given their seat to the pregnant woman if none were vacant... but one was, so I have NFI why she didn't take that one.", "Wait. There was an empty seat and she thought you should give up your seat? NTA.", "NTA. There was an open non-handicapped seat, and there were two seats that she could have asked those preteen girls for. I don't know why she had to bug you so much for yours. And it definitely makes her TA that she insulted you after the fact", "NTA  she's the entitled c.  She felt ok harassing you, but couldn't address teenagers?!?  Then acted like a teenager.  Feel sorry for her future child.", "NTA but she certainly is. The fact there were other seats and she just wanted what she wanted, shows she\u2019s inconsiderate and feels entitled.", "NTA as a previously pregnant person who has gone on many NYC subways and buses", "NTA.   That woman was absolutely ridiculous.\nI had to use public transit when I was pregnant and had no issues waddling my butt towards the back the bus where I normally sat.\n\nSorry that happened to you.

But there were PLENTY of other assholes on that bus with you!!  You have a watertight reason for why you need to sit on the handicapped seating area. It is there SPECIFICALLY FOR people in your position. Either the sleeping man or the two oblivious teenagers should have gotten up so this woman could sit down, but they did not, so she took her anger out on you. Which also makes her a part of this parade of assholes on your bus. She had every right to be pissed that no one would offer her their seat, but she had NO right to get pissed at a person who NEEDS TO USE those seats. She probably felt the most comfortable approaching you, rather then sleeper or bozo the clowns. But that is entirely on her, as from the sound of your story you have a walker with you, that is visible to those around you.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened to you. You didn\u2019t deserve to be called a hurtful name, or treated poorly in the bus in front of other people by someone who sounds angry and obnoxious.

No. Just no. Do not pull that nonsense.
