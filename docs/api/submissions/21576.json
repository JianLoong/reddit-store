It's your house and you have no obligation to take care of late Dad's significant other - especially if she is becoming your financial burden. Sometimes ugly things happen in life and nobody sucks for it.

This alone would make me less apt to allow her to continue living there (what else is she going to 'claim'?)\n\nIf I were to let her stay, I'd 100% draft an agreement between us that explicitly lays out the arrangement and gives the landlord the option to evict with notice.
