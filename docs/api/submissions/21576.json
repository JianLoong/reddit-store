It's your house and you have no obligation to take care of late Dad's significant other - especially if she is becoming your financial burden. Sometimes ugly things happen in life and nobody sucks for it. She should be grateful for your goodwill if you allow her to continue renting from you under market, and should definitely not be trying to coerce or guilt you into doing it. This alone would make me less apt to allow her to continue living there (what else is she going to 'claim'?)\n\nIf I were to let her stay, I'd 100% draft an agreement between us that explicitly lays out the arrangement and gives the landlord the option to evict with notice. Otherwise, you may find yourself in a squatter's rights situation (not sure what the laws are in your state) or she could fight the eviction some other way.\n\nNot legal advice!\n\nEdit: I\u2019m in a similar arrangement with an elderly friend of my grandmother\u2019s.
