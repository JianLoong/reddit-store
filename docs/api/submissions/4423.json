She lives off money she gets from various family members), or to complain about his siblings and ask him to parent them for her.\n\nMy parents paid for most of our wedding, with my husband and I paying for a couple vendors. My mom absolutely loves party planning/hosting so we had a fairly significant budget. His mom had nothing to do with planning.\n\nI wanted to find ways to include her, so I asked if she wanted to join us for hair and makeup before the ceremony. She agreed, so I booked for that many people. Two weeks before the wedding, she decided that she didn\u2019t want to do hair and makeup after all. At that point it was too late to cancel her service, but the wife of one of the groomsmen was able to join us and get hers done instead. Two days before the wedding, his mom called and announced that she wasn\u2019t sure she was going to be attending the wedding because her hair was a mess. I again offered her the hair and makeup services, but she refused. She decided that evening that she would attend the wedding after all.\n\nThe morning of our wedding my husband spoke with his mother, who said she was coming with his brother and repeated the time for the ceremony to him. Fifteen minutes before I was supposed to walk down the aisle, my wedding planner came up to my getting ready room and announced that his mother wasn\u2019t going to be there in time for the ceremony. She had already spoken with my husband, who decided to go ahead without her. MIL showed 20 minutes after the ceremony, just in time to be in pictures and enjoy the reception.

I\u2019d had enough and snapped that \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t know because she didn\u2019t actually attend the wedding itself, only the reception.\u201d She wasn\u2019t thrilled with that, and Thanksgiving kind of blew up.
