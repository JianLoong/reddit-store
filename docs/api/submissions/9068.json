She wasn\u2019t angry at me, just totally devastated that my teeth were no longer perfect. Scared the crap out of me! It was a small chip and my dentist fixed it with resin. I\u2019ve had to replace it twice over the years, but certainly no big deal.\n\nBut I later found out that my mom received no dental care as she grew up, and ended up losing all her teeth, having full dentures when she was in her twenties. I had no idea as she never told me, likely due to embarrassment. It was a huge secret that I didn\u2019t find out until I was in my late teens, when a cousin told me. And until she passed away nearly forty years later, I never discussed it with her. It was a major trauma for her that she didn\u2019t want to share, so we just left it alone.

It's truly shocking the stuff parents will say. One told me she told her daughter she would take her to the dentist as punishment if she did something wrong. The little girl had never even gone, and was afraid.\n\nAlso, some people equate an extraction with being poor, or it means you did something wrong with taking care of your teeth so it would be embarrassing. It shouldn't be, but we dont know what lies were fed to her. \n\nBut the real question is did she ask you to keep it private? If so, you could have just said she had a procedure. No one needs to know what procedure.\n\nWhile I agree her reaction is fairly extreme, you don't know what pain she is through about this, without having others know. \n\nSo my answer is INFO did she ask you to not mention it?", "Within the context of the U.S., nice teeth have historically been a status symbol of wealth and general \"goodness\".  Those with bad teeth are often looked down upon in society.  Losing a tooth most likely triggered feelings of shame, guilt, and unworthiness in your wife.  \n\nTrauma's gonna trauma.\n\nI had horrible teeth as a little one and became incredibly tooth conscious.  If I lost, broke, or damaged a tooth unexpectedly, I would be in an extremely bad place psychologically. \n\nNAH", "Tooth loose", "Such an overreaction. Like who cares? I once broke a chunk of a molar off trying to open a nail polish bottle with my teeth. Not my finest moment. Still told everyone. lol", "Found the asshole", "i actually got a tooth pulled recently, and while it hurt like a bitch and i was loopy from pain meds i never screamed at anyone  \nbut yeah OP, her behaviour was not ok. if this is a common occurrence in your household i would suggest looking up a domestic abuse hotline", "That's not an excuse. Pain is not an excuse for being a jackass; this wasn't a \"big\" family secret, it's a common practice; I've gotten a tooth pulled, I'm not going to lie, it hurt for a while.\n\nWife needs to cool it, her freaking out shows at best immaturity at worst, that she can't face reality and be truthful to her family without freaking out; it's a tooth, not half her body.", "This. Defiantly NTA, and the wife shouldn\u2019t have acted that way\u2026but I am also insanely private about my dental care. It\u2019s all shame. (Which is stupid, I know.) I would have wanted to react the same way if my husband told someone about my dental work. In fact i went so far that i have specifically asked him NOT to tell anyone last time I had stuff done. However I defiantly *wouldn\u2019t* act that way bc it\u2019s just not ok to lash out like that.", "And the kids are between 11 and 15. My kids are those ages and parenting duties mainly consist of getting them to and from school, making sure they do their chores and reminding 11 to shower.", "So she prefers that your kids are also afraid of dentist? Why is she making a big deal out of a broken tooth, did she break it doing something she shouldn't have been doing? This is also baffling to me. NTA", "Not pain, but pain meds. If this is how she normally reacts\u2026hoo boy.", "*definitely", "So, the kids aren't suppost to know, why Mama isn't feeling well? I mean, if it was a sex accident i would understand, but a dentist appointment?", "Are you fucking nuts?"]}
