She wasn\u2019t angry at me, just totally devastated that my teeth were no longer perfect. Scared the crap out of me! It was a small chip and my dentist fixed it with resin. I\u2019ve had to replace it twice over the years, but certainly no big deal.\n\nBut I later found out that my mom received no dental care as she grew up, and ended up losing all her teeth, having full dentures when she was in her twenties. I had no idea as she never told me, likely due to embarrassment. It was a huge secret that I didn\u2019t find out until I was in my late teens, when a cousin told me. And until she passed away nearly forty years later, I never discussed it with her. It was a major trauma for her that she didn\u2019t want to share, so we just left it alone.

If it\u2019s close to time for a dose, it should be \u201cout of her system\u201d enough that she behaves more normally.

At the same time, pain is a real problem and you are right that many people's pain isn't given appropriate treatment.\n\nI have tried and failed to resuscitate people who overdosed on opioids. In 2022, 110,000 people died from opioids. And the most common source of opioids for naive users of all types is from a medical prescription-either theirs or a friend's. There are situations where opioids are necessary, and there are ones where they aren't. Pain management is important, and after procedures it can be necessary to prescribe opioids for a short time, but sometimes the risks outweigh the benefits to the patient.\nAgain, dental procedures can definitely require opioids for a few days after the procedure, but let's not pretend that there is no merit in being judicious with the prescription of one of the largest causes of death in the country.\n\nETA: I also forgot to mention that opioids aren't even as effective as NSAIDs once you're a day or two out from the procedure because most of the pain is inflammatory.", "In 2023 PTSD is the new OCD.
