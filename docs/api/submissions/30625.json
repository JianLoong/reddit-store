Because that's who grandma asked.\n\nOp then finds out her sister when behind her back to change the recipe and the grandma completely accepted it without confirming.

That was planned weeks in advance. Now that it has been changed without notice a day before and only found out the day of, op only choice is to either accept it, or to not accept it. Accepting it means that she will tolerate her sisters and grandma's behavior. Canceling is a very clear announcement that this will not be tolerated.

Your grandma just wants to spend time with you and you're squabbling over the home cooked meal she's going to prepare for you? She's not a restaurant, she's your family!

Makes me miss my own badass grandma", "That would be lovely. I would give almost anything to cook with my grandmother again. She died 28 years ago but I will never forget how loved and safe I felt with her. I named my daughter after her. (Disclaimer I have had a beautiful childhood but a loving grandma is so very special)", "Yes, I think you should have gone anyway, to spend some time with your grandma. You didn't have to drive your sister and if you dislike the chicken dish rather than just being bored by it you could have proposed that you pick up some take out, or bring whatever you were planning to cook and make that for yourself and grana once you got to her house, so he still got to hang out with you but your sister's sneak y behaviour wasn't rewarded.\n\n  \nAs it was, you punished your grandma as well as your sister, and you made it very clear to grandma you weren't interested in seeing her unless there was free food of your choice available, which is pretty mean behaviour.", "I\u2019m a grandma and I would feel so confused wondering, I tried to do something nice!! Now, I have 2 AH\u2019s mad, I\u2019m alone. How will I get hurt next time I try to do something nice??", "Yes there is. To go see her grandma.

Grandma is being punished for just being a grandma", ">Now both sister and grandma know not to fuck around with you \n\nWhat in the actual hell are you talking about in regards to the grandmother? OP\u2019s sister lied to her grandma saying both siblings wanted chicken and rice.", "This is such bullshit. You think most caring people are going to not believe their grandchild when she tells them something with no prior evidence of under handedness? Cause by grandma's reaction she didn't expect to be lied to. Your post just reeks of your own insecurities and issues projected onto OPs. Grandma was nothing but a sweet old lady by all accounts of OP and she felt so entitled to a meal she punished her grandma for what her sister did by not going to see her grandma at all. Honestly if this is the thought process that goes through your head during a scenario like this I just feel sorry for what ever life experiences led to it.", "I mean, it's pretty obvious that the sister would probably be uninvited after grandma called to bitch her out. Either by grandma or herself due to anger or hopefully shame. So I don't think OP still going would condone her sisters actions. Neither do I think that would signal to grandma that this type of thing is ok as her actions already shows what she thinks of that type of thing. The only thing OP did was show her grandma that a meal being ruined is enough for her not to want to see her. Which shows what OP prioritizes.", "Yep. If OP had gone the message would be \u201cOP will accept being pushed aside in favor of Sister\u2019s desires, but Sister throws fits when she doesn\u2019t get what she wants, therefore I\u2019ll cater to Sister because OP will keep the peace.\u201d\n\nI was the peacekeeper for way too long. It wasn\u2019t until I started hurting some feelings that I actually got noticed and occasionally catered to.

And for not learning to make her blackberry pie. I'm so thankful that that's all I regret, because I did spend the time with her every chance I got, even if it was just to stop in for 10 minutes. But I can't believe these two.", "Absolutely this.", "I came here to say the same thing. OP both you and your sister are huge AH. Go buy your grandma a card or flowers and apologize. Go spend time with her now and drop this petty nonsense. \nNot everyone has a loving grandma they can go to for family dinners. I would love to have one more dinner with my grandma but I didn\u2019t even get to say goodbye because it was during the Covid lockdown. Go give your grandma a hug and tell her you love her.", "OP will just visit her again without her sister next time. Do not advocate for letting awful people get their way.", "And the grandma, on the night before for something planned weeks in advance, has decided to change what op wants based on the word of her sister asking for what she wants. It's not about the food at all. It's about the lack of respect of both the sister and grandma to change the plans last minute and not tell the original person. Not to mention op only found out about the changes minutes before leaving. Given that the meal is a specialty meal requested by op, it shows favoritism to swap it last minute and a lack of respect by not notifying the requester about the change.\n\nImagine you ordered a specialty item and it will take a bit to arrive. And then you find out that your sister has used your account and changed the order. You never got any email about any changes. First you'll be upset because a close relative has decided that your specialty item isn't as important as her typical order. Then you'll be upset at the provider because they didn't notify you to any changes to the order. You were betrayed by a close relative and noticeably not thought about by the provider.  As a result you have decided to not pick up the package.\n\n\nWhen the reason for coming to grandma's that night was for the meatballs, and the meatballs were swapped to something else, there is no longer a reason to go for dinner. The punishment is not coming for dinner. It is a very proportional and appropriate response to what happened.", "When someone offers to make you something you expect them to make it and not the thing someone else wanted. If that does happen you at the very least tell the original person that the request has been changed. It's basic respect to notify people that the plan has changed in advance. Grandma explicitly showed favoritism towards the sister by changing the meal plan last minute from what op requested weeks ago to what the sister requested a day ago.\n\nYou don't realise this but this is a classic sign of a golden child. Grandma and sister fucked around and dinner got cancelled. Why everyone here is treating it like op is going full NC with both of them. She just didn't go to dinner and told the grandma why. That is a very appropriate and proportional response to the situation.", "Grandma shut down OPs sister as soon as she found out. In what world do you see this person letting that type of thing continue? If anything grandma lost a lot of trust in sister now and will most likely be making sure of anything sister says by double checking with others. OP just punished grandma for being manipulated.", "Except the fact she called sis to bitch her out for changing the meal in a sneaky way. She is in no way an AH here", ">She must know what this sister is like\n\nWhy? Granddaughter is 16, and they don't live together. If I told my grandma that my sister changed her mind and wanted a different meal, she would not assume I'm lying. I think you're making a bold, and probably incorrect, assumption about the grandma. Her reaction makes it clear she is upset that granddaughter lied to her, and it was a surprise.", "Grandma\u2019s a badass!!", "Except golden children don't get a call and bitched out for what they did. Since you know? They're the golden child. Sounds like grandma had her trust taken advantage of and was told by sister that OP and her changed their minds. Grandma's only mistake was trusting her grandchild. Sister fucked up her trust with her family for a meal and OP shows she cares more about being fed than spending time with her grandma who has her back by all accounts.", "Grandma presumably knows her grandchildren so would know OP loves those meatballs and is less crazy about the always on offer chicken and rice. So either she switched without bothering to ask OP because she doesn\u2019t know her well enough to know she wouldn\u2019t ask for chicken and rice over meatballs, or she knew it and switched anyway because OP usually doesn\u2019t put up a fuss. \n\nI think Grandma is pretty low on the asshole spectrum. Not even sure I\u2019d call her an asshole if she genuinely just doesn\u2019t know her grandkids that well, but in that case I also wouldn\u2019t blame OP for not feeling like visiting without the lure of meatballs. I had a great aunt like that, I\u2019d visit for food and/or if she asked me to come over, but she just wanted someone to tell all about her own grandkids (who were of course VERY superior to me in every single way, even if they never visited her) and didn\u2019t really care who I was, I was just a willing audience. I don\u2019t hold that against Auntie, and I cried very genuinely for her when she passed away. \n\nBut our relationship was very transactional in hindsight and I\u2019d have skipped a visit if she offered me her best dish (it was a mushroom and pasta thing that she swore was \u201cnothing at all\u201d but I loved it and she sure liked to hear me tell her how tasty it was.) and I found out instead she was making something I hated. If she TOLD me ahead of time the menu changed? Eh, I might be miffed but I\u2019d still go over to change her lightbulbs and clean her gutters out (her grandkids were too busy I guess). But the day of? No. Just no. \n\nIf grandma DOES have a close relationship, then I do feel like she is the teensiest, weensiest bit an asshole. But the sister is the main asshole here, with OP having some assholery credit depending on whether those meatballs are or are not the main reason to visit Grandma. \n\nAnd as a disclaimer, if you come from a healthy, loving family, none of this will seem \u201cright\u201d to you. But everyone else is giving advice through their own experiences so I am too.", "Mad at her for lying, wasting her time and ingredients cooking a meal that wasn't what was asked for. Grandma should be telling sister if she wants that food she can come and buy it.", "You can clearly only see the world in black and white. How is it so hard for you to understand that it's a lack of respect to not notify the original person of the change. Grandma fully believed that OPs favourite meal got changed to sisters favourite meal and didn't think to mention it at all. Even if it was just a \"hope you're looking forward to the chicken tomorrow\". The sister being blindly believed is golden child syndrome. Just because grandma recognized it after op mentioned it does not mean it's not occurring. Grandma should be applying her love equally and op showed her that she isn't. That she will preferentially choose the sister over OPs request.\n\nNot coming to dinner after finding out the dinner has been changed from your preference to someone else's preference is an appropriate and proportional response to the disrespect. Whenever plans are changed they must be confirmed. A third party changed the plans and the original party was never made aware.", "You make so many presumptions based on your own upbringing while ignoring what is clearly said by OP about her grandma's reaction to the situation to have this narrative though. If OP didn't want to hurt her grandma's feelings she'd have never told her she's getting bored of the chicken and rice. And if grandma really disregarded what she wanted she wouldn't have reacted so strongly to her sister for lying or bother to apologize to OP.

You for bailing on your grandma. Your sister for lying to your grandma to change the meal. Your poor grandma has done nothing wrong. \n\nHowever, you can fix this (and you need to). Call your grandma and sincerely apologize for bailing on the dinner. Tell her you were wrong to do that, and you made a bad decision in the moment while you were angry at your sister without thinking about how rude it was to your grandma. Tell her how much you appreciate that she was going to make dinner for you and that you were looking forward to spending time with her. Ask if you can reschedule your dinner with her and if you can come over early to help her make the meatballs. Even if you're bad at cooking or you hate it, it doesn't matter. Spend the time with her.

Although for sister that's most likely out the window now. And I really can't explain this any more than I already have.
