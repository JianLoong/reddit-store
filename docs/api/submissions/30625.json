My sister (16f) was supposed to go with her but had to change plans last minute so she\u2019s staying home with me. \n\nLast month my grandma said she wants to make a meal for me while my mom was away and asked me what I want. She makes these really great meatballs with like 3 or 4 different kinds of meat, ricotta cheese, garlic, onions, tomatoes, and idk what else. They\u2019re huge and they taste amazing. She rarely makes them though. I asked for those.\n\nToday my sister reminded me that we had to go to grandmas and said something about chicken and rice. I said no, grandma\u2019s making meatballs and my sister said that she doesn\u2019t like meatballs so she called grandma yesterday and said we want chicken and rice instead. Grandma makes chicken and rice almost every time we see her. Honestly I\u2019m kinda sick of it but my sister loves it so she always asks for it. \n\nI was pissed. I was looking forward to these meatballs all month. I told my sister to figure out her own way to get there because I wasn\u2019t going then I called grandma and said that I\u2019m not gonna go to dinner tonight because my sister changed the meal to something I don\u2019t really like without asking me. Grandma was apologetic and said she\u2019ll talk to my sister then she called my sister and yelled at her. She told my sister not to bother coming over for dinner. I didn\u2019t cook for my sister either and she refuses to eat things like cereal, sandwiches, bagels, etc. so she didn\u2019t eat tonight. \n\nShe thinks I\u2019m a bitch for tattling but she had to cancel the one meal I never get to eat just because she wanted some freaking chicken and rice that grandma already makes for us all the time. \n\nAITA for not going to grandmas and telling her why I didn\u2019t go?", "created_utc": 1699511307, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17r6unj/aita_for_skipping_dinner_with_my_grandma_and/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your feelings about missing out on a meal you cherish are valid. It might be helpful to share your disappointment and talk to Grandma about how much her meatballs mean to you, and that you'd love to have them another time. It's essential to express how much you value the meal without letting it affect the family ties, especially with your sister. Maybe in the future, you both can find a way to alternate the meals Grandma prepares to make sure everyone gets to enjoy what they like.

But by the time you're 18, you put on your Big Kid pants and don't cancel dinner because grandma didn't make your special meatballs, even if it was your annoying little sister's fault.", "Sorry about your grandma, but OP's grandmother doesn't seem to be mean. OP's just a spoiled, awful brat and so is her sister", "Normally I would agree with you and yes normally it isn't a big deal, like when you  are in a restarant and  they don't have the dish you wanted you try to find something else and not just leave and of course never blame the waitress for it. \n\nBut come on everybody know situations like when you are looking forward to a mcdonalds ice cream or similar things and they tell you the mashine isn't working . you don't scream at them or make a big fuzz but your day can still be ruined because your needs are not satisfied , you may eat something else but you still feel like something is missing because your body was craving for something . I think many ppl know this feeling and this feeling sucks . when she was waiting for the meatballs for a whole month because it is so rare that her granny make them mainly because lil sis won't eat them and she was looking forward to eat them for a month then why can't she feel at least upset about it ?", "No one is saying OP can't be upset, but she's throwing a tantrum at the wrong person.  The person who was paying and making a complex meal for them  in the first place.  Most adults (and clearly there seems to be some exceptions on here), would understand it's not Granny's fault and would still go to dinner, given that she had spent all this time cooking a meal, who now, nobody is going to eat."]}
