I'm more of a if it works, it works kind of guy, especially when it comes to food. I don't mind how a meal looks when it's cooked, as long as it tastes nice. Presentation is more a big deal to her and she'll take longer to plate things and make things look pretty. \n\nNow, the issue. Given that I am more of a morning person out of the two of us, I have taken it upon myself to cook breakfast more so she can lie in a bit in the morning. In return she washes up so it evens out. \n\nJenny loves a fried egg on toast for breakfast. She's made them before for us and I noticed she always centres her yolk. I think it's slightly over the top of her to go to all the effort she does to make them perfectly centre - she'll separate the yolk and whites and then slow cook the white and place the yolk in the middle after (I just slap the whole egg it in the pan and let it cook). \n\nI never realised how big a deal it was to her that her yolk was centred because this morning, she asked me not to make them unless the yolks are in the centre. Her reasons being that when the yolk is off to the side, it all dribbles off the white when the egg is cooked and she claims there is yolk wastage. She also claimed she's asked me before about the yolk but I don't listen? She might have but I don't remember having a conversation about it. \n\nI think the whole thing is ridiculous and told her that I don't see the big deal and just think it's more washing up to do and that if I'm going to make breakfast I'll cook what I want for us (given she has input as well of course). I made us eggs this morning and she just grabbed an apple instead and left for coffee. \n\nIt's not like she has OCD or anything. I think she's being stupid and don't see why I should have to change how I cook my eggs when it's easier and quicker and less washing up for her anyway.", "created_utc": 1676798307, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11665cx/aita_for_refusing_to_make_a_perfectly_centred/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let her do everything for herself and you do you!", "NTA. She's being very rude. When someone cooks for you, it's inappropriate to refuse to eat something that you think is slightly imperfect.\n\nIf she refuses to eat the eggs you made, there is whole egg wastage.\n\nA silicone egg ring will ensure that the yolk is on top of the egg white, but it won't be \"perfectly centered.\" It seems like that might not be good enough for her.\n\nShe is clearly bothered by this to a degree that isn't normal. She should really examine why this egg issue is important enough to her to be worth causing conflict in her relationship with you.", "I mean - preparing to get downvoted - YTA a little. \n\nI am the same about bagels. I have a thing where I need to eat my bagel as soon as humanly possible when it comes out of the toaster, if I\u2019m having one with just butter. It just ruins it for me, if you wait for two minutes because you\u2019re doing something else, and then you eat it and it\u2019s only warm and not hot and the bagel bread\u2019s gone a little tough and it\u2019s just worse than no bagel at all for me at that point.

I know they think it\u2019s weird.

For heavens sake you're going to the trouble of making her breakfast but refusing to cook her eggs the way she likes them? Just do it! So what if you think it's unnecessary? We all have our little preferences. Gently shake the egg by turning it upside down a couple of times before you crack it. The yolk will be in the centre when you crack it. It's not a great deal of effort. If this is her only little quirk then just do it, even if you think it's a bit silly. Doing little things like this for each other is cute. I have a cup I like for my coffee in the morning. If my OH makes my coffee he'll use that cup, even if it's dirty and other cups are clean, he'll wash the cup that he knows I prefer, just as a little sweet guesture. I find it adorable, and I do similar with other things for him. I guess it's a \"love language\".", "NTA. Make scrambled eggs. This is a weird hill for her to die on. I\u2019ve never heard of this.

But if she\u2019s trying to tell you how to fold towels, how to arrange her 16 throw pillows on the bed, the order in which you must sweep/vacuum the rooms of the house, etc., then she has a clinical issue and doing it her way is no longer being nice\u2014it\u2019s enabling her issue.", "Whoops replied to the wrong comment with this but I will push more for her to get tested but she isn't as intense about any other facet of our life. \n\nWe have talked before about why I can't just crack it into the pan but she says that she takes into account how I like things when she cooks so why can't I do the same?

At no point did I say \u201cYOUR GF HAS OCD\u201d", "I have a feeling it's not about the egg, dude. She pays very close attention to details, and details are important to her. She probably pays close attention to the way you like things and takes pains to make food just how you like it-- whether you notice or not. You don't really care about the details, so for you getting her eggs wrong is no big deal. You just cooked an egg, and an egg is an egg. To her, this is basically the same as you saying you value her preferences less than she values yours. Its probably been a lot of little things that she's mentioned or done a certain way that gets brushed aside and the eggs were straw. \n\nApologize for not realizing how important the little details are to her and try to do better. Maybe that means making a centered egg or two, I dunno. It's your relationship, you decide what's important.", "She's annoyed over an egg! She even decided to be rude and not eat something you prepared for her simply because the yolk isn't centred. This reeks of entitlement, especially when you say she doesn't have OCD.\n\nMaybe twist it back in her to show her how ridiculous this is by refusing to eat her perfectly presented meals and make a point of saying that you can't eat it because it's too perfect and she needs to start making them imperfect so you can eat them. If she sulks or complains about it you can tell her that this is how you feel when she turns her nose up at your eggs that you loving made her so she can sleep longer.", "She doesn't cut through the whites and toast at the same time if that makes sense. She'll cut through the whites so the yolk flows between the two and then soaks in.

I think an apology is in order", "100% the girl needs a trip to a 3rd world country for a bit of humble pie ASAP.

And she's doing the dishes so who gives a damn about a bowl. Like that's actually your argument? It's weird man. \n\nSo again, I really don't see the big deal. You are being ridiculous.

What an insanely odd hill to die upon by choice.", "You don\u2019t need a bowl, use the egg shell to separate the egg and hold the yolk", "Oh my bad, it's more like the yolk has to be centred respective to the white's shape. The whites could be rectangular or oval-shaped and she'd still centre the yolk", "She does prioritise where the yolk goes by separating the two and placing it in the centre before the white is fully cooked so it heats the yolk and it sticks to the centre", "This is how my kid taught me. She's 10 and one of her favorite recipes calls for this. If a 10 year old can do it then so can OP!\n\nPlus it's actually good skill to have. Loads of good recipes call for this skill.", "Not you! It's me not getting it. \n\nShe likes it that way because then the yolk soaks into the bread? \n\nBut actually how does the white affect the soaking action of the yolk?", "Because it's centred on the white and then the white has to be centred with the bread so when she cuts into the yolk, it will sit into the middle of the bread and doesn't leak out on the plate when she cuts the white. It is confusing yes but whenever has her fried eggs, no yolk gets on the plate because it doesn't overflow past the bread.", "That is confusing, but I think I get it now. Thank you. \n\nGood luck together. If this is the worst disagreement you have, it sounds like you're all good."]}
