I'm more of a if it works, it works kind of guy, especially when it comes to food. I don't mind how a meal looks when it's cooked, as long as it tastes nice. Presentation is more a big deal to her and she'll take longer to plate things and make things look pretty. \n\nNow, the issue. Given that I am more of a morning person out of the two of us, I have taken it upon myself to cook breakfast more so she can lie in a bit in the morning. In return she washes up so it evens out. \n\nJenny loves a fried egg on toast for breakfast. She's made them before for us and I noticed she always centres her yolk. I think it's slightly over the top of her to go to all the effort she does to make them perfectly centre - she'll separate the yolk and whites and then slow cook the white and place the yolk in the middle after (I just slap the whole egg it in the pan and let it cook). \n\nI never realised how big a deal it was to her that her yolk was centred because this morning, she asked me not to make them unless the yolks are in the centre. Her reasons being that when the yolk is off to the side, it all dribbles off the white when the egg is cooked and she claims there is yolk wastage. She also claimed she's asked me before about the yolk but I don't listen? She might have but I don't remember having a conversation about it. \n\nI think the whole thing is ridiculous and told her that I don't see the big deal and just think it's more washing up to do and that if I'm going to make breakfast I'll cook what I want for us (given she has input as well of course). I made us eggs this morning and she just grabbed an apple instead and left for coffee. \n\nIt's not like she has OCD or anything. I think she's being stupid and don't see why I should have to change how I cook my eggs when it's easier and quicker and less washing up for her anyway.", "created_utc": 1676798307, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11665cx/aita_for_refusing_to_make_a_perfectly_centred/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For heavens sake you're going to the trouble of making her breakfast but refusing to cook her eggs the way she likes them? Just do it! So what if you think it's unnecessary?

Asking is not the same as demanding. She didn\u2019t make a fuss about it and chose to eat something else for breakfast, like an apple and coffee. She\u2019s N-T-A for that.\n\nIt\u2019s also okay for him to not prepare the eggs in the only way she likes and eats them. It would be a nice gesture towards a person he claims to love, but he isn\u2019t obliged to do so. He\u2019s N-T-A for that.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay that he ridicules her food preferences and calls her stupid. That\u2019s disrespectful and AH behaviour.\n\n\u201cshe asked me not to make them unless the yolks are in the center\u201d\n\nShe explicitly told him upfront she doesn\u2019t want to eat eggs on toast unless they are prepared in a certain way. That\u2019s saying **no** to him cooking breakfast for her. \n\nBut he chooses to ignore it, knowingly makes her eggs in a way she doesn\u2019t like and expects her to eat it anyway, because he thinks her food preference is ridiculous and she\u2019s being stupid. And now he\u2019s whining about it and complaining she didn\u2019t eat his eggs. That\u2019s definitely worthy of a YTA vote.", "She's picky about her eggs, let's not pretend it's more than that", "And make her own damn food.", "So I was about to tell you toad in the hole is sausages in batter but turns out it\u2019s something entirely different in America. TIL.\n\nMy family call what you call toad in a hole, a camels eye.", "This is it.\n\nYTA for not respecting her request, which was not \"you must do it perfectly\"; it was \"*please don't* make these if it's not the way I want it.\"\n\nSo, in making it your way (instead of something else, or giving her the centered yolk), you actually made yourself the AH.", "NAH I agree. I would 100% never cook her an egg again, just calmly prepare her something else. I understand where she may be pissy he didn\u2019t listen to her but having to center a yolk would suck the joy out of making breakfast for me. I say this as someone who has metal rings and little kitchen blow torch to make food look pretty, but  centered yolks are a nope for me.", "A metal ring mold usually helps center a yolk. Cheap and you get perfectly round eggs.", "Hard disagree here. He's making the breakfast specifically so that she can get a lie in. To refuse to eat something someone has cooked for you over something so stupid is a big AH move, especially when they're doing it as a favour for you.", "Honestly OP. This is one of those things that, you don't morally have to do. But if you like someone and it isn't that much effort to try and center the egg, why die on this hill? \n\nBeing in a relationship isn't about being right or being an asshole for disagreeing. It's about deciding to go with someone on life's journey together. And I guarantee little shit like this can really be the difference in a good relationship. \n\nIt's a tiny thing you find dumb but you know she appreciates. If it's so dumb does taking the half step out of your way hurt you at all? My guess is no. And if there's minimal cost to you to make her happy isn't that an easy cost to pay?\n\nI'm not saying move mountains for her happiness. But in a relationship if everyone just takes the tiny little half steps to do the minor thing they know their partner enjoys even though they think it's dumb, there would be a lot more happy people out there.", "I voted NAH on this one. My suggestion for you would be to attempt to cook her eggs the way she prefers because you care about her. If it is a finesse task that is too difficult to execute, that's fine. \"I tried to cook your egg the way you like, but I'm just not good at it.\" is way different from, \"I'm not going to try to do something complicated because I don't think it is important enough to make the effort.\" But don't mess it up on purpose to get out of it. Weaponized incompetence is shitty behavior.", "Just make something else on your days. Scrambled eggs, cheese omelette, porridge, egg on rice, or what have you.", "Bullshit. Wanting your eggs centered is a sign of being picky. Her reasoning wasn't even anxiety based. Let's not psuedodiagnose people on the internet", "Evidently to her the eggs she wants vs the ones you make are as different as if e.g. she asked for the yolk to be fully set and you brought one that was still liquid. I've had partners and friends whose tastes in eggs baffled me but I just make them how they like it. \n\nAlso I want to thank you for this post because I make eggs like you and have spent my whole life low key annoyed by the yolk being near the edge of the toast. Never thought to reserve the yolk and place it in the centre! So now I have a solution (for when I can be bothered).", "> Here's an easy fix she can do:\n\n1. Cook it her god damn self.", "If she doesn't want to eat something she doesnot have to eat it. It doesn't make her an asshole.", "I only specifically said that in agreement with the comment I responded to saying they are guessing some type of OCD/neurodivergence *and* because OP said she hasn\u2019t been diagnosed\n\nI maybe spoke too specifically, so for that I do apologize. I did not mean to insinuate or armchair diagnose her with anything, but I do think that he is wrong to assume she is not in some way neurodivergent and use that as a reason to dismiss her request.", "Read on, please. \n\nIt could be anything. The point is op can\u2019t say she isn\u2019t and neither can anyone else here she is. All anyone can really comment is that she may want to consider looking into it.", "I think entitlement is to expect people eat the food you cooked when they asked you not to. Op is welcome not to cook for her, she doesn't have a problem with that.", "OP won't let her cook it herself because that makes too many dishes", "She could also just flip the whole fried egg upside-down  and stab the yolk. That way the yolk also soaks in the bread.", "Fair enough, just saying neurodivergent would have been fine I think. I do apologise for being harsh,  it just gets tiring when the term ocd is thrown around so much .", "So I shouldn't say she isn't but your comment says 1000% sure she IS nuerodivergent?", "Where on earth did he say that?\n\n\n>Now, the issue. Given that I am more of a morning person out of the two of us, I have taken it upon myself to cook breakfast more so she can lie in a bit in the morning. In return she washes up so it evens out.", "I mean if you read further I clarified the comment you\u2019re responding to. I\u2019m not interested in continuing this discourse further though so have a good rest of your day :)", "\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f mess", "My gran taught me to do this when I was a kid. Extra caveat though: if you\u2019re doing a lot, have one dish that you work into, but then pour the white into a separate dish to collect them. Saves you having to start over if one yolk breaks.", "I get what your saying but what the other person is trying to sY is so could still center the yolk on her bread the white would just be slightly off. I mean if she is that anal she could cut off the white part that is slightly off and move it to the other side of the bread.", "She could also cut the white first and then cut into thr yolk after. Then there is no leaking either.", "If the yolk is off-centre in the white, you can still make it centred on the toast.\n\nThen the *white* will be positioned a bit lopsided on the toast, but the yolk should still soak the right way into the toast."]}
