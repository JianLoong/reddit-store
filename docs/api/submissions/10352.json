I'm more of a if it works, it works kind of guy, especially when it comes to food. I don't mind how a meal looks when it's cooked, as long as it tastes nice. Presentation is more a big deal to her and she'll take longer to plate things and make things look pretty. \n\nNow, the issue. Given that I am more of a morning person out of the two of us, I have taken it upon myself to cook breakfast more so she can lie in a bit in the morning. In return she washes up so it evens out. \n\nJenny loves a fried egg on toast for breakfast. She's made them before for us and I noticed she always centres her yolk. I think it's slightly over the top of her to go to all the effort she does to make them perfectly centre - she'll separate the yolk and whites and then slow cook the white and place the yolk in the middle after (I just slap the whole egg it in the pan and let it cook). \n\nI never realised how big a deal it was to her that her yolk was centred because this morning, she asked me not to make them unless the yolks are in the centre. Her reasons being that when the yolk is off to the side, it all dribbles off the white when the egg is cooked and she claims there is yolk wastage. She also claimed she's asked me before about the yolk but I don't listen? She might have but I don't remember having a conversation about it. \n\nI think the whole thing is ridiculous and told her that I don't see the big deal and just think it's more washing up to do and that if I'm going to make breakfast I'll cook what I want for us (given she has input as well of course). I made us eggs this morning and she just grabbed an apple instead and left for coffee. \n\nIt's not like she has OCD or anything. I think she's being stupid and don't see why I should have to change how I cook my eggs when it's easier and quicker and less washing up for her anyway.\n\nETA - I see now this is not about my way being a good way to make them, it's about her preference  and that I wasn't actually doing a nice thing for her. Thank you to everyone who commented with ideas about to cook a centred egg with minimal fuss. I have already apologised to her but I am going to make her some eggs tomorrow to make up for it. \n\nTo everyone calling her childish and anal for having a preference, that a bit uncalled for.

For heavens sake you're going to the trouble of making her breakfast but refusing to cook her eggs the way she likes them? Just do it! So what if you think it's unnecessary?

Asking is not the same as demanding. She didn\u2019t make a fuss about it and chose to eat something else for breakfast, like an apple and coffee. She\u2019s N-T-A for that.\n\nIt\u2019s also okay for him to not prepare the eggs in the only way she likes and eats them. It would be a nice gesture towards a person he claims to love, but he isn\u2019t obliged to do so. He\u2019s N-T-A for that.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay that he ridicules her food preferences and calls her stupid. That\u2019s disrespectful and AH behaviour. \n\nHis girlfriend has no problem cooking breakfast for herself, but he wants to do her a favour because he knows she isn\u2019t a morning person like himself but likes to lie in.\n\n\u201cshe asked me not to make them unless the yolks are in the center\u201d\n\nShe explicitly told him upfront she doesn\u2019t want to eat eggs on toast unless they are prepared in a certain way. That\u2019s saying **no** to him cooking breakfast for her. \n\nBut he chooses to ignore it, knowingly makes her eggs in a way she doesn\u2019t like and expects her to eat it anyway, because he thinks her food preference is ridiculous and she\u2019s being stupid. And now he\u2019s whining about it and complaining she didn\u2019t eat his eggs. That\u2019s definitely worthy of a YTA vote.\n\nEdit: Just a generic tip for OP.

The only way you would get yolk wastage is if a) you broke the yolk and b) you didn't bother to scrape it all onto the plate. Maybe she wants all her yolk runny? That's fine, but again, it's still only going to be wasted runniness if the yolk is broken. Does she not know how to crack eggs?\n\nAlso, let's just go back to this:\n\n>she'll separate the yolk and whites\n\nUnless she's doing that while keeping it in the shell, she's wasting egg whites. If she is able to separate them while keeping the yolk in the shell then fair enough, but if that's the case then she's probably able to break an egg without cracking the yolk too. Something here doesn't add up.\n\n>She also claimed she's asked me before about the yolk but I don't listen?\n\nWell, that's probably true. It's clearly something important to her so she's going to remember and feel strongly about it, while you probably didn't realise quite how important it was until now so it wouldn't be at the forefront of your mind.\n\n> I told her that I don't see the big deal\n\nWell no, neither do I.

Make yourself food and clean up your own dishes.
