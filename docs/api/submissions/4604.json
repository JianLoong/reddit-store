I asked her what that was about and Cindy says her mom won an IPad at work, but they already have an IPad that no one ever uses, so her mom's going to turn down the gift. I was like, wait, I want it! So Cindy ran down to ask her mom and when she came back, she said her mom said I can have it! I was so happy! We have just one computer for all of us (mom, brother, and I) and it's annoying having to share. And we pretty much only get to use it for school because my brother and I are both in high school so it's not often that no one needs the computer for school.\n\nI was so happy! But my mom heard everything since the computer is in the living room and she got so mad at me for asking for the IPad. She said I shouldn't be asking for such a large gift and my brother agrees that I'm the AH for asking for it.\n\nSo yesterday, Cindy's mom dropped off the IPad and it's an IPad Pro with a keyboard and pencil! I'd be able to use it for school and won't have to share the computer with my brother! But now my mom is making me feel so guilty. She's not forcing me to return it exactly, but she's saying I should gift Cindy something of similar value if I don't give it back. I looked up how much everything would cost and no way I'd be able to afford it. But they didn't want it, so was it wrong of me to ask? I'm playing with it now, but feel so bad about it. But I feel like I did nothing wrong!\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone! I talked to my mom a bit more and as long as I only use it in the living room or dining room, she's okay with it. She thinks the IPad will be easier to hack or something, I don't understand, but now I don't feel guilty anymore!

That way she is saving money when she wants to treat herself. \n\nYour mom is a soft AH, I can understand her apprehension. As an older person with more experience,when someone is given a gift, some people feel like you should be indebted to them, and your mom probably just doesn't want to feel like she owes her something. Know what I mean? But once she knew the iPad winner was cool with it, and didn't do it expecting something in return, she should have laid off the harping about it.", "NAH. Generally speaking, your mom would be correct in being concerned about you asking for and accepting an expensive gift, however in these particular circumstances everything seems kosher. \nBut PLEASE follow your mom\u2019s advice (only to a point!) and bake a batch of cookies or purchase a bouquet of beautiful flowers, as a thank you gift (or simply send a thank you note).

A hand written thank you card or letter with perhaps a bunch of flowers, (or maybe a home made wreath since it\u2019s seasonal) would be both polite and appropriate. \n\nYour mum is feeling pressure to reciprocate, likely from pride at not wanting to feel like she is not providing for the family.

Not wanting to appear to be taking or needing from others or to owe anything to another person. \n\nIf you keep it, definitely show your appreciation for your friend's mom. Lacking monetary repayment, perhaps helping put with yard, or other tasks around their house might be a nice gesture.

If she didn't take them, they would just go to a thrift store, yet her mom insisted her daughter refuse it all.  All because she recieved it for free, so it must have been given out of, horror of horrors, PITY.  And her pride simply wouldn't accept anyone thinking she was poor.  (Which she was)\n\nSounds like your mom is much the same considering her insistence that you compensate them with something of equal value.  It's just to keep up the facade of not being poor.  Well, in this case, the object came to them for free.  The dollar amount they paid was 0$.  So, considering you've been grateful and take care of it, you've already compensated them for the cost.  \n\nYour mom also needs to consider how embarrassing it would be for the other mom to find out that an item she gave away for free because she didn't want it ended up costing it's recipient a large sum of money.  She didn't give it to you intending to make you indebted to her, so throwing some fancy thing back that you spent actual money on at her would likely only make her uncomfortable because her gift became a burden. She might then feel obligated to return THAT favor because you spent money and it goes on and on.\n\nYour mom needs to see that it would be rude to put the other woman in that position.  Bake cookies or something for her.  That would be more than enough.  And ignore your brother.  He's just mad that you got something and he didn't", "NTA. Cindy didn't give it to you; her mom did.

It's so hard with my brother in senior year and every assignment has to be typed up. We often stay up until 2 or 3 am taking turns on the computer. My school has a program where they lend out laptops but my mom won't enroll us because we won't be able to afford what we'd have to pay if we break it. So I was so excited that this is almost like a laptop and it would make our lives so much easier!", "Thank you!

All you did was get excited and ask if you could have it. You were really happy that Cindy and her mom agreed. If you were feeling entitled or (potentially) upset at being denied that would very quickly change the judgement, but that is not at all what you said. \n\nINFO: A gift is a gift, but did Cindy get to keep the new one or did her mom straight up give you the one they'd won? Either way, that's a great friend.", "NTA - It didn't cost her anything, she won it at work, and she could have easily said no. Zero guilt.\n\nYou should absolutely send a thank you card (with a handwritten note, go old school on this one) and do something nice to show your appreciation, but this situation does not need an expensive gift.  \n\nI think your mom is feeling a bit of insecurity that you asked and essentially told Cindy's mom some of your economic situation and your brother is probably jealous that you got an iPad while he is sharing the family computer with mom. (or you having one undercuts his argument for getting one since now he no longer has to share with you)", "NTA, but I do sympathize with your mother; it\u2019s probably a pride and guilt thing for her. She might feel like she failed in being able to provide things that other kids have, doesn't want to take handouts since they're not \u2018earned\u2019 and is maybe a little jealous. Talk to her, let your mom know how difficult things are for your and your brother (she maybe isn't fully cognizant of it), and that this iPad will be very useful to you + your studies.\n\nThis isn't necessarily your job, but try to also reassure her (if possible). Let her know that you love her and everything she does for you guys and you'll keep working hard. Unrelated, but I appreciate how authentic and grateful you seem. Those are good qualities so don't lose them.", "NTA! Definitely hand write Cindy\u2019s mother a thank you note, but beyond that, you do not have to buy her anything.", "NTA.\nMaybe buy some flowers as a thank you and as acknowledgement for such a kind act from her.\nBuy definitely NTA.\n\n\nThere's a saying I live by in live. \"If you don't ask, you don't get\"", "NTA If I were Cindy's mom, I would have given you the iPad too. I'd feel honored and lucky, to be honest, that the windfall had been given me so that I could pass it on to you. It feels good to help people. You def ought to give her something back -- a small bouquet of flowers now, and good grades going forward. This internet mom is proud of you.", "NTA. The problem with your mom's idea is that Cindy's moms value of the iPad was effectively 0, she didn't want it. I'm not saying don't do something nice for her, but it doesn't have to be anywhere near that expensive. Get her some flowers, or bake her something, or use the iPad to paint her a painting. Just something to show you're thankful.", "NTA, if Cindy's mom is okay gifting you an iPad, then mom and bro need to stay in their lane and just say thanks", "NTA but get her mom a nice gift of thanks with a hand written card. And something for ur friend as well", "NTA. Honestly I'm not sure what it is with the older generation but apparently you're not allowed to get anything for free from anyone. I remember in like middle school I got a dollar from a friend (a straight up 1 dollar bill) and good lord my dad went off for like 30 minutes and told me to give it back (I didn't but I said I did).", "NTA. Have you explained that her mom was going to turn it down, not take it and sell it?", "I get the feeling the OP's mother is jealous that her daughter has an ipad and she doesn't. The OP should put a lock on it. If my child had been gifted an ipad, I'd be so grateful to her friend's mother.", "Send a written thank you note. Not a text, handwritten. Make sure you fully express your appreciation and how much it means to you.\n\nBelieve me, resurrecting the lost art of the formal thank you will mean more to the giver than any material thing you can provide.", "Second the apple care. My pencil fell last week and I was able to get it replaced completely free with the apple care within 24 hours. Buying the new pencil would have been the same cost as my insurance in the first place, and I still have coverage if anything happens to either the pencil or my tablet which is such a relief.\n\n(I think it's normally $29 replacement, but I had called about it instead of going in to a store and the guy was really helpful/nice)\n\nEdit: worth noting I think you can only insure one additional thing with your tablet. So either the keyboard or the pencil. Keyboard is more expensive, but IMO pencil is more easily broken. Loosing does not count towards insurance, your SOL if that happens so make sure your case has a slot for the pencil. Also enable Find My in the settings and make sure that's set up in case you ever need to GPS locate your device.", "Thank you card, maybe gift her some of her favorite food/desserts? Something to show appreciation but it definitely doesn\u2019t have to be equal in value", "Make some art to go with the flowers.\n\nCindy\u2019s mom gave you a gift at no cost to herself. It was very generous, and I bet she\u2019s chuffed that you cherish it so much. \n\nYou are not compelled to give Cindy or her mum a gift to the value of an iPad. That\u2019s not how gifts work.", "NTA but make sure you do something nice for your friends mom.", "Maybe bake your benefactor a cake to say thank you.", "NTA. honestly you asked and it seems they were willing to give it. your very lucky to have a friend like that. I think that they deserve something nice. flowers, chocolate, something nice. \n\nI can understand the mother's side though as she could be worried that it might spoil you but the brother saying your the AH for it is dumb. although it might be jealousy but I don't really know. just my thoughts on it.", "op=NTA\n\nand yes, doing something nice for Cindy's mom is a great idea(maybe Cindy can help you plan/figure something out).  \n\nPS bro is just jealous.", "NTA.  They didn't need it, they didn't want it, and you do.  It was no charge out of their bank accounts.  They WON it.  To give it to you was just as valid as you winning it instead.", "Glad the edit has good news. Doing something nice for Cindy's mom is a great idea! If you like drawing, there's plenty of fun apps for free on iPad that you can use to make a fun thank you piece of art.\n\nOtherwise, even a card that describes how the iPad has helped you in school can be good, too! It's always nice to hear how a gift of yours helped someone else.", "NTA- I however love how your friend and her mom did this for you. It\u2019s totally something I would do for my child\u2019s friend. \n\nIf I were you I\u2019d just write Cindy\u2019s mom a hand written note thanking her and how you will be able to use this for school and how appreciative you are. To me as a mom, nothing is more thoughtful than a hand written note.", "Write a beautiful thank you note and perhaps give her mom something like flowers or something homemade that requires effort from you.  This doesn\u2019t require anything terribly elaborate, but just something that expresses your deep appreciation.  NTA", "Along with a very nice thank-you note.", "When I was a kid, video games at home just became a thing. My parents friend had an atari for his kids and when we went there we would play with it. One day when we were leaving he pulled out an atari for us. My mom tried to say no, but he insisted it was for us. The whole family used it for years.\n\nYour mother doesn't want something she hasn't earned because money. Is an issue. And she is embarrassed that your friends mom knows this. Or at least she is assuming that is why you are being given this.\n\nJust enjoy it and use it for school. Send a thank you note and token gift, flowers, candle, something she likes. \n\nYour mom will come to terms when she sees how much time it frees up for you and your brother.", "OP should invest in a protective case.", "Yes! My parents sold their car for a ridiculously low price to my sister's brother and sister in law (so my parents had met them a few times but didn't really have a relationship with them). They wrote the sweetest, most heartfelt thank you note (along with a nominal thank you gift) that explained the difference the vehicle was making in their lives. My parents talked about that thank you note for a good year afterward. Essentially giving them the car was not a big deal to my parents (my sister and I weren't interested, they didn't need the tradein) and the thank you not really touched them.\n\nI understand why OP's mom might have been concerned - you don't want your kids to come across as entitled or anything, but it sounds like it wasn't much trouble for the friend's family so a genuine thank you note along with a nice gesture sounds perfect."]}
