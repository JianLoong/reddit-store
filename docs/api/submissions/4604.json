I asked her what that was about and Cindy says her mom won an IPad at work, but they already have an IPad that no one ever uses, so her mom's going to turn down the gift. I was like, wait, I want it! So Cindy ran down to ask her mom and when she came back, she said her mom said I can have it! I was so happy! We have just one computer for all of us (mom, brother, and I) and it's annoying having to share. And we pretty much only get to use it for school because my brother and I are both in high school so it's not often that no one needs the computer for school.\n\nI was so happy! But my mom heard everything since the computer is in the living room and she got so mad at me for asking for the IPad. She said I shouldn't be asking for such a large gift and my brother agrees that I'm the AH for asking for it.\n\nSo yesterday, Cindy's mom dropped off the IPad and it's an IPad Pro with a keyboard and pencil! I'd be able to use it for school and won't have to share the computer with my brother! But now my mom is making me feel so guilty. She's not forcing me to return it exactly, but she's saying I should gift Cindy something of similar value if I don't give it back. I looked up how much everything would cost and no way I'd be able to afford it. But they didn't want it, so was it wrong of me to ask? I'm playing with it now, but feel so bad about it.

Your friend\u2019s mom sounds like she was happy to give it to you. I think many people would offer an unwanted prize to others before declining it. I\u2019ve given away movie and restaurant passes that I won. I hope your mother comes to see that you did nothing wrong. Not many things in life are free, but this was. Good on you for asking for it.", "NTA. It was free and the mom loses nothing by you having it \n\nShow your appreciation by writing a thank you card saying how much the gift will help you in school. Maybe buy a grocery store plant or small flower arrangement as a token of thanks.

But as a kid, this is sufficient", "NTA.\n\nYou sound very appreciative. So let them know.  Write a really nice thank you letter.  Honestly you can crib quite a bit from here.  School was hard because\u2026 , but this gift helps you and your brother do better in school by\u2026.  Bake some nice cookies and give it to them with the gift.  Something of equal value doesn\u2019t need to mean equal cost.  The cost to her and you was zero.  That\u2019s not where the value is.", "NTA\n\nHonestly it sounds like some people are a bit jealous. As long as Cindy's family is fine, nothing is to be guilty about.\n\nI don't know your mom's issue with it. Pricey or not, a gift is a gift. No one should expect payback when they gift something away, it's a kind gesture so learn to accept it, don't be so difficult, it makes everyone involved uncomfortable.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is dealing with some unresolved feelings of her own, that have nothing to do with you\n\nBUT if you want (though you're under no obligation to), you could do something less-expensive to thank Cindy and her mom in return, like making them some art or a thank-you cake or something", "NTA.  Your mom and brother are weird for objecting.  Your friend didn't need or want the iPad, and it cost them nothing. You live in a house where three people share one computer.  This helps solve that problem.\n\nGive the mom a very nice thank you card, and don't just sign your name.  Write something saying how much you appreciate it and how it will help you in school.   Congrats on your new computer!", "NTA!! Your mom should be thankful! Its a nice thing to do that didn't even cost anyone any money, and you had no idea what it was all worth when you asked. Like the saying goes, \"it never hurts to ask.\"\n\nWorking hard and doing good in school is also a way the let her know you appreciate the gift. I would maybe try to get something for her that is useful if you wanted to reciprocate. Like a gift card ro where you know she gets coffee regularly or where she gets her nails done. That way she is saving money when she wants to treat herself. \n\nYour mom is a soft AH, I can understand her apprehension. As an older person with more experience,when someone is given a gift, some people feel like you should be indebted to them, and your mom probably just doesn't want to feel like she owes her something. Know what I mean? But once she knew the iPad winner was cool with it, and didn't do it expecting something in return, she should have laid off the harping about it.", "NAH. Generally speaking, your mom would be correct in being concerned about you asking for and accepting an expensive gift, however in these particular circumstances everything seems kosher. \nBut PLEASE follow your mom\u2019s advice (only to a point!) and bake a batch of cookies or purchase a bouquet of beautiful flowers, as a thank you gift (or simply send a thank you note). But absolutely no need to spend more money than that to express your appreciation for such a generous gift.", "NTA at all. You do not need to gift Cindy's mom because she **won** it. It was hers to give away. Your mother and brother are sour grapes because they are envious. As a mother myself, I would've been so happy to see this happen to any of my kids especially if it means freeing up time on the other computer.", "NTA. \n\nIf they didn't want it why your mom and brother would care about you getting something that someone just wanted to turn down and for free too. They should be happy for you.\nChildish behaviour from parent/brother right there. \n\nAlso you don't owe \"cindy\" anything else than gratitude.", "NTA.\n\nI ended up with my first Amazon Echo from slightly similar circumstances - my mom won it in a holiday raffle in her office, and my mom did computer security stuff professionally, so she\u2019s deeply opposed to smart home devices.\n\nYou\u2019re right, this was something that didn\u2019t cost anything to the giver, and will make a big difference to the recipient.  An actual hand-written thank you card would be a good move - they aren\u2019t common anymore, so it\u2019ll be a good sign that you DO appreciate this as an important gift.", "1. Cindy\u2019s Mom (and Cindy) has given you an *amazingly* generous gift. You should be very grateful and thank her. A small gift you can afford would be nice, even if it\u2019s just homemade baked goods! It\u2019s the thought that counts.\n2. You did nothing wrong. What you\u2019re hearing is jealousy from your brother.\n3. Get a good case for it. (https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-ipad-pro-cases/). My son and I both \ud83d\udc9c our Zugu cases. Alternatively, invest in a good keyboard case, and you have a fabulous laptop. (https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-ipad-pro-keyboard-cases/)\n4. It will be great for school use, while you\u2019re at home. I wouldn\u2019t risk taking it in, for fear of breakage or theft.\n5. I swear my (adult) son\u2019s iPad has been surgically grafted to him somehow, as it is *always* in use. Best gift ever! \n6. I was admittedly jealous, given my ancient, slow, full iPad Pro.

I\u2019m pretty sure she feels happy she was able to help you. The appropriate response to such a large gift is not another gift of a similar value, but gratitude. A hand written thank you card or letter with perhaps a bunch of flowers, (or maybe a home made wreath since it\u2019s seasonal) would be both polite and appropriate. \n\nYour mum is feeling pressure to reciprocate, likely from pride at not wanting to feel like she is not providing for the family.

I suspect it is more superficial.  Not wanting to appear to be taking or needing from others or to owe anything to another person. \n\nIf you keep it, definitely show your appreciation for your friend's mom. Lacking monetary repayment, perhaps helping put with yard, or other tasks around their house might be a nice gesture. Showing them your success in school and a thank you would also be a huge reward from any parent's perspective", "NTA. I\u2019m sure you already expressed your thanks.

Imo choose something small and heartfelt, if you don't have a lot of money make it yourself. Like writing down a thank you card in rhyme or something like that.", "NTA\n\nI had a cousin who recieved clothes from a friend that was getting rid of them.  If she didn't take them, they would just go to a thrift store, yet her mom insisted her daughter refuse it all.  All because she recieved it for free, so it must have been given out of, horror of horrors, PITY.  And her pride simply wouldn't accept anyone thinking she was poor.  (Which she was)\n\nSounds like your mom is much the same considering her insistence that you compensate them with something of equal value.  It's just to keep up the facade of not being poor.  Well, in this case, the object came to them for free.  The dollar amount they paid was 0$.  So, considering you've been grateful and take care of it, you've already compensated them for the cost.  \n\nYour mom also needs to consider how embarrassing it would be for the other mom to find out that an item she gave away for free because she didn't want it ended up costing it's recipient a large sum of money.  She didn't give it to you intending to make you indebted to her, so throwing some fancy thing back that you spent actual money on at her would likely only make her uncomfortable because her gift became a burden. She might then feel obligated to return THAT favor because you spent money and it goes on and on.\n\nYour mom needs to see that it would be rude to put the other woman in that position.  Bake cookies or something for her.  That would be more than enough.  And ignore your brother.  He's just mad that you got something and he didn't", "NTA. Cindy didn't give it to you; her mom did.

It was free to your friend's mom, so it's not as if you asked for an expensive gift that she had to pay for. You do not have to gift her something in return because, again, it was free!

Not a necessary but it would just be nice.", "I feel like there's something else too but my mom won't talk about it. She gets along fine with Cindy's mom and she like Cindy she comes over often. It's so hard with my brother in senior year and every assignment has to be typed up. We often stay up until 2 or 3 am taking turns on the computer. My school has a program where they lend out laptops but my mom won't enroll us because we won't be able to afford what we'd have to pay if we break it. So I was so excited that this is almost like a laptop and it would make our lives so much easier!", "Thank you! Cindy's mom told me today she was just about to write the email to turn it down when Cindy ran down. Maybe if I tell my mom that, she'll feel better about.", "Agreed. OP needs to do something really nice for Cindy and her mom.

Just make sure to thank Cindy and her mom and stop feeling guilty!", "That something else is pride/ego. I'm guessing your mom doesn't like that she can't provide you with the things many other kids have, and feels she's failing in that area. Pride can get in the way of accepting kindness from others, no matter how much it might benefit the family. \n\nYour mom may not know exactly why she's lashing out and guilting you, but she shouldn't treat you this way.
