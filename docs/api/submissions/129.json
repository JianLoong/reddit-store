Don't get me wrong, I love his mother. She is the kindest person and the mother I never had. But she is struggling for money as she is already paying for his older sisters bills as well as her own houses bills. Working sometimes overnight to afford basic living while his sister and father both use their pay checks as spending money. And I am worried he will go the same way. She has already cried to me several times about how she doesn't know how she can keep going this way and having to refuse opportunities to keep the family going. \n\nHe seemed to take this talk as me just complaining about not being able to spend money as freely as him and offered to let her pay for my half aswell. This made me furious as he clearly doesn't see his mother's struggle. I refused. Then the today, she offered to buy us a new bed, one of the things on my half of the house. She showed me the bed Bf had picked out and it is worth over $1000. I again refused as even if I was to let her pay for something, that price is ridiculous for a bed. She seemed sad and relieved by my answer however Bf is pissed. He thinks I'm being unreasonable and that moving out is supposed to be fun not stressful. \n\nIve spoken to a few people and they all say it's her money and I should accept her offer because it saves me money. Or even that I'm being rude for saying no. But the more I think about it, the more I feel like I can't accept this.

You really happy being with someone who'll use their own mother to fund a carefree lifestyle at her expense, when he could take responsibility for himself?\n\nYou want to risk him treating you the same some day?

On a more personal note, I'll say outright that I think this behavior is gross and a major turn off. \n\nInitially I was thinking \"it's not your money, it's not your family, not your fight\". But this is clearly an unhealthy and harmful dynamic. For both of them, but especially your boyfriend's mother since she obviously needs that money now.

A higher one.", "The way he treats his mother is how he will treat you. Think long and hard about moving in together.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nKick him out, ask his mother to move in. He seems perfect to live with his father and sister, they can all be irrisonsible together untill they hit shit together.\n\nYou sound like a compassionate person.

There are some times where its polite to accept things (while still being under no obligation to do it).\n\nThis is not one of them. Her whole family are essentially financially abusing her, your partner included, and they see absolutely nothing wrong with it. Do not support it. Do not allow it. Support her and see if she needs you to help advocate on her behalf.\n\nI would also have serious second thoughts about your partner if he is willing to do this. Maybe you should kick out the partner, and have his mother move in with you instead?", "NTA. But I would rethink this whole moving in together thing. Your BF is clearly not ready to be your partner in the household. He seems to expect that his responsibilities would be done for him by someone else, and it's a legitimate concern that he may impose that role on you in the future.", "NTA.

It\u2019s time to sort out your financial approaches and how you will divide things, because it doesn\u2019t sound like you are compatible.

It seems you care more about her struggles than her own son, which says a lot about him. I\u2019d think twice before moving in.", "NTA but surely you see the ENORMOUS red flags with this guy??? He's going to end up not being able to pay for his half of the rent, bills, food...\nYikes!
