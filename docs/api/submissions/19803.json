I\u2019m 29 and my wife is 25. She\u2019s also five months pregnant. Recently we decided to go on holiday together - nothing fancy, just to the coast, which meant we had to get a train. We had maybe three rolling suitcases, and one of those army-style backpacks. \n\nThere was no issue as we boarded the train, and we sat down and put the luggage next to us. About twenty minutes into our journey, we heard an announcement over the speakers that the train was being diverted, which meant it wasn\u2019t going to stop at the station we needed anymore. As it was saying this, the train was coming to a stop at the next station. \n\nI panicked and told my wife we had to get off or we weren\u2019t going to be able to get where we needed. I got up and started grabbing our things, and rushed off the train. I couldn\u2019t believe it when I looked round and saw she hadn\u2019t gotten off - she was trying to grab our third suitcase (I had the other two and the backpack). Unfortunately it was too late, and even as I rushed to the doors, they closed. My wife looked like she wanted to kill me, and the train pulled away with her on it.\n\nI called her to tell her to get off at the next stop and I\u2019d get the next one and meet her, but she was absolutely irate and told me the holiday was cancelled and she was going home. To top it off, she told her family and mine and they\u2019re all furious at me for \u201cabandoning\u201d a pregnant woman on a train \u201cheaded God knows where\u201d with a heavy suitcase.

Why panick over something so little, you could have just stayed on the train and discussed with your wife what you guys were gonna do.   \nYou sound like one of those people that would reverse on the highway because you took the wrong exit, instead of just taking the safer but longer way around.", "YTA\n\nYou panicked and acted very rashly. You didn\u2019t ask her if you, as a couple, should get off. You didn\u2019t make sure your pregnant wife was able to keep up. Very inconsiderate all around. \n\nYou could have asked her what she felt like doing. You could have been chivalrous and had her get off first, or at least stand in the door to make sure it doesn\u2019t close before she could disembark. \n\nStop putting the word abandoning in quotation marks as if that isn\u2019t exactly what you did.", "YTA.\n\nYou should\u2019ve figured that your *pregnant wife* may not be as nimble as you are. I can\u2019t imagine not taking the time to make sure she\u2019s with you, or at least impeding the train doors, something to that effect (easier said than done, depending on the railroad, in fairness). \n\nYour wife overreacted IMO by cancelling the entire vacation, but you definitely screwed up. I don\u2019t see how, even with this being a total accident, you feel \u201cin the right\u201d here.", "YTA\n\nIn such a case sticking together is more important than getting out at the right stop. You should have made sure she was right behind you when getting out especially when she had to wrangle a heavy suitcase while pregnant. Which she shouldn't be doing at all by the way, it is against medical advice for pregnant women to carry heavy things. Her health and the health of your unborn child matter more than getting out the train.", "YTA you chose the most impractical way to travel with 3 suitcases and a bag, and left her with the heaviest one. You should know that your wife isn\u2019t as nimble as you. And why were you panicking? You walked to the other stop just as fine so why not talk to your wife and find a new game plan? There was no need to panic in such a way that you did. You say it\u2019s your autism but I don\u2019t believe autism causes this kind of behaviour (although if I\u2019m wrong someone please correct me). \n\nPerhaps cancelling the holiday was far or telling your family but you did leave her on a train.", "YTA Why did your pregnant wife have to carry the heavy suitcase? Why carry four pieces of luggage on a not so fancy holiday while traveling with a pregnant person, by train? Why didn\u2019t you leave the train together?

Entirely.\n\nThe dilligence youve been given is due.", "Lmao so YOU absolutely had to get off at that stop no matter what, but it was fine for your pregnant wife to get off at the next stop and circle back? And you still feel like you were in the right? No dude. You treated her in a totally cold and uncaring way. If you had done it in a moment of panic and later regretted it that might be one thing, but doubling down on it now in the cold light of day makes you MASSIVELY YTA.", "YTA because you just left her there??? You didn\u2019t stop to check if she was exiting! Also why three suitcases? You said it was \u2018just to the coast\u2019 which is probably a week or less.", "YTA. It's better to make sure you both look out for each other than get off at the right stop. I know anxiety with sudden train changes can cloud judgement, but please keep this in mind if this happens again.", "YTA. Dude. You panicked over a train stop and left your very pregnant wife behind\u2026. I\u2019m not surprised she reacted the way she did.", "You told her to get off at the next stop and if you had waited, you could have walked off the train together and continued on your journey.

You were very, very wrong.", "YTA\n\nI understand you wanting to get off, but panicking and rushing off the train to the point you don't pay attention to your wife? Where exactly was the third suitcase that your (5 months pregnant) wife was still trying to grab it? Overhead storage or something? You should have helped her get the third suitcase from wherever and allowed her to get off first.", "YTA.  As all your family already say.  All you thought about was yourself and your agenda.  Next you\u2019ll be leaving kids behind because you get flustered.  Your poor wife.", "YTA. It wasn't really worth the panic. You could have gotten off at the diverted stop and used that time to discuss your plans. Instead you created a bit of a frenzy and didn't ensure she was able to get off in time.", "I don\u2019t want to fully say YTA, it\u2019s more like you\u2019re the dum-dum. You didn\u2019t mean to abandon her and it was obviously a mistake, not malicious. You panicked and had a dum-dum moment. Take this as a learning opportunity. Your wife may not be able to keep up with you while she\u2019s pregnant, and it doesn\u2019t stop there! Your new baby won\u2019t be able to keep up with you either. You\u2019ll have to adjust and learn to wait up for others once you\u2019re a dad.", "YTA\n\nin panic mode you can\u2018t just think about yourself. You have to check if the person in need/with you has understood the issue and if they are following.\n\nIf your panic response doesn\u2018t improve and change asap you\u2018re not fit to be left alone with a baby.\n\nAnd that\u2018s probably what she understood and why she\u2018s so furious. She sees you as someone who\u2018ll abandon the family when in panic instead of sticking together and planing together. \n\nLittle incidents like this will show how you\u2018ll react with bigger/other issues. It\u2018s something like an eyes-opening event.\n\nIf you were just the two of you, fine, she can deal even if it was a stupid move, but her mind is already set on family and future and therefor has to picture how it\u2018s gonna be with a little helpless being around you.", "Oh boy. YTA. You shouldn't have gotten off without checking she was right behind you. The panic was unnecessary. You'd have been fine at the other stop.", "YTA. You panicked about something little in comparison to the outcome that you got. And i dont get it, you could just make sure that she was out and then you or just go down on the other station and take a taxi or something to go where you originally wanted.", "You were in the right? How? My guy, have you lost your mind? YTA", "YTA. You should have made sure she got off first. Pregnancy makes us slower, and it\u2019s hard to bend over. Wherever she was grabbing the third suitcase from seemed like it took her longer. You could have talked to the conductor. Either way you were literally only focused on you and not your wife. Just apologize.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019d be the asshole if she wasn\u2019t pregnant, your definitely the asshole as she is.", "On trains,planes or in house fires the first rule is always 'rescue the spouse and kids'.

That doesn't mean it wasn't AH behavior even if it wasn't intentional, and now you are in a calmer place you can think through how it feels from someone elses perspective.\n\nYou panicked, reacted, that was bad.  Be sorry for it.  But, she is 5 months pregnant, going through all sorts of changes in her body.   She may have experienced  exactly the same sort of irrational feelings you did that caused you to panic.   Why would you get a pass for that and she doesn't get one when she is literally carrying your baby?

Hopefully you can talk it over once things calm down a bit.", "Please start working on you panicking over trivial things as fast as possible. My mom was like that.

It took me years of therapy to becomemore relaxed and start seeing situations for what they are and not panic over minor things you have little to no control over.

Absolutely.", "YTA", "I wouldn\u2019t call you an asshole, rather an idiot", "YTA - staying on with her, overshooting and figuring out a joint plan would have been rational rather than running off and leaving her.", "I wouldn't say YTA because it was an accident and you didn't do it on purpose. However I will say that you were ignorant in the situation and next time you should probably try to be a little bit more aware of your surroundings.", "You're right, the title does sound crazy. \n\nNot gonna say YTA though.  Should have probably stayed on the train and asked the conductor what was going to be done about people needing to get to your stop.

You could have hustled to the exit area but ensured she was right there with you before stepping off. That way even if you missed the stop, you'd have been together.\n\nAccidental, obviously, but mostly down to being a bit thoughtless and oblivious.\n\nBut your wife's reaction also seems a bit OTT given that it was still an accident.

Being 5 months pregnant is not the handicap most here are insinuating. My gosh even 9 months pregnant one could handle a suitcase. She overreacted.  Sorry your vacation was canceled. Maybe this was a final straw in a list of many things that upset her though. That\u2019s the only thing I can imagine.", "Going against the grain but NTA.

What will you do if you lose control of the pram? What if a cat comes towards you on the footpath? What if the baby falls off the changing table? What if they're choking on something? What if your wife faints while she's pregnant?\n\nThe way I handle these things to avoid analysis paralysis is I choose a top priority. For example, under any circumstances that are dangerous, my most important task is to get my child in my arms and out of the way. Then I think through the scenarios in which that wouldn't be good and plan the exceptions, e.g. if I'm dizzy (get on the floor then grab the kid), if the danger is only directed at me (get myself out of the way then grab the kid), if my kid has hurt himself in a way that might cause Slovak injury (comfort him without moving him until injuries are clear). \n\nStaying in close proximity to a vulnerable family member is usually the best course of action, even if it causes other issues. You learned that in this situation. So gentle yta cause you should know this about yourself and have prepared mentally for how to handle anything that feels like an emergency when you're with your pregnant wife.

I've never once lost him, which I can't say for any of my other parent friends. You can handle this but you need to do it differently than allistic people.

NTA", "I started to read through some of your replies and really sympathized for you\u2014and still do\u2014over your austism, so I was going to go with soft YTA, but then I reread the post to fully process my feelings and after, I\u2019m going with YTA.\n\nIt was soft YTA simply due to the fact that many of us fellow neurodivergent people tend to do/react to stress or other stimulants in different manners. I really sympathized with you about being panicked in the moment, but all of that felt like it was brought to an end with the \u201cI feel like I was in the right, but my family and friends have other ideas,\u201d line. If, after all of those people are in your life, telling you that you were in the wrong, and you still can\u2019t try to sympathize and see WHY you were in the wrong, I simply don\u2019t find it right. I also don\u2019t think if you can accept that you were in the wrong based off of your family and friends opinions, you aren\u2019t going to change your mind based off of random internet strangers and their opinions. But either way, you asked for our two cents so I\u2019ll give mine. Seeing that is what made me change my opinion from soft YTA to YTA.\n\nOverall, I know life can be VERY hard sometimes with autism or ADHD, OCD, etc.. It\u2019s okay and should be completely normalized to talk about all the beautiful and the ugly that comes with mental health. We\u2019re all different and some of us just have our extra quirks that make us even more beautiful and unique. With that, I do think the moment you start/continue to make excuses for your mental health like; \u201cI\u2019m autistic so I panicked in the moment,\u201d\u2014which you replied to another comment with\u2014AND you continue to use that excuse to justify why you think \u201cyou were in the right,\u201d then that is not okay. It\u2019s okay to panic and it\u2019s okay to mess up. We\u2019re all human, none of us are meant to be perfect. But when you keep making excuses for your mess ups, that\u2019s when bigger problems arise. From a fellow neurodivergent, it really sucks, but when you can fully accept what you did and why you did it and work towards change, less strenuous issues will arise. Progress, no matter how small, is HUGE. Something like this might look like: having a little itinerary or lists app on your phone (maybe one that you can share data with your wife on) so that if little changes occur like this, you can change/update it. Something like this can really help with both scenarios because a) you can still feel like you\u2019re in control of the situation(s) at hand, while still being \u201cin the zone\u201d to get things done, but b) your wife can also be prepared and in the loop for what is going on/any minor changes. We all work a little differently up there and it\u2019s up to us and only us to change certain scenarios in our lives that better suit our needs.\n\nLastly, I will say, make sure you get your wife some flowers\u2014or if she\u2019s not a flower gal, then something you know she would like. It doesn\u2019t have to be insanely expensive, but it might help kickstart a conversation. Wishing you the best. <3", "This is one of those things that happens and is annoying at the time.

Consider this a lesson about parenthood, too. \nYou can\u2019t just run, even in an \u201cemergency\u201d (which this was not), without checking on your family.\n\nYou screwed up and owe your wife a huge apology", "Going against the censur here. NTA\n\nOnly real issue is you guys not having 1 suitcase. Wtf bro. My wife and I traveled the world with a small suitcase and 2 normal sized backpacks and my wife likes to dress up etc so she had a handful outfits multiple shoes etc. And you two packed so much for a small holiday to the coast (which means a few tshirts shorts and swimming gear and a few dresses) and you guys packed your whole closet LOL.\n\nBut what you did was fine and makes sense. Your wife expected you to solo carry all that stuff makes her an asshole unless you are Mr Olympia 2023 ofc. \n\nHer overreaction is also idiotic lol \n\n\nBest course of action; wait a bit and then apologise, if shes sane she will do so aswell.", "YTA. \n\nDumb moment? Yes. Forgivable? Probably.\n\nBut you left behind your wife - your spouse, your life partner - for what is a minor and very common inconvenience. People miss their stops all the time, and the more measured approach is to get off at the next convenient stop and figure it out from there. Cabs probably exist wherever you were going.\n\nThis becomes a concern when this is all it takes for you to panic and leave her and your unborn child behind. What would you have done if there was smoke and fire, or a serious emergency?", "I've seen some of the comments, and as a fellow autistic I get the panic and how it happened. Rushing it and creating the chaos that ended up with her left on the train. You were quick and efficient on your end because you had all the context of what needed to be done, while she was trying to catch up and understand what was happening and why it was so urgent. YTA in that regard, and she is probably worrying about how the panic will affect you as a parent down the line. \n\nI will say for the people asking questions in the comments, and then calling OPs answers excuses: that is a thing a lot of autistics genuinely struggle with. Knowing when its a genuine question where your answer will be seen as an explanation or added context, and when it is not and trying to explain will come across as an excuse. I'm high masking with fairly low support needs, and I still have no idea how to know which questions actually wants explanations, and which ones doesnt. When I've asked people to please help me understand so I can know which is which, I've mostly just been told that its obvious, that I'm playing dumb, that I'm an idiot that needs to try harder, and that I should just know, so its unfortunately a bit hard to crack that particulare social nut for a lot of us.", "YTA. For not making sure your pregnant wife was with you. \n\nChill bro, you\u2019re supposed to be on holiday. Never understand why people go into a state of panic over shit like this as if the train is going to explode at the next stop. \n\nJust laugh or roll your eyes or say \u201ctypical\u201d or something, get off at the next stop and get a fucking Uber.", "YTA. if you did this to your pregnant wife, I wonder what you're going to do when you're travelling with a toddler or a child and they can't keep up either.\n\nIf I was your wife I would have cancelled the vacation too.", "YTA. How do you feel like you are in the right? You realize that you getting off and then getting the next train so you can meet is not a good outcome, so what you have done did not work out for the best. Unless you are claiming it is your pregnant wifes fault for not getting up faster with a heavy suitcase, you should be apologising.", "Wow, you really just got up and dipped without even making sure she was right behind you? Wtf, man, yes, YTA. 1000% Yes. \n\nYour wife is pregnant, and you both have luggage to carry. You absolutely should have stayed by her side instead of inducing panic and then using your autism as a way to justify what you did. You have a baby coming. You need to get some help for your \"induced panic\" (or whatever you called it) because this is absolutely not okay behavior from a grown ass man.\n\nEta: I see you say you're shocked she canceled. I am not, and I don't blame her! I, too, would've canceled the holiday", "YTA. You did abandon your pregnant wife. You are almost 30 years old you need to get a grip on your shit.  Stop using \"but I'm autistic\" as an excuse because it isn't. So what happens when your wife goes into labor? Are you going to panic and run to the car and drive to the hospital and leave her at home because you're stressed?  When the baby or kid gets hurt are you gonna run away? \n\nWhat if your wife is out and you're home with the baby and something happens? Drop the kid and bolt? \n\nYou could have:\n\nCalmly explained to your wife and gotten the bags together so you could both get off the train and she wasn't struggling with the luggage\n\nDiscussed options before running off the train\n\nSpoke to someone on the train to see if there was an alternate route they were taking or could recommend\n\n\nThe train was diverted. It wasn't going to explode. You didn't have an important meeting time you were going to miss. I sincerely hope your wife has other supports in her life than you because when shit gets real you'll be gone.", "NTA, just poor judgement \ud83d\ude05 you should definitely not have panicked like that and have been more mindful, but it sounds like an honest mistake.\n\nAlso, his wife is pregnant and not disabled!\nShe can handle riding a train alone for one station and take care of one suitcase (imagine pregnant women all over the world even travel ALONE and without being babysat every single day\ud83d\ude44).\n She has every right to be annoyed (I would be too, even in a non-pregnant state), but that doesn't automatically make him an asshole. This will be a funny story for you two to tell one day", "I'll prob get down voted but NTA. You didn't do anything with malicious intent. Does it sound like you over packed with too many bags? Yes. Did you abandon your wife? No. You told her you guys needed to deboard to get to where you're going. She was just a bit too slow, probably bc she's pregnant. You called her right away, made a plan. I think she sounds very dramatic to describe what happened as being abandoned, because she wasn't. She just didn't manage to make it off the train in time. That is what happened. Of course hormones come into play here. \n\nIt sounds like it was just an accident in a chaotic time. Of course it makes sense you want to deboard to make it to where you're going. Your wife just didn't share your same urgency and there was limited time to deboard.", "NTA, you just made a mistake. People seem to be missing the part where you clearly told your wife that you guys had to get off. You didn't just leave. In your panic you didn't realize she wasn't keeping up until it was too late.\n\nI feel like literally nobody here has been on a train before. Have you seen how fast some stops are? Train halts, doors open for like five seconds, doors close.\n\nIt was a complex situation in a short time. People need to have more empathy for you.\n\nDefinitely apologize to your wife though.", "Your wife is mad because she wasn't your priority in what seemed, at the time, as an emergency. Your instinct was to take care of yourself first rather than the woman you supposedly love, the woman carrying your future child. That instinct shows her that she can't rely on you. And she already tied her life to yours. So it's completely understandable that she cancelled a long planned vacation.", "What if she had a small kid with her!? Would OP leave abandoned then both!!", "YTA!!! You flipped out about a train being diverted.  Your wife is not as nimble as you. Your primary responsibility was to ensure she was with you.  Think about how\u2019d you\u2019d feel if she had gotten hurt heaving a heavy suitcase just to follow you. She could have fallen or worse.\n\nIf my husband acted like thatI I would have canceled.  You\u2019re a callous man!", "YTA. It\u2019s a train stop, a bomb wasn\u2019t going off. You didn\u2019t even check to make sure your pregnant wife had safely gotten off the train, you just grabbed your shit and ran. \nIf you panic over something as minor and ridiculous as this then I\u2019d be having second thoughts too. You owe her a huge apology.", "YTA--- You Panicked...and then jumped right up without looking back to see if she was with you? It goes to show how you would act in a crisis....just think about your self.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t do it deliberately. She\u2019s totally overreacted. Being 5 months pregnant slows women down alright, but doesn\u2019t make them incapable", "I'm going to say NAH. I've been in this exact scenario before. Your lizard brain made your decision to leave the train without checking on the wife, but you offered a very sensible solution which wouldn't have left her by herself for a large period of time.\n\nShe's also allowed to feel irate about the situation, as you acted before thinking. I feel she may have overreacted a little, but hey, I don't know your relationship dynamic.\n\nI'm sure you'll both be laughing about it next week.", "YTA you always makes sure you're together before just going. YTA dude", "I totally get the panic rush in a situation like that, but bro, you can't rush a pregnant woman like that lol otherwise you get stuck in a situation like this.\n\nAlso, way too much luggage!\n\nYTA", "Obviously YTA, come on bro, you know you done wrong", "YTA even in your situation I would have never left my wife pregnant or not we stay together either we both calmly got off together or we both wait and as an autistic person I get so tired of people blaming AH things they do on their autism", "YTA even more so for trying to blame it on your autism.", "You are the asshole . The train company would of gotten you to your place. You panicked really  badly. Just wow !", "YTA. You abandoned ship, basically,  without a care for your heavily pregnant wife? \n\nYou know that saying, women and children first? This is why. Unless you're in a war zone and you have to bodily shield her from sniper fire, it's ladies first in this case. \n\nBuddy. Buddy. You deserve every second you'll spend in the dog house for this. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "YTA. Autism or panic attack or whatever, now that you are married and soon to be a parent, you are now a *team* with your wife. You must make decisions together and get feedback from each other. Please take this as a learning experience and grow from this, don\u2019t just act on fear/instinct/panic\u2014and if you do, take the heavier suitcase!", "YTA - she\u2019s pregnant, of course she can\u2019t rush off like you can. You should have helped her", "YTA. You left her on the train, I don't see anyway to make that look good.", "YTA. Your wife got a glimpse of what life is going to look like with you as a \u201cflustered\u201d father and probably just wanted to go home and cope.", "YTA. You what. Way to play it cool in the face of a minor inconvenience. Good on you for showing your wife that you won\u2019t think about her for a second if you have to act fast.", ">I panicked and told my wife we had to get off or we weren\u2019t going to be able to get where we needed.\n\nUnless that train was being diverted 500 miles away, you would have gotten where you needed to be easily, even if you stayed on for an extra stop. You could have then checked other trains or options on your phone, discussed, and alighted the train calmly, and most importantly, together. \n\nYTA\n\nEdited to add - you used the term holiday instead of vacation, are you in the UK? If so, when trains divert or have to skip a stop, the train manager will more often than not, provide options for the affected passengers. Happened to me 2 weeks ago.", "YTA!\n\nShe\u2019s 5 months pregnant. You left her with a heavy suitcase. She can\u2019t move quickly as it is and give her oversized luggage and a wonky gait from growing a human being and this is a recipe for disaster. She can\u2019t move fast, she likely shouldn\u2019t lift the suitcase, and she\u2019s been given seconds it sounds like to completely change course. \n\nTake this as a lesson and get your shit together before this baby gets here because you sound like you\u2019re going to be a selfish asshole then too.\n\nEdit: typo", "How is this even a question? \n\nYTA. \n\nThere was NO real reason for you to have to just jump off the train at that exact station and especially without making sure that your wife got off with you. Of course your wife can't just jump off with you at 5 months pregnant. \n\nThere was no need to jump off in such a mad rush, so the train was being diverted...it's a freaking adventure just get off the train when you can that is a reasonable time. \n\nNow your wife is stuck having to try to get off the train at another station without you. \n\nIt's not even a panic worthy moment. To me it sounded like a fun adventure, and then you ruined it by becoming so 'paniced' by leaving your pregnant wife on the train.", "YTA. Could you put a little effort into being considerate? \u201cPregnancy is difficult on the body, so pregnant people often need more care or assistance\u201d is not a difficult concept, especially *five months in,* where your wife has definitely been feeling the changes in her body.", "YTA for \u201cI felt I was in the right.\u201d The best you can hope for is excusing it as a panic-induced screwup on your part. Insisting that you were *right* to do what you did essentially blames your 5mo pregnant wife for not moving fast enough.", "YTA - dont panic over something so irrelevant. If that happens it happens but how do you manage to jump off and dont even look if your wife is with you?! Like how is this even a question to you if you are in the wrong here?? \n\nYou: \n\n- panicked over nothing\n- create stress for your PREGNANT wife\n- rushed out WITHOUT your PREGNANT wife \n- did not look or take care for your PREGNANT wife in this situation at all\n- still don\u2019t see how what you did was wrong\n- still don\u2019t see how what you did was wrong after your entire family told you it was wrong \n- come here in hopes of someone telling you you where right so you can keep to tell yourself you did nothing wrong\n\nDude you will have to raise kids with your wife snap out of this BS and try to become a more caring husband like seriously what kind of joke is this?", "NAH; it was an honest mistake.", "NTA but you didn't think this one through.", "NTA.

You didn\u2019t stop to think or talk things through with your wife even once before you abandoned the train (and her) like it was on fire. \n\nShe overreacted by wanting to cancel the vacation, but you definitely do deserve her being upset with you.", "YTA. Fucking Christ on a bicycle dude, how can you grab two bags and not have a second to think that, maybe, your PREGNANT WIFE would need help getting the third case down?", "YTA ,that would have stressed me out so much.

At 39, you've never experienced a disruption of your plans before? If she had no trouble getting off at the next stop then what the hell was the big deal? Of course she is mad and probably embarrassed as heck. How are you supposed to raise a kid together if you can't even travel by train together? There is this thing called communication. Look it up, it's an amazing tool. People that partner up use it to make sure everyone is on the same page. It makes life a lot easier and also helps you from looking like an idiot. Learn from this experience and go apologize to her and her whole family. It might take more than words to get you out of the doghouse. But if you put just half of the gusto you had rushing out of a train for no reason..into making up with her, you should be fine.", "Mostly dumb but YTA for still thinking this was an appropriate reaction.", "YTA.\n\nIt's just a train stop.  No need to panic.  OP needs to take a beat here and do some self-reflection.  It's his job to take care of his wife and child.  How would he react in a real crisis?\n\nSounds like they over packed, quite a bit.  When you're traveling (especially by train) you need to account for traveling with your luggage.

Would you only check on them when you've reached safety", "YTA. Hugely. I would be livid. Pregnant or not.

Learn a lesson, the person who has greater need, in this case your pregnant wife, should be the one dictating the pace of change, with you supporting. You should have let her get off, and gotten all the luggage off. Also, why do y\u2019all need so much luggage? \n\nNote on the greater need, this includes you being aware of your autism and your wife being aware of signs things are kicking up.  Sounds like you panicked at the diversion, and focused on what you needed to do at the expense of what WE need to do.", "YTA you left a pregnant woman on a train because you panicked and ran? Why was she not as important to get as a suitcase? You seemed more worried about the luggage than her. 7 month pregnant woman aren't know for their speed and agility.

It would have been better to stick together and be a considerate of her speed and mobility.", "YTA.  Make sure your party is together.  You're like the husband in Force Majeure. \ud83d\ude02", "YTA. 1) Your response was immature. Chill, the train isn't going to Antarctica.

You didn't do it on purpose, and if your wife wasn't pregnant, I think she was overreacting a bit.\n\nBut you got off the train in a panic. Your wife I'd pregnant so she can't do things that quickly. Before you get off, you always check if the other person is behind you. No matter if they're pregnant or not. But this has probably caused her a lot of stress, being left behind in a train in a strange city or country. I would panic from that as well. \n\nSo you should always check where your wife is.

Your wife goes first, ahead of you and you help her. It\u2019s basic common sense.", "Yta and you father in law is right", "YTA but low key I guess.  Stupid for panicking, you could have just looped back like her.

You did something silly and thoughtless because you panicked. That doesn't make you an AH, but disliking it doesn't make your wife one either.

She's pregnant, not wheelchair bound. I think YTA is way too harsh for something you did not intentionally do.", "Ehhh NTA because it seems like a genuine mistake while panicked and that you really tried to make up in the moment, but also I think it\u2019s fair that your wife is upset. It was a serious of dumb calls you made that got both of you in this mess.

Like how do you just peace out without stopping for even a brief moment to look back at the person you're with?", "Also, at 5 months pregnant, grabbing heavy or bulky things can sometimes already be getting harder depending on how quickly/how much your stomach expands", "Total Bachelor move, OP forgot he was married with (unborn) children.", "I find it a tad disturbing that his panicking involved remembering two suitcases and forgetting his pregnant wife.\n\nLet's hope he doesn't forget her when she goes into labor and he rushes out the door to the car with her emergency baby bag.", "It's so weird though. The train is being diverted and the announcement wasn't \"we're changing routing in the next stop is into an active volcano\". It's a train, they're terrestrial, stations are generally minutes apart. What is panic inducing about this?", "This is one of those situations where it\u2019s not just about this one little incident.\n\nAnd if this happened at the very beginning of a trip where the work and labor of navigating two people and three suitcases was going to happen often, as it does on a trip, the wife probably just didn\u2019t feel like signing on for that.\n\nA 39 year old human should be able to manage the small difficulties in life better than that. And if I were depending upon that person in any fashion, as a pregnant woman is, I\u2019d be pissed and scared.", "I agree, but he's still an AH for making a split second decision and then getting mad because his pregnant wife wasn't running after him full speed. He should have stayed on the train so they could both discuss the best course of action.", "She may have overreacted in the moment. But I bet this really dredged up a lot of shit for her, considering he's the partner she's gonna raise a tiny human with. She got in her feels. She's questioning how he'll act in an emergency. \n\nHis defensiveness is bad, it snowballs everything.", "If you can grant clemency to OP for being in panic mode I think you can grant clemency to a pregnant wife with pregnancy hormones.", "He left his pregnant wife alone on a train. If he was panicking he should've been panicking to get them off the train, not just to hop off and hope she did the same.", "Even if it was an accident he left his pregnant wife on a train and still claims he did the right thing, and what was the wife supposed to say when the family asked her how the vacation was?", "Yeah, I've seen a lot of people do this though. Obviously the big backpack gets left in hostels/lockers and things and you have a smaller backpack fro your day trips, but travel days they end up looking like a wonky camel or something", "I'm not husband but I would pregnant my whole cancel.", "My mother miscarried my older brother because my Dad left her to move things around that she shouldn't have been trying to lift...so there's that too.", "This. Currently 36 weeks (about 8 months) and my fianc\u00e9 would do the opposite. He'd stay there until I was able to move with him. Yknow, because he feels like he needs to protect his future spouse who's carrying his child. He wouldn't even dream of jumping ship (or train, literally) when a problem arises. \n\nImagine how crap her birth will be if he doesn't get his shit together.", "Better ask the Luigi board for help.", "You might enjoy Downhill (2020 film) with Will Ferrell and Julia Louise Dreyfus. It's a black comedy about a guy who grabs his cell phone and runs as an avalanche is coming, leaving his wife and children behind. They are all safe and the rest of the movie is how the family deals in the aftermath. Has a great twist ending.", "That totally reminds me of the post where a woman and her bf were mugged and he BOLTED and left her alone with the mugger. She had nothing to steal and luckily the mugger didn\u2019t want anything else so let her unharmed. \n\nShe went and found the police etc. Later he tried telling her he\u2019d run for the police, but they\u2019d only been atone the corner and he clearly didn\u2019t talk to them, then he told her she was supposed to run too\u2026 \n\nGuys like this absolutely exist.", "George Constanza vibes.", "Plot twist: OP is George Costanza!", "Why not make sure your wife gets off before you lol", "He didn't really have a good reason to think that though.", "He should have made sure she was in front of him. You don't jump off a train then look back wondering where your pregnant wife is! \n\nIs this a generational thing?", "I'm cancelled so I can't trip the whole husband.", "Honestly, if I was 5 months pregnant and this happen I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be in a state of mind to feel comfortable continuing traveling with him. He didn\u2019t just jump off the train. He jumped off the train leaving his pregnant wife struggling with a large piece of heavy luggage. This was just a \u201cwe have to figure out a new route\u201d & he was so freaked out that he acted so fast without a moment of thought leaving her. Imagine if there was a real emergency. How can she count on him if she suddenly needs medical assistance?", "I absolutely get what you're saying, and it's not an excuse, but let's not forget she's pregnant. Those hormones are absolutely crazy. When I got pregnant I think I got upset we didn't have the \"right brand\" of yogurt. \n\nPregnancy hormones aside, he didn't really prove he can 1) think on his feet in an \"emergency\" or 2) accurately judge what an emergency is..", "No it's not. \n\nEver been pregnant? Being pregnant is scary. You are vulnerable because your body isn't yours any more. It's heavy and unwieldy and you can't move around like you are used to.\n\nI guarantee you she was thinking in that moment, \"OMG is the father of my child an idiot? He has to know I can't move as fast as him! What if the baby were here? Would he just abandon the baby on a train because he panicked? OMG... he would!\"\n\nIf I were the wife, I'd be livid too, because he'd have made it clear in that moment that I'm having a baby with an idiot.", "This. Did he goof up in the heat of the moment? Yeah. But it's not really a big deal, just a funny story to tease him about later.", "It\u2019s based on the Swedish film *Force* *Majeure*, which is fantastic as well.", "Without training people do absolutely unfathomable things in a crisis, things that don't necessarily reflect their morals, ideals or how they would consciously choose to behave. \n\nSometimes they panic and do nothing, other times they run, sometimes they take a crazy course of action. This is why in places like the military where you are expected to be in high stress situations they train so much. Once panic sets in there's really no telling what a person (or you) will do.\n\nOP and the guy you're referencing are assholes for attempting to rationalize their decision making process rather than just admit they panicked and did a stupid shitty thing as a result.", "Exactly. She's 5 mo preggers--it's an awkward time (and it's going to become even more so) and sometimes you just can't move that fast. He needs to get that panic mode crap under control, this was a totally preventable issue.", "My bf is 5 years younger than me and always makes sure I lead the way through exits or what ever. It\u2019s polite", "Or like\u2026 get all three suitcases down so she could more easily manage the one instead of grabbing two and just making a run for it? I\u2019m probably imagining this totally incorrectly but it just feels like he hopped up, snagged the suitcases, and bolted", "I'm whole but I would have gotten trip.", "Right. And now instead of having thought things through a little more calmly, now they are on different train platforms, having to figure out different routes on top of getting back together again. It sounds exhausting.", "Well, it wouldn't be a big deal if he just apologized and acknowledged that he was in the wrong instead of blaming her for being slow.\n\nOP showed her that he does not automatically operate as a team and a partner, he just thought about himself and not that she was there not only carrying the only carry-on luggage but also his unborn child while he wheeled two suitcases out. \n\nHe left her with the burdens and then acts like she was the slow one, that's the real problem here, the attitude.", "Yeah this whole thing in and of itself is a small problem. But his opinion that he felt he was in the right for that behavior....That's much more worrysome.", "Is he going to panic when wife goes into labor?", "Absolutely, chivalry isn't dead. This OP's a numb nuts.", "I'm trip but would gotten I.", "Not only that, but being pregnant can feel very vulnerable for a lot of women. Homicide is literally the leading cause of death for pregnant women in the US - even more likely than dying from birthing complications. She had a right to be upset, she had a right to seek support from her family, and she had a right to not be in the mood to continue the vacation.", "What's he going to do once they have kids? \ud83d\ude2c You have to be able to handle chaos!", ">\tOP showed her that he does not automatically operate as a team and a partner\n\nThis is why I\u2019d be pissed. Also, I would venture to guess that he probably does shit like this fairly often. And I get being a panicky idiot, really. We\u2019re all human and it happens, but it gets really fucking old when your partner is constantly going into \u201conly thinking about themself\u201d panic mode over stupid shit. \n\nThis is the type of dude that panics and rushes to the hospital without her when she goes into labor. Did he mean to? No, but I would still be crushed. Just because the intentions aren\u2019t bad doesn\u2019t mean that it isn\u2019t still a shitty thing to do.", "My mother was very much like OP when I was young. She was hyper anxious, made terrible decisions based on her anxiety, *always tried to justify her bad decisions*, and never apologized for her mistakes. She's grown so much in the last decade. That being said, I was left for hours alone on a public beach when I was 5, one of my older sisters was left at a grocery store an hour away from home, we often missed important things..... The important part isn't acknowledging OPs anxiety here, it's acknowledging that OPs anxiety has had a detrimental affect on another person. An apology would serve him well!", "It's not small. It DEFINITELY shows how he may act in an emergency situation. \n\nAnd I won't entertain any opposition to this---that's a psychological truth. He's not ready for an emergency situation. They require SO MUCH script-practice ahead of time. \n\nAnyone who doesn't believe me about this should read The Unthinkable by Amanda Ripley."]}
