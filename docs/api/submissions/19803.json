I\u2019m 29 and my wife is 25. She\u2019s also five months pregnant. Recently we decided to go on holiday together - nothing fancy, just to the coast, which meant we had to get a train. We had maybe three rolling suitcases, and one of those army-style backpacks. \n\nThere was no issue as we boarded the train, and we sat down and put the luggage next to us. About twenty minutes into our journey, we heard an announcement over the speakers that the train was being diverted, which meant it wasn\u2019t going to stop at the station we needed anymore. As it was saying this, the train was coming to a stop at the next station. \n\nI panicked and told my wife we had to get off or we weren\u2019t going to be able to get where we needed. I got up and started grabbing our things, and rushed off the train. I couldn\u2019t believe it when I looked round and saw she hadn\u2019t gotten off - she was trying to grab our third suitcase (I had the other two and the backpack). Unfortunately it was too late, and even as I rushed to the doors, they closed. My wife looked like she wanted to kill me, and the train pulled away with her on it.\n\nI called her to tell her to get off at the next stop and I\u2019d get the next one and meet her, but she was absolutely irate and told me the holiday was cancelled and she was going home. To top it off, she told her family and mine and they\u2019re all furious at me for \u201cabandoning\u201d a pregnant woman on a train \u201cheaded God knows where\u201d with a heavy suitcase.

Why panick over something so little, you could have just stayed on the train and discussed with your wife what you guys were gonna do.   \nYou sound like one of those people that would reverse on the highway because you took the wrong exit, instead of just taking the safer but longer way around.", "YTA\n\nYou panicked and acted very rashly. You didn\u2019t ask her if you, as a couple, should get off. You didn\u2019t make sure your pregnant wife was able to keep up. Very inconsiderate all around. \n\nYou could have asked her what she felt like doing. You could have been chivalrous and had her get off first, or at least stand in the door to make sure it doesn\u2019t close before she could disembark. \n\nStop putting the word abandoning in quotation marks as if that isn\u2019t exactly what you did.", "YTA.\n\nYou should\u2019ve figured that your *pregnant wife* may not be as nimble as you are. I can\u2019t imagine not taking the time to make sure she\u2019s with you, or at least impeding the train doors, something to that effect (easier said than done, depending on the railroad, in fairness). \n\nYour wife overreacted IMO by cancelling the entire vacation, but you definitely screwed up. I don\u2019t see how, even with this being a total accident, you feel \u201cin the right\u201d here.", "YTA\n\nIn such a case sticking together is more important than getting out at the right stop. You should have made sure she was right behind you when getting out especially when she had to wrangle a heavy suitcase while pregnant. Which she shouldn't be doing at all by the way, it is against medical advice for pregnant women to carry heavy things. Her health and the health of your unborn child matter more than getting out the train.", "YTA you chose the most impractical way to travel with 3 suitcases and a bag, and left her with the heaviest one. You should know that your wife isn\u2019t as nimble as you. And why were you panicking? You walked to the other stop just as fine so why not talk to your wife and find a new game plan? There was no need to panic in such a way that you did. You say it\u2019s your autism but I don\u2019t believe autism causes this kind of behaviour (although if I\u2019m wrong someone please correct me). \n\nPerhaps cancelling the holiday was far or telling your family but you did leave her on a train.", "YTA Why did your pregnant wife have to carry the heavy suitcase? Why carry four pieces of luggage on a not so fancy holiday while traveling with a pregnant person, by train? Why didn\u2019t you leave the train together?

Entirely.\n\nThe dilligence youve been given is due.", "Lmao so YOU absolutely had to get off at that stop no matter what, but it was fine for your pregnant wife to get off at the next stop and circle back? And you still feel like you were in the right? No dude. You treated her in a totally cold and uncaring way. If you had done it in a moment of panic and later regretted it that might be one thing, but doubling down on it now in the cold light of day makes you MASSIVELY YTA.", "YTA because you just left her there??? You didn\u2019t stop to check if she was exiting! Also why three suitcases? You said it was \u2018just to the coast\u2019 which is probably a week or less.", "YTA. It's better to make sure you both look out for each other than get off at the right stop. I know anxiety with sudden train changes can cloud judgement, but please keep this in mind if this happens again.", "YTA. Dude. You panicked over a train stop and left your very pregnant wife behind\u2026.

You were very, very wrong.", "YTA\n\nI understand you wanting to get off, but panicking and rushing off the train to the point you don't pay attention to your wife? Where exactly was the third suitcase that your (5 months pregnant) wife was still trying to grab it? Overhead storage or something? You should have helped her get the third suitcase from wherever and allowed her to get off first.", "YTA.  As all your family already say.  All you thought about was yourself and your agenda.  Next you\u2019ll be leaving kids behind because you get flustered.  Your poor wife.", "YTA. It wasn't really worth the panic. You could have gotten off at the diverted stop and used that time to discuss your plans. Instead you created a bit of a frenzy and didn't ensure she was able to get off in time.", "I don\u2019t want to fully say YTA, it\u2019s more like you\u2019re the dum-dum. You didn\u2019t mean to abandon her and it was obviously a mistake, not malicious. You panicked and had a dum-dum moment. Take this as a learning opportunity. Your wife may not be able to keep up with you while she\u2019s pregnant, and it doesn\u2019t stop there! Your new baby won\u2019t be able to keep up with you either. You\u2019ll have to adjust and learn to wait up for others once you\u2019re a dad.", "YTA\n\nin panic mode you can\u2018t just think about yourself. You have to check if the person in need/with you has understood the issue and if they are following.\n\nIf your panic response doesn\u2018t improve and change asap you\u2018re not fit to be left alone with a baby.\n\nAnd that\u2018s probably what she understood and why she\u2018s so furious. She sees you as someone who\u2018ll abandon the family when in panic instead of sticking together and planing together. \n\nLittle incidents like this will show how you\u2018ll react with bigger/other issues. It\u2018s something like an eyes-opening event.\n\nIf you were just the two of you, fine, she can deal even if it was a stupid move, but her mind is already set on family and future and therefor has to picture how it\u2018s gonna be with a little helpless being around you.", "Oh boy. YTA. You shouldn't have gotten off without checking she was right behind you. The panic was unnecessary. You'd have been fine at the other stop.", "YTA. You panicked about something little in comparison to the outcome that you got. And i dont get it, you could just make sure that she was out and then you or just go down on the other station and take a taxi or something to go where you originally wanted.", "You were in the right? How? My guy, have you lost your mind? YTA", "YTA. You should have made sure she got off first. Pregnancy makes us slower, and it\u2019s hard to bend over. Wherever she was grabbing the third suitcase from seemed like it took her longer. You could have talked to the conductor. Either way you were literally only focused on you and not your wife. Just apologize.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019d be the asshole if she wasn\u2019t pregnant, your definitely the asshole as she is.", "On trains,planes or in house fires the first rule is always 'rescue the spouse and kids'.

That doesn't mean it wasn't AH behavior even if it wasn't intentional, and now you are in a calmer place you can think through how it feels from someone elses perspective.\n\nYou panicked, reacted, that was bad.  Be sorry for it.  But, she is 5 months pregnant, going through all sorts of changes in her body.   She may have experienced  exactly the same sort of irrational feelings you did that caused you to panic.   Why would you get a pass for that and she doesn't get one when she is literally carrying your baby?

Hopefully you can talk it over once things calm down a bit.", "Please start working on you panicking over trivial things as fast as possible. My mom was like that.

Absolutely.", "YTA", "I wouldn\u2019t call you an asshole, rather an idiot", "YTA - staying on with her, overshooting and figuring out a joint plan would have been rational rather than running off and leaving her.", "I wouldn't say YTA because it was an accident and you didn't do it on purpose. However I will say that you were ignorant in the situation and next time you should probably try to be a little bit more aware of your surroundings.", "You're right, the title does sound crazy. \n\nNot gonna say YTA though.  Should have probably stayed on the train and asked the conductor what was going to be done about people needing to get to your stop.

You could have hustled to the exit area but ensured she was right there with you before stepping off. That way even if you missed the stop, you'd have been together.\n\nAccidental, obviously, but mostly down to being a bit thoughtless and oblivious.\n\nBut your wife's reaction also seems a bit OTT given that it was still an accident.

Being 5 months pregnant is not the handicap most here are insinuating. My gosh even 9 months pregnant one could handle a suitcase. She overreacted.  Sorry your vacation was canceled. Maybe this was a final straw in a list of many things that upset her though. That\u2019s the only thing I can imagine.", "Going against the grain but NTA.

What will you do if you lose control of the pram? What if a cat comes towards you on the footpath? What if the baby falls off the changing table? What if they're choking on something? What if your wife faints while she's pregnant?\n\nThe way I handle these things to avoid analysis paralysis is I choose a top priority. For example, under any circumstances that are dangerous, my most important task is to get my child in my arms and out of the way. Then I think through the scenarios in which that wouldn't be good and plan the exceptions, e.g. if I'm dizzy (get on the floor then grab the kid), if the danger is only directed at me (get myself out of the way then grab the kid), if my kid has hurt himself in a way that might cause Slovak injury (comfort him without moving him until injuries are clear). \n\nStaying in close proximity to a vulnerable family member is usually the best course of action, even if it causes other issues. You learned that in this situation. So gentle yta cause you should know this about yourself and have prepared mentally for how to handle anything that feels like an emergency when you're with your pregnant wife.

I've never once lost him, which I can't say for any of my other parent friends. You can handle this but you need to do it differently than allistic people.

Can\u2019t imagine this much luggage for a local weekend getaway??", "I took less luggage when I lived abroad for a year - I had 1 large suitcase and backpack.  Due to my disability I need a lot of stuff now, but that\u2019s one reason I just don\u2019t travel by train.", "No, she was pregnant and trying to stand up whilst also processing why the hell you jumped out of your seat and ran off the train without saying anything to her or waiting for her", "Men need to stop calling pregnant women who have all the right to be absolutely pissed about a situation, hormonal! She was pissed at you with a reason! Just leave the hormones out of it and look in mirror.", "Maybe it's not the hormones, but the thought that her partner, who she has chosen to make a child with, would abandon her (and possibly the child) in a far more serious situation sometime down the line. That would at least cross my mind. YTA", "Well said \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", "Panic or not still an AH move", "How are they still insisting they\u2019re right? They were simply answering the question they were asked.", "Not at all, I\u2019m just giving some more context because I thought it would be useful", "Absolutely", "I'm autistic and absolutely hate how people use it to excuse unacceptable behavior. Yes I think a little differently but that just means I have to work a little harder to make sure I'm not an AH like OP. OP YTA and get it together and quit using autism as an excuse before the baby is born. The why doesn't matter, the actions do. You left your pregnant wife struggling with heavy luggage on a train because you were worried you might be inconvenienced. You still haven't apologized to her which is probably why she told others about your behavior and lack of manners. Do better.", "I can't stand when people use their autism as an excuse to be AHs. Especially when said people know they behave a certain way. If you know do something about it. \n\nAs others said - it's an explanation but no excuse.", "I know, I\u2019m just trying to provide some additional information about me", "I never meant it to come across that way", "If you think that it's okay for him to act erratic because autism, but not okay for her to act volatile when she's pregnant,  that's a huge double standard.", "Not to mention this situation was entirely caused by OP's emotions getting the better of him, but sure, it's *her* hormones that are the problem. \ud83d\ude44", "OP says it in the post.\n\n>I feel like I was in the right, but my wife and family have other ideas.", "They didn't actually answer the question", "It's not useful context,  because you seem to think that it absolves you. It's an explanation, but it's not an excuse.", "Why are people downvoting this? He's agreeing that he needs to work on it. Turn off the attack mode, mobsters...", "Doesn't really matter. I say this as someone on the spectrum. \n\n>it manifests in a bit of a control freak personality trait and I think that\u2019s why I panicked like I did\n\nYou know that you have an issue. You know that being a control freak isn't great. \n\nInfo: What are you doing to work on this behavior?\n\nEdit: what is your plan for when you kid is born? What if you panic when you're outside with your child?", "I don't care how you meant it. I care about what you did.", "He has a disability, she has no such excuse", "That was them saying they were right the first time. Not still insisting. Still insisting would be if they\u2019d said it again in the comment you were replying to. If that\u2019s not the case why did you say it to that comment?", "They did. They were asked why they panicked over it and they answered it was because of their autism.", "I don\u2019t at all think it absolves me. I\u2019m just trying to explain what makes me sometimes panic, but I accept that it doesn\u2019t explain why I did what I did", "It might explain his original panic, but it *doesn't* justify him doubling down and insisting he did nothing wrong.", "Have you been pregnant? I promise you if my husband had dinner this when I was pregnant I would have done the same. Not only that but what will he do when the baby is born. Those things are probably going through her head would he have left his child?", "I'm not going to do it,  I'm just curious: how far into your post history would I need to go to find you posting in childfree or one of the other subs that hate on pregnant women or people with children?", "\"Still insisting\" means \"still insisting after the original incident.\" Hope that helps.", "Then why are you on AITA trying to get people to absolve you, and trying to explain away your behavior? You know you were a jerk to her, you know why.  Accept you were a jerk, apologize and be better.", "If you don\u2019t think it absolves you, why do you think you\u2019re in the right?  Absent the excuse of panicking, you would\u2019ve been clearly in the wrong for getting off the train without her, right?", "What happens when your kid is born? You're going to have to work on that, or your next post will be \"aita for leaving me kid on the train\"\n\nYTA", "It perfectly explains why you did what you did. It just doesn't excuse the action. Learn to manage better, right now your wife is the one who has to suffer when you react to situations with thoughtless panic instead of responding to situations together as a team", "It isn\u2019t that I\u2019m insisting I did nothing wrong at all, I\u2019m just looking for other people\u2019s perspectives on it.", "Not far", "Oh I see what you mean, thanks. To that point though, why were you asking that to this one of OP\u2019s comment?", "It isn\u2019t about asking anyone to absolve me - I\u2019m just asking for opinions on my actions and I\u2019m getting them", "\u201cI feel like I was in the right\u201d. Meaning you think you did nothing wrong", "Well so far it looks like you're spending more time explaining yourself than actually absorbing the feedback you're receiving."]}
