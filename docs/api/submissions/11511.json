Think exactly like that and then do exactly what you\u2019d advice your loved ones to do. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s hard to make decisions when we think of ourselves, so we gotta step out of our own shoes and look at the situation from afar. \n\nThe only reason you feel bad is because you love him, but that\u2019s not worth a preventable uti.

The longterm effects of this is too dangerous, I\u2019m telling you!", "Oh my goodness no please stop hurting yourself. \n\nThis is life threatening and the fact that its happend more than once and he hasnt changed any patterns\n.........he doesnt care about you. Plain and simple.\n\nPlease seek out therapy for yourself, because both putting yourself physically in harm's way as well as still having s%x while being grossed out is not normal. It's just not.", "It can also get worse....", "If that's the case,  I would tell him that he has to get outside help, because he's literally making you sick. You cannot do this alone, and obviously he can't either. \n\nYou need to put on your big girl pants and look at the situation he's put you in. Stop being obtuse about it.", "He works in food, he\u2019s a cook at a hibachi restaurant.", "Yeah I don\u2019t see this situation improving :/", "Oh sweet baby Jesus, he works in a RESTAURANT??\n\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\n\nNot to be crass, but if he\u2019s not washing his ass at home, he\u2019s most definitely not washing his hands at work.\n~sigh~\n\nUltimatums are whack, but you kinda don\u2019t have any other choice. Please OP, at the very least, do not sleep with this man again until he gets some help\u2026", "NTA. I'm so sorry for the loss of your baby but he isn't functioning. I only had to work with someone who didn't wash and it was disgusting, you are putting your health at risk with the UTIs he's been giving you. Personal hygiene is about respecting yourself but also about respecting those around you by not making them suffer your miasma. He doesn't respect you and you can't fix this.\n\nPlease, please, for your own mental and physical wellbeing, you need to cut your losses and walk out or kick him out. He's made it clear he's not willing to change.", "NTA holy shit dump him. Preferably into a bath.", "NTA\n\nSometimes we love someone dearly and want to help them getting the help they need. But that love isn't always enough when they refuse to get the help they so desperately need. \n\nIt affects him so much that he gave you several UTI's. That really crosses a line. He's jeopardizing your health at this point. Please think of yourself and what you need. You don't want to lose yourself trying to help someone who so clearly refuses to let anyone help him.", "Oh man. NTA. He needs professional help. I'm sorry I don't know how best to get him to cooperate with that.\n\nEdit: My partner and I used to bathe together quite regularly, wash each others hair etc. Could that be a thing to do, make getting clean together an intimate thing?", "Of course NTA. Wow, how is this even a thing? I don't give a fuck if he is depressed, wash your ass! Why are you with someone that is this unhealthy in mind and body. UTI's from having a dirty dick is unacceptable. You are young, get out now. He is 24, this should have been a non issue years ago. You are not his keeper. If he cant take care of himself, he will not take care of you.", "I'm wondering from a mental health point of view if I'm there is more to why he won't shower. I know someone who stopped because they were hearing voices while in the shower. He needs to be assessed by a professional as it could be linked with a fear, could be related to depression or something else.\n\nAlso withholding intimacy for your own health is normal as you can't afford to get sick and spend money on medication because he doesn't clean properly. Don't feel guilty about this. You need to look after you. \n\nYou can't change someone and this kind of thing takes time if it ever gets manage. Is up to you how long you stay for. Just remember any change needs to come from him", "You honestly need to take a break from him if he's giving you UTIs consistently. You will definitely pay for that later. If a man stinks and it's unbearable then lock up shop. All those bacteria and antibiotics won't be kind to your body as you age. I have plenty of guy friends and they would brag about how they told the woman that she stinks. More women need to start turning the tables.", "Also \u201con his game always and poor communication\u201d isn\u2019t just man stuff. It\u2019s bum stuff.", "You really aren\u2019t going to like what I have to say but I hope you listen. It\u2019s time to get him into a program. I had to do one a few years ago when I was just too stressed to care about anything. \n\nOne of the big things they talk about is when you are no longer able to do activities of daily living which includes hygiene. Once you\u2019ve reached that point, professionals and supervision need to be involved. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean he needs to be committed. There are different levels. I didn\u2019t stay overnight, I did a day program at the local behavioral health hospital from 8-5 and then graduated to just the morning program of 8-1. \n\nI went there for 6 weeks and it changed my life. I had the support of group therapy, a psychiatrist, and a social worker on top of the classes and other therapeutic activities. I was already going to a therapist, she\u2019s the one who raised the alarm to me that I was in serious trouble and needed more help. Thank god for her.", "*you cannot fix him*\n\nThat\u2019s not how these things work. Ever.\n\nHe has to have it within himself to seek help and take action \u2014 and that means therapy and hard work.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t do that\u2026 then you\u2019re not a terrible person for leaving him, even though you love him.", "If you stay with him, YTA. Can you imagine what will happen if you have a child? Hard choices need to be made.", "He\u2019s okay with your getting UTIs. He knows how you feel about his hygiene. Yet still refuses to change. Do you not see how one sided things are?", "That is usually part of the depression, but he may be needing both meds and therapy. NTA", "If you\u2019re not gonna listen to the suggestions then why post at all! Keep living in your infected bubble", "Ever seen Inside No.9? The first episode, Sardines?\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardines\\_(Inside\\_No.\\_9)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardines_(Inside_No._9))", "He cooks at a hibachi restaurant? Like the ones where the chef cooks in front of the customers? How is it even possible that the customers don't complain about the smell? I don't know if I can even believe any of this is real.", "Oh NO.", ">How is it even possible that the customers don't complain about the smell?\n\n...because there would be a bunch of other strong smells covering it up? \n\nThis doesn't seem dishonest at all. It makes sense that the smell of grilled meats, garlic, sauces etc would prevent customers on the other side of a counter from smelling him. His co-workers probably know he drinks but not the customers.\n\nI'm moreso wondering if this guy washes his hands. It's nasty for someone with poor hygiene to work with food.", "Yeah, you could be right about the other smells covering it up. \n\nBut just imagine all those smells clinging to him on top of his body odors. Poor OP. How did she manage to live with him for 2 years?"]}
