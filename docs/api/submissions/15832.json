The bus driver had turned around again by then, and both him and the old man had (what I perceived as, anyway) a portrait surprised pikachu face.

Even when we book cars for ourselves, we generally ask the driver if we can take a call/the driver asks if they can take a call. Though from what I understand he was cussing you out for speaking English, not for taking the call, right?

OP could have been using a perfectly respectable indoor voice. \n\n>By your own admission, there was room for you to move further away\n\nSo if OP was sitting with a friend and they decided to strike up a conversation, are you telling me you expect the both of them to move to another seat just so they can do so? And if there *was* no room to move, would you expect them to stay silent? \n\nI don't think you understand how being in public works. When you're in public, sometimes you have to deal with hearing the ppl around you talk to each other, either in person or on the phone. Unless the bus has a specific \"quiet zone\" rule or something, no one is required to be absolutely silent. Having a conversation falls under the reasonable allowance for making sounds-it's not comparable to blasting music or watching a youtube video or something.", "Point taken. It's interesting to read that it is culturally frowned upon to do many of the things that happen over here, over where you are (and possibly many other places as well).

So correct me if I\u2019m wrong that the talking on the phone thing isn\u2019t really a big cultural no-no in Uruguay. \n\nEven if it is, the old person was bigoted and xenophobic.

You were within your right to stand up for yourself and that man had no business policing what you were saying, and in what language it was in. Reminds me of a time I was studying abroad in France and was waiting in my airline gate to fly back to France after a weekend trip in Spain. Now, I'm not from France but I did speak French well enough (after studying it for 8+ years and at that point, living in France for several months.) I picked up a call from a friend who wanted to hear about my Spain trip and while I was speaking, this older French couple sitting near me at the gate started complaining and insulting me, saying crap like \"Oh, these annoying Americans think they can do whatever they want!\" (Speaking on the phone...?). They kept being rude and talking about my \"loud\" behavior. I promise you I was chill and quiet cause it was 8am. When I hung up, I turned to them and in French said \"Could you watch my backpack while I fill up my water, please?\" and I genuinely will never forget this couples' faces. The wife turned red while the husband awkwardly said \"Sure\". I walked away with a sense of pride tbh. Got my water and even thanked them when I returned to my seat. \n\nI learned two lessons that day. One: speaking multiple languages (even if you're not perfect) opens up your world and generally is awesome to know, and two: if you're going to talk about someone who can probably hear you, try to figure out if they would understand you. Cause let's be honest, I'm not perfect, I'll gossip with my mom in our language (my first language, not English) in public but we're careful not to piss anyone off just in case anyone hears us and understands us \ud83d\ude02\n\nAlso, I hate people like that man.
