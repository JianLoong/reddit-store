Onto the story. \n\nI (23M) was in the bus on my way to work, second front row right window. In front of me was an old man, probably low 70s, sitting on the aisle seat (window seat empty). I picked up a call from my contact in the US for advice on running a new ground for an aftermarket dash in his car. \n\nSo we're discussing some things related to it, and all of a sudden I hear the man in front start insulting very heavily, I believe with some comments about immigrants. Quite colorful, he was. I ignore it and continue talking away.. until the man turns around and insults me directly. He said -in Spanish- something along the lines of \"go talk like that elsewhere, son of a b\". The bus driver immediately turns around and yells \"calm down\" to the man. I give him a thumbs up and continue talking. The man does calm down.. for about 45 seconds. \n\nHe then turns around again and spits out something regarding deportation, followed by even more insults. I tell my contact \"there's someone cussing at me for speaking English, one moment\", then put the phone down, look at the man, and reply in perfect rioplatense Spanish (translated for the post): \"Gentleman, there's half a bus still empty; if you don't like me helping my US friend fix his car, I'm sorry, but I won't stop because you don't like it\". The bus driver had turned around again by then, and both him and the old man had (what I perceived as, anyway) a portrait surprised pikachu face. The driver gave me a thumbs up, and the old man just turned around and said nothing else. \n\nI did end up changing seats myself because courtesy, although part of me so wished to stay there and continue, see what would happen. Both me and my US contact had a laugh about it, and so did a work colleague of mine who happened to also be on that bus a few rows back. \n\nAnyway, a select number of coworkers who heard the story did approach me later and told me I shouldn't have replied like that, or at all; and I had that lingering over my head for a few days now. I'd like to think I was as respectful as I could be at the time, while still being firm; but some say you don't talk back to the elderly.

It was because you were speaking in a foreign language. \n\nWTF.", "NTA - you weren\u2019t rude to the older guy", "NTA. If you hadn't responded, he would have kept talking. He wanted a reaction, he got one.  Simple enough.", "NTA\n\nWhy is he interested in a conversation in a foreign language that's none of his business, anyway? He's there to travel on a bus, not eavesdrop on other people's conversations.", "op=NTA\n\nOld age does not excuse xenophobia and rudeness.", "NTA - you tried to appease him and he just wanted to be an angry old guy.  It happens.  The only thing different would be to ask the friend to called him back to speak when you were off the bus.", "Nta at all, that old guy was rude as hell for zero reason.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nYou're rude for carrying on a loud phone conversation on public transit. By your own admission, there was room for you to move further away (which would be similar to stepping out of a restaurant to take a call). The call wasn't an emergency at all.\n\nThe man is out of line for all the abusive remarks and his opinions about people speaking English.", "Hmmm, it's hard to judge because I'm sure this is one of those dilemmas where culture is going to be a sharp dividing line. Anyway, since you did put it out for judgment:\n\nESH because he was mean, but I think you should have let him be. I'm Asian (in Asia), and where I am it's absolutely the case that you don't talk back to the elderly, especially if they're scolding you for some breach of conduct. (We also don't like it when people take phone calls on public transportation, even if it isn't crowded. It's considered rude and intrusive, like you're making your business everyone's business. Even when we book cars for ourselves, we generally ask the driver if we can take a call/the driver asks if they can take a call. Though from what I understand he was cussing you out for speaking English, not for taking the call, right? The xenophobia is sad and I'm sorry that happened to you.)\n\nAnyway, yeah, sitting where I am and reading your account about talking back to a mean old person, I think ESH.\n\nEdited because the old person was being bigoted and that's not okay.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Point taken, though.", ">You're rude for carrying on a loud phone conversation on public transit.\n\nThere's no indication that OP was having a loud phone call. OP could have been using a perfectly respectable indoor voice. \n\n>By your own admission, there was room for you to move further away\n\nSo if OP was sitting with a friend and they decided to strike up a conversation, are you telling me you expect the both of them to move to another seat just so they can do so? And if there *was* no room to move, would you expect them to stay silent? \n\nI don't think you understand how being in public works. When you're in public, sometimes you have to deal with hearing the ppl around you talk to each other, either in person or on the phone. Unless the bus has a specific \"quiet zone\" rule or something, no one is required to be absolutely silent. Having a conversation falls under the reasonable allowance for making sounds-it's not comparable to blasting music or watching a youtube video or something.", "Point taken. It's interesting to read that it is culturally frowned upon to do many of the things that happen over here, over where you are (and possibly many other places as well). Gives a bit of perspective and I'll definitely take those into account in the future. And yes, the main driving element for the man seemed to be primarily the language I was speaking - would explain the deportation and immigration remarks.", "No way. The old man was being a bigot.

Treat *everyone* with respect, and in this case respect does not mean bowing to their whims but treating each other as equals.", "You did nothing wrong.", "You responded perfectly.  Assertive, but civil.  No cussing, no insults.  100%", "Well. You sound like a very nice, polite guy. \nSo I won't say(write) verbatim, but suffice to say the old guy would have been told very clearly that being openly racist isn't acceptable to me and it would be best for him to turn around and shut up. \ud83d\ude09", "\"Mind your own business\" is timeless and to the point.", "Yes - I would agree tricky :)", "I\u2019m Asian, and I tend to disagree and will say NTA. Yeah, respect for elders is a thing, but a lot of elderly people tend to view that as a license to do/say a lot of questionable things. So for me, respect only those who deserve it. \n\nI haven\u2019t met anyone from Uruguay, but during my grad studies in Europe I made a couple of Latin friends. One thing I noticed is they\u2019re not as quiet in public transportation as, say, Germans or Dutch people. So correct me if I\u2019m wrong that the talking on the phone thing isn\u2019t really a big cultural no-no in Uruguay. \n\nEven if it is, the old person was bigoted and xenophobic. This trumps any cultural norm of politeness, and deserved to be put in his place.", "Yes, those remarks are terrible. In fact, I'll go up and change my vote to ESH because on reflection, if you shaved off a few decades from the man who accosted you, I'd 100% be okay with what you said. \n\nI'm of mixed heritage, and while I identify as Asian some people where I am will definitely look at me and see a white girl. It has happened a few times that I'll be speaking English or another language that isn't local and will later overhear people talking about me/to me in the vernacular as if I'm not fluent.

I've learned a new adjective through this post: bigot. I've never seen it before, but after reading through its definition, it's a very clever use! No, I don't use Reddit that much.. yet.", "You're correct about Uruguayan culture. In fact, talking to you from the bus right now, I hear at least two people behind me talking over the phone. Even sending something like a WhatsApp or Snapchat voice message would count under that criteria.. and people do that a lot.", "Thanks for the second comment! What you describe isn't nearly as common over here, which is why I was surprised when that happened to me. But, I do know it's unfortunately frequent in other places. It absolutely is very demoralizing.", "Clearly then he was reacting just to your language (and his prejudices based on that), which makes him the AH and not you. I hope this encounter at least taught him to be more mindful and less judgmental.", "Hopefully, haha. I actually posted elsewhere that deep inside, something about this interaction, not sure what it is, actually made my day. At the very least, it made me feel much better about my English skills; and being I talk with English-speaking people for a living as of writing, it's a very reassuring feeling!"]}
