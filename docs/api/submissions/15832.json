Now, I'm not from France but I did speak French well enough (after studying it for 8+ years and at that point, living in France for several months.) I picked up a call from a friend who wanted to hear about my Spain trip and while I was speaking, this older French couple sitting near me at the gate started complaining and insulting me, saying crap like \"Oh, these annoying Americans think they can do whatever they want!\" (Speaking on the phone...?). They kept being rude and talking about my \"loud\" behavior. I promise you I was chill and quiet cause it was 8am. When I hung up, I turned to them and in French said \"Could you watch my backpack while I fill up my water, please?\" and I genuinely will never forget this couples' faces. The wife turned red while the husband awkwardly said \"Sure\". I walked away with a sense of pride tbh. Got my water and even thanked them when I returned to my seat. \n\nI learned two lessons that day. One: speaking multiple languages (even if you're not perfect) opens up your world and generally is awesome to know, and two: if you're going to talk about someone who can probably hear you, try to figure out if they would understand you.

Let alone the prople who weren't expecting me to speak English - I once was approached by a tourist with a translation app open asking for directions, and as soon as I noticed the language that my words were being translated to was English, I just told her \"oh it's English, feel free to drop the translator\".. she was very delighted and we actually spent quite a lot of time talking about all things tourism. \nWhen I was an evil teenager, I'd sometimes go to places and purposely pretend to only speak English (which alone would be an interesting AITA post) to see what people would do, and even then I got some good interactions going.\n\nUruguay is actually a pretty peaceful place when it comes to foreign people being welcomed with open arms, and I'll continue to think so even after that bad encounter. We often tend to focus on the bad when averaging anything out, and I try my best not to fall victim for that!", "Thank you! Although I wouldn't blame all my coworkers, because we could be dealing with a \"he said, she said\" situation, as I didn't spread the news to all of them on my own. \n\nAlthough now, I guess I can point them to this post. \ud83d\ude05", "Push overs.. another adjective I just learned. \n\nThank you!", "Cheers!

Your colleagues were not there and don't know the context nor saw how you spoke back to him. Some people like to be the moralising agent in things they don't know. Sometimes I find it best to say less to certain people.", "I am sure it's partly that but there's another reason as well. Many bigoted people who live or used to live in homogeneous societies tend to find it unacceptable to have their countries evolve to become more inclusive. It's a fairly toxic form of nostalgia.

Edit to add: I also have the vocabulary of a very well educated sailor. So thats fun! Lol", "That's another thing that helps! If you have an extensive vocabulary, regardless of language, and know how to use it, you can kind of gain  some social status. Bonus points if you can combine that with chewing someone out.", "It also helps to mix in some lovely swear words. Lmao most people who think they r in a position of superiority don't expect it. Really messes up their mind, cuz it's so unexpected and so disrespectful. Reinforces rhe idea that u ear respect,not demand it or assume it's owed to u by society.
