I remember pointing it out to her and all she told me was that it\u2019s ingrained in their culture and they don\u2019t mean any harm. For context, her family is Chinese. My wife does not share the same views.\n\nAnyways, we have two sons (8 and 6). The first thing my mil said to us when she saw our eldest for the first time was \u201che\u2019s going to have such nice white skin.\u201d As he got older, she and my wife\u2019s aunts would make more comments about him and would constantly talk about how his eyes are beautiful, how nice and skinny and tall he is, how white his skin is etc. It\u2019s like they don\u2019t see him for anything else but how he looks. \n\nEventually, I got really tired of this as my son started to insult his brother by saying he had whiter skin. He also made comments about how his brother has tiny eyes, a wider nose etc and obviously this is fucked up. For context, my elder son is more \u201cwhite passing\u201d whereas my younger son looks more Asian. I told my wife if the comments persisted, I wouldn\u2019t let her mother near our kids again.\n\nShe said okay and that I was right and the comments stopped. \n\nI came home from work yesterday and my wife was talking to her mom on the phone with the speaker on. My mil then started talking about how we should get our 8 year old son to model because he\u2019s just perfect and she hasn\u2019t seen a kid with whiter skin. My wife laughed awkwardly and said she\u2019d think about it but I was pissed. \n\nI spoke up and said \u201cNo we won\u2019t think about it, the answer is no. You sound creepy and if you say another word about how our children look you will not be allowed near them.\u201d \n\nHer mom went silent before screaming at me and my wife glared at me. The two then started speaking Mandarin so I couldn\u2019t understand but they hung up and my wife went \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re happy now, asshole.\u201d \n\nShe\u2019s really upset and said that her mom wants an apology but I refuse. She says I\u2019m being ignorant and can\u2019t blame her mother as she grew up with this mindset. AITA?

There's a difference between understanding how a toxic mindset from a different time/culture influences a person's behavior and accepting and perpetuating it. \n\nI know this isn't isolated to women, but in America there's tons of pressure on women about how they look. I remember my mom looking for a new job in her late 40s/early 50s after the tech bubble popped in Austin in the early 00s. Woman had a PhD, decades of experience and a plethora of patents and publications under her belt, but she would look in the mirror and wonder if she should get botox to look younger. She was constantly concerned about her weight. And she never ended up finding new employment. \n\nMy mom knew this was bad, and after she'd say those things about herself she'd wince and then encourage me to pick up a paintbrush instead of a make up brush. You can be a creature of your upbringing and still want something better for the younger generation. It doesn't seem like your MIL has any desire for things to change. \n\nWhitewashing is unfortunately very common in many countries. In America we generally see it as a racial thing (and it almost always is here), but in other places it's often more to do with wealth and social hierarchy. If you work outside doing manual labor you're tan and if you're indoors you're pale. It's less racism and more classism. But then the world shrinks and cultures collide and you get a mash-up of the two and it's even more distasteful.", "NTA. Maybe apologize for the way you delivered the message? But you are right to protect both sons from these comments.", "This and my kids thinking their looks are all they\u2019re worth are my biggest concerns.", "I want to emphatically agree about the bullying.", "THIS RIGHT HERE. And racism and colorism are 100% damaging. As a brown woman with very pale relatives (also Asian, but not Chinese), I've been thought it all my life and it SUX. OP good on you for taking a firm stance and please hold firm. NTA at all.", "THIS is AWESOME. Thanks for sharing. So glad grandma came around!", "My brother kinda did the same to our grandma.\nShe grew up in a homophobic society and it took 7 years for my brother to come out to her, when he was out for the whole family.\nMy grandma has ha a reaaaaally large tumour remived from her brain, benign but it left her with side effects from removing such a mass. So she says things like they come to mind, without filter. That's weird to witness \n\nWhen he came out to her, shr yook it well. But then he had a talk for about one hour to explain to her that using the f word to refer to homosexual men was really offensive (in my country, people tend to use it a lot). Her neighbours are gay men, and she kept referring to them as f words. So he asked her what she xould call them, again and again until she stopped calling them f words. I haven't heard her say the word ever since. It was no small victory given the neurological damages!\n\nShe still racist af though...", "My great grandma had said the n word with the o at the end instead of the hard r, she thought that it made it okay. Grandma let her know that is wasn't. \n\nGlad your grandma was able to learn, and I hope she is doing better!!\n\nOur grandmas prove that you *can* teach an old dog new tricks!"]}
