My experience has been *very* different.", "Her dad apologized to her brother, who it was directed toward.", "You\u2019re awesome, die on this hill. NTA.", "You\u2019re a really good sister, and even if he doesn\u2019t say it I\u2019m sure you\u2019re bother is extremely grateful to you for having his back and standing up for him.", "Same here", "NTA\n\nAnd your dad has some wonky logic, if he won\u2019t spend time with your brothers boyfriend because he\u2019s a \u201cperverted cocksucker\u201d, when your brother is of the same persuasion.  I personally loved your quick comeback and your dad is behaving like an asshole. Holy patriarchy and homophobia batman", "NTA.\n\nThat was GLORIOUS!", "NTA You're not making your mom choose---your dad is. And honestly, isn't this what he wanted? An excuse not to meet his son's boyfriend at Christmas? \n\nAlso, you deserve an award for that comeback.", "According to Mrs. Florence Hartley, beloved author of \u201cThe Ladies Book of Etiquette,\u201d \n\n*\u201d\u2026If your companion uses words or expressions which you cannot understand, do not affect knowledge, or be ashamed of your ignorance, but frankly ask for an explanation.\u201d*\n\n  I\u2019m sure Mrs. Hartley would agree that you followed rules of manners beautifully. As do I. \n\nNTA", "NTA!!!!", "NTA.\n\nI love your comment! Like it's the truth, male or female when paired up with a guy, we suck cock.  That is simply how it is.", "NTA You are an awesome sister and all-around person! You didn't use any words your dad didn't. You took his mean, homophobic comment and turned it back on him...hilariously I might add! You did nothing wrong.\nBut even if you had, you're still not the one making your mom choose. Both parents are still invited to your house on Christmas. If your dad is so butthurt about your cock sucking comments that he's not going to spend a holiday with his family, that's on him. And if your mother supports that decision, that's on her.", "NTA and a bit of a legend tbh. Hit 'em right in the double standards.", "NTA\nThat's the best possible thing you could have said. I had to prevent myself from bursting into laughter since it's night where I am", "NTA\nYou only repeated back what he said, if he think you were crass then he was first. He should be the on to apologize to everyone since his classless caused yours.", "NTA and I love that energy! Crass beliefs warrant crass responses. Legendary.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nShouldn't he be the one apologize for being crass & rude at your house? You only responded   \n with something crass. \n\nAlso you are not the one forcing your mom to choose he is, since i've not seen you say he's not welcome at your home anymore.", "NTA. You really took the heat like an excellent ally. Also super hilarious response! Your Mom can make her own decisions.", "NTA! I would have called your dad a pervert himself considering he's spending time thinking about and sulking over what someone he doesn't know does in the bedroom.", "NTA\n\nDid him not saying anything means he considers you a pervert, like he does his son's boyfriend? Well if his son got an apology for that comment, then why on earth is he asking you to apologise for yours, which basically mirrors what he's 'apologising' for in the first place. All sortsa paradoxical.\n\nApologise. Make him believe it. Then you and his potential son-in-law should wear matching I love cock t-shirts, or maybe jumpers this time of year, at your Christmas get together. With a big rooster in the middle, gotta keep it friendly for the kids.", "NTA - You don't owe him an apology, and you're not the one forcing this decision on your mother - he is. He set the ball in motion, and is now doubling down with ultimatums. These are the things controlling fathers do. Whether it's pride, shame, or a mixture of both, that man is entirely in the wrong and is too cowardly to admit it to himself.", "NTA and sister, I salute you. You\u2019re not making your mom choose, your dad did that as soon as he made the original crass comment. Just how welcome would your bro and his partner feel with that kind of attitude sitting under the surface? And I\u2019m going to go out on a limb here and assume that your dad has no doubt had his own cock sucked, so he can GGF with this ridiculous notion that it\u2019s perverted if it\u2019s same sex but just peachy if it\u2019s oppose sex.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re not the one forcing your mother to choose, your father is. Stand your ground. Your brother is worth defending, and your father needs to know he doesn\u2019t get to get away with bullying someone about their sexuality\u2014or he\u2019ll do the same with his grandchildren.", "NTA this is a hilarious way to defend your brother. I love both the intention and the way you turned your father's ugly words around to show him how ridiculous he was/is being.", "YOU are not forcing your mom to choose between you \n\nYOUR DAD is the one forcing her to choose. YOU told the truth (while a blunt one, still truth) and you asked a question. HE was homophobic and a bigot. \n\nYou are NTA but you \u201cdad\u201d certainly is and I would tell him \u201cwell you aren\u2019t invited anyways, mom certainly still is, but we won\u2019t expose our children to homophobic bigots who treat family members partners like trash\u201d", "You're amazing and I love you.", "That snappy comeback was exactly what your dad deserved - beautifully executed OP!\n\nNTA, a million times over", "NTA and this is the cr\u00e8me de La cr\u00e8me of comebacks!  This is literally the best one I\u2019ve seen and can just imagine the look on your fathers face. Priceless.", "this is the best way to call out intolerant assholes (even if they are your own dad)- youre a killer ally and such a great sister NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s pretty clear who TA is here and it\u2019s the old man with a potty mouth, some old-fashioned ideas, and an ego that won\u2019t back down.", "Legend", "Her father brought up sucking dick first\u2026 there was nothing left for her to ruin after that", "How could you not see this? Sounds like the man is pretty used to having the women in his life clean up his messes.", "I sure hope so. Maybe the time has come for mom to stand up and choose her family. She seems to have some power if she got dad to apologize to their son.", "Yeah. OP, you are my hero.\n\nNTA", "I love the unintentional double entendre. \ud83d\ude04", "Fair enough. I guess I get it from my dad \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Source?", "I think gender is *way* higher on that list.", "I honestly feel like sexual orientation and gender are gonna be the highest two or should be very near the top of that list.", "and politics is definitely last on the list. In fact, the list might just be backwards.", "Truth is, an ordered list is bullshit through and through. Highest priority goes to whatever category can currently be leveraged the most.\n\nIt's not about what is most or least egregious with these people, it's about whatever supposed slight is currently causing a loss of deference. The most heinous is whatever is challenging the authority in any given moment.", "Hmmm... I'd leave that pretty high, but it probably really matters where you are.", "NTA. You better never apologize OP. Your response to his crappy one was ON POINT! \ud83d\ude4c", "NTA- your father crassly insulted your guest in your house. He is the only one that owes an apology.", "NTA. Hilarious retort, congrats!", "Nta", "NTA, but rather than laughing at him you can be the better person and say I will apologize if you apologize to me for causing the problem that night. \n\nWhen you use moral high ground to justify shitty behavior you are no different.", "NTA\nDo Not Apologize.\nYou were in your own home ffs. Be as crass as you want in your own home.", "NTA gods I wish I had thought of this roughly 25 years ago! My dad said the exact same thing to my brother.\n\nYour mom can choose to come without your dad. Don't let that boundary be smooshed. \n\nYou're brilliant.", "NTA. Well done standing up for your sibling, bonus points for creativity and extra credit for crassness. You are a wonderful sister.", "Both are YTA. Your father may have been perverse in a family meeting, but then so were you. What if one of the kids had heard?", "Ofc you're not the asshole.\nIf they don't come you go instead. Your mom will be happy and your dad's ego can be bend a bit for everyone else to have fun. You're not gonna change him but you don't have to deprive your mom from her family", "Father: Says something crass\n\nDaughter: Says the exact same thing  \nFather: HOW COULD YOU BE SO CRASS\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA, but your father is. And your answer was briliant.", "NTA Your Christmas will be much nicer without your bigoted parents around.", "Canadians don\u2019t always need to apologize and you shouldn\u2019t have to here. He\u2019s being horrible and I\u2019m sure your mother made him apologize to your brother. \n\nYou did nothing wrong \u2026 NTA", "NTA, and what your mom never gave him a bj? You don't owe your dad shit. Yeah I know, it's gross to think of your parents that way.", "You are NTA and also a legend.  That response is absolutely perfect.   \n\nYour comment was 0% more crass than his, and he's not apologized to you for his crassness.", "okay but pls why is thanksgiving in October just because it's Canada....? Pls i don't understand I was failed by the American education system", "NTA.  But I wouldn't sell your mom short.  I bet she has him there and on his best behavior.  But you might want to chat with mom on the DL.", "NTA, no tolerance or excuses for homophobia in 2022, and also he doesn't get to decide where your mom goes you should invite her and lay it on thick explaining grandbabies all want grandma there for Christmas.", "Brava, OP, Brava! NTA and if I had an award I would give it to you.", "The original commenter is right, I think If you also be the bigger person and say your still invited no apology needed your point will also be more clear after all you just want to all be a loving and happy family.", "I said this elsewhere, but I'm saying it here again in hopes you see it, OP. Your dad is the asshole in this situation. He is the one making her choose, and she *does* need to choose if he refuses to back down. Your brother needs love and support, not people kowtowing to nasty bigotry for the sake of \"not rocking the boat.\" This is a hill to die on.", "It's so important for this to be said! The person making the mom choose between her husband and kids is the husband. He's the one being an asshole so it's up to him to quit being an asshole. This *is* a hill to die on and it *is* something the mom should have to make a choice on, if her husband won't back down. Enabling this kind of assholery is, itself, asshole behavior.", "This explains why I've never gotten a single apology out of my dad for anything", "Your mom sounds like my mom, and my mom is the best damn person I know. Just saying, this situation sucks (dick-joke intended), but WHAT a silver lining to have such a kick-ass momma, right?\n\nNTA and give your mom a high five from the Internet.", "Madonna/whore binary. \"Pure\" women with children probably didn't enjoy sex the few times they've ever had it, they only did it as an obligation. Women who enjoy sex are whores. Your Dad can't fathom that women are complex humans with sexual desires.", "Truly, that comment was fucking golden. No lgbtq child should have to deal with parents like this, but if they do, I hope it\u2019s with a sibling like OP. So far from TA.", "Because his wife likely made him. A different kind of pressure was applied. NTA for OP", "Literally all of those, except maybe age, are things that people get disowned for"]}
