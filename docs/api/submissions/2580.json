My other brother and I have known for about a decade, and I think my mom knew, but waited for him to tell her. my dad, well, he's an interesting man. he doesn't ooze tolerance, he doesn't say much because he knows my mom will give him shit for it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe had thanksgiving at our place (were in Canada, so it was in October) we have most gatherings at our place, we have 2 guest rooms and the basement is set up as a play area, so my kid, and my oldest brothers 3 hang out down there except for the meal usually.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy brother had told my parents a few days before thanksgiving. He is in a serious relationship now (he's had a lot of non serious, few months long relationships) and wanted to bring him to our Christmas get together. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nafter the meal, the kids had gone back down stairs and all the adults were sitting around upstairs, we were having some drinks. I was pretty tipsy, my dad was pretty drunk. we were talking about Christmas and may brother mentioned his boyfriend coming. My mom started asking about him, wanting to meet him sooner, not wait till Christmas, what kind of things does he like so she can get a few gifts for him. All was going well, and my brother seemed really happy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nuntil my dad, drunk said \"I'm not having that perverted cock sucker at our Christmas get together.\" So, me being tipsy, before anyone else could say anything said, rather loudly \"I suck cock, does that make me a pervert?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings obviously went down hill fast from there, My mom (who hadn't been drinking) took my dad away. To our surprise she turned up at our place again 45 minutes later, joined the rest of u drinking and we had a good evening.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, this was a bit over a month ago. I've talked to my mom lots, she doesn't share much, but it seems like her and my dad are on rocky ground. He has since apologized to my brother, though my brother says it seemed forced. My dad called me this morning and told me he is still waiting on my apology. I obviously asked what for, he said for the \"crass\" comment I made. I'll admit, I laughed and said no, I meant what I said and would not be apologizing for it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe now says he and my mother will not be coming to Christmas at my house. Although, I can't see my mom missing Christmas with her 4 grandkids. which is what makes me feel like a bit of an asshole, I don't want to force my mom to choose between my dad and the rest of us, but I really don't think I did anything actually wrong and don't want to apologize.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLT;DR; my dad called my brothers boyfriend a \"cock sucking pervert\" to which I said \"I suck cock, does that make me a pervert\". I don't want to apologize to my dad, and if I don't he said he and my mom won't come to Christmas, I feel bad making my mom choose between my dad and the rest of us.", "created_utc": 1668712807, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxyw0h/aita_for_being_crass_and_refusing_to_apologize_to/", "score": 146, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why isn't your father apologizing to YOU for being crass?", "NTA.....LOLOLOLOLOL.....OMG that was the GREATEST comeback I've heard in ages!  Well done you!  While an unfortunate situation with Christmas and all, the only one who should be apologizing is your Dad.", "NTA. He's doing you a favor by not coming over for Christmas.", "NTA. \n\nFirst, your response was PRICELESS. I love it so much. \n\nSecond \u2014 your father started as the crass one. Stir shit and see what comes out. \n\nThird \u2014 he\u2019s the one making your mom choose. You have no blame here.", "NTA. Your dad is just embarrassed that he got called out so directly on his bigotry. He'll get over it and learn something or he won't and will remain bitter about it forever, but either way you'll know what kind of person he is.", "Lmao that was an excellent comeback! And NTA. Your father shouldn't have been crass (and a couple of other things) himself if he wanted to keep things classy.", "NTA \n\nWhat a wonderful response to his homophobic bs", "NTA. If you were blatantly talking about sucking cock unprovoked, fine, but it was literally a response to his crass *and* homophobic behavior. \n\nI'm sorry for your mom's position, but she can make her own choices. That definitely doesn't depend on you giving your father a fake apology he doesn't deserve.", "NTA Your dad is the ah here, thank you for standing up for your brother. He should apologize to the whole family for his comments, not just your brother, as it's incredibly disrespectful.\n\nI would tell mom she's free to come and try and find a way to sneak her out if need be. Dad doesn't get to dictate her relationship with her kids and grandkids, and she sounds like one heck of a mom!", "NTA, your Dad needs to sort out his priorities in life, not you.", "NTA.  He said it, so why can't you?", "NTA. You stood up for your brother when he was being ostracized and your father is the one forcing an ultimatum, not you.", "YTL.

Good on you for sticking up for your brother. I'm surprised he still even wants to speak to your dad.

Let your mom know she's absolutely welcome without your father if he doesn't want to come.   Even if she knows, say it anyway.", "NTA.  \n\nYour dad needs to apologize for being a vulgar homophobic bully.  That\u2019s where the apologies begin and end.  \n\nYou may want to give your mom a heads up that your dad is on one so she can plan accordingly.", "Funny how the dad assumes his son is the one getting head. \n\nSilly man.

Dad should be the one to apologise for acting like an arse, but unfortunately I don't foretell a sincere apology. Still, who knows, one day he might realise how wrong his outdated and absurd views are.\n\nNo, no. Certainly do not apologise. You showed him that kind of behaviour is not only intolerable, but will be met with the entirely correct amount of vitriol. You taught your father a valuable lesson. And, my dear barb-tongued friend, I do believe your mom will choose her children over the man who assisted her in their creation. She seems like a good mom and that's apparently a good mom thing. Offer her help in getting to Christmas if she needs or wants it, but don't blame your dad's ego on yourself.\n\nNTA.", "I\u2019ll be damned if I let someone come into my house, insult my family, and then demand an apology when I fire back. Nope. NTA. \n\nYou may want to point out to your dad that you will not apologize for what you said in the comfort of your own home, in the defense of your brother. Self righteous old men love to die on that hill. \n\nAnd your mom sounds like she\u2019s trying - maybe reiterate to her that she\u2019s always welcome.
