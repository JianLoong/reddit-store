I 17 F was told my whole life that if I do amazing in school I will get a large reward when I'm 16-18. I have done more than my part I am a 4.0 students meaning I got all A's my entire education I am now a junior in highschool. When I was 15 I paid and went through drivers Ed by myself. I was told I was gonna get a small gas efficient car. Before I got my permit my mom and her now ex bf went car shopping and picked out like they said a small gas efficient vehicle. For those who wonder what car it's a 2006 scion xa. I am very very grateful for my little meep meep. It is perfect for me, my dog, and my partner 17M . I want to also mention I no longer live with my mother for the fact of if it's not done her way it's the highway. So I decided the highway would be best. She told me since I was leaving give her back the car so I did. All while she has the vehicle she decided she needs to extra money and took a loan out on it. She didn't pay it back on time and it collected a lottttt of interest. Now what should have only been a $3,000 vehicle is almost $10,000 or at least she says I haven't seen the receipts and don't care. She realized I needed a vehicle to get to school since I don't have a bus stop where my new house is so she gave me meep back. It's been a year and I'm now homeschooled, work full-time at an assisted living and bring home $800 dollar checks each pay period (2x a month). I have car repairs, bills of my own, savings, food for animals. So my money and my partners money goes twords things of use. She got on rental assistance and said I'm still living with her so she gets more off since it'll appear she has a minor in the house. I allowed her because then she wouldn't ask for more money from me. She also decided she was going to let my other sister 15F move in and away from her drunk dad. (Dad said he will pay her to take her and my sister also works). She has a vehicle it's an old 90s van that is a huge gas hog she doesn't want to trade it in for a smaller vehicle that's more gas efficient because in her words what will she have to camp in and she needs something to haul her broken motorcycle. But she said now that my sister is back with her in a week I need to start paying \u00be of the car payment. I told her I feel it's wrong and twisted since she was the one who said she would get me a car if I did good and she was the one who took the loan out on it...so AITA \n\nI will add updates if anyone wants.", "created_utc": 1667159457, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yho1u6/aita_for_telling_my_mom_im_not_helping_with_car/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was a 3,000 loan, and she made irresponsible choices that had nothing to do with you, and now the loan is 10,000, more than 3x what your car was sold for. And she wants YOU to pay 3/4 of the loan? \n\nIt doesn't work like that, return the car to her and tell her to get bent.   Also I'd recommend checking your credit score/what open lines of debt/credit are in your name, if you can.  It's possible that they took the loan out in your name;  in which case this would be above reddits pay grade, and I would seek legal advice."]}
