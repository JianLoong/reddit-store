Daughter is ignoring my texts/calls. Here's what happened this morning:\n\nMy daughter (26) came by to visit. She's been working long hours for a promotion to the next level. She works in the technology sector. Her team is male-dominated and she's the youngest one there. She's been working towards this promotion for more than a year now and was visibly frustrated. She said she doesn't understand why she's not getting this promotion. Alongside this, she complained about feeling underestimated by her teammates and not feeling like they take her seriously.\n\nI was honest and told her she doesn't carry herself in a way that suggests competence. She occasionally works from home in my spare office and I've heard some of her meetings. She way too often says \"like\" and \"ummm\" as fillers, her sentences often end in the question tone when she means them as statements, and she is in general way too accommodating and a total pushover. Example: instead of \"That works\", she'll say something like \"that's like totally fine\". \n\nI get that it's normal for how twenty-something year old women communicate but I was trying to help my daughter by pointing out that this is hurting her. Well I got my head bitten off for trying to help. She accused me of \"mansplaining\" her own feelings to her when it's something I do not understand (because I've never worked in the technology industry before nor know what it's like to be a woman in a male-dominated workplace). She also told me I don't need to \"talk down\" to her and should instead be empathetic and support her in her own skin, as I (in her eyes) am telling her to change herself into a masculine personality to succeed whereas instead I should understand that it should be the norm that assumptions shouldn't be made about her competence just because she doesn't communicate as aggressively as her male coworkers. Somehow, what I said makes me a sexist and an unsupportive dad, and one that apparently she doesn't want to communicate with anymore.\n\nI was only trying to help. Honestly, I don't get her anger at me and this whole situation has left me quite heartbroken. I don't understand or maybe my own bias is getting in my way.\n\nAITA or is my daughter being completely unfair?", "created_utc": 1679884495, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1238iv0/aita_for_mansplaining_to_my_26_yr_old_daughter/", "score": 183, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let me tell you something that happened this week. \n\nMy former boss was male. He was promoted recently, and his replacement is female. In last year\u2019s evaluation, the only criticism he gave me was that I needed to work on my \u201ctone\u201d. It\u2019s something every male boss I\u2019ve ever had has written down on my evaluations for the last 20 years. \n\nMy new female boss wrote an entire paragraph about how my \u201ctone\u201d was just fine, and that I am very helpful and service-oriented, but I will be firm and professional when I need to be, and she wrote down \u201cI have no idea why previous evaluations have focused on \u201ctone\u201d when Jade has always been nothing but professional\u201d. \n\nAnd my former male boss was a big proponent of defending smart, capable women in our workplace. And even he focused on stereotypical things like \u201ctone\u201d or calling a woman defending her work \u201caggressive\u201d. \n\nDon\u2019t be the dad that tells his strong, smart daughter to acquiesce to what men think a woman should be. She gets to be her. Her work should speak for itself. \n\nAnd space holders like \u201cummm\u201d and \u201clike\u201d are not gender specific. Everyone uses them. Even men.", "YTA\n\nShe wanted you to listen and let her vent. If she\u2019d wanted advice she\u2019d have asked for it.\n\nShe\u2019s in a male dominated field man. Let\u2019s be real - her lack of advancement has nothing to do with \u2018umms\u2019 and \u2018ahhs\u2019", "Woman in tech here: YTA.\n\nWomen have to make questions out of statements, because if we don't, we're \"too aggressive.\"  If we stand up for ourselves or are direct about our ideas, we're \"too aggressive.\" Basically, any time a woman does what a man would do, we're \"too aggressive.\" I guarantee you that other members of her team use \"like\" and \"uhh\" as well, and they're not losing promotions because of it.", "I have a strong suspicion if your daughter came in here and explained her side of the conversation, a lot more would be revealed. But look on the bright side: she stood up for herself against you. Guess you showed her she\u2019s capable.", "YTA. Fucking yikes. There\u2019s so much sexism in the workplace, especially in the technology sector. I promise you that how she carries herself has nothing to do with her lack of promotion.\n\nLittle tip for you, if she doesn\u2019t ask for your advice, don\u2019t give it.", "Yta. You admit you don't understand the tech industry or being a woman in it but are still convinced you know more than she does. That is, in fact, mansplaining.", "YTA\n\nThe roadmap of what communication worked at your companies, in your time, in your roles required assertiveness. Now, directness and assertiveness is not interpreted as being a team player. You may have been right once, on face value, with your rules of engagement and communication.\n\nThe world has changed, but also the rules are clearly different for her. Women have to thread a shitty needle of not appearing meek or overly-assertive at the same time. The fact that you do not see it through that lens makes your rules of engagement factually incorrect.\n\nBut the fact that you did not communicate your concerns in a way that was well received leads me to believe that you could have done better. I mean, you clearly know more about communicating than she does? For someone who claims to know how to communicate to the point that they can give advice, you didn\u2019t land the plane of your points.", "You\u2019re so deep in the patriarchy you can\u2019t even see it. The ironic thing is you\u2019ve explained exactly to your daughter why she\u2019s not getting the promotion. Sexism in the workplace. LOL. I\u2019m glad you are going to try to educate yourself about your own bias, yay you! We can all do better. And even if you thought she was unprofessional (professionalism is a construct of the patriarchy btw) this was a classic case where you should  have asked \u2018do you want me to just listen or do you want advice?\u2019 YTA.", "Sometimes people are just looking for a listening ear and empathy. While you were well-intentioned, it sounds like your daughter wasn't looking for any feedback or tips. I'd tell her you're sorry, that you thought what you had to say would be helpful, but you realize it wasn't. Tell her you will always support her 100% and want to see her succeed. We should always ask someone if they'd like help rather than jumping straight to that ourselves. It's so tempting because we do care and we do want to help, but it's not always what people need, at least in that moment.", "YTA.  You don\u2019t know why she hasn\u2019t gotten the promotions, you\u2019re just assuming her employer holds the same sexist stereotypes you do.", "Sounds like she explained her anger and frustration clearly, why don\u2019t you get it?\n\nYTA", "If her boss needs her to speak with fewer filler words (reasonably request for client calls) they should be communicating that. There should be a clear path for advancement. YTA for making a lot of assumptions. If you know of some resources to aid in speaking confidently, sharing those without commentary would have been appropriate.", "YTA \n\nThis has been well researched. It\u2019s the warmth competency trade off women are forced to make. Men aren\u2019t forced to choose between appearing warm or competent. They can be seen as both and it helps them successes. Women have to choose between the two and each holds them back from success in different ways. \n\nMaybe don\u2019t try and explain a phenomenon that has several researchers across various disciplines studying it. Instead trust that women who are living and working as women in professional fields know more about being a women in a given professional field than you, as a cis man know. \n\nFfs why do men think they know how to be a women better than woman does?", "YTA\n\nShe was venting frustrations, and instead of listening and saying \"oh that sucks\", you told her why she was the  problem. She didn't want you to \"fix\" her problem.", "Woman in tech here. Wow, YTA", "YTA, and yes it is your own bias getting the way.", "YTA And then, when she\u2019s more aggressive, her male co-workers will call her a bitch. No win situation here.

Just like everyone else has said, \u201clike\u201d and \u201cum\u201d aren\u2019t gender specific. Plus she\u2019s in a male-dominated field. She just needed you to listen and support her without nitpicking.", "YTA\n\nBut thanks giving her a real life demonstration that her feelings of being underestimated and not being taken seriously for petty reasons are right on the money.\n\n\u201cMaybe my own bias is getting in my way.\u201d This statement gives me hope. 100% yes, it is. Take a backseat, listen to your daughter and offer support, not judgement and ill-conceived advice.", "Woman in science in corporate America here. We shouldn\u2019t have to act like men to be rewarded and shame on you for saying we should. You aren\u2019t just part of the problem\u2026. It sounds like you\u2019re one of the cofounders of the problem  YTA\nAnd have you ever considered why she might not present herself in a strong assertive fashion? Spoiler alert: it\u2019s because men have fundamentally destroyed women\u2019s confidence by being over bearing know it alls in the work place. I welcome behavior like your daughter\u2019s and hope it upends the toxic male work environments. Cuz men like you make life miserable for women", "YTA \n\nShe's right. You were completely sexist and unsupportive. So now, not only does she have to put up with sexist bs at work, but she's just copped it from her own dad. No wonder she doesn't want to talk to you anymore. \n\nShe was also right in saying that you have no idea how hard it is to be a woman in a male-dominated field. It's exhausting and can often feel pretty dehumanising. \n\nI'd be mad at you too. Heck, I kind of am.", "Yeah that's kinda the reason I don't tell my parents stuff that DIDN'T work out, but only stuff that worked.\nEven if I know what went wrong, my dad will lecture me as if I was a school kid. Leave me alone, let me make my own decisions and just listen when I want to complain. If I ever want to complain again, because anyway all I get is a lecture I didnt ask for\n\nYTA", "Info: did she ask for your advice or input? Or was she simply venting?", "YTA but only sort of. \n\nYou messed up when you made it a criticism instead of a suggestion. This is why people usually go with \u201chave confidence\u201d because that basically encapsulates the kind of mannerisms you\u2019re wanting to promote to her. Instead of going \u201cyou do these things that hurt you in this way,\u201d you probably should have said something like \u201cPeople will respond to this kind of behavior with more respect.\u201d", "Soft YTA. You said the right thing the wrong way. You framed it as though the problem is her, when in fact the problem is that she works in a sexist, male-dominated field where acting like a woman can be a hindrance. The way you phrased it was sexist, even if your intent was not. I understand your daughter\u2019s anger at being told by a man with no experience in what she\u2019s going through that she doesn\u2019t act competent. It seems like you need to unpack some of your own biases before offering further advice, and try listen to your daughter in good faith to understand why what you said was so upsetting.", "YTA the conversations you heard were most likely only her end denying you any context of those she is meeting with and the different levels she was working with. I also deeply suspect you don't have the details of her company's culture.", "So what you say about carrying yourself in a confident way. Definitely true. \n\nBut YTA. You\u2019re picking apart the way she speaks and now she may not be comfortable working in your home because she knows you can hear her *and that you are judging her* \n\nBeing honest is a wonderful thing, but it works best with Tact. Given she was already upset and frustrated, the LAST thing she wants to hear is her own father criticizing her.", "YTA, especially for saying that the umm and like stuff is normal for twenty-something *women*. Tons of us probably had to work on public speaking (law school mock trial work got that stuff out of my speech patterns), but it\u2019s not gender specific, and if people\u2019s work product is excellent, the speech patterns shouldn\u2019t hold them back. I do not judge capability or competence based on the number of umms or likes. Why do you?", "YTA. Woman in transport here, I have been the only female in countless meetings and I know I have to watch my tone a heck of a lot more than my male coworkers.", "YTA and I'm sure you have let down your daughter in many other ways. I can understand why her mother is an ex wife!", "YTA, apologize immediately and sincerely and do not give her unsolicited advice again", "Woman in education: YTA\n\nDude. I am a teacher who speaks in front of teenagers everyday. I have spent 15 years learning the concepts I teach. \n\nGuess what! I still say ummmmm and like as I am connecting my thoughts. You need to grovel if you ever want to be in her inner circle again.", "I really do see where you're coming from and believe it's a genuine place of support, but honestly YTA and I think you were being patronising (not sure it's quite manspaining, but I'm a guy so I just can't really judge that tbh). \n\nI'm similar age to your daughter, and in the process of moving into tech industry and a huge chunk of my friends are tech people. You admit you don't know the slightest thing about the tech industry. I'm not an expert, but I do know that we're nerdy people. Usually not very confident or assertive, and the kind of language your daughter seems to use is much more common in tech, and just not seen as negatively as it would be in other professional roles like business or law etc. \n\nPeople tend to care a lot more about what you've done and what you can do than your communication skills (and honestly that's a big problem in a lot of tech companies!) But there's definitely a lot of sexism, particularly at higher management levels, and there's heaps of studies and evidence showing women are held down unfairly. If your daughter firmly believes she should have already got this promotion, it's very likely she's right. There's a very good chance that the best move for her now is actually to move company. If she has done the work, and got the skills and knowledge, she'll get a better job somewhere else. There's also a good chance that her boss will skip over her again next time a promotion is due, for whatever poxy reasons he had last time. \n\nI get you wanted to help and you don't really think it was \"unhelpful\" but if she says she's being overlooked and you say \"actually from my viewpoint your doing X, Y and Z wrong\", when you're honestly not best placed to advise, it comes off as \"I think your bosses might be right\" even though you've literally no reason to think she's wrong. \n\nSorry bud, YTA, but I think it'll be a really easy bridge to mend, if you just do some homework on how to give her confidence and encourage her in tech, and talk to her again in a supportive way instead of critical.", "YTA. Wow. I believe you could've listened to your daughter and gotten more information from her and delivered the same message in a way she could've possibly heard. Competence? Wow. Now she won't trust you. You've got to work harder at communicating. Irony everywhere.\n\nEdit: oh, and I wonder where her lack of confidence comes from!? A mystery.", "YTA. You're incredibly sexist and I'm betting her workplace is as well. Keep your mouth shut and never, ever offer any feedback on your daughter's career unless she asks for it directly.", "NAH\n\nI\u2019m a woman in IT, I have a naturally high Cali/valley girl accent/tone even though I\u2019m from dallas. I\u2019ve had to work very hard to be taken seriously\u2026 but if she is good at her job and her vocabulary is the only thing holding her back, her manager should be communicating it.\n\nIt\u2019s a very real possibility that she\u2019s getting passed over for men even if she is equally as qualified.", "YTA.\n\nI have literally been an engineering manager in tech field and I wouldn't feel comfortable saying the things you said.\n\nThe correct answer here is to tell her she should ask for feedback from her manager and a concrete growth plan.", "Soft YTA\n\nThis is a tough one actually. The main reason for YTA is due to not having the sense to read the room. She was looking for support and not advice. Having said that\u2026\n\nI have been a manager of managers and have sent female managers to women-led months-long leadership workshops to promote growth of women in the workplace. One of the pieces of feedback they came back and told me about was, in fact, the way they were carrying themselves and speaking. The ending in a question is a very common piece of feedback given and it does undermine. I saw the statement above that a female in tech said that they have to talk this way to avoid being seen as too aggressive. This perpetuates the issue. Being made to feel that you have to speak this way to get by perpetuates the sidelining. \n\nI do think the OPs daughter should ask (their work) about a leadership program. Asking mom or dad for advice (or them giving it) isn\u2019t ideal. Ideally, find one that is geared towards women if possible. Role models who can relate are important. \n\nI\u2019m a dude and my best boss/mentors have been women. I don\u2019t know what it is like to be a woman in the workplace but it doesn\u2019t mean I shouldn\u2019t be doing my part to ensure we don\u2019t perpetuate the bulls**t of the last forever number of years.", "NTA\u2026 as a woman\u2026 I agree with her but I also see where you\u2019re coming from. Even though we don\u2019t like the way the world & corporate world work sometimes, it is what it is. No different than me being covered in tattoos, but mostly covering them up when attending in-person work functions\u2026 how we present ourselves does matter and impact how we\u2019re treated.", "Honestly your advice sounded pretty spot on.  NTA", "YTA. I'd really love for you to explain how your daughter's \"umm\" and \"like\" talk is any different than the men her age. Imagine how heartbroken your daughter may be because you don't take her seriously. The boys' club of the working world is a thing of the past for some people like your daughter; you should be glad about that.", "YTA\nUnsolicited advice is criticism. Always.", "YTA when people complain about stuff they\u2019re usually looking for some sympathy and not some advice. Only give advice if it\u2019s specifically asked for.", "You are not the asshole for trying to help. You are the asshole for ASSUMING she wants your help. Often times, women just want to vent; we are not looking for men to solve our problems.", "YTA- You have absolutely no idea what you\u2019re talking about. Nothing you described is in any way unprofessional. It\u2019s a male dominated industry, she doesn\u2019t need an old man with no concept of modern work life adding onto the stress of that. She has to deal with enough men who don\u2019t take her seriously. If she wanted your advice she would have asked for it", "YTA in general \n\nShe didn\u2019t ask for advice she just wanted to be heard", "YTA- please review the poem in this video called \u201cLike Totally Whatever\u201d by Melissa Lozada-Olivia \n\nhttps://twitter.com/huminbeen/status/1481644481770184707?s=46&t=zOEtFq55YMmeucEiZ1sCoA\n\nI also work in a male dominated industry and I wouldn\u2019t need to work if I had a dime for every time a man treated me the way they don\u2019t treat other men in the office.\n\nI\u2019m sure you meant well but men rarely have to deal with what women do.", "Woman here!\n\nYour daughter is right. Correcting the way she is speaking isn't going to help her get a promotion after  a year. The issue is 100% that she's being underestimated *because she is a female in a male dominated industry.* The fact that she's been working towards a promotion for a year speaks for itself. \n\nApologize to your daughter. I fo hope that she finds a company that actually values her.", "Woman in tech - YTA", "Being in the technology industry this was really hard to read. I can see why Dad wanted to jump in (but YTA for not waiting to be asked when you admit you're not familiar with the area).\n\nThe hard part is that, while the delivery was bad, some of the advice was good. It's OK to be flexible and accommodating and not domineering. What's deadly is the ums and likes - the words that tell your audience you were caught flatfooted, that can mark you as unserious. I know it's hard - I've spent years trying to resist the temptation to fill the uncomfortable silences while desperately trying to think of the answer. This isn't blame - no matter how much you know you can always be caught off guard. \n\nSometimes there are viable coping tactics - in a supportive team you should be able to admit to need to look it up/hunt for data etc - everyone does sometimes. But some people are a-holes. Not much you can do about them, generally, except move.", "YTA. Dad in tech here. \n\nI know we want to help our children and to do that I\u2019d suggest you first ask yourself, does my child want advice or sympathy? If you don\u2019t know, ask. Literally, you can say, \u201cwould you like to to support you by listening or offering solutions?\u201d\n\nAlso, your daughter is right. You don\u2019t know about tech and you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be a woman in tech. You also don\u2019t know how people speak to each other in tech, particularly engineers, and everything your daughter said seems perfectly fine to me. The fact that you jumped in to offer authoritative advice in an area where you have no experience is the definition of mansplaining. And when you found out you hurt your daughter\u2019s feelings, you seem to have made it about your fragile bruised ego rather than her hurt feelings. I\u2019m sure there are moment me when your child was hurt and maybe was a bit mean to you, and you responded with generosity and love. Why let your ego get in the way of being a loving parent now?", "YTA for not recognizing this as one of those times when a woman is venting about her job and not looking for advice. Also you don\u2019t know what goes on in her work even if you\u2019ve heard a few meetings.", "YTA. Im a female working in tech. Plenty of people speak informally or casually like this.  My female senior director in particular, who just got promoted to right under the COO, talks like this with some upspeak and fry voice. She's fantastic. Talks like a valley girl but also gets shit done and people like working for her.  You don't know anything about her career field so stop trying to tell her how to act. Men say stupid shit all the time, too, by the way and im sure you wouldnt question their ability to do their job.", "YTA for all the reasons everyone has already said. \nBut also please recognize that even when women speak in a \u201cconfident\u201d tone people will still underestimate them and disrespect them. For instance, I work in healthcare there are times I will see a patient with a male aide and my patient will assume the male aide is my superior and ask him questions instead of directing them to me even though I\u2019ve already introduced both of us and our roles. \n\nAnd, using \u201cum\u201d has benefits. Obviously there\u2019s a tipping point where it just becomes a distraction.

You were trying to help with some actually good advice and she has a right to be pissed because she\u2019s already telling you she feels underestimated by the men at her job and you probably came across as doing the same.

Maybe next time listen and SFTU. _If_ there is a next time.", "NAH, your advice sounds pretty on point, but your delivery sucked.\nShe's justified in being upset, but also overreacting.\nI think both need to work on clear and empathetic communication.", "NTA. You pointed out some things that make her look incompetent so she could see why she wasn't being taken seriously. She was overly dramatic because she didn't want to hear what she was doing wrong she just wanted sympathy. I don't care if you're a man or a woman , if I'm having a work related discussion with you and you decide to say \"umm\" and \"like\" excessively I think one of two things. 1) you're incompetent or 2) you have high anxiety and/or poor self-esteem so you're constantly doubting yourself. This does not make for a good leader. Someone who seems unsure of themselves should not be in a power place. You showed her what she could work on to get to that promotion. She'll get over it once she realizes how childish she's being.", "YTA.  \n\n\nYou don't know what it's like to be a woman in a male-dominated field. You can't offer her any useful advice regarding how to deal with systematic sexism.

When I (26f) was a teen, my dad would frequently interrupt me every time I said \u201clike\u201d or \u201cum\u201d, and his reasoning was I sounded more well-spoken without them. He trained me out of it and I guess he was right but it still sucked.\n\nAnd, in a very male-dominated workplace, I have to walk an edge of being professional but not \u201caggressive\u201d. It\u2019s exhausting. The occasional \u201clike\u201d or \u201cum\u201d slips in there. It\u2019s exhausting to have to self-manage and the last thing I ever needed was this kind of criticism coming from my own parent. \n\nGive your daughter a break. She\u2019s competent enough to manage her own career. Be a supportive person she can come back to rather than another voice of criticism.", "NTA. I completely agree with you but she didn\u2019t want to hear what you had to offer and that\u2019s ok too. She\u2019ll get the promotion eventually just probably not right now. That stuff is competitive as shit and she clearly doesn\u2019t see it right now. Her feelings aren\u2019t going to get her promoted. She will be ok though.", "NTA mostly. You were dassplaining which is a form of mansplaining. I agree that the points you made are likely valid in that they could be perceived as weakness in a professional world. But that's not what a daughter wants from her Dad.

You assumed that you knew what your daughter needed to be told rather than listening to her and taking cues from her on what she actually wanted to hear from you.

Daughter is ignoring my texts/calls. Here's what happened this morning:\n\nMy daughter (26) came by to visit. She's been working long hours for a promotion to the next level. She works in the technology sector. Her team is male-dominated and she's the youngest one there. She's been working towards this promotion for more than a year now and was visibly frustrated. She said she doesn't understand why she's not getting this promotion. Alongside this, she complained about feeling underestimated by her teammates and not feeling like they take her seriously.\n\nI was honest and told her she doesn't carry herself in a way that suggests competence. She occasionally works from home in my spare office and I've heard some of her meetings. She way too often says \"like\" and \"ummm\" as fillers, her sentences often end in the question tone when she means them as statements, and she is in general way too accommodating and a total pushover. Example: instead of \"That works\", she'll say something like \"that's like totally fine\". \n\nI get that it's normal for how twenty-something year old women communicate but I was trying to help my daughter by pointing out that this is hurting her. Well I got my head bitten off for trying to help. She accused me of \"mansplaining\" her own feelings to her when it's something I do not understand (because I've never worked in the technology industry before nor know what it's like to be a woman in a male-dominated workplace). She also told me I don't need to \"talk down\" to her and should instead be empathetic and support her in her own skin, as I (in her eyes) am telling her to change herself into a masculine personality to succeed whereas instead I should understand that it should be the norm that assumptions shouldn't be made about her competence just because she doesn't communicate as aggressively as her male coworkers. Somehow, what I said makes me a sexist and an unsupportive dad, and one that apparently she doesn't want to communicate with anymore.\n\nI was only trying to help. Honestly, I don't get her anger at me and this whole situation has left me quite heartbroken. I don't understand or maybe my own bias is getting in my way.\n\nAITA or is my daughter being completely unfair?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

No. No you wouldn\u2019t. Because you apparently think that the way men behave and speak is inherently right and there\u2019s no room for anything different.

I was just saying it\u2019s always better to ask what someone needs instead of assuming.", "I'm a bar manager and it's the same in that field", "Wow dude you just mansplained mansplaining.", "Lol\n\nFound the CEO of Forbes", "You wouldn't understand", "I'm glad that's been your experience. In far too many cases, mine included, it doesn't matter how competent you are. If you show up the men, you're done.", "That reallly depends on your boss", "If you have more females in leadership roles, you generally also have more leeway, as a woman, to, essentially \"act like a man.\" But when you're one of the only women in the room, and especially when you're the only woman in the room, you have to watch your \"tone\". I've lived it for over 30 years now.", "What sector do you work in?", "Kitchen supervisor, yep.", "I didn't explain mansplaining, are you requesting a definition?", "I\u2019m saying this very gently, but you might want to get some good independent career advice, from someone who doesn\u2019t have a vested interest in you personally. There is likely something holding your career progression back, and you likely don\u2019t know exactly what that is if you haven\u2019t been able to move forward.", "I'd be curious to know how many tech companies you've worked for. I was a consultant - some clients literally wouldn't listen unless a less-qualified male repeated my points. Other clients, perfectly happy with my services.\n\nWho you work FOR is the biggest determination of whether you'll get a promotion or not.", "While this is generally good advice for basically anyone who isn't progressing as they'd like or expect to in their career, I'm genuinely flummoxed as to how you don't think sexism is an issue in tech. I'm a young man, and I see it regularly. Guys getting promoted over girls who are much better than them. People asking for my advice and trusting me more than a woman who's clearly got more experience and knowledge. You really don't ever see that stuff?"]}
