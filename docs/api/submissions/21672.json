I pressed a few more times and said that was the most important thing I wanted the whole time. It was free. No expensive stuff. Just the moon and us on the beach.

So I laid over the balcony waiting and waiting. And big surprise, he went to bed again. I got upset and cried, again. Trying to explain how badly I wanted to do that with him. He said some very mean things while I sobbed and mocked me. He said I ruin everything and ruined this trip because nothing ever makes me happy. \n\nAITA for getting upset?

Create some rules around dating. For example do not define anything for AT least 3 months. You are dating that\u2019s it. After 3 months of just casually dating take a hard look who the person you see - you start to see who a person is beyond the person they want you to see around that time.

You\u2019re NTA.", "NTA....seems like you communicated clearly something importsnt to you. No hints...no weird mentions 6 months ago...but clear communication of something simple and quiet and nice. He missed out on an easy win.", "I noticed the age gap, but it\u2019s irrelevant to this issue because he\u2019s an asshole no matter what. My husband and I have a similar age gap but definitely not this dynamic.", "Yeah. I\u2019m 30 and I even get that, but she said she\u2019d been telling him about this for days. It was her birthday and most important for her. A guy can\u2019t rally or have a cup of coffee and just join her? Lame.", "OP, I've been old enough to see the moon and comment on it for 13 almost 14 years. I assure you, it's not silly.\n\nFull moons are, were, and always will be, to put it lightly, dope as hell", "He is mean, and not a good person.", "Was he really your knight in shining armor or was he the closest horse to take you away from the burning village?", "Probably a reason why he's still dating her four years later versus being married.", "it's not blame. it's a sad fact. OP asked \"why me\" and this is the answer - the abuse/abuser dynamic requires an asshole and someone who for whatever reason feel they have to settle for an asshole. it's why people like OP's boyfriend search out folks like OP who've been through hell already and are still emotionally fragile. \n\nbut the other facts are that she has independent housing, independent work and financial security, no children or other assets tying her to her abuser. she can choose to leave. her other comments state that she's stayed in spite of her boyfriend's actions up to this point because she believes he will change and things can improve. until OP not just realizes this is how he is and how he wants to be, but acts on it to leave (as again, i hope she does), she will continue to allow him to treat her badly without consequence.", "It is blame.  Call it whatever you want, but it's still blaming the victim.  Manipulation tactics work by making the victim unable to trust their own emotions/thoughts/needs.  \n\nHe saw someone who was nearly 20 years younger than him who was vulnerable and *decided to emotionally abuse her.*", "I'm a strong believer in the universe and it showing us our path. It's showing it to you right now, darling, and my heart is telling me that you are going to get through this. Soon, this AH will be nothing but a lesson to show you just how strong you are. Draw on your beliefs, hold yourself steady, and know there are a lot of us here for you. I've seen other commenters offer up their inbox and I'm doing the same. Please message if you ever need someone to listen. \n\nAlso ..... Do me a favor??? Give yourself SO MUCH grace in these next few months. Reading your comments it sounds like you've made some really hard and emotional realizations and you have some trauma that needs healing. Be gentle and graceful with yourself. There will be hard days, but there are going to be so many that are going to be better than you could ever dream of. It's all going to be worth it. \n\nPs. Speaking of nature - crows are my talisman. If you see or hear a crow in the next few weeks, just know you are being looked after. They're some of the best guardians.", "Hey, a reminder that working through stuff from your childhood (like \u201cdaddy issues\u201d) doesn\u2019t make you a bad person.

When you move on, you will learn that you have overcome the cycle of believing you deserve to be mistreated.", "Sweetie, leave this AH, try to heal, seek therapy. You seem like someone who sees the best in everything, who finds beauty in small things, who has joy for life. Those are great things, don't you let anyone tell you they're weaknesses. You'll find love (self love and/or romantic love) and you'll realize that this wasn't it. I know walking away is easier said than done but you deserve better, and we're all rooting for you here.\n\nDo share an update when you dump his ass.", "Why is no one talking about the age gap.", "NTA, but you are with grandpa do you should expect grandpa behaviour", "agree with everyone to get out as this is abuse!\ni\u2019m so glad you seem like (by your replies) that you\u2019re now understanding this and seem to be on the way to getting out !! im excited to see what he says / happens when he finds out you\u2019re leaving him so i\u2019ll follow to see if you share that :) good luck op!", "Honey you are 2 decades apart, He's at a different stage in life.", "I really don't see how *you* ruined *his* trip.\n\n> But I know I\u2019m not crazy, which is his favorite thing to call me.\n\nLeave him.

You do sound immature to sob over not getting what you want.  kt", "Tbh he sounds like a narcissist. And you're better off going no contact and healing yourself than to try to break it off with him.

Hell, there are people whose livelihood is to study celestial objects and are constantly finding new and wonderful things about our universe, *and* we're getting ready to once again send people *to* our moon! If enjoying the moon, spending time in nature, and capturing fireflies in my hand and letting them fly off on an early summer night as a grown-assed man makes me childish, then I'm happy to be childish. Life is too short for this kind of crap and you deserve someone who you can enjoy life with...", "He\u2019s emotionally abusive, sweetie. You deserve so much better! There is nothing childish about wanting to see the moon (esp on a beach). The one acting like a child is him & his behavior will prob get worse.", "sounds like emotional abuse? you said, \"But I know I\u2019m not crazy, which is his favorite thing to call me.\" \n\nthis relationship is not healthy.

There will not be money in this for you if you try to stick it out. It\u2019s time to move on. You have plenty of time to meet the right person.", "That's the abuse talking. You have done nothing to merit hate from anybody.", "I would definitely talk to your boss and let him know what's going on. You deserve so much better in a relationship.\n\nAnd if the BF has keys to your place, change the locks.", "> Typing this all out and reading it is very eye opening and upsetting because I\u2019ve allowed this *after* leaving an abusive marriage.\n\nAnybody can end up in an abusive relationship. The important thing is to recognize you're in one - you've done that! - and make an exit plan. \n\nBlaming yourself is counterproductive. I know it's easier for me to say than for you to do, but try to stop doing it."]}
