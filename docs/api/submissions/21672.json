At that day, we had already been to a few places and were in Jensen Beach Florida. We like to frequent nude beaches and establishments so I was stoked all the places we\u2019ve been. I had been mentioning for days about my birthday being on the biggest full moon of the year. The last one where it\u2019s as close to earth as it was that night. After we got back from dinner he got in bed and fell asleep. I tried asking a few times, \u201cHey, the moon is rising! It\u2019s amazing. Do you want to go on the beach?\u201d And I got ignored. I pressed a few more times and said that was the most important thing I wanted the whole time. It was free. No expensive stuff. Just the moon and us on the beach. I got ignored and told to grow the fuck up. Cried myself under the moon on a chair by the beach because I didn\u2019t feel safe enough to wander by myself. \n\nSo the 4th, the next day. He wakes up and says nothing, as usual. There are never apologies from him for anything. He finds that childish and says to be an adult and move on. We spent the day at a nude beach, so much fun and free. I try to pretend like he does that everything is fine. I mentioned a few times that the moon would still be bright and amazing that night, albeit not quite full but still, incredible. The moon rise was supposed to be at 9:59.  So I laid over the balcony waiting and waiting. And big surprise, he went to bed again. I got upset and cried, again. Trying to explain how badly I wanted to do that with him. He said some very mean things while I sobbed and mocked me. He said I ruin everything and ruined this trip because nothing ever makes me happy. \n\nAITA for getting upset? I am an emotional, deep feeling, very sentimental person and I know that can get the best of me from time to time. But I know I\u2019m not crazy, which is his favorite thing to call me.

Anyone who thinks apologies are childish is not mature enough to be in an adult relationship.", "NTA Regardless of how I feel about the moon or how safe wandering beaches are, it was important to YOU. He knew that. A caring boyfriend would have gotten his ass up and humored you for a walk for 15 minutes before going back to bed. \n\nMy husband and I have done plenty of things we don\u2019t like because we know it makes the other happy. I watch his terrible taste in movies with him. He goes on hot summer mini-hikes with me. Relationships are about compromise. \n\nAlso, mocking you for crying? Fucking dump him.

OP's partner is an AH, or maybe he just can't handle staying awake that long anymore?  I dunno, his bad, surly attitude combined with the almost 20 year age difference are major red flags.", "Why is he moving you and calling you crazy while you cry? Major AH energy\n\nNTA\n\nGlad you went and saw the moon on your own", "I\u2019m going to say NTA. You just want to look at the moon with him. The fact that he thinks it\u2019s childish is weird.", "NTA. Run from this man. The large age gap, him mocking your feelings and him not prioritizing the one thing you asked for on your birthday are massive red flags. His inability to apologize is screaming at you that he is not a well-adjusted, mature man. If you stay, just know this will be every birthday, every holiday and every trip. He is not going to change at this point.", "NTA but I\u2019m not sure you and your boyfriend are compatible.

You want apologies when he hurts your feelings and he thinks apologies are childish.", "nta - i think ur not compatible and why do u let someone talk to you that way telling and on top of it says over and over hurtful things?  thats mental abuse and then doesnt even believe in apologies? he is the one that needs to grow up.", "NTA but dudes old enough to be your dad and still doesn\u2019t give a shit about your wants \u2026 you need to evaluate your relationship.", "ESH. you for being so over the top about it. I don\u2019t think it was something to cry about. Him for just outright being dismissive.", "Yta fancy being such a crybaby and ruining the trip", "Yta. Grow up a bit.

He\u2019s almost 20 years older than you and he acts like he is 20 years younger than you. There is no hope for this man.", "NTA\nSome relationships with large age gaps work, this isn't one of them. He's so dismissive of your wants and blows your complaints off as being childish, what a jerk he is.

You deserve to be treated respectfully.", "I hit the nude beach every Summer and I would like nothing more than sharing it with someone special.

Not \u201cI want (insert expensive/unreasonable request here)\u201d or \u201cstop hanging out with x people so much because I said so\u201d; no, you just wanted to watch the moon with your partner, and apparently, that was just too big of an ask. Really?\n\nOP, you get that this is not a big request you made, right?

That\u2019s not okay and it\u2019s not what healthy relationships look like. \n\nAt the moment the way someone is talking to you can be described as \u201cberating\u201d it\u2019s time to call it. \n\nidk if you realize that like this isn\u2019t a good dynamic and it can be really hard to catch when you\u2019re in it especially when your self esteem is low but life doesn\u2019t have to feel this bad", "No \ud83e\udd7a I think he likes the appeal of the younger girlfriend but doesn\u2019t want to do any of the emotional work.

This was just the one thing on my birthday that was really important.", "Because of course it wasn\u2019t like this in the beginning. I feel totally duped on who he made me think he was and what he wants.", "This is an accurate statement. You have endured four years of this. Do you want the rest of your life to be this way? What if, as he gets older, he gets even more abusive? Love yourself, pick up your broken heart, and find someone that actually cares about YOU!", "Awe, I'm sorry. Maybe you should start thinking about your options, especially if you both live together.\n\nBTW, those were pretty moon rises earlier this week, though I saw them from Texas.", "Well he has shown you who he is now, so believe it\u2019s not going to get better.
