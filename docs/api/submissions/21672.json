I pressed a few more times and said that was the most important thing I wanted the whole time. It was free. No expensive stuff. Just the moon and us on the beach. I got ignored and told to grow the fuck up. Cried myself under the moon on a chair by the beach because I didn\u2019t feel safe enough to wander by myself. \n\nSo the 4th, the next day.

So I laid over the balcony waiting and waiting. And big surprise, he went to bed again. I got upset and cried, again. Trying to explain how badly I wanted to do that with him. He said some very mean things while I sobbed and mocked me. He said I ruin everything and ruined this trip because nothing ever makes me happy. \n\nAITA for getting upset?

We have worked together the past 3 years but I think I\u2019ve solidified my position without him so that\u2019ll help.", "He will only get worse.", "Did your parents treat you this way?  Do you love him, or is your brain trying to fix your childhood?", "You need out asap. The longer you stay, the more likely you'll be gaslit into staying forever, the more you're going to believe him on a subconscious level even years later, the more you run the risk of the red flags no longer registering and you end up in another abusive relationship. You also run the risk of him finding out your plans and ramping up the abuse. There's a bunch of abusers out there who will happily poke holes in condoms to make you stay. \n\nUnderstand that while you love him, he does not love you. Do you want to waste another moment with someone who doesn't love you? What he does love is making you feel distress. He enjoys your pain, how long until he finds out he loves causing you physical pain as well?", "You can love him without being his girlfriend. Clearly he doesn't value your feelings much. Time to move on.", "Are you sure he hasn't got a whole ass family in one of those houses?", "Someone that relishes the power they have over their partner is not safe.   Please reconsider this relationship once you're home.", "Lol, yes my dad was like this. The daddy issues are RAMPANT and so apparent, I hate myself right now.", "He used to! Not anymore.", "Yeah.  So.  That\u2019s not love.  That\u2019s a lie your brain is telling you because it recognizes this behavior.  Luckily you have a pre-frontal correct and you can tell the rest of your brain to STFU bc you deserve to be with someone who doesn\u2019t treat you like shit.", "Don't hate yourself. Love yourself enough to make a new life for yourself where you are cherished  as you deserve to be <3", "Regardless of how it feels, you don\u2019t have to let that define the rest of your life. I\u2019ve been there and know it can feel like a foregone conclusion, but you are capable of breaking this cycle. You deserve better, and better IS out there."]}
