I pressed a few more times and said that was the most important thing I wanted the whole time. It was free. No expensive stuff. Just the moon and us on the beach.

So I laid over the balcony waiting and waiting. And big surprise, he went to bed again. I got upset and cried, again. Trying to explain how badly I wanted to do that with him. He said some very mean things while I sobbed and mocked me. He said I ruin everything and ruined this trip because nothing ever makes me happy. \n\nAITA for getting upset?

You also run the risk of him finding out your plans and ramping up the abuse. There's a bunch of abusers out there who will happily poke holes in condoms to make you stay. \n\nUnderstand that while you love him, he does not love you.

I am someone who doesn't tend to do well in relationships or on vacations with emotional, deep-feeling, very sentimental people. That is not what's happening with your BF here.
