I pressed a few more times and said that was the most important thing I wanted the whole time. It was free. No expensive stuff. Just the moon and us on the beach.

So I laid over the balcony waiting and waiting. And big surprise, he went to bed again. I got upset and cried, again. Trying to explain how badly I wanted to do that with him. He said some very mean things while I sobbed and mocked me. He said I ruin everything and ruined this trip because nothing ever makes me happy. \n\nAITA for getting upset?

It's one thing that he behaved this way on your actual birthday. To do exactly the same thing the next night put it over the top. And everything else you've said pushes it into the stratosphere.", "Yeah I hate to say it but it sounds extremely abusive, it\u2019s only gonna get worse. Get out safely while you can \u2764\ufe0f", "This guy is pushing half as much older than you and has the emotional intelligence of a toddler.", "You are not silly for loving him. Have you ever read anything on trauma bonding? Him telling you to stfu, mocking you while crying, and calling you crazy (he's gaslighting you) is abusive. You deserve so much better than he is giving you. I wish you the best of luck.", "You're trauma bonded to him OP. It's not silly, it's common with abusive relationships. One I've experienced myself. I really hope you can get out safely. If you have the ability, find a therapist who focuses on DV.", "This is [emotional abuse.](https://www.thehotline.org/resources/what-is-emotional-abuse/)  He doesn't need to hit you for it to be abuse.  In fact, physical abuse doesn't exist without emotional abuse.", "Too emotional?\n\nLet\u2019s dissect this logically. You wanted a simple experience that was important to you. Something meaningful and powerful, that for you was the most important part of your trip. And it was easy! Trivial to support it. And yet he very deliberately avoided it, refused to do it when the time came, and then took a big steaming dump on its importance to you. And then when you tried to make it work out anyway, setting up an alternative, he refused that as well and once more deliberately put you down.\n\nThe only logical conclusion I can draw is that this man hates you. He hates how you are and wants to make you squeeze your needs into zero. Because you made it so very easy for him to do something nice for you, to give you the experience you wanted, and he refused and then mocked you.\n\nThat it would have been so easy for him to be kind to you makes the deliberate cruelty so obvious. And that is what is likely making you react so strongly: not that your actual want was so important, but that you know his refusal is because he\u2019d rather be cruel to you than do even the simplest kind thing. And it\u2019s entirely rational to be extremely hurt that someone you love treats you that way.", "So you already know and recognize the danger signs and that you're literally in another controlling abusive relationship.\n\nHeed your gut, and be safe. Get away from this giant AH.", "So you have a job and your own place, just leave. Stop trying to talk it through just say this isn't working and delete his number, change your locks if he has a key and just leave.", "He doesn't deserve you.  You need to cut him loose.", "Yes I know deep down this is a trauma bond. I\u2019m an anxious attached person. He\u2019s a dismissive avoidant. It\u2019s SO obvious and it still hurts.", "You mirror what I feel in my heart. \ud83d\ude13", "Don\u2019t hate yourself. Your parents trained you to have a warped idea of what\u2019s healthy and normal, and your brain is still operating on that. \n\nNow would be a very good time to pack up and leave. Yes, you think you love this guy, but there are other guys (and girls, and more) out there with love to spare, and many kinds of love as well. This guy clearly does not love you as much as you love him; he just wants to get his dick wet with you, and he would have no problem replacing you.\n\nThink of it like a job, if that helps: you don\u2019t want to give 110% and burn yourself out for a job that will literally replace you in less than an hour if you suddenly dropped dead. Loyalty goes both ways and if your job isn\u2019t loyal to you, they don\u2019t deserve any loyalty in return. \n\nSo leave. Join your local astronomy club. Find someone who actually shares your interests and doesn\u2019t think apologizing is somehow \u201cchildish.\u201d\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget to be open-minded about it! There\u2019s all sort of kinds of love and attraction: sexual, romantic, platonic, familial, aesthetic, etc. You might not find them all in one place or you might find them where you weren\u2019t expecting to. That love might not come in exactly the shape you expected it to, either.\n\nBut at the very least, you deserve better than a guy who does not love you the same way you love him.", "You might love your abusers but they don't love you, not really, not properly. They might show you a few actions that seem like love because they know they can't be 100% horrible to you 100% of the time, they will lose their victim if they are 100% horrible.\n\nOne of the things I believe about abusive relationships is that if you are not fed love on a spoon you will learn to lick it from knives. So much of your life is still ahead of you, you are worth love on a spoon.", "we marry / attach to our unfinished business, OP. you're drawn to him because you want him to give you what your own father couldn't. But this guy can't do it either.", "Please leave. And tell the people in your life what's going on. Abuse is very isolating and embarrassing. You have nothing to be embarrassed about, I promise you.", "Wow. That quote. I\u2019m writing that down. That hits home hard.", "I feel this is a karmic cycle for me that I\u2019m meant to break. It sucks. It definitely sucks. My love can\u2019t fix everything. \ud83d\ude1e", "He\u2019s very big on not telling people anything. Or overhearing anything. It\u2019s very important to keep up this facade. I\u2019m more real than that. And I know from my father that abusers typically like their secrets kept. Typing this all out and reading it is very eye opening and upsetting because I\u2019ve allowed this. AFTER leaving an abusive marriage."]}
