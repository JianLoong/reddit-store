You were concerned for your stepson and just took him to a doctor, it's not like you gave him meds without discussing it with your husband.\n\nTry talking with your husband about your responsibilities as Riley's stepmom?

Sleeping that much and still being tired are definitely concerning symptoms, and it\u2019s important to find out what\u2019s going on.

Tell him he's more than free to call the office and get an explanation on the doctor's concerns and what the blood tests will be looking for. You two are a team and that means you both have to be on the same page about Riley. You may not LEGALLY be his mother but you are a mother figure to him & you're not going to ignore problems in front of you.", "You are his stepmother even if he has the custody, you showed care for your stepson.

I had a stepparent growing up and they treat me like their own. I love it, they even eventually took legal custody over me incasr something happened to my other parent. On the flip side from a purely legal stand point. You have no custody over the child and the person who did explicitly asked you not to do what you did. As a person I think you did the right thing, from a purely legal nonpersonal stand point I don't think you have a leg to stand on.\n\nSo in short.

It could be something easily fixable like an iron deficiency, which can be easily managed by diet changes, but left untreated can impact growth and development.  \n\nPlus you didn\u2019t decide just on your own, you spoke to several family members.

In fact, some doctors will require a consent to be signed by the legal guardian (in this case the father). \n\nHaving said that, 13-14 hours is a lot. A three-hour nap is unusual for most kids that age. The fact that the teachers are noticing a problem is yet another reason to be concerned.

If I were you, my apology would be, \"I'm sorry I care more about your son than you do.\"", "No, your not an asshole.  But you would have been if you excepted any medicine for him.

Please update us when you get the results. I hope he's okay.", "NTA *Medical neglect: This involves carers minimising or ignoring children\u2019s illness or health (including oral health) needs, and failing to seek medical attention or administrating medication and treatments. It is the parents\u2019 responsibility to ensure that a child receives adequate health and dental care. If a parent or carer fails to provide this, it is classed as medical neglect.*\n\nDoes he want to be charged with medical neglect?\n\nMy daughter was very ill and the specialist scoffed and said I was making it all up. I kept phoning and phoning saying she was getting sicker and sicker, but they wouldn't bring her appointment with a different specialist forward who might actual run some tests. Said I was just wanting attention and there was nothing physically wrong with her. I got her in to see another specialist at a children's hospital in a city finally, travelling hours by train and they said she was dying and they were going to call the police and charge me with medical negligence. I told them to go get her file and they did and saw how I had been brushed off at every turn. They apologised to me seeing how I had done everything to get her seen, but the incompetence was on their end, not mine. A simple blood test would have shown the truth. I knew she had the same condition as her dad, but it was very nearly too late. It shows how you have to be very proactive for children, and do what is in their best interests.", "Your husband has a disturbing need to be right. So he is neglectful and even after a doctor says there are concerns and he gets angry because he may not be right.  Do you see this pattern in other areas?

I personally would not stay with someone who has such little regard for their own child\u2019s health.", "Even if you do not have custody of this child the law is firm. You are married to the childs father and therefore are financially liable for this kid. Its also obvious you are very involved in the raising of this child. Food for thought.

Your husband should be appreciative, not dismissive.", "I'm sure you already feel vindicated but I still say ESH. If Riley's mother was around SHE still wouldn't be able to take him to the doctor but you felt like you have that right? You absolutely don't. If you feel so strongly about having a say, adopt him. Riley is your husband's son, not yours.", "NTA.

It's criminal! Hopefully he changes his attitude.", "My father is like that, too. Unfortunately, that meant my asthma wasn't controlled, my narcolepsy wasn't diagnosed until I left home (also have central sleep apnea), and my clotting disorder wasn't discovered until I nearly died during surgery.\n\nI'm glad the child has you to look after his health, since his father doesn't seem to really give a shit.", "That really sucks. It\u2019s super important to be on top of health, and there are definitely some conditions that can do permanent damage if they aren\u2019t treated by a certain point. \n\nYou\u2019re absolutely doing the right thing and you have your step-son\u2019s best interests at heart.

I had concerns about my son too and his Dr essentially said with T1 they're usually VERY sick when first diagnosed but that doesn't mean your stepson is perfectly healthy. Iron or other vitamin deficiencies are VERY common in kids. Is he on meds for his ADHD? I know A LOT of people who have ADHD and are pretty constantly exhausted when not on meds. Being neurodivergent can take a lot out of a person, both emotionally and physically, and it could definitely be \"just\" that but you're not wrong for being concerned. My son ended up being ok but we have an appt with a pediatric endocrinologist anyway for baseline purposes due to a family history of T2 and me having PCOS & Hashimoto's."]}
