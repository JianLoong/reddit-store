You needed to act because you're the only other adult in your stepson's life who knows what he is going through. Your husband should be thanking you. Fingers crossed this is easy to resolve with something like iron supplements.", "NTA\n\nI would be concerned too. The fact that the doctor is concerned shows you are in the right. The question is - why isn't your husband concerned about his son?", "NTA. It\u2019s bewildering how negligent your husband is being about this. Not taking your kid to the doctor when something is clearly wrong could be considered abuse.\n\nKeep bringing that baby in until the docs find out what\u2019s going on and get him treatment. Are you absolutely certain that your husband treats Riley well? A big reluctance to visit the doctor may be an indication of guilt.", "NTA\n\nIf your husband doesn't want you to take responsibility for this kid, then he's not your stepson; he's your husband's son.

Your husband can't expect you to have a motherly relationship for this kid and then chew you out when youtake the initiative and responsibility for the kid. He can't have it both ways", "NTA.

When you have a concern, even if that concern isn't necessarily shared by your husband, you should be able to take the child to the doctor to have them seen. Obviously the doctor is very concerned here and ordered blood tests.\n\nI think you need to have a conversation with your husband about why he is so averse to taking Riley to the doctor? Is he worried that there's something wrong with his son, or has he had bad experiences with doctors? Is he one of those \"we don't go to the doctor unless someone's dying\" kind of people?", "NTA.

The doctor is concerned. You did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nI can see why people would say that is overstepping some boundaries considering he is not your son, but I have a hard time seeing someone who is acting out of genuine concern for a child's health as an AH.  It's too bad your husband isn't taking it more seriously.", "NTA - your stepson needed medical attention, why didn\u2019t your husband think to take him? I hope he\u2019s ok. You did the right thing.", "As someone with health problems that are linked to exhaustion and sleeping hard NTA theres so many things that could be affecting him and many have a point of no return.", "NTA. You were concerned for your stepson and just took him to a doctor, it's not like you gave him meds without discussing it with your husband.\n\nTry talking with your husband about your responsibilities as Riley's stepmom? It seems like you care a lot about him, and maybe even wants to have an active role instead of just being there. Since you met him when he was pretty young, Riley might want to have a deeper bond as well, but seems like your husband is stonewalling a bit", "Normally I\u2019m pretty against people \u201ctaking action\u201d with kids that aren\u2019t legally theirs, but it sounds like you tried to get your husband to agree to take his son to the doctor and he refused. Sleeping that much and still being tired are definitely concerning symptoms, and it\u2019s important to find out what\u2019s going on. You only took him to an appointment; you didn\u2019t do any tests or procedures without telling him. And frankly, although I sincerely hope it\u2019s nothing serious, you could have saved his life.\n\nSo yeah, NTA", "Even without the added context given by you in the comments I'm going with NTA. WITH the context absolutely NTA. \"No doctor unless we're dying\" isn't a healthy mindset for adults and does not work with kids who can go from small signs that need to be addressed to critical condition very quickly. Wanting to be superdad who isn't dependent on others doesn't work either\n\nYou did the right thing here OP. \n\nSit down and talk with your husband.\n\n\"I will apologize for not telling you, but I won't apologize for looking out for Riley's health.\" If he hasn't looked at the paperwork from the visit yet, hand it to him. Tell him he's more than free to call the office and get an explanation on the doctor's concerns and what the blood tests will be looking for. You two are a team and that means you both have to be on the same page about Riley. You may not LEGALLY be his mother but you are a mother figure to him & you're not going to ignore problems in front of you.", "You are his stepmother even if he has the custody, you showed care for your stepson. What's wrong with it? It's him who should apologize to you. NTA", "NTA. It could be nothing, it could be something. If it is something, pretty much everything benefits from early detection. You sound like an awesome stepmom, and kiddo is lucky to have you!", "Nta i think he should be pleased you are looking out for your stepson. Not that i want there to be something wrong but in a way i hope they find something as that might solve this for you", "NTA\n\nYour stepson and his son but it seems like you are the primary carer so you deserve decision making authority.\n\nNot to mention it looks like you are right.", "Info:  what his nighttime sleep schedule?  A kid his age should be sleeping 10-11 hours a night.  My kid sleeps for 830p-7a and he's 10.", "NTA - Your husband was neglecting his sons health and you did the right thing. Only person who owes an apology here is your husband to his son and you.....", "ESH as much as I don't want to say it. You are looking out for the kid and I applaud that. I had a stepparent growing up and they treat me like their own. I love it, they even eventually took legal custody over me incasr something happened to my other parent. On the flip side from a purely legal stand point. You have no custody over the child and the person who did explicitly asked you not to do what you did. As a person I think you did the right thing, from a purely legal nonpersonal stand point I don't think you have a leg to stand on.\n\nSo in short. I think you were right in what you did and would do it again but you should still probably apologize.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You were just looking for information, it\u2019s not like you secretly gave him medicine. \n\nNaps, and falling asleep in the car, are normal in any age for a child, but that long? Is concerning. It could be something easily fixable like an iron deficiency, which can be easily managed by diet changes, but left untreated can impact growth and development.  \n\nPlus you didn\u2019t decide just on your own, you spoke to several family members.

Morally and ethically, I think you are in the right. \n\nHowever, legally, I'm not so sure.

In fact, some doctors will require a consent to be signed by the legal guardian (in this case the father). \n\nHaving said that, 13-14 hours is a lot. A three-hour nap is unusual for most kids that age. The fact that the teachers are noticing a problem is yet another reason to be concerned. And while some causes are relatively benign, others are indicative of serious problems. \n\nHow about this for an apology: I'm sorry I went behind your back to potentially save your child's life. I'm really sorry your child may have a serious condition requiring medication and treatment. I'm sorry you think your pride and ego and being right are more important than the health of your child (even though you were wrong). \n\nI hope that he can get his head out of his butt and start thinking about the health of the child first.
