You were concerned for your stepson and just took him to a doctor, it's not like you gave him meds without discussing it with your husband.\n\nTry talking with your husband about your responsibilities as Riley's stepmom?

Sleeping that much and still being tired are definitely concerning symptoms, and it\u2019s important to find out what\u2019s going on.

Tell him he's more than free to call the office and get an explanation on the doctor's concerns and what the blood tests will be looking for. You two are a team and that means you both have to be on the same page about Riley. You may not LEGALLY be his mother but you are a mother figure to him & you're not going to ignore problems in front of you.", "You are his stepmother even if he has the custody, you showed care for your stepson.

I had a stepparent growing up and they treat me like their own. I love it, they even eventually took legal custody over me incasr something happened to my other parent. On the flip side from a purely legal stand point. You have no custody over the child and the person who did explicitly asked you not to do what you did. As a person I think you did the right thing, from a purely legal nonpersonal stand point I don't think you have a leg to stand on.\n\nSo in short.

It could be something easily fixable like an iron deficiency, which can be easily managed by diet changes, but left untreated can impact growth and development.  \n\nPlus you didn\u2019t decide just on your own, you spoke to several family members.

In fact, some doctors will require a consent to be signed by the legal guardian (in this case the father). \n\nHaving said that, 13-14 hours is a lot. A three-hour nap is unusual for most kids that age. The fact that the teachers are noticing a problem is yet another reason to be concerned.
