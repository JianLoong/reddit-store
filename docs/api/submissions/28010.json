And not everyone who is abusive is mentally unwell.\n\nAll this \"be the bigger person\" and \"reach out to her\" is nonsense.

Honestly reaching out to her and trying to be the bigger person isn't going to do anything for her and it's just going to further expose you to her abuse and harassment, because that's what it was like when you were in contact with her. Unless she is getting help I think no contact is good contact", "NTA I'm assuming she doesn't have the brain capacity of someone younger than 4 here. Because even 4 year old know you can't call people horrible names because it's mean. \n\nAs someone who suffers from CPTSD anxiety and depression I can tell you being mentally unwell is no excuse.

The reason people tell you to \"be the bigger/better person, is because you are the victim. The perpetrator won't or can't undo the harm they did; so everyone turns to you, the wronged person, to grant absolution. Because only you can do that, especially absent any contrition or attempt at making amends. You hold the power, don't give it away, don't forgive the unforgivable. And don't forget, that only opens you to further damage.\n\nAnd anyone who takes the abuser's side has chosen that side.

Congratulations on being the only one in your family who understands healthy boundaries.", "NTA. She is abusive. You should not have to try to make amends with someone who has hurt you in the past and continues to harm you on social media. She needs to get over herself and stop treating you that way.

My husband has these issues with his mother before he completely cut her out. She wants you to make the first move (as in reach out and apologise) because that maintains her status as \u2018The Victim\u2019 which is crucial to some narcissists sense of self. By ignoring her, you are not allowing her to \u2018win\u2019 which is likely what fuels the vitriol online. Perhaps, if you haven\u2019t already done so, look into some therapy and a therapists which specialises in navigating narcissists. \n\nNTA in a million years", "NTA block her, and tell anyone who wants to give you info on what she says, posts, or does to save it.

She hasnt drunk anything in about a year but still posts nasty things on facebook about me atleast 4 times since her last drink", "I appreciate hearing from someone in a similar situation and im very sorry theyve done that. I guess lately as ive been getting older and my friends go out with their mums often and have really strong relationships with them, i get sad that i dont have that. The closest i have is my gran (my dads mother) and i wont have her for much longer. So i consider reaching out to my mum but then when i go on facebook there will be new posts about me being awful for not talking to her (again she has never. Not once reached out to me.) And i think about all the nasty stuff she told me growing up, and the letter she sent me when my father and her split (i was still talking with her before the letter, but she sent one to me telling me she hopes i die alone, and that was what made me cut all contact)  and the fact that ive been in and out of therapy for years and suffer from ptsd.

The only thing ive heard about the posts was a few years ago a old bff of mine who moved away when we were little contacted me as she thought i was dead and got a shock when i posted something.
