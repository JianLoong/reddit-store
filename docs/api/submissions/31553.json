We\u2019ve never gone this long without talking and I just didn\u2019t truly believe it wasn\u2019t about me at all because I also was not invited to further family and friends outings after our conversation and didn\u2019t understand why. \n\nI asked him if the accident was affecting him so much maybe we should take a break for his benefit even though I love him and would not want that but if that was best for him then I would support him anyways but he got angry and said that this was just another thing I\u2019m putting on his list of worries and left. \n\nIve left messages apologising for the bad timing and my intrusive thoughts but basically no answer, hasn\u2019t answered any of my calls and hasn\u2019t tried to contact me at all.

There are rare times for some people when their own psychological survival and working through their issues in their head is 100% encompassing and they truly have no capacity left for others until they get themselves straightened out.  If he is going through something like this then it honestly has nothing to do with you.  He will get through it in time, but it is entirely up to you if you want to patiently wait it out to see what happens or if you choose to spend this time more independent of him ... more on your own.  We can't force others to open up to us, we just learn to live our own best lives in spite of their closures.  NTA.", "NTA.\nIt\u2019s okay to voice your concerns. You don\u2019t bug him with your worries constantly.\n\nYou can try and accept that he doesn\u2019t want to be in contact with you. And just wait for the time when he will be more open for communication.\n\nIf not, I think it\u2019s okay to leave this relationship if it\u2019s draining you and makes you feel only worse.", "If he wasn't contacting anybody it could be just that he needs time and everything but the fact that he seems to be only ignoring you and not his family or friends is weird. Maybe we don't have all the info but I don't see what stop him from just answering you that he needs time and just do basic communication so that you wouldn't worry... so I would say NTA but if I was you I would wait for him to contact you first for now on... maybe he needs space and you already apologize once", "Sorry, but I couldn't put up with being treated like this for this long. You're his gf. He's your bf. You're supposed to be there for each other. If he won't let you be there for him or support him without any sort of explanation, I wouldn't give him any more of my time. All he has to say is 'look, I'm going through a bit of a bad time, I promise it's not you, but when I'm ready to talk about it, I will'. The fact that he's now ignored you for five days is a red flag for me. I'd be messaging him saying,'Look, I know you're going through a bad time, but if you keep ignoring me, then what's the point? I'm not going to wait around.' Just my opinion. How long are you going to keep letting him ignore you? What if, in a few weeks, he's been ignoring you for a month? That's not ok.", "NTA - while I understand the trauma, him interacting with others except you shows he\u2019s to me he\u2019s emotionally no longer invested in this relationship, but won\u2019t break it up because it\u2019s the thing he\u2019s used to. I\u2019ve been in relationships like that and have both been the person who got shunned and the person who did the shunning, so I\u2019d say move on after having a proper chat about it, without you apologising about things. You shouldn\u2019t be apologising for being honest with how it\u2019s making you feel and any loving partner will understand that and not get angry.\n\nAlso a side note: feeling insecure because your partner is cold is not \u201cintrusive thoughts\u201d.", "NTA but girl, he\u2019s completely ignoring you. Maybe he is going through trauma but you are a person and don\u2019t deserve to be treated this way. You\u2019re reaction is correct. If he is this upset but can still socialize with everyone else than maybe he\u2019s too overwhelmed to be in a relationship. I\u2019d tell him you\u2019re sorry for what he\u2019s going through but he seems too overwhelmed to be in a relationship right now so you are taking a break and you hope he gets the help he needs.

In fact, I'm working on it.  Been through a couple of similar events in my own life, unfortunately.\n\nBut let's break it down to basics.  A girlfriend can fill a couple of different roles.  She's obviously your lover, but can also be your friend.  If she's your lover, you may or may not care to hang out with her when you two aren't dating.  If she's your friend, then she is providing you with more than just sex.  \n\nYour boyfriend's reaction to the traumatic event is to push you (GF) away from him.  Wow, that speaks volumes about how he views you, specifically.  You are not his friend.  In fact, it is a bit of a chore for him to deal with you, outside of dating.  (Read:  he was previously making minimum effort to try to maintain the relationship so he would have access to sex.  But now, he can't keep up the charade as he doesn't have the patience or energy to do that, not even for access to sex.)\n\nTo put simply, he's just not that into you.  You are entertaining to him, in a sexual way only.  But now, he's just not in the mood for sex.  And after what he's been through, it is understandable that he wouldn't be thinking much about sex.\n\nBut that means his sex toy is now on the back burner.  Sorry....", "NTA.", "He\u2019s resolving trauma. He needed your support and you  gave him drama", "YTA. Leave him be. You have already been arguing for weeks. Why would he want to continue that esp. after a traumatic experience?\n\nMen often don't like to talk about their feelings. We like to think about them by ourselves first - ALONE - for a while until we come to a decision/ understanding or need to get a question answered. \n\nWhen he is ready to talk to you, he will.\n\nSo DON'T contact him anymore (not even to apologize, to say that you understand, or that you will wait for him).\n\nLeave him the F*CK ALONE for now. \n\nThe more that you continue to contact him, the farther you are pushing him away - possibly permanently. You've been warned! (By both of us.)", "Yta a person should not be expected to reassure you continuously through out there recovery and crisis. It's unfair for you to think so", "Gonna have to go with NAH\n\nOP did nothing wrong. The bf hasn't either, he's been thru a traumatic event and is suffering.

You say, \"Honey, I need some time to myself for a while\".  Contrast that with what OP describes.  Guy's not making any effort at all to communicate in any manner.
