Never.", "My husband and I do the same. \u201cStay right there, I\u2019m getting wet paper towels and the flashlight\u201d because we\u2019re always barefoot. \n\nIt wouldn\u2019t occur to us to criticize.", "It is. It made me feel like garbage. It reminded me of my family having really strong negative reactions. When I tell him those stories he says they\u2019re awful but he basically did the same to me today", "Yeah I wouldn't want to get glass on my feet especially in the shower \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05", "This is some \"move out when he's at work tomorrow\" shit, ngl", "Leave.", "I really don\u2019t think you should mention it. Can you quietly get past him with the keys and leave? This man is abusive. And confrontation is a huge reason for physical abuse, unfortunately. If you can get out of the house and away from him, you could call him and try to discuss his clear abuse. But if this isn\u2019t the first time, then physical abuse is likely next. So I can\u2019t recommend confronting him at all. It\u2019s way too risky. It sounds dramatic, but you can even call the non emergency police in your area to get an escort out. You\u2019d just say you feel unsafe and are afraid of violence if you try to leave", "Agreed, leave and then you can text him and list the incidents as a pattern of abusive behaviour that you can\u2019t accept. He\u2019ll try to gaslight you or get you to come back, but tell him it\u2019s not up for discussion other than to arrange a time for you and at least one other person to come get your stuff.", "Reading that this isn't the first time I'm going to suggest that you have a very gentle conversation with hI'm now, and make a plan to leave without telling him asap.\n\nIt will only get worse", "This is never ok and, reading your other comments, also borderlines on abusive. \n\nSomething deeper might be going on with him? Idk but right now he's treating you like shit and I'd leave if he doesn't change and start communicating like a grown up", "Please leave", "Yeah, idk if you missread or meant to answer to post above but I don\u2019t think your an asshole for an accident. I also drink in the shower so.. not a very impressive reaction by your bf.", "Touch\u00e9 HAHA", "You don't have to be with someone like him for a sake of being with someone. You need someone who doesn't get angry at you for silly reason when they make a bad mistake too.\n\nThis sounds like a controlling behaviour on his part. \n\nIt's perfectly fine to make a mistake but also you  need a partner who doesn't get angry at you for it.\n\nAnd you're sitting outside the bedroom while he was the one who's done wrong, can you see the picture?", "She is an alcoholic. This was her falling off the wagon after a couple of months of sobriety. She's been posting about her struggles with alcoholism for the better part of a year. This wasn't a one off. This was an announcement of her return to bad decisions. She was drinking in the shower to hide her activities.\n\n She is trying to minimize the nature of the incident as all alcoholics do.\n\n She said that \"It was only two shots\" multiple times, which I don't believe. Those of us with alcohol issues will always undersell what we are doing. Always. \n\n\"I bring glasses filled with water into the shower all the time.\"  No, you don't. Water is literally pouring on your head. Your hands are busy washing and covered in soap and shampoo. If someone brings a beverage into the shower it is always alcohol. \n\nStop twisting yourself into knots trying to white knight a cute girl on the reddits. She has a problem and this was an emblematic return to those problematic behaviors. One slip up isn't a reason to give up on sobriety. But this is confirmation that she can't handle drinking. Her boyfriend responded because she was fucking up again.", "Yeah. And I know for a fact he won\u2019t even mention it unless I walk into the room and bring it up first", "That's not normal and you shouldn't be apologising for a mistake.\n\nHe should be apologising for the unnecessary anger. And he won't because that's how he keeps control and say it's your fault instead of cleaning the glass and making sure you got out unharmed and saying nice things to you like 'It's ok, be careful'.\n\nI made mistakes but my now husband never got angry with rage at me and slammed the doors for mistake so small, that's why I have a hard time reading this and seeing you trying to talk to him first when he was in the wrong."]}
