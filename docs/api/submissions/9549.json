Especially if that friend has been asked to stop, but then continues.  It is a reasonable boundary if both parents agree.

Your child is a little bit young to completely understand family relationships especially when we get into cousins and aunts and uncles anyway....He will still be ego centric and that will continue until about 4.5. It is difficult for him to view relationships outside of his own perspective....So a test we do for this is we ask a child how many babies/children does mummy have (normally in sibling families) and a older child will include themselves in the count but a younger child will not..and this kind of understanding is not like a light bulb it develops over time. \n\nBut you have created a boundary and it should be respected.

You can call them Mr. Smith, Mr. Steve, Coach Steve, etc.  Auntie and Uncle are honoraria reserved for very few and bestowed by the family and indicate to the child that the adult is as close as family and have a position they can trust.  Outside the family you can\u2019t name yourself Uncle, it has to be conveyed by the parents.  My kids only had a couple, and they remained as close as family throughout their lives. Vacations, emergency contact at school, etc. The relationship is not just with a parent, but with the whole family, and continues for a lifetime. \n\nWhere does \u201cUncle Stevie\u201d fall in this spectrum? Cultures are different but I\u2019d shut it down unless you trust him like your own siblings to care for your child.", "YTA.

If the kid called him that voluntarily that would be one thing but Stevie is pushing this title.", "ESH\u2026.Stevie should respect the boundaries that you guys have given. It is disrespectful of him to keep doing it when you\u2019ve asked him to stop.\n\nHowever, you\u2019re reading too much into it with the uncle thing. Growing up, any good friend of my parents was \u201caunt or uncle so and so!\u201d It wasn\u2019t confusing at all. I knew that I had my actual aunts and uncles who were siblings of my parents, and I also knew we called the adult close family friends aunt and uncle as a term of respect and love. Your kid will understand it as he grows up. He\u2019s three now\u2026I doubt he cares about the difference between a blood uncle and a friend uncle. He just knows it as \u201cthe nice fun loving guy!\u201d Lighten up!", "ESH. I\u2019m a firm believer it takes a village to raise a child. If I had someone like Stevie in my life (on my or my partner\u2019s side), I\u2019d be thrilled that they want to be in my child\u2019s life. So you\u2019re the AH for making someone who doesn\u2019t *need* to give a damn about your kid, feel like they aren\u2019t family (clearly he is to your wife since they\u2019ve known each other since childhood). But at the same time, Stevie is an AH because he isn\u2019t respecting your guys\u2019 boundaries. You can\u2019t just show up unannounced. Perhaps you\u2019re frustrated with Stevie, as you should (for him making *your* home, his). Is it possible you\u2019re taking the \u201cuncle Stevie\u201d a bit too far because you\u2019re already annoyed at his behavior? Think about it.

You can teach your kid that words mean things and ALSO call him uncle Stevie. Both things can happen. It\u2019s incredibly common to call a lifelong best friend uncle or aunt.

I do think he needs to respect your boundaries, and it\u2019s completely out of line to keep it up after being told over, and over, and over again.  I think you\u2019re wife just knows him so well she can just brush off the things that bother her. It\u2019s annoying and it irks you, but it doesn\u2019t really seem the kind of thing to make a huge deal out of.

It\u2019s you and your wife\u2019s house so whatever you say should go.", "NTA and here's why.  A lot of people  seemed bogged down in the fact that growing up they used the term for aunt and uncle on no family.  That's great! I do too for my child.  But OP is not TA for not wanting to do that.  It's an incredibly simple boundary that is weirdly being pushed by this friend.  Asking someone to not call your child something or not have your child refer to them as something is up to the parents not an outsider.", "**NTA.**\n\nBoth you and your wife have requested Stevie stop labeling himself as an Uncle. He continues to so, so Stevie is TA. But, I think you're looking too much into it if you think it's going to confuse your child.", "ESH. He should respect your boundaries but it\u2019s kind of silly that you want your son to prioritize biology over actual relationships. If your son holds this guy in the same regard as his bio uncles, what\u2019s the harm in that? Your son won\u2019t be confused by the relationship if he refers to him as uncle. In my culture, you usually call your parents close friends aunt or uncle. It was never confusing for me even when when I was as young as your son. I always understood that my \u201cAunt Susan\u201d was my mom\u2019s sister and my \u201cAunt Rose\u201d was my mom\u2019s best friend. I had all of these awesome people around me that loved me and would do anything for me regardless of whether we share the DNA. I still cherish those relationships to this day.", "ESH. You for assuming \"uncle\" is just for people who are married into a family and your wife for dismissing your feelings by saying \"whatever\". You should both sit down and have an adult conversation about it.", "ESH. I think this is a weird hill to die on. I'm an only child. My best friend is an only child, and my other good friend has one brother who lives a few states away. We are all 'uncles' to each other's kids. Personally, I think the more love a kid has in their life the better and you should be thankful he wants to be close. However, the fact you and your wife are on the same page and asked him to stop and he didn't means he also sucks. If one of my friends asked me not to say it anymore I would for sure stop. I'm also confident they would stop if I asked. Ultimately, it's your decision and so from that perspective, he is the bigger AH than you even if I think you should still embrace it.", "ESH. \n\nHe should respect boundaries even if they're silly. \n\nBut this boundary is ridiculous. In many cultures around the world \"Auntie\" and \"Uncle\" is used for all three use cases of 1) biological ones, 2) your parents' friends, and 3) your friends' parents. Those kids all figure it out. Do you really think your kids are just dumber than all those other children?", "How does your wife feel? I think you need to have a conversation with her about it and also I think you\u2019re over complicating it. \n\nI had lots of uncles and aunts growing up. Some were blood and some were friends. I was able to understand the difference but loved them all like family. Heck my aunt and uncles who weren\u2019t related to me often loved me more and supported me more then my \u201cblood\u201d aunt and uncle. \n\nSo ya YTA. Friends can be aunt and uncles too. Give your kid more credit. You can\u2019t have too many aunt and uncles in my personal opinion who want to help  and be there for them", "NTA. Some people are saying this is a petty thing - maybe it is. But it's YOUR SON and it's meaningful to you. Furthermore, I come at this from the perspective of a real Uncle...\n\n...my sister gave birth to a baby boy 14 months ago to the day. He's the joy of my life and I'm so thrilled to have the opportunity to be his Uncle. I try to get over to see him as often as I'm able, and I love every moment of it. I have two younger sisters, so I've never had another little guy in the family, and it's everything I ever thought it would be.\n\nMy BIL has a friend who's very close to him. He and his wife refer to my sister's son as \"our nephew.\" Now I get it - I really do. It's a term of respect and endearment to a close family friend. But I feel like they shouldn't be on the same plain as me when it comes to this child. They shouldn't be getting equal billing. He truly is MY NEPHEW. You said you have three brothers; on their behalf, you should try to put a stop to Stevie's antics.

I had an Aunt Judy growing up because she was close friends with my mom. I grieved her death to Covid as if she were family because she was. Blood doesn't make you family. Love does. \n\nIt's sad you don't want your child to know that.", "Lots if cultures use uncle or aunt as a term of respect for adults that they\u2019re not related to, you could just not care? Your kid will eventually learn the typical meaning of uncle with time anyway", "This arguably could be a good way to teach your child the contextual use of language but that might be a bit too advanced for a 3 year old. But I think your position on it is reasonable.", "Like the person you responded to said, you should ask your wife and follow her lead on this one. She\u2019s the one who has been long time best friends with him. It\u2019s not worth you fracturing their friendship for something so minor. If she agrees with you then I\u2019d suggest either she approaches Stevie or you approach him together.", "OP said his wife told him \"whatever\", and that he is overreacting. Sounds to me like only one parent (OP) wants it to stop, and the other (OP's wife) doesn't actually mind.", "I\u2019m not overlooking that, no. I\u2019m saying the *stated reason* behind *why* they are making that request, imo, makes them assholes.\n\nIf OP said \u201cit makes me uncomfortable\u201d. Different story. But OP acted like this is going to harm his child\u2019s understanding of vocabulary, which is BS.", "I\u2019m not the only one with this opinion\u2026go screw with someone else. I think OP is an AH for pressuring his wife into this weird thought process. I stand by my statement.", "Like of course he\u2019s not going to listen to a boundary his friend isn\u2019t actually setting lol. To be fair it\u2019s a dumb boundary to set.", "That\u2019s not really the issue in question though", "I noticed two things in this comment--the use of the words \"disrespecting\" and \"undermining\"\n\nPretty big words to use for a voluntary term of endearment?  Look, it's clear that you feel really strongly about this--to the point it doesn't make a lot of sense. usually when that happens, ppl really have more deepseated feelings about the issue at hand and the more surface level issue (\"I don't like that my kid calls so-and-so 'uncle'\")  is just a proxy for some other feeling that you have.\n\n\"Stevie means well but he's never been good with boundaries.\"\n\n\"he came over unannounced again \"\n\nreally i sense this is about a larger issue at hand about you/your family's relationship with this person. i'm guessing that if you had another family friend equivalent who your kid was calling \"uncle\" you'd have no prob  with it.\n\njmo.", "I'm many places \"Aunt and Uncle\" are simply terms of respect for someone who is older than you. \n\nAlso, if you're going to be so closed off in teaching your kids that family is blood & paper only, then sad for them. And you.", "This isn\u2019t about respect either. Go check your feelings at the door. Your kid can learn uncle stands for its literal and non-literal uses, this isn\u2019t the hill to die on. Go talk with your wife instead of moaning on Reddit.", "It doesn\u2019t seem to bother your wife. It seems to bother *you*. Especially after she told you you\u2019re over reacting. Parenthood is hard. Lack of sleep can totally change how you handle situations. In this world of ours, it doesn\u2019t matter who your *blood* relatives are when it comes to love. Your kid will know who\u2019s a *real* (biological) family member. In fact, I think I have even more love for the aunts and uncles in my life who aren\u2019t biologically related to me. That\u2019s real love - to not have any requirement to be in my life, but to be there because you *want* to.", "Calling themselves \u201cuncle\u201d isn\u2019t pretending to be someone\u2019s uncle. He\u2019s not taking anyone\u2019s place. Clearly his wife feels this way otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have told OP he was overreacting.", "We have friends where the wife falls into culture like that. Everyone is Auntie or Uncle. I would be surprised if their daughter knows what my name is because since she could learn to speak, I have always been \u201cAuntie\u201d as well as any other woman is her life outside of her mom and grandma.", "Seems to be. It also seems op doesn't like that her bff just shows up unannounced. Seems like there's other issues than just being called uncle and \"messing\" with vocabulary. Seems like a boundary issue and op needs to talk to his wife about it.", "Or that someone doesn't know what \"no\" means.", "Which means it has to stop.", "I agree with what you are saying. But, I think the totality of the situation also needs to be considered. We wouldn't even be here if Stevie just honored the parent's request regarding their child.", "To me, the reason doesn't matter. It's their home and their child.", "So you're just overlooking the fact that **both** parents have asked for Stevie not to refer to himself as Uncle?", "> Go check your feelings at the door.\u00a0\n\nWhat does that mean?  My interpretation is \"Your feelings don't matter.\"", "If you aren't an uncle and you call yourself that, I'd say it is.", "I think you're right that there's other issues, whatever they might be", "True, but the reason behind that request doesn\u2019t really make much sense, and doesn\u2019t really seem fair. This person is clearly very invested in this child\u2019s life and loves this child. Referring to himself as uncle Stevie is just a reflection of that- and the parents aren\u2019t okay with it because they are worried about his vocabulary.. which seems dumb to me.", "The reason behind the request does matter when it comes to determining if they are AH\u2019s for making said request, imo.", "No, both parents did not really ask lol. Asking while clearly not caring, and saying \u201cwhatever\u201d is not actually asking.", "It means nobody is trying to hurt his feeling in this situation. No level headed person would be upset by this.", "Vocabulary isn't the only reason though. OP also mentions there the child has three biological uncles as well - maybe the parent's want those titles specifically for the brothers. Again, completely reasonable. And, again, Stevie should just honor their **reasonable** request.", "No, in their home, they can set whatever rules they want for whatever reason they want. They can insist a guest wear a colander on their head if they come over. They wouldn't have many guests but they wouldn't be AH's, just weird.", "OP specifically says that him and his wife have both asked Stevie to stop this.\n\nDad:\n\n>I've asked him to stop that so he learns what Uncle means\n\nMom:\n\n>My wife agrees and has asked him to stop but when he doesn't listen she just says whatever.\n\nAre you saying if somene initally tells you no, it's ok to keep at it until they say yes or whatever?", "That's an interesting claim.  But from what I've read, the guy kept saying it *after he was told to stop*.", "Vocabulary is the only reason *OP* stated, and I\u2019m going to go off that instead of other hypothetical reasons.\n\nI don\u2019t feel OPs reasons (the ones he actually shared with us) make this request a reasonable one.", ">No, in their home, they can set whatever rules they want for whatever reason they want.\n\nThey can, but I\u2019m still going to think they are AH for it in this situation. \n\nI\u2019m gonna say this is an \u201cagree to disagree\u201d conversation.", "No I\u2019m saying that the wife didn\u2019t actually ask lol. She\u2019s Stevie\u2019s friend. She clearly doesn\u2019t actually care.", "You missed the part where his wife told him he was overreacting too? Piss off and quit arguing with me about no point.", "We have to agree to disagree. I think it's completely reasonable to limit Aunt/Uncle to family only. Especially for your own child.", "Fair enough. You do have that right.", "OP says she has asked - 3rd Paragraph.\n\n>My wife agrees and has asked him to stop but when he doesn't listen she just says whatever.", "Nobody's making you be so rude."]}
