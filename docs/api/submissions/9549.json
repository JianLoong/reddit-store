Your child is a little bit young to completely understand family relationships especially when we get into cousins and aunts and uncles anyway....He will still be ego centric and that will continue until about 4.5. It is difficult for him to view relationships outside of his own perspective....So a test we do for this is we ask a child how many babies/children does mummy have (normally in sibling families) and a older child will include themselves in the count but a younger child will not..and this kind of understanding is not like a light bulb it develops over time. \n\nBut you have created a boundary and it should be respected.

You can call them Mr. Smith, Mr. Steve, Coach Steve, etc.  Auntie and Uncle are honoraria reserved for very few and bestowed by the family and indicate to the child that the adult is as close as family and have a position they can trust.  Outside the family you can\u2019t name yourself Uncle, it has to be conveyed by the parents.  My kids only had a couple, and they remained as close as family throughout their lives. Vacations, emergency contact at school, etc. The relationship is not just with a parent, but with the whole family, and continues for a lifetime. \n\nWhere does \u201cUncle Stevie\u201d fall in this spectrum? Cultures are different but I\u2019d shut it down unless you trust him like your own siblings to care for your child.", "YTA.

If the kid called him that voluntarily that would be one thing but Stevie is pushing this title.", "ESH\u2026.Stevie should respect the boundaries that you guys have given. It is disrespectful of him to keep doing it when you\u2019ve asked him to stop.\n\nHowever, you\u2019re reading too much into it with the uncle thing. Growing up, any good friend of my parents was \u201caunt or uncle so and so!\u201d It wasn\u2019t confusing at all. I knew that I had my actual aunts and uncles who were siblings of my parents, and I also knew we called the adult close family friends aunt and uncle as a term of respect and love. Your kid will understand it as he grows up. He\u2019s three now\u2026I doubt he cares about the difference between a blood uncle and a friend uncle. He just knows it as \u201cthe nice fun loving guy!\u201d Lighten up!", "ESH. I\u2019m a firm believer it takes a village to raise a child. If I had someone like Stevie in my life (on my or my partner\u2019s side), I\u2019d be thrilled that they want to be in my child\u2019s life. So you\u2019re the AH for making someone who doesn\u2019t *need* to give a damn about your kid, feel like they aren\u2019t family (clearly he is to your wife since they\u2019ve known each other since childhood). But at the same time, Stevie is an AH because he isn\u2019t respecting your guys\u2019 boundaries. You can\u2019t just show up unannounced. Perhaps you\u2019re frustrated with Stevie, as you should (for him making *your* home, his). Is it possible you\u2019re taking the \u201cuncle Stevie\u201d a bit too far because you\u2019re already annoyed at his behavior? Think about it. Maybe y\u2019all just need to assert those boundaries and whenever he pops up just say \u201csorry, we weren\u2019t expected visitors. Let\u2019s plan another time.

You can teach your kid that words mean things and ALSO call him uncle Stevie. Both things can happen. It\u2019s incredibly common to call a lifelong best friend uncle or aunt.

I think you\u2019re wife just knows him so well she can just brush off the things that bother her.

It\u2019s you and your wife\u2019s house so whatever you say should go.", "NTA and here's why.  A lot of people  seemed bogged down in the fact that growing up they used the term for aunt and uncle on no family.  That's great! I do too for my child.  But OP is not TA for not wanting to do that.  It's an incredibly simple boundary that is weirdly being pushed by this friend.  Asking someone to not call your child something or not have your child refer to them as something is up to the parents not an outsider.", "**NTA.**\n\nBoth you and your wife have requested Stevie stop labeling himself as an Uncle. He continues to so, so Stevie is TA. But, I think you're looking too much into it if you think it's going to confuse your child.", "ESH. He should respect your boundaries but it\u2019s kind of silly that you want your son to prioritize biology over actual relationships. If your son holds this guy in the same regard as his bio uncles, what\u2019s the harm in that? Your son won\u2019t be confused by the relationship if he refers to him as uncle. In my culture, you usually call your parents close friends aunt or uncle. It was never confusing for me even when when I was as young as your son. I always understood that my \u201cAunt Susan\u201d was my mom\u2019s sister and my \u201cAunt Rose\u201d was my mom\u2019s best friend. I had all of these awesome people around me that loved me and would do anything for me regardless of whether we share the DNA. I still cherish those relationships to this day.", "ESH. You for assuming \"uncle\" is just for people who are married into a family and your wife for dismissing your feelings by saying \"whatever\". You should both sit down and have an adult conversation about it.", "ESH. I think this is a weird hill to die on. I'm an only child. My best friend is an only child, and my other good friend has one brother who lives a few states away. We are all 'uncles' to each other's kids. Personally, I think the more love a kid has in their life the better and you should be thankful he wants to be close. However, the fact you and your wife are on the same page and asked him to stop and he didn't means he also sucks. If one of my friends asked me not to say it anymore I would for sure stop. I'm also confident they would stop if I asked. Ultimately, it's your decision and so from that perspective, he is the bigger AH than you even if I think you should still embrace it.", "ESH. \n\nHe should respect boundaries even if they're silly. \n\nBut this boundary is ridiculous. In many cultures around the world \"Auntie\" and \"Uncle\" is used for all three use cases of 1) biological ones, 2) your parents' friends, and 3) your friends' parents. Those kids all figure it out. Do you really think your kids are just dumber than all those other children?", "How does your wife feel? I think you need to have a conversation with her about it and also I think you\u2019re over complicating it. \n\nI had lots of uncles and aunts growing up. Some were blood and some were friends. I was able to understand the difference but loved them all like family. Heck my aunt and uncles who weren\u2019t related to me often loved me more and supported me more then my \u201cblood\u201d aunt and uncle. \n\nSo ya YTA. Friends can be aunt and uncles too.

Furthermore, I come at this from the perspective of a real Uncle...\n\n...my sister gave birth to a baby boy 14 months ago to the day. He's the joy of my life and I'm so thrilled to have the opportunity to be his Uncle. I try to get over to see him as often as I'm able, and I love every moment of it. I have two younger sisters, so I've never had another little guy in the family, and it's everything I ever thought it would be.\n\nMy BIL has a friend who's very close to him. He and his wife refer to my sister's son as \"our nephew.\" Now I get it - I really do. It's a term of respect and endearment to a close family friend. But I feel like they shouldn't be on the same plain as me when it comes to this child. They shouldn't be getting equal billing. He truly is MY NEPHEW.

A 3 year old can understand their own relationships and is starting to understand their family's relationships. But although they can parrot back \"Angie is mom's sister\", they have no understanding of what that means. \"Sister\" only has meaning if they have a sister of their own, and that means something different to them based on... their relationship with their own sister, and how many kids have a sister, and if they know where babies come from and can identify that as meaning the same mother and father. It means something different based on if they know anyone who has been adopted, or if they've seen any shows/movies with a nun in it or been to a church where people say \"Sister Mary\" talking about other parishioners. And a million other things. They genuinely don't care. They get the basics, and they disregard the rest as one of a million things they'll understand when they are older.\n\nAnd when they are old enough to actually understand all of that, they are old enough to understand that \"Angie just likes to be called Auntie because they are friends like sisters are friends\".\n\nI also won't go into all the cultural things, and how common it is for children to use these honorifics very loosely, because you've had all those comments... they're right, but that doesn't have to be *your* culture. \n\nAnyway... the goal is to resolve the problem, and your wife isn't going to cut Stevie out of her life, so something needs to change to resolve things.

Boundaries that Stevie could ignore: mean-spirited teasing, discipline, naps, things like saying \u201cit\u2019s okay\u201d when Tommy is hitting and biting, forcing a nickname.", "Is anyone actually harmed by the child referring to Stevie as \"Uncle Stevie\"? Real harm\u2014not \"OP thinks that biological family is the only kind that deserves labels.\" Learning that people who are not your blood relatives can also be considered family seems like a nice thing for a child.", "[removed]", "Lol of course! Because as we all know it's one step from wanting to be called uncle by a child you love and lying and cheating and stealing! He's gonna poison the child's mind against the parents I just know it!", "You're just describing every normal Uncle ever.", "I guess I don't get the whole coming over unannounced thing. Back home people just kinda stopped by all the time and it was never a big deal, it was always just a pleasant surprise. But I guess maybe most people didn't grow up that way?", "Yes that's possible as well.\n\nIn which case, my vote would be for them to follow the two yes one no rule.", "So screw him. Stop having him over. If your wife wants to make plans with him, it's probably better off going out.", "Ah so once again, the ~~Iranian yogurt~~ Uncle label is not really the issue here.\n\nYour real problem is you don't like Stevie and your wife seems to not want to continue the friendship in its current form. This has nothing to do with the \"Uncle Stevie\" thing\u2014though I encourage you to think more deeply about the family labels thing, because teaching your child that family is not limited to blood relatives only is really valuable.", "This is one of those agree to disagree things.", "Yes. Everyone is overlooking that for some reason. Wife says \u201cwhatever\u201d because she is probably tired of fighting but that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s suddenly ok.\n\nOP is NTA", "I\u2019m gonna agree to disagree :)", "Oh. Yeah, no. You're not winning that battle any time soon. Expect to find skid marks for at least another 2-3yrs, unless you plan on checking him every time he goes potty.\n\nThank you for the clarification!\n\n(edit: generally kids are able to reliably wipe their own butts clean by 5. Some take as long as 6 or 7, but if they're struggling to wipe after age 5, you probably need to do an after-potty check each time)", "And lots of cultures don\u2019t do that. Why is one \u201cworse\u201d than the other? I\u2019m totally cool with families/ cultures that use the aunt and uncle titles to refer to their elders, but mine doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s okay too.", "This. It's not up to anyone but the parents to decide others' relationships with the kids and I'd be willing to bet the people who dispute this are the people who don't have kids.", "IF the kid calls Stevie \u201eUncle Stevie\u201c it would be OK. But Stevie is trying to make the kid call him Uncle. And that against the wishes of the parents. That is a big no-no", "Wow, way to go off the rails here. The parents have asked him to stop. He needs to respect them. I don't see anything awful about what they are asking. They are his parent, after all.", "Yeah, that's not a ridiculous strawman argument...\n\nIt's not that complicated. When dealing with a child, listen to the wishes of the child's parents. If Steve isn't willing to follow their reasonable boundary, then who knows what other boundaries of the parents he'll choose to ignore.", "As an introvert that sounds like a nightmare to me.  But you're right, I didn't grow up that way.  Maybe if I had it would be more like a surprise phone call?", "I guess it could get pretty annoying. Life\u2019s busy when you work and have a small child. Having someone come over when you least expect it can be pretty annoying if you just want to relax, decompress, or just spend some quality time with your family. I think it can be a super cultural thing too.", "Yea no were adults don't come over unannounced or you'll be standing on the porch.", "Sounds to me more like she wants him to stop, but not to the point of having to actual enforce it.", "Ok", "Completely agree.", "Well of course you wouldn't. And it's not so much as there's anything specifically wrong, it's just that they are being obnoxious assholes. Imagine if someone insisted you.not where red shirts around their child. Like, sure you can do that but you're an asshole for it and all that will result in is no one wanting to be around you or your kid. Which is exactly what's gonna happen here. They will alienate everyone so they can micromanage every tiny thing that touches their precious child and the child will grow up to be another insufferable coddled asshole we all have to deal with.", "I did, and I didn't mind it even into my 20s when I lived alone. But now- no. I have a lot going on and I'm not always ready to be \"on\".", "Yeah back home people just walk in and yell \"knock knock\" without actually knocking. Then you offer them beer.", "Bingo!", "I suspect OP might not be as accepting of gay people as he\u2019s let on.", "I wondered when that would pop up as well.\n\nMy first thought was that the OP pointed out that Stevie was gay so Reddit would not immediately jump to the conclusion that the wife and Stevie were having an affair.  After being on here for a while, it is sadly a real possibility.", "The point is to determine whether somebody is an AH, not whether they have the right to do something. You can have a rule that you will fart into every visitor's face every ten minutes as long as they're in your house, but you can't tell me that you're not an AH for having that rule.\n\nIn fact, by your own logic, most of the questions in this subreddit are meaningless, because most people have the absolute right to be AHs most of the time.", "Actually, there is a codified set of behaviors in society known as etiquette, so there actually are rules of behaviors, norms if you will, that determine right in certain situations, like asking guests to wear colanders."]}
