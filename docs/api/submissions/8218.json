Do you know much about the culture?\n\nI once did a dance in traditional Korean attire and received comments less about the beauty of the culture or craft and more about how the outfit was \"sexy in a traditional way\" or how the dance was \"alluring.\" At the time I was taken aback, why would you objectify my culture, the attire, the dance, me... But after some time I realized that some people don't know the significance of the dance, or the attire, or the cultural aspect behind it all. For some of those people, they were paying a compliment with what they knew/saw. While it would have been nice for them to have provided compliments more suited to the context of the performance, I now know that they weren't coming from a place of malice. I get the feeling it was the same for you.\n\nAgain, without more information it's hard to say, but I would say soft YTA.\n\nI would suggest doing some research into the dance/attire, understand where she's coming from.

When someone has worked really hard at something, amateur or professional, commenting on their bodies is the wrong way to go about showing respect and appreciation for their effort.

It might've came off sleazy when you said she was hot at the time, so it's understandable if she got mad.\n\nI assume you're just a normal guy and not a professional critique, being called YTA and a fetishist for a normal, well-intentioned remark toward a significant other must be depressing. lol", "NTA\n\nThis is a very close one IMO.

It wasn\u2019t a dance recital but rather a religious ceremony.", "He was invited to watch one of her recitals, not attend a religious ceremony. Stop trying to misconstrued the situation to fit your own narrative. Not all of us understand ever culture. And I\u2019m sure this applies to you as well. \nHe should have known this? Maybe she didn\u2019t take the time to educate him on the cultural/religious significance. \nI\u2019d guess his comment did not come from a place of malice.", ">I think everyone is just gotten sensitive because a dance or some other culture was involved.\n\nThis. Like I said in my own comment, no one would bat an eye at calling a paramedic hot in their uniform.", "I\u2019m happy that someone level headed like yourself commented. I\u2019m over here scratching my head, totally confused at all of the people calling him disgusting etc.\n\nIndia has some of the most beautiful clothing (colours, fabric material and designs), and it\u2019s clear that OP isn\u2019t from the same background, so this could be new to him. Add on top the fact that she\u2019s dancing, and very good at it too. I do agree that there could have been \u201cbetter\u201d ways to compliment the performance, but this doesn\u2019t seem THAT out of line to me. \n\nAlternate scenario:  \n-Boyfriend: *wears a suit to an event  \n-Girlfriend: \u201cYou look super hot!\u201d  \n-Boyfriend: \u201cThanks!\u201d *feels all special and complimented.  \n-Reddit: \u201cyea, I love a man in a suit. It\u2019s super hot!\u201d\n\nThis scenario:  \n-Girlfriend: *wears beautiful and hella expensive outfit from her background/culture, leads a talented dance group, and dances extremely well  \n-Boyfriend: \u201cthat was great, and you looked super hot in your dress!\u201d  \n-Girlfriend: \u201care you serious?!\u201d, and then ghosts him.  \n-Reddit: \u201cYOU DISGUSTING PIG!!\u201d  \n\nI\u2019d be willing to bet that if a classical Indian dancer lead a dance crew and did an amazing job, and her INDIAN boyfriend saw her performance for the first time, and then said she looked hot in her traditional outfit, that no one would bat an eye. This page is crazy. Are we only allowed to be turned on by our partner if they are of the same race?", "100% agreed. Thank you for being a reasonable person. I\u2019m a drummer and a lot of times when I perform, my wife tells me that she thinks I looked hot/sexy, and not once did I feel anything other than complimented. \n\nI get that some people are trying to explain the background of Indian classical dancing, and why it shouldn\u2019t be viewed as \u201csexy\u201d, but I must have missed the part where OP said he was a mind reader, because everyone seems to believe that he should have obviously known these things.", "I can only speak for myself, obviously, but I\u2019ve been in this situation. \n\nIf we get dressed up to go out and my bf says I\u2019m hot, I\u2019m flattered. \n\nIf my bf watches me perform a piece I\u2019ve choreographed, practiced, agonized over, injured myself for, and finally delivered, and his feedback is that I look hot in a leotard, I\u2019m bummed. It\u2019s not offensive to be considered hot, but it\u2019s really disappointing to feel like he can\u2019t see my art past my butt.", "Op has no experience with that dances? With appreciating things? Human movements?", "i honestly think its a \u201cdifferent strokes for different folks\u201d deal rn. like if i worked really hard on something, for example if i was still doing martial arts and worked on a sparring routine, and my partner said \u201cit was great! and you looked really hot in your Gi\u201d id be really flattered and id take it as a compliment. or for a cultural example, if id been working really hard to put together a c\u00e9ilidh and creating/managing dance routines and music stuffs, id still be flattered if my partner said \u201cit was great! and you look really hot in your kilt.\u201d some people will view certain things as a compliment, while others think its not appropriate.\n\nalthough OP is still TA for not knowing his girlfriend well enough to know which way she leans. or at least not saying a whole bunch of things about the dance itself before saying that he thought she looked good", "Read the post again. He did. He said the show was great.", "Uh... he did?\n\n> I told her it was great and that I thought she looked super hot in her traditional attire.", "The dance recital IS considered a religious ceremony. I am not trying to misconstrue anything. This is not my POV. This is how it is. \nDude calm down! Are you the OP shit-posting from another account lol.\nHave a good life buddy.", "But that isn't what OP thought. Even if it was dumb thing to say, it's better he said what was on its mind then some  fake script.", ">although OP is still TA for not knowing his girlfriend well enough to know which way she leans.\n\nWhat if it's only a new relationship?", "I agree with you", "I would need more context because if the dance is something that is regularly objectified or sexualized I could see why she is put out. The examples you gave, I haven't seen too many people sexualize a gi. (A kilt yes but then you get into how different genders react to being sexualized in cultural attire)", ">or at least not saying a whole bunch of things about the dance itself \n\nIf you aren't into dance in general, there's not a whole lot you can say about a performance. OP doesn't strike me as the kind of person who goes to dance recitals regularly, so his grilfriend is probably all he could comment on.", "I do understand your point and it definitely does seem to vary from person to person. But I would like to point out that there is a difference between practicing martial arts and a dance from your cultural heritage. \nDunno just seems kinda like fetishizing the culture, so I understand why she is upset.", "I\u2019m a pro, and have run my own dance company for 30 years. Traveled and taught. Education of those kind of people is KEY", "Not exactly the same, but i had the same issue when I did some pole classes! A few friends and i found a place that offered non-members $10 classes and we thought it'd be a fun way to spend time together and get a good workout. I told a man about it once and never again.", "He literally says in the original post that he thought the dance itself was great. It IS possible to compliment both the work and the appearance of your spouse.", "He also said he thought she looked \u201csuper hot\u201d in her traditional attire.  I don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t say she looked super awesome and left it at that instead.", "If you\u2019re making the argument that it was good that he was honest so that she knows to break up with him, then I can kind of see your point I suppose.", "id still think he\u2019s TA since thats something you learn early on. now dont get me wrong, this isnt a \u201ci hope she dumps your ass and runs!\u201d level of AH, he just needs to apologise and explain that he didnt realise she\u2019d be upset. like this is a very mild YTA situation, but yeah unless its like <1 month in and they completely skipped the dating phase id still say hes slightly TA and needs to apologise", "i mean you can still say \u201cit was awesome!! i really liked (specific part) and (other specific part)! honestly you looked great out there\u201d", "thats why i included the c\u00e9ilidh example too, since thats something heavily engrained in my culture. some people view a comment like that as \u201cyou are attractive and im letting you know you look good\u201d while others take it as \u201cim sexualising you\u201d. i 100% understand why she\u2019s upset, i just dont think OP is like a huge raging AH. he is still an AH, just more mildly", "YTA. That was probably a culturally or religously significant dance,", "More like watching your SO perform in a play, say you thought their performance was great and they looked hot doing it.", "Yeah. Like it's all good knowing the right thing to say. If you don't mean it, it's kinda pointless to say."]}
