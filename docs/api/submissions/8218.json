This makes the \u201cyou looked hot in that attire\u201d comment a double yikes.\n\nAlso, I guess your girlfriend felt that you didn\u2019t pay attention to her dance moves or anything related to the dance itself but jumped only to a description of her looks. Gentle YTA though", "You didn't compliment her techniques or amazing skills she presented. You went straight to complimenting her body. If you don't learn why this is an issue, then you will continue to put your foot in your mouth more often than not.\n\nYTA", "I feel like there's some information missing to this, like how long have you guys been dating? Do you know much about the culture?\n\nI once did a dance in traditional Korean attire and received comments less about the beauty of the culture or craft and more about how the outfit was \"sexy in a traditional way\" or how the dance was \"alluring.\" At the time I was taken aback, why would you objectify my culture, the attire, the dance, me... But after some time I realized that some people don't know the significance of the dance, or the attire, or the cultural aspect behind it all. For some of those people, they were paying a compliment with what they knew/saw. While it would have been nice for them to have provided compliments more suited to the context of the performance, I now know that they weren't coming from a place of malice. I get the feeling it was the same for you.\n\nAgain, without more information it's hard to say, but I would say soft YTA.\n\nI would suggest doing some research into the dance/attire, understand where she's coming from. If she gives you a chance to talk, be genuine in your approach, 'Sorry for the insensitive comment, I'm not familiar with dances and attire that have so much history and cultural significance. It didn't occur to me that my comment was so insensitive,' etc. You don't sound like an awful person, you just made a mistake.  It's all a learning experience in the end. Best of luck.\n\nEdit: \"..., just a mistake\" whoops, no, meant to day you just made a mistake, sorry!", "YTA.\n\nThe traditional regalia is beautiful.

Acknowledge her hard work and grace", "YTA\n\nI don't know anything about her culture so I cannot venture to say if you crossed any sort of religious or cultural line by addressing her body, but something I do know that translates across all cultures is that:\n\nWhen someone is a *professional* at something...Ah scratch that. When someone has worked really hard at something, amateur or professional, commenting on their bodies is the wrong way to go about showing respect and appreciation for their effort. I don't know a darn thing about dancing but I do know that, \"Hey girl, you're a real hottie in your traditional attire,\" is the wrong thing to say after a recital.", "INFO: How long have you two been dating? If you\u2019ve only just started, she might think you\u2019re fetishizing her.", "YTA - Are you serious? She\u2019s a traditional dancer, you\u2019ve offered no insight into understanding the meaning or significance of the dance but just said she looks aesthetically pleasing while doing it. It would come off as completely insensitive to her culture and art form.\n\nEdited to add: You're also solely complimenting her looks which is how society often measures the worth of women. It\u2019s okay to be attracted to your partner but go deeper than just her looks in these moments, a cultural dance isn\u2019t really the appropriate time to sexualise her.", "YTA.

Perhaps she'd have been happier if you acknowledged the dance itself or her performance, you know the thing she actually made an effort at.  Instead, you only see her as hot which pretty much says how you value her.  \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nUnless the dance is part of a sexual roleplay (eg belly dancing for your partner in private), saying that a dancer look hot in their clothes is a shitty compliment.\n\nThink you did a huge thing at work, and all your partner has to say is not about your skills, not about your achievements, but that you look hot in a tux.", "YTA\n\nYou went to a recital where your girlfriend was the lead dancer.\n\nWhen asked how it was you complimented her appearance instead of her dancing.\n\nIt's not difficult to understand how badly you fucked this up.", "Kind if a toss up for me but I'm leaning toward YTA because it sounds fetishizing if the first comment you make is that she looks hot in traditional clothing. Even if that was not your intent, words matter.", "I mean, it's probably a bit culturally insensitive. I imagine it would be like telling a female church singer that her dress made her look sexy while she was singing worship songs. YTA, but it's an accidental asshole.", "YTA the dance and outfit weren\u2019t for you to sexualize and you did - that\u2019s super disrespectful. Apologize.", "YTA you're not only sexualizing her art but also her culture which is extremely cringey behavior. Hopefully you didn't mean to do that but understand that's probably what you did and the best thing to do would be to apologize & ask her how you mad her feel in order to clear the air.", "Based on her reaction, YTA. That was probably a culturally or religously significant dance, you're outside of the culture and you made a crass comment.", "YTA. Fetishization is gross and so are you.", "INFO what is the cultural background of the dance? I'm assuming religious cus shes Nepali. If you dont know YTA", "Yta. And probably single.", "NTA \n\nUnpopular opinion but she's your gf.\nI'm not sure why it's offensive to tell your gf she looked hot.", "NAH. You did tell her you thought the dance was great and wanted to compliment her too, or her attire. Nevertheless, the intention was a simpleminded one. You should still apologize that you upset her and that your phrasing was crude, and that you were genuinely impressed and captivated by the overall performance. It might've came off sleazy when you said she was hot at the time, so it's understandable if she got mad.\n\nI assume you're just a normal guy and not a professional critique, being called YTA and a fetishist for a normal, well-intentioned remark toward a significant other must be depressing. lol", "NTA\n\nThis is a very close one IMO. Your girlfriend either is having an insecure moment or was too awkward to tell you she thinks you made a faux pas.\n\nWhich you obviously did, somehow. I think it was the combination of being especially romantically forward in your comments and her being dressed in foreign attire which may draw stereotypical \"hot exotic girl\" comments. I would be interested to know if you are Caucasian, although frankly I think anyone of a different mainstream race could fall into that trap.\n\nI believe at age 25 it is reasonably expected that you should be aware this is a possible misinterpretation and take steps to avoid it or catch yourself in real time and correct yourself. However if you're already in a relationship with someone, telling them that they look sexy is something you're *supposed* to say.", "NTA.\n\nThe problem here is, and honestly it isn't a problem, just perception. Complimenting her outfit doesn't automatically mean you disregarded her efforts or the significance of the dance, if that part is in play here. Although the outfit can be a fetish, it isn't really anything wrong.\n\nShe may have probably thought that, due to hot often being considered a sexually oriented compliment, as assumed by the multiple people here. I suppose you could try and talk it over with her, and explain your stand regarding the compliment.\n\nKeep in mind that everything I am saying is assuming you did see the dance as art itself and not just fetishized the entire thing.", "Find someone who isn\u2019t going to be offended over a compliment. Too many chill people who don\u2019t live to be mad about dumb stuff. I\u2019m Latina and I\u2019ve dated guys with different cultures and none are cringe like your gf regarding compliments and they\u2019ve assumed I eat/make tacos lol.
