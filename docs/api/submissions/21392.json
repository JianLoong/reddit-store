There is literally a compromise to solve the issue, but the granddaughter just decided she doesn't want to? I don't believe her not wearing headphones is for comfort and is probably just being a jerk since she doesn't like the DIL. Do you want your granddaughter growing up thinking it's OK to be a jerk and not compromise just because she doesn't like someone? \nI think you would be TA if you have someone staying in your home and then not let them get sleep because someone is playing video games. Not getting sleep is torture. Also, the granddaughter has her own room!", "YTA\n\nThis is not about your GD's comfort, you are enabling their poor behaviour.\n\nYour GD is doing this because she does not like your DIL and wants to make her life difficult. If it were about staying up late gaming they would agree to wear headphones or take the console and TV to their room to play, but that would not have the desired effect of annoying your DIL.\n\nYou are doing your GD a massive disservice by teaching her this behaviour is acceptable and she can always have what she wants even if it is hurting others.\n\nOP do YOU like your DIL because it sounds like you also want to punish her.", "YTA\n\nIf I\u2019m getting this correct, you have two rooms- one where your 2 sons are staying and another where your granddaughter is. Your DIL is on the couch in the common area.\n\nYou should have been more insistent with your granddaughter. She has her own space, she can game there. Also, DIL\u2019s request for headphones was very reasonable. \n\nFrom your post it doesn\u2019t seem like DIL has caused any issues, and you\u2019ve already mentioned that your granddaughter hates her. It\u2019s just basic manners to not trouble someone at odd hours. You should teach granddaughter to be better imo. You\u2019re not shaping your granddaughter to be a good human, depending on her age she should either have basic decency by now or be taught some.", "Yta\n\nDon't have guests in your home if you can't treat them like guests.  \n\nYour gd sounds spoiled and entitled.  You aren't doing her any favors by making her think she should always get what she wants.  \n\nYour gd has all day to play games.  She can stop playing at night and maybe think about others for a change.  It's okay to not like someone, but it's not okay to be rude to people you don't care for.  Is this how you want her to act when she grows up?  People don't magically change when they become adults.", "YTA...if your granddaughter can't give up her room, then the living room is off limits after hours. Why punish your DIL? Surely she deserves some BASIC comfort.", "YTA.  You\u2019re phrasing this in a deliberately deceptive way to make yourself sound better.  This isn\u2019t your granddaughter\u2019s comfort vs your DIL\u2019s comfort.  This is about allowing your granddaughter to be deliberately rude and obnoxious to your DIL, which is obviously enabling bratty, bad behavior.  Your granddaughter has a whole other home she can go to if your DIL\u2019s presence is so irritating to her.  Don\u2019t let your granddaughter be an asshole.  You know better, you\u2019re just being as petty and nasty as your granddaughter.", "YTA and your granddaughter sounds like she\u2019s headed in that direction as well. She refused a very reasonable request (headphones) and instead of explaining to her that we all sometimes have to adjust for others you just sort of shrugged.

They are family and You make sacrifices for family. Not to mention your elders. But I digress) she forfeited the ability to play games all night. The way I see it there are two reasonable solutions:\n\n1) you impose a gaming curfew; she either can\u2019t play or has to wear headphones after a certain time\n2) she relinquishes her room so she can play as late as she wants \n\nRegardless of her feelings towards her step mother this was a reasonable and respectful request. You have yet to give us details about how your DIL treats your GD. So we can\u2019t make a proper conclusion. You mentioned that it must be obvious there is a problem if she stays with you during her father\u2019s time. Could it be grandparents are way more lax with rules and she knows she can get away with things she can\u2019t at her dad\u2019s house?\n\nYou raised a son who allows his parents to raise his affair baby and now you are creating another trash human being.

The solution to being called out after asking if you are the AH is to abruptly kick them out. Obviously its a complicated situation with your son being an AH and your DIL choosing to stay with him anyway.\n\nUnfortunately I can see where he got it from and you're teaching your granddaughter the same toxic ways of being. Surely you can manage to reality check and find a way to do better?\n\nYTA", "Hang on - so your solution to this is to kick out your son and DIL when you have made an agreement to help out because your GD, when she stays with you, will not wear headphones?\n\nI rescind my E S H and am opting with YTA. You are blooming awful. All over the solution for a pair of headphones.", "YTA. Why are you letting your kids dictate sleeping arrangements in your own house? And why do you enable your granddaughter\u2019s poor treatment of her stepmother?\n\nYour edit makes you look even worse. The answer is kicking out your son and his wife rather than pull your granddaughter into line? Wow you are an AH.", "I understand that you want what\u2019s best for your granddaughter. And it must hurt that she is not accepted info the family by DIL as much as you would like to see.\n\nHowever, by allowing your GD to ignore a very reasonable request, you are setting her up for future failure. Basically it\u2019s acceptable for her to refuse to listen to you AND it\u2019s acceptabel for her to put own wants before someone\u2019s sleep. Putting headphones on so you don\u2019t bother someone would be considered  common decency. \n\nIs this REALLY the person you want her to be?

You may not like your DIL, but allowing your GD to torment her is not going to help anyone. You are just adding on more tension and hostility to an already bad situation. It sounds like your GD is playing at the living room because she wants to irritate your DIL, and you allowing (possibly encouraging) that is unhealthy. She is a child and while she might be right about her grievence, it is part of your job to direct her towards healthier coping mechanisms. I assume you love her and want her to grow up to be a happy adult, so teach her how to make the best of a tough situation. Don't make things worse for her.", "Yta, you dont like your dil so you are allowing your gd to learn not to be considered of people that are staying there. \n\nYour logic is that if they failed to show me respect then I don\u2019t have to be a basic host and considerate. Like example ive had issue with my mil so I shouldn\u2019t have to accommodate her at all? \n\nPlus your \u201csolution\u201d is to kick them instead of having your gd wear headphones is extreme.

Your granddaughter sounds like an inconsiderate brat. She is a teenager, not too far from being an adult. She can learn to be considerate and a decent human being. Also do not ask for judgement from strangers on the internet if you are going to argue with and become hostile towards everyone who disagrees with you.", "It sounds like you raised a shit son if he was fine with that arrangement. Sounds like gd is growing up to be like her dad.", "but why should op\u2019s granddaughter be the bigger person when her step-mom is literally putting her out of the house of her dad???? when no affair was happening, step-mom literally wanted to divorce her dad? this is not resentment for being husband\u2019s affair baby ( which still could have been understandable) - it\u2019s just pettiness on the side of SIL and DIL deserves everything that\u2019s being thrown at her now\n\nIf op\u2019s granddaughter had been writing this post she would have been lauded for it rather than be condemned. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
