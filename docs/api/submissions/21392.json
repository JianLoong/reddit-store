There is literally a compromise to solve the issue, but the granddaughter just decided she doesn't want to? I don't believe her not wearing headphones is for comfort and is probably just being a jerk since she doesn't like the DIL. Do you want your granddaughter growing up thinking it's OK to be a jerk and not compromise just because she doesn't like someone? \nI think you would be TA if you have someone staying in your home and then not let them get sleep because someone is playing video games. Not getting sleep is torture. Also, the granddaughter has her own room!", "YTA\n\nThis is not about your GD's comfort, you are enabling their poor behaviour.\n\nYour GD is doing this because she does not like your DIL and wants to make her life difficult. If it were about staying up late gaming they would agree to wear headphones or take the console and TV to their room to play, but that would not have the desired effect of annoying your DIL.\n\nYou are doing your GD a massive disservice by teaching her this behaviour is acceptable and she can always have what she wants even if it is hurting others.\n\nOP do YOU like your DIL because it sounds like you also want to punish her.", "YTA\n\nIf I\u2019m getting this correct, you have two rooms- one where your 2 sons are staying and another where your granddaughter is. Your DIL is on the couch in the common area.\n\nYou should have been more insistent with your granddaughter. She has her own space, she can game there. Also, DIL\u2019s request for headphones was very reasonable. \n\nFrom your post it doesn\u2019t seem like DIL has caused any issues, and you\u2019ve already mentioned that your granddaughter hates her. It\u2019s just basic manners to not trouble someone at odd hours. You should teach granddaughter to be better imo. You\u2019re not shaping your granddaughter to be a good human, depending on her age she should either have basic decency by now or be taught some.\n\nETA: after reading some of OP\u2019s comments, she\u2019s even more of an AH. She came to this sub for justification not judgment.", "Yta\n\nDon't have guests in your home if you can't treat them like guests.  \n\nYour gd sounds spoiled and entitled.  You aren't doing her any favors by making her think she should always get what she wants.  \n\nYour gd has all day to play games.  She can stop playing at night and maybe think about others for a change.  It's okay to not like someone, but it's not okay to be rude to people you don't care for.  Is this how you want her to act when she grows up?

Surely she deserves some BASIC comfort.", "YTA.  You\u2019re phrasing this in a deliberately deceptive way to make yourself sound better.  This isn\u2019t your granddaughter\u2019s comfort vs your DIL\u2019s comfort.  This is about allowing your granddaughter to be deliberately rude and obnoxious to your DIL, which is obviously enabling bratty, bad behavior.  Your granddaughter has a whole other home she can go to if your DIL\u2019s presence is so irritating to her.  Don\u2019t let your granddaughter be an asshole.  You know better, you\u2019re just being as petty and nasty as your granddaughter.", "YTA and your granddaughter sounds like she\u2019s headed in that direction as well.

They are family and You make sacrifices for family. Not to mention your elders. But I digress) she forfeited the ability to play games all night. The way I see it there are two reasonable solutions:\n\n1) you impose a gaming curfew; she either can\u2019t play or has to wear headphones after a certain time\n2) she relinquishes her room so she can play as late as she wants \n\nRegardless of her feelings towards her step mother this was a reasonable and respectful request. You have yet to give us details about how your DIL treats your GD. So we can\u2019t make a proper conclusion. You mentioned that it must be obvious there is a problem if she stays with you during her father\u2019s time.

The solution to being called out after asking if you are the AH is to abruptly kick them out. Obviously its a complicated situation with your son being an AH and your DIL choosing to stay with him anyway.\n\nUnfortunately I can see where he got it from and you're teaching your granddaughter the same toxic ways of being. Surely you can manage to reality check and find a way to do better?\n\nYTA", "Hang on - so your solution to this is to kick out your son and DIL when you have made an agreement to help out because your GD, when she stays with you, will not wear headphones?\n\nI rescind my E S H and am opting with YTA.

And why do you enable your granddaughter\u2019s poor treatment of her stepmother?\n\nYour edit makes you look even worse. The answer is kicking out your son and his wife rather than pull your granddaughter into line? Wow you are an AH.", "I understand that you want what\u2019s best for your granddaughter. And it must hurt that she is not accepted info the family by DIL as much as you would like to see.\n\nHowever, by allowing your GD to ignore a very reasonable request, you are setting her up for future failure. Basically it\u2019s acceptable for her to refuse to listen to you AND it\u2019s acceptabel for her to put own wants before someone\u2019s sleep. Putting headphones on so you don\u2019t bother someone would be considered  common decency. \n\nIs this REALLY the person you want her to be?

You may not like your DIL, but allowing your GD to torment her is not going to help anyone. You are just adding on more tension and hostility to an already bad situation. It sounds like your GD is playing at the living room because she wants to irritate your DIL, and you allowing (possibly encouraging) that is unhealthy. She is a child and while she might be right about her grievence, it is part of your job to direct her towards healthier coping mechanisms. I assume you love her and want her to grow up to be a happy adult, so teach her how to make the best of a tough situation. Don't make things worse for her.", "Yta, you dont like your dil so you are allowing your gd to learn not to be considered of people that are staying there. \n\nYour logic is that if they failed to show me respect then I don\u2019t have to be a basic host and considerate. Like example ive had issue with my mil so I shouldn\u2019t have to accommodate her at all? \n\nPlus your \u201csolution\u201d is to kick them instead of having your gd wear headphones is extreme.

She knows she's safe in being the asshole here because neither you nor her dad is going to pull her up. This is a difficult situation that is uncomfortable for both your DIL and GD.

That\u2019s not an affair.", "The child is being failed by the DIL and in part her father for not leaving his wife while she emotionally abuses his daughter.\n\nEveryone is saying that dad did wrong by the DIL, but they also glazed over that they broke up, both dated other people while broke up and then got back together to then find out the break up woman was pregnant, but the DIL is referring to the child as an affair baby even though it happened during the break up, no cheating happened.\n\nThe DIL is the one being emotionally abusive to the child and refuses to let her live with her dad, the grandmother is standing up for her and letting her stand up against the abuse she's getting from the DIL.\n\nI don't get how so many people are missing this, it was really clear.", "My sides are in orbit reading her comments. This is wild as hell on her part", "Honestly though, if I was referred to throughout my life as \"the affair baby\", I wouldnt raise a finger to help them", "I think it must be the factual \u201caffair baby\u201d ?", "Give the OP time, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll make something up.", "Obviously DIL also has some lose screws to stay with these people.", "We don't actually know that first point?", "Lol, yes, I am aware.\n\nBut playing video games on the couch is not sleep deprivation. Pretending like it is is ridiculous.", "I like how OP\u2019s narrative has gone from \u201cgd spends a lot of time at our house and even has a bedroom here\u201d to \u201cgd lives with us\u201d \ud83d\ude44", "Yeah the son/dad needed to put his foot down and tell his wife that his daughter would be staying with them. He shouldn't have allowed this to happen in the first place. Has he even bothered to parent his own daughter with this subject or does he just let his mother(?) and wife dictate everything?", "The grandmother referred to gd as affair baby", "Or she doesn't have any other choice.", "yes we do.\n\nIf he wanted to allow his daughter in his home, he would have his daughter in his home. Laws and courts exist that are set up to create this outcome, if he wanted it.\n\nOP is upset with DIL because the affair baby couldn't stay in OP's son's house. Which is OP's SON's fault. If he wanted the child to stay at his house, his child would have stayed at his house, even if it meant divorcing his wife if she objected.\n\nThis is ALLLLLL on him.", "If you do it every night where someone is trying to sleep yes it is.", "It is if night after night you're denting someone sleep for hours on end. Doesn't sound like this kid has a bed time.\n\nETA not to mention all the emotional abuse dil probably has to deal with on the daily living with them.", "If your husband let another woman pregnant and then wanted that affair baby to live with you would you accepted that?\nI don\u2019t think anyone would be happy with that situation.\nInstead of being mad to your son for being a cheater you hate your DIL\u2026\nYTA!!!", "That\u2019s your sons fault, not hers. He chose his wife over his affair baby. I feel sorry for your granddaughter because it doesn\u2019t sound like any of the adults in her life are doing a good job at raising her to be a decent human being.\n\nYTA", "Maybe we\u2019d be able to understand you better if you spoke more directly, and actually answered questions. Why has DIL done to GD?", "Oh yes I can't imagine why your DIL would be upset about living with the literal bastard child of his affair partner. Your son's honestly the biggest AH but I can definitely see where he gets it from.", "Given that they were already separated at one point in time, I doubt that.", "The DIL doesn't want her in the home. She said that in a comment. The DIL refuses allowing the daughter to live with her dad.\n\nThe DIL also refers to her as the \"affair baby\" but everyone is missing that they were broke up and dating other people while broke up. The son never cheated.", "No it isn\u2019t. \n\nThe DIL can wear noise canceling sleeping muffs if it\u2019s that bad. Lol. Stop acting like it\u2019s torture. It\u2019s not.", ">Also do not ask for judgement from strangers on the internet if you are going to argue with and become hostile towards everyone who disagrees with you.\n\nThis is always what gets me. A lot of people just come here to be reinforced in their choice and then are surprised when nobody agrees and don't want to change what they were doing coming up with a bunch of excuses.", "So, this grown woman kicks a child out of the house.\n\nGrandma steps up to raise them.\n\nThen the grown woman has financial issues. \n\nGrandma steps up to help\u2026again.\n\nBut grandma is the asshole? Lol", "She raised a son who not only has affairs, but doesn't take care of the children he created in the affair. What makes you think she raised the granddaughter to be any better of a person?"]}
