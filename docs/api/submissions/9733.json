After she had our 4 year old she had at least gained another 50 lbs. That\u2019s when she put herself on a diet and I was very supportive, I helped make healthier meals and kept healthier snacks in the house and went on walks with her. She had dropped about 20 lbs, she was very proud of herself. She was doing really good then found out she was pregnant with our 2 year old.\n\nAfter she had second child she started going to the gym every weekend, and running. Which eventually turned into every other morning. Comes to present time, she goes every single day, she wakes up at 6am and goes to the gym till I have to leave for work at 9. She drops the kids off at pre school and goes to work. She gets off a few hours before me, and picks the kids up. Then when I get home from work at 730, she immediately leaves to go back to the gym for another 3 hours. \n\nI\u2019m very proud of her for her motivation, and she is down to 140, (She was 250 after our 1st child) but I work long hours 6 days a week. On my day off, if she is also off, she takes advantage of that and leaves the kids with me and goes. She doesn\u2019t make dinner anymore, I make it, which I don\u2019t mind I just come home exhausted. By the time she gets back I\u2019ve already gave the kids dinner and bathed them and put them to sleep. I\u2019ve mentioned to her skipping a day before and she acts like I\u2019m asking her to commit a robbery. \n\nOur kids both had the stomach bug this week and my 4 year old just kept crying for mommy, so I spammed Christie\u2019s phone till she answered. She came home and comforted him to he fell asleep, then came out my room and gave me hell for not being able to \u201chandle the situation myself.\u201d I got angry and told her she needed to stop going to the gym so much and actually stay home and be a mom to her sons. She got angry and said I was overreacting and that I\u2019m not supportive of her weight loss journey. I told her I was, but that doesn\u2019t mean she can be gone all the time.

She needs therapy, and probably weight lifting. I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s doing tons of cardio? Either way too much of anything is a bad thing, even working out. She may be terrified of gaining weight again so the way you approach this is important. Start off by telling her you care about her and her health. That you are not asking her to give up working out at all but that her being at the gym for X amount of hours is starting to affect her family/you are exhausted trying to do this on your own. There may be more to her drive to get away from the house. Hoping for the best for you guys!", "NTA.

She should keep the morning workouts and drop the rest.", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019ve been more than reasonable and helpful in her journey and the moment you need to ask her for help she acts like this.

As of right now, I would say NTA, she is only home with the kids for about 3 hrs, isn't home for dinner, and doesn't even help with bedtime routines. Going to the gym twice every single day doesn't seem healthy either, but I am no expert in that area. Also, she couldn't skip the gym for one day when the kids were sick and crying for her? That makes her TA in my opinion.", "NTA\n\nAt this rate, the weight she'll lose most successfully will be equal to two children and a husband.", "NTA- Did you ever wonder if she\u2019s really at the gym though?", "NTA, she could do some rest day every here and there (actually recommended).\n\nBut I find it weird you call your kids HER kids.", "Are you sure she is at the gym the whole time she is gone?

My son was an alcoholic for many years.  We\u2019re talking passing out and being taken to the hospital type of shit.  Several years ago, he managed to quit drinking and stayed sober for about two years.  He was running and working out like crazy.  Excessively so.  I tried talking to him about how he was overdoing it and substituting the exercise high for drinking.  He wouldn\u2019t listen.\n\nHe ended up injuring himself and couldn\u2019t work out like he had been doing.  And, he went back to alcohol and was worse than ever.  It was really really bad.  I was haunted by the thoughts of receiving a call from someone telling me he had died. Not unlike the cop who called me when my brother had overdosed.\n\nThe good news in my sons case was that, after falling hard, he got into detox and and recovery and is now doing very well.  Leaving out lots of details here, but I think that this time it will stick.  Because he isn\u2019t subbing drinking for a new obsession.  He is highly motivated by knowing how close he came to death\u2019s door and by helping others achieve lasting sobriety.  I\u2019m so proud of him.  \n\nAnyway, sorry for the long tale of woe here.  I do have a point for your situation.  Food and overeating is in my humble opinion not too much different from drugs or alcohol addiction.  It is something that helps to stuff down deeper issues.  A comfort.  And, losing weight and exercising is great and generates a lot of positive feedback and give its own sort of high.  In a way, maybe it replaces the satisfaction that one gains from the first addiction (food or alcohol) for the second one (losing weight, endorphins gained from exercise).  Either way, it seems an obsessive behavior that doesn\u2019t get to the root of the problem.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that you are going through this and have so much empathy for you and your situation.  If at all possible, I think that counseling for her and for both of you as a couple would be very helpful.  Al Anon may be helpful.

I'm not immediately jumping to the conclusion that she's cheating on you with someone, but her absence and avoidance has now become the 3rd 'person' in your marriage.\n\nSit her down (or write her a text if you don't think she will listen or react poorly) and tell her that you can't continue this way, and you are worried about her. \n\nAsk her to keep it to a max of once every 24 hours, (no morning AND night in the same day, and no evening and then the very next morning) and a max of 2.5 hours each time (or whatever time is less than now but reasonable).  The fact is she has 2 kids and a husband to consider so it's not wrong for her to have some boundaries and limits to the time she can expect to devote to her hobby.  Or whatever this is. \n\nBut make sure that she agrees to those limits - you don't get to tell her how to spend her time because she needs to choose to be home more after hearing from you.

Suggest having dinner together the next night when the kids are asleep and tell her that you're looking forward to talking.\n\nIf she doesn't, push her to go to a therapist and talk out whatever is going on.  Remind her - without any threat - that this is not sustainable for you and that you won't continue on this basis and that you need to figure out how to make things better for your kids and for yourself, OP.  If she calls that selfish, then remind her that you also need to care for yourself right now so that you can be the best dad possible and since you don't think she is thinking of you.  It's the honest truth.\n\nDo you have a spare room to sleep in?  Would this give her more space from you somehow where she wouldn't feel the need to run to the gym so much?  I wouldn't offer to sleep there, but it might be a good option for her and it might make her feel some degree of control over something (space) that is hers.  \n\nFrom there - I think you have some decisions to make.

Some days she works till 6 if I am off that day.", "But she\u2019s definitely working up a sweat.", "I think 5\u2019 5\u201d is the US average.", "As an exercise professional I can tell you that you don't even need to go near a gym to gain muscle, so I don't know what you're getting so pernickity about.\n\nConsidering the amount of weight she's dropped from, it's highly likely she barely exercised at all before, and she doesn't really need to do the right exercise or eat the right way, ANY kind of exercise would have had her gaining muscle at the start.\n\nYou're coming from a place of starving yourself though, so you wouldn't get that. You don't need to be gulping protein shakes and eating chicken for breakfast to gain muscle.", " . . . What? This is absolutely not true.", "This assumes completely accurate assessments by OP. An assumption I am not fond of making.  This also doesn't appear to include commuting or any other activities such as breaking for food.  I will admit that even then it seems a bit excessive.  At my peak I was spending about 4 hours a day with commute to the gym and food/rest breaks.", "Diet is part of it which is why I don't understand why you edited out the first part of my sentence. Cherry-picking? Caloric expenditure via metabolism is absolutely a big part too. Calorie intake vs calories used is real science. Also, metabolic maintenance is a real thing too. If you would like links I can provide them but really this pretty basic stuff google can do for you. Please stop cherry picking and then giving verifiably false statements.", "And?", "Info: does she get the kids dressed in the morning and does she give them breakfast?", "So not the same hours.", "I think 5'9\" is average for a man and 5'4\" is average for a woman.", "Settle down, my point is diet has MUCH more to do with maintenance of weight than exercise does.  For example, you would have to run on a treadmill for over two hours to get rid of the calories from a Big Mac and fries with a sugary soda.  That is not sustainable or realistic. You have to focus on diet in order to maintain a proper weight.  Exercise is a great supplement to a proper diet but someone thinking that focusing on exercise is going to be enough is fooling themselves.  That kind of mentality is what leads people to working out then rewarding themselves by eating poorly.  Literally taking two steps forward and two to three steps back.  I have worked out and dieted literally my entire life so I kinda know a thing or two and I certainly understand the concept of CICO.   Just simply stating that the overall main focus has to be diet with exercise being something that is done secondarily to diet.", ">Cherry-picking?\n\nWelcome to Reddit. This place is chock full of the \"aKsChUaLlllllllY\" and \"tecKnically\" types.", "She gets them dressed, but the school provides breakfast", "I see now, and you are not wrong.  Your emphasis on MUCH is debatable as you already understand CICO but I won't argue your point.  I will mention that metabolic control is a function of exercise and that only proper diet is not going to keep the weight off in long term if you were once overweight.  Your diet could be the healthiest and most nutritionally balanced diet on earth but if you become bed ridden for any reason expect that you will gain weight.  Of course, this only really applies to people that were once overweight in the first place.  You can't become a slug after losing weight and expect diet to carry you.", "That isn't really cherry-picking tho.  Cherry-picking is pulling a very specific part out of an opponents argument and attacking just that while ignoring the rest.  Even when the rest includes some of the subject they using as a counter argument.  Their response after my statement clarifies but it still stands that they intentionally did not include the part about diet that I had in my statement.", "So she does morning duty, pickup drop off after school care/ snacks and then you get dinner and bathing and bed time\u2026 sounds pretty evenly split!\n\nWith approximately 3 hours each of kiddo time in addition to working.\n\nMaybe it isn\u2019t about the time necessarily working out - but having time spent equally so she can do her time? \n\nWhen she is home in the evening - do you have time to yourself or do you do all the child caring together?", "She gets up at 6am - let\u2019s say she makes it to the gym by 6:30 works out for an hour, get dressed and back home before he leaves at 9. She then takes kids over to daycare and goes to work - so clearly there is some sort of breakfast routine she has for the kids that she does as he says he\u2019s on dinner duty\u2026\n\nIt feels like they truly split the caretaking - and he wants her present for the evening one. I think info is needed for her morning routine with the kiddos. If she is the one to get them dressed, fed and out the door and he does the night routine - then it\u2019s fair. My guess is the way she structured it - it\u2019s truly shared parenting- she deserves a medal!!!\n\nPS - I think if he did the breakfast and got the kiddos ready in the AM he would\u2019ve have mentioned it. She is choosing not to eat late and having him do the night routine.", "And?", "It\u2019s shared! If she is doing the morning routine and he is doing the evening routine and they are splitting the weekend- who cares if she is working out during her free time\u2026"]}
