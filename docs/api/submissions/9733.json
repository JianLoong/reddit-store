We\u2019ve been married 5 years and have 2 kids together ages 4 and 2.\n\nMy wife has always been a plus size girl, but I found it beautiful. I never once thought she looked bad. After she had our 4 year old she had at least gained another 50 lbs. That\u2019s when she put herself on a diet and I was very supportive, I helped make healthier meals and kept healthier snacks in the house and went on walks with her. She had dropped about 20 lbs, she was very proud of herself. She was doing really good then found out she was pregnant with our 2 year old.\n\nAfter she had second child she started going to the gym every weekend, and running. Which eventually turned into every other morning. Comes to present time, she goes every single day, she wakes up at 6am and goes to the gym till I have to leave for work at 9. She drops the kids off at pre school and goes to work. She gets off a few hours before me, and picks the kids up. Then when I get home from work at 730, she immediately leaves to go back to the gym for another 3 hours. \n\nI\u2019m very proud of her for her motivation, and she is down to 140, (She was 250 after our 1st child) but I work long hours 6 days a week. On my day off, if she is also off, she takes advantage of that and leaves the kids with me and goes. She doesn\u2019t make dinner anymore, I make it, which I don\u2019t mind I just come home exhausted. By the time she gets back I\u2019ve already gave the kids dinner and bathed them and put them to sleep. I\u2019ve mentioned to her skipping a day before and she acts like I\u2019m asking her to commit a robbery. \n\nOur kids both had the stomach bug this week and my 4 year old just kept crying for mommy, so I spammed Christie\u2019s phone till she answered. She came home and comforted him to he fell asleep, then came out my room and gave me hell for not being able to \u201chandle the situation myself.\u201d I got angry and told her she needed to stop going to the gym so much and actually stay home and be a mom to her sons. She got angry and said I was overreacting and that I\u2019m not supportive of her weight loss journey. I told her I was, but that doesn\u2019t mean she can be gone all the time. She has since been snappy with me, but has cut back to only going in the morning these past few days.", "created_utc": 1676167533, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1104doa/aita_for_telling_my_wife_to_stop_going_to_the_gym/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Encourage her to talk to her doctor about this and)or a therapist. If she won't go alone go with her for couple's counseling. In the meantime, try to be empathic about it until you determine if there is something else going on - this is not normal behavior.", "NTA. If she's really gong to the gym 6 hours a day, she might have anorexia athletica -- she needs your help, jut not in the way you are giving it by watching the kids while she goes to the gym for 42 hours a week.", "NTA. 6 hours a day, and I am presuming 7 days a week seems excessive. I wonder if there's something more going on with your wife and her self-esteem/how she views her body.", "NTA, that\u2019s an excessive amount of time to be spending at the gym, especially when it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re getting an equal amount of time for yourself. I could be wrong but it seems to me like she has unhealthy obsession with exercise due to fear of becoming overweight again.", "NTA, but your wife sounds like she is going through something, whether it\u2019s body dysmorphia or something else. Not even the most gym rattiest of gym rats spends that much time at the gym, that\u2019s actually alarming.", "NTA-SIX hours a day every day is entirely too much exercising\u2026. Child rearing is a joint job\u2026. She can go in the morning OR the evening that\u2019s perfectly fine. I see nothing wrong with you telling her your feelings. Kids crying for their mommy means it\u2019s affecting them too\u2026. \n\nHopefully she can either agree to her 3 hrs a day or seek professional help. \n\nI get it she\u2019s focused on her goals, but she\u2019s also missing out on her babies", "NTA. This is wildly excessive and your kids do in fact need their mother.\n\nAny dude who did this would be raked over the coals.", "NTA...but that level of gym usage might actually be a symptom of addiction or another mental health issue.  When things settle down, you might want to check in with her and see how she's really doing.", "NTA\n\nAlthough I think this is amazing that your wife is going on a weight-loss journey and trying to make her health better, 6 hours at the gym every day is a little extreme. Experts usually recommend working out 3 days a week for the average person.", "NTA. Any activity that cuts into your ability to be a borderline decent spouse and/or parent is not healthy. Regardless if it helps you lose weight and stay in shape.", "NTA she goes to the gym 40 hours a week? I\u2019m a little suspicious that she met a guy named Jim, not going to an actual gym.", "NTA", "NTA. As a regular gym-goer, I can tell you that going six hours a day, every day of the week is over-exercising and actually counter-productive. The fact that is has increased to this level concerns me. Is the gym her only form of escape, or has she developed orthorexia? This is not normal behaviour, it sounds more like she\u2019s fulfilling a compulsion.", "NTA I started reading your post ready to tell you off but sadly it seems your wife has an addiction. She needs therapy, and probably weight lifting. I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s doing tons of cardio? Either way too much of anything is a bad thing, even working out. She may be terrified of gaining weight again so the way you approach this is important. Start off by telling her you care about her and her health. That you are not asking her to give up working out at all but that her being at the gym for X amount of hours is starting to affect her family/you are exhausted trying to do this on your own. There may be more to her drive to get away from the house. Hoping for the best for you guys!", "NTA. While it's good that she's striving for a healthier lifestyle it's not an excuse to abandon her responsibilities to her family. Being gone 6 hours a day to work out is overkill. Perhaps it's time to think about a home gym", "NTA 3 hours been 730-1030 is unreasonable when you have a family with young children. Twice a day is unreasonable unless you're training for something specific. She's either lying or addicted.", "Your wife is going to the gym for 6 hours a day?  6?  Hours?\n\nCould she have an addiction to working out?  I understand that it can happen and is often connected to eating disorders and body image dysmorphia.\n\nYou are definitely NTA but I think really ,NAH.  Something is not ok with your wife.  She's literally sacrificing her family for the gym.", "NTA. Her journey is done shes is being excessive and not contributing her weight here", "INFO: So, how long has she been having an affair under the guise of \"going to the gym\"?", "Yeah, I can't imagine not seeing my kid on purpose. I was working 12 hour days for a while and would only see her a few minutes before work and if I went in to check on her while she slept. My husband was doing ALL the parenting,  so I felt like a shit mom and a shit wife... even with him reminding me that I was working FOR us, and earning the money to help us, I felt SO guilty. And I'm sure he felt like a single parent.  \ud83d\ude2a\n\nShe's not acting like a mom or wife if she's never with her family. I'm sorry it's all fallen to you, hopefully she'll realize she should spend some time with the kids before that time is gone. They grow too fast. I miss having a toddler. \ud83d\ude05", "NTA: I hope she considers what you told her. Going once a day I think is really good. But going twice a day for several hours while leaving you to do everything is way too much. You have a family together and it shouldn't all be on you. I'm not a mental health professional but I wonder if she has an addiction to working out. You can be addicted to anything so it's possible. This is above the normal amount of working out especially when you are neglecting your responsibilities. You may want to consider looking this up and discussing it with your wife. If she is addicted to working out, she may not realize it.", "NTA\n\nPeople do get addicted to the dopamine that exercise gives you but she's not doing herself any favours in her family life. \n\nIt actually doesn't sound like she is spending any time with her family.  She's either at the gym or working.\n\nI would wonder what else is going on and who she has met.  You might need to do some investigation.  It may be nothing or she has someone on the side.", "NTA. Olol. Good job with this post.", "nta. Sounds like she's become addicted to exercise.  Everything in moderation. She should keep the morning workouts and drop the rest.", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019ve been more than reasonable and helpful in her journey and the moment you need to ask her for help she acts like this. Also 6 hours a day is way way to much for the gym even body builders and high level athletes don\u2019t spend 6 hours a day in the gym she may be up to other activities.", "NTA, and I think she\u2019s just addicted to it at this point. The weight loss, the changing body, the muscle definition, the increased strength, the realizing how far she\u2019s come from those pregnancy and post-partum days, etc.  We can\u2019t deny that stuff feels great. But this is excessive. \n  \n  \n  \nI used to run 5 miles a day 5-6 mornings a week and would get antsy on my off days. Like, the itch to get out there on the pavement is real. But having kids at home that needed and wanted me, I went before they woke up.", "Nta you are essentially a single parent", "NTA\n\nCould she have a disorder ? \n\nNot to be an alarmist but 6 hours a day every day is - intense to say the least  she could have a problem.\n\nIf not then the problem remains she needs to share responsibility for the kids in this together", "NTA, its understandable that you feel this way. with her at the gym so many hours of the day a lot of the workload is being pushed onto you. from what i read youve been very supportive, but 6 hours at the gym is a bit excessive\u2026.", "Info, why doesn't she go to the gym while the kids are at preschool? As of right now, I would say NTA, she is only home with the kids for about 3 hrs, isn't home for dinner, and doesn't even help with bedtime routines. Going to the gym twice every single day doesn't seem healthy either, but I am no expert in that area. Also, she couldn't skip the gym for one day when the kids were sick and crying for her? That makes her TA in my opinion.", "NTA\n\nAt this rate, the weight she'll lose most successfully will be equal to two children and a husband.", "NTA- Did you ever wonder if she\u2019s really at the gym though?", "NTA, she could do some rest day every here and there (actually recommended).\n\nBut I find it weird you call your kids HER kids.", "Are you sure she is at the gym the whole time she is gone?
