He allowed the boys to initially go upstairs and only play on his PS5. We have rules for all of the house and that's just respect our stuff and return it how you found it. \nThe boys decided after an hour of playing ps5 they wanted to play ping pong. My husband is not confrontational but asked they be careful don't mess up anything. Then the boys removed the ping pong table and began playing pool. We hear them screaming and having fun and one of them we will call \"A\" yells \"I hit that ball so hard that it popped over another\". 30 minutes later I hear the air hockey table on and the boys are playing \"A\" being very rambunctious to the point several members had to tell him to calm down. I was cooking at the time but briefly went upstairs and told both they could have fun but chill out and not play aggressively. Both boys agree and continue to play air hockey.

Mallets have felt on the bottom to avoid scratching, \"A\"  used the plastic knob to play. The entire side of the air hockey table has about 40 deep scratches. I showed \"A\" the pool table and he apologized for roughhousing. \nI told him he could repay me via help with yard work and gardening bi-weekly until the end of the year. My lawn is maintained so it's really just time for us to talk, garden and make sure all is well in his world. I didn't expect money from him or his parents just ownership of responsibility. \n\nWell, his mom has changed her tune and said while her son \"A\" admits to the damage am I sure it wasn't really \"B\".

They can then handle it the way they seem fit, for instance by insurance", "NTA.  \n\nYou're doing exactly the right thing here.  They're your relatives so you're dealing with them and not leaving it to your husband to do it.  You're getting a fair outcome for your husband.\n\nI agree with you completely.  If A's mother has a problem with A doing yard work, then she needs to pay for the damage.  Her reaction is strange.  Most parents would be very grateful NOT to have to pay up and to have the option of having the kid \"pay\" through yard work.\n\nI wouldn't have rough-housed to the point of damaging someone else's property as a kid and A's mother's attitude shows why A does it.  The gardening--and the fact that it would go on for a while--is a great way to teach A that actions have consequences, and yet A's mother is doing her best to avoid teaching A consequences.  She is not doing right by A.", "His mother his an enabler.  Send her a bill.", "NTA. I have ADD and know to treat others property with respect. A was way out of line. Your offer for the gardening is actually pretty light IMO, and I like that your motives are to get closer to A. Maybe talk with A's mother about your reasons for the gardening and she might relent. In any case it's good that A's mother isn't going toe-to-toe with you and just accepting the damage her kid did.", "Sounds like they enjoy coming over using your games room. That just came to an abrupt end. If they refuse to take responsibility and accept some very minor punishment then they\u2019ve burned a bridge.", "NTA \u201cif his diagnoses means that he can\u2019t help himself, then you\u2019re an unfit mother in this situation for not supervising him. So are you an unfit mother or is he capable of being responsible and accountable?\u201d", "NTA. She doesn't realise it, but his mother is ruining her son's future by pushing for him to get away with everything.", "Nta. He admitted to damaging it. And having ADD doesn't excuse damaging something and not having responsibility", "No wonder A acts like a 10 year old, his mom has prevented him from ever growing up. The way you were describing them acting, I can't believe a 16 year old kid would act this stupid for now apparent reason.", "NTA. I love the \"punishment\" you gave him for the damage. Connecting with him will benefit him more than anything.  Plus knowing how to garden is a great life skill", "NTA. My son once took a stick and \"decorated\" my mom's new car. He was about 4. Our homeowners insurance covered it. No one got mad, no one tried to shirk responsibility and I never once considered using his autism as an excuse to get out of paying.

The best gift you can give A is the lesson in being honest and responsible.", "NTA - you handled the aftermath correctly.  \n\nA bit more supervision would clearly have been helpful. Teenagers are destructive idiots, and definitely were not processing the damage they were doing until it was too late.  This doesn\u2019t let them off the hook for it, but an ounce of prevention\u2026.", "NTA if she is using his diagnosis as an excuse then she should have been upstairs supervising.

The 16 year old(s) don't owe you money, their parents do and apparently the parents want to play dumb.", "Info \u2014 is it bi-weekly or monthly?", "NTA, gets the kid to chat, but the mom is probably loaded and she can stop his pocket money to pay for it all", "NAH\n\nBut there's a bit of foolishness in here. It's pretty common for teen boys to be inclined towards rough-housing and general foolishness, and you have a prime location for teen boys to engage in that kind of foolishness, and you let two teen boys, who are family, but you don't seem to know terribly well, have sole possession of this \"man cave\". That they didn't know when to stop and trashed something isn't all that surprising.\n\nHaving ADD is not a reason for him not to know better. He may have problems with self-regulation that mean that he finds it hard to calm himself down and not go over the top, but that's not the same thing at all. He's 16 years old, and well on his way to adulthood. He needs to be learning to control and manage his behavior, and his parents need to be supporting him.\n\nGardening for the remainder of the year seems like a reasonable consequence. He didn't cause this damage maliciously, or probably even intentionally, but he still did it, and repaying you with gardening offers him a sensible way of paying off his debt himself, and supports teaching him to take responsibility for his actions and choices.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
