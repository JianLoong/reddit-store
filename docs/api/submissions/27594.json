My husband is not confrontational but asked they be careful don't mess up anything. Then the boys removed the ping pong table and began playing pool. We hear them screaming and having fun and one of them we will call \"A\" yells \"I hit that ball so hard that it popped over another\". 30 minutes later I hear the air hockey table on and the boys are playing \"A\" being very rambunctious to the point several members had to tell him to calm down.

They can then handle it the way they seem fit, for instance by insurance", "NTA.  \n\nYou're doing exactly the right thing here.  They're your relatives so you're dealing with them and not leaving it to your husband to do it.  You're getting a fair outcome for your husband.\n\nI agree with you completely.  If A's mother has a problem with A doing yard work, then she needs to pay for the damage.  Her reaction is strange.  Most parents would be very grateful NOT to have to pay up and to have the option of having the kid \"pay\" through yard work.\n\nI wouldn't have rough-housed to the point of damaging someone else's property as a kid and A's mother's attitude shows why A does it.  The gardening--and the fact that it would go on for a while--is a great way to teach A that actions have consequences, and yet A's mother is doing her best to avoid teaching A consequences.  She is not doing right by A.", "His mother his an enabler.  Send her a bill.", "NTA. I have ADD and know to treat others property with respect. A was way out of line. Your offer for the gardening is actually pretty light IMO, and I like that your motives are to get closer to A. Maybe talk with A's mother about your reasons for the gardening and she might relent. In any case it's good that A's mother isn't going toe-to-toe with you and just accepting the damage her kid did.", "Sounds like they enjoy coming over using your games room. That just came to an abrupt end. If they refuse to take responsibility and accept some very minor punishment then they\u2019ve burned a bridge.", "NTA \u201cif his diagnoses means that he can\u2019t help himself, then you\u2019re an unfit mother in this situation for not supervising him. So are you an unfit mother or is he capable of being responsible and accountable?\u201d", "NTA. She doesn't realise it, but his mother is ruining her son's future by pushing for him to get away with everything.", "Nta. He admitted to damaging it. And having ADD doesn't excuse damaging something and not having responsibility", "No wonder A acts like a 10 year old, his mom has prevented him from ever growing up. The way you were describing them acting, I can't believe a 16 year old kid would act this stupid for now apparent reason.", "NTA. I love the \"punishment\" you gave him for the damage. Connecting with him will benefit him more than anything.  Plus knowing how to garden is a great life skill", "NTA. My son once took a stick and \"decorated\" my mom's new car. He was about 4. Our homeowners insurance covered it. No one got mad, no one tried to shirk responsibility and I never once considered using his autism as an excuse to get out of paying.

The best gift you can give A is the lesson in being honest and responsible.", "NTA - you handled the aftermath correctly.  \n\nA bit more supervision would clearly have been helpful. Teenagers are destructive idiots, and definitely were not processing the damage they were doing until it was too late.  This doesn\u2019t let them off the hook for it, but an ounce of prevention\u2026.", "NTA if she is using his diagnosis as an excuse then she should have been upstairs supervising.

Just keep them out of the basement moving forward.", "NTA but I would just consider it a \"gift\" and not let them play with your expensive stuff unsupervised again. The 16 year old(s) don't owe you money, their parents do and apparently the parents want to play dumb.", "Info \u2014 is it bi-weekly or monthly?", "NTA, gets the kid to chat, but the mom is probably loaded and she can stop his pocket money to pay for it all", "NAH\n\nBut there's a bit of foolishness in here. It's pretty common for teen boys to be inclined towards rough-housing and general foolishness, and you have a prime location for teen boys to engage in that kind of foolishness, and you let two teen boys, who are family, but you don't seem to know terribly well, have sole possession of this \"man cave\". That they didn't know when to stop and trashed something isn't all that surprising.\n\nHaving ADD is not a reason for him not to know better. He may have problems with self-regulation that mean that he finds it hard to calm himself down and not go over the top, but that's not the same thing at all. He's 16 years old, and well on his way to adulthood. He needs to be learning to control and manage his behavior, and his parents need to be supporting him.\n\nGardening for the remainder of the year seems like a reasonable consequence. He didn't cause this damage maliciously, or probably even intentionally, but he still did it, and repaying you with gardening offers him a sensible way of paying off his debt himself, and supports teaching him to take responsibility for his actions and choices.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Some reflective gardening sounds ideal.", "Exactly.  When my daughter was a freshman in college  one of her 3 roommates had ADD this girl never washed a dish, decided to dye her hair and left purple hair dye all over the shower and because it wasn't washed immediately it stained the shower. She would leave food out until it rotted and just overall was messy, rude and damaging to the suite.  Daughter and other 2 roommates decided to go to housing because they were sick of rotting food which was causing bugs and didn't want to be charged for damages at end of year.  Housing ended up removing the roommate.  Roommates mother went on a major rant about how these girls should have been more understanding because her daughter  had ADD and they should have picked up the slack and cleaned up for her and helped repair items or split the cost to repair because it wasn't her daughter's fault.   I often wonder now that these kids are all in their mid-20's how life is working out for that girl.  Her mother did her no favors making excuses and expecting others to cover for her daughter.", "[removed]", "In the US a normal homeowner's insurance deductible is $1000-$2,500.", "The best part is ADD isn't a diagnosis anymore its just ADHD now.", "The 16 year olds have different parents but she absolutely was trying to throw cousin \"B\" under the bus.

But I was only diagnosed at university and my parents did not consider it an excuse at any point.\n\nI can tell you the transition from home (where there is structure, reminders, people to remind you) to university was awful. People with ADHD don\u2019t build habits well so a change of environment - at the same time as losing your support systems can be crippling. I was lucky in that I was catered and had my own bedroom (limited shared spaces) but I felt like such an idiot and also I know my issues would have impacted my friends at times (missing stuff, super messy etc). It was no one\u2019s issue but my own to resolve - but my god would it have been helpful to 1) know it was a medical issue and 2) have some support for that transition.\n\nOn the bright side - I\u2019m doing great now. Well paying and interesting job, great husband and dog, nice (and very clean) house. Since I got the tools I needed I\u2019ve become the other end of the scale in terms of maintaining a clean, tidy, clutter free house (with you know.. a few secret chaos cupboards).\n\nI was very lucky that I got through the rough patch without serious consequences. I do not blame you at all for having her removed and protecting your daughter.
