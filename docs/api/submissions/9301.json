He left behind 3 children, Max (34M), Lin (32F), and Amy (30F). Lin and Amy are very career driven and are successful. Max is not. He is a persistent mooch and extremely lazy.\n\nCurrently, Max is living in a house given by his mother. He owes over 10k in taxes, has 2 broke down vehicles, and has on and off jobs. He smokes weed constantly and can barely afford food for him, his wife, and their dog. His water and power have been shut off due to him not paying for said utilities. His wife works a part time job because she doesn\u2019t have any experience and recently received her green card and work papers. (They got married on the K-1 visa).\n\nMy uncle left each child $25,000 in separate accounts. Lin and Amy haven\u2019t touched theirs because they haven\u2019t needed to use it. Max has blown through it completely, but he hasn\u2019t touched the debt he\u2019s deeply in. Max gets jobs, but he works long enough to get fired and earn unemployment benefits. He has talked about this and always says \u201coh just didn\u2019t work out.\u201d My uncle got him a job with a friend, but the friend told my uncle that \u201cMax sits around when he\u2019s on the job or doesn\u2019t even show up.\u201d Hence he\u2019s fired.\n\nMy uncle lived in the house I currently reside in (owned by my mother and father), and Max would stay here for weeks on end with his wife and dog. My uncle was debilitated and they let him live in filth. Fleas were everywhere, roaches and silverfish too. This is a 1000 sq ft space. It was foul and completely abhorrent how they allowed him to live in this state.\n\nWhen my uncle left to live in Lin\u2019s home, Max was still up here for about a week. When my mother and I came to check it out, the entire place looked as if someone had a food fight as well as a frat party. Fleas and the other bugs still very evident.\n\nIt took 2 months to clean. Now, just last night, Max texted me asking for a place to stay until he can \u2018get on his feet\u2019. The IRS is repossessing the house and his vehicles. I told him last night, \u201cI cannot take you in due to how much of a mess you left. I hope you find a place soon.\u201d He called me an AH and has been trashing me to the family. My parents agree that Max, his wife, and dog shouldn\u2019t be living with me either.
