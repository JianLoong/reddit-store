My 7 year old has recently been having epic tantrums that he seems to save especially for me.

On to the issue.\n\nHusband texts to ask if we want to go out for dinner, I say sure and stop making pasta and decide to take kids to the park for a bit instead. Cue meltdown by 7 year old. By the time I realize he might need a snack and am offering him a granola bar he\u2019s shouting so loud my ears are ringing and I send him to his room where he continues to scream. Wanting husband to understand the level of unhinged I send him a voice memo, hoping he can give me some insight when he gets home or at least get an idea of what\u2019s going on. I go back to making pasta since I don\u2019t know if were going out anymore. \n\nWhen husband gets home he says he says he doesn\u2019t know if we\u2019re going out and I say I don\u2019t know either. He says \u201cwell I don\u2019t want to go\u201d and I say \u201cok\u201d and turn away. Husband gets all furious, says \u201cforget it\u201d and stomps off. Then comes back to ask why I would send those messages but starts cutting me off every time I try to explain. He seems to think I wanted him to solve it all from his car. So I shout back he needs to wait for an answer if he asks a question and he yells back \u201cyou guys figure out dinner I have stuff to do\u201d and goes outside to his shop.\n\nI\u2019m pretty pissed and now crying so I made pasta for the kids (but just the kids - I usually make the pasta, he cooks the pasta and sauce then I do cleanup - I don\u2019t care if not including him for dinner makes me the AH, strictly asking about the voice memo bit).\n\nETA since the same comment is being made a lot. I was texting him before he left the office. Told him kid was losing his mind and I was at my wits end. I only knew he was driving because he texted back \u201cI\u2019m driving\u201d after I sent the voice memos.

When you know better, you do better. It sounds like OP and spouse are overwhelmed and out of tools to manage the situation. OP, I highly recommend reading The Explosive Child by Ross W. Greene. It's very helpful. I would definitely recommend as much counseling as you are able to utilize. Perhaps try family counseling: some partners who won't agree to couples counseling will do family therapy. Good luck", ">Then a text saying I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. Then the voice memo.\n\nOkay...\n\nI can only see two possible reasons for your behaviour. It sounds like you either\n\n* (1) wanted him to magically solve the problem remotely, or\n\n* (2) were feeling stressed and miserable and decided to shove those negative emotions into him so he can be stressed and miserable too.\n\nThe first motivation is unrealistic - there is nothing he can do remotely that will stop a child that's mid meltdown. This seems to be what your husband believes you wanted and he's understandably frustrated by the impossible demand.\n\nThe second motivation is just awful. You're miserable so you want to upset someone else in order to make yourself feel better? You find it satisfying to know that he'll now be just as stressed in that moment as you are? That's selfish - and unproductive.  \n\n**Your desire to share your misery actually undermines his ability to help you.** \n\nNow, instead of him coming home and being able to step in (like a wrestling match where you tag the fresh partner in to relieve the exhausted teammate), he's coming home already stressed and upset which means he isn't able to effectively diffuse the situation by being calm.\n\nIt doesn't even matter that he turned out to be driving at the time. Even if he was still at work, it's incredibly inconsiderate to send him a voice note of a screaming meltdown. It doesn't benefit him in any way to receive that, and it doesn't benefit you because it won't solve the problem. Take this action out of your parenting repertoire entirely.\n\nIn the future, try articulating what you actually need in that moment (eg: X is melting down, I need an ETA on when you'll get here). If it isn't about needing something in that moment and instead wanting to discuss how to handle a situation, have that conversation when he gets home - and actually talk, meaning describing the context before the meltdown and what you attempted to do to help; don't just play a recording of your kid shrieking because that won't convey anything more than \"X melted down\" would convey without creating extra stress.\n\nESH because he was also inconsiderate and rude to you once he got home. But you definitely started that ball in motion and set the miserable tone for the evening.", "Or, more importantly, communication and not a recording of incoherent shrieking. A voice memo would have been fine if it was her talking.", "But this dad is only away from home 2 days. Suggests that he can control the behaviour."]}
