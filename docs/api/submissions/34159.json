It\u2019s my first time meeting them. They are European and I\u2019m American. The first week or so went fine. I noticed my boyfriend\u2019s niece (4) and nephew (2) were a bit of a handful, but I could understand most of it. The issue started to happen from the second week, particularly from the 4-year old. At first she was super nice to me and I played with her often. But like a switch she started saying she hated me. Again I get that it\u2019s a child and moods happen. And at this time her parents would lightly correct her. \n\nMy issue really started when the 4 year old decided to kick me repeatedly at the zoo. I mean myself just looking at something and her coming up behind me to kick me, with all of her strength. Her parents did nothing and this upset me and my boyfriend greatly. My boyfriend mentioned that his sister commented that I\u2019m \u201cfrom the city and just not used to real children\u2019s behavior\u201d\u2026I was disturbed but tried to be understanding and think about the times the 4-year old was kind. But the behavior continued and it started to build up. \n\nThe breaking point was when we were all playing a board game and the 4-year old randomly threw the board at my face and called me \u201ca fucking asshole.\u201d I was physically hurt and shocked that her mother said absolutely nothing. It was unusual and so disturbing of a no-reaction for something so severe in my opinion. Her mother continued playing the game and told me I needed to hurry up since my turn was next. My boyfriend and his parents were also shocked and upset.\nThe sister, is about two months pregnant with a third child. I decided to excuse myself, to not escalate the situation. I was concerned about upsetting her and causing physical stress. As I left out my boyfriend started talking with his sister and she yells \u201c(4-years old\u2019s name) doesn\u2019t need to apologize, she\u2019s 4 and can say whatever she wants, your girlfriend think she\u2019s smart but she is unintelligent to be upset at anything my daughter does.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a blur but I went back in screaming. What resulted was my boyfriend having a break down from being angry at his sister but also caught in the middle. His sister crying saying \u201cyou\u2019ll never come back here again because you\u2019ll always choose her.\u201d My boyfriend\u2019s parents embarrassed and angry at their daughter. The brother-in-law saying he agrees with my feelings but has to stand by his wife. The 4-year old recognizing the situation was upsetting and coming to me to apologize on her own. And me just mentally exhausted.. I had called her parenting absolutely horrible, which is what I feel strongly. She proceeded to call me an idiot and continued to see it as me upset at her child and not at her. I felt that what I said, given the circumstances, was justified. But everything coupled with my boyfriend\u2019s sadness and anger with his family has me feeling really down and confused about the situation. \n\nWas I wrong here?", "created_utc": 1704192107, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18wmkf9/aita_for_yelling_at_my_boyfriends_sister_for_not/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were completely reasonable expecting a child not to kick or swear or launch things at you", "NTA - but I would be really concerned about how a 4-year-old even knows language like that, as it seems probable that either her parents are using such language with each other - or even worse, at the kid.  I would be shocked at language like that from a kid her age, even without it being directed at myself.  Yes, kids pick up stuff from everywhere, but if the parents don\u2019t feel the need to check it, that seems like a smoking gun regarding where she\u2019s picked it up from.  This is definitely not about a cultural difference (source: am European) - my rather liberal and relaxed parents would not have allowed it (I seem to remember feeling VERY daring for using a word that can best be translated as \u2018drat\u2019 when I was about 8\u2026).", "She\u2019s telling that 4 year old stuff Nta that poor child too", "Easy NTA here. \n\nThat\u2019s terrible parenting. You may not have gone about it perfectly but someone needs to teach the kid actions have consequences. Shocking that a child would ever act that way. It\u2019s also nothing about being city or country. That\u2019s just shitty behaviour and that\u2019s a poor excuse for a parent not to do their job. \n\nTrying not to sound too judgey but she sounds like an awful mum who does absolutely nothing to correct bad behaviour from her kid.", "Easy NTA.\n\nWhen a 4 year old acts out like this, you correct their behavior- and you keep correcting it until it\u2019s cemented in their actions. This just seems like lazy parenting.\n\nWhere is the dad? He could have easily interjected.  There is only so much I\u2019d be willing to ignore with her being pregnant- at some point I\u2019d snap much like you did.", "NTA\n\nA 4-year-old should not be kicking & throwing stuff at you. - Her mom should have told her not to be mean.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>(You're not) \u201cfrom the city and just not used to real children\u2019s behavior.\u201d\n\nThis is NOT an excuse to not control your kids.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\ndo **NOT go on another trip with him**.

Your BF sister needs to take a parenting class or something.", "Errm, excuse me???  A 4 year old can swear and act violently?  That child needs to be shown how to behave correctly, no way is she too young.  NTA", "NTA\n\nAnd you're right about your SIL being a terrible parent. The nieces behaviour is unacceptable.", "Your boyfriend's sister is a horrid mother who will never discipline her kids. I have dealt with such mothers. She is using her pregnancy as an excuse.", "NTA, though I would probably correct the 4-year-old's behavior myself. \n\n>It\u2019s a blur but I went back in screaming. \n\nYeah, that's not healthy. Work on calm assertiveness.", "NTA for sure, I understand that very little children are hyperactive but the parents need to discipline them so they don't do that when they are older. Also throwing a boardgame at someone's face and swearing at them sounds like the behaviour of a drunken 20 year old with anger issues, not a 4 year old. If your boyfriends sister doesn't want to discipline her kids now (or seek help for them if there is an underlying issue) she is gonna regret it when her kids are older and act the same way towards her.", "NTA\n\n  \n\"What resulted was my boyfriend having a break down from being angry at his sister but also caught in the middle.\" .. Your bf is an AH, and needs to grow up. THere is no \"being caught in the middle\", he needs to have your back. HE is an AH to enable their abuse.\n\n  \n**Just leave. Don't stay to let yourself be assaulted and abused. Your bf is the worst AH here, because HE enables them.**", "Maybe it would have been best not to come back screaming. This child has been damaged by poor parenting. It\u2019s not  something you can solve, just avoid.", "NTA - they sound like French parents using the \u201cparentalite positive\u201d and not knowing how to assert boundaries.\n\nNext time maybe don\u2019t come back in screaming. \n\nYour boyfriend would be sad, it\u2019s never a great experience when your family lets you and your chosen one down.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The sister and my boyfriend have a close sibling relationship. And the mother thinks the sister started becoming jealous of me, for many reasons. Indicative of her comments about being educated and stuff.", "The dad is extremely passive and seems to find what she does funny. She was trying to kick him in the face the same day the blow up happened. He is also the one to buy her ice cream and cotton candy when she has a tantrum. :/ My bf was telling me that the brother-in-law was denied sweets when he was little and he doesn\u2019t want his kids to feel that way.

And he was completely on my side, but of course he didn\u2019t want things between me and his sister to get to a physical level, as it nearly did from her side and had she not been pregnant I would absolutely defend myself accordingly. We live in another country together. So tbh we don\u2019t have to be in that situation again, in his home country. His parents really broke down today, worried that I will never want to return again. But the situation is what it is and it\u2019s gonna take me some time to be okay.", "A child is not just gonna say the f word which a 4 year shouldn\u2019t know and no way the 4 year old would know what that meant and just to kick someone yea that sister to telling the 4 year old to do that", "Very unfortunate that it looks like the bad parenting stems from their own experience. However, that does not absolve him from any fault in this.\n\nHe\u2019s effectively enabling this behavior. There isn\u2019t really a way to help either of them in this situation either.. unless they can identify that there is an issue with their parents themselves, you bringing it up will just make them defensive.\n\nBetter to distance yourself from people like this\u2026 at least her parents also realized the issue with her behavior."]}
