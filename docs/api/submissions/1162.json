Within the last two years, my passion for it was reinvigorated; I've been studying it all over again, relearning how the grammar functions, etc. etc. Recently I've gotten a decent hold over the Latin language to the point where I've surpassed the level of \"skill,\" I had previously\u2014which means to say that I can actually translate things now. My skill is not advanced, however; I'm not fluent.\n\nTonight, I noticed for the first time that the Latin she uses is incorrect. I don't want to actually put her handle on here, so I'll make one up that makes the same error: perde.porcus. This is Latin for \"destroy the pig,\" but there's an issue. \"Perde,\" in this sentence, is a command\u2014it's telling you to do something. So far so good. But \"porcus\" is the Latin word for \"pig,\" and here's where the error lies. \n\n\"Perde\" can be best understood like this: \"You, destroy [this].\" It's transitive in this context. And because the verb is *directed* toward something, the pig, the word \"porcus\" should be \"porc*um,*\" the accusative form\u2014not the nominative form (which indicates the subject of the sentence). In plain English, you can make understand it like this: it's the difference between saying \"You, destroy the pig\" and \"You, destroy. Pig.\" The words are not connected in any way.\n\nLong story short, it's just grammatically incorrect. I noticed this, and I kind of want to point it out to her. I don't think she'd be upset. My worry is that if I do, she will not be able to see it the same way again, and at this point it's very close to her brand. Of course, if she wanted to change it, it would only be one letter, but nevertheless, she has had the same username for a long time. But if I don't, she could end up getting further along in her career and getting *truly* stuck with it. Also, in my opinion, it could be like pointing out that someone used \"you're\" wrong, but much worse.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I pointed it out to her?\n\nETA: It's a play on a popular Latin phrase, which I've said in a few comments; this phrase is instantly recognizable to most people.

You wanna point it out because you read Latin or it\u2019s niggling you then yes, you\u2019d be TA", "Thanks for the Latin lesson. NAH", "NTA if you let her know you noticed something about the name and ask if she wants your help. If she doesn\u2019t just leave it alone and have a good chuckle. \n\nAlso were you the one that helped with the original translation? If so it is your duty to inform her of your mistake. \n\nI would like to know but that doesn\u2019t mean she would like criticism especially if she is the one who did the translation.", "Seems like your Latin is decent at best- good chance your translation is wrong \n\nEither way, bringing it up was only going to upset her YTA", "I think you WBTA because it really doesn\u2019t matter. I say this as a mildly pedantic grammar enthusiast.", "I know you're trying to keep a low profile, but she wrote \"Romanes eunt domus\", didn't she?\n\nKidding aside, I wouldn't bring this up. She might laugh it off, but it would probably bug her just enough to resent it. Nothing good gets accomplished, and do you really want to do that to your friend?  It's not hurting anyone as it is.", "Technically, you rare correct, at least as far as the grammar is concerned. So, as far as I'm concerned, NTA. (Just for the record, Porcus actually means piglet, not pig. But this is a common error.", "Good question. I'm not sure there would be. Personally, I would want to know if the Latin I've made my brand is wrong\u2014but it's true that most people wouldn't be able to tell. \n\nI guess currently, it wouldn't have much gain for her. I'm thinking about down the line, when she has a bigger following.", "> Also were you the one that helped with the original translation? If so it is your duty to inform her of your mistake.\n\nNo I wasn't! I think she just used Google Translate or something. I said in a reply to another comment but it's a play on a popular Latin phrase, except she forgot to make the words \"agree\" with each other like they did in the original phrase.", "> Seems like your Latin is decent at best- good chance your translation is wrong\n\nIt's true that I'm not fluent, but making accusative with the verb isn't advanced by any means. It's elementary Latin. If you asked me to translate all of Cicero, I'd be wrong for sure. She's an English speaker, so she can't tell, understandably.\n\n> Either way, bringing it up was only going to upset her YTA\n\nNoted! Though I haven't actually brought it up yet.", "> I know you're trying to keep a low profile, but she wrote \"Romanes eunt domus\", didn't she?\n\nIt says, \"Romans go home!\"\n\n...no it doesn't.\n\n> Kidding aside, I wouldn't bring this up. She might laugh it off, but it would probably bug her just enough to resent it. Nothing good gets accomplished, and do you really want to do that to your friend? It's not hurting anyone as it is.\n\nThis was my worry, and I'm glad to see that I wasn't just being paranoid about it. I wouldn't really want her to resent it.", ">when she has a bigger following\n\nI don\u2019t think the portion of Latin speakers will grow in proportion to her overall following so she should be fine.", "But maybe there's something more complex in the composition you're not advanced enough to know? \n\nIf you bring this to her she's likely going to pay an expert to explain the translation, and if you're wrong you're just going to look bad. \n\nI don't think this is an issue worth bringing up", "It's hard to explain beyond what I've explained in the post, but for an English comparison, it's the difference between \"you're\" and \"your.\" Not super complicated, especially since it's just two words. Her actual handle is a play on a popular Latin phrase with one word switched, except she didn't make the words agree like they do in the original phrase. So I can tell that it's wrong.\n\n> I don't think this is an issue worth bringing up\n\nNoted. I suppose I won't bring it up!"]}
