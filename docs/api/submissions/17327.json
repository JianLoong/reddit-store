To celebrate my Uncle\u2019s Birthday (as he had passed) we are wanting to get married on 27th April next year. I told my family happily, excited to share our desicion and her face dropped on the floor. She demanded there and then that we change when we get married as next year is \u2018her wedding year\u2019. What even is a wedding year ?! I told her no as this is important to us and she stormed upstairs to her room. Later I got texts saying that me and my partner are selfish and cruel and pathetic and disgusting for getting married the same year. I told her this was not fair and that we weren\u2019t getting married anywhere near her time and that we want this time for us. She then said I\u2019m no longer a bridesmaid and that family aren\u2019t so cruel to one another. But I don\u2019t understand the issue?
