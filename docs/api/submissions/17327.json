To celebrate my Uncle\u2019s Birthday (as he had passed) we are wanting to get married on 27th April next year. I told my family happily, excited to share our desicion and her face dropped on the floor. She demanded there and then that we change when we get married as next year is \u2018her wedding year\u2019. What even is a wedding year ?! I told her no as this is important to us and she stormed upstairs to her room. Later I got texts saying that me and my partner are selfish and cruel and pathetic and disgusting for getting married the same year. I told her this was not fair and that we weren\u2019t getting married anywhere near her time and that we want this time for us. She then said I\u2019m no longer a bridesmaid and that family aren\u2019t so cruel to one another. But I don\u2019t understand the issue?

Once you factor in outfits, travel, overnight accommodation, possible babysitters, a wedding gift, etc etc some of the guests invited to both events (I assume there will be many, as you are siblings - including your parents, considering Mother and Father of the bride/groom extras) may not be able to afford to attend both in a relatively short space of time and they may be forced to either struggle financially or choose between you and your brother's weddings. \n\nAdd that in to the fact that you are now getting married first when they've been together longer, I can understand why she might be upset as it may seem like you're stealing their spotlight. I'd say It was a little inconsiderate to do that to your own brother, and I'm sure 27th April the following year would have been free. \n\nAt the same time, no one owns a whole 'year' to get married and ultimately you can choose whatever date you want, even if it puts other people out.
