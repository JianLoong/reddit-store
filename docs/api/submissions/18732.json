As an 8th grade teacher at [School Name], and in my capacity as an advocate for equity and integrity within our educational community, I deem it essential to address this matter in order to ensure transparency and uphold the contractual obligations that have been established.\n\nPrimarily, it is imperative to acknowledge that the cancellation of Movie Day was a consequence of unforeseeable circumstances beyond the control of the school. However, this does not absolve us from the responsibility of fulfilling our obligations to the students and parents who remunerated for this specific activity. The financial agreement entered into with the students and parents necessitated their payment for the opportunity to partake in the movie screening, accompanied by the provision of snacks. Consequently, it is reasonable to expect that any cancellation of the aforementioned event would give rise to an obligation to refund the funds.\n\nI am cognizant of the principal's decision to proffer tumbler mugs as an alternative, which may have been undertaken with good intentions, as it exemplifies a gesture of goodwill. Nevertheless, it does not align with the financial agreement that was originally established. The provision of an alternative item, irrespective of its thoughtfulness, fails to fulfill our obligation to refund the monetary sums that were remitted for the specific event.\n\nMoreover, it is inappropriate to place the onus upon parents to express their dissatisfaction and actively request a refund. As educators, it is incumbent upon us to proactively address such matters and ensure that fairness is preserved. By effectuating automatic refunds, we demonstrate our commitment to transparency, integrity, and accountability.\n\nI respectfully request that you reconsider your decision and prioritize the fulfillment of our financial obligations to the students and parents involved. It is crucial to maintain trust and foster open communication within our school community, particularly when pecuniary matters are implicated. I firmly believe that by dispensing the promised refunds, we will not only reinstate confidence but also exhibit our commitment to placing the needs and interests of our students and their families at the forefront.\n\nShould you necessitate any supplementary information or desire to engage in further discussions regarding this matter, I am available for a meeting at your convenience. I am confident that through a prompt and equitable resolution of this issue, we can cultivate a positive environment that prioritizes fairness and upholds the integrity of our school.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.

I don\u2019t work for one.", "This makes me so happy. \n\nTo be honest, I'd hate for your students to lose such a bad ass advocate for them, but especially pleased you're covered. \n\nI'm so looking forward to the update(s).", "Fellow public education teacher (UT). I love this, \u201cwe ride at dawn\u201d attitude. We need so much more of this!!", "Please consider coming to teach in New Mexico.", "Yass! I love this \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f. \n\nPlease keep us updated. And of course, NTA.", "Wtf?!?! This is at a title 1 school?! I would be outraged at this at a private school! My kids go to a regular public school in a good district and we wouldn\u2019t be charged for any of this. They\u2019re making kids pay to go to their own graduation ceremony???", "That is the shadiest list ever - would love to see the accounting in this.  No way the school isn\u2019t profiteering here - the latest no refund example is just them pushing it even further.\nDocument, report, and fight!  Rooting for you Op!!", "Something is definitely up. What happens if students\u2019 families can\u2019t pay for all of this? I taught at a title one school and then a school on the opposite end of the spectrum. Even the rich school wouldn\u2019t charge that much. The board needs to look into the books at your school for sure. If they don\u2019t since I saw you are ready for a fight, contact union or whistle blower agency in your state then the media", "Oh and please add this info to your post if you can.", "This is criminal! $15 for breakfast, in a Title 1 school where many/most are on free/reduced lunch?!? Make sure the School Board sees this- but if you can, get a parent to call the media.", "80 students x almost $100 for all activities is definitely looking at fraud if not more.", "Doesnt matter, that's your job. \n\nIf your personal views clash with your job responsibilities, that is your problem.", "So your argument acknowledges one of my premises (the principal is in the wrong) and then goes nowhere else. Other than abuse, that is.    \n\n\nNow try engaging with the central argument...   \n\n\nThat the leadership/management of the organisation sets the organisation's position, and it is staff's job to advocate for it, even if they disagree. Even if it's wrong.", "Yes, as I said \"the principal is wrong\".   \n\n\nThat, however, was not my main point. Want to try addressing the central point?", "No.\n\nThat would give any teacher the right to put their personal political/social views (abortion? gun control? whatever else is controversial in your particular part of the world? just imagine someone who is a genuine advocate for the opposite of whatever it is you believe) above the organisation's position.\n\nThat is not how organisations work.", "Who probably embezzled some of the money. Tumbler mugs in bulk don't cost $15 each.", "Agreed. I have dollar store mugs that are still in great shape and not faded.", "That's what I was thinking! I went to a fairly nice high school and there's no chance in hell they would've charged $15 for something like this. That price is INSANE for what it was! Especially at a school with a large demographic of underprivileged kids, wtf!", "Given what's going on in this scenario I am highly doubtful there was any licensing involved in this screening.", "I did the math too it was $1,200 in tickets and if the mugs in bulk are say $5 apiece, then $5 times 80 is $400 then it's still $800 left over after buying the 80 mugs. And from a quick search in Florida it's a felony if it's over $750. Take this with a grain of salt as what I searched might be outdated. But you might want to report this to the police as well....", "The principal will suspect OP for sure but\u2026 this is 80 whole kids who are getting screwed. Any one of them or their parents can reach out to the school board or the media. If OP is careful, there would be no way to prove it was them.", "Most southern states do not have unions. Right-to-work reigns supreme.", "Showing the movie that the kids paid for is not money laundering. Neither is using the money to buy mugs and keeping the difference. There is no illegally obtained money to be laundered. \n\nThere have been entire television shows devoted to this topic.", "I feel like misappropriation of funds would be the better call.", "That's the same definition, just worded differently. \n\nThere are no illegally obtained funds so there's nothing to launder. Thus it's not money laundering. Thus the statement is incorrect.", "Yeah disguise the source. She\u2019s not disguising the source of the funds she\u2019s stealing them.", "Best money ever.", "That's actually good  Then the parents can say thank you very much for this lovely gift. And then ask for the 15$ back.", "I\u2019ve got screenshots of the email the bookkeeper sent when she was selling the mugs to faculty.", "If your boss/employer is doing something reprehensible, or possibly illegal, it's your responsibility to report it. Not doing so is a failure as a human being, which always trumps your relationship with or responsibility to to your employer.\n\nAlways.", "\u201cIt is staff\u2019s job to advocate for it. Even if it\u2019s wrong\u201d\n\nUmm no. Standing up against things that are wrong can help weed out and call out corrupt management.", "I was thinking the same - she probably paid $5 and is pocketing the difference.  Please report this to the school board.", "Good call $15 of 80 students is $1,200. That a good amount of money.", "Yes. 100%. I can't really see any other reason than that she already spent the money", "I don\u2019t think Disney really cares what goes on in Florida\u2026", "It's raising someones funds alright. Even without the cancellation. Snacks don't cost 15$. The question is who's?", "Excellent point. Shut it down with an intimidating hour long lecture and hope OP walks away with their tail between their legs.", "You\u2019re a good teacher. Thank you for watching out for these families. It\u2019s sad that the principal is taking advantage of them.", "That\u2019s great. I may sound paranoid but I just wanna make sure you are covered in case the principal tries to take anything out on you. I truly hope that\u2019s not the case and I think you are great for sticking up for those kids and their parents.", "Step 1: Buy a bunch of crappy mugs in bulk for $3 each\n\nStep 2: Reimburse yourself the $15 you supposedly spent on said mugs\n\nStep 3: Pocket the $960 left over", "Probably the principal. You can get tumblers at dollar tree for $5 each- and probably cheaper off of Amazon. \n\n$10/per kid is a hefty bit of change", "I saw this: \n\n>Teachers Union would have a field day if that ever happened.\n\nand was like hell yeah! \n\nThen you two shattered it.", "yeah, Desantis will probably find a way to make unions illegal.", "Sounds to me if the movie was cancelled last minute, and principal decided to refund in tumbler mugs so quickly, it\u2019s because they we\u2019re already on hand\u2026. So where IS the money?", "They don't. I live in florida with friends in the school system. They do not have a good union here.", "not a teacher but unions are barley a thing here in general (FL). years of propaganda has made it so the average worker here thinks they're somehow a bad thing, it's genuinely embarrassing to live here sometimes", "We don\u2019t. Texas. They can fire you or not renew your contract with zero repercussions. People need to know this.", "its a shit show here and it's disingenuous to pretend otherwise.", "PLEASE keep us posted if you\u2019re able to.", "Not just embarrassing but dangerous if you're LGBT or a POC", "It isn\u2019t where we live.  I understand it is really crazy in Duval County however.  Anyone from Florida knows Duval always seems to have something going on and if it isn\u2019t them for a change it\u2019s Palm Beach.", "yeah I'm trans and it's awful here ngl. a significant amount of my friends have either moved or are trying to and I don't think I'll be far behind", "Good luck relocating! Stay safe.\n\nWish the world wasn't like this that this is a reasonable thing to wish someone :("]}
