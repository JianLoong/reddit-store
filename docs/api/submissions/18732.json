She's taking that $1200 and using it for something.......", "NTA and I\u2019d look into the purchase price of the mug and the difference between that and $15, AND who owns the company that makes the mugs. You could have caught quite the scam.", "NTA...a $5 mug is not a good swap for a $15 refund. Sounds like the principal is pocketing the money to me. Especially since it sounds like she's defending integrity you never actually called into question. When people get that defensive, it's been my experience they're not entirely legit.", "NTA. Parents didn\u2019t buy a mug. They bought a movie day for the kids. The mugs can be a \u201cmy bad\u201d from the school but the parents deserve their money back. Period.", "NTA\n\nThank you for standing up for your students and their families. We live in a title one area and for many families, $15 is a lot of money but that's the whole issue here. \n\nThe right thing to do is either reschedule and if that isn't possible, refund the kids. \n\nThe parents should not have to call and ask for a refund, that is just plain ridiculous.", "I\u2019d be pretty pissed if I got a mug in this situation", "NTA\n\nI would not be satisfied with a mug in place of cash refund.

School needs to refund the money.", "She doesn't have any integrity. She sold the students a movie and popcorn, got screwed over by the school board (it's Florida. Probably the movie she chose has one character mentioning the fact that gay people exist or something.), and now thinks she has the right to give them a mug instead.\n\nCan anyone spell \"bait and switch\"?\n\nYou're right, and she's an asshole. Refunds should be automatic. She wouldn't know what integrity was if she was buried neck-deep in a pile of it.\n\nAny student wishing to purchase a school mug for $15 presumably has that option.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI don't get it, so she had previously ordered the mugs as a party favor to take after you watch a movie? or did she magically had everything ordered and delivered in a matter of hours after the movie was cancelled?

The parents are expecting it back so they aren\u2019t complaining yet. Let the school board know & tell the kids to tell their parents he won\u2019t give them their money back. If this was a fundraiser it\u2019s illegal to use the money for anything other than it\u2019s intended purpose. Is it going through the PTA?", "NTA\n\nIf it's not the fault of the kids, and is only because the School district either didn't approve the movie selection or didn't approve it on time, means the entire fault belongs to the District.  In the least, notice should go to the parents giving them a choice of a refund or a tumbler.  If the principal is correct and the parents prefer the mug, then the only thing the Principal needed to do was send the notice.  If it turns out she's wrong, the parties with no fault (the kids & their parents) get their money back.  The KEY is provide accurate information and give them the choice.", "NTA. They paid for the movie day, which didn't happen. They weren't asked and weren't given the option of the mug. That's like me being sent to the store with $15 for chocolate and coming back with trail mix. Yeah, some people might like it, but there's plenty who won't and also probably plenty of kids/ parents who won't kick up a stink because they don't know a refund could have been or could still be an option. Given the socio-economic status of the kids that are in your school, $15 could be a big thing for them. If the school said that they had already spent $X on snacks, which were still given to the kiddos and then only a partial refund could be given, even that would be fairer, but to decide all the kids want a mug (or anything else) is just bogus.", "NTA. She thinks the parents should be the one complaining? Give her just that! When contacting the district board, get as many parents on as possible. That way, they can't ignore it or something", "NTA\n\nI'd be pissed over that. A movie is what was paid for, and a tumbler will become something I'd use for a school window in response. Your principal lacks decency and ethics, and should not be in charge of young minds. Keep pushing for the parents, please. \n\nAlso, it'd be the last time I'd pay for any other activities at the school, since the administration is not trustworthy.", "NTA and what did she do with all of the money? Because I\u2019d bet those tumblers were already sitting around somewhere.", "NTA. Have a parent mention contacting a lawyer and see how fast they refund the money.", "Take it allll the way on this. Everyone wants cash. \n\nIf your principal thinks people wants free mugs, let us know where all of Reddit can send the surplus of cheap freebie mugs in their pantries. \n\nNTA.", "INFO: Are you aware of any specific parents or children that have expressed frustration with this?\n\nLike... You're not wrong really. If I was one of these kids I also would not be super happy about this.\n\nBut... your position here is weird. Like, you're not an aggrieved party, you're not even doing this on behalf of anyone who came to you looking for help resolving this. Heck, you aren't even directly implicated as someone who made any of these decisions nor was it your job to make these decisions.\n\nYou're just sort of stepping in and making a lot of noise over a perceived injustice without anyone asking you to step in for them.
