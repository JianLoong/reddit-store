Include the 1-hour berating that you received whereby the principal *paid someone else to cover your class* as part of it.

Go to the district because this is corrupt.", "And that's not a conflict of interest or anything, of course.\n\nFor the love of all that's holy, escalate this beyond your school. This is looking more and more like a straight up scam and kickback arrangement.", "Please report this to the school board, the parents, and think about going to the media.", "Lol this is the sort of shit that got my middle school principal jailed.\n\nAt least he only embezzled school funds to have a hot steamy affair with the librarian like he was corrupt but she bought books for the school library with the money we were supposed to go on school trips with.", "Given this, I bet that the principal planned to give the mugs/tumblers out at the movie night -- that the principal was going to claim that this was both to prevent paper/plastic waste from the cups the kids would use while drinking beverages and, if logoed, a commemorative item from the event.  Basically, a kickback to the bookkeeper's company that looks just legitimate enough for an end of 8th grade event.\n\nSince she already spent the money on the tumblers, when the movie night was cancelled, she had a bunch of tumblers and about 1/3 of the money left (best case scenario, for food)-- not enough to offer refunds..  So somehow tumblers become refunds?\n\nIt's sketchy.  And if the movie night hadn't been cancelled, she would have gotten away with it.  And they always claim it's going to subsidize other 8th grade events for the students who couldn't afford it, but never see any actual accounting of that.", "It was going to be money laundering when the movie was still on schedule, and now that it\u2019s cancelled the refund is difficult because the money has *already* been laundered. That\u2019s my read on it anyway.", "These are middle school kids. The teacher is in 8th grade. I don't think I know a middle school kid who doesn't use mugs - they all drink tea or coffee or hot chocolate or something.

I applauded you for standing up for the kids on this.\n\nNTA!", ">idk how vigilant your parents are in reading your communications but it might also be a good option to send your students home with a note \u201cthe principal is offering full refunds for any parent who wants one. the office # is\u2026\u201d i agree the onus shouldnt be on the parents but $15 aint nothin and they may need that money back asap. i would also move forward with your current plan to get escalate. you are ofc, NTA. and your principal is the one casting the shadow on their own integrity, not you. integrity is doing the right thing. the principal doesnt even seem to know what the right thing is.\n\nDo you have proof the bookkeeper sells the mug? A social media page with their name attached? I would screenshot that real quick incase they take it down and try to pretend it was just a random company.", "OMG, report this to someone, or ideally get someone else to under their own name, since the principal is already mad at you. That's *super shady*.", "It\u2019s really shady that these are mugs sold by then bookkeeper. That said, it is a painful process I\u2019m sure and they probably don\u2019t want to do it 80 times. They still should do 80 times though because it\u2019s the right thing to do.", "I agree but I also know it is virtually impossible to get someone fired for something like this. \n\nIn my state only PTO. PTA and ASB can handle funds like this. I am surprised there aren't similar rules.

I would pay $15 to not watch *Avatar.*", "Please tell me you got into all the wrongs in detail with the school board....in detail. It sounds like more than just the.kods who missed a movie day deserve a refund.\n\nEdit: I just want to add I've been reading this thread. I have a cousin in a low income middle school in Florida. Your responses are giving me hope.", "This is just offensive", "Just last week?!? That would never fly at any school I\u2019ve worked at. Good on you for being willing to fight this one and to fight to the end.", "I commented on the main but also went through and read your comments and this is ILLEGAL. I would get in contact with the source of your Title 1 funds-typically the state department of education.

Because at least it\u2019s quick.", "There are better teaching jobs everywhere right now. Huge teacher shortage.", "Yup, makes sense why the principal blew it out of proportion when confronted, too.", "Our school is a really affluent district and no one would ever pay $15 for something so stupid. Highway robbery. Those poor kids", "Right? We had movie days my senior year once we were done with the curriculum. It cost us nothing. We brought our own snacks.", "Oooh. Yup. Thats conflict of interest.", "Some don't have a union at all.", "Especially considering this is Florida", "It better be a movie in an actual movie theater not $15 for a VHS showing, cold pizza and warm soda. That money went somewhere and it wasn\u2019t to this event.", "Please update as this moves along!", "I pay $20 a month for a movie a day each month. $15 is crazy.", "I was kind of thinking the same thing. I feel like I read somewhere that a lot of the southern states do not have strong (or any) unions. I could totally be remembering it wrong though.", "Hi, from Florida.  My district has an amazing union that fights for the teachers.  It got us two raises to get us above another local small district and it stopped some of the unnecessary and overwhelming teacher grading policies in their tracks.   I\u2019m getting really tired of the crappy comments about Florida just because of what someone in government is doing.  FYI the book ban is nothing like how it is being shown on tv.", "The teachers unions in Florida are about as useful as a paper umbrella in a hurricane. Which isn\u2019t their fault. We\u2019re in an at-will state and most counties are year-to-year contracts anyway, so all the seniority protections have gone the way of the dodo bird. \n\nSo when someone like acts this principal, the union basically shrugs and says \u201cyeah, that sucks, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d", "Ok, will do!"]}
