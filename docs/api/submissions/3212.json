However, it\u2019s 9 months out, could you have gently given them a deadline?  Ie., also planning a trip with the girls, want to firm up dates, so would you be able to let me know by xyz?", "NTA.\n\nPlan a vacation and then book it. Belaboring it for weeks isn't fair, especially since they knew you were trying to plan another one.", "These aren\u2019t your in laws. They are your boyfriend\u2019s family.", "These aren\u2019t your in laws. Their your BFs parents, and they are all being weirdly demanding over a vacation.  If they want you, then they can pick a date. You don\u2019t have to put your life on hold while waiting for them to make a decision. You\u2019re 20. Tell your BF to have fun, and you\u2019ll see him when you both get back from your trips. Go have fun with your friends. \n\nAnd the way your bf acts will help you decide if you should find somebody else to plan trips with instead of him. \n\nNTA", "Super soft YTA. Asking you to block out an entire month because they can't figure it out? No. You've already told him you're going on vacation with your friends before (or at the start) of their family vacation planning.\n\nHere's TA part: You should have pre-warned him that you can't block out a whole month (if you did, then you're NTA). Might also should have said that your friend vacation was just as important to you as his families vacation is to him.", "UPD: YTA\n\nYou were invited to a holiday, with reasonably clear time ranges. You did not communicate your issues, such as having other stuff to book (eg my friends are inviting me on a trip, I need to book asap, can we book this one so I can hook the other one?).\n\nInfo: did you communicate your issues to them?", "YTA. He repeatedly asked you to keep it free for a FREE vacation, and without even discussing your concerns about the other vacation, you just booked it? And are they your in-laws or the bf\u2019s parents? And doesn\u2019t sound like you are flexible.", "Honestly, no. Hies nephew takes up ALL his attention, probably leaving me by myself. His nephew is 18 btw", "Yes, the vacation with my friends was booked three weeks ago. As no one ever directly told me anything about the vacation, all communication went through my bf. I assume that he told them, but they probably do not care as much if I am there. It just makes me wonder why there is so much drama with me not being able to come then.", "I am sorry if I did not explain it well, they booked their vacation during the vacation I had already booked. So I am not able to go with them.", "I have never thought about deadlines though, could have done that.", "Yes, correct. Only in my culture we say this as it is easier and you are often regarded as family even when not married (yet).", "Yes, I told him several times that I was not able to block out an entire month for something that would only take a week. I am sorry if I did not make this clear. He does not understand that this vacation is as important to me, because he expects me to put his family above my friends while they are not even nice to me.", "Not directly, I agree that I maybe should have, but they never directly communicated anything to me. My bf just gave me all information and nobody asked me anything. I found it hard to start to them about my demands when nobody asked me anything.", "The bf\u2019s parents. I discussed my concerns with him, just not with him family as I was never really involved in the decisions which were made.", "Cool, then don't go, stick with what you have booked.  \n\nPossibly also tell him what you just told me, he might not realise what a drag it would be for you.", "Ohhhh, never rely on the bf to communicate info.

But you've already told him July is out, and August is in and that you're not blocking out a whole month.\n\nI don't see how he could expect you to drop boundaries for a 1 year relationship and family who doesn't treat you as such (yet anyway \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f).\n\nI'm adding to this:\nI've declined several \"FREE\" vacations with my own family because they either didn't plan it in a timely manner, their time frame didn't align with mine, or because they're just crappy family. \n\nTo say OP should have gone because it's free is dumb. Free trash is still trash.", "Sounds more like ESH if they were just putting it off.", "I told him before, but he tells me that it is not true.", "I will not anymore now", "I am honestly starting to feel like this, but they are saying that it is because the residence they want is only available at that time.", "This is also my pov, I feel like I am supposed to do everything his family wants me to or otherwise I am the bad guy.", "Putting what off exactly? Booking the vacation?", "So he doesn't respect your opinions and his parents don't like you (from your other response).\n\nYour holiday with friends keeps sounding better and better.", "I hate the expectation that boys are just not capable of communicating and planning and it's the girl's job. He's 24. If he didn't tell them that, he fucked up, and these are the easily foreseeable consequences that he can accept, get over it, and do better next time. Don't accept weaponized incompetence, if that's all it is.\n\nIf it is legitimately unfortunate circumstances - they really expected early August and the place really isn't available then and they dragged their feet (or weren't able for other reasons) to book, even knowing you have something else you were trying to line up... well, then, it's a shame, but they should gracefully accept you can't make it.", "Ofcourse they say that. Of they say that they prefer to go on vacation without you, they are the bad guys. Now you are! Win win for them", "I'm going to assume you've known your friends far longer than his family. I would tell him they mean the same to you as his family does to him. My best friend from high school is my kids' aunt (I'm the only girl my parents had). She is family to me, and I'd drop almost anything for her.", "Yes. Like if they COULD have booked it sooner, but just didn\u2019t want to pick, that\u2019s different than if they weren\u2019t able to bc they didn\u2019t have the availability yet.", "Well, same for me. I am happy with my decision, thank you.", "Yes, I always do the planning and make sure that I communicate everything well. He said that I should just directly communicate to his family about this, as he is not good at it. I feel like I would overstep, telling them my demands.", "Yeah, sad story. I am not that bothered by them anymore, it is just that my bf sides with them.", "I have known these friends for about five years, so yes, longer than I have known his family.", "Yes, they were putting it off. They were already busy with this months ago but could not make a decision", "I'd go with friends. Sounds like it will be a more relaxing and less judgemental atmosphere.", "You should have gone directly to them. So I will go with ESH which is better than my original YTA lol.", "Thank you, yes they are very judgemental so there was no way that I could do it right for them", "Fair enough. I think I could have, it was just hard for me as they never said anything about it directly to me. It felt weird for me to start demanding things when no one asked me to. But I will keep this in mind, thank you.", "You never said anything to them, either. If you had, maybe they would have been like oh, then we\u2019ll book first week of august. Always better to be upfront in these situations. Live and learn!", "I will, thank you!", "NTA, you would be an asshole to the people you already made plans with to ditch them entirely to just follow the control of people who don't respect you. You need to look at this and take in that this is entirely just for control. Don't jump when they tell you to", "NTA. It is entirely understandable that your friends (who made plans in a timely manner) are a priority over potential future ILs that dragged their feet and waited until the last minute to make a solid plan. Is your bf always hypercritical of your decisions?", "NTA your actions were completely logical. Trying you to keep the entire August free, in order to wait on a decision from them, was unreasonable and didn't allow you leeway to make your own plans with friends. Sounds like bf puts his family over you, watch out for him making you a slave to his family.", "Nta", "NTA \n\nThey did a piss poor job of communicating their vacation plans to you and now you've made other plans. Too bad, so sad. They will live. Just because you're in a relationship doesn't mean you have to be tied at the hip. He can do his thing, and you can do yours. No apologies needed. Your time on this earth is yours to do as you wish.", "NTA. If you'd wanted to make travelling with your BF of a year and his family the priority, you would have. You chose your friends of 5 years.\n\nAnd in all honesty, at your age and the age of your relationship, that was probably the best choice\n\nAs for the communication issue, I think the failures there were solely on your BF. You should have been able to trust that he would communicate properly in both directions.\n\nAnd call me cynical, but I suspect that he *chose* to not communicate your potential conflict to his family. He knew that you wanted to travel with your friends, and July wasn't an option for that. He was telling you \"keep August open\". Which isn't exactly saying that he didn't want you travelling with your friends. But it *is* saying that he didn't care if travelling with your friends would happen.\n\nIf he has cared about that, there were multiple efforts he could have made to facilitate resolve the conflict. If he didn't care about your other plans, there would have been no reason to make the effort to say anything to his family, because to him, those other plans didn't matter.\n\nSaying \"keep the month open\" fits with the latter. He wanted travelling with his family to be the priority. He didn't want to make the effort to deal with a potential conflict. Keeping the month open was easier.\n\nAs for the whole \"not being flexible\" thing, that's bs. Being flexible had nothing to do with it. You had two competing sets of plans going on. At some point, you had to choose. What they're really saying is \"how dare you not wait for us to get around to making our plans and working completely with our schedule\".", "ESH Y\u2019all and the comments sound weird \n\n\u201cHe told me then that we would probably go in either the first or the second week of August, but that I should try to not plan anything in August\u201d \n\nHe literally said probably which means he didn\u2019t know for sure and also asked her to not plan anything for august and she acting like and agreeing with comments that they meant to leave her out even though he said to try not to book anything and august because of it\n\nAnd based off your comments you didn\u2019t want to go on a trip anyway \n\nHis family has no right to be mad about you going on a trip with your friends and you need to stop acting like they leaving you out on purpose when he literally said try not to book anything for august you all are just childish and don\u2019t know how to plan", "NTA. Forget them. Enjoy your vacation with your friends.", "About the in-law thing: in my culture we already say this when not married as it is easier and you are often regarded as family even when not married yet. Thank you for the advice, will do that.", "Hold your ground. It is not reasonable for ANYONE to expect you to set aside an entire month out of your 6 weeks of vacation for their own scheduling issues. \n\nGo have fun with your friends. You'll have more fun with them then with his family anyway.", "What is your \u201cculture\u201d", ">Ohhhh, never rely on the bf to communicate info. Just\u2026don\u2019t.\n\nIt's his family. His job to communicate with them.", "Oh, he sounds like he's just a real treat.", "Well, we see how that worked out.", ">He said that I should just directly communicate to his family about this, as he is not good at it.\n\nNo.  It's his family.  If he's not willing to talk to them, why should you be?", "NTA He said probably 1st or 2nd week of August and you planned accordingly.  Sorry, but putting a whole month on hold while waiting for others to make up their minds is just not feasible. \n Who actually really wants to vacation with their in laws anyway?", "NTA. You\u2019re not a member of that family. You\u2019ve only been together a year. You shouldn\u2019t have to give up time with your friends to placate them. You don\u2019t need to be flexible because they\u2019re not a priority. Your life can\u2019t revolve around their schedule.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey are AHs. YOur own life is more important thab being their dressed monkey that needs to be on call for them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are fine not to go on vacations with your in laws. Go with your friends, that was booked earlier. And that will be the much better experience anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: Why would you even consider doing vacations with your inlaws? Do you really enjoy those?", "NTA. That said, those people aren\u2019t your in-laws, they\u2019re merely your BF\u2019s parents and should be referred to as such unless you\u2019re married.", "And the boyfriend can spend all the time with his nephew that he says he doesn\u2019t spend the time with.", "It sounds like she knows how to plan. She had two trips, both of which had to be in August, one of which was 'probably' in the first half. So she found a week that all the friends could go which was NOT either of those two weeks, and then the family picked her week anyway.\n\nIs she supposed to wait indefinitely for the family to decide, when she has multiple friends who need to make their plans as well?", "That was what i was thinking. He clearly stated not all August. As far as I'm concerned, August includes the last week of August. Sometimes you have to choose. I had a similar problem but with different groups of friends. I was delaying a group while waiting to a another so i made the adult decision to say to one, sorry i wont make it and everything was ok. Not a big deal. ESH.", "Yeah, somehow I always upset him with decisions which seems reasonable to me.", "You are also just together for one year. And with his attitude, i actually don't believe you are still together next year in august. So prioritize your friends.", "INFO\n\nIs the BF doing other things to isolate you from your friends or family?", "No, she has to choose. She chose her friends. That's all.", "Is there a reason why he gave you what like 10 months notice about a trip happening sometime  in august and you had to book a friend trip 9 months in advance for the same month?", "Don't rely on the husband either. I've learned this the hard way.", "I am dutch", "So let HIM go with them alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSimply refuse to go on family vacations with the in-laws. MOST people do that.", "> but he tells me that it is not true.\n\nNothing like having an SO that denies you your own reality.  Good luck.", "So he gaslights you and disregards your feelings? Dump him.", "That\u2019s a lesson most if not all women learn", "Me:  what are you talking\nHim:  I told you we were going\nMe: I\u2019m your dreams maybe", "that doesnt mean its her problem to solve going forward. thats a BF problem", "Let me rephrase then: don\u2019t rely on others to communicate for you, because they probably won\u2019t do it properly, and then you\u2019re half to blame for miscommunication.", "She\u2019s on here because she\u2019s got\u2026problems from this lol. There\u2019s a lot of \u2018they never communicated with me\u2019 when they could say the same about her. I don\u2019t see anyone taking any personal accountability here and a bunch of passing the blame. People can be as much of a victim as they choose to be.", "Then he needs to practice communicating like a big boy."]}
