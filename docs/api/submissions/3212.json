Too bad, so sad. They will live. Just because you're in a relationship doesn't mean you have to be tied at the hip. He can do his thing, and you can do yours. No apologies needed. Your time on this earth is yours to do as you wish.", "NTA. If you'd wanted to make travelling with your BF of a year and his family the priority, you would have. You chose your friends of 5 years.\n\nAnd in all honesty, at your age and the age of your relationship, that was probably the best choice\n\nAs for the communication issue, I think the failures there were solely on your BF. You should have been able to trust that he would communicate properly in both directions.\n\nAnd call me cynical, but I suspect that he *chose* to not communicate your potential conflict to his family. He knew that you wanted to travel with your friends, and July wasn't an option for that. He was telling you \"keep August open\". Which isn't exactly saying that he didn't want you travelling with your friends. But it *is* saying that he didn't care if travelling with your friends would happen.\n\nIf he has cared about that, there were multiple efforts he could have made to facilitate resolve the conflict. If he didn't care about your other plans, there would have been no reason to make the effort to say anything to his family, because to him, those other plans didn't matter.\n\nSaying \"keep the month open\" fits with the latter. He wanted travelling with his family to be the priority. He didn't want to make the effort to deal with a potential conflict. Keeping the month open was easier.\n\nAs for the whole \"not being flexible\" thing, that's bs. Being flexible had nothing to do with it. You had two competing sets of plans going on. At some point, you had to choose.

He clearly stated not all August. As far as I'm concerned, August includes the last week of August. Sometimes you have to choose. I had a similar problem but with different groups of friends.

Your boyfriend is showing all of us, at least, very clearly, that he does not and will not make you a priority. His family comes first, and when you (quite understandably) point it out to him, his reaction isn't to discuss with you how to balance the scales, or how o make you feel prioritized; it's to tell you that your feelings are wrong and by the way not only are you wrong you should moreover cancel your own plans for HIS convenience.\n\nYou're NTA but you're kind of being an asshole to yourself by settling for this guy.

I\u2019ve been in a similar situation before and lost out completely on vacation because people took too long. So now, I do what I have to do and if people can\u2019t understand that\u2026 well that\u2019s their problem.", "INFO  \n\nDid you give any answer when your bf asked you not to plan anything? \n\nDid you tell your bf you planned the vacation with your friends? Either before or after?", "NTA no one is entitled to your time", "OP=NTA\n\nyou have right to schedule any vacation you want, asking a person to keep four weeks open for a vacation that is not 4 weeks is a bit much.\n\nCan you split the difference, spend part of the time with friends and part with family. \n\nDO you even want to spend the total time with boyfriend of ONE years' family?", "NTA\nIf this relationship pans out, there's always next year for his family to plan a vacation trip you could join. If it doesn't pan out, missing this single opportunity is a blessing.\n\nYou, and your friends, all put your plans on hold for as long as you could stand. Then you used the scraps of info you were given to pick the least likely week to conflict with their \"not decided\" plan. Every one of you compromised and CHANGED WHAT YOU WERE DOING to your discomfort, to accommodate his family. Not just you. Your friends were also inconvenienced and discomfited by resisting their comfortable timelines in planning ahead of time to accommodate the family's \"prolly around the beginning, but who knows? So just wait to plan around us while we fail to plan.\"\n\nYou guys just couldn't keep waiting, and that's okay. You have boundaries about how much of your autonomy, comfort and safety you're willing to give up. And to who. And for how long.\nHis family is inconsiderate, intrusive and demanding to assume you will put your life on hold to be the moth to their boy's flame for as long as they feel like it. They don't appreciate the energy and effort you AND your friends sacrificed trying to accommodate their unreasonable demands. That effort is not only not appreciated, but spurned as only what's to be expected, and not enough.", "NTA - he 'told' you not to plan anything for 2/3 of your vacation while his family sorted out their vacation?\n\nWhat did he think you would do for those 4 weeks ? Would you ever issue such an instruction to him? the idea is ridiculous !!\n\nthey believe you should be so gratetful to be included in their group that you have nothing else to do with your time but hang around in the summer?  If they had booked earlier, everything would have been better.  They could have said 'we are going for Week X' and you could say that you are or are not avaialble \n\nWhy is going away with these people so imporant to him? is it an audition?  If it is then they have failed it", "Mta. Go with your friends", "NTA.  You are 20.  He is 24. Dating one year.  Not engaged or married.   They are NOT your in-laws You asked a couple times, never agreed to hold 4 of 6 weeks or pass on a vacation with fiends. \n\n\nYou are not the rude one here. When you invite someone you give dates and don\u2019t request someone hold an entire month.  Grown ass adults do better.  \n\nGlad self absorbed folks who can\u2019t plan accordingly when someone else also has plans makes them not flexible. \n\nMaybe next year if they can plan better.  You have every right to plan your own travels and you have plenty of heads up to boyfriend.", "Okay so they never communicated anything about this directly to me, all communication went through my bf. I did tell my bf several times that I was waiting for his family to make a decision and that my friends really wanted to book.", "This actually makes me a little suspicious about the whole \u2018it only being available that week\u2019. I think you BF might have told them and they decided, because they didn\u2019t want you there to do it that week so they could put all the blame on you for not coming. Besides this you BF knew you had plans, if he really cared about you coming he would have suggested alternative accommodation so they could go earlier in august (like he said they would) so you could go with. Honestly he doesn\u2019t sound like a very caring boyfriend, best off choosing your friends over him anyway.\n\nNTA", "Well, not a case of prioritizing one over the other for you, but it was for him.. and he cared 100% about his priority and not at all about ensuring you also got to do what you had been planning for a while.", "Ohhhh, never rely on the bf to communicate info. Just\u2026don\u2019t.", "That is true, he would not care if I was not able to go on my girls trip", "That\u2019s called gaslighting.  He denies it happened and tries to convince you it didn\u2019t so you feel like it\u2019s your fault and take blame. \n\nHate to tell you but however nice you seem to think he is - this behavior is beyond destructive.  It will make you second guess yourself, he will take control and belittle you until you believe everything he says and think you are crap.\n\nEdit was to correct misspelled word.", "Wow, I feel stupid but I guess you are right. He is taking the easy way out, trying to make me think he is siding with me while he is not", "Per him.  Not per you.  He says it.  Probably not one thing is wrong with you.  Good luck.", "Nope. Nip this right now! You had your plans. He's a boyfriend not a fiance or husband. You shouldn't have to put your life on hold to accommodate them. Usually big group trips are planned in advance. Not sure of the game or test but don't play it and start boundary setting from now. The honeymoon is over hun. NTA. Go have  guilt free fun with your friends.", "NTA", "NTA, you can\u2019t block off an entire month of someone else\u2019s time, period.", "NTA and what? Lack of planning on your part is not an emergency on my part. They didn\u2019t plan. You did.", "NTA.", "NTA.\nThey're being unreasonable.\nEnjoy your vacation.", "NTA... enjoy your vacation with your friends. These trips may dissapear if things progress w your bf", "How can he possibly tell you what you are thinking is not what you are thinking?", "Eh disagreeing with someones opinion is not the same as not respecting.\n\nI can disagree with someones opinion but still respect it. \n\nIf I said Lavar Ball is the goat basketball player, or Michael Jordan is the goat baseball player and you/people disagreed would that be disrespecting my opinion?\n\nOp said nephew takes up \"ALL his time\" so unless they never spend a few moments together that is not true. \n\nCould nephew take up most/majority maybe, that is believable, but ALL of the time unlikely .", "Exactly!", "NTA. your friends needed you to commit and his parents were delaying in booking, which led to the only availability for them to be the same time that you booked.", "NTA. Were you supposed to just wait and wait until the blast minute? What if your vacation time was denied because someone else put in for that time?\n\nAnd BF is an AH if he is telling you you are wrong about his nephew when that is your reality even if he doesn't see it. At a minimum he should have said that he didn't realize that and would make sure to spend more time with you. But he didn't, he went into gaslight mode (No, you're wrong, that doesn't happen).", "NTA op please run away from this guy \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA\n\n\"Oh, honey, I'm sorry I can't go with you. I waited as long as I could for you to settle on a date. I picked a week that I thought would work based on the information you gave me. I hope you have a great time with your family. Maybe we can take a nice weekend trip when we get back.\"", "I\u2019m confused here. Why would you need to take 4 weeks off for August? That\u2019s 9 months from now so you have plenty of time to figure out which week you actually need off for work?", "They\u2019re not the court system, they don\u2019t get to issue a summons and demand your presence.", "So you\u2019re suggesting it\u2019s reasonable the boyfriend demand OP keep an entire month free of ALL plans?\n\nThat\u2019s messed up.", "The drama is probably because he wants you to be with him not with your friends without him. Too bad for him he's trying to control you. Tell him to have a nice vacation you don't have to do everything together"]}
