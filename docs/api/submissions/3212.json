Even if you were married, it would be rude of them.\n\nOut of interest, do you even want to go on holiday with them?  Maybe I've been unlucky with in-laws, but the idea horrifies me.", "NTA. Shit or get off the pot, life doesn't wait and he literally knew you had a friends vacation coming up. The in laws should have been far more responsible about setting up the time-frame well in advance. don't plan anything for August? but wait on us to actually get this vacation planned? Nah, miss me with that.", "NTA. The fact that they wouldn't give you dates even knowing that you had a limited window of vacation and were planning another trip with other people and then booked without your input and are now calling you unflexible? Yikes. Don't cancel with your friends.", "NTA. Appropriately prioritizing your time for what is more important to you.", "NTA. They shouldn't have expected you to just wait around for them, and now give up your other trip with your friends.", "NTA. You tried to make it work but it sounds like they took too much time. You're 20... there will be more vacations.", "Nta!! You tried to get answers", "NTA. Time is money and they dozed! Enjoy your holiday!", "I think NTA. More info needed.\n\n1.

However, it\u2019s 9 months out, could you have gently given them a deadline?  Ie., also planning a trip with the girls, want to firm up dates, so would you be able to let me know by xyz?", "NTA.\n\nPlan a vacation and then book it. Belaboring it for weeks isn't fair, especially since they knew you were trying to plan another one.", "These aren\u2019t your in laws. They are your boyfriend\u2019s family.", "These aren\u2019t your in laws. Their your BFs parents, and they are all being weirdly demanding over a vacation.  If they want you, then they can pick a date. You don\u2019t have to put your life on hold while waiting for them to make a decision. You\u2019re 20. Tell your BF to have fun, and you\u2019ll see him when you both get back from your trips. Go have fun with your friends. \n\nAnd the way your bf acts will help you decide if you should find somebody else to plan trips with instead of him. \n\nNTA", "Super soft YTA. Asking you to block out an entire month because they can't figure it out? No. You've already told him you're going on vacation with your friends before (or at the start) of their family vacation planning.\n\nHere's TA part: You should have pre-warned him that you can't block out a whole month (if you did, then you're NTA). Might also should have said that your friend vacation was just as important to you as his families vacation is to him.", "UPD: YTA\n\nYou were invited to a holiday, with reasonably clear time ranges. You did not communicate your issues, such as having other stuff to book (eg my friends are inviting me on a trip, I need to book asap, can we book this one so I can hook the other one?).\n\nInfo: did you communicate your issues to them?", "YTA. He repeatedly asked you to keep it free for a FREE vacation, and without even discussing your concerns about the other vacation, you just booked it? And are they your in-laws or the bf\u2019s parents? And doesn\u2019t sound like you are flexible.", "Honestly, no. Hies nephew takes up ALL his attention, probably leaving me by myself. His nephew is 18 btw", "Yes, the vacation with my friends was booked three weeks ago. As no one ever directly told me anything about the vacation, all communication went through my bf. I assume that he told them, but they probably do not care as much if I am there. It just makes me wonder why there is so much drama with me not being able to come then.", "I am sorry if I did not explain it well, they booked their vacation during the vacation I had already booked. So I am not able to go with them.", "I have never thought about deadlines though, could have done that.", "Yes, correct. Only in my culture we say this as it is easier and you are often regarded as family even when not married (yet).", "Yes, I told him several times that I was not able to block out an entire month for something that would only take a week. I am sorry if I did not make this clear. He does not understand that this vacation is as important to me, because he expects me to put his family above my friends while they are not even nice to me.", "Not directly, I agree that I maybe should have, but they never directly communicated anything to me. My bf just gave me all information and nobody asked me anything. I found it hard to start to them about my demands when nobody asked me anything.", "The bf\u2019s parents. I discussed my concerns with him, just not with him family as I was never really involved in the decisions which were made.", "Cool, then don't go, stick with what you have booked.  \n\nPossibly also tell him what you just told me, he might not realise what a drag it would be for you.", "Ohhhh, never rely on the bf to communicate info. Just\u2026don\u2019t.", "And they probably did this on purpose so you aren\u2019t able to join them", "His expectation vs. yours should have been discussed. But you've already told him July is out, and August is in and that you're not blocking out a whole month.\n\nI don't see how he could expect you to drop boundaries for a 1 year relationship and family who doesn't treat you as such (yet anyway \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f).\n\nI'm adding to this:\nI've declined several \"FREE\" vacations with my own family because they either didn't plan it in a timely manner, their time frame didn't align with mine, or because they're just crappy family. \n\nTo say OP should have gone because it's free is dumb. Free trash is still trash.", "Sounds more like ESH if they were just putting it off.", "I told him before, but he tells me that it is not true.", "I will not anymore now", "I am honestly starting to feel like this, but they are saying that it is because the residence they want is only available at that time.", "This is also my pov, I feel like I am supposed to do everything his family wants me to or otherwise I am the bad guy.", "Putting what off exactly? Booking the vacation?", "So he doesn't respect your opinions and his parents don't like you (from your other response).\n\nYour holiday with friends keeps sounding better and better.", "I hate the expectation that boys are just not capable of communicating and planning and it's the girl's job. He's 24. If he didn't tell them that, he fucked up, and these are the easily foreseeable consequences that he can accept, get over it, and do better next time. Don't accept weaponized incompetence, if that's all it is.\n\nIf it is legitimately unfortunate circumstances - they really expected early August and the place really isn't available then and they dragged their feet (or weren't able for other reasons) to book, even knowing you have something else you were trying to line up... well, then, it's a shame, but they should gracefully accept you can't make it.", "Ofcourse they say that. Of they say that they prefer to go on vacation without you, they are the bad guys. Now you are! Win win for them", "I'm going to assume you've known your friends far longer than his family. I would tell him they mean the same to you as his family does to him. My best friend from high school is my kids' aunt (I'm the only girl my parents had). She is family to me, and I'd drop almost anything for her.", "Yes. Like if they COULD have booked it sooner, but just didn\u2019t want to pick, that\u2019s different than if they weren\u2019t able to bc they didn\u2019t have the availability yet.", "Well, same for me. I am happy with my decision, thank you.", "Yes, I always do the planning and make sure that I communicate everything well. He said that I should just directly communicate to his family about this, as he is not good at it. I feel like I would overstep, telling them my demands.", "Yeah, sad story. I am not that bothered by them anymore, it is just that my bf sides with them.", "I have known these friends for about five years, so yes, longer than I have known his family.", "Yes, they were putting it off. They were already busy with this months ago but could not make a decision", "I'd go with friends. Sounds like it will be a more relaxing and less judgemental atmosphere.", "You should have gone directly to them. So I will go with ESH which is better than my original YTA lol.", "Thank you, yes they are very judgemental so there was no way that I could do it right for them", "Fair enough. I think I could have, it was just hard for me as they never said anything about it directly to me. It felt weird for me to start demanding things when no one asked me to. But I will keep this in mind, thank you.", "You never said anything to them, either. If you had, maybe they would have been like oh, then we\u2019ll book first week of august. Always better to be upfront in these situations. Live and learn!", "I will, thank you!"]}
