Today I managed to get on the bus and secure a pair of empty seats while my friend was still buying his ticket. Then a random woman came to me and politely asked me if she could sit right next to me. I tried to tell her that the seat was for my friend as politely as I could, but she got visibly upset and left to get another seat.\n\nEdit: I've seen a lot of people are asking if there were other empty seats. Yes, there were plenty of other empty seats,but most of them were at the back of the bus and I sat at the front, so I guess she wanted to sit right next to me because it was the first empty seat she saw when she entered the bus.
