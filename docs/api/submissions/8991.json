And you have the right to be with your baby and she can\u2019t take it away. I am a father and have been changing diapers and giving bath to my kids from the first day they were born. It is all bs that only women can be with the babies. Except for breastfeeding you are as capable to do all the stuff as your wife. Your wife most likely needs some professional help however this should not stop you from bonding with your daughter!", "NTA. She's your child as much as hers.

If she\u2019s not herself, you need to intervene. \n\nThe perception by most is Postpartum depression/anxiety/psychosis are interchangeable and always directed towards the baby. Not true. PP depression is different from PP anxiety and is different from PP psychosis.  It\u2019s unique from person to person. My PP anxiety showed it\u2019s ugly face when daughter was 3 months. It came to a head around 6 months. Some women don\u2019t show signs for longer, and it can last for years. Anywho, I was great with our kid. But if my husband left for any given amount of time, anywhere, I was a mess.  I had unreasonable separation anxiety from him and it led to a complete breakdown and shattered my self confidence.  He recognized something was seriously wrong. He made calls to my OB immediately, found me a therapist, and gently convinced me that I wasn\u2019t myself. I absolutely needed the support. I\u2019m thankful he was able to take actions to help me.  \n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is - you need to do something. It\u2019s not going to be easy. She might refuse to recognize something is wrong. Don\u2019t feel bad for going behind her back.  Postpartum issues can be serious if left untreated. For the sake of you and your family, you need to advocate for her.

However, it\u2019s starting to affect you and your relationship, as well as the time you get to spend with your newborn. So I would suggest a very gentle conversation with her where you explain how you feel. Back it up by reassuring your wife that you\u2019ll always be there for her and your daughter. Let her know that she\u2019s not alone but make sure you drive through your points about your feelings as well. Tell her that you need to spend as much time with the baby as she does and that it would be better if your daughter gets the chance to bond with both of you. \n\nTry doing that and maybe you may get some good results. Also I would suggest getting her to see a therapist. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot she needs/wants to talk about.

Bring it up with her and if she can\u2019t see it and rejects your concerns, talk to her parents or physician because she may have PPD. Even less talked about is that some people develop PTSD from childbirth, which could also be what\u2019s happening here- you might be her trigger.

Childbirth is such a complicated thing, and it affects everyone, *including the father*.  A woman has a *lot* going on, and hormones and maternal instincts take months to normalize.  I saw it with my wife and our children, and man friends have said the same with their wives.  Weather the storm, my friend.\n\nBest thing I can advise is to try to talk to your wife when she seems open to it, preferably when the baby is napping.  If that is not possible, perhaps you can get some family involved if they are supportive.  I strongly advise not to pull anything \"I know more than you\" and just listen.\n\nYou would not be the AH, because you are the child's father and you have every right to want to be there.  You are just as capable of cuddling, changing diapers, even feeding (if it's with a bottle), and putting a baby down.  Kudos for wanting to be there.

Has she isolated herself away from you? Are you able to observe her in anyway while she is with your daughter?\n\nAt the moment you have spoken only negatively about her behaviour towards you, have you seen negative behaviour towards your daughter? Do you feel that she could harm your daughter?\n\nYes your wife needs help and so do you. You need to help her through this, it's not going to be easy by any means.\n\nContact her doctor now with your concerns, can one of her family members stay with you for a while? If a family member being their helps her then that's a positive for your daughter. \n\nAfter thinking about all of the above, if you have ANY concerns with regards to her care of your daughter and you feel she is at risk then you need help NOW!\nCall 911 and do what you need to do to ensure your daughter is safe. She is your priority as you are the only one who can keep her safe.\n\nIt would be great if you can get her help without going the emergency service route, but if you can't get her help in any other way then that's what you need to do.\n\nJust remember your wife is not intentially doing this, she doesn't have control of her thought process, her hormones are all over the place.\n\nHer priority at the moment is keeping her daughter safe from everyone, yourself included.

One thing, you say you've \"heard about husbands less than supportive to their pregnant wife.\" That can be a big problem (the stats on this are bleak). But I've heard about postpartum depression, and I'd say that's a more likely explanation here. \n\nAnd I don't want to just lash out at you; I'm coming at this from a perspective of being increasingly frustrated with what appears to be gender bias here... there was just this week a gender-reverse AITA story where a guy posted about his GF refusing to do chores, ending in a big fight. He was absolutely savaged. The story was reposed verbatim but with the genders flipped... and the \"guy\" was again ruthlessly savaged. Whichever side of the argument the guy was on, he was attacked. After the reveal, several posters were reflecting on how they read and interpreted stories.\n\nFor me, I suspect that a guy who threw his wife off the bed, vehemently blocked her form interacting with their child, was aggressive with her, cursed at her, and blamed her for life's problems, while putting on a good face to the outside world, would correctly be labeled as an abuser and treated accordingly. It strikes me as odd that flipping the genders would lead folks to wonder if *she's* being adequately supported.", "I\u2019m so sorry you were misdiagnosed.

Have a family member provide collateral history on the behavior and onset criteria. \n\nI pretty much never tell people to self diagnose, but in your case, it\u2019s more a matter of providing history: print out or copy the criteria page from the DSM-5 and make notes on each of the criteria. Go with a reliable family member for a psych evaluation and show it to the psychiatrist\u2014it takes a doctor\u2019s order to remove a diagnosis from a patient\u2019s chart. A lot of them don\u2019t want the responsibility. \n\nHallucinations are only one criteria of schizophrenia, and they are part of numerous other diagnoses.

Normally what happens is you call 911 for a 'well check'  The cops show up.

Sedated, restrained, screaming, or not, the person goes for an assessment.  The cop is necessary as the authority under which we can forcibly transport.  I've transported people having open homicidal ideation, who have been having active hallucinations, you name it. \n\nEven if we call medical control and get permission to transport without consent the cops have to be on scene to back us up. They are not there to arrest anyone but to be the authority (and are documented as such) for transport without consent. So however you slice it, there's gonna be a cop there in MOST parts of the US.
