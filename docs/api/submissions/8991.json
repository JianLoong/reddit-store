And you have the right to be with your baby and she can\u2019t take it away. I am a father and have been changing diapers and giving bath to my kids from the first day they were born. It is all bs that only women can be with the babies. Except for breastfeeding you are as capable to do all the stuff as your wife. Your wife most likely needs some professional help however this should not stop you from bonding with your daughter!", "NTA. She's your child as much as hers. Your wife doesn't get to decide if you touch the child or not.", "NTA. You need to get your wife help. If she\u2019s not herself, you need to intervene. \n\nThe perception by most is Postpartum depression/anxiety/psychosis are interchangeable and always directed towards the baby. Not true. PP depression is different from PP anxiety and is different from PP psychosis.  It\u2019s unique from person to person. My PP anxiety showed it\u2019s ugly face when daughter was 3 months. It came to a head around 6 months. Some women don\u2019t show signs for longer, and it can last for years. Anywho, I was great with our kid. But if my husband left for any given amount of time, anywhere, I was a mess.  I had unreasonable separation anxiety from him and it led to a complete breakdown and shattered my self confidence.  He recognized something was seriously wrong. He made calls to my OB immediately, found me a therapist, and gently convinced me that I wasn\u2019t myself. I absolutely needed the support. I\u2019m thankful he was able to take actions to help me.  \n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is - you need to do something. It\u2019s not going to be easy. She might refuse to recognize something is wrong. Don\u2019t feel bad for going behind her back.  Postpartum issues can be serious if left untreated. For the sake of you and your family, you need to advocate for her. Now.", "NAH - Your wife might be suffering from postpartum. As a few other have suggested, talk to your doctor and get some advice on the way forward.", "NTA. She's probably got some serious PPD and needs help ASAP. But whatever you do, don't let her use it as an excuse to be nasty or cruel to you.

However, it\u2019s starting to affect you and your relationship, as well as the time you get to spend with your newborn. So I would suggest a very gentle conversation with her where you explain how you feel. Back it up by reassuring your wife that you\u2019ll always be there for her and your daughter. Let her know that she\u2019s not alone but make sure you drive through your points about your feelings as well. Tell her that you need to spend as much time with the baby as she does and that it would be better if your daughter gets the chance to bond with both of you. \n\nTry doing that and maybe you may get some good results. Also I would suggest getting her to see a therapist. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot she needs/wants to talk about.

Are you so perfectly in tune with her body that you know when to push the breathing exercises?\n\nHe didn't want his wife to hyperventilate, plus he was driving.

You babysat. You changed a diaper.\r  \n\r  \nYou didn't breastfeed. You didn't give birth. You weren't a real parent, you weren't awake every hour, you didn't care for the new mother, you didn't lose sleep.\r  \n\r  \nAll you did was assume your babysitting experience made you so much more knowledgeable than your wife who actually did all the work to get baby into this world alive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe didn't babysit, he helped raise his younger siblings by helping take care of them for years. In this take you draw some conclusions you have no idea of knowing, like wether he was up all night or not, he may have been, and he may have lost sleep. He didn't breastfeed, but he did feed them. He does know more about child care than she does because of this. Giving birth doesn't make you an expert in child care, otherwise courses for expecting parents wouldn't exist. You're being very disrespectful and frankly insulting towards OP.", "He does have more experience with kids than she does. As a woman who is currently pregnant, giving birth does not mean you are all of a sudden more knowledgeable and experienced with taking care of children.

It is not a punishment. They are explicitly not being punished because they were not responsible due to their mental illness.", "I agree with this.\n\nGiving birth is hard, but it doesn't automatically make you a master at child care.

For a while it meant that I couldn\u2019t even be in the same room as a garbage disposal, even though logically, I would never want to do that. I wish my husband would have listened to me and supported me instead of dismissing my fears, because it made it much harder for me to get better alone. Looking back, I know these fears were irrational, but I really needed to be heard in order for me to process them and move on. \n\nThese feelings seem out of your control when it\u2019s happening, they seem logical, and you can\u2019t see yourself as others do.

It's true your wife could have PPD and it could also have started as prenatal depression/ anxiety, which is talked about less often but is definitely a thing too. However, it sounds like something else was happening around the time of birth in your relationship. The behaviour started before not after.  So what was happening leading up to it? Why was she mad even before?  And why has it been a whole month and you haven't said anything yet? I don't get it. What are we missing here.", "YTA for the comment \"I know A LOT more than she does\". I really hope you didn't say that to her, I'd have been pissed off even if it was true.\n\nBut aside from that, your wife seems to be struggling a lot, and at the very least this needs a visit to a doctor to check for PPD, possibly ongoing therapist sessions (even couples therapy if this doesn't improve).
