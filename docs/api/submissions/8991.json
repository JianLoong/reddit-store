This behavior is only directed towards me, she's still nice with all her relatives and they're able to play with the baby for as long as they want but I can't even touch her at times.

It\u2019s not at all an issue to talk to your wife and call the obgyn and explain what\u2019s going on to get a better idea of what\u2019s the next best step to take.", "PPD can manifest as rage and anger. It\u2019s not just want people think of when they hear \u201cdepression\u201d. I would contact the OB. Your wife needs help/ intervention before it becomes more serious.\n\nEdit: NTA", "Nta.  This is not normal behavior.  She may need some help.", "NTA and it all depends on delivery. It\u2019s very concerning behaviour and likely PPD or PPP related and she may need clinical help. It\u2019s going to be a hard conversation and if you push too hard she could break and it would not be good. \n\nDoes she have an OB appointment coming up? Might be a good time to bring it up with her and have her talk to her OB.", " NTA. Your wife needs help ASAP. This is PPD/PPP. \n\nMake sure you bring this up at her next OB appointment.", "NTA i actually am the youngest of five women all of whom have children and I also have friends and I don\u2019t know anyone who has reacted this way. You need to address it. Unfortunately, it sounds like she won\u2019t be very receptive, but honestly this is not ok, this is important bonding time for you too.", "NTA - sounds like your wife needs psychological help.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s your kid. Of course you have as much right and access to your kid as she does. She doesn\u2019t get to dictate that and you don\u2019t need to ask for permission. It\u2019s your child too, just as much as hers. \n\nSo start bonding with your baby and get someone to investigate your wife for post partum so she can get treated.", "NTA but perhaps she's going through PPD. You should definitely address the issue as son as possible.", "NTA\n\nGet some one to watch your daughter and talk to her about her behaviour,  also get her into therapy because this attitude can cause a lot of issues in the long term.", "NTA. And you have the right to be with your baby and she can\u2019t take it away. I am a father and have been changing diapers and giving bath to my kids from the first day they were born. It is all bs that only women can be with the babies. Except for breastfeeding you are as capable to do all the stuff as your wife. Your wife most likely needs some professional help however this should not stop you from bonding with your daughter!", "NTA. She's your child as much as hers. Your wife doesn't get to decide if you touch the child or not.", "NTA. You need to get your wife help. If she\u2019s not herself, you need to intervene. \n\nThe perception by most is Postpartum depression/anxiety/psychosis are interchangeable and always directed towards the baby. Not true. PP depression is different from PP anxiety and is different from PP psychosis.  It\u2019s unique from person to person. My PP anxiety showed it\u2019s ugly face when daughter was 3 months. It came to a head around 6 months. Some women don\u2019t show signs for longer, and it can last for years. Anywho, I was great with our kid. But if my husband left for any given amount of time, anywhere, I was a mess.  I had unreasonable separation anxiety from him and it led to a complete breakdown and shattered my self confidence.  He recognized something was seriously wrong. He made calls to my OB immediately, found me a therapist, and gently convinced me that I wasn\u2019t myself. I absolutely needed the support. I\u2019m thankful he was able to take actions to help me.  \n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is - you need to do something. It\u2019s not going to be easy. She might refuse to recognize something is wrong. Don\u2019t feel bad for going behind her back.  Postpartum issues can be serious if left untreated. For the sake of you and your family, you need to advocate for her. Now.", "NAH - Your wife might be suffering from postpartum. As a few other have suggested, talk to your doctor and get some advice on the way forward.", "NTA. She's probably got some serious PPD and needs help ASAP. But whatever you do, don't let her use it as an excuse to be nasty or cruel to you. Because no amount of hormonal changes or pain is a free pass to treat others like crap.", "NTA but you need to get her to a doctor and report ALL of this to the doctor IMMEDIATELY. She's not okay. This is not okay.", "INFO: \n\n>although she has no prior experience with babies and I know ALOT more then she does.\n\nPlease explain this.", "Info, how did you act during the birth?", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA but it also won't do any good.", "Info: why are you specifically saying you know a lot more than her?", "Your wife reminds me of those female dog videos where the male dog tries to play with the new pups.", "I\u2019m curious why you think you know \u201calot\u201d more about babies and how you\u2019ve expressed this to her", "NTA. she could be dealing with ppd, she should talk to someone. i have also heard of this happening to women who breastfeed, but once they switched to formula due to the mental toll the behavior stopped. could this also be a possibility? either way, she needs to talk to someone and see what steps she can take, because while you are feeling terrible right now, she is likely miserable", "NAH\n\nPostpartum can be absolute hell to go through and I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like for wife. However, it\u2019s starting to affect you and your relationship, as well as the time you get to spend with your newborn. So I would suggest a very gentle conversation with her where you explain how you feel. Back it up by reassuring your wife that you\u2019ll always be there for her and your daughter. Let her know that she\u2019s not alone but make sure you drive through your points about your feelings as well. Tell her that you need to spend as much time with the baby as she does and that it would be better if your daughter gets the chance to bond with both of you. \n\nTry doing that and maybe you may get some good results. Also I would suggest getting her to see a therapist. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot she needs/wants to talk about. It\u2019s better to let it all out than hold it in.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
