She flatly told me not to eat anything from HER pantry.\n\n(my wife, who does not suffer fools, often folds when it comes to her mom, because she doesn't want to disturb the peace.

Dinner was fine - she was kinda cool to me, but I figured she was just working through her feelings, because we all have feelings.\n\nBut she told my wife today that she's still \"hurt\" by what I did.

Sorry but for me it\u2019is childish and disrespectful. I guess it\u2019s really about culture.", "I was scrolling through the comments trying to find my people \ud83d\ude02\n\nI have ME and have to eat at fairly regular times or I get really hangry and start losing brain function. We literally have to plan food stops into meet-ups with other people and make it clear that food will have to happen at specific times or I'll start slurring and lose focus. \n\nMy sister on the other hand just gets really ratty about half an hour after she's said she's starting to get hungry, so if we're out with her, we drop everything and head for food lol", "Hell nahhh.\nIf I\u2019m hungry I\u2019m not gonna wait over 3 hours to eat when I could eat now. 3 hours is easily enough time to be hungry again.\nNTA but the MIL is especially since she\u2019s still talking about it", "It\u2019s absolutely insane to tell a grown adult when to eat. \u201cDon\u2019t ruin your dinner\u201d is for 8 year olds who don\u2019t know how to self regulate yet and will subsist on a diet of Doritos and ice cream if not accompanied.", "That's how you \"apologize\" to someone you never want to speak to you again, fyi.\n\nIf you plan to try to have a healthyrelationship with your mother in laws this passive aggressive bullshit is a great way guarantee it NEVER happens.", "My grandma swears she doesn't get the hungry feeling. \nThey eat lunch at 12 on the dot, dinner at 6PM. \n\nShe finds it weird that I don't eat breakfast when I get up at 10 ... but she would never stop me from eating snacks inbetween, just reminds me about the next meal.  \nBut that comes from them being born between 1940 and 1947, they don't want to waste cooked food because I gorged on snacks"]}
