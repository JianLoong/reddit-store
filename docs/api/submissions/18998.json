She flatly told me not to eat anything from HER pantry.\n\n(my wife, who does not suffer fools, often folds when it comes to her mom, because she doesn't want to disturb the peace.

Dinner was fine - she was kinda cool to me, but I figured she was just working through her feelings, because we all have feelings.\n\nBut she told my wife today that she's still \"hurt\" by what I did.

You know your body better than MIL and if you're hungry at 2:30 then you shouldn't have to starve until dinner at 6pm. Her forbidding you access to the food in her house until the dinner she was making is extremely controlling. Being cool during dinner because you went over her head and got your own snacks is childish and also controlling. \n\nI don't think you should apologize just to \"smooth things over\" because MIL is the one that made them rocky to begin with.

When we explained that this is not suitable/enough for two small children and that they need regular meals, and btw ice cream does not count as a meal, the sulks of my mother!  When my husband lost his temper and just went into her kitchen to make our hungry children a hot meal, she acted as if he had slapped her.  We had to resort to pretending to go out visiting friends so we could go for a meal and not be starving.

And then you ate her freaking dinner to boot, with no complaints. \n\nWhile I understand that your wife wants to smooth things over, I personally don\u2019t think you should let this go. I almost guarantee it\u2019ll occur again, and if you don\u2019t \u2018comply\u2019 (which I suspect you won\u2019t), your previous apology will be hollow, and your MIL might be even more offended. Moreover, your MIL cannot claim to be \u2018hurt\u2019 every time you don\u2019t follow her orders to the letter, especially when they are at your own detriment.

Three hours before dinner he'd always have something to say if he heard the fridge door open.
