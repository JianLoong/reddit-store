This happened many weeks ago, and only today did I find out she is carrying a little bit of a grudge. I am 33m, my wife is 32f, MIL is 68f.\n\nOkay, a bit of background: my MIL is not some horrible hellion from whatever weird place they spawn terrible mothers in law. She's generally kind to me. We come from different cultural backgrounds - I am from a liberal coastal city, she is from The Heartland - but it's fine, usually. \n\nThe context for this story is that she, by her own admission, wanted to be The Matriarch at this point in her life. She wanted her two kids to have grandkids and live down the street and she wanted to be the undisputed head of an extended family. Instead, her two kids are child-free, her husband divorced her, and she raised a headstrong daughter who married a guy (me) who's not particularly good at taking orders. I promise I'm not a jerk. \n\nWe went to visit in late March for a long weekend. Everything was a Normal Day. I woke up, ate lunch, and she was making us a surprise dinner that she promised I'd like, which should be done around 6:00.  Everything okay thus far.\nAt 2:30(ish?) I realized I didn't eat enough lunch, and I have always had full access to her pantry, so I went to find something to tide me over. And that's when it started: she \"didn't want me to ruin my dinner.\" \n\nI know my body and I know I'd be grumpy waiting 3h30m for dinner, so I promised I wouldn't ruin my dinner. And she kept on me, she said \"no, I'm serious, you're gonna like it\". I agreed that I would like it, told her that I was hungry **now**, and kept walking. She told me that I was ruining dinner. I said I was really hungry. She flatly told me not to eat anything from HER pantry.\n\n(my wife, who does not suffer fools, often folds when it comes to her mom, because she doesn't want to disturb the peace. I don't blame her for not intervening on my behalf.)\n\nFinally I just told her \"fine\" and I walked a mile to the gas station to get some snacks. Dinner was fine - she was kinda cool to me, but I figured she was just working through her feelings, because we all have feelings.\n\nBut she told my wife today that she's still \"hurt\" by what I did. My wife, to her credit, didn't ASK me to apologize to my MIL, but did say it would help soothe feelings. But I don't think I did anything wrong.
