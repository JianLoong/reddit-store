Because I don't want this to happen everytime something like this is happening.\n\nLast night I went to make my son a bottle and we had very little water pressure. I told my husband and he brushed it off. We live next to my parents so I got ahold of my mom to see if they were experiencing the same and their water was fine. Looked things up and it gave a list of possible problems, but Said that if the pressure is low something is wrong basically. Told my husband this and he still brushed things off. I needed to give the baby a bath so I told him I was going to my parents to do so. He told me to do what I want. When I walked outside I could hear the water rushing. Our dog had ripped the spicket for the hose off and it was just pouring water out. I told my husband and he went outside. I told him there's a valve under there to turn the hose on/off and he looked for a bit but couldn't find it. I shut off the main water to the house but it kept flowing. The hoses were an addition so I believe they connect before the shut off valve. My neighbor/cousin had turned them on for me when I first moved in so I knew there was a valve under there but wasn't sure where. I'm pregnant and the house is low so I couldn't help by going under to look. My husband went inside and opened up the utility closet to look for something else to shut the water off. He wouldn't believe me that there was a valve. He wouldn't let me have my neighbor come over to shut off the valve from outside. He messed with things for at least 30 mins. Kept shutting me down when I'd try to offer help and just kept saying he didn't want anyone here. Well I said screw it and just went up to my mom's to give the baby a bath and said he can figure it out. He was inside on his phone at this point. I assume looking up what to do but I don't know. My dad said he was going to change and go down there to find it. He had the valve turned off in minutes and water pressure was back to normal in the rest of the house. When I came home my husband refused to talk to me about things. He laid in bed all night and then went to the couch to sleep when i laid down. He said that I disrespected him and just did whatever I wanted regardless of how he felt. He didn't want anyone at the house, but my dad didn't even come inside. In my opinion, I fixed the problem that he didn't want to deal with from the beginning.

I\u2019d be mad at him. He\u2019s got his head up his ass and can\u2019t be there for you when you really need him to be. And then his ego gets in the way of actual progress. I mean I just reread your post and he said that you disrespected him and did whatever you wanted regardless of how he felt? Dear Lord girl, she did that to you!! do not let this misogynistic bullshit run your life. And I\u2019m sorry if he is to incapable of fixing some thing, he needs to be able to fucking admit that.

It turned out there were a few things going on some might give you some flags to talk to your partner about. \n\nHe ended up having depression (similar to mums) that was caused by the pregnancy and preparing  for it. He felt I didn't need him and his mood sunk lower he'd just want to lay down on his phone. It was really frustrating but after we focalised it he ended up deciding to get some help (it took him around 2 weeks to decide that) and we are back to a healthy place now.\n\nMy dad is also super helpful and like mums don't get on as easily with mils, it happens for the dads as well!. While I understand the emergency nature, I think it was just the wrong person and the not wanting your help is totally because he is embarrassed that he doesn't have this knowledge. Maybe your dad could offer to show him where everything is for next time? If his dad wasn't one for showing how to fix things he might appreciate the time given to improve (although I doubt he'll ask your dad himself). \n\nWhen you do talk about this watch out for him dodging your feelings! It's important you talk about it. I found that been quite blunt that \nYes my dad fixed this and it hurt you. I acknowledge/understand  these feelings.

Jeez. Isn't it always the ones so protective of their manhood that make the biggest deal about their feelings hurt. \n\nIn the nicest way, your husband needs to get over himself. In an emergency, it's all-hand-on-deck. Does he think you LIKED having to call everyone in the neighborhood? That you LIKED addressing the issue at hand multiple times only to be taken even semi-seriously once it was so abundantly clear it was an emergency he might as well been knocked over the head by the situation? Does he think you LIKED worrying, searching, and solving for a potential problem for an hour before he deigned to get involved?? \n\n\"Sweetheart, I busted my butt last night, pregnant and caring for a child I might add, to diagnose and address the water for an hour before you would even give me the time of day. Once you finally deigned to help, you boxed me out entirely, dismissing every one of my suggestions and directions when it's EXACTLY those suggestions and directions that solved the damn issue. I knew there was a problem, did the work to find it, remembered the solution, and engaged help to get it fixed. If you're feeling sensitive about this, I would encourage you to consider if that feeling is stemming from how absolutely rude, dismissive, and unhelpful you were in an emergency. If that's the case, **I** am not the one that made you feel that way. You made all of your behavior choices on your own, like an adult. Maybe you should accept responsibility for them and the emotions they lead to like an adult too.\"", " Major ego issues.
