Yes, we got married very young & now have two amazing kiddos Layla F8 & Mika M6. When we got pregnant with Layla he basically told me that he didn\u2019t want me to \u2018stress\u2019 with school & work and wanted me to be a SAHM & he would take care of everything financially. Although I wanted to make my own money & have a degree to fall back on, he reassured me that I wouldn\u2019t need it because he would be my \u2018provider & protector.\u2019   Eli comes from a very traditional family and believed gender roles were necessary for a successful relationship/ home.\n\nAfter high school, he started working for his father which made \u2018providing\u2019 easy for him at such a young age.  \n\nOur relationship has been amazing. We both did our parts to make sure our home was running smoothly, I have been a SAHM & wife taking care of everyone & everything and he has kept his promise from 21 and always made sure money wasn\u2019t an issue.  \n\nNow that my kids are a little older, I have more time to focus on doing things I love. About 2 years ago I started creating content and for a while it was just a hobby.  Last year my platform kinda blew up & I started working with a lot of brands who paid me very well. I also started to diversify my income by building my own brand which is doing well thanks to my following. That + Ad Rev + Brand deals allowed me to make about the same as my husband. \n\nAs time has gone by, things keep getting better for me. This past year, I made a little more than he did. I am very open with him & told him how much I make. I thought he\u2019d be happy for me, and for a while he was. Recently he has been acting differently and the other day he told me It was about time I contribute financially. \n\nI told according to gender roles, it is not my job to provide & protect and that I was perfectly fine cooking, cleaning & raising the kids full time. It\u2019s not my fault my \u2018hobby\u2019 makes more than his full time job.  I also said if he wanted me to help out he needed to humble himself & start doing some of the work I do at home. \n\nHe is pretty upset & our friends think I should be helping out since I am making more.\n\nEdit:  For everyone asking, I\u2019m not being selfish & keeping the money just for myself. Thanks to my income We now have an emergency fund, college fund for both our kids, & they now go to private school & tutors.  My kids also get to have life experience they otherwise wouldn\u2019t. There are plenty of other things I do to contribute financially just not willing to go 50/50 if he doesn\u2019t even want to watch the kids on his days off.", "created_utc": 1673386085, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108ljli/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_husband_with_the/", "score": 2032, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I also take the older kids to school four days a week as my job allows that to happen. Even if you didn't have money coming in, he should be helping around the house as the stay at home parent has a much tougher job! You are not the AH!

You can always renegotiate where you both contribute equally, but then he needs to step up & start doing half the household chores & childcare.", "NTA. You both work, & *you* take care of all the household needs.

If he\u2019s splitting childcare and chores 50/50, than I can understand him wanting to split bills too.\n\nBut if you\u2019re still technically a sahm and still expected to do everything in the house and all the childcare, keep that money for yourself until he learns to split the chores and childcare.\n\nHe wanted strict gender roles, when it suited him. \n\nNow, he wants the best of a traditional and modern woman, while he doesn\u2019t want to give the same to the relationship and wants to do nothing to help and only wants pay half the bills?\n\nWhen he\u2019s willing to be a modern man that splits everything then you can be a modern woman that splits everything.\n\nAnd I\u2019m a modern woman that splits everything with my modern partner.

So where's all the money going?", "NTA, he wants you to contribute but he doesn't want to contribute to the house chores.  It doesn't work that way.

And more money than him, no less. So, he's actually changing the rules based on an unforeseen factor.\n\nAsking that you contribute financially while still doing all of the household chores is imbalanced. If he wants to renegotiate your original agreement, then it's fair for you to ask to renegotiate both sides.\n\nI would imagine he may be feeling some kind of insecurity, or embarrassment, or even a loss of control. He may have some ingrained needs connected to being the provider.\n\nIt may be helpful to explore how to renegotiate your agreements while also addressing those needs and also addressing your need for fairness.", "INFO: If Eli has been taking care of the household expenses using his own income, what do you do with your income?

I completely understand why your instinct is to say what you said. Sounds like he reaped what he sowed. He wanted to be the provider and he made that very clear. He's also obviously upset and jealous that you are now making more money. And, you're right, if you had clearly defined roles, it's very reasonable for you to expect that if you contribute financially, he also contributes to household work.\n\nBut also, at the end of the day, this is your family you are talking about, so you definitely have to do some better communication to try to get to an agreement here. Both of you might need to have a big slice of humble pie here.", "NTA because he\u2019s asking for an equal financial responsibility split but not an equal household work split.\n\nThat said, I think you both should look at your respective accounts. Yes, you\u2019re making more now but do you have any retirement accounts in your own name? How are your social security benefits looking? There might be some catch up asset creation that it would make sense for you to build. If you were going to spend your new earnings on a lifestyle upgrade for yourself, I\u2019d say YTA but you can and should use this to balance out the respective assets you both have and maybe you both can retire earlier than you could have on his income alone.", "NTA - If he wants your money he gets to help out around the house.

Did agree to do so? Did he refuse to do anything before?", "If both of you are earning well, hire a cleaning crew to clean the house every week and someone to meal prep for the week.

Sorry, not sorry.  NTA.  Hubby wants money, but doesn't want to do his fair share of the household and child-rearing chores.  Who'd a thunk?", "I know there's lots of ways of being married, but man- so many of the posts on this sub make me think that husband and wives are in some competition to \"win\" against each other their entire lives, instead of partners who love each other and trying to help each other out and be a family together. \n\nI mean, I guess if I have to give a judgement, I'd say NTA, but this doesn't seem like any way to be in a marriage.", "Since you are also making money now, yes it is fair to share bills, but also housework and childcare! The only reason I am going to say NTA, is because he is not doing these", "NTA. If he doesn't help at home then not a problem keeping your $", "I was all set to say YTA, but right at the end I saw the real problem.\nIF your husband is ready to be equal partners in household chores and contribute to \"your duties\" then welcome to the 21st century you can start also contributing to \"his duties\".\n\nIf he is not willing to contribute more than you agreed to initially then why should you?\n\nSo not sure who TA is.

You should help eachother out. You should help with the bills and he should help out at home.", "ESH. You both need to reevaluate gender roles, work division and financial responsibility.

You mention 50/50 but marriage is not 50/50 it's 100/100 and I hope you figure that out before I did well into my second marriage.

You're not doing extra work on top of raising the kids and tending the house, you just have a smaller workload than you did when your agreement started and supplemented that with an activity that brought in income.\n\nThus, you absolutely should contribute to the finances and YTA for not contributing at all.\n\nRegarding the split, that's another matter. If he's expecting an equitable split of finances (ie you contribute the share of your income that you bring in toward shared expenses), this is only fair if he's willing to split the household chores in an equitable way.\n\nIf he's asking you to pay a reasonable amount, then you're absolutely TA.\n\nIMO, the split should be a fraction of how much working time you spend on the house vs your work(assuming an equal hours of labor burden)\n\nFor a simplified example, if you work 4 hours and do 4 hours of household chores and you make $600 at your job while he makes $400 at his, then your equitable share should be half of your income ($300) to his whole income ($400), so 3/7 of the household expenses. \n\nHowever, if your husband is willing to do half of the household chores, then you should have an equatable split where you are responsible for 60% (600/1000) of the expenses. \n\nEither way, it's totally unfair and very selfish to say \"what's yours is mine and what's mine is also mine\".", "Yta, the arrangement you had where he was looking after everything financially was when you had no money.

He might be a little threatened by your success, and that's a really destructive instinct. Nothing makes people behave worse than embarrassment, and nothing is harder to own up to.

And that will be extremely frustrating for you because you, rightly, think you deserve to be proud of your accomplishments. And I'm sure you wish your partner would acknowledge your success and be proud of you instead of threatened.\n\nBut if you can identify and articulate the source of conflict, you may be able to fix it--assuming you want to. Here, the conflict is caused by him feeling embarrassed that his source of value to the family is being undermined (at least form his perspective). So try to communicate to him that he's valuable beyond his paycheck without explicitly spelling it out in a way that makes him feel like you see his embarrassment. No one wants to be seen as embarrassed and that will only backfire. But keep emphasizing that he's a good father, partner, etc. He helped put you in a position where you could pursue your own endeavors. Your success is his success and vice versa. Whatever you really think about these points, if you want to maintain the relationship you'll need to gently allow him to develop a new identity for his self-esteem.\n\nI also wouldn't entirely shut out the idea of contributing to expenses--even doing so without changing up the other family dynamics. Not that you actually should give into this unless you're really comfortable with it, but it can be used as a point of gentle leverage to get you into counseling, which you really need. A professional will be much better at helping him adapt his identity in a way that doesn't blow things up.\n\nI might consider saying something like: I'm not saying no to your requests, and I recognize that I owe a lot of my success to you because I wouldn't have been able to pursue this without the support you gave me, etc. But, it's a new thing and a new dynamic, and it would help me process this if we could have an outside party who has seen relationships go through these kinds of changes before. There's no need to do this blind, we can take advantage of other people's experience.\n\nThe fact is, he's acting inappropriately and the things you're asking for are reasonable. But there's a way to help him see that without further embarrassing him, which is only likely to be counterproductive.

SAHP isn't a job where you punch a clock\n\nI've literally never implied that I thought this. Almost every comment Ive made I've said that the husband is adult garbage, or some equivalent. Obviously a SAHP is a hard job. I've also never said it wasn't. But certain liberties allow themselves to you when you are one. Like the fact that you typically have a little bit more free time than single parents who have a 9-5. Not much more, it fluctuates based on ages of children hard.\n\n>Presumably, she could have started her business while working a 9-5 job, if she didn't marry him & raise kids.\n\nYeah. She also could have just as likely been too stressed working a more traditional career. So these assumptions are meaningless. In another way of saying it, a SAHP is entitled to none of their partners money because they could have just done it without the partner. Or do you not believe that to be the case?\n\n>You wouldn't even dream of claiming that employer is \"entitled\" to a share of her new income. I hope.\n\nBut OP's husband isn't her employer.

Now he\u2019s seeing you earn as much and have that power too, more so since it\u2019s all going to you, and he isn\u2019t entirely happy and wants to assert some control over it. It isn\u2019t enough you\u2019re paying for emergency funds and stuff, he needs to insist on even more of it.\n\nYou are right. If he wants an egalitarian relationship where you provide too and he gets more fun money, he needs to start doing his fair share around the house. He can hire cleaners and stuff as part of his with that new increased disposable income he has. He cannot have it both ways. He cannot insist you have to do all the housework because men provide, and then expect you to provide too.\n\nIn fact, you damn well *are* providing by paying for tutors, emergency fund etc. if he\u2019s providing nothing on the home front you shouldn\u2019t be doing that!

He wants to control you; making you not go to school or work, etc is all financial abuse and now you\u2019ve broken out and of course he\u2019s unhappy about it. \n\nPlease honestly consider what you\u2019re teaching your kids here and if he genuinely thinks of you as an equal partner, and then think about whether you want to continue in this relationship as it is.", "Nta but you already are contributing to the family (and let's put aside that being a sahp is a financial contribution) you are just paying for specific items. I don't love the division of your relationship but if you want to be in this relationship then I think the 2 of you need to sit down and discuss finances and chores (maybe you even need to do this in therapy if things are so contentions and his misogyny is so deep-seated) if you put all expenses together including the ones you are paying for he might see that you are already contributing your (income ratio 60/40, 50/50) share or at least a lot closer than he realised. I agree with other comments about maybe outsourcing some housework. Husband definitely needs to step up and do more around the house/with the kids either way. Maybe, after you looked at an overall family budget, husband could decrease his work hours (with an agreement that x amount of hours applied to housework/childcare) then both of them could pick up additional hobbies (maybe a joint one too). And Bala ce the load a different way.\n\nI think op does herself (and her children) a disservice by referring to her income as a hobby (i know why she is doing it) she built a succesful profitable company. And she did it without a college degree or career experience, all whilst raising her kids. He should be proud of her. All relationships need checking and to evolve as things change. It seems neither of them have  even willing to do that, in part because husband doesn't want anything to change and doesn't want to put in any work himself. It's time for both of them to have so e difficult converstaio s.\n\nHonestly, I think the issue is deeper though. He doesnt like that his wife has money. Probably doesnt like that op earns the same as him for only a few hours work whikst he has to do 40hr weeks. Doesn't like that he doesn't control all finances (and seemjngly all decisions). Is misogynistic etc\n\nIf op wants the relationship to continue they need therapy but I don't see what she is getting out of the relationship. She can financially provide for herself (and the kids), she already does all the house work and child care, their personal relasionship is run by what he wants (a sahw, no college or career for her etc)  so what is he brining to the table for her?\n\nI wonder what things ops husband holds himself and the family back from by attempting to live in the deluded reality of gender roles.

I told him he can't have it both ways. You want me to be submissive and traditional and be the helpless woman while I am paying the bills. Since I am working and paying bills, how about you help with the household work I have to do when I clean up after your lazy ass.

When are her days off?", "*akshually* you cannot both have a cake and eat it, once it is eaten there is no cake", "Okay so that info is in the edit that she posted after my comment", "Yeah but that still begs the question of I have a stay at home wife and that is a part of our budget so that feels like then she is paying for the budget but apparently the husband needs help on the expenses.  I get the feeling he may be working 60 hours a week killing himself and needs a lifeline.  Feels like they need to manage a budget and the household work together and come with a new arrangement.  The whole article was you made your bed and you lie in it up until we got to the edit when it was he won\u2019t negotiate with me.  The tune changed quite a bit.", "Ok thats too fckin cute \ud83e\udd18\ud83d\ude01", "This. You already contribute financially. If you were to start contributing what would he plan on doing with his extra money? Would he be spending it on the kids and groceries? If so then the end result is the same. If not (which I suspect is the case here) he would be using it for himself to the detriment of your family.", "I would be careful. I was married to a guy like this. I was a sahm to 2 kids. When they got in school I contributed to household bills while also still doing all household work. When we divorced I had very little social security. And he had quietly been setting up retirement funds in his name only. Just pls be careful. I trusted him  \ud83d\udcaf. Big mistake", "The word you're looking for is sexist or mysognist not traditional.", "You don\u2019t blame him for how he was raised\u2026 but are you comfortable raising your children the same way?

This is info to discuss with a tax pro. Do not what so ever continue to mingle business and personal finances. If this spouse on paper starts rearing his ugly side of his a-hole, he can decimate your holdings of the business. And henceforth, do not ever tell him your income again. This is unacceptable and the relationship is entirely out of balance.", "Your husband is a misogynist. He doesn't want to cook and clean because they're 'feminine', and feminine is a step down for him, because in his eyes being a woman is worse than being a man.\n\nYou earning money though, that's good because he sees it as a step UP to male traits, which he views as better than female.\n\nYou have a daughter. Is this the message you want her to absorb?", "So now the issue becomes what are you willing to put up with? I know you say he is amazing husband/father but he is traditional and refuses to help around the home, now that was fine in the beginning because you had an agreement.\n\n..But he is upset now because he has lost the financial control over you, you see you're making good money, so now you have options.  I'm not trying to say he is awful, because you have told us he is great apart from he lack of helping with the kids and any housework...etc..\n\n..but you can't start contributing financially now and have him still not lift a finger around the house, you have to be clear with that and not cave to him, because honestly he isn't going to help and it will be like getting blood from a stone trying to get him to start contributing to the children and house after 10 years of no having to do any of that, so the easiest thing in my eyes is not go 50/50, I mean geez you still pay and contribute to things.\n\nWhat is he going to do if you say no I'm not going 50/50? He doesn't have financial control so you are on the front foot with that. Just don't cave to this!", "Cool, so it's her full time job, and he has a full time job and they split the household duties.\nIf he won't agree to that he's TA.", "I'm not disagreeing, I'm just confused by her phrasing and asked for clarification.", "OP states in her comments and edit that she set up an emergency fund for them, college fund for both kids, pay for their private school tuition and tutors, buys groceries, items children need and pay for all vacations and experiences.

It's in my tummy", "I appreciate you. Finally, an explanation I can comprehend. Thank you<3", "My understanding -- and I may be misremembering tbh -- is that having a cake is an old-timey thing, where having a cake for a decoration/to show off you have the means for a cake was a thing. Which I still find a little boggling in a modern context, but it makes some sense to me that at some point, there was a reason to have a cake and not yet have eaten it.", "Yeah which is really bizarre. Without the edit I could understand the husband being annoyed. It initially sounded like the wife was hoarding all her own income and not helping out at all financially. \n\nBut she is totally helping out based on the added information. I cannot underhand how she didn\u2019t see that info as relevant from the get go.", "I did the laundry and cooked today and a grew tits.  Then I jacked off to myself in the mirror and watched a football game and they disappeared.

This is how this toxic shit stays generation after generation even though we keep thinking it will die out.", "Bingo", "I'm surprised I had to read so far to find this statement. OP has emasculated their husband. This relationship may get very rocky before it gets better. Husband has some growing to do. NTA.", "Thank you! She deserves a lot of judgment for how she\u2019s enabled this toxic misogyny ESPECIALLY in front of impressionable kids.", "I remember being so pissed at my step dad when he said that to me as a teen. I was like that doesn\u2019t make sense, it felt so silly. I just remember ranting on in my head, because I was too scared to say anything to him. \n\n\u2018Why wouldn\u2019t I want to eat cake if I had it. If I didn\u2019t eat it, it\u2019d go bad and there\u2019s no point to having it, etc.\u2019", "I think because the actual heart of the matter is that he wanted their life arranged so that he provided money and has easily done so, he held up his end of what he wanted. So has she. His income still provides for the lifestyle they have had for ten years. Now her extra brings extra to their lifestyle. The providing is still his, as the house work is still hers. I can't see what he should be annoyed about other than his own choices? Eta: like even before her edit, he still shouldn't expect money from her unless he is picking up housework and childcare.", "Can confirm. She's lucky doing housework let her have a boy at all! My mom did housework while she was pregnant with me and lo and behold, I was born without a penis. Fell off before I was even done cooking!", "Legit. Insignificant. Taking out the trash takes 30 seconds, if that is considered a chore and not just some random thing you do when the bin is full, that's where the problem lies. This is like saying switching the toilet paper over when the roll is empty is a chore. \n\nHer husband probably looks at a full bin and waits for his wife to take it out because it's \"houswork\".", "My mum got on a tipsy ramble about it one year when I was in my late teens, very much along the same lines -  \n*\"if you're going to go to the effort of baking a cake, why wouldn't you eat it? Why would you go out and buy one just to look at? Do you think you can buy plastic decorative cakes like those fruits Nanna used to have in a bowl?\"*\n\nWe looked up the etymology and she decided she still didn't like it and that it's a \"stupid\" saying because cake is for eating", "Right? Like what the hell else am I gonna do with this cake that I have? Encase in it resin?", "Has he really easily done so?\n\nSounds like without her new income they wouldn\u2019t have an emergency fund, wouldn\u2019t have college savings for the kids, etc.\n\nMy guess is that the guy was just getting by before. Perhaps even struggling to do so. And the bills eat up a lot of his earnings, and that\u2019s part of why he wants her to help pay the bills.\n\nWith that said. He absolutely should help with housework if she is going to begin to help pay for the bills too. To be honest the guy is a jackass who should be helping some with those things anyways. My mom was a SAHM. My dad worked long hours but still contributing by helping with cooking and household chores."]}
