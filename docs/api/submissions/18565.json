You can\u2019t thaw food for hours then safely refreeze it.", "I would be a wee bit cautious, just because it was a buffet. So\u2026sitting out all night, being out in the car, driven to the house, and frozen that night? The next night? Then defrosted and left to sit out in a buffet for the whole wedding.", "Yep, my parents always bought a side of beef at a time when I was a kid and kept it in the giant chest freezer.\n\n(That's probably why I ended up vegetarian\ud83d\ude0a)", "That was my thought even irrespective of any risks. \n\nThe food was meant for people in need.  \n\nNot people who are just cheap.", "I mean, if it was an amount that mom herself would eat and she only served it to people that knew the provenance of the food, I feel like that's a reasonable use of the food.", "OP notes in a comment that her mother has had problems with food safety and that the leftovers are only good for 1-2 months. It's been 8. Not only that, but as a relative of someone with allergies, cross-contamination is a HUGE concern. What is some of the food got mixed up while being refrigerated/put out?", "The people at the soup kitchen are likely trained to properly store, freeze and thaw the food safely. OPs mother has a questionable food safety track record. For all we know, she was tired after OPs wedding and left the food out all night before improperly storage and freezing.", "Exposure is cumulative.  When it's out on an open buffet it is most vulnerable to introduction of contamination so yeah, that is a big factor.\n\nBut there are many exposures beyond that.\n\nHow was it packaged after being taken off the buffet?\n\nWas it moved from one container to another (another big opening to introduce contaminants)\n\nHow long did it sit before being transported to mother's  Did she stick around for clean-up and leave it sitting or did she take it right home?\n\nHow long was the transport?\n\nHow long did it sit at mom's while she was making freezer space for it?\n\nHow cold is her freezer and how quickly was it brought down to temperature?\n\nWhen she took it out to re-serve, when did she take it out and how did she thaw it?  At what temperatures?\n\nHow long did it sit after it was thawed before it was warmed?  Was it brought to a higher temperature and brought back down, or just brought to warm?\n\nWhat temperature was it kept at when it was re-warmed?\n\nHow long was it on the buffet the second time?\n\nAll of these are factors in safety.  A soup kitchen (if they even accepted the food, if it wasn't pre-arranged they may not have) would be trained on basic food handling, and they would reduce handling risks through their processes.  And odds are they would not freeze the food at all, they would use it more quickly.\n\nIt's important to realize that there are many contaminants that are not killed by freezing.  Basically a lot of them are just put on pause.\n\n*Source:*  I am not in food service (though I have had some work in my ancient past) but am in the med device industry, and deal with similar, often more stringent requirements regarding microbial and fungal contamination since many products will have contact with blood.  But it certainly sounds like mom has no awareness.", "You can re freeze some food if it\u2019s been defrosted in a freezer. A lot of meat sold in supermarkets has been frozen at some point before you buy it.", "> leftovers are only good for 1-2 months\n\nThat's a quality issue, not a safety issue.", "Repeating the same incorrect statement multiple times, won\u2019t somehow magically make it correct."]}
