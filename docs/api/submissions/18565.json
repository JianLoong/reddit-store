It's probably one of the most disgusting textures in the world (at least the Portuguese stuff I bought had the decency to be chocolate pudding flavoured).", "I always heard it was bad for the fridge, not bad for the food.

Lol.", "I was kind of kidding... but... the alternative is exposing an entire house full of mourners to God knows what. Food poisoning actually can kill you.

But crikey, isn't this a pretty good reason to?", "It\u2019s god-awful and doesn\u2019t always go away in a few days like you indicated. In my case I dealt with after-effects and recovery for almost a year. Not fun", "Hmm. Definitely worth a shot. Thanks!", "> You can\u2019t just thaw and refreeze food guys.\n\nFirst of all, the food in OPs story is unsafe.\n\nBut it doesn't have anything to do with thawing and refreezing food--the food was only frozen once unless I'm missing something.\n\nIt's simplistic to say you can't refreeze food. You can, just like you can freeze never-frozen food. The problem, however, is when you forget to take into account all the time it sat out unfrozen beforehand, or in between. So it's not inherently dangerous, but in practice it often ends up being so. But that applies also to never-frozen food.", "It is perfectly safe to freeze food for 8 months, assuming it was handled properly before and after freezing. It might end up with undesirable textures and/or flavors, but it won't hurt you.  \n\nThe concern I would have is food left on the buffet, being covered in germs by all the people at the buffet, then sitting there for who knows how long, then frozen, then probably improperly thawed (because who has enough room in a home fridge to thaw that much food) and then left on the buffet again.\n\nIf the food was leftovers that were never put on the buffet but instead stayed in the kitchen where they were stored hot or cold enough, then they were frozen quickly with little time in the \"danger zone\" and then thawed and reheated properly they would be perfectly safe.  I think that is unlikely.", "> the middle never came down to freezing. Over 4 months.\n\nThere is no way the outside stayed frozen for 4 months without the inside getting down to freezing temperatures. What is possible is that the freezer was malfunctioning and the food thawed.  Then the freezer started working again and the food was in the process of refreezing when you opened it.  Or maybe someone pulled it out and thawed it, ate some, then refroze it.  Same idea.", "Me too! I would get this a few times a year and that\u2019s exactly what my mom called it.", "I beg your pardon?!?", "This is false.  If food has been served, it cannot be refrozen.  It is not safe to refreeze any foods left outside the refrigerator longer than 2 hours.", ">in theory, if the food was good enough to be eaten as leftovers at the soup kitchen\n\nI mean, honestly it probably wasn't.", "That is a really good question.

Then it happened when I was a shift manager at a pizza joint, and the assistant manager got pissed off at me for shutting down and canceling all of the orders we had. He tried to say it would've been OK to send out orders while we had 2 inches of water on the floor from the backed up drains.", "I got hooked on that show for a couple of days during lockdown, and, to my utter surprise, a woman I used to know showed up in an episode (she was the singer who supposedly uses socks she finds in public laundromats as sanitary pads or something like that). Wasn't that a shock.\n\nSadly, I'm pretty sure most of the people are actors, from what I've heard, and she was absolutely someone who'd take a job like that to try to break into acting and to try to promote her band (although I have to question using that method as a way to promote your music). Still, the show was stupidly entertaining to watch.", "My best guess for how this would work is, the caterers have multiple servings of the food. So let\u2019s say they have a salad, a meat dish, a pasta dish and a dessert. If the wedding was planned for 200 people, one tray of each is not enough. So you have multiple. Any of the dishes that were fully or partially consumed will not be donated, but any unused trays could be and those were what the mom took.", "And then Dr Pfeffer goes to Matt, \"should we get a spoon?\"\n\nSidebar, how on earth are we both \"dreams of\" and also remember the Hoardering?", "In the US, that's actually not true.

Had the power go out for about a day a year ago and I was worried about my freezer contents, but I checked when it came back on and most of it was still solid. Probably helped that my freezer was packed though.\n\nAnd I know what you mean with the sense of smell being off. For a long time, I'd question milk most times I used it because I don't use it that often and milk doesn't smell very good IMO.

That's fine, but it it's suppose to be white and it's brown, opened or not, it's BAD! And opened or not, if it's got mold on it, or severely freezer burnt... It's BAD!

If I find it first, I give it to the dogs!\n\nThere is no way to know how long that wedding food was out, or sat after prepared but served the first time.
