The comparisons are in big highlighted amounts.\n\nNow if we're talking a sheet cake, little kids running around in $30 halloween costumes, small decor, and some nice plants then your SIL is out of line and probably crashing from the post-wedding high.\n\nIf we're talking fancy catering, little kids running around in the deluxe outfits that go for on the low end $300 and all the way up to multiple thousands (which I've personally witnessed), fully decorated and a garden with a booking fee then you're solidly an asshole.", "YTA\n\nYour little princess does not need to have all the bells and whistles for every birthday.

This is, however, about SIL throwing a fit that a 5 year old got her birthday on her birthday because her wedding was the day prior. Nope, SIL is an asshole for competing with a small child ON her birthday while also being a bit weird and 'more of an ah move' for scheduling her wedding then if she'd be jealous.
