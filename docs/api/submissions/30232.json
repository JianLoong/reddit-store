A wedding is the biggest and most important party most people will ever throw in their lives and your SIL will never be able to throw another one. She's not jealous of your daughter. If she's jealous of anyone, it's you. \n\nNot to mention, how much planning did your brother and SIL put into choosing a weekend with maximum availability? Did they throw a dart at a calendar and go, Huh that's the day before Niece's birthday, oh well? Or did they have to consult with multiple family members for weeks until they could nail down a date? That was work you didn't have to do, because they made it happen for you. Your SIL helped make your daughter's birthday into the lovely party it was, and you are so uncomfortable with the embarrassment she got in return that you have to make up a false narrative that she's jealous of a kindergartener.", "YTA.

Your largesse toward your daughter may have been beyond your SIL's comprehension, and to retrieve her place as the \"special\" person, she lit into you. \n\nWe all celebrate how we celebrate and, obviously, a surgeon's wife would have more means at her disposal than a couple just marrying. \n\nI assume you two haven't gotten to know each other well, otherwise the child's birthday party might not have been such a surprise. \n\nYou have a secure place in society. You are advantaged, here, so don't let her jumpiness get in the way of your getting to know each other and possibly becoming friends. She will feel bad about what she said soon enough. Also, don't let the relatives make you feel bad about celebrating your child. \n\nYou haven't gone into any detail about the party, so unless you've commissioned a mural of the child's birth and hired a string orchestra to play Happy Birthday, you're probably in the clear and they will quit clucking about it.

Measure it accordingly.", "Your sil is out of line. Being jealous of a 5 year old.", "Wait, Why were the newlyweds not on their honeymoon? I'm confused as to how this is even an issue, the day after my wedding the whole family could have thrown a huge blowout party and I wouldn't have cared because I was out on my honeymoon enjoying my time with my new wife. A five year old's birthday should be the least of her concerns. The whole thing seems silly. Also, is this going to be a reoccurring issue? Is the child going to turn ten, get a great birthday party, then is SIL going to get upset because it \"outshined her anniversary\" when they chose the date of to be the day before your daughters birthday?", "Well, if the SIL didn\u2019t want to be outshone, why didn\u2019t she try to be richer. \n\nJokes aside, I think it\u2019s pretty callous of you to throw a huge ass princess themed party with everyone the day after the wedding.

In your post you say your husband is a surgeon, which is irrelevant, but does point to the fact you have money and want people to know it.

However SIL just did her best to throw a wedding on a budget, and you were able to throw an event for a 5 year old\u2019s birthday party.\n\nNeither of those things are wrong, but I can tell by your tone that this event was NBD for you, and the day before was supposed to be the best day of her life and it wasn\u2019t as nice\u2026.as a 5 year old\u2019s birthday party.\n\nShe felt insecure, probably judged by the family comparing the two back to back.

You could have celebrated her birthday later but if you wanted to capitolize on the whole family being in town than you couldn't.\n\nIt's not your problem if SIL had a wedding she now feels was less impressive than a birthday party. How grand your wedding is isn't the point of a wedding anyway it's about celebrating the marriage of two ppl with friends and family. It doesn't need to be better decorated or catered or located than a birthday party. \n\nIt's about perspective. Your SIL values appearance over sentiment and representation. Some ppl go to a court house then a restaurant with family afterwards. Some ppl marry in the back yard then have a bbq for guest. It's not an expected standard for weddings to be a certain way. \n\nFamily drama is tough. She is your newly made family so I would recommend as ridiculous as she's being trying to make her feel better if you can. You do not want to start off having a new person join your family with bad blood in the mix. It's more worth it to have familial peace than be right. You don't need to grovel or make it up to her but be genuinely supportive about her feelings and reasurre her ppl loved her wedding and won't compare it to the party like she fears. \n\nFamily is prob on her side bc she's emotional and just celebrated an expensive and important event in her life.

Did you complain that their wedding was too simple and throw a birthday bash as competition? No! So  why on earth is she comparing the 2 completely unrelated events.

It would have definitely rubbed him the wrong way if his siblings took advantage of that to throw a party for his nieces. It just seems tacky and classless to ride the coattails of a once-in-their-lifetime event with an even grander event for a five year old but birthdays can\u2019t be rescheduled and maybe the five year old just *desperately needed* a massive garden party that costs more than a wedding.

That\u2019s what\u2019s bothering you, isn\u2019t it?", "Yeah. OP is like \u201cshe had time to respond\u201d. Yeah, \u201crespond\u201d to an invitation you have already sent out. To me this shows OP knew she would potentially be asked not to host it on the same weekend so avoided actually giving SIL a REAL opportunity to say no please or have any input.", "Also the audacity of her expecting a person planning a wedding has the time in the weeks leading up to has time to address this nonsense. \ud83d\ude02", "Yeah, I don\u2019t particularly like the type of people OP portrays themselves as. I know those people and they\u2019re flashy, and they overshadow other peoples successes. \n\nHowever, SIL dealt with this poorly. If that was me, I would silently resent OP for this and finding her vulgar for upstaging a wedding. I would however not start crying and telling her this. That\u2019s a very immature way to act and an unnecessary way to cause drama. So I\u2019d say ESH.", "This! And maybe buy a pink matching princess dress for the niece so they could be princesses together. Kiddo likely would have felt super special that the princess bride turned her into a princess too. SIL missed an opportunity to wear her dress again and to shine along with her niece while making a special connection to her new hubby\u2019s family.", "I'm in the same boat.last year I forgot my own birthday.", "I joked with an ex-gf my dream wedding date is February 29th.  That might be part of why she's an ex.", ">OP told the truth, gave us the whole picture\n\nNo, she didn't.  She didn't give us the cost of the party, a reason why she piggybacked off SIL's guest list without talking to her in advance, why she decided to have a lavish family party instead of a lavish friends party, how often she has done this kind of thing in the past, etc.\n\nOP reads like someone who cares less about her SIL and daughter than in showing off her wealth.", "I get that vibe too. This particular party might have had more guests since more people were in town because of the wedding though.", "My husband called me this week and asked, \u201cis our 20th or 25th anniversary this month?!\u201d\n\nLMAO! \n\nI thought it was our 21st. \n\nLove!", "We remember ours by the age of our dog we got a few months prior. He's 5 so it's our 5th anniversary.", "to be fair sounds like peak covid is when it happened so everyones perception of time is kinda whack since then", "My nephew was a few weeks old , I  started checking  with him . This pas5 August we've been  together  40 years", "I know the date of our first date, engagement date, and wedding anniversary...because it's the same date a year apart each time. \n\nPlanned that shit right!\n\nGood thing we went on our first date on a Thursday so we could get married on a Saturday.", "Same here! We shoot guesses back and forth until we remember we got married in January of 2020 so if it\u2019s past January it\u2019s kindergarten math \ud83d\ude02 \n\nThe hardest part is remembering what year we are currently in"]}
