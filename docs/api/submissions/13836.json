Cringed and walked away.", "Fuck these comments, this is a clear choosing beggar. The brother not only got to stay somewhere for free but then was upset the people giving him free stay had sex. Go stay somewhere else then. \n\nThe brother is a moocher plain and simple. Welcome to being an adult, adults do adult things.\n\nAdults have sex. Get over it.", "ESH. Keep it quiet when you have a guest, but also he should talk to you not her parents.", "YTA it\u2019s literally common curtesy to not have sex lousy if you have a guest over. Would you have this same attitude if it was your mother in that guest room?", "You were practicing some marital activities, on your marital bed, in your marital residence, he is a guest. I actually find the image of running to your in laws and complain to them quite comedic, like:DAD, OP WAS DO IT WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.\n NTA.", "YTA. \nI agree your in-laws shouldn't have any more to do with this situation than tell you what was relayed to them. And perhaps that is all that it was, it was relayed info that the brother felt awkward mentioning to you and his sister. And just as awkward mentioning to his parents. Maybe the parents thought it best coming from them since they are a married couple too and figured it be more relatable. \nWhatever the case, you reacting in such a way is not healthy. It causes tension in a family dynamic where there doesn't need to be. Her parents need to be setting examples and quit with giving you guys grief as well. Y'all are a young couple and these things happen. As for the brother, maybe for now he stay with the parents and every now and then you guys invite him over so there is still a close bond being kept", "ESH like it\u2019s pretty weird to be that loud when you know you have a guest. Perhaps you couldn\u2019t tell you were loud or maybe the walls are thinner than you thought, but that\u2019s still a dick move. The brother is a major dick wipe for getting his parents involved though like that\u2019s actually disgusting. I would clothesline my brother if he ever mentioned something like that to our parents tbh that\u2019s a private matter and I already hate the idea of him knowing anything about my sex life let alone my parents. Maybe you lashed out because the brother blew this up, but i\u2019m hoping you\u2019re the kinda person who could just say \u201csorry we didn\u2019t know it won\u2019t happen again\u201d if he had come to you politely about the issue. Not too late to apologize, but probably still a good idea for him at stay w his parents if he\u2019s such a crybaby about it.", "NTA.

Maybe he called simply being like \"hey guys, can I stay with you instead? I don't wanna hear my sister fuck\"", "Goes both way, can\u2019t be asking to stay at someone else\u2019s house then not be ok with them living their normal life.\n\nIf anything the problem has been solved.

That\u2019s not exhibitionism unless it was intentional and they were getting off on it. It\u2019s just life. Calm down.", "Okay but he consented to whining to the parents instead speaking to them first.

Sounds like the brother is SOL.", "Right?! As their guest why would he think it appropriate to discuss this with the parents instead of his sister first?

None of that is up for discussion outside of OP\u2019s home.", "i mean, given how OP doesn\u2019t see he did anything wrong at all and immediately moved to kick him out, he may be known to be like this. we\u2019re only seeing OP\u2019s side and it still doesn\u2019t make him look good, so", "This is my main issue right here. That he complained to their PARENTS is wholly uncalled for. Not sure why / unable to articulate just how unfuriating this is for some reason. \n\nPetty side of me would point out that if the in-laws are taking his side, they won't have a problem hosting him instead or putting him up in a hotel.", "He bitched to the parents; doesn't mean he asked them to intervene.", "He is an adult. \n\nA reasonable adult understands that married couples do have sex regularly. \n\nSo unless he expected them to be completely celebate during his stay, he shouldn't be surprised. \n\nA simple \"heard you guys having a good time last night, I'm not sure you know how sound travels to the guest room\" would have alerted them to the issue.", "I think it depends. If someone is spending a couple days to a weeks with me, I\u2019m not gonna die by not having sex while they\u2019re there.
