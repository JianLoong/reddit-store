Is your brother going to continue to do this if he ever gets roommates? If he gets married and visits his inlaws, will he behave this way?

I'd first ask my mum if she'd always love me no matter what ... Then proceed to throw him a physical correction to send the message to respect my boundaries.\n\n This type of behavior isn't as acceptable nowadays but the idea that he clearly doesn't respect your boundaries or your entitlement to your property stands. In my experience parents rarely want to get in the middle of sibling issues, even less when both are teens. So you might have to take things in your own hands.\n\n Think of a demand that is beyond fair . I don't mean most fair, I mean past fair, like you gotta make his eyes bug out. Like demand not the money, but he has to go back to the restaurant and get that same dessert to go, bring it back to you and in front of the family give it to you and apologize clearly about what he did. Dig your heels in hard on this. If you waiver or immediately back down then he'll never respect your boundaries. That being said I wouldn't expect to get that, but it's important for him to think you're expecting it. Make him have to cry to mom about you being unfair and mean for not just letting you get walked over and letting it go. Then when a parent talks to you about walking your demands back settle for him just buying you the dessert. The apology will be implied with the dessert, he'll have gone out of his way physically to replace it, learning 1st hand what you went through just to be empty handed (and not just throwing $6 at you to make you go away) \n\nThis concludes my TedTalk lol", "NTA, and maybe ask your mom why she is defending a thief.
