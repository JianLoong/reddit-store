Still rather unkind, but if money is tight, they might need you to carry your own expenses as an adult.\n\nBut this kind of making up a huge debt for your childhood care is entirely wrong.  It\u2019s a way to make you feel like you have to give them your earnings as an adult whenever they demand, for however much they demand, and it\u2019s sick.  They owed you that care, because they chose to bring you into this world and keep you (rather than letting some other family adopt and raise you).

What you said was no more inappropriate than the bill they gave you.\n\nFor the sake of argument, here are a few points.\n\n1. What happened at the age of 13 that relieved your parents of financial responsibility? Why does the bill go back to that age?\n\n2. Your existence, living arrangements, and the financial burden of your life are a result of their decisions. You have not had any say in this and the presumption that you should suddenly be financially responsible is irrational.\n\n3. If you did start paying rent, only going forward, to what new rights will you be entitled? Could you, for example, return a plate of food that didn\u2019t taste very good and ask for a reduction in your monthly fees? Could you make specific meal requests? Would your parents take on the role of landlord and be subject to all the laws that regulate that?\n\nI feel like there is something else that they want from you.

It's ok to have a frank talk about finances, shared responsibilities, fair expectations. I think it's fair to ask an 18yr old HS grad to pay rent. I do not think it's remotely ok to blindside your child with a made up retroactive bill of costs you want covered.\n\nUnless you're in someplace like TX in 2022 on, no one forces you to become a parent. Part of being a parent is providing for your kid/s. If you don't like it, well, you're SOL. Don't have kids; or start charging your kid rent and bills when they're of age. \n\nPsychological torture and mind games will do nothing to create revenue streams, nor will they improve relationships.  \n\nOP, as someone who left home at 16, please take my advice: do your best with the rest of high school. Apply to the most affordable universities you can, and live there. Get as many scholarships/work study/etc as you can to cover everything from school to meal plan to dorm living. Pick a major that will lead you to a decent career, and never look back. \n\nSometimes relationships are garbage, and maintaining them is bad for us. Sometimes you can have a modified relationship from afar.

You are your parents' legal responsibility until you are 18.  They are assholes for doing this.  You are kind to defend them.  \nPeople should not have children if they don't want to be responsible for them.  And while yes, it legally ends at 18, most parents help out far longer.  I have 3 kids in their 20s who all owe me money.  One quite substantially.  I know I'll never get it back.  It was \"borrowed\" but truly given because they needed it.

You likely didn't, so everything they've done for you has been of their choosing with no payment required or expected.  They can't just come to you later and claim that you owe them.  Ask them if they would pay when someone knocked on the door demanding for payment for mowing the lawn when your parents never solicited the lawn mowing service.\n\nNow, lets say your parents are particularly screwy and DID ACTUALLY MAKE YOU SIGN SOMETHING AT AGE 13.

You don't get to bill your kid for the expense of raising the kid you chose to have, and it's incredibly abusive to even try to do so.", "NTA", "You're being abused, bud. Plain and simple.  You may still hold on to the fact that they're your parents etc.... You're being abused.  Normal parents don't do this.\n\nYou don't \"owe\" then anything... And judging by this post, dont walk, but run as fast as you can, the moment you can.  This will not stop. Soon they'll ask you to cosign on things, and before you even blink, you'll find you have loans in your name you never took out. Run!\n\nDon't do it.  Don't pay them anything.  Don't sign anything.  And ideally, put a hold on your credit. ... Yesterday!", "Need more info.  I\u2019m a mom, I love my kid; regardless of their behavior.  But I have rules that regardless of age must be followed.  It may be your home.  But it is not your house.  Meaning you all live there but the bills are paid by them, not you.  You have presented one side.  Are you working full time?  Are you following\nThe rules of the house?", "Dear young man, \nIt is never illegal to ask but they would never prevail if they attempted to collect.  Not sure why your parents would present a bill in such a manner but perhaps maybe they are trying to get you to think about your future.  A future that involves you having the type of career that provides job security, financial stability and maybe a home and family of your own.  Kids are expensive.  The stuff kids do to cause trouble is expensive.  Homes are expensive.  Cars are expensive.  Life is expensive.  \n\nYou are 17 and a wink away from finishing high school (or maybe you have already) and being a legal adult.  Are you ready for the future?  College?  Military? Trade school, Air Traffic Control school, police, fire etc?  \n\nIf it was strategy by your folks, it was misguided and poorly executed at best.  If your parents are being serious about the bill, then think about your future fast.  They want you out at 18.  \n\nYou are Not TA.  You're just a 17 year old kid and all 17 year old kids get mouthy.  I think my dad slapped the crap out of me when I got lippy with him (It was the 80's and beating your kids was standard practise).  How I wish I was 17 again.\n\nGood luck!", "NTA.   They cannot charge you for anything from the age of 13.  They are being ridiculous.\nGet a job and get out of that house as soon as possible.  If they continue to harass you see if you can stay with friends.  They are wrong on so many level.  You don\u2019t owe them a thing for their support.  That\u2019s the least they owe you.", "> I promise they are NOT abusive. I\u2019m also really not perfect & make many mistakes & stuff. Please don\u2019t say that they are.\n\nOh, child. You can beg and plead for people to lie to you and please please not tell you the sky is blue because *it's not! It's green the sky is green I promise it really is green* but that doesn't change that the sky is blue.  You can't just beg people to lie to you to avoid the truth of the situation. \n\nThis is textbook financial abuse and parental neglect, you need to give evidence of this \"bill\" to CPS.", "NTA. Be aware about getting a job. While you are under the age of 18 you can not owe anything. Your parents can raid your checking or savings account, they can take the car that you own, they can take anything you have. If you have a job do you have a trusted adult you can have an account with so your parents can't take your money?", "OP, you had an extremely difficult conversation with your parents.  I think you did great to even be able to sit down and talk to them about it, even if you got emotional.  You\u2019re 17, you can\u2019t expect yourself to be able to negotiate unreasonable requests like this with absolute diplomacy.  \n\nNTA", "Declare legal independence from your parents asap. There are child advocates at most Court houses, look it up for your state. Then you will be eligible for student aid, or loans, healthcare and lots of other things.", "Exactly, and if OP really wants to play their game she can tell them that she researched and found that knowingly billing someone for services they did not agree to purchase is considered Invoice Fraud, and is a serious crime that leaves them subject to both punitive damages payable to you, as well as criminal liability. Then tell them if she doesn't have a zero balance statement by the end of the day she will be consulting an attorney which will they may also be liable for.", "Hey op, just want to say that people are downvoting you because you don\u2019t seem to get/understand that your parents are being extremely abusive -by giving you the cold shoulder once you talked to them about billing you as their child. That is wrong on their part: \n\nI just want to make sure you know you haven\u2019t done anything wrong by asking, and that you know you should be supported.", "Do you actually know what abusive means?  Honestly, do you know?  It's not just hitting or locking you in a closet.  There are other forms of abuse.  It's not just screaming threats either.  \n\nPlease tell your school counselor or a trustworthy adult.  There is something wrong going on here.", "Why does this comment have 146 downvotes?", "I'd feel a lot better if you talked this over with your school counselor and get them to confirm", "You don't have to feel abused for something to be objectively abusive. Charging your minor children for the expense of raising them is both illegal and considered a form of abuse by CPS.", "Darlin.  If your parents are giving you the silent treatment, that\u2019s not ok.  That really is abusive.  Them giving you a bill like that is also not ok.  That\u2019s also abusive.  The silent treatment is emotionally abusive.  The bill is emotionally abusive and would be monetarily abusive if the insist that you pay them.  You are in the right with what you said.  If this is not how they usually treat you, I wonder why that have changed.  Either way, is there another adult you can talk to about this? Good luck.  I\u2019m so sorry they are treating you this way.  It\u2019s more than just not nice.", "You may not see it, but it is clearly emotional abuse.\nAbuse is not limited to physical violence", "I'd also talk to other trusted adults. Maybe someone with compassion will offer a place to live rent-free", "My heart breaks for OP. Forget anything but getting the heck out. I can't imagine the emotional abuse they have endured prior to this... but there is absolutely zero reason for them to stay. Even if there aren't friends or family to go to, reach out to professors who might have resources. Literally any support is better than this.\n\nOP I wish you the best and I hope you know you are worth more than this nonsense...", "Don\u2019t. That was terrible advice. Your parents are abusive and do not deserve to be appeased. Save up what you can and get out as soon as you can. If they\u2019re trying this when you\u2019re 17, just imagine what sort of stunt they\u2019ll pull when you\u2019re 18 and legally no longer their responsibility.", "I'd add financial abuse to that.", "Emotional and financial.", "Like most people in abusive relationships, OP doesn't recognize he's being abused just yet. I know he thinks he's not being abused, but the fact of the matter still remains that he is getting abused by the people he looked up to and loved all his life. Shame on those parents, for normalizing the abuse of their own son, where he's actually at the point that he defends them and their abuse of him. I really hope he reads all these comments and takes them seriously.", "Because people use the upvote/downvote system to indicate agreement or disagreement even though they shouldn't be. In this case, people are disagreeing with the OP that it isn't emotional abuse. Which is odd because they're downvoting OP... because they are advocating FOR the OP. I actual find it a fascinating reddit moment! And also horrifying because it is emotional abuse and I really feel bad for the OP. He's going to have a real hard time for the next year before they kick him out. :(", "NTA Try to see if there is a reasonably sane grand parent that can help or school social worker. Your parents are supposed to make their children pay rent at 13 WTF.", "May you never know the absolute cruelty only family can inflict.\n\nAs an ex foster kid: I can straight up tell you parents are capable of that illogical behavior and WORSE\n\nNot everyone deserves to have children and very often those people then push the worst guilt onto those very children", "You're either incredibly privileged or an abusive parent yourself. Plenty of people have 2 shitty parents, terrible people tend to be drawn to each other. OP is likely being emotionally abused and you have the audacity to blame them or act as if they should know why their parents are doing this. GFY.", "Parents don't get to choose when they're a parent just because they aren't happy with what their child said to them. That is abusive and manipulative. I know it's hard to see it now but in the future it'll click that it's not okay."]}
