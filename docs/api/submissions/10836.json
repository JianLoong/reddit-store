Said it\u2019s not fair they\u2019re asking and they\u2019re my parents and they need to provide me with things. Things got really heated and I told them they\u2019re not being parents at all right now.

As in, they wanna show me what \u2018not parents\u2019 are really like. \n\nWas it really so horrible I said that? They said some things too which is fair. I\u2019m trying to be \u2018braver\u2019 but now I think I immediately went too far. I just feel very confused and my instinct is to apologise again but maybe it\u2019s better to stand my ground (if I\u2019m not the AH). If I am I definitely will. \n\nSorry again for this.\n\nEdit: I just wanna add this because of when I posted on legal advice if that\u2019s okay. I promise they are NOT abusive. I\u2019m also really not perfect & make many mistakes & stuff. Please don\u2019t say that they are. I just want to know if I\u2019m the AH for what I said. (Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right & all that)\n\nEdit 2: I didn\u2019t think so many people would reply & I can\u2019t thank you all so I\u2019d like to do it here if that\u2019s okay. Thanks for everything. Again they\u2019re honestly not horrible but I\u2019ll think about what you all said. I think I\u2019ll try to talk to my gran about all this & maybe she can talk to my parents or something. (Also I\u2019m a girl, not that it matters or something, but I saw a lot of comments calling me a guy haha.) Thanks again, I was genuinely worried about posting but you have been really nice.

Still rather unkind, but if money is tight, they might need you to carry your own expenses as an adult.\n\nBut this kind of making up a huge debt for your childhood care is entirely wrong.  It\u2019s a way to make you feel like you have to give them your earnings as an adult whenever they demand, for however much they demand, and it\u2019s sick.  They owed you that care, because they chose to bring you into this world and keep you (rather than letting some other family adopt and raise you).

What you said was no more inappropriate than the bill they gave you.\n\nFor the sake of argument, here are a few points.\n\n1. What happened at the age of 13 that relieved your parents of financial responsibility? Why does the bill go back to that age?\n\n2. Your existence, living arrangements, and the financial burden of your life are a result of their decisions. You have not had any say in this and the presumption that you should suddenly be financially responsible is irrational.\n\n3. If you did start paying rent, only going forward, to what new rights will you be entitled? Could you, for example, return a plate of food that didn\u2019t taste very good and ask for a reduction in your monthly fees? Could you make specific meal requests? Would your parents take on the role of landlord and be subject to all the laws that regulate that?\n\nI feel like there is something else that they want from you.

It's ok to have a frank talk about finances, shared responsibilities, fair expectations. I think it's fair to ask an 18yr old HS grad to pay rent. I do not think it's remotely ok to blindside your child with a made up retroactive bill of costs you want covered.\n\nUnless you're in someplace like TX in 2022 on, no one forces you to become a parent. Part of being a parent is providing for your kid/s. If you don't like it, well, you're SOL. Don't have kids; or start charging your kid rent and bills when they're of age. \n\nPsychological torture and mind games will do nothing to create revenue streams, nor will they improve relationships.  \n\nOP, as someone who left home at 16, please take my advice: do your best with the rest of high school. Apply to the most affordable universities you can, and live there. Get as many scholarships/work study/etc as you can to cover everything from school to meal plan to dorm living. Pick a major that will lead you to a decent career, and never look back. \n\nSometimes relationships are garbage, and maintaining them is bad for us. Sometimes you can have a modified relationship from afar.

You are your parents' legal responsibility until you are 18.  They are assholes for doing this.  You are kind to defend them.  \nPeople should not have children if they don't want to be responsible for them.  And while yes, it legally ends at 18, most parents help out far longer.  I have 3 kids in their 20s who all owe me money.  One quite substantially.  I know I'll never get it back.  It was \"borrowed\" but truly given because they needed it.  That's what parents do.  \nSorry your parents are behaving this way.

You're saying your parents aren't abusive, but total silence and not talking to your child isn't something that happens in isolation-there's probably other behaviours they are showing that you might not recognise as abusive (I only realised how awful my mother was when I stayed at a friend's house for a few days and saw how 'normal' mothers acted).

I love my parents but they are far from perfect and some of the things they did when I was younger - a teenager specifically- were emotionally abusive. I\u2019m not going to comment on the overall character of your parents but these actions are squarely in the column of abuse. \n\nThere\u2019s something I wish I understood when I was younger. And it\u2019s that you can love a person, appreciate them, feel grateful, and they can do a lot of things right by you. But they can also do things that are deeply wrong. And it\u2019s okay to call a spade a spade. Recognizing abuse for what it is doesn\u2019t negate your other feelings regarding your parents. And it doesn\u2019t make your feelings wrong. People are complicated and the way we view those in our lives is complicated. But it is vital to identify what is right and what is wrong with how they treat you and to hold that knowledge close. \n\nI\u2019ve done this second guessing about if I even had a right to say something was wrong about my parents\u2019 behavior. If it was wrong of me to call out bad behavior when I have done things that weren\u2019t perfect. But the fundamental thing is that you are not required to be perfect for your parents to treat you properly. It\u2019s an unattainable benchmark for when you deserve good treatment. Your parents are obviously not behaving in a perfect manner so why on earth would that be a requirement for you and you alone? \n\nWhat helped me was distance. Getting away from my parents to set my bearings and rebuilding our relationship to a healthy degree after I had time to reflect on what I emotionally needed from them and what I could realistically expect to get. And in every situation that healthy degree is different. Sometimes it\u2019s no contact, sometimes low contact, sometimes it\u2019s a more superficial relationship, and sometimes it can heal to a strong relationship with depth. But at the end of the day if the relationship is causing you harm then it is broken and unsustainable. \n\nAt your age distance is a hard thing to get. But unless something changes in a very dramatic way I would suggest working on an exit strategy for as soon as you can put distance between you. It\u2019s hard to see a clear picture of the situation and your own mental state regarding it when you\u2019re constantly around them. It doesn\u2019t have to mean cutting them off.

NTA. I haven't read anyone's else's messages so this could be repeats of what they've all been saying. Parents BILLING their own MINOR CHILDREN for the cost of RAISING THEM (read: the literal job of a parent) is ABSOLUTELY NOT OK. Not in this world, not in any other that matter to this situation either.\n\nAs you grow and gain experiences, you'll learn that while there's no crystal ball that shows the future, humans, like all the other animals in the world, do have behaviors and follow patterns. Different people have different patterns based on how they were raised and what morals they have (or don't have) depending on nature versus nurture and all that jazz. But what I can see from just the information you posted is that your parents have raised you to be a little defensive about how they're not *that* bad at being parents. There are likely things they've done that make you feel a little uncomfortable compared to things your friends have told you about their upbringings that don't match up with your experiences. While it may also be true that they never physically beat you or did any SA or anything like that, emotional damage is another manipulation tactic entirely, and unfortunately it can be damn effective in getting people to behave in ways the manipulator wants.\n\nNow, I mentioned behavioral patterns earlier, and if your mom/parents are *billing* you for the cost of *raising you* for the last 5 years before you're even a legal adult (again, a completely wrong thing to do and don't even consider paying that bill) then there's a very high probability that when you're an actual working and functional adult who can pay your own way in life, that behavior pattern of wanting to be \"paid back for raising you\" will rear its ugly head and they'll be begging/demanding money from you again, and repeatedly. This is not acceptable behavior. You have no responsibility to give in to these demands. You have no need to fork over any of your past, present, nor future money to these people simply because they were the ones who brought you into this world. \n\nIf you ever choose to go LC and put them on an information diet (which I would definitely and immediately encourage you to do especially regarding your personal finances) or even NC, that would be well within reason and a perfectly acceptable choice. Personally, I'm also a fan of therapy and while it's something that's often recommended to people on Reddit, it's very useful for anyone who has anything they want to talk through, however major or minor it may seem at the time. \n\nSending best wishes to you, girl!", "NTA, what in the world????
