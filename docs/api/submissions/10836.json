Still rather unkind, but if money is tight, they might need you to carry your own expenses as an adult.\n\nBut this kind of making up a huge debt for your childhood care is entirely wrong.  It\u2019s a way to make you feel like you have to give them your earnings as an adult whenever they demand, for however much they demand, and it\u2019s sick.  They owed you that care, because they chose to bring you into this world and keep you (rather than letting some other family adopt and raise you).

What you said was no more inappropriate than the bill they gave you.\n\nFor the sake of argument, here are a few points.\n\n1. What happened at the age of 13 that relieved your parents of financial responsibility? Why does the bill go back to that age?\n\n2. Your existence, living arrangements, and the financial burden of your life are a result of their decisions. You have not had any say in this and the presumption that you should suddenly be financially responsible is irrational.\n\n3. If you did start paying rent, only going forward, to what new rights will you be entitled? Could you, for example, return a plate of food that didn\u2019t taste very good and ask for a reduction in your monthly fees? Could you make specific meal requests? Would your parents take on the role of landlord and be subject to all the laws that regulate that?\n\nI feel like there is something else that they want from you.

It's ok to have a frank talk about finances, shared responsibilities, fair expectations. I think it's fair to ask an 18yr old HS grad to pay rent. I do not think it's remotely ok to blindside your child with a made up retroactive bill of costs you want covered.\n\nUnless you're in someplace like TX in 2022 on, no one forces you to become a parent. Part of being a parent is providing for your kid/s. If you don't like it, well, you're SOL. Don't have kids, or start changing your kid rent and bills when they're of age. \n\nPsychological torture and mind games will do nothing to create revenue streams, nor will they improve relationships.  \n\nOP, as someone who left home at 16, please take my advice: do your best with the rest of high school. Apply to the most affordable universities you can, and live there. Get as many scholarships/work study/etc as you can to cover everything from school to meal plan to dorm living. Pick a major that will lead you to a decent career, and never look back. \n\nSometimes relationships are garbage, and maintaining them is bad for us. Sometimes you can have a modified relationship from afar.

You are your parents' legal responsibility until you are 18.  They are assholes for doing this.  You are kind to defend them.  \nPeople should not have children if they don't want to be responsible for them.  And while yes, it legally ends at 18, most parents help out far longer.  I have 3 kids in their 20s who all owe me money.  One quite substantially.  I know I'll never get it back.  It was \"borrowed\" but truly given because they needed it.

Obviously, it may be hard that your mom isn't working. But you aren't responsible to fix that for them.  And you said you are working so I assume you are providing your own spending money and not relying on them for that.

They are definitely abusing you. It is 100% their moral and legal responsibility to take care of you, paying for food, clothes, lodging, etc. them giving you a bill is outrageous behavior. Them following up by doubling down on the emotional abuse is piss poor parenting in the extreme. You the NTA, but please listen as people are telling you what you are not quite seeing. Yet.", "You definitely deserve better. Historically we have tended to think of abuse as being physical or witholding food etc. However, emotional abuse and financial abuse are real things that have a massive impact and leave people trapped. \n\nI am proud of you for standing up for yourself. I know you're not likely in a position to up and leave now, but you can start getting your ducks in a row. Look into university scholarship opportunities or trade courses if that's more your thing. Try to squirrel a little money away if possible. Keep reminding yourself of your worth becausd you do have value and don't deserve this.", "Why do you think they're not abusive? What they are doing to you is emotional abuse. If you had kids, and gave them the silent treatment after they refused to pay a ridiculous amount of money for no reason, that would be abuse.\n\nYou deserve better, and it's important that you understand this is alarming and abusive behavior. Not only for your own well-being, but also the well-being of other people in your life.", "Trying to believe abuse isn't that bad or isn't really abuse are both coping mechanisms. It can be uncomfortable and stressful to face up to the idea that you were abused, because it means admitting you were a victim at some point, and it means you have to do stuff about it like unpack it, get help, all sorts of stuff that you're probably not prepared to do right now.\n\nSo, denial can help you get through life for a bit, but eventually, you'll need to clear it out and understand what really happened to you here, and what kind of parents would do that to their child. Financial abuse is a thing. So is exploitation. They're trying to wring money out of you for some reason (addiction maybe?) and trying to hurt you emotionally in order to get it. How messed up is that? Very messed up.\n\nIn the short term, I'd probably say something like \"oh, I wasn't aware that I would be charged for living here after the age of 13. Thank you for the notification that I should expect to be billed for your services of being my legal guardians. I'll consider my options and let you know if I want to continue using your services.\"\n\nThen call a friend and see if they can put you up for awhile, because you clearly aren't welcome at home if they just see you as a piggy bank to break. If they want a transactional relationship, you have the right to refuse their services.\n\nBut, no, honestly, you don't even have to do any of that. You can ignore them. You do not owe them anything. Certainly not now. If they say you do, ask to see the contract you signed agreeing to a lease at the age of 13. You can tell them to sue you, see how that goes for them. In any case, try to get out of that situation as soon as it's safe to do so, and good luck.", "I also thought my parents were not abusive at your age. It took me quite a few years to realize they actually were, and continued to be. Emotional abuse is harder to recognize than physical abuse.

Talk to a trusted adult, maybe a teacher or counselor at school?", "Do you have grandparents or aunts/uncles you can reach out to?  School counselor?", "OP - abuse isn't always hitting and violence. Abuse includes emotional abuse. Abuse includes neglect. Abuse includes financial abuse  \n\nyes your parents are legally responsible for providing for you through the age of 18    \n\nbut even outside the realm of super duper illegal and financial abuse - this is neglect, and emotional abuse\n\nand you may not be ready to see that yet. but please please understand that it doesn't have to be *that bad* to be abusive. That bad is simply whatever your mental threshold is, and everyone's is different based on what's normative to them. You might find someone hit with a belt as punishment obviously shocking and abusive in a way that they might find your situation shocking and abusive\n\nand your parents owe you. not just legally but morally. it is their responsibility not just to support you financially, but also emotionally. if they aren't doing all the of the positive things they're supposed to be doing - that alone is neglect and abuse. that alone can deeply impact your brain and your future", "You need to talk to an adult you can trust.

You should be able to safely critique people in your life without the entire relationship being threatened.", "You rightfully called you parents out on the awfully cruel stunt they pulled. \n\nTheyre response upon being called out was not to reflect on their actions, but instead to further punish you.", "That\u2019s irrelevant. The silent treatment is absolutely abuse, no matter why they chose it. \n\nAnd in this case, you were right. They are not being good parents.", "Regardless. The silent treatment is an abusive tactic and the way you're apologizing for them make me feel they convinced you that whatever they do is for the right reasons. \n\nI would ask them why did they have kids if the kid has to pay them back for being born. You did ask the be born.", "But you wouldn't had said they weren't good parents if they didn't give you the bill.\n\nNTA - As their child they raised, you do have a say if they are good parents or not.", "They are upset you called them out for something they are already feeling. Do not put this emotionally on yourself. You are NTA.", "Honey NTA but it was because of the bill, that's what started all this and they aren't being good parents. I wish I had good advice to give you. \n\nYou are not in the wrong here and you don't owe them anything for them doing their job as a parent to provide you with all of the things on that list. That's their responsibility! You didn't ask to be born, it wasn't your decision it was theirs and you don't owe them a debt for the choices they made and the responsibility of their actions."]}
