As many of you mentioned, yes my brother is the \"golden child\" of the family and thinking about it now that favoritism is the main reason i wanted to move away from them so badly in the first place. I had a talk with my brother and my SIL where I apologized for calling their child a demon and for the condom remark. They accepted my apology but they did not apologize to me. Apparently ours and my SIL's parents were just not just telling them but encouraging them to use me for help the whole time. I told them how exhausted and frustrated I was and how much this whole shit show has hurt me and that I would not be watching Kyle anymore period and that they need to figure something else out. They did not take it well and my SIL started yelling again and after some arguing my SIL said that if I would not watch Kyle the least I could do is pay for his daycare and help with some of our other expenses since I have the money to zip off to a different country every month. I was honestly appalled. I would not have minded to help them out financially but the tone of her voice as she said it was just infuriating. The only thing they heard was that I would not continue helping them. They didn't give a shit about anything else I said. I just got up and left their house without saying a word. I wanted to leave before I completely exploded again. 10 minutes after I left my phone started buzzing with them and my parents and I just put it on DND. I read a lot of comments saying I should go No Contact and I really did not want to have to do that but they are very clearly not interested in respecting me as a human being so thats it. I will not be speaking to my family until they want to genuinely apologize to me. Thanks guys :)", "created_utc": 1676714810, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115c3f6/update_aita_for_choosing_to_go_on_a_trip_with_my/", "score": 8262, "replies": ["Sounds like the grandparents of the little \"demon\" don't want to have him around and that's why they suggested you babysit him instead", "Your family is indeed very toxic.

I\u2019m sorry your family has taken advantage of you to such a degree that they forced you to cut contact off for your own sanity and well being.

Keep the distance and you\u2019ll see how good it is for you.", "I'm so glad that you didn't back down over this.

If they can't manage that then they shouldn't even consider having a second child. \n\nWell done for getting out of the situation and ignoring the calls from the rest of the entitled family members. Proud of you. Hope you've been able to spend some quality time with your GF.", "I am so sorry for you, for how they are treating you and for their lack of respect. The whole situation sucks. They are not entitled to your time or money, your SIL even suggesting that you pay for their son's daycare is ridiculous. It's a good thing you left before exploding, otherwise you'd feel bad again. But tbh that \"fucking without a condom\" remark from last time wasn't so out of place if they are not able to take care of a child, financially or time-wise. \n\nIf I were in your situation I'd probably lie at some point and say that my work situation has changed and I am no longer working remotely and have to go to the office every day and thus can't watch the kid anymore. This is NOT a good advise, that's a tactic of conflict-avoiding cowards like me. I'm just kind of curious what their reaction would be.", "The expectation from your sibling, and from both sets of grandparents is outrageous. I struggle with the idea that people are so very entitled that they think they can demand your time, let alone your money, for a child they chose to have. They don't have the right to your time, nor do they have the right to your money. In all honesty, they should not choose to have children they cannot afford. I know people's situations can change, and you can end up struggling to make ends meet, but if anyone can provide help then that should be received with gratitude not with this horrendously toxic attitude to your life being theirs to demand.\n\nThis is awful. I'm so sorry. As an aunt I did frequently get pissed off when it was assumed that I had nothing better to do than babysit - but my sibling would never have dreamed of expecting me to be their regular day time child care.  As a parent I understand the need to get time to yourselves, but my children are mine to cater to, and arrange things for, anything offered to me is a welcome bonus but never an expectation.", "You do not owe these people anything. Your brother chose to take a job with lower wage and less childcare compatibility. They chose to have children. You\u2019ve been incredibly generous with your time.

What exactly are they doing *for you* that warrants this kind of entitlement?!\n\nI mean, I have a self-centered sibling as well, but yours is a category of its own.", "It\u2019s okay mate none of this is your fault. Post some pics from a beach and tell your brother to man up and support his family. Call him a deadbeat etc", "Wow... I can't imagine how sad your childhood must have been for your entire family to think of you as a servant. I'm so sorry, but remember, you are not their servant", "Since you won\u2019t give free labor you have to pay?? I know you said you would have had no issue with that but you should.  That\u2019s a ridiculous request and no where near your responsibility.", "NTA still OP!!!\n\nGood for you for standing up for yourself, your partner and your future! You deserve a wonderful life surrounded by people who love you. Not abusive users who feel entitled to your time and wallet!", "NTA. If your brother and his wife cannot afford kids they should not have them.", "still NTA. Uncles dont subsidise the children of two whole adults.  \n\n\nIf they try to strong arm you by dropping the kid off to your house anyway feel free to report an abandoned child, it's the biggest burning of the bridge but you can't be coerced into subsidising childcare (through your own labor or through payment) for your brother's family.   \n\n\nIt seems that your brother moved to your town in order to leave his industry and use you for free child care. Maybe think about relocating somewhere even further away from them, if you're WFH.", "Just because your brother made multiple poor financial decisions doesn\u2019t mean you have to clean it up. Your SIL needs to get a second job because she already is neglecting her child as it is.", "NTA - well done. Never get into a pissing contest with a skunk.", "They want you to pay for their daycare?!

Don't be a victim here.", "OP I'm happy you stood up for yourself,  but I think you are being a bit naive if you think you will ever get a genuine apology from them or your parents. They raised your brother to think he was entitled to your time and money.  When you stood up for yourself they backed your brother. I'm glad you have decided to go no contact but I hope you are doing it understanding that it may be permanent because your family doesn't seem interested in real relationship with you . What they want is a relationship were you are ok catering to your brother's family needs.", "Wowewww. That sucks. Good thing you stopped. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t go no contact right now. But you should learn more about the dynamic and boundaries and decide what to do from there. \n\nCheck out a CoDa Group (Codependents Anonymous) and/or Adult Children of Alcoholics and Dysfunctional Families (ACA) - it will help you figure out how to handle it.

Sad it had to happen, but yea.", "[deleted]", "Yes, why do they think they are entitled to OPs money?", "Winner winner chicken dinner.", "While the favoritism is obvious, I suspect they made use of of the grandparents previously, prior to the move.  OP says he moved away to get away from his family and this all started when brother and SIL moved closer to him.  I am sure that they had all decided before the move that OP would be helping out when they got there, they just didn't bother to get his opinion. \n\nNow the family is favoring the son with grandkids because.....well.....GRANDKIDS.   As the only single sibling in my family, I saw more than a little of that over the years.\n\nI am not sure what OP can do moving forward.  Tell his parents that if they are so concerned then they should move closer to help with the kids?  Negates him moving away in the first place.  Move again?  Kinda sucks uprooting his life...what about iob, girlfriend, etc?  Go NC?  I don't see his family respecting that.  I wonder how large is the town/city they are in.  Perhaps a change of address/phone number would be in order but OP needs to decide if he is ready to pull that trigger.", "This is very well worded. People can be so crazy sometimes.", "SiL seems a little unhinged, like she has decided OP is actually Kyle's dad somehow. \n\n\nMy wild ass speculation is something going on in the brothers household, they are not happy people.", "Your last paragraph might be better advice than you think. I've read too many stories about entitled people just dropping their children off in front of their relatives houses and driving away. I wouldn't put it past OP's brother and SIL to start doing that.", "I'm not sure OP plans on having kids, just saying :)\n\nEdit: I fully agree family doesn't mean having kids, family can come in a lot forms! But as you can see in the rest of the comments from the person I replied to, they're talking about kids (as was what I got from it in the first place because of the way it was worded)", "It also seems like they like the idea of kids and the look of having a family, but don\u2019t actually want the responsibility. Why even have kids if you don\u2019t want to spend time with them? I don\u2019t think the nephew\u2019s behavioral issue came out of nowhere. That household is not stable.", "Never explain. Never lie. That shows weakness. That shows that he may change his mind if he's caught in a lie. The fact that he's at home can easily be verified anyway.\n\nIf they dare do this, just call the police/child protective service. That's it.

If they are desperate for money they may apologise to you, but it will not be genuine.  You should just say \"Thank you\".  It will be followed with the expectation that because they have said sorry, that you will resume bailing them out financially and covering their expenses, and if you tell them no, they will revert to protesting that because they apologised you now \"owe\" them what they came for.  It is all transactional and conditional with them.  A genuine apology stands on It's own and isn't followed a new list of expectations.  Do not pick up that phone, or read their texts.  They will insult you and call you selfish. They will tell you it is your duty as a brother and an uncle.  You have heard it all before.  Protect yourself and what's important to you because they may try to sabotage you.  \n\nI've been thinking that it may be useful to consider some counselling sessions because although you are successful in your work and all, you have come from a background of being told, in one way or another, that your feelings don't matter and are subordinate to other family members' feelings.  Although you're in the right, this is a battle you never wanted, and victory that can't be celebrated.

I am a little disappointed to see that you would have been ok with helping them but seemed to only balk at the tone of the request.  THE REQUEST WAS UNREASONABLE. The tone would make no difference.

In no way, shape, or form, are you financially responsible for this kid.  Like, the audacity\u2026such a disgusting bunch of humans. Never let them depend on you again, it\u2019ll be the same shitshow.

Now you can move forward, knowing you did everything  you could. You gave them notice, and their reaction is not your responsibility. It is not your responsibility in any way, shape, or form to finacally support them. I know times are tough, and i feel for them, but they can't expect someone else to pay for their child.

Do not let these people make you feel bad about establishing boundaries. You have NO OBLIGATION to assist them in ANY WAY, ESPECIALLY when they're behaving this badly and this entitled. I don't know what the actual heck is happening to the world when people are making demands like this of their siblings (Financial assistant and free babysitting) - no one owes you a THING in life. Handle your responsibilities.", "You got this OP!", "I'm sorry it came to that, but I'm glad they showed you their true colours so you could know you were making the right decision for yourself. Time to go live your own life!", "Good job! Little Demon and his parents fucked around and found out.", "NTA you are not responsible for paying for anything towards their expenses or child care. If they can't afford it go ask the government for help or should not have had a child in the first place. What you do with your money is your business.  Tell Sil to ask her parents or siblings for money. Tell her begging isn't a good look on her.", "With parents like that, this kid is going to be in jail by 20.", "I'm really proud of you.  It takes a lot to stand up for yourself, to ask for common decency and respect from people who won't give it - and then give them boundaries that tell them \"No more.\"  Not many people are strong enough to do that - but your life is going to vastly improve without \"family\" who puts you down and uses you.  Good luck.", "Proud of you. Stay strong.", "IDK if there's conscious favoritism going on, however I do know that most families, and society for that matter, are unconsciously biased towards babies and children. People feel protective of them, will choose to center their plans and lives around them, and even when they are old enough that it shouldn't matter, or there are other viable options, the children will always pull priority by a long shot. As much as this hurts others, it becomes a fact of life that needs to be accepted. \n\nIf you try to talk about it with someone who is choosing children over you, they will most likely become defensive and feel that you are being unfair. It's hard for them to step back and see things objectively, see that there are multiple factors, and that in their need to be protective, they are hurting someone else they care about. People don't like to feel that they might be wrong, especially when they feel so right. It's sort of a catch 22 situation in that either choice hurts someone. \n\nYour brother and his wife do seem a bit self absorbed. It's ridiculous to be thinking about having another baby when they can't even care for their 4 month old themselves. I can understand them being envious of your travel habits and income, but they don't get a say in your life any more than you get a say in theirs.\n\nI hope that you all can figure out some ground rules in how to communicate and treat each other. Because, despite the current upset, I do get some sense that you don't want your relationship with your brother to end. If I might offer a word of advice; if you wait around for apologies from other people, you might end up waiting for ever. Everyone thinks, responds and communicates differently. If you really do want you and your brother to be able to have a relationship, you might have to be the one who helps lead the way towards something the both of you are comfortable with. Understand that this is likely to take years, but will absolutely be worth it if you both want it.", "Good for you, I honestly do not understand where they get the idea that an uncle is responsible for his nephew and should pay for his day care. I mean wtf? Do they have a different rule book or something? One that the rest of us do not have? Ridiculous. Great that you walked away, the DND is also a good way to let them calm down, but they will never see it your way, so NC might be your best bet.", "Since when is it the uncles responsibility to pay for daycare? Who demands such crazy things? Traveling is not childish, its what grown adults do who have the financial means to do so. I think your brother and sil are entitled assholes who shouldn't be having anymore children. None of this is your problem.", ">I would not have minded to help them out financially\n\nReally don't do that... Like ever. I'm an internet stranger (well I hope so anyway) but I'd be so disappointed in you.\n\n Even if they apologise and come back begging because we all know they will once they get fed up with looking after their own child.", "Idiots! All of \u2018em except OP! Pay for child care??? Tf? Like, what planet are these folks on? To think that their child is ANYONE else\u2019s responsibility other than theirs is ridiculous. They are THE SOLE providers for THEIR offspring. Period. Aunts and Uncles are an extension to help occasionally and to be fun, not to help financially raise and care for nieces and nephews!", "Paying for a professional to watch their kid for them is literally the *most* that OP could do, this family sucks.", "I\u2019m still trying to figure out how they thought it made sense to ask OP for money for a child that\u2019s not even his.", "This. OP, you did the right thing. But if you don't have good friends or a support system, I suggest getting out more and creating that support system. If you like a specific sports team, go to one of their bars during games and hang out, or get involved with a certain hobby or support.\n\nSo many people create their own family. I'd suggest you do the same.", "Good book list! Yes, sometimes adults don't realize they have a toxic family because they were raised in it. (Took me moving out at 19 to realize this)", "RIGHT? I dunno what kinda zen OP has, the utter gall of brother and SIL to demand daycare money is nuts. OP had absolutely NO role in the existence of that kid, the family is NOT financially struggling and if they were, there is a far more polite and HUMBLE way to ask for assistance, not demand it. \n\nEveryone outside of OP in this situation has their priorities completely twisted.", "THIS 100 %.  They are far too outrageously entitled and toxic to ever really believe they were actually in the wrong.  If they do come back with an apology it's pretty much guaranteed that it only will be just to smooth things over in a effort to continue to take advantage of OP in any way possible.", "I was actually going to ask this myself.  Not all cultures are the same WRT extended families and the expectations imposed on adult children.", "Probably best for the existing child that OP put his foot down now! Maybe they will change their minds above having another since they have to parent this one!", "I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a fourth cousin or something just by sheer statistics. Might as well take a DNA test. Good luck and share some of that money when you get it! \n\nSigned,\nYour fourth cousin. Possibly.", "For real, that's why she's acting like OP's the father.", "Because people like her see relatives who have disposable income because they don't have kids, and in their mind they have a right to that money since \"it's not like you're going to spend it anyway\".", "I am an aunt. And yes, I don't mind buying gifts for my nephew or babysitting him occasionally or treating my sister and BIL to meals and such. But I would laugh in their faces if they *demand* that I pay for all his expanses and buy them food all the time.", "When you're inside it, it seems really normal to you, too. Like, I was the scapegoat in my crappy family, and I completely accepted that I was the black sheep and a terrible child and awful sibling and a great source of trouble and turmoil until my late twenties, when I started therapy and I was asked to describe *what I actually did to deserve that* for the first time. It totally blew my mind and shifted everything about my world. \n\nBut I was an honor roll student that worked full time all through school and went home every weekend to clean my parent's house and do their laundry, while the \"better child\" was literally in and out of jail and couldn't finish school or hold down a job, and never learned to even fold towels. It never even seemed weird to me until someone made me go through the logical steps. \n\nMy brother getting arrested, or having bad grades, or whatever was going on with him was always painted as being my fault for not giving him sufficient emotional support or practical support. I was supposed to be my brother's keeper. It's weird how common that is in abusive homes.", ">And brother changed careers where he makes less money\n\nThat's what I can't wrap my head around.  Unless he was forced to change jobs.  Either way, it's not OP's problem", "That's crap. My parents actually spend way more time with my 2 childless siblings because it's just way easier to plan stuff with just grown-ups. And my sister and I don't really get gifts from them anymore, they just buy our kids' stuff. Our siblings still get gifts and money. I'm totally ok with this obviously, in fact I think it's the fair way.\n\nYour parents suck. You may need less from them and that's why they feel they can do it but it still isn't ok.", "I was thinking the same thing. I love the idea of WFH somewhere else for awhile. A lovely hotel, perhaps?", ">Why even have kids if you don\u2019t want to spend time with them?\n\nBecause some people see kids as a status symbol instead of a whole other human being. They get to get all the perks of being a parent, like having people look up to them for being \"responsible\" and \"mature\", showing off all their Kodak moments on Facebook for social brownie points, but they don't actually want to put in the work it takes to raise those kids.", "Yea, I completely agree with you! But this particular comment said, \"gf and one day your own family\" and in her later reactions to me, it's pretty clear she is indeed talking about kids. I don't like the implication that one can only be fulfilled or be a family when it is by having kids, so I totally agree with what you said!", "> She doesn't deserve to be able to go on trips, so she should give money to her sibling because he deserves it more.\n\nHe*", "I know a couple of guys that can get you a deal on self sealing stern bolts. One is real tall, the other is shorter and has big ears.", "Agreed, but I was leaving the possibility open. Those were the only two options that made sense to me.", "Exactly. He stays put. If they try to drop off the kid at his house, he tells them, \"Unless you take little kid with you, I am calling the police and telling them that you abandoned your child here.\" If they drive off anyway, call the police and report that they abandoned their child with you.", "My mom and I have four chickens. They are family. We even have a portrait of them hanging in the kitchen.", "Have chickens. Can confirm... They're family!", "Get a ring camera in advance of this situation. Otherwise it's just he says she said", "Get a Ring camera. She\u2019s going to drop Kyle off on your doorstep and then leave, because then you\u2019ll \u201chave to\u201d watch him. You\u2019ll need evidence that you didn\u2019t agree to babysit so you can call the cops when she does this.\n\nBecause she\u2019s going to do this. We see this *constantly* on AITA.\n\nI\u2019m curious why he was forced to take a job with longer hours and a lower salary. It sounds a lot like he got fired.", ">I will not be speaking to my family until they want to genuinely apologize to me\n\nGood job. This is a hill to die on.

Write it down if you have to so you don\u2019t forget. Bc they will be back in the future to try to prey on your weakness - your decency.

Your family is not suppose to be a gofundme or piggy bank to make your life choices easier. They need a huge reality check.", "Wow what a bunch of entitled, enabling, gaslighting a-holes. Please stand your ground and be assertive in this decision of yours. Do it for yourself and your future wife and children. If you don't teach them now, they will use and abuse you for the rest of your lives. It seems like it's gonna be a difficult battle given the number of people on their side. But never forget, if you just step outside of that household, there are hundreds, if not, thousands of us (strangers who never even met you) agree with you that they are in the wrong. Hope you never ever forget this and get taken advantage of. And please don't ever apologize to them again.", "I have 3 kids. Was at one point a single mom. I never ever demanded my siblings help or told them it was their duty, nor did I expect them to pull their weight, because it\u2019s not their load to carry.

They're downright manipulative and are using you. Fuck that noise", "Unfortunately for you, the pressures of social expectation and obligation are a real thing (which I think Reddit doesn't always get). While your family is absolutely out of line, if their custom dictates that you \"should be helping\", then your only real options are to either comply or go LC/NC because they're unlikely to let it go and you'll never be restored to full standing in the family until you \"fall into line\". It's a rough situation.", "I often laugh at how many people in this sub suggest no contact at the drop of a hat, it's the more extreme response to things that could be solved with a conversation.

U owe them nothing. As someone who has worked her whole life, chose not to have children, i stand by my decisions and would never ever let someone make me feel responsible for their choices.

In the past year he\u2019s watched them two or three times because it\u2019s not his job to take care of our kids. It\u2019s fine to help and it\u2019s ok to ask for help but that help shouldn\u2019t be at the expense of your own life. \n\nI\u2019m so appalled that your family feels so entitled to your time and money. I can\u2019t even fathom going as far as to expect a sibling to pay for daycare because they can\u2019t be free daycare for you. My BIL loves classic cars and has all his toys he buys and fixes up. Never in a million years would it occur to us to ask him to help pay our kids\u2019 expenses because he has money to blow on his cars. It\u2019s not his problem we had kids while he chose to stay child free. That\u2019s your money to spend how you see fit and it\u2019s no one\u2019s business how you spend it! Nor should you \u201cgrow up\u201d and stop taking trips to help them. They need to grow up and stop expecting people to raise their kids for them.", "Wow man, sorry you\u2019re family are all a bunch of entitled jerks!! NC is definitely the way to go here unfortunately l. They don\u2019t view you as an uncle, they view you as a free babysitter that they can take advantage of! The grandparents are encouraging this behavior from them because then they don\u2019t have to step and babysit! \n\nYour were absolutely correct that your nephew Is not your responsibility lien they are trying to make them. Yeah it\u2019s nice when family can help each other out, but that\u2019s not what they\u2019re doing her. On top of all that, they\u2019re already talking about having another child to pawn off on you! \n\nNow the grandparents and other family members who called you all kind of names can step up and play babysitter for them. And when non of them do, you can call them all hypocrites!", "[removed]", "OP, you did the right thing! You are not responsible for their life, their kid or their finances. \nIt\u2019s nice to help.

You don\u2019t live for them. \nAn apology from them to you is needed but tread lightly because that apology, if it ever comes, could just be a manipulation to bring you back into the fold of being their whipping post. You can love people but you don\u2019t have to like them.

It\u2019s so hard to set this kind of boundary with this kind of family but you\u2019re doing what you absolutely need to do to protect your well being snd be able to live your life.

At all. What they\u2019re doing is so manipulative and horrifying. :( I have a kid and my parents help out but uncles are for playing with and maybe once a year I\u2019ve asked if they could maybe babysit a couple of hours one evening\u2026 this is insane.", "I remember reading your original post and being appalled at the level of entitlement from your family.  You would be well within your rights to never babysit again and I would strongly encourage you to draw that line on the sand.\n\nHowever, I understand that it is hard to separate from family, even toxic family.\n\nI can see a situation in which they apologize in a way that feels genuine and then later asks you to babysit \"just this once\" and pulls major guilt trips such as your brother will lose his job because they don't have anyone else.  Again, this is not your problem and it is well within your rights to refuse.  \n\nBut if you ever give in out of guilt, about an hour before he is due to be picked, let the kid eat a whole bunch of candy and play a game with him involving screaming, jumping, and chasing.  Wind him up like a little scud missile and let his parents deal with the aftermath.", "Pay for his daycare???
