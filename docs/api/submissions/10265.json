As many of you mentioned, yes my brother is the \"golden child\" of the family and thinking about it now that favoritism is the main reason i wanted to move away from them so badly in the first place. I had a talk with my brother and my SIL where I apologized for calling their child a demon and for the condom remark. They accepted my apology but they did not apologize to me. Apparently ours and my SIL's parents were just not just telling them but encouraging them to use me for help the whole time. I told them how exhausted and frustrated I was and how much this whole shit show has hurt me and that I would not be watching Kyle anymore period and that they need to figure something else out. They did not take it well and my SIL started yelling again and after some arguing my SIL said that if I would not watch Kyle the least I could do is pay for his daycare and help with some of our other expenses since I have the money to zip off to a different country every month. I was honestly appalled. I would not have minded to help them out financially but the tone of her voice as she said it was just infuriating. The only thing they heard was that I would not continue helping them. They didn't give a shit about anything else I said. I just got up and left their house without saying a word. I wanted to leave before I completely exploded again. 10 minutes after I left my phone started buzzing with them and my parents and I just put it on DND. I read a lot of comments saying I should go No Contact and I really did not want to have to do that but they are very clearly not interested in respecting me as a human being so thats it. I will not be speaking to my family until they want to genuinely apologize to me. Thanks guys :)", "created_utc": 1676714810, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115c3f6/update_aita_for_choosing_to_go_on_a_trip_with_my/", "score": 1543, "replies": ["Sounds like the grandparents of the little \"demon\" don't want to have him around and that's why they suggested you babysit him instead", "Your family is indeed very toxic.

The fact that the parents and in laws were also ganging up on you to \"take responsibility\" is freaking nuts as well. \n\nNo contact is unfortunate but your best option imo. Unless they end up giving a sincere apology, with no strings attached (i.e. future child care), I'd say good riddance!", "I say this as a parent, anything you do for others in terms of their children is a gift not an obligation.

I\u2019m sorry your family has taken advantage of you to such a degree that they forced you to cut contact off for your own sanity and well being.

Keep the distance and you\u2019ll see how good it is for you.", "I'm so glad that you didn't back down over this.

If they can't manage that then they shouldn't even consider having a second child. \n\nWell done for getting out of the situation and ignoring the calls from the rest of the entitled family members. Proud of you. Hope you've been able to spend some quality time with your GF.", "I am so sorry for you, for how they are treating you and for their lack of respect. The whole situation sucks. They are not entitled to your time or money, your SIL even suggesting that you pay for their son's daycare is ridiculous. It's a good thing you left before exploding, otherwise you'd feel bad again. But tbh that \"fucking without a condom\" remark from last time wasn't so out of place if they are not able to take care of a child, financially or time-wise. \n\nIf I were in your situation I'd probably lie at some point and say that my work situation has changed and I am no longer working remotely and have to go to the office every day and thus can't watch the kid anymore. This is NOT a good advise, that's a tactic of conflict-avoiding cowards like me. I'm just kind of curious what their reaction would be.", "The expectation from your sibling, and from both sets of grandparents is outrageous. I struggle with the idea that people are so very entitled that they think they can demand your time, let alone your money, for a child they chose to have. They don't have the right to your time, nor do they have the right to your money. In all honesty, they should not choose to have children they cannot afford. I know people's situations can change, and you can end up struggling to make ends meet, but if anyone can provide help then that should be received with gratitude not with this horrendously toxic attitude to your life being theirs to demand.\n\nThis is awful. I'm so sorry. As an aunt I did frequently get pissed off when it was assumed that I had nothing better to do than babysit - but my sibling would never have dreamed of expecting me to be their regular day time child care.  As a parent I understand the need to get time to yourselves, but my children are mine to cater to, and arrange things for, anything offered to me is a welcome bonus but never an expectation.", "You do not owe these people anything. Your brother chose to take a job with lower wage and less childcare compatibility. They chose to have children. You\u2019ve been incredibly generous with your time.

What exactly are they doing *for you* that warrants this kind of entitlement?!\n\nI mean, I have a self-centered sibling as well, but yours is a category of its own.", "It\u2019s okay mate none of this is your fault. Post some pics from a beach and tell your brother to man up and support his family. Call him a deadbeat etc", "Wow... I can't imagine how sad your childhood must have been for your entire family to think of you as a servant. I'm so sorry, but remember, you are not their servant", "Since you won\u2019t give free labor you have to pay?? I know you said you would have had no issue with that but you should.  That\u2019s a ridiculous request and no where near your responsibility.", "NTA still OP!!!\n\nGood for you for standing up for yourself, your partner and your future! You deserve a wonderful life surrounded by people who love you. Not abusive users who feel entitled to your time and wallet!", "NTA. If your brother and his wife cannot afford kids they should not have them.", "still NTA. Uncles dont subsidise the children of two whole adults.  \n\n\nIf they try to strong arm you by dropping the kid off to your house anyway feel free to report an abandoned child, it's the biggest burning of the bridge but you can't be coerced into subsidising childcare (through your own labor or through payment) for your brother's family.   \n\n\nIt seems that your brother moved to your town in order to leave his industry and use you for free child care. Maybe think about relocating somewhere even further away from them, if you're WFH.", "Just because your brother made multiple poor financial decisions doesn\u2019t mean you have to clean it up. Your SIL needs to get a second job because she already is neglecting her child as it is.", "NTA - well done. Never get into a pissing contest with a skunk.", "They want you to pay for their daycare?! Are they fucking insane?!\n\nGood riddance OP\n\nNTA", "Who's going to pay for your kids and watch your kids when you have them?

Don't be a victim here.", "OP I'm happy you stood up for yourself,  but I think you are being a bit naive if you think you will ever get a genuine apology from them or your parents. They raised your brother to think he was entitled to your time and money.  When you stood up for yourself they backed your brother. I'm glad you have decided to go no contact but I hope you are doing it understanding that it may be permanent because your family doesn't seem interested in real relationship with you . What they want is a relationship were you are ok catering to your brother's family needs.", "Wowewww. That sucks. Good thing you stopped. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t go no contact right now. But you should learn more about the dynamic and boundaries and decide what to do from there. \n\nCheck out a CoDa Group (Codependents Anonymous) and/or Adult Children of Alcoholics and Dysfunctional Families (ACA) - it will help you figure out how to handle it. But there are lots of steps before no contact", "Imagine thinking that a person is obliged to pay child support for not babysitting for free. \n\nYou can be part of my family,  I just ask for vacation pictures and hope you had a great time", "I wish you the best, take care of yourself! It's a good thing you managed to see how toxic it is for you to have them in your life. Sad it had to happen, but yea.", "Thats you and your changed and my hormones changed along with my thinking. Each to their own. Meh", "Yes, why do they think they are entitled to OPs money?", "Winner winner chicken dinner.", "While the favoritism is obvious, I suspect they made use of of the grandparents previously, prior to the move.  OP says he moved away to get away from his family and this all started when brother and SIL moved closer to him.  I am sure that they had all decided before the move that OP would be helping out when they got there, they just didn't bother to get his opinion. \n\nNow the family is favoring the son with grandkids because.....well.....GRANDKIDS.   As the only single sibling in my family, I saw more than a little of that over the years.\n\nI am not sure what OP can do moving forward.  Tell his parents that if they are so concerned then they should move closer to help with the kids?  Negates him moving away in the first place.  Move again?  Kinda sucks uprooting his life...what about iob, girlfriend, etc?  Go NC?  I don't see his family respecting that.  I wonder how large is the town/city they are in.  Perhaps a change of address/phone number would be in order but OP needs to decide if he is ready to pull that trigger.", "This is very well worded. People can be so crazy sometimes.", "SiL seems a little unhinged, like she has decided OP is actually Kyle's dad somehow. \n\n\nMy wild ass speculation is something going on in the brothers household, they are not happy people.", "Your last paragraph might be better advice than you think. I've read too many stories about entitled people just dropping their children off in front of their relatives houses and driving away. I wouldn't put it past OP's brother and SIL to start doing that.", "I'm not sure OP plans on having kids, just saying :)", "It also seems like they like the idea of kids and the look of having a family, but don\u2019t actually want the responsibility. Why even have kids if you don\u2019t want to spend time with them? I don\u2019t think the nephew\u2019s behavioral issue came out of nowhere. That household is not stable.", "Never explain. Never lie. That shows weakness. That shows that he may change his mind if he's caught in a lie. The fact that he's at home can easily be verified anyway.\n\nIf they dare do this, just call the police/child protective service. That's it.

If anyone brings it up, say \"I am not going to discuss this.\"  If they persist - walk away.", "My favorite part in all of this is that brother and SIL are presumably still planning to have another child, when they clearly can\u2019t / don\u2019t want to take care of the one they already have.\n\nHonestly I feel bad for both OP and the kid. At least OP can move on with his life, that kid is stuck with entitled and shitty parents.", "What I don't get is why his brother would switch to a lower paid career when he has a family", "Don\u2019t you know it\u2019s much easier for young people to take care of children, and anyone without children has nothing better to do than help parents take care of theirs. /s", "Well they don't need to either really. It's up parents to plan for childcare. Why OPs brother would take a job that pays less and has shitty benefits is beyond me.....", "This and before you go make sure you have a ring doorbell to document if they try to drop your nephew off while you aren\u2019t home and try to blame you somehow for abandoning him.", "INFO: Does someone have Jeff Bezos\u2019 phone number so that I can call him and tell him that the least he can do is pay some of my household expenses because he has the money to, you know, be Jeff Bezos?  Or do I have to be somehow related to him first before I can do that?", ">the least I could do is pay for his daycare and help with some of our other expenses\n\nfor 10% monthly interest rate, why not? ;)", "She is so jealous of your GF and not being in her situation ;)", "He needs to go NC. He is still to soft for that. Give him time. He needs to suffer a little more for that.", "Actually, this would be a good explanation as to why Kyle's behavior changed recently. Maybe he was told there's another baby on the way and he felt he was gonna be replaced?", "No need to lie. Doorbell  camera  , Don't open  the Door and  call the police  if they leave the nephew at the door anyway.   After a couple  of times  when cps is involved  they'll  stop or cps will remove the child from the parents.", "With as unhinged as his family is, I see them possibly doing drive bys to make sure the lights aren't on, no sound is made, & nobody answers the door. If I were OP, I'd look for a new flat to live in & not tell them where/when I moved.", "I cannot understand why the SIL wanted OP to pay for her kid's child care. Like in what universe does she have the right to ask?", "Uncles and aunts  ,basically  no one besides the parents  aren't  supposed  to subsidise  children.  It is a generous  gift if they alone choose to help but aren't  obligated  in any way shape or form.", "Seriously this. Plaster their feeds with photos of you and your gf having a well-deserved blast. Your family can either be happy for you like normal people or they can kick rocks.", "They need to realize  op is a person  and not their indebted slave/servant  before ever getting  to op having a life of his own.  So the answer is no they don't.  Unfortunately.  Massive  ah everyone  except op +gf.", "Found the SIL \ud83d\udc46", "Because OP is the scapegoat and B is the golden child.  It's typical in an abusive/ manipulative family.  \n\nThe scapegoat gets blamed, but the scapegoat also gets loads of responsibility dropped on them.  It goes together, so that when things go wrong, the scapegoat gets blamed.", "Some people with kids feeling entitled to time/money from their friends and family members without kids is a thing.", "And brother changed careers where he makes less money.  I understand the desire/need to be satisfied in your career but if you have responsibilities like raising a child you have to make sacrifices to ensure your family is financially stable", "Because he wants to pursue his dreams, but not take any responsibility or making any extra effort for it.", "I would suspect he was let go and he's making it sound like his idea. Either that or he's moved to a job with better long term prospects.", "[removed]", "I doubt it was by choice.", "I don\u2019t get why anyone would believe this ridiculous story.", "You have to wonder if brother and SIL moved closer to OP deliberately....\n\nIn any event, OP needs to not be at his house the next time SIL tries to drop off demon child.  Maybe WFH from a different location for a week or two.  Otherwise I guarantee you that SIL is going to be trying to drop off the kid again and leaving the kid on his front doorstep.", "It is amazing how grandkids are such a motivating factor for time, attention, and resources. As the childless one in my family, I try to tell myself it must be part biological imperative (continuation of the line), but it still hurts to constantly be brushed aside for my child-having siblings.", "Cause op wouldn't  see 1 cent back EVER  .", "And signed documents, vetted by a lawyer.", "Money. Brother took a lower paying job", "And even more, they think the scapegoat doesn't deserve good things, like money in this case. She doesn't deserve to be able to go on trips, so she should give money to her sibling because he deserves it more.\n\nSo freaking weird.", "This is why i always made sure to be busy or at least have the appearance of always having stuff to do. \n\n'Can you watch Johhny?'\n\n\"Nope, sorry, gotta drop off these self-sealing stembolts before the flux capacitor runs out of unobtanium.\"", "I bet he changed the career counting on OP free babysitting", "That was really the first wave of bs like, what married father decided that taking a job for LESS money for MORE hours was any kind of good idea?", "Pursue his dreams and shove his responsibilities to his brother. Got it!", "You'd think if it had better long term prospects OP would've mentioned it was lower pay short term but would pay off later.\n\nDad's cousin had an offer like that; he took an assembly line job and had a degree, later was offered a job in the office that meant a pay cut now but in a couple years would make much more and wouldn't take the paycut", "Right? It kills me that both his parents and brothers in laws encouraged them to rely on him for childcare", "Then OP shouldn't present it that way", "People are ridiculous though. My sister, as an adult over 50, told her friend how I abused her. She really thought that not giving her my money that I worked for was abuse! She didn't want to bother working. Fortunately her friend is sensible and told her it isn't abuse and I have no obligation to give her money", "Having been in the OP's situation AND seen others behave this way, I think he's probably telling the truth. I had to work my way through college and take a full time course load, and my siblings thought nothing of shoving their kids in the door and leaving. I can't tell you how many times I worked, came home, did homework or worked on a term paper, and was woken by a repeated doorbell, phone ringing, and loud banging, so I could open the door and let their kids in while they ran off, not even asking if my mother was there to care for them while I, you know, went to school. I could have called CPS, but then my mother would have kicked me out. I had one time I was up until about 4:00 a.m. working on school stuff, left a note on my door saying I was up with school work and please don't wake me, only to have my nieces and nephews banging on my door, laughing about the note. My sister's response? \"Well, you should have done your school work during normal hours.\" Yeah, I couldn't I had too many children in the house that weren't mine.", "No.  \n\nHe cannot allow them to drive him out of *his* home.  If they try to drop kid, he needs to call the police for them trying to abandon that child.", "This so much. Hurts that my family always gave all their time money and resources to the siblings with children. Hope to get the exact same treatment once we have a family, though!", ">like the idea of kids and the look of having a family\n\nI think definitely this because they said they are thinking of having \"a daughter\" not \"another baby\". That's a big red flag for me that they are thinking of the image and not the reality of raising another person. Do they understand they don't even get to pick the sex, let alone the gender? That's not how it works.", "I have family like this. Had a kid because all their friends were married and had kids. Kiddo is messed up as is every woman/kid that has come into the one parent\u2019s life. Beyond tragic, and not everyone is cut out to be parents and should not have kids.", "The first time I read this I saw the last words as 'parents + chicken'. \n\nI also completely agree about optional chicken.", "Okay. I'm sorry if your needs were unmet by a stranger's synopsis of a conflict in their life.", "Brother may have presented it to OP  that way and may be hiding the truth.", "This is the correct course of action.", "Yes! I was thinking the same thing. That\u2019s why I asked if she was already pregnant because it\u2019s not like picking out a puppy.", "I've had the same mindset since I was 17yo; I never plan on having kids & I will do everything I can to prevent getting pregnant. Some of my in-laws were not fond of my answer but it has not changed once in 18 years. Not everyone changes their mind; some people just know they don't want kids from a very early age."]}
