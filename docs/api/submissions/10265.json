As many of you mentioned, yes my brother is the \"golden child\" of the family and thinking about it now that favoritism is the main reason i wanted to move away from them so badly in the first place. I had a talk with my brother and my SIL where I apologized for calling their child a demon and for the condom remark. They accepted my apology but they did not apologize to me. Apparently ours and my SIL's parents were just not just telling them but encouraging them to use me for help the whole time. I told them how exhausted and frustrated I was and how much this whole shit show has hurt me and that I would not be watching Kyle anymore period and that they need to figure something else out. They did not take it well and my SIL started yelling again and after some arguing my SIL said that if I would not watch Kyle the least I could do is pay for his daycare and help with some of our other expenses since I have the money to zip off to a different country every month. I was honestly appalled. I would not have minded to help them out financially but the tone of her voice as she said it was just infuriating. The only thing they heard was that I would not continue helping them. They didn't give a shit about anything else I said. I just got up and left their house without saying a word. I wanted to leave before I completely exploded again. 10 minutes after I left my phone started buzzing with them and my parents and I just put it on DND. I read a lot of comments saying I should go No Contact and I really did not want to have to do that but they are very clearly not interested in respecting me as a human being so thats it. I will not be speaking to my family until they want to genuinely apologize to me. Thanks guys :)", "created_utc": 1676714810, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115c3f6/update_aita_for_choosing_to_go_on_a_trip_with_my/", "score": 336, "replies": ["Sounds like the grandparents of the little \"demon\" don't want to have him around and that's why they suggested you babysit him instead", "Your family is indeed very toxic. Anyway, enjoy that trip with your GF! You both deserve a break and the time together.", "I hope that final confrontation eliminates any residual guilt you were feeling! \nI would go NC even if they try to apologize!", "Holy fucking shit. The entitlement that is REAKING off your SIL and family is absolutely mind blowing. \n\n\"The least you could do is pay for his daycare and help with other expenses\" ????? **It's not your child!** \n\nHonestly sounds like they're salty they can't like a similar child free life as you. The fact that the parents and in laws were also ganging up on you to \"take responsibility\" is freaking nuts as well. \n\nNo contact is unfortunate but your best option imo. Unless they end up giving a sincere apology, with no strings attached (i.e. future child care), I'd say good riddance!", "I say this as a parent, anything you do for others in terms of their children is a gift not an obligation. Don't feel bad about anything, they used you", "I just read the first bit. Do your family realise you have a life and that you have a gf and one day your own family? Lol I hate seeing toxic families like that when they fail to see you got things to do for yours! Mate you enjoy your life and mate I wouldn't being going back to them so soon as they will try to use you again over and over. Enjoy your trip!", "INFO: I just read your original post, is SIL pregnant again or are they just in planning mode for the next child they want to pawn off to you?", "Oh man. I\u2019m sorry your family has taken advantage of you to such a degree that they forced you to cut contact off for your own sanity and well being. Suffering for the sake of family is a toxic cycle lie meant to empower the toxic people and put blame on the truth tellers such as yourself. Keep the distance and you\u2019ll see how good it is for you.", "I'm so glad that you didn't back down over this. You can see by SIL's reaction to you setting clear boundaries that she and your brother are not going to change their behaviour. \n\n>They did not take it well and my SIL started yelling again and after some arguing my **SIL said that if I would not watch Kyle the least I could do is pay for his daycare and help with some of our other expenses** since I have the money to zip off to a different country every month. \n\n*That* remark really shows off the entitlement and jealousy. And what exactly are these *\"other expenses\"*? \n\nThe least *they* could do is parent the child they brought into the world. If they can't manage that then they shouldn't even consider having a second child. \n\nWell done for getting out of the situation and ignoring the calls from the rest of the entitled family members. Proud of you. Hope you've been able to spend some quality time with your GF.", "I am so sorry for you, for how they are treating you and for their lack of respect. The whole situation sucks. They are not entitled to your time or money, your SIL even suggesting that you pay for their son's daycare is ridiculous. It's a good thing you left before exploding, otherwise you'd feel bad again. But tbh that \"fucking without a condom\" remark from last time wasn't so out of place if they are not able to take care of a child, financially or time-wise. \n\nIf I were in your situation I'd probably lie at some point and say that my work situation has changed and I am no longer working remotely and have to go to the office every day and thus can't watch the kid anymore. This is NOT a good advise, that's a tactic of conflict-avoiding cowards like me. I'm just kind of curious what their reaction would be.", "The expectation from your sibling, and from both sets of grandparents is outrageous. I struggle with the idea that people are so very entitled that they think they can demand your time, let alone your money, for a child they chose to have. They don't have the right to your time, nor do they have the right to your money. In all honesty, they should not choose to have children they cannot afford. I know people's situations can change, and you can end up struggling to make ends meet, but if anyone can provide help then that should be received with gratitude not with this horrendously toxic attitude to your life being theirs to demand.\n\nThis is awful. I'm so sorry. As an aunt I did frequently get pissed off when it was assumed that I had nothing better to do than babysit - but my sibling would never have dreamed of expecting me to be their regular day time child care.  As a parent I understand the need to get time to yourselves, but my children are mine to cater to, and arrange things for, anything offered to me is a welcome bonus but never an expectation.", "You do not owe these people anything. Your brother chose to take a job with lower wage and less childcare compatibility. They chose to have children. You\u2019ve been incredibly generous with your time. Their childcare issues are theirs to sort- they\u2019ve been very lucky to reply on family (you) so far, time for them to figure it out like the rest of us.", "Wow! What exactly are they doing *for you* that warrants this kind of entitlement?!\n\nI mean, I have a self-centered sibling as well, but yours is a category of its own.", "It\u2019s okay mate none of this is your fault. Post some pics from a beach and tell your brother to man up and support his family. Call him a deadbeat etc", "Wow... I can't imagine how sad your childhood must have been for your entire family to think of you as a servant. I'm so sorry, but remember, you are not their servant", "Since you won\u2019t give free labor you have to pay?? I know you said you would have had no issue with that but you should.  That\u2019s a ridiculous request and no where near your responsibility.", "NTA still OP!!!\n\nGood for you for standing up for yourself, your partner and your future! You deserve a wonderful life surrounded by people who love you. Not abusive users who feel entitled to your time and wallet!", "NTA. If your brother and his wife cannot afford kids they should not have them.", "still NTA. Uncles dont subsidise the children of two whole adults.  \n\n\nIf they try to strong arm you by dropping the kid off to your house anyway feel free to report an abandoned child, it's the biggest burning of the bridge but you can't be coerced into subsidising childcare (through your own labor or through payment) for your brother's family.   \n\n\nIt seems that your brother moved to your town in order to leave his industry and use you for free child care. Maybe think about relocating somewhere even further away from them, if you're WFH.", "Just because your brother made multiple poor financial decisions doesn\u2019t mean you have to clean it up. Your SIL needs to get a second job because she already is neglecting her child as it is.", "NTA - well done. Never get into a pissing contest with a skunk.", "They want you to pay for their daycare?! Are they fucking insane?!\n\nGood riddance OP\n\nNTA", "Who's going to pay for your kids and watch your kids when you have them? Is it a round robin type of deal?", "You really need to stand up for yourself and tell them to fuck off. They see you as a doormat and they're straight-up bullying you. Don't be a victim here.", "OP I'm happy you stood up for yourself,  but I think you are being a bit naive if you think you will ever get a genuine apology from them or your parents. They raised your brother to think he was entitled to your time and money.  When you stood up for yourself they backed your brother. I'm glad you have decided to go no contact but I hope you are doing it understanding that it may be permanent because your family doesn't seem interested in real relationship with you . What they want is a relationship were you are ok catering to your brother's family needs.", "Wowewww. That sucks. Good thing you stopped. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t go no contact right now. But you should learn more about the dynamic and boundaries and decide what to do from there. \n\nCheck out a CoDa Group (Codependents Anonymous) and/or Adult Children of Alcoholics and Dysfunctional Families (ACA) - it will help you figure out how to handle it. But there are lots of steps before no contact", "Imagine thinking that a person is obliged to pay child support for not babysitting for free. \n\nYou can be part of my family,  I just ask for vacation pictures and hope you had a great time", "I wish you the best, take care of yourself! It's a good thing you managed to see how toxic it is for you to have them in your life. Sad it had to happen, but yea.", "Thats you and your changed and my hormones changed along with my thinking. Each to their own. Meh", "Yes, why do they think they are entitled to OPs money?", "Winner winner chicken dinner.", "While the favoritism is obvious, I suspect they made use of of the grandparents previously, prior to the move.  OP says he moved away to get away from his family and this all started when brother and SIL moved closer to him.  I am sure that they had all decided before the move that OP would be helping out when they got there, they just didn't bother to get his opinion. \n\nNow the family is favoring the son with grandkids because.....well.....GRANDKIDS.   As the only single sibling in my family, I saw more than a little of that over the years.\n\nI am not sure what OP can do moving forward.  Tell his parents that if they are so concerned then they should move closer to help with the kids?  Negates him moving away in the first place.  Move again?  Kinda sucks uprooting his life...what about iob, girlfriend, etc?  Go NC?  I don't see his family respecting that.  I wonder how large is the town/city they are in.  Perhaps a change of address/phone number would be in order but OP needs to decide if he is ready to pull that trigger.", "This is very well worded. People can be so crazy sometimes.", "SiL seems a little unhinged, like she has decided OP is actually Kyle's dad somehow. \n\n\nMy wild ass speculation is something going on in the brothers household, they are not happy people.", "Your last paragraph might be better advice than you think. I've read too many stories about entitled people just dropping their children off in front of their relatives houses and driving away. I wouldn't put it past OP's brother and SIL to start doing that.", "I'm not sure OP plans on having kids, just saying :)", "It also seems like they like the idea of kids and the look of having a family, but don\u2019t actually want the responsibility. Why even have kids if you don\u2019t want to spend time with them? I don\u2019t think the nephew\u2019s behavioral issue came out of nowhere. That household is not stable.", "Never explain. Never lie. That shows weakness.\n\nThe fact that he's at home can easily be verified anyway.\n\nIf they dare do this, just call the police/child protective service. That's it.", "And that's when you call the police.", "A family could also be just him and his GF (or perhaps wife then) or maybe they will like to get pets. A family isn't just parents + children.", "A family could also be just him and his GF (or perhaps wife then) or maybe they will like to get pets. A family isn't just parents + children.", "A family could also be just him and his GF (or perhaps wife then) or maybe they will like to get pets. A family isn't just parents + children.", "A family could also be just him and his GF (or perhaps wife then) or maybe they will like to get pets. A family isn't just parents + children. Just saying :)", "Hes only young he might not know yet. He still has his time to decide for sure who knows", "I don't know if you read the rest of his post but he says he doesn't particularly like kids, and very much likes his freedom to travel. Not saying he might never become a dad, but there's more to being fulfilled in life than starting a family", "A family could also be just him and his GF (or perhaps wife then) or maybe they will like to get pets. A family isn't just parents + children.", "At 24 things can change cause lord knows I said the same at that age. So never know what will be in store but his life isn't being a doormat to look after a kid with parents who don't get he was getting shitty with it", "That is what I meant as well", "I hate when people say \u201coh you\u2019re only *insert age here*.  You\u2019ll change your mind.  Or \u201cyou\u2019ll change your mind when it is your own child, they\u2019re so precious\u201d or \u201cyou can\u2019t just wait til you\u2019re financially stable, once you have the kid you\u2019ll just figure it out.\u201d     I was told that constantly for the past almost 20 years and I still have not changed my mind.  It is probably the most annoying response to saying that either you do not like kids or you know you are not able to be responsible for another life 24/7 for 18 years. Some people just know.  And as a women I have had the hormonal thoughts that try to override my logical brain but then I think about my above reasons for not wanting a kid and then the hormonal urge is over.  \n\nEven if someone might change their mind the response is still rude and annoying."]}
