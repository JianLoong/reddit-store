As many of you mentioned, yes my brother is the \"golden child\" of the family and thinking about it now that favoritism is the main reason i wanted to move away from them so badly in the first place. I had a talk with my brother and my SIL where I apologized for calling their child a demon and for the condom remark. They accepted my apology but they did not apologize to me. Apparently ours and my SIL's parents were just not just telling them but encouraging them to use me for help the whole time. I told them how exhausted and frustrated I was and how much this whole shit show has hurt me and that I would not be watching Kyle anymore period and that they need to figure something else out. They did not take it well and my SIL started yelling again and after some arguing my SIL said that if I would not watch Kyle the least I could do is pay for his daycare and help with some of our other expenses since I have the money to zip off to a different country every month. I was honestly appalled. I would not have minded to help them out financially but the tone of her voice as she said it was just infuriating. The only thing they heard was that I would not continue helping them. They didn't give a shit about anything else I said. I just got up and left their house without saying a word. I wanted to leave before I completely exploded again. 10 minutes after I left my phone started buzzing with them and my parents and I just put it on DND. I read a lot of comments saying I should go No Contact and I really did not want to have to do that but they are very clearly not interested in respecting me as a human being so thats it. I will not be speaking to my family until they want to genuinely apologize to me. Thanks guys :)", "created_utc": 1676714810, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115c3f6/update_aita_for_choosing_to_go_on_a_trip_with_my/", "score": 2871, "replies": ["Sounds like the grandparents of the little \"demon\" don't want to have him around and that's why they suggested you babysit him instead", "Your family is indeed very toxic.

The fact that the parents and in laws were also ganging up on you to \"take responsibility\" is freaking nuts as well. \n\nNo contact is unfortunate but your best option imo. Unless they end up giving a sincere apology, with no strings attached (i.e. future child care), I'd say good riddance!", "I say this as a parent, anything you do for others in terms of their children is a gift not an obligation. Don't feel bad about anything, they used you", "I just read the first bit. Do your family realise you have a life and that you have a gf and one day your own family?

I\u2019m sorry your family has taken advantage of you to such a degree that they forced you to cut contact off for your own sanity and well being. Suffering for the sake of family is a toxic cycle lie meant to empower the toxic people and put blame on the truth tellers such as yourself. Keep the distance and you\u2019ll see how good it is for you.", "I'm so glad that you didn't back down over this.

And what exactly are these *\"other expenses\"*? \n\nThe least *they* could do is parent the child they brought into the world. If they can't manage that then they shouldn't even consider having a second child. \n\nWell done for getting out of the situation and ignoring the calls from the rest of the entitled family members. Proud of you. Hope you've been able to spend some quality time with your GF.", "I am so sorry for you, for how they are treating you and for their lack of respect. The whole situation sucks. They are not entitled to your time or money, your SIL even suggesting that you pay for their son's daycare is ridiculous. It's a good thing you left before exploding, otherwise you'd feel bad again. But tbh that \"fucking without a condom\" remark from last time wasn't so out of place if they are not able to take care of a child, financially or time-wise. \n\nIf I were in your situation I'd probably lie at some point and say that my work situation has changed and I am no longer working remotely and have to go to the office every day and thus can't watch the kid anymore. This is NOT a good advise, that's a tactic of conflict-avoiding cowards like me. I'm just kind of curious what their reaction would be.", "The expectation from your sibling, and from both sets of grandparents is outrageous. I struggle with the idea that people are so very entitled that they think they can demand your time, let alone your money, for a child they chose to have. They don't have the right to your time, nor do they have the right to your money. In all honesty, they should not choose to have children they cannot afford. I know people's situations can change, and you can end up struggling to make ends meet, but if anyone can provide help then that should be received with gratitude not with this horrendously toxic attitude to your life being theirs to demand.\n\nThis is awful. I'm so sorry. As an aunt I did frequently get pissed off when it was assumed that I had nothing better to do than babysit - but my sibling would never have dreamed of expecting me to be their regular day time child care.  As a parent I understand the need to get time to yourselves, but my children are mine to cater to, and arrange things for, anything offered to me is a welcome bonus but never an expectation.", "You do not owe these people anything. Your brother chose to take a job with lower wage and less childcare compatibility. They chose to have children. You\u2019ve been incredibly generous with your time.

What exactly are they doing *for you* that warrants this kind of entitlement?!\n\nI mean, I have a self-centered sibling as well, but yours is a category of its own.", "It\u2019s okay mate none of this is your fault. Post some pics from a beach and tell your brother to man up and support his family. Call him a deadbeat etc", "Wow... I can't imagine how sad your childhood must have been for your entire family to think of you as a servant. I'm so sorry, but remember, you are not their servant", "Since you won\u2019t give free labor you have to pay?? I know you said you would have had no issue with that but you should.  That\u2019s a ridiculous request and no where near your responsibility.", "NTA still OP!!!\n\nGood for you for standing up for yourself, your partner and your future! You deserve a wonderful life surrounded by people who love you. Not abusive users who feel entitled to your time and wallet!", "NTA. If your brother and his wife cannot afford kids they should not have them.", "still NTA. Uncles dont subsidise the children of two whole adults.  \n\n\nIf they try to strong arm you by dropping the kid off to your house anyway feel free to report an abandoned child, it's the biggest burning of the bridge but you can't be coerced into subsidising childcare (through your own labor or through payment) for your brother's family.   \n\n\nIt seems that your brother moved to your town in order to leave his industry and use you for free child care. Maybe think about relocating somewhere even further away from them, if you're WFH.", "Just because your brother made multiple poor financial decisions doesn\u2019t mean you have to clean it up. Your SIL needs to get a second job because she already is neglecting her child as it is.", "NTA - well done. Never get into a pissing contest with a skunk.", "They want you to pay for their daycare?! Are they fucking insane?!\n\nGood riddance OP\n\nNTA", "Who's going to pay for your kids and watch your kids when you have them?

Don't be a victim here.", "OP I'm happy you stood up for yourself,  but I think you are being a bit naive if you think you will ever get a genuine apology from them or your parents. They raised your brother to think he was entitled to your time and money.  When you stood up for yourself they backed your brother. I'm glad you have decided to go no contact but I hope you are doing it understanding that it may be permanent because your family doesn't seem interested in real relationship with you . What they want is a relationship were you are ok catering to your brother's family needs.", "Wowewww. That sucks. Good thing you stopped. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t go no contact right now. But you should learn more about the dynamic and boundaries and decide what to do from there. \n\nCheck out a CoDa Group (Codependents Anonymous) and/or Adult Children of Alcoholics and Dysfunctional Families (ACA) - it will help you figure out how to handle it. But there are lots of steps before no contact", "Imagine thinking that a person is obliged to pay child support for not babysitting for free. \n\nYou can be part of my family,  I just ask for vacation pictures and hope you had a great time", "I wish you the best, take care of yourself! It's a good thing you managed to see how toxic it is for you to have them in your life. Sad it had to happen, but yea.", "Thats you and your changed and my hormones changed along with my thinking. Each to their own. Meh", "Yes, why do they think they are entitled to OPs money?", "Winner winner chicken dinner.", "While the favoritism is obvious, I suspect they made use of of the grandparents previously, prior to the move.  OP says he moved away to get away from his family and this all started when brother and SIL moved closer to him.  I am sure that they had all decided before the move that OP would be helping out when they got there, they just didn't bother to get his opinion. \n\nNow the family is favoring the son with grandkids because.....well.....GRANDKIDS.   As the only single sibling in my family, I saw more than a little of that over the years.\n\nI am not sure what OP can do moving forward.  Tell his parents that if they are so concerned then they should move closer to help with the kids?  Negates him moving away in the first place.  Move again?  Kinda sucks uprooting his life...what about iob, girlfriend, etc?  Go NC?  I don't see his family respecting that.  I wonder how large is the town/city they are in.  Perhaps a change of address/phone number would be in order but OP needs to decide if he is ready to pull that trigger.", "This is very well worded. People can be so crazy sometimes.", "SiL seems a little unhinged, like she has decided OP is actually Kyle's dad somehow. \n\n\nMy wild ass speculation is something going on in the brothers household, they are not happy people.", "Your last paragraph might be better advice than you think. I've read too many stories about entitled people just dropping their children off in front of their relatives houses and driving away. I wouldn't put it past OP's brother and SIL to start doing that.", "I'm not sure OP plans on having kids, just saying :)", "It also seems like they like the idea of kids and the look of having a family, but don\u2019t actually want the responsibility. Why even have kids if you don\u2019t want to spend time with them? I don\u2019t think the nephew\u2019s behavioral issue came out of nowhere. That household is not stable.", "Never explain. Never lie. That shows weakness. That shows that he may change his mind if he's caught in a lie. The fact that he's at home can easily be verified anyway.\n\nIf they dare do this, just call the police/child protective service. That's it.

It's because they don't want to do all the daycare and bailing them out financially.  The only reason why they moved to your city, why DIL magically a job there, was to use you, not because they care about you and want to be closer.\n\nYou say that you will go NC with your family until you get a genuine apology.  If they are desperate for money they may apologise to you, but it will not be genuine.  You should just say \"Thank you\".  It will be followed with the expectation that because they have said sorry, that you will resume bailing them out financially and covering their expenses, and if you tell them no, they will revert to protesting that because they apologised you now \"owe\" them what they came for.  It is all transactional and conditional with them.  A genuine apology stands on It's own and isn't followed a new list of expectations.  Do not pick up that phone, or read their texts.  They will insult you and call you selfish. They will tell you it is your duty as a brother and an uncle.  You have heard it all before.  Protect yourself and what's important to you because they may try to sabotage you.  \n\nI've been thinking that it may be useful to consider some counselling sessions because although you are successful in your work and all, you have come from a background of being told, in one way or another, that your feelings don't matter and are subordinate to other family members' feelings.  Although you're in the right, this is a battle you never wanted, and victory that can't be celebrated.

I am a little disappointed to see that you would have been ok with helping them but seemed to only balk at the tone of the request.  THE REQUEST WAS UNREASONABLE. The tone would make no difference. So, you may still have a little work to do with boundaries and assessing what your responsibilities are with regard to the situation.  In no way, shape, or form, are you financially responsible for this kid.  Like, the audacity\u2026such a disgusting bunch of humans. Never let them depend on you again, it\u2019ll be the same shitshow.

It is not your responsibility in any way, shape, or form to finacally support them. I know times are tough, and i feel for them, but they can't expect someone else to pay for their child.

Seeing this update, I'm firmly convinced your brother AND especially your SIL are two people who needed to hear the words you spoke to them in the first post. Do not let these people make you feel bad about establishing boundaries. You have NO OBLIGATION to assist them in ANY WAY, ESPECIALLY when they're behaving this badly and this entitled. I don't know what the actual heck is happening to the world when people are making demands like this of their siblings (Financial assistant and free babysitting) - no one owes you a THING in life. Handle your responsibilities.", "You got this OP!", "I'm sorry it came to that, but I'm glad they showed you their true colours so you could know you were making the right decision for yourself. Time to go live your own life!", "Good job! Little Demon and his parents fucked around and found out.", "NTA you are not responsible for paying for anything towards their expenses or child care. If they can't afford it go ask the government for help or should not have had a child in the first place. What you do with your money is your business.  Tell Sil to ask her parents or siblings for money. Tell her begging isn't a good look on her.", "With parents like that, this kid is going to be in jail by 20.", "I'm really proud of you.  It takes a lot to stand up for yourself, to ask for common decency and respect from people who won't give it - and then give them boundaries that tell them \"No more.\"  Not many people are strong enough to do that - but your life is going to vastly improve without \"family\" who puts you down and uses you.  Good luck.", "Proud of you. Stay strong.", "IDK if there's conscious favoritism going on, however I do know that most families, and society for that matter, are unconsciously biased towards babies and children. People feel protective of them, will choose to center their plans and lives around them, and even when they are old enough that it shouldn't matter, or there are other viable options, the children will always pull priority by a long shot. As much as this hurts others, it becomes a fact of life that needs to be accepted. \n\nIf you try to talk about it with someone who is choosing children over you, they will most likely become defensive and feel that you are being unfair. It's hard for them to step back and see things objectively, see that there are multiple factors, and that in their need to be protective, they are hurting someone else they care about. People don't like to feel that they might be wrong, especially when they feel so right. It's sort of a catch 22 situation in that either choice hurts someone. \n\nYour brother and his wife do seem a bit self absorbed. It's ridiculous to be thinking about having another baby when they can't even care for their 4 month old themselves. I can understand them being envious of your travel habits and income, but they don't get a say in your life any more than you get a say in theirs.\n\nI hope that you all can figure out some ground rules in how to communicate and treat each other. Because, despite the current upset, I do get some sense that you don't want your relationship with your brother to end. If I might offer a word of advice; if you wait around for apologies from other people, you might end up waiting for ever. Everyone thinks, responds and communicates differently. If you really do want you and your brother to be able to have a relationship, you might have to be the one who helps lead the way towards something the both of you are comfortable with. Understand that this is likely to take years, but will absolutely be worth it if you both want it.", "Good for you, I honestly do not understand where they get the idea that an uncle is responsible for his nephew and should pay for his day care. I mean wtf? Do they have a different rule book or something? One that the rest of us do not have? Ridiculous. Great that you walked away, the DND is also a good way to let them calm down, but they will never see it your way, so NC might be your best bet.", "Since when is it the uncles responsibility to pay for daycare? Who demands such crazy things? Traveling is not childish, its what grown adults do who have the financial means to do so. I think your brother and sil are entitled assholes who shouldn't be having anymore children. None of this is your problem.", ">I would not have minded to help them out financially\n\nReally don't do that... Like ever. I'm an internet stranger (well I hope so anyway) I'd be so disappointed in you.\n\n Even if they apologise and come back begging because we all know they will once they get fed up with looking after their own child.", "Idiots! All of \u2018em except OP! Pay for child care??? Tf? Like, what planet are these folks on? To think that their child is ANYONE else\u2019s responsibility other than theirs is ridiculous. They are THE SOLE providers for THEIR offspring. Period. Aunts and Uncles are an extension to help occasionally and to be fun, not to help financially raise and care for nieces and nephews!", "Paying for a professional to watch their kid for them is literally the *most* that OP could do, this family sucks.", "I\u2019m still trying to figure out how they thought it made sense to ask OP for money for a child that\u2019s not even his.", "This. OP, you did the right thing. But if you don't have good friends or a support system, I suggest getting out more and creating that support system. If you like a specific sports team, go to one of their bars during games and hang out, or get involved with a certain hobby or support.\n\nSo many people create their own family. I'd suggest you do the same.", "Good book list! Yes, sometimes adults don't realize they have a toxic family because they were raised in it. (Took me moving out at 19 to realize this)", "RIGHT? I dunno what kinda zen OP has, the utter gall of brother and SIL to demand daycare money is nuts. OP had absolutely NO role in the existence of that kid, the family is NOT financially struggling and if they were, there is a far more polite and HUMBLE way to ask for assistance, not demand it. \n\nEveryone outside of OP in this situation has their priorities completely twisted.", "THIS 100 %.  They are far too outrageously entitled and toxic to ever really believe they were actually in the wrong.  If they do come back with an apology it's pretty much guaranteed that it only will be just to smooth things over in a effort to continue to take advantage of OP in any way possible.", "I was actually going to ask this myself.  Not all cultures are the same WRT extended families and the expectations imposed on adult children.", "Probably best for the existing child that OP put his foot down now! Maybe they will change their minds above having another since they have to parent this one!", "I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a fourth cousin or something just by sheer statistics. Might as well take a DNA test. Good luck and share some of that money when you get it! \n\nSigned,\nYour fourth cousin. Possibly.", "For real, that's why she's acting like OP's the father.", "Because people like her see relatives who have disposable income because they don't have kids, and in their mind they have a right to that money since \"it's not like you're going to spend it anyway\".", "I am an aunt. And yes, I don't mind buying gifts for my nephew or babysitting him occasionally or treating my sister and BIL to meals and such. But I would laugh in their faces if they *demand* that I pay for all his expanses and buy them food all the time.", "When you're inside it, it seems really normal to you, too. Like, I was the scapegoat in my crappy family, and I completely accepted that I was the black sheep and a terrible child and awful sibling and a great source of trouble and turmoil until my late twenties, when I started therapy and I was asked to describe *what I actually did to deserve that* for the first time. It totally blew my mind and shifted everything about my world. \n\nBut I was an honor roll student that worked full time all through school and went home every weekend to clean my parent's house and do their laundry, while the \"better child\" was literally in and out of jail and couldn't finish school or hold down a job, and never learned to even fold towels. It never even seemed weird to me until someone made me go through the logical steps. \n\nMy brother getting arrested, or having bad grades, or whatever was going on with him was always painted as being my fault for not giving him sufficient emotional support or practical support. I was supposed to be my brother's keeper. It's weird how common that is in abusive homes.", ">And brother changed careers where he makes less money\n\nThat's what I can't wrap my head around.  Unless he was forced to change jobs.  Either way, it's not OP's problem", "That's crap. My parents actually spend way more time with my 2 childless siblings because it's just way easier to plan stuff with just grown-ups. And my sister and I don't really get gifts from them anymore, they just buy our kids' stuff. Our siblings still get gifts and money. I'm totally ok with this obviously, in fact I think it's the fair way.\n\nYour parents suck. You may need less from them and that's why they feel they can do it but it still isn't ok.", "I was thinking the same thing. I love the idea of WFH somewhere else for awhile. A lovely hotel, perhaps?", ">Why even have kids if you don\u2019t want to spend time with them?\n\nBecause some people see kids as a status symbol instead of a whole other human being. They get to get all the perks of being a parent, like having people look up to them for being \"responsible\" and \"mature\", showing off all their Kodak moments on Facebook for social brownie points, but they don't actually want to put in the work it takes to raise those kids.", "Yea, I completely agree with you! But this particular comment said, \"gf and one day your own family\" and in her later reactions to me, it's pretty clear she is indeed talking about kids. I don't like the implication that one can only be fulfilled or be a family when it is by having kids, so I totally agree with what you said!", "> She doesn't deserve to be able to go on trips, so she should give money to her sibling because he deserves it more.\n\nHe*", "I know a couple of guys that can get you a deal on self sealing stern bolts. One is real tall, the other is shorter and has big ears.", "Agreed, but I was leaving the possibility open. Those were the only two options that made sense to me.", "Exactly. He stays put. If they try to drop off the kid at his house, he tells them, \"Unless you take little kid with you, I am calling the police and telling them that you abandoned your child here.\" If they drive off anyway, call the police and report that they abandoned their child with you.", "My mom and I have four chickens. They are family. We even have a portrait of them hanging in the kitchen.", "Have chickens. Can confirm... They're family!", "Get a ring camera in advance of this situation. Otherwise it's just he says she said"]}
