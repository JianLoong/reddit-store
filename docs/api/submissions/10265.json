As many of you mentioned, yes my brother is the \"golden child\" of the family and thinking about it now that favoritism is the main reason i wanted to move away from them so badly in the first place. I had a talk with my brother and my SIL where I apologized for calling their child a demon and for the condom remark. They accepted my apology but they did not apologize to me. Apparently ours and my SIL's parents were just not just telling them but encouraging them to use me for help the whole time. I told them how exhausted and frustrated I was and how much this whole shit show has hurt me and that I would not be watching Kyle anymore period and that they need to figure something else out. They did not take it well and my SIL started yelling again and after some arguing my SIL said that if I would not watch Kyle the least I could do is pay for his daycare and help with some of our other expenses since I have the money to zip off to a different country every month. I was honestly appalled. I would not have minded to help them out financially but the tone of her voice as she said it was just infuriating. The only thing they heard was that I would not continue helping them. They didn't give a shit about anything else I said. I just got up and left their house without saying a word. I wanted to leave before I completely exploded again. 10 minutes after I left my phone started buzzing with them and my parents and I just put it on DND. I read a lot of comments saying I should go No Contact and I really did not want to have to do that but they are very clearly not interested in respecting me as a human being so thats it. I will not be speaking to my family until they want to genuinely apologize to me.

The entitlement that is REAKING off your SIL and family is absolutely mind blowing. \n\n\"The least you could do is pay for his daycare and help with other expenses\" ????? **It's not your child!** \n\nHonestly sounds like they're salty they can't like a similar child free life as you. The fact that the parents and in laws were also ganging up on you to \"take responsibility\" is freaking nuts as well. \n\nNo contact is unfortunate but your best option imo. Unless they end up giving a sincere apology, with no strings attached (i.e. future child care), I'd say good riddance!", "I say this as a parent, anything you do for others in terms of their children is a gift not an obligation. Don't feel bad about anything, they used you", "I just read the first bit. Do your family realise you have a life and that you have a gf and one day your own family? Lol I hate seeing toxic families like that when they fail to see you got things to do for yours! Mate you enjoy your life and mate I wouldn't being going back to them so soon as they will try to use you again over and over. Enjoy your trip!", "INFO: I just read your original post, is SIL pregnant again or are they just in planning mode for the next child they want to pawn off to you?", "Oh man. I\u2019m sorry your family has taken advantage of you to such a degree that they forced you to cut contact off for your own sanity and well being. Suffering for the sake of family is a toxic cycle lie meant to empower the toxic people and put blame on the truth tellers such as yourself. Keep the distance and you\u2019ll see how good it is for you."]}
