With that and your birthdate she can do all all kinds of things in your name.  \ud83d\ude31", "NTA\n\nJust FYI: \n\nNo, to be a beneficiary doesn't require a SSN. My mom didn't have any of her kids SSN, and we all still received monies from her estate. It's easier if the Executor has it,  but it's definitely not a requirement.  She should set up trust funds for her kids.  \n\nWhen someone states their 'wish' is their kids go to XYZ relative(s),  it's not an automatic given that's where their children will go.  \n\nEven my friend, who was to get her grandchild, had to go through a background check, etc, before she was given legal custody. One of the first things the lawyer asked was if she was willing to take the child. (Not sure what would happen if she said 'no')", "She may be asking for SSN because there may be a life insurance policy that she is trying to cash out. Do more research.

You\u2019re NTA for not wanting to take her children if something happens to her, you are not responsible for them.", "NTA. \n\nShe doesn't need your SSN to put you as her children's guardian in her will. Giving out your SSN puts you at risk of identity theft.\n\nWhy did she inherit almost all your mother's assets while you inherited a mere $250.\n\nSomething is going on there.", "NTA, and this is super suspicious. \n\nRegarding the kids, the hypothetical situation would be sad, but it is not doing them any favors to live with an adult who does not want anything to do with them. That's not AH behavior on either part, it's just a fact.\n\nMore importantly, she absolutely does not need your SSN for anything mentioned whatsoever. Keep an eye on your credit (might want to freeze your credit), I'd say there's a high likelihood she's looking to open credit cards or take loans in your name after she burns through what she got from your mother's estate.", "Why did your mom leave everything to your sister? Why was is not split evenly?", "The wound of your mother\u2019s passing is still raw. So is the resentment. Even in death she rewarded all your sister\u2019s bad decisions and not reward you equally. \n\nNTA for putting yourself first. Otherwise your sister will be dragging you in to take your mother\u2019s place.", "Contact lawyer and see if your mom had any other policies that named you as a beneficiary.

Sounds like she wants your SSN for that maybe, or for something shady. \n\nI definitely think she\u2019s up to something here though and it\u2019s not her will!", "NTA.\n\nShe also doesn't need your SSN to name you as a beneficiary in her will. She can name you and your contact information.", "NTA direct and to the point. I love it.", "I've never heard of needing something like an SNN to add someone as a beneficiary and guardian in a will. As far as I know, you just need to name them, possibly their relationship to you and the kids, nothing else. I'd be very suspicious about what she wanted your SNN for, because it wasn't to put you in her will. \n\nAlso, NTA. You're childfree and happy that way. You had a strained relationship with your sister and now have zero relationship with her. That means you also have zero relationship with the kids. Placing them with you would be the same as placing them with a total stranger, but worse, because you don't want kids. That's not just bad for you, but bad for the kids too, who will know they're not wanted. \n\nJust so you're aware, if she adds you as beneficiary/guardian anyway, I believe you can refuse. You can turn down anything she left to you, which will be reabsorbed into the estate or added to something else, like a trust for the kids. And you can definitely refuse guardianship of the kids. If such a thing ever does come up, with you as a named guardian, just say you can't take them, or even won't because you probably wouldn't be good at it anyway given you don't want kids. They'll either go to the next named guardian, a different family member, like their father's, if they agree, or into foster care. But being named as a guardian in the will would not obligate you to take the kids.", "NTA it's absoultely NOT your problem or job to raise her kids if something happens to them.

However, you can be the beneficiary of her stuff without taking command of her children after she's gone. Unethical life hack!\n\nI would be wary of her asking for your SSN, but she would need it for 401k and bank account beneficiary info and stuff like that.\n\nIf you want guardianship of the children, you have to petition the court to become their guardian. They don't just plop them on your doorstep after your sister dies.", "NTA, the idiot with 3 kids from 3 different fathers that she doesn't talk to is. The kids have little chance being productive members of society and you don't need to be around to watch that.", "You do not need a SSN to be listed as a beneficiary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Do not give your sister your SSN!", "The whole situation sucks. Sounds like she is a sucky mom, their dads are sucky dads. Add in the passing of your mother and inheritance issues. Its a perfect storm for everyone to be angry about everything. Is a shame the kids are getting caught in the middle. I wish you well.", "It was a rather cold way to put it, but I suppose there isn't really a polite way to decline such a request.  It is your right to refuse it, though.

Odds are nothing will happen to your sister anyway.\n\nLater you said you have aunts and cousins, so there is other family.\n\nIf I was one of your sister's kids, and she died, I'd not want to live with someone who didn't want me. I'd feel that.\n\nI'd urge you to get some counseling though. Grief is hard to go through by yourself.", "NTA.  Those children have (presumably) living legal fathers whose parental rights would trump whatever your sister put in the Will anyway.  You can't just hand off children like property.  You can certainly make your wishes about a guardian known should both parents pass away, which my husband and I did in our joint Will/trust, but if one legal parent is still alive and that person wants custody, that parent will get it.\n\nSSN is not required info to appoint a guardian should both parents die.  It might be required for something like an inherited IRA/401k since those have tax implications; I'd have to double-check mine to verify.", "NTA. You don't have a relationship with your sister or her kids.  She must have someone in her life that would be willing to take on that responsibility. If she doesn't, that is on her.  It is NOT your responsibility. You may share DNA but you don't share anything else \n\n I love my sister's kids and said I would be part of the team that loved and supported her kids if something happened to her but I didn't want to raise them.  She was good with that.", "Her kids have dads. That's what should happen to them if she isn't available to parent them. They actually have another parent.\n\nNTA.", "NTA!

I'd ask your sister, \"If the only family you have left does not want anything to do with you, should that not tell you something about the way you act?  You have 3 kids from 3 different men.  You don't talk to the baby daddys and I doubt they're paying any child support.  I am happy with the life I have and I'm not going to be your fill in for mom now that she is gone.\"\n\nI also would not give her your SSN for any reason.  Yes she might need it to name you a beneficiary of the 401K but if she names you in her will, they'll get it to you without the SSN.  But is she trustworthy enough to have your SSN?  There's a lot of other things she can do with your name, SSN, and birthdate that would mess up your credit.", "INFO: in what way did your sister use her kids to manipulate your mom? It's clear you hate your sister, however, this would be easier to judge if we had examples. Because even if you dislike your sister, you are being really callous about the kids. Obviously you don't have to take them in, but you don't seem to care about them at all", "Yikes. I guess NTA, as you aren\u2019t obligated to care for anyone else\u2019s children.", "NTA. It is not your vanity project and it is fair you don't want to be manipulated into it.", "NAH, but definitely don't give out your SSN. They do ask for it with this sort of paperwork, but it's optional. It's not required. It's nice to have so they can identify you without dispute, but your name, DOB, and address are enough.\n\nAnd if you don't want to be a guardian for these kids, that's valid. It's just the choice I'd make myself, but I respect your right to not be a guardian if you don't want to. It's good you were honest about that.", "YTA for being so callous towards children that haven't done anything to you. Claiming that she's trying to \"manipulate you\" by making a request that most siblings would grant and not caring if your nieces/nephews end up in foster care? Basically you've already made up your mind that your sister is evil and is assuming the worst when really she's just trying to make sure her kids are alright if the worst was to happen, which is exactly what a mother should do.", "YTA for the foster care comment. That was a step too far.\n\nI can understand how OP could feel devalued by her mom's leaving everything of value to the sister, and a token amount to OP. It seems like sister got their mom to provide a lot of support to her and the kids while she lived, and continued to make them her only concern in her will. \n\nSister has been comfortable estranging the fathers of her kids with mom providing support. Now she'll need to advocate for the kids' RIGHTS to support from their other parent. Each dad's family is their child's family, too. Sister has been comfortable ignoring that side of each kid's family, yet they do exist. No more and no less than OP, each dad's extended family is equally connected to the child of their brother/son/nephew.", "I mean, you were clearly child free and your mom wanted to make sure her grandkids were taken care off.\n\nThis is one of those cases where you apparently were unhappy you couldn't profit of your mom's death, which imho is always appalling.\n\nYou not wanting to deal with the responsibility, NAH.\n\nBut it's obvious your mom knew you wouldn't hence why she made sure your sister and her kids got as much as possible.", "NTA, but one day you will need to address your relationship with your sister. Yes she's an ex addict (hopefully) and lives in the house. But she lived with your mom and her kids there. It would have been nice if your mom left 50/50 split of home. But something tells me there is more to that story.", "You're NTA for cutting contact with your sister, and I'd be extremely cautious with any information you give her. She does not sound trustworthy.\n\nHowever, if a day came that you were the only thing between those kids and the system and you still chose your personal peace over their wellbeing then yeah, that's an AH move. There's not enough info about their ages and your relationship with them for us to judge, but I'd be carefully examining your values on that part, outside your contention with your sister. Presumably, the kids are innocent in all this. Fortunately, it's unlikely that will ever happen, and being up front with your sister now gives her the opportunity to find someone better able to take on that responsibility.", "ESH.\n\nYes, you're well within your right to decline looking after these children should something happen to your sister, but given the fact she doesn't speak or have any contract with the men that fathered these children, it seems they will go into foster care. \n\nYour sister's actions are not the fault of those children, so they don't deserved to be punished the same, which to some degree they will be if they don't grow up with family.", "I want to say YTA. but I absolutely adore my niece and nephew and would be there in a heartbeat to take care of them. They do have a father, but he's not a good father at all.  My sister has also manipulated my parents in many ways but  I would never hold that against the innocent children.\n\n\nHowever, your family dynamic is completely different, and I'm guessing you're not close to your nieces and nephews.  Therefore, I can understand why you wouldn't want them, but I can't empathize with you because I would do anything for my niece and nephew. \n\n\nSo, based on what you described, I would say NTA. Those kids need to go to a loving home, and if you were to take care of them, you'd be resentful and miserable your whole life. And that would affect the kids as well.", "You are not responsible of your nephews, that's true. But being ok to send them to foster care if something improvable happens it's an AH move. \n\nYTA", "YTA. You suck.

Doesn't matter if your sister manipulated your mom by saying \"if you die, where do we go\" or if your mom thought about it on her own or if at the time your mom made the Will there was roughly the same amount of money in her bank account you received as the house value.... the point is,  your mom set your sister up to have the means to look after her children and their future whether she's in it or not. \n\nIf she names you the guardian of her children in her Will and your sister passes away,  you do not have to accept that responsibility, you can tell the lawyer \"no\" and the lawyer will take it from there. \n\nYou don't have a good relationship with your sister and that may be putting it nicely. Grieving children will often talk about what an angel their mom is and talk about their memories of their mom.   This will create a hostile environment in your home.  No one's fault,  just reality based on the dynamics of your relationship with your sister. That would not be a good environment for the kids or you. \n\nShe the mother and it's her responsibility not yours.  She can ask, you can say no. She can ask her father if the kids, her friends, relatives, talk to an attorney for advice. \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. No one can force the responsibility of raising someone else's kids to you.

You should definitely not agree to that if you're not actually on board to do it.

I'm assuming it is born out of a resentment of feeling like she was your mom's favorite, based on the inheritance and the included info that she has children with 3 different men? But just because it's not what your sister wanted to hear, doesn't mean it isn't incredibly important that you be honest and straightforward about this; with kids involved, you can't afford to give any indication that you'll be open to this.
