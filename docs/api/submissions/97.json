I don't honestly see a better way out of this. You expressed your concerns and your upsets civilly, which sounds reasonable enough. \n\nShe's not mad cause you did something actually wrong. She's mad (or he is) that you called out behaviour that bothered you and she didn't want to hear it. If she won't talk about it, what else can you do?", "NTA.

The abuser\u2019s handbook first step is to isolate their victim - so knowing you have her back if she makes it out might help in the long term.", "NTA. You do not have to host someone who brings you anxiety and stress instead of joy. The friendship may have run its course for the time being.\n\nIt sucks that she is in an abusive relationship. However, the people in abusive relationships are the only ones that can end it and make it stay ended. Other people can't end it for them. You can still love your friend, and want her to be healthy and to have a healthy and happy relationship.\n\nBut the onus is not on you to pander to her about her relationship, nor is it your responsibility to make her break up with her asshole boyfriend.", "NTA\n\nYou should have brought it up after their last visit.   You were taken advantage of and you didn't enjoy it.   Her conflict avoidance lead to the blow up and that's her choice.", "NTA. You\u2019re not obligated to have them as guests again. Especially when they last visited they weren\u2019t good guests. Good luck to your friend, but just have to hope she comes around on her own.", "NTA. If the boyfriend is abusive and manipulative, there's nothing you can do about it. You cannot yank her out of that relationship in the hopes that she will be alright; she needs to get out for herself. Now, if that friendship doesn't feel right for you, you don't have to stay there and you don't have to host them again. If you're worried about your friend, try to communicate with her in private just to let her know that, in case SHE needs you, she can count on you, if you want to, that is.", "NTA. \nIf you have contact with her mother, I would just give the mother a heads up and ask her to contact you if they ever break up. You may be able to salvage a relationship at that point. But whilst she is refusing to leave, and refusing to engage in any kind of discussion at all, there is no hope. \n\nAnd honestly, I think it is safe to assume that whatever was texted to you was either written directly by the boyfriend or at least dictated by him. A person ego avoids conflict wouldn't have blown up like that on their own.", "YTA for responding to your emotionally abused friend\u2019s bf with a five-hour worked over tome. \n\nNot for canceling her visit, but for the rest of it yes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sometimes you just have to focus on yourself, not on others, if you feel like a \"uber\" in any type of relationship, you should probably just end it.", "NTA. Their last visit to YOUR home was uncomfortable for you. No one should feel pressured to have any guest in their space. If you explained why they weren't allowed over like in this post, I see that as perfect communication and setting a boundary on how you expect to be treated in a friendship.", "\\>  Allie hates conflict. She will avoid it at all costs. You cannot have a civil conversation with her about a dispute. She shuts down and runs away. \n\nUgh, this is dealbreaker for me with friends.  Open, honest, direct, respectful communication is super important.  NTA.  I hope she works on herself.\n\n\\>  She blew up at me and ended the friendship.\n\nWas it really a good friendship to start with?", "ESH.  She is obviously in an abusive relationship.  When he responded instead of her, you should have just said you would be willing to discuss any issues with her in the future and left it at that.  You responding to him gave him an excuse to get her to end your friendship and further isolate her.", "NTA, but this confuses me:\n\n>I said I wasn\u2019t trying to stop being friends with her, I just needed a break.\n\nIf you said that just to be gentle with her, that's fine. But if that was your actual intention- I think it was obvious that denying her and saying you need a break (even though their last visit was year ago) from your friendship was going to break it off completely.\n\nYes, it's on them, and yes, you were civil, but that's just how people react to notion you proposed.\n\nIf you were going to be honest, there were only two outcomes; either they visit, or the friendship is broken. If you wanted to preserve it somehow, an excuse of some sorts would've been the way to go.", "I did at the end. I spent a good chunk of time in an abusive relationship so I know the signs. Actually, one of the things that led me to this decision was recently before that she made some shitty comment about how she couldn\u2019t believe I stayed that long. And I was like okay cool. But after she blew up I said something along the lines of \u201cyou know I\u2019m always going to be here for you. Don\u2019t be afraid to reach out if you need something. I love you and care about you a lot and I\u2019m sorry it came to this.\u201d", "She can't be called an AH for responding to him. She's not responsible for his manipulations. \n\nPeople don't exactly have a handbook for 'How to Deal with Abusers' to refer to in these sitautions, and I don't see how her responding or not responding to him would have made any difference when isolating Allie is his overall goal no matter what.", "And what should OP have done? Donning her super-heroine cape and run to the rescue of her friend? Of what exactly would OP be rescuing her from? Is she really in an abusive relationship, or is it just that she is completely uncapable of handling conflict, as in being one of those people who will shut you down the very moment you bring up even the slightest difference with them?", "I\u2019m not sure if I exactly said break (this was a month ago). But I know I made it a point to say I didn\u2019t want to end the friendship. Because I didn\u2019t. I just didn\u2019t want to keep up this fake act that everything was okay when it wasn\u2019t.", "Gah, I\u2019m sorry - it\u2019s a sucky situation and it sounds like you did the best you could. But to quote Reddit\u2019s fav saying, \u201cdon\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep others warm.\u201d  Look after yourself x", "This. When people fall into an abusive dynamic, it is up to them to pull themselves out of that shit. If there are people around the victim trying to help them out, more often than not the results are worse for the victims themselves, since it makes it easier for the abusive to take more control, manipulate even further and isolate the victim more easily. Let's hope Allie shakes off her non-confrontational traits soon, regains some sense and runs from that relationship.", "You're NTA in either case, but it's a hard predicament if you actually wanted to preserve the friendship **without** lying or making excuses. Kinda impossible.\n\nShe has not visited in a year or has been in contact with you much, as you've stated, and when she tries to visit, you say (or imply) that you'd rather not have her do it and want to put the friendship or your interactions (that are already limited in the moment) on a break.\n\nThe message it gives off to the other person will definitely prompt them into breaking the friendship regardless of whether you're rational and civil. Even if she didn't have issues regarding her bf's manipulation or abuse, I see most people reacting in that manner.\n\nBut she's also unwilling to listen to reason or actually discuss conflict, so... yeah. She already took the most reasonable and obvious option away lol"]}
