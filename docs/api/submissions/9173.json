She's been a huge help to me in every step of planning the wedding. \n\nMarissa is in a poly relationship and she has 3 partners. Greg (24M), Brandon (27M) and Ace (22NB). She's been with Greg for 5 years and was the first partner she had. They added Brandon and Ace over the course of their relationship with Ace being the newest member. They all date each other and seem to be happy. I don't really \"get\" it if I'm being honest but it's not my business. \n\nHowever the issue came into play when Mike (32M) pulled me aside and said while he loves Marissa he didn't feel like spending the wedding explaining her love life to his family. Which I understand, they are very conservative and hardly accept LGBT people as is let alone a LGBT polyset. I had already reserved 4 spots of Marissa & co but my husband suggested he invite a few coworkers to take the partners spot and Marissa could come alone. I didn't want to ruin his big day so I agreed reluctantly. \n\nI know I should have told Marissa from the get go but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. So when invite went out she called me up immediately and asked why she didn't have a plus 3 invite. I explained to her exactly what I said above and she just said \"oh\" and hung up. \n\nNext thing I know Brandon is calling me and begging me to reconsider saying they promise they won't act like they are in a relationship but they want to be there for me. Except I can hear Greg in the background telling him tell me to fuck off and that I'm am asshole and he doesn't even want to go. I explain to Brandon that I already gave their \"spots\" to Mike's coworkers. Brandon says okay thank you and hangs up. Marissa texts me the next day saying she isn't coming unless they can go. \n\nMike said he can't uninvite his co-workers now so it's not his problem. I told him I would add them and pay the costs and he just said if I want to spend the whole time explaining their relationship to people than so be it but he isn't wasting his time doing it and will just send people my way. \n\nOur other friends think I'm an asshole but Mike's friend and a few of my non mutual friends don't think i am.

You get to plan your dream wedding with 250 guests and your dream life, and in return you do whatever his family wants, and the rest is 'not his problem'.

She\u2019s already been a huge help to you planning the wedding and yet you do this behind her back? When your husband brought it up with you that\u2019s when you should\u2019ve discussed it with her.

At the end of the day it is your wedding. But you should've spoken to your friend about it beforehand. Getting an invitation with only one name in it is not the way she should've found it. I get that you didn't want to have to face her about it but you owe it to her to do that.", "YTA already. They way you've handled this is awful and your husband sounds like an AH too.

You'll be so busy meeting and greeting everyone throughout that you won't have time to explain and simply refuse to make time to explain it to them.\n\nUnless Marissa et al are wearing big neon signs above their heads saying, we're in a poly relationship, chances are most people aren't going to take notice and if they do, so what?!", "YTA for keeping that information from Marissa.

And I certainly would never explain anything to bigots that \u201cbarely accept\u201d LGTBQ persons. They don\u2019t sound like people worth the effort.

That doesn\u2019t indicate you placing an especially high value on that friendship, at least not to anyone that isn\u2019t in your head.\n\n3 - Giving the shamefully vacated spots up to people you seem to only vaguely know by loose association, and hiding behind it as a pathetic excuse.

I have a lot of poly friends and a conservative family. There were multi-partnered people at my wedding.

I did get some post-wedding comments about folks dressed gender-non-conforming, but I told everyone to dress \u201ccolorfully\u201d so even my conservative family were in bright prints so I feel it mostly all just melded together. And, everyone had an amazing time - I heard often, from both family and friends, that it was the most fun wedding people had ever been too! And that felt sooo good actually because many people I know in alternative communities have two weddings, one for family and one for friends. I was super proud I was able to strike a balance and pull off one wedding where I truly had all the people I loved there. Where I was true to myself and we were true to who we were as a couple. I\u2019m divorced now, whoops, but my wedding was one of the best days of my life for this reason. \n\nI actually didn\u2019t do traditional plus ones for my wedding, I have a huge family and lots of friends and understand budget limitations are real (we were also around 250 - fwiw a big party is a help in no one \u201cnoticing\u201d anything) For most friends, if I\u2019m close enough with them to want them at my wedding, I also know their partner(s) and they got an individual invite.

It does sound like you know all of your friends partners on an individual basis since one called you to say he was sad he couldn\u2019t be there to support you, like these are your friends too, so you are doubly an asshole. It rude to not give plus ones to your dear friend because of the shape of her relationship when other guests get them. And it\u2019s especially rude to exclude certain friends (in favor of coworkers!) because of the shape of their relationship.

This isn't the last time your bff and Mike's parents will be the same place. \n\nI saw in another comment you want to talk to Mike's parents ahead of time. Please please ask Marissa about doing this first. She seems open, but doing that would be outing your friend. As Brandon said, they can hide they're a quad -- they no doubt have practice at this and might prefer doing that over outing themselves to 230+ strangers. If Marissa is okay with the conversation plan, she might want to game plan it with you or be there. She'll need to check with her boyfriends/partner if they're okay being outed. Etc. \n\nWhen you apologize ask Marissa what she thinks is the best way to approach it. Please. You didn't talk to her before, so talking to her preemptively now will show you're serious about being sorry.", "I had the sense that you were just talking about wedding guest behavior and I thought you were just trying to point out how others may be thinking.\n\nI just wanted to put it out there that our 21st century philosophy should be moving beyond the comfort of those who should know better.", "The way to not be an asshole is to put in the time and work to completely unlearn those prejudices, not to just accept them as part of you. It's not someone's fault if their parents taught them to be a bigot, but as an adult, they have the tools to educate themselves, examine their own prejudices, and work on eliminating those. Just because you don't say a slur out loud, doesn't mean it's okay to say in your head.", "\u201cTheir gut reaction can be ignored\u201d - No, their gut reaction can be challenged. Ignoring it means remaining an active bigot, recognising its bigotry and illogical and then doing the work of unlearning your bias is the work of a good person.", "Right. So case in point.  I'm super anti religion. In the deep,  dark recesses of my mind, nasty thoughts about religions and the people that follow them are bubbling about.  My primeval reaction is to avoid them at all costs, to be blatantly biased and to discriminate against them.  I don't want them orc their ideas near me and especially not near my kids.\n\nIt's disgusting behaviour and I'm deeply ashamed by my reaction.  Intellectually, I know I'm 100% in the wrong.  So, I actively work to push the bias down as far as I can. I stop and think before I speak. I challenge my own thinking as much as I can. I ask myself if I would react the same way to an athiest or someone less obvious in their religious observances. If the answer is no,  I need to reassess my actions. \n\nMy bias stems from some fairly traumatic events in my past,  but I don't feel it's fair to use that as an excuse.  I need to do better. \n\nSo, while I am horribly bigotted, biased and have no respect for people of faith,  I can act like a civilised and rational person in their presence.  It can be hard at times,  and sometimes the rigid control slips (don't knock on my door and tell me good loves me on a weekend) but it's mostly under control.", "The thing is, and this is coming from someone who also hates confrontation, you can't continue to cater to bigots because it will avoid arguments. You hurt your best friend by doing this. You are being silent and complacent with people that you know are *against* who your Maid of Honour is because your husband 'doesn't want to explain it to them' - something that he doesn't even *need* to do. All you two have to say to your future in-laws is 'Please, do not comment on anyone's relationship or identity at our wedding.'", "There's non-confrontational and then there's being a shitty friend.  Did avoiding having a conversation with Marissa avoid confrontation?", "I hope everything goes ok!", "OP, that seems like opening a can of worms with the parents. You can\u2019t expect them to have a bolt of understanding and acceptance.\nMyself, I\u2019d have given Marissa a \u201cplus one\u201d as with most folks\u2026 if you\u2019re now set on inviting all, I\u2019d just invite as your friends, not a poly group. \nI mean, hopefully they would be respectful during the wedding/reception? \nIf fianc\u00e9\u2019s family is as conservative as you believe, a direct discussion could lead them to pull financial support, or forbid any invitations to the poly group.", "I think we're on the same page. But if there's a lifetime of unlearning to do then a first step is better then doubling down and actively doing and saying things to hurt people who you don't understand.", "Exactly this. You can't always be perfect, but you can be good enough and that's better than being an absolute asshole.", "Being non-confrontational is more important to OP than being not-bigoted.", "I\u2019ve watched non-confrontational people torpedo their whole lives rather than deal with conflict, so this isn\u2019t a stretch. It\u2019s just sad."]}
