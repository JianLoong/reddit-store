She's been a huge help to me in every step of planning the wedding. \n\nMarissa is in a poly relationship and she has 3 partners. Greg (24M), Brandon (27M) and Ace (22NB). She's been with Greg for 5 years and was the first partner she had. They added Brandon and Ace over the course of their relationship with Ace being the newest member. They all date each other and seem to be happy. I don't really \"get\" it if I'm being honest but it's not my business. \n\nHowever the issue came into play when Mike (32M) pulled me aside and said while he loves Marissa he didn't feel like spending the wedding explaining her love life to his family. Which I understand, they are very conservative and hardly accept LGBT people as is let alone a LGBT polyset. I had already reserved 4 spots of Marissa & co but my husband suggested he invite a few coworkers to take the partners spot and Marissa could come alone. I didn't want to ruin his big day so I agreed reluctantly. \n\nI know I should have told Marissa from the get go but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. So when invite went out she called me up immediately and asked why she didn't have a plus 3 invite. I explained to her exactly what I said above and she just said \"oh\" and hung up. \n\nNext thing I know Brandon is calling me and begging me to reconsider saying they promise they won't act like they are in a relationship but they want to be there for me. Except I can hear Greg in the background telling him tell me to fuck off and that I'm am asshole and he doesn't even want to go. I explain to Brandon that I already gave their \"spots\" to Mike's coworkers. Brandon says okay thank you and hangs up. Marissa texts me the next day saying she isn't coming unless they can go. \n\nMike said he can't uninvite his co-workers now so it's not his problem. I told him I would add them and pay the costs and he just said if I want to spend the whole time explaining their relationship to people than so be it but he isn't wasting his time doing it and will just send people my way. \n\nOur other friends think I'm an asshole but Mike's friend and a few of my non mutual friends don't think i am.

You get to plan your dream wedding with 250 guests and your dream life, and in return you do whatever his family wants, and the rest is 'not his problem'.

She\u2019s already been a huge help to you planning the wedding and yet you do this behind her back? When your husband brought it up with you that\u2019s when you should\u2019ve discussed it with her. On top of that, you don\u2019t just disinvite her new partners, you go as far as to now allow her to bring anyone? \n\nAt the end of the day it\u2019s your wedding, you invite who you like, but you had plenty of opportunities along the way to not handle this like an asshole and you didn\u2019t take any of them.", "YWBTA. \nI can\u2019t even imagine how hurt your supposed best friend would be feeling right now.

I can get not wanting to have to explain why someone is there with 3 partners; personally if this person is the MOH I think that means they're important enough to you to also include their partner(s) (would you ask them to go solo if they were monogamous and gay to avoid having to explain that to conservative family?) but that's just me. At the end of the day it is your wedding. But you should've spoken to your friend about it beforehand. Getting an invitation with only one name in it is not the way she should've found it. I get that you didn't want to have to face her about it but you owe it to her to do that.", "YTA already. They way you've handled this is awful and your husband sounds like an AH too.

You'll be so busy meeting and greeting everyone throughout that you won't have time to explain and simply refuse to make time to explain it to them.\n\nUnless Marissa et al are wearing big neon signs above their heads saying, we're in a poly relationship, chances are most people aren't going to take notice and if they do, so what?!", "YTA for keeping that information from Marissa.

And I certainly would never explain anything to bigots that \u201cbarely accept\u201d LGTBQ persons. They don\u2019t sound like people worth the effort.

But don\u2019t be surprised with the outcome.", "I understand cultural differences and also believe bashing them out at a wedding is not appropriate\n\nThat said - OP, you\u2019re mainly the AH for how you and Mike went about this. You\u2019re getting married. Pretending to adult. I say pretending because - grow up. Talk to people in your lives. Tell Marissa and her partners what you have to be wary of, with Mike\u2019s family (much like you not \u201cgetting\u201d Marissa\u2019s choices, I don\u2019t \u201cget\u201d your and Mike\u2019s families either) \n\nGive them the heads up and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re not going to drop into an orgy in front of some Pearl-clutching aunts and granddads just fine for a few hours.", "Except they already told you they wouldn\u2019t act like they were in a relationship? Unless your in-laws are poling all 250 people at the wedding as to whom they\u2019re sleeping with, there\u2019s no reason they would know.", "With that many people there and if there's a bar (particularly an open bar) chances are people won't necessarily take notice.\n\nDo realize you're most likely sacrificing your friendship for your future husband (who claims to love Marissa and the group - but his love seems to have limitations) and for your bigoted future in-laws.", "Yup.\n\nI love how people on this shit hole think they\u2019re clever and funny by making this comment whenever someone calls out an OP for shit behavior", "What a weird assumption to make.", "Well I\u2019m glad having a big party is more important to you than your best friend.", "Nice job establishing early on that you are comfortable being bought out anything and anyone with money.", "You can still tell them shut the fuck up or leave once it\u2019s paid for", "I'm not saying that she should try to open their minds. Just say that they are in a relationship between four people if people ask. It might not be obvious to everyone. \n\nI couldn't care less, but I imagine that my mother and my aunt would feel confused, for example. Things change and older people might find it hard to understand it without guidance.", "So he makes everything about him and his beliefs. I personally wouldn't trust him to behave after this then.", "They told me that after I sent out the invites", "1. If it's such a bad place then why are you here?\n\n2. You're the one going around suggesting agression and vulgar language so your behavior isn't exactly great. \n\n3. If you would have read my comment you'd know that I don't condone OP's actions that much.", "Yeah except that it\u2019s not something she should be bothered with at her wedding and inevitably trying to explain it would lead to follow up questions.\n\nI\u2019m from NY so saying Fuck Off probably carries less weight to me than it does to others, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a nicer way to say it still without inviting follow up questions", "But did you ask beforehand? Or did you just make the assumption that they couldn\u2019t control themselves and disinvite all three of your maid of honor\u2019s partners behind her back?", "Why didn\u2019t you just offer Marisa a plus one? Let her choose who she wants there. And if it\u2019s not Brandon she chooses and he is someone you want there invite him separately without a plus one.\nOr even just invite Brandon as it sounds you know him best. \nMost people wouldn\u2019t expect an invite for someone  they have only been with five months and the wedding couple barely know so it should not be different just because they are poly.", "Did you even try talking to your friends or did you roll over for the bigoted family immediately?", "Hmm you\u2019re in a sticky situation indeed. But now that they\u2019ve told you they would play it on the down low and not make it obvious that they\u2019re all in a relationship, would you invite the rest of the partners?", "Because I get entertainment from peoples shit takes\nI don\u2019t give a shit about vulgar language I\u2019ll say fuck but I won\u2019t fucking rob you \nPeople who don\u2019t curse aren\u2019t trustworthy \nI don\u2019t care about your comment, you replied to mine", "That's what bothers me most, it's her best friend, why not talk to her about the feelings of the husband, all together could have found an answer. This going behind the back is the most coward and immature thing to do"]}
