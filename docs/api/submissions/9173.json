My husband, Mike and I are doing a big wedding for 250 guests. I've always dreamed of having a storybook wedding. I asked my best friend Marissa (25F) to be my MOH and she happily agreed. She's been a huge help to me in every step of planning the wedding. \n\nMarissa is in a poly relationship and she has 3 partners. Greg (24M), Brandon (27M) and Ace (22NB). She's been with Greg for 5 years and was the first partner she had. They added Brandon and Ace over the course of their relationship with Ace being the newest member. They all date each other and seem to be happy. I don't really \"get\" it if I'm being honest but it's not my business. \n\nHowever the issue came into play when Mike (32M) pulled me aside and said while he loves Marissa he didn't feel like spending the wedding explaining her love life to his family. Which I understand, they are very conservative and hardly accept LGBT people as is let alone a LGBT polyset. I had already reserved 4 spots of Marissa & co but my husband suggested he invite a few coworkers to take the partners spot and Marissa could come alone. I didn't want to ruin his big day so I agreed reluctantly. \n\nI know I should have told Marissa from the get go but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. So when invite went out she called me up immediately and asked why she didn't have a plus 3 invite. I explained to her exactly what I said above and she just said \"oh\" and hung up. \n\nNext thing I know Brandon is calling me and begging me to reconsider saying they promise they won't act like they are in a relationship but they want to be there for me. Except I can hear Greg in the background telling him tell me to fuck off and that I'm am asshole and he doesn't even want to go. I explain to Brandon that I already gave their \"spots\" to Mike's coworkers. Brandon says okay thank you and hangs up. Marissa texts me the next day saying she isn't coming unless they can go. \n\nMike said he can't uninvite his co-workers now so it's not his problem. I told him I would add them and pay the costs and he just said if I want to spend the whole time explaining their relationship to people than so be it but he isn't wasting his time doing it and will just send people my way. \n\nOur other friends think I'm an asshole but Mike's friend and a few of my non mutual friends don't think i am. Just want some more unbiased opinions.\n\nEdit: I am the asshole, that's for sure. I followed a lot of advice in this post and asked Mike what he thinks in the morning. He said to talk to Marissa first and see what she wants and we'll make it work. I also had him read over the post himself and he said that a lot of the comments opened his eyes on how he himself was coming off. So we both decided to call Marissa together and beg for forgiveness. \n\nWe called her and she was happy to talk. We explained our side of things but acknowledged that it was a massive fuck up and could have been handled so much better. We invited her and her partners, obviously and said we would be happy to whatever it takes to have them forgive us. She asked her partners about it and Brandon and Greg both agreed they would prefer to just \"split\" the set up. So Greg and Marissa would be a couple for the wedding and Brandon and Ace would be a couple. They however would need to talk to Ace first (they were at work) and that they would get back to me. So that's where we currently stand.\n\nEdit2: I never told Marissa I was inviting her partners, I just had a list of invites with Mike. I'm still the asshole but wanted to explain that.\n\nLast edit: Ace got out of work a few hours ago and we all got on speaker phone and had a long conversation with this post pulled up. The crew was all happy to be defended but did think people went a little harder than they would have even Greg. He actually laughed at me calling him self absorbed because he is lol. Anyway. We're all good :) they are coming. They gave permission to tell Mike's parents. We called them after and they understood but said don't let Nanni know or she'll be asking questions all night. It's been a huge relief and I think we learned how to communicate better as a couple.", "created_utc": 1675589314, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10u8muo/wibta_for_not_inviting_my_poly_friends_partners/", "score": 9719, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You get to plan your dream wedding with 250 guests and your dream life, and in return you do whatever his family wants, and the rest is 'not his problem'.

She\u2019s already been a huge help to you planning the wedding and yet you do this behind her back?

On top of that, you don\u2019t just disinvite her new partners, you go as far as to now allow her to bring anyone? \n\nAt the end of the day it\u2019s your wedding, you invite who you like, but you had plenty of opportunities along the way to not handle this like an asshole and you didn\u2019t take any of them.", "YWBTA. \nI can\u2019t even imagine how hurt your supposed best friend would be feeling right now.

I can get not wanting to have to explain why someone is there with 3 partners; personally if this person is the MOH I think that means they're important enough to you to also include their partner(s) (would you ask them to go solo if they were monogamous and gay to avoid having to explain that to conservative family?) but that's just me. At the end of the day it is your wedding. But you should've spoken to your friend about it beforehand. Getting an invitation with only one name in it is not the way she should've found it. I get that you didn't want to have to face her about it but you owe it to her to do that.", "YTA already. They way you've handled this is awful and your husband sounds like an AH too.

You'll be so busy meeting and greeting everyone throughout that you won't have time to explain and simply refuse to make time to explain it to them.\n\nUnless Marissa et al are wearing big neon signs above their heads saying, we're in a poly relationship, chances are most people aren't going to take notice and if they do, so what?!", "YTA for keeping that information from Marissa.

It\u2019s only because polyamory is outside what many people consider the norm, that people are saying otherwise. \n\nI am not polyamorous or anything but it\u2019s not my job to police people\u2019s relationships, explain them, or dictate what makes an \u201cacceptable\u201d relationship. And I certainly would never explain anything to bigots that \u201cbarely accept\u201d LGTBQ persons. They don\u2019t sound like people worth the effort.

After the wedding he will trash her to you because she was upset.\n\nYou have a few choices. \n\n1. Let this bigot win, lose your friends forever, and be \u201chappily\u201d married.\n2. Set him straight now. You may have already lost these friends. It may be possible to save the friendship but it will take some SERIOUS apologies and making the situation right.\n3. Stop or postpone the wedding.\n\nThese are all your choices, now. You cannot sit back and now say, well, he wouldn\u2019t let me\u2026\n\nETA: YTA for how it has been handled thus far, you can change that depending upon how you move forward.", "YTA and your husband is an AH.

That is never acceptable.\n\n2 - Not having the simple, common decency to admit to your BEST FRIEND what you were going to do, until they learned from the invites. That doesn\u2019t indicate you placing an especially high value on that friendship, at least not to anyone that isn\u2019t in your head.\n\n3 - Giving the shamefully vacated spots up to people you seem to only vaguely know by loose association, and hiding behind it as a pathetic excuse. That, right there, is a situation that Mike has had a direct hand in creating. Why the actual f*** is that no longer his problem!? His co-workers, at his suggestion, going to his wedding.

I have a lot of poly friends and a conservative family. There were multi-partnered people at my wedding. I gave a LOT of thought to the seating chart, seated my most conservative family far from tables where they might overhear things I didn\u2019t want them too, seated \u201cnormal\u201d friends and less conservative family as buffers, but no one asked me questions or noticed anything, far as I know. I did get some post-wedding comments about folks dressed gender-non-conforming, but I told everyone to dress \u201ccolorfully\u201d so even my conservative family were in bright prints so I feel it mostly all just melded together. And, everyone had an amazing time - I heard often, from both family and friends, that it was the most fun wedding people had ever been too! And that felt sooo good actually because many people I know in alternative communities have two weddings, one for family and one for friends. I was super proud I was able to strike a balance and pull off one wedding where I truly had all the people I loved there. Where I was true to myself and we were true to who we were as a couple. I\u2019m divorced now, whoops, but my wedding was one of the best days of my life for this reason. \n\nI actually didn\u2019t do traditional plus ones for my wedding, I have a huge family and lots of friends and understand budget limitations are real (we were also around 250 - fwiw a big party is a help in no one \u201cnoticing\u201d anything) For most friends, if I\u2019m close enough with them to want them at my wedding, I also know their partner(s) and they got an individual invite.

It does sound like you know all of your friends partners on an individual basis since one called you to say he was sad he couldn\u2019t be there to support you, like these are your friends too, so you are doubly an asshole. It rude to not give plus ones to your dear friend because of the shape of her relationship when other guests get them. And it\u2019s especially rude to exclude certain friends (in favor of coworkers!) because of the shape of their relationship.

Despite all of the shame you and mike have put on them he still wants to be there for his friend  on her special day.   \n\n\n**\u201cExcept I can hear Greg in the background telling him tell me to fuck off and that I'm am asshole and he doesn't even want to go.\u201d** I can\u2018t blame him to be honest.

Please please ask Marissa about doing this first. She seems open, but doing that would be outing your friend. As Brandon said, they can hide they're a quad -- they no doubt have practice at this and might prefer doing that over outing themselves to 230+ strangers. If Marissa is okay with the conversation plan, she might want to game plan it with you or be there. She'll need to check with her boyfriends/partner if they're okay being outed.

There's all your problems solved.", "I suggest you, Marissa, Greg, Ace, and Brandon get together and talk about this. It seems to me that you are in a tough spot that has led you to possibly really hurt your best friend and her partners. A heartfelt apology for allowing them to be marginalized by Mike due to his family\u2019s nonacceptance might help your relationships with them heal. As you probably are aware, LGBTQ community members endure a lifetime of being hidden and denigrated. I can imagine that this might feel to them as though they are being excluded yet again for their sexuality, and by a best friend to one of them. I am also concerned for you by this sentence: \u201cMike said he can't uninvite his co-workers now so it's not his problem.\u201d He co-created a situation with you that has the potential to damage one of your most important relationships. Does he often respond so seemingly callously and self-centeredly to your pain and/or fear? Your relationship with him as your partner may not be the soft place to fall that you need when you hit one of life\u2019s many difficult moments, if that is his frequent response. I recommend that you reflect on that question and, if the answer is that his pattern of responding in the past is consistent with this situation, you at least talk about that with him. Additionally, I recommend some premarital couples counseling, if you haven\u2019t done it yet. His family\u2019s culture infused his upbringing, and I suspect this is not the first nor the last time his family\u2019s world view from that culture will intrude and influence his reactions, expectations, and perspective. You may struggle with setting boundaries, as you say you are non-confrontational. You may over time find yourself living in a very constricted space in your own life if you and he don\u2019t form a pact about setting boundaries around your relationship, develop a shared vision about your future together, and you don\u2019t develop the ability to set limits with others.", "YTA. You and your husband-to-be are telling Marissa that you judge her. I'm actually surprised that you're close enough to have Marissa in your wedding party, and yet you don't count all 3 of her partners as friends.

But you seem to feel perfectly fine excluding them, which means Marissa is a good enough friend to slave away, making your wedding experience beautiful and lovely, but you haven't made the time or effort to get to know her significant others in the last *5 years*. What a low blow to Marissa and her partners to know that you're so dismissive of all of them. If I were them, I wouldn't be interested in coming to your wedding at this point.

By the time I met D, he was a transvestite (self-identified). It wasn't a problem for me. D dressed conservative and he liked sensible pumps more than I did, but he was also a lovely conversationalist and a caring soul. Now my Daddy, born in 1933, had been a fundamentalist Christian since high school, and he used to feel justified in telling people they were going to hell. Daddy was just a few years removed from that mindset at the time of my party. So I was in pure shock when I saw Daddy and D sitting next to each other, deep in discussion about military matters. Daddy had been in the Navy during the Korean War and we lived in a town with a Navy base, do the topic made sense. Everybody had a great time and went on about life. Then we got pictures printed from the party, and there were several pictures of Daddy and D talking. My sister *bless her heart* said, \"oh, is that Daddy talking to your man friend in a dress?\" [Strong eye roll] And I guessed this might be a moment for lots more nasty little comments about D, but Daddy grabbed the picture and just stared. Finally he said, \"that was a man?\" OH. EM. GEE. They talked about D's time on a ship when a woman would not have been allowed, but it flew right by Daddy. But he had nothing negative to say. He just said, \"well I'll be!\" and went back to watching TV.\n\nMoral of the story: my Dad saw D as he expected to him to be. He was in a different environment than usual with lots of activity and he just didn't click with the reality of D. He actually told me later that he enjoyed talking to D. Also, if Daddy had realized that D was a man while at the party, my Daddy would not have made a scene because of it.\n\nAs for OP, if your fiance doesn't want to \"explain\" Marissa's poly set to his family, it seems most likely that your fiance also has a problem with it.

Ability to cater clearly isn\u2019t a problem. Even if it were, she still should have communicated with her MOH. To not talk to her, and not even give her a +1, where everyone else likely did get one(admittedly an assumption, but based on the size of the wedding and the fact we\u2019re talking about someone in the bridal party, and the MOH at that!) is a further snub. \n\nEven if the catering was an issue, the MOH should have been able to pick between getting a plus one or going by herself if she didn\u2019t want to choose a partner. So, communication was required regardless.", "She\u2019s the maid of honour", "People with kids?", "Who cares?

Same should apply here.", "I kinda agree and disagree at same time. I agree that she\u2019s justified in not wanting to invite all three but I think the AH move was that she blindsided her best friend with this decision. Had she been more upfront maybe they could have found a compromise together like just pick one partner to bring because I agree that expecting to bring all three lovers to every event is a bit entitled especially if the host isn\u2019t close to all three of your lovers", "I would normally agree with this accept that she led Marissa to believe all 3 would be invited. She even had a table for the four of them planned. It also seems like she\u2019s friends with all four of them because even Marissa\u2019s partners wanted to come support her. It\u2019s more than just wanting a plus 3 and not getting it. It\u2019s being rejected by someone you thought was your friend because they decided to prioritize bigots instead of supportive friends.", "Why would they have to explain a poly relationship to anybody?

There\u2019s no hierarchy to our family and no casual partners.\n\nOn the other hand, some poly people have longterm primary partners and date around otherwise or have semi-serious but entirely separate second relationships - in that case it may be totally fine to only invite the one partner (esp if they only live with one of them, or they have kids with one and don\u2019t co-parent w/ the others, for example). One of my best friends has a wife she\u2019s been with for like 15 years and a girlfriend she\u2019s been with for 1.5 but who has never met her wife or family. That friend would never expect girlfriend to be invited to the same events she and her wife would attend together.\n\nThe rules are, I\u2019d say, similar to the usual ones but scaled to include more people. I think MOST people would include +1s for married adults or couples in long term relationships (timelines might vary person to person but things like dating for one or two years or living together are big markers some people use).

The holier-than-thou people. \n\nThe first comment said it well, inform the bigots that they will be thrown out if they publicly point and shame.", "> Honestly, at a 250 person wedding, how would his family even notice a poly relationship?\n\nBecause assholes like that are looking for things to be offended by.", "Not to defend the OP/future-husband/in-laws, because I do think how this was handled with first saying yes to 3 guests, then taking it away, now considering adding them back, is fucked up. And she is the AH for that. He\u2019s an asshole for worrying about this, and I don\u2019t really know if the family cares or not, but assuming they do, they suck too. So ESH.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s the MOH\u2026. People might notice. Someone like the MOH having 3 guests is very atypical, unless it\u2019s something where the families are close. This talk that conservatives won\u2019t notice, apparently because they don\u2019t have \u201cgaydar\u201d or something, is also BS. Believe me, conservatives have their hackles up over all kinds of stuff like this now. They very well could notice.", "That kind of news will spread like wildfire think about it.  250 people in a contained room where the MOH is at the wedding with her LGBTQ+ poly SO. It\u2019s going to make the rounds. I don\u2019t blame the groom for not wanting to deal with explaining it to his family.\nThe bride is AH in this case because  she didn\u2019t tell her friend before the invites went out, she owed her friend that much", "I agree with the part about how it\u2019s a large wedding so \u201cbeing forced\u201d to explain the relationship constantly is not an issue. In addition, you could easily tell your family members to ask Marissa about her own relationships it\u2019s isn\u2019t your responsibility to explain that to family. Mike\u2019s worry about this is really dumb. Mike is also a dick for saying that he should invite coworkers and have her come alone. I don\u2019t understand how people are so beholden and afraid of their own family. If they don\u2019t accept it, it\u2019s on them. A wedding isn\u2019t for random family it\u2019s for the bride and groom.\n\nThe issue is giving Marissa not any plus one at all. However, her being annoyed or pissed that she didn\u2019t get a +3 is absolutely ridiculous. Is OP good friends or even have any sort of relationship with every member of the couple? Is this Quadruple in a serious relationship? If it\u2019s just them fucking, having the expectation that they were all just going to get an invite to the wedding is pretty cavalier thinking.", "Exactly this is a huge wedding. If it was a small intimate wedding and she wasn\u2019t a member of the wedding party (Maid of HONOR even!) and the couple didn\u2019t necessarily personally know the partners well it might be reasonable to say giving one person three plus ones is a little unfair especially if other guests might not even be getting one. But context and intentions matter and that\u2019s why YTA", "I'm looking forward to it and if you're in Iowa next summer (not where I live but where the party will be) we're pretty chill with party crashers assuming they're willing to look awesome and be cool \ud83e\udd23", "2023 or 2024? It could work...always cool plus awesome!", ">The \u201cI did a thing that affects you, but it\u2019s done, so now it\u2019s not my problem\u201d response cements that Mike is an AH, and there\u2019s an underlying problem here in the relationship.\n\nTBF, OP did agree to invite 3 of mikes coworkers instead and Mike doesn't want to invite her MOH poly partners anyways.   His solution was to invite 3 of his  co-workers.  Of course its not his problem anymore. He got his way.\n\nOP is in a difficult spot because  she knew her MOH was poly (and even in OP post) it doesn't  look like that she's very much in agreement with it in the first place. She takes its not my business.\n\nAlso OP created this problem for herself the easiest way for her to have solved this was a plus one.    Every guest gets to bring one person because I'm sure other people would have been upset that MOH got to bring three while they can only bring one. but whatever.", "\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97"]}
