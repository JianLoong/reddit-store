There's something going on here; is she into your boyfriend? She can't be so stupid as to not understand what a couple is. Let her refuse to talk to you.

In that I can\u2019t possibly understand what your friend is thinking. The silent treatment? Withholding? I think we know who the toxic one is and it\u2019s not you. NTA.", "Uh. Your friend has some issues. Also. possibly has a crush on you(or the boyfriend). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA.", "No you're NTA, but your friend is really weird if she thinks it's okay to be a third wheel on what is supposed to be a date. There's something deeper here that you need to dig into. No idea what it could be, I don't want to speculate. But it's definitely odd that she expects to be invited on a couple's date", "Nta! She is the toxic one to want to spend all of the time that someones boyfriend comes back home with the bf. How is you going on a date toxic? Don't apologize and (sadly) reconsider the friendship if she doesn't accept that.", "NTA why does she not understand that you want to have a private date with your bf. \nIs she jealous? I would ask how she would like it if you went on her date with her bf.\nWhat does your bf think about it?  \nDid you tell her sorry but this is not a friend's date but a boyfriend/ girlfriend date so only 2 people. We are not in a relationship with you so we will spend time with you later.\nPersonally I would have spent time with her at all when your bf is over because that's your guys time. \nYou can eat together etc but further it would be me and my bf", "NTA\n\nAsk her why she was trying to clam dam you.", "NTA.  She\u2019s delusional and quite frankly in her shoes I wouldn\u2019t have objected if you\u2019d spent the entire weekend with just him.  She has no claim on your time or your boyfriend\u2019s time, and honestly it\u2019s very weird that she expected you both to spend the whole weekend with her.", "NTA\n\nThere's something fishy here.  Don't invite her at all when you're with your BF in the future.", "NTA. Your friend needs to understand boundaries.", "NTA - either she's incredibly clingy and needy and can't understand a scenario where she's not involved. OR she's into your boyfriend and she really wants to spend time with him like she has a crush on him. OR she has some issues where she cannot pick up on very clear social signals where she shouldn't insist on being the 3rd wheel on a date.", "NTA, perfectly acceptable to want time with your bf as a couple. Your flatmates reaction to this is very odd and makes me think something else is going on (with her, not him). I don't think you owe her an apology. I would definitely be cautious about including her in anything else.", "Nta\n\nShe sounds clingy af, or maybe has a crush on your boyfriend and is jealous.", "NTA but sounds like she wants to be more than friends with him.", "If she brings it up again send her the definition of the word date. She\u2019s not really a friend if she thinks you should spend your \u201cdate\u201d time with her as a friend thing!!

There is a difference between friends and boyfriend/girlfriend. I am sure that there was a lot of PDA and it would at been weird to have someone watching you, and you just wanted to concentrate on each other. In any case, she spent the rest of the weekend with her, so her saying she was being excluded is wrong. Has she never been in a relationship to not understand this or as she got a crush on either of you?", "NTA and that friend is creepy. Cut her loose.", "NTA. You friend is either very childish, into your boyfriend, into you, or has some fantasy of getting together with you as a couple.", "NTA, your friend is being intrusive.", "NTA. Don't be friends with her anymore and then it won't be a friend outing anymore since you won't be friends.", "This exactly.", "I'm sorry but I've never heard clam dam before and I just want to say thank you because it is HILARIOUS", "Maybe she's the fabled self-hunting unicorn.", "NTA, and your friend legit sounds creepy (like, Single White Female vibes).  Time to go low contact or no contact with her from this point forward.", "NTA - your friend has a thing for your bf", "NTA, tell your friend he's your boyfriend not hers! Also red flags make sure your not getting played by them please.", "This girl is either into you or your bf lol either way she\u2019s being a big ol weirdo about it. NTA but your \u201cfriend\u201d is off putting.", "NTA.  Who invites themselves on another couple's date?  Unless maybe she was hoping for a threesome.", "Info: How long has your friend wanted your man?", "What does she mean by \"part of the group friend\" you are not a group, you're a couple and she is an extra. WTH!?", "Dude, your friend sounds like she wants to either be your third or just come between you two a bit.  NTA, but you might want to find out what her issue is because if she really believes she's entitled more to your boyfriend than you there is a problem.", "NTA. No, that's not how dates work.", "NTA - She has a crush on either you, or your BF.\n\nIt is neither normal nor sane to try and invade someone else's date or private time. Usually we hear about this type of stuff from jealous ex's or overbearingly enmeshed MIL's. From a friend??? HAHAHA Nopes. Ulterior motives galore.\n\nI would seriously put space between her and your life. Start gray-rocking, not giving her info, not talking to her about your relationship or your life at all. Keep it to discussing the weather or a random celebrity til she goes away.", "I was thinking the same thing. There's no reasonable explanation for her wanting to be a third wheel unless she has a thing for the boyfriend. Edit to add NTA", "oh, i should've specify that one in the post, i really think that's not the case as she's not into guys and has a gf", "Same, this one is going in the mental box of \"terms I really, really hope that I get a chance to use soon\".", "So maybe the question should be \"how long has your friend wanted you\"", "NTA - did she want to be included when you and your boyfriend had sex too?", "I don't really know why she's a part of any of your day with your long distance BF.\n\nHonestly, I've done long distance before, and if I was visiting and my partner insisted her friend joins along for any part of the day I'd be pissed.\n\nNTA, but you have to really lay down some boundaries with this weird friend.", "INFO I'm confused why you are even asking.", "Someone has a crush on your boyfriend", "NTA she is either jealous and has a crush on your bf, or wanted your bf to pay for her to do whatever fun activities you had planned.", "You\u2019re NTA but this is not a normal response from your friend. No one expects to be a third wheel on someone else\u2019s date. She\u2019s either into you or your bf and didn\u2019t want you to be alone.", "She wants your man. NTA.", "Time to put some distance between you and this \"friend.\"", "NTA", "Clam dam? What is this?", "I've heard Clam Jam, but i think i like this one better", "Bingo", "NTA, now is the time to start setting those boundaries. Take it from someone whose had a friend ruin her relationship, and it started like this. Her wanting to spend time with us, her wanting to be in between us, then boom, we were all over.", "NTA. Who would want to be the 3rd wheel on couple's date?  Sounds like she has a thing for your bf.  To call you toxic for not inviting her on your date is rather troubling.  I don't know what she's thinking but something isn't adding up.  My guess is it's just jealousy.  \n\nYou have nothing to apologize for.  If she won't let it go, then you probably need to find a new roommate or place to live.", "YIKES. There's definitely some bigger issue here with your friend. Absolutely do not apologize to her, you'd be validating and encouraging the behaviour. NTA.", "she was mad you didn't invite her on your DATE?!!  WTF is wrong with her?  NTA, NTA, NTA.", "Or she has a thing for OP. If she is there the whole time then bf and OP can't make the beast with two backs, and then he leaves and she has OP all to herself.", "It's like a cock block,  but with clams instead.", "I'm guessing it's like blue-balling and will use it from now on lmao", "NTA. Did I read this right?\nYour friend is angry and calling you toxic because she wasn't invited along on your date with your boyfriend?\nShe's the toxic one. And seriously deluded. Also sounds like she has a crush on him.", "NTA\n\nThat's clingy af. He's your boyfriend and you absolutely deserve to spend one on one time with him", "NTA\n\nHer issue isn\u2019t that she simply wasn\u2019t invited, her issue is either:\n\n1. She is into your boyfriend and is jealous to not be with him also. - OR - 2. She is that type of jealous possesive friend that don\u2019t want you to do things without her.\n\nThose are the posibilities and both options are red flag that you don\u2019t need in a friend. I think you need to re-think that friendship because something is wrong when she feels entitled to time that isn\u2019t hers.", "nah it\u2019s like cock blocking but ya know clams", "Lmao yes, you're right, I got those two mixed up"]}
