Then you call the police on child abandonment and say you need to leave, would they please send someone.  When the cops get there answer their questions and leave.  Bingo bongo done.", "You stay til the cops arrive, the issue is your sister would have just left them without ensuring she had a babysitter, which counts as abandonment. Just because there is another adult in the house doesnt mean her kids are supervised or safe.", "And I mean, she\u2019d leave for other things besides work and she\u2019d also come home waaaaaay after she\u2019d get off work.", "NTA\nPeople like your sister are so awful I\u2019m so sorry OP", "NTA and refuse from now on.", "NTA", "NTA, where is the children's father? Or, am I correct in saying 'fathers'? Sounds like it might be father's, plural. \n\nWhy are you worried about being shamed when your sister seems to be living a lifestyle much more worthy of shame than yours.", "NTA\n\nStart making yourself less available. Get up early and go to the library. Make your appointments for just before the times she usually leaves her children with you. Enroll in a class - a trade, academic, or just for fun. Hang out with friends. Whatever gets you out of the house and from under her and your mother's thumbs.\n\nMove out as soon as you can. \n\nDon't let them make you feel guilty. Remember this: When you were a child, your parents were responsible for you. That was their job and you owe them nothing for raising you, no matter what anyone else may tell you. If your mother and siblings don't like it that you're telling her no, invite them to tell her yes and babysit, in your stead.", "NTA", "Your family abused you. It's called parentification.", "Stop making excuses for your sister. Several people have told you what to do. Tell her you are calling the police for child abandonment within (time period) if she doesn't return and THEN DO IT. She is the one in the wrong, not you. You didn't have these kids, she did. \n\nShe will continue to walk all over you and by doing NOTHING, YOU ARE LETTING HER. NTA", "Don't let yourself be a victim here. You have options. You might not like those options, but you need to know that it is up to you to draw the hard line and then enforce and reinforce your boundaries. She's not going to just start respecting your autonomy because you wish her to.\n\nIf she keeps dumping the kids with you without your agreeing to watch them, then she's forcing your hand. Call the police. Call CPS. Take them to a relative's house. Find out exactly where she is and return them to her...even if she's at a club or on a date...etc.", "This is what you do. Announce that you are no longer a free baby sitter and you have given up enough of your life for her bad choices. If anybody in your family objects and tries to shame tell them so you volunteer? Great. Also let your family know she drops them off unexpectedly with out asking, and if she does it again you are calling CPS. I want you to understand that this is actually for the best because she is irresponsible and needs to change her behavior for her kids sake.", "You wouldn't  get a criminal record - she would. All you have to do is call the police on her for child abandonment. Yes, leaving them with someone who  did not agree to watch them does count as child abandonment. Being in the house when she leaves does not count as agreement.", "OP keeps responding with if I don't take care of them I am neglecting the kids like my sister, don't understand why she is on this post. Good on you to tell her like it is, she will be raising the kids. Oh well, that's on her.", "Not only that, but what kind of childcare are OP and sister's parents offering? Because it sounds like OP does the lion's share and always has. I'm with others who say sister needs to be told \"next time you leave them for me to watch without asking AND me agreeing, I'm calling the cops\". Make sure their parents know as well. If they're so worried about it, THEY can watch their grandkids or pay for childcare.\n\nNTA.", "But you are not enforcing it. Unless you are enforcing a boundary it is meaningless to people who want to ignore ot", "Those are words. What you need are actions.", "It's less likely you will be, you aren't their legal guardian. I want you to think about her doing this and then texting you that \"Littles are downstairs I left\" and you having to text back \"WTF I'M AN HOUR AWAY AND THEY ARE ALONE!\" Because she didn't check anyone would be there hoping she had you trapped at home but didn't realize you had already left for the day. If you don't report it, the likelihood of this happening rises every so slightly every day", "Soo dont leave. Just call the police. Dont let her take advantage of u", "One day sis will do this and text op that she did it, only to get the reply \"no one is home, wtf?!\"", "NTA- I would just say it's a blanket no from now on, otherwise she'll just ramp up the lies and excuses to make you look like more TA when you say no. She'll have friends with medical emergencies coming out of her ears. Then she'll have to see a doctor about her earache.", "NTA!", "NTA", "YTA in this particular instance because it sounds like you were manipulating her for an ice cream and were only pretending to respect her boundaries.\n\nWhy are you watching her kids at all? You can visit and be fun aunt (if you choose because you love the kids) without babysitting. Give your sister a hard, irrevocable \u201cno\u201d.", "oh noes I won't be allowed to provide free babysitting to my sister anymore", "Can you leave before she does? Just read somewhere quiet, take a walk in the park, go to the gym. Do anything to be out of the house before her.\n\nAlternatively you can just drop off the kid at her work before your shift.", "You will not get charged with her\u2026 those are not your kids", "No, you would not be a hypocrite. You are not their mom. Get those thoughts out of your head.\n\nYou don't have to call the cops. Call CPS. If she gets a case opened on her, at least it will make it more difficult for her to ever take a job involving caring for children.", ">I understand I didn't have them, they aren't my responsibility, but the minute I live the house I too can be arrested for child neglect because I knew no one was in the house. I wouldn't even forgive myself if something was to happen. They aren't even old enough to fend for themselves.\n\nNow you need to leave the house before she does, so she doesn't force it on you."]}
