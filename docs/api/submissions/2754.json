Yeah, using the ice cream situation as a way to segue into the real conflict is a little petty, but it worked.  Your sister wants free childcare, you should not be the person required to provide it.  The fact that you gave her the option to still ask after seven years of being forced into it speaks to your character.  And yeah, do not get an apartment with her.

You shouldn't have to look after them unless you agree to do so. \n\nEdit: Obviously there are sometimes exceptions to this rule, but your sister is just using you.", "NTA.  I imagine the ice cream was the breaking point.  Your parents are awful for allowing her to do this as well.  I would stop watching them, those kids are her job to manage.", "NTA.

Especially when you're younger, you really do not have much of a choice.\n\nYour sister needs a wake-up call on so many levels. She's 29 with four kids, she took that responsibility on herself. She should not be solely relying on you, her much younger brother, to help manage her life affairs.\n\nEspecially since now you're finally able to commit to your own decisions.\n\nI think she needs to be reminded that you've grown up and are no longer a kid with no responsibilities. You have your own now, and she needs to stop using you as a crutch and find a more sustainable course of action.\n\nNot to say that, like, you should never watch her kids.

Her for being an irresponsible mother who has children she can't and won't take care of.  You for enabling her all this time.", "It is child abandonment. But imagine me actually doing that. I would literally be shamed by my whole family", "It was a little petty, as well as a good analogy about boundaries. She doesn't respect it. I try to be understanding of her situation, but to not have the decency to ask someone if they can watch your kids, so you can go to work would have been okay. But straight up abandoning them isn't okay with me. I get so upset because what if she done that and someone happened to them. She would hold me responsible because she expects me to watch them, but really she's the one who doesn't make sure someone is in the house before she leaves.", "Yeah, I was very naive to it, until I started getting older and seeing what she was doing. Taking advantage of your younger siblings and expecting them to watch your kids without asking them. I was most definitely being used", "It was pretty crazy for the Ice Cream being the breaking point, but it was a pretty good analogy.", "Hey, when I said forced, I mean she left the house without asking me. She actually never asked me to watch them. She expected me to watch them because we're family.

If I stated I was a child being forced. How is that me enabling her all this time?", "Why? I'm not approving the sisters behavior, I'm not saying that her sister isn't taking advantage of her, but it's not like there's any legal obligation to repay that debt. And if she doesn't want to babysit her sister's kids, then she just shouldn't babysit them instead of doing it and then complaining about it.", "That person doesn't really understand how controlling families can be, especially to teenagers.

And is your sister getting pregnant by the same man? I'm not judging.im just seeing something hinky.", "So do you suggest OP just leave the kids alone once she realizes her sister is gone and has left the kids again? \nAlso, she never said she\u2019s owed ice cream because she babysat the kids. She stated her sister has no problem forcing her to watch her kids by just leaving and not having enough consideration to ASK. But when OP has the consideration of asking instead of just taking, her sister just acts stingy about it.", "Also, what boundary did she not set? Having your younger sibling watch your kids whenever you feel like it\u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to set a boundary for any parent to know that\u2019s irresponsible and neglectful af. If the sister always asked and OP always said yes, you\u2019d have a good point. But that\u2019s not the case here.", "What's even crazier is, I was never asked to watch them.  She just left without saying anything.", "\"Was\" is past tense btw. How can I say no, if she never ask and just leaves the house. And, yes, I brought it to her attention to stop doing that, but, she doesn't respect anyone's boundaries.", "My parents are oldheads and think I should watch her kids just because she's my sister, but by force I mean she literally leaves the house without saying anything and I'm stuck watching her kids. And nope not by the same guy ... If I were to leave the house I would get in trouble for leaving her kids by themselves, but isn't that's what she's doing if she's not notifying someone that she's leaving ?", "Yes, I suggest she tells her sister \"from now on I'm not babysitting again and the next time you leave your kids alone without a sitter I'm calling CPS\", and the sister has the right to be stingy. Is the sister an asshole for it? Obviously, but it is her ice cream and she's allowed to say no."]}
