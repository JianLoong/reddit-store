My husband and I always help each other remember. Not only that but we always ensure the closer one sends a message or calls first. For example, if it is my Dad\u2019s birthday, he won\u2019t send a message until after I have wished my Dad a Happy Birthday. I do the same for his parents. Marriage is a partnership and I love that we do little things to make it easier on each other.", "NTA\n\nHe presumably has a phone with a calendar app, a laptop or tablet with a calendar app, or even an ancient wall-hanging calendar, correct?

These comments are weird. Question for you\u2014 has anyone ever said \u201chave you wished x a happy birthday\u201d to you? It\u2019s quite literally that simple.

He\u2019s definitely right that in a partnership you should be helping each other out. Just imagine the scenario was flipped\u2014 how would you feel if he said HBD to your mom when you forgot all about it? You\u2019d probably feel super guilty and dumb and I\u2019m sure you\u2019d wish he reminded you. If you can empathize with him then you can admit you should\u2019ve said something.

Like, useful as hell but also real fucking creepy.\n\nI googled the address of a place I hadn't been to in a while and there was a little note \"you were last here October 2019\". WEIRD BUT OKAY.", "I hear you! I just wanted to amplify your comment and give another option as well. \u263a\ufe0f there are so many to choose from, this guy has absolutely no excuse.", "JUST WAKE ME UP WHEN YOU GET UP omggggg if I had a dollar for every time my ex requested this then didn\u2019t get up then blamed ME because HE didn\u2019t get up. I swear \ud83d\ude24", "I guess you never forgot a birthday, me, a female, can attest that sometimes I don't remember every birthday and my so also doesn't, so we remind each other. Forgetting almost never happens, but in the case we do, we just remind each other of it. It's not a job. Sometimes we forget to tell each other, but both remember, it's not a rule, and it's not a burden either. It's just how it happens. It's something you talk about when you spend your time eating together or doing other stuff. \n\nYou're sexist by assuming it's always the man who forgets and that it was the gender I was referring to. \n\nAnd nice touch, first you talk about how we're talking about a situation that's not applicable to this post, but at the end go back to it just to make a point that it's not even relevant to out conversation.", "No I'm not. You can read my last reply to understand what I meant.", "For me it's not. Me and my so try to remind ourselves, it's not a burden and we're living happily and we're not managing each other. \n\nI guess you have to accept that there are people who live differently, like me and my family. \n\nHave a nice day !", "Yeah the \"I ordered flowers for your wife, it's her birthday\" is full on toxic secretary stuff. Along with picking up your bosses drycleaning.", "IKR?. It sounds like he wanted her to make a special communication to him to remind him. I would find it so insulting if someone did that to me.", "Link?? Totally missed that one", "Many many people unintentionally and intentionally trade privacy or convenience.\n\nCompanies often make turning off such features a pain or make it brick the app. Overall, I would say it is getting better, and people are becoming more educated about it, but we still have a long way to go.", "It\u2019s great that you and your SO both/each remember things like birthdays, and you haven\u2019t found yourself in the trap of being held responsible for remembering things like birthdays. \n\nI, and probably many other here, have. The fact that OP\u2019s BF immediately became verbally aggressive with her because she didn\u2019t remind him is a huge \ud83d\udea9 that she should not ignore.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137z1vl/aita_for_not_paying_my_boyfriend_back_after_he/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nIt\u2019s interesting how this couple has been together 10 months too. There have been a few of these lately. I guess that\u2019s when the AH starts coming out in some relationships. They can only fake it so long", "Yeah, it's the aggressiveness that takes this out of the 'its nice to work together\" scenario.  Sure, people forget.  It happens.  But the one who forgets shouldn't blow up at the one who doesn't.", "What trap ?! What assumptions are you making about my life ? Held responsible? A couple relationship is not a job, please move on if you got nothing better to do besides critiquing me.", "Exactly. I admit this post has triggered me regarding my former marriage, but I really wish I had paid close attention to these sort of \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Did you not read OP\u2019s post? Her BF blew up at her because she didn\u2019t remind him of his own mother\u2019s birthday. It became OP\u2019s fault that BF didn\u2019t remember and call his mother. TRAP! HELD RESPONSIBLE!\n\nIt\u2019s great that you seem to have an incredible and equal partnership. But maybe you don\u2019t since you just commented that I\u2019m making assumptions about your relationship. \n\nHowever, many don\u2019t have great and equal partnerships. Many of us have read this post and noticed the \ud83d\udea9 concerning the BF. It\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t remember his mom\u2019s birthday. It\u2019s that he immediately \u201cblew up\u201d at OP for his failure. Today, it\u2019s his mom\u2019s birthday. Tomorrow, it will be something else."]}
