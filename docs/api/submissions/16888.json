My husband and I always help each other remember. Not only that but we always ensure the closer one sends a message or calls first. For example, if it is my Dad\u2019s birthday, he won\u2019t send a message until after I have wished my Dad a Happy Birthday. I do the same for his parents. Marriage is a partnership and I love that we do little things to make it easier on each other.", "NTA\n\nHe presumably has a phone with a calendar app, a laptop or tablet with a calendar app, or even an ancient wall-hanging calendar, correct? His reaction was overblown. That said, I\u2019m sort of surprised at the responses that it\u2019s not your job to remember; while that\u2019s true, don\u2019t couples help each other out sometimes?

But you didn't even casually say you called and spoke to his mother on her birthday? That seems like something that would at least have come up in conversation that day.", "Yeah yta lol this isn\u2019t a feminist thing either. These comments are weird. Question for you\u2014 has anyone ever said \u201chave you wished x a happy birthday\u201d to you? It\u2019s quite literally that simple. I mean, asshole is harsh cuz it\u2019s not like it\u2019s your obligation to make sure he\u2019s aware of all his friends/family\u2019s birthdays but also it\u2019s so easy to shoot that text and make sure your man isn\u2019t making an ass out of himself. He\u2019s definitely right that in a partnership you should be helping each other out. Just imagine the scenario was flipped\u2014 how would you feel if he said HBD to your mom when you forgot all about it? You\u2019d probably feel super guilty and dumb and I\u2019m sure you\u2019d wish he reminded you. If you can empathize with him then you can admit you should\u2019ve said something. Again, not a big AHole, but his feelings aren\u2019t some deep seeded misogyny, it\u2019s just genuine hurt for a number of reasons, and a simple apology can go a long way here.", "INFO: did you KNOW he didn\u2019t remember?", "YTA. No one said you had to be a secretary, but are you really saying that you don't have to remind him of anything at all? It sometimes slips people's minds, but you could have just nudged him.
