My son Aaron recently turned 18 and I bought him a car for Christmas this year for working so hard in school. \n\nAudrey also chipped in to buy Aaron this gift but since she earns more than me it wasn't as big of a drain on her finances. My daughter Michelle 16f, asked for a new phone since her current phone is about 2 years old. Well after buying Aaron his car I didn't have enough to buy Michelle the phone she wanted, I asked Audrey to get the phone instead but was told she'd already bought gifts for Michelle and the main present was on me. \n\nI picked out a similar phone to the one Michelle already had but it wasn't the one she asked for. The phone I bought was about $150 which seemed like a lot to spend on a phone. \n\nWell on Christmas day Aaron and Michelle came over to open their gifts. Aaron loved his new car and was obviously very grateful. My daughter however seemed disappointed. She just smiled and said \"thanks\" without even taking the phone out of the box or turning it on. \n\nThis made me lose my temper and I yelled at Michelle for being a spoiled ungrateful brat. Michelle started crying and called her mom to pick her up. Audrey came by and yelled at me for favouring our son and not getting the phone our daughter wanted and then she and Michelle left. \n\nWell it's been almost a week and the phone is still here and Michelle hasn't called or texted me. Audrey is still ranting about how I had one job and should have set aside money for Michelle's gift. I don't think I was in the wrong, I think Michelle was being ungrateful and needed to be reminded of how lucky she was. But Aaron suggested I post here so Aita?.", "created_utc": 1672521858, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10041uu/aita_for_grounding_my_daughter_after_she_was/", "score": 917, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You spent thousands on your son but failed to budget for your daughter. Your favoritism shows. Also, she SMILED AND SAID THANKS and you still yelled at her. Why? Cause she didn't do a fake happy dance? She was perfectly polite and expressed gratitude. You suck as a dad and I wouldn't be surprised if she cuts you off as soon as she can.", "YTA, and here's why.\n\nFirst, you bought one kid A CAR and the other a phone without saying to the younger kid that if she works hard like her brother there is a car in her future as well.  \n\nSecond, you say \"The phone I bought was about $150 which seemed like a lot to spend on a phone,\" when that sounds like the least amount of money I have ever heard anyone spending for a phone.  In other words, you bought her a crappy phone.\n\nNext, your daughter said thanks but didn't lie and then you acted like a dick by yelling at Michelle and calling her a spoiled ungrateful brat.  I mean, WTF, man?  The behavior you described is not that of a spoiled ungrateful brat -- at all. \n\nNext, and this is the part that really pisses me off, you are not taking responsibility for your childish reaction.  \n\nInstead, you're demonstrating the classic behavior of an abusive person when you say \"This made me lose my temper,\" as though losing your temper was out of your control.   \n\nYour reaction to her was wildly out of proportion.\n\nLastly, it seems just bizarre when you say you felt that \"Michelle was being ungrateful and needed to be reminded of how lucky she was.\"\n\nNothing in your post shows that this young lady is lucky or ungrateful.  She received a crappy phone while her brother got a car.  She said thanks.  And then her father flew off the handle, called her a spoiled ungrateful brat, and made her cry.\n\nIf you are trying to lose your daughter forever you seem to be on track to pushing her right out of your life.   Everything you did was wrong.  If you care about her you should apologize profusely.", "`She just smiled and said \"thanks\" without even taking the phone out of the box or turning it on.`\n\nShe smiled and said \"thanks\".  YTA, Dad.  She did everything manners require her to do.  Sure she was disappointed, she didn't get the phone she wanted.  She didn't have a tantrum, you did.", "YTA to the point that your son mentioned posting here to watch you get obliterated.\n\nHow much was his car?", ">This made me lose my temper and I yelled at Michelle for being a spoiled ungrateful brat. \n\nWoah, overreaction much? YTA. No matter what, your reaction was absolutely uncalled for.", "Aaron knew the score....he sent you to total strangers to avoid pointing out that YTA....so bonus points for him....and just in case it is unclear the manner in which you handled the situation is the issue ...daughter must get her manners from someone else....and good thing too.", "YTA - Wow, your daughter was trying not to show how HURT she is by the fact that you bought your FAVORITE kid a car and couldn't even afford to get her a DECENT phone.  \n\n$150 phones are CRAP and you know it.  She didn't even throw a tantrum or call it trash, she smiled and THANKED you yet you grounded her for not kissing your ass for passing her barely scraps when she sees that you're so willing to spend so much more over her sibling.  \n\nThis is how you make kids go no contact with parents who treat them like garbage compared to their sibling.  \"Well, you aren't as valued as your sibling is to me, so be thankful I care at all.\"  \n\nWOW dude, just wow.", "YTA...You bought your son a car and your daughter a cheap phone and you don't understand why she was upset and disappointed. She didn't even say anything. She thanked you. Did you expect her to act excited when it was so obvious that she is an afterthought to you? What's wrong with you?", "YTA, you blew the budget on one kid, and then the other didn't fill you with praise. Seems she was graceful with her disappointment as well.", "Are you joking.\nFirst of all, you are an adult. Losing your temper and yelling at your child until she cries is unacceptable. Go to therapy. \nSecond, it\u2019s not about the cost - it\u2019s about the clear favoritism. If you got both kids a gift in the $100-$200 range that\u2019s one thing, but you SAVED UP to chip in $3000 to your son\u2019s car and couldn\u2019t be bothered to save/budget enough to get your daughter what she wanted. She didn\u2019t need your $150 phone, frankly whatever she currently has is UNDOUBTEDLY better than that. $150 for a phone is nothing these days.\n\nYTA and it sounds like a misogynist to boot.", "YTA. She smiled and said thanks, that's completely appropriate behavior. You were just mad she didn't react the way you wanted her to by acting overly excited about something that she already had. It wasn't the one that she wanted, but she still didn't complain. She was appreciative.", "YTA. \n\nYour hostile response is disproportionate to the reaction Michelle gave. Your response is to ground her for not being enthusiastic about being given the phone she asked for. She said thank you. \n\nLooks like you\u2019re quite mad at your ex for not chipping in more for a gift. When you saw Michelle react, you took out your frustration from the ex out on your daughter. \n\nIf you\u2019re frustrated at your ex, don\u2019t lash out at others.", "YTA.\n\nYou spent $3,000 on one child and $150 on the other.", "There's a spoiled ungrateful brat here, but it fucking sure isn't your daughter.  She smiled and said thanks, but because that wasn't enough for your ungrateful ass, so you decided to blow your lid like a toddler having a tantrum.  Guess you sure showed her.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nYou explode at her even though she smiled and said thank you?? Wtf?\n\nYou owe your daughter an apology.", "YTA\n\nYou spent $3000 on a gift for one kid and $150 on a crappy phone for the second kid. How would YOU feel if you were in your daughter's shoes? \n\nThere were so many ways to go with this that would have evened the gifts out. You could have given your son the downpayment for the car and then expected him to make the payments. You could have gotten a decent phone on your cell plan and paid it over many months. \n\nBut instead, you opted to go all out for one kid and not the other, and then you had the audacity to call your daughter a spoiled brat. You'll be lucky if you ever hear from her again.", "\u2018Needed reminding of how lucky she is\u2019 \n\nHow is she lucky exactly .. pray do tell ? \n\nYTA", "You seriously overreacted. At least she said thanks. Even if she was disappointed, at least she didn\u2019t argue with you about it and didn\u2019t tell you she hated her gift. \n\nIf $150 is a lot to spend on a phone in comparison to a car, mine cost over $1,500. I\u2019m a photographer and needed it, but I gave my daughter my old one, and that thing costed me $1,000.\n\nSo if you bought your son a new car, I really don\u2019t see why the phone she wanted would be a burden. It\u2019s clear that you didn\u2019t plan on buying her anything. You wanted to pawn that off on your ex-wife which is shitty planning on your part. You also mention nothing of her achievements (are her grades good, does she excel in school, does she do chores/help around the house, etc?), so it sounds like anything she has done in life so far means nothing to you.\n\nI\u2019m not saying your daughter shouldn\u2019t be grateful, but you seriously invalidated your daughter by pinching pennies on her gift in favor of buying your son a brand new car and clearly feel your son deserves more, which is favoritism and makes you an asshole.\n\nYTA.", "YTA - is this even a question? It feels like your daughter was an afterthought and I\u2019m sure she noticed it too. Not to mention that even with all that, she still said thank you, but you didn\u2019t think it was grateful enough and chose to berate her?\n\nWhat about when she turns 18? Do you plan on buying her a car and not saving money to get your son something?", "YTA \n\nAlso the title is wrong.  You didn't ground her,  she left you for her mother. \n\nShe wasn't ungrateful according to your explanation of events,  she just wasn't ecstatic with her gift.  While not overjoyed by her phone,  she's not the one that through a fit.  \n\nAnd failing to disclose the price of the car but mention the phone's seems like you know you treat them differently. I'm assuming this isn't the first time you have shown favoritism to your son either\n\nAlso what were the gifts your Ex were responsible for? Why would your ex help on your sons gift but not your daughters main gift?", "YTA \n\nHow do you think she felt, OP? You got him a fancy new car, while she got a very cheap phone. She didn't show any complaints, she said thanks with a smile. And you lost your shit. Immature in my eyes, OP", "YTA. The car would have been more appropriate as a birthday or graduation gift. Christmas is significant for both kids and you, as the adult, should have known better. Also, Michelle smiled and thanked you. That is perfectly polite. You are the one who messed up here.", "YTA. First you did not \"ground her\" you were verbally abusive. She smiled and said thank you, what were you expecting? a parade? \nAlso I have a few questions, \nDo you plan to buy a car for Michelle once she turns 18?\nHow much did Audrey chip in to buy the car?", "Okay so first of all there's a huge gap in the present prices. The son gets one worth thousands the daughter gets one worth $150. He's older, he's worked hard fine whatever, not a big deal.\n\nThen she takes the present, says \"thank you\" and you go off on her? She's supposed to fake excitement for obviously being a second thought for you? Bloody hell man you need to apologize right now. YTA YTA YTA", "I already posted my judgment but came back because your line \u201cMichelle needs to be reminded of how lucky she is\u201d is making me even more angry. She\u2019s lucky for what? Having a terrible father who favors her brother and thinks treating like the obviously less loved child and berates her for having feelings???", ">after buying Aaron his car I didn't have enough to buy Michelle the phone she wanted\n\nThen you should have spent less on your son's car.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The phone I bought was about $150 which seemed like a lot to spend on a phone.\n\nUnless you live under a rock, you know $150 isn't a lot to spend on a phone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She just smiled and said \"thanks\" without even taking the phone out of the box or turning it on. This made me lose my temper and I yelled at Michelle for being a spoiled ungrateful brat.

YTA.", "YTA.\n\nAnd people will rip you apart for the uneven treatment of your childrien, but you're a massive asshole exactly for what you asked - for your reaction. What the hell did she do to deserve that?!\n\nShe expected more, didn't get it, and was of course disappointed. She didn't cause a scene or act out in any way, you just decided it was some huge offense that she wasn't over the moon.", "Are you being serious?\n\nYou got your son A WHOLE ASS CAR, and you couldn't be bothered to get your daughter the FAR LESS expensive gift that she asked for?\n\nAnd then when she didn't react the way *you* wanted her to, you flipped your shit?\n\nAre you ok?  Do you even like your daughter?\n\nWTF dude?\n\nYTA.

You should\u2019ve given her money so she can use it to buy the phone she wants or should\u2019ve chipped in less money for your sons car to have enough to buy your daughter the phone. \n\nYour ex wife could\u2019ve done the same also. No need to buy a first time car owner something too expensive. You only yelled at her because you felt guilty. That\u2019s the only reason why, you know you\u2019re the AH.", "You bought one kid a car and the other the same model phone they already had but here you are asking the interwebs if you are an AH. \n\nYour daughter thanked you for the gift. Did you expect her to do cartwheels? Saying thank you is showing gratitude. Honestly, you didn\u2019t even deserve that. The gifts were disproportionate and made worse by your daughter being an afterthought. \n\nSince you don\u2019t seem put back money for her Christmas gifts, at least start saving for her therapy sessions.

You knew she'd be disappointed, you practically set her up to be. Something tells me that if you really dug deep on this, you'd figure out that the berating you gave her was really just the disappointment and embarrassment you feel about yourself being projected onto her.", "She smiled and thanked you, and your response was to blow up on her. After you explicitly DIDN'T get her what she asked for, and you got her brother a CAR. YTA.", "YTA. If you already knew the main present to your daughter was your responsibility, you needed to spend less on the car for your son. From the outside it does look like you favored him over her. You needed to get on the same page with your ex. And you don't get to punish someone for not being happy with you. That's petty.", "YTA.  Really you bought one kid a car and then you bought the other one a crappy ass cheap phone yeah you're the a******", "YTA. She didn\u2019t behave badly, she didn\u2019t have the feelings you wanted her to have. You lost your rag and shouted at a child for not being a skilled actor. You also gave one kid a whole car, and the other a token. If you\u2019re trying to tell people you think $150 is a lot to spend on a phone, you\u2019re also not a skilled actor.", "YTA, how could you spend so differently on your 2 children?", "YTA. Your daughter said thanks. She didn't complain or make a scene. That was the polite thing to do. You shouldn't punish her just because she didn't like the gift you got her.", "YTA. This really shouldn't need explanation. You spent 3k on your son's gift, and spent 150 on hers, and it was something you knew she didn't want.  \n\nShe didn't pitch a fit, she didn't call you out for your favoritism, she just seemed disappointed in a disappointing gift.

You are acting like a soiled child. YTA", "YTA she was polite and said thank you even though she was disappointed in her gift.

YTA. :/", "YTA. I didn\u2019t even know you can still buy phones for $150 - like seriously, is it a RAZR phone that still uses t9 texting?  She said thank you and was obviously disappointed, you\u2019re the one who gave obviously not proportional gifts and are a shitty father.", "YTA. She at least said thank you. A car vs a cheap phone.

Wow, she totally sounds \u201cungrateful\u201d! oh wait, that\u2019s not the word I was thinking, how about disappointed in the clear favouritism you are showing!

It's clear that anything less of her actually magically changing her wants and emotions to placate you was never going to be good enough.

My son Aaron recently turned 18 and I bought him a car for Christmas this year for working so hard in school. \n\nAudrey also chipped in to buy Aaron this gift but since she earns more than me it wasn't as big of a drain on her finances. My daughter Michelle 16f, asked for a new phone since her current phone is about 2 years old. Well after buying Aaron his car I didn't have enough to buy Michelle the phone she wanted, I asked Audrey to get the phone instead but was told she'd already bought gifts for Michelle and the main present was on me. \n\nI picked out a similar phone to the one Michelle already had but it wasn't the one she asked for. The phone I bought was about $150 which seemed like a lot to spend on a phone. \n\nWell on Christmas day Aaron and Michelle came over to open their gifts. Aaron loved his new car and was obviously very grateful. My daughter however seemed disappointed. She just smiled and said \"thanks\" without even taking the phone out of the box or turning it on. \n\nThis made me lose my temper and I yelled at Michelle for being a spoiled ungrateful brat. Michelle started crying and called her mom to pick her up. Audrey came by and yelled at me for favouring our son and not getting the phone our daughter wanted and then she and Michelle left. \n\nWell it's been almost a week and the phone is still here and Michelle hasn't called or texted me. Audrey is still ranting about how I had one job and should have set aside money for Michelle's gift. I don't think I was in the wrong, I think Michelle was being ungrateful and needed to be reminded of how lucky she was. But Aaron suggested I post here so Aita?.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Great way to show how that your a misogynist to your daughter. That her needs are not important like your son is. You gave her the same model phone like her old one.

You knew that the phone that you got her wasn\u2019t the one that she wanted, so why in the world would you expect a super happy response? You\u2019re forgetting that Michelle is 16 and she just got watched her brother get a brand new car, while she got a cheap phone.of course she was bummed.

You two could've even compromised and said that if she sticks with this temporarily until you can save money again then you can buy the phone she wanted.", "So just to be clear: you bought one child a car and the other a $150 phone (that\u2019s seriously cheap for a phone nowadays) and then you flipped out and started yelling at her when she didn\u2019t pretend to be sufficiently excited at your lackluster gift?\n\nYTA.

Michelle wasn't ungrateful, she was sad because her brother got a huge gift and she got one she hadn't wanted. My sister totaled the car I was supposed to get handed down, and was gifted a brand new car right around my 16th birthday, so I feel this pretty deeply. Michelle was hurt and felt the favoritism toward her brother. She tried to be polite but she's not at fault for not hiding her disappointment better. You and your ex really need to work on your parenting.", "YTA OP and this kind of reminds me of a post where dad tries his best to connect to his daughter but his way of connecting was just like you, example \"she should be grateful I'm making breakfast for her or I'm letting her stay under my roof or making off handed comments that her daughter is not smart even though she was in law school\". Wanna know what happened, daughter cut off contact from him, won't update any life events, won't come to christmas and that poor man had no one to be with him. \nI can already see her going low to no contact. You are comparing a $3000 gift to $150 and your comments she should be grateful for her gift that just shows how little you care about her. \nI can already see a post few years from now \"my daughter is not inviting me to her wedding, I don't know why\". You clearly know why, considering how your son has sent you here he does realise about your blatant favouritism, it's just a matter of time that there will be a fallout. OP your kids are young you still have time and opportunity to turn things around.", "YTA, can't get one kid a car for thousands and then cheap out on a phone for the other kid.", "There's a couple additional issues I'd like to bring up. It sounds like you're talking to your son about the whole thing, which is inappropriate. Do not under any circumstances try to make your children take sides. It's seriously harmful to drag children into parental issues, so work it out with your wife and apologize to your children.\n\nSecond, you're taking full credit for buying the car, but you didn't yourself - his mother helped. You're then using this as the excuse to have not given your other child a meaningful present. Other commenters are right - you should have told her you'd do the same for her when she's older, and she'd probably have felt better about it. Think of it this way - you bought your son an entire car, and then didn't even listen to what she wanted and got her something cheaper. She clearly doesn't feel like she's worth as much to you, which is a very fair temporary reaction from someone that age, and then you yelled at her instead of talking about it. \n\nChildren require a lot of empathy. Their reactions don't always make sense from an adult perspective, and they don't have to. If you had had a conversation with her acknowledging her very valid feelings and telling her she'd get the same in the future, this would have turned out very differently, but your ego got in the way, and you hurt your daughter in the process. You owe her an apology; not a different phone, but an apology for your behavior. You are also not entitled to someone liking your gifts either. She was very polite despite being disappointed; the issue lies with your reaction, not hers.", "YTA", "Congratulations, you\u2019re never gonna see your daughter again. Are you happy?", "YTA. You spent WAY more on your son\u2019s gift than your daughter\u2019s and you expected her to be grateful and super happy with the blatant favoritism?

I would imagine your daughter would have been super happy had you gotten her the phone she wanted even though it *still* would have cost less than what you put toward the car. \n\nYour daughter was polite and said thank you, you then completely over reacted because she wasn\u2019t over the moon to receive a cheaper phone than she asked for. Sad as it is $150 is not much at all to spend on a phone and it was likely a model at least as old as the phone she already had.", "So in your eyes your son is worth a gift costing 10-20k but your daughter isn\u2019t even worth $150? YTA. Stop favoring your son.", "YTA, but your ex is TA also. Who doesn't discuss gifts in advance?

What year are you living in? My phone cost over $1k that I paid off over two years. I can\u2019t even imagine what $150 gets you.

Not now.\n\nGetting your son a car was a very nice, expensive idea. It\u2019s not like you had to spend the same amount on your daughter, but there seems to be a favouritism thing going on here.

You\u2019re also kidding yourself if you think your little temper tantrum taught your daughter any kind of lesson about being grateful. In reality you probably damaged your relationship with her. \n\nIt also seems like you could have avoided getting your daughter a cheaper version of the present she actually wanted (while buying your son a freaking car) if you had had just communicated and planned accordingly with your ex wife.

She did not make a scene. You, however, did. \n\nThat's a crazy disproportionate reaction for you to have, and what you did is not in the least reflective of reminding your daughter of how lucky she is. All you really seemed to accomplish here was effectively ruin the Christmas occasion with your fit because I sincerely doubt anyone could stomach any amount of joy after the fact.\n\nHonestly, I read this and all I can imagine is that you were too embarrassed that you didn't manage the finances behind this properly and it became too much for you when your daughter didn't just gush with happiness. If that's even close to the truth of the matter, it's disgustingly immature.\n\nI can't tell if this is fake or if you're just delusional. YTA.", "YTA. Enjoy going her going no contact with you.

YTA.", ">My daughter however seemed disappointed. She just smiled and said \"thanks\" \n\nSo she WAS grateful, she just didn't fawn over your afterthought gift like your son did over his clearly awesome one. What shit parenting.

A phone she wanted to get rid of. \n\nEveryone is focusing on how much of a miser you are, which is understandable, but you\u2019re worse than a cheapskate.

It\u2019s totally possible that they could improve their entire relationship after talking about this one instance. What if her dad sees the verdict here and is the one to approach his daughter and acknowledge he messed up? Life with no dad does not equal better life, even if he\u2019s an asshole sometimes (just like every other human being is an asshole sometimes).
