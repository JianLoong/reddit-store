Appears to be some controlling behaviours and insecurities there.\n\nYou said you made a comment on your \"mates page\" - so if someone is a friend it is OK to follow them on social media.

Very weird and kinda stalker-ish", "Only dating a month? Yikes. Shes already showing red flags. The argument are only going to get worse from here if you continue this relationship.

You must never see them again!\"\n\nI would be nopeing on outta that relationship. NTA", "What the actual fuckity fuck have I just read? You guys have been together a month and she\u2019s acting like this?\n\nI\u2019m not usually one who comments to dump/divorce/run from your SO but jeeeez love, run far and fast!\n\nNTA", "There is a solution to this. Run, that's a red flag, she is overly jealous and probably insecure. NTA. \n\nFirst she's gonna demand you unfriend and unfollow any female on your social media platforms. Then she'll demand you cut ties with your female friends. You wont be able to hang out with your friends (male or female) or at least not without her, and the list goes on. You don't need that.

I had a girlfriend freshman year of university who would cry and be very manipulative if I thought ANYONE else was attractive. This included people like movie stars and celebrities. Save yourself the trouble and get her out of your life ASAP.", "NTA - she's wrong. Just because you find someone attractive ; doesn't mean that you are attracted to them. I think many of friends (and relatives) are attractive, doesn't mean I'm sexually attracted to them. She needs to grow up.", "NTA. Your gf is unstable and this will never end. She\u2019s shown her true colours early so you\u2019re lucky as you can get out early without years of baggage with her. The fact she obviously went through your socials to find a post more than a year old, says a lot about her obsessive character, this is where her demands and expectations of you will start and it will get worse and worse. Gtfo now before she starts demanding passwords or joint socials. Find a relationship where there is trust and respect, and banter about stuff like this. You cannot live your life in a relationship where your partner is controlling and manipulating you. Life is too short. Be happy.

You have to remove every comment no matter how it was intended? Yeah, NTA. Personally, I would move on.", "Take my upvote, and I'm not even angry giving it. People look, that doesn't mean they want to trade what they have for what they see. If you are that insecure that your partner can't look or make a comment then you need help. It would be different if op was going on and on to gf about this other person, but that doesn't seem to be the case.", "Upvote", "She would seriously be on my last nerve. That's fer danged sure."]}
