If she needs time to think, tell her you'll give her time but she either needs to provide a solution or there isn't a need to bring it up again. \n\nAlso, don't keep trying to justify why you commented that. She genuinely doesn't care. She's just ticked off that you did.\n\nLastly, yes you think she's acting irrational. She is. She's got issues with jealousy. No one is perfect. That's just how it is. Ask her this though: \"Did seeing my comment on her picture remind you of something bad that happened in the past.\" \nEvery reaction has a cause. She needs to tell you what triggered that reaction.It's very helpful to know how to avoid getting us upset \ud83d\ude0a\n\nAfter reading someone else's comment, I very much would like to add that understanding why she's upset and trying to reconcile does not mean she gets to be in charge of who you socialize with, if she does find your friendship uncomfortable. Jealousy is a tough thing to get over but she's going to have to suck it up a little and trust you. It's not fair to treat you like you've already broken trust even though you obviously haven't.

What does the girlfriend expect Op to do, cut all his friends from his life unless they are \u201cugly\u201d!? This is so unreasonable and controlling.\n\nOP, there is nothing wrong with complimenting a friend on their looks even if you are in a relationship (as long as it\u2019s done respectfully). And just because you complimented someone\u2019s look doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you are attracted to them. I can recognise and appreciate that someone is aesthetically pleasing without feeling attracted to them! Friends compliment friends all the time and hype each other up- that\u2019s what friends are for! \n\nBesides, it is okay to find other people attractive even if you are in a relationship, being committed doesn\u2019t make you blind. What matters if you act on it and if she doesn\u2019t trust you to be friends with attractive people, there\u2019s no point to a relationship without trust, it can\u2019t last long.
