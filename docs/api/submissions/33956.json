He went to prison last week and he will not get out until the kids are grown. He\u2019s always had a strained relationship with his siblings because of some trouble he got into in college (which resulted in a 4 year prison stint). I didn\u2019t know about any of this before we were married; he was a master at hiding things from me. The rest of the sibs seem to have close relationships and the cousins spend a lot of time together. They\u2019ve never treated my kids the same. \n\nNow that my ex is in prison, they suddenly took an interest in the kids. One invited us to her house for Christmas so we went. I need to redo my will and name someone as a guardian of the children should I die. My mom is not I. Good health and none of my siblings are in a position to take that on. All of his sisters are married and financially well off. One has 3 kids that are practically grown, one has 14 yo twins, the other has 2 small children. Brother is not married/has no kids. Their mom is regularly in the kids lives but she\u2019s getting older and her health is not so great. Financially, they\u2019ll be taken care of (life insurance, assets, etc). \n\nI brought it up to my xSIL and she said that she thought it would be too much for one person and suggested separating them. I told her I wasn\u2019t comfortable with that. Imagine taking traumatized children who have lost their parents, their home, and their schools, and then taking them away from each other. It\u2019s cruel. We dropped it that day but the more I try thought about it, the angrier I became. When I got back home, I texted her and told her that I changed my mind because I want my children to be raised by someone who wants them and I would ask a friend instead. \n\nLater, I got into an argument with a different sister over it. They all seem to feel that it\u2019s asking too much. I can\u2019t fathom a family that doesn\u2019t take care of each other. I would take any of my sibs kids, even if I had to financially support them myself.", "created_utc": 1703810984, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18t9qdn/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_exs_siblings_dont/", "score": 786, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why should they, people who don't even know kids, be saddle with the responsibility? \n\nYou saw that they have money and positive relationships with each other said: yes, wealth. Your siblings could take care of your kids, you just are enamored with the cash.", "YTA. It is unreasonable to expect someone to take on this responsibility just because they are part of your kids' lives.", "I think OP has watched way too many \"23yo takes in 6 of her nieces and nephews while still in college\" movies. One Christmas dinner does not make a Norman Rockwell family. If the children would be provided for financially, why wouldn't that money be used for their upbringing with one of OPs relatives? She's pretty much laid out every scenario except that one.", "Soft yta. Three kids is a lot, especially for those who already have kids. Splitting them and keeping them in safe loving familial homes is far better than foster care, where they'd be split up anyway.\nAlso, it sounds like you just re-entered your ILs lives, and you're already asking them to accept responsibility for your kids if you die? Really? Slow your roll. Why are you getting heated over a hypothetical?", "Lols, are you really asking the obvious? Of course you\u2019re the AH.", "YTA. You can ask, and they can say no. You assume they would be fine to take care of your three children because they have money and are married, but you don't know all of the ins and outs of their lives.", "You\u2019re entitled to feel upset, but YTA for assuming people should be willing to take on your burden.", "YTA. You\u2019re only choosing your ex in laws because they are financially well off. And you\u2019re mad at them if they can\u2019t take in all of your kids together? Why about your own family then? Why aren\u2019t you mad at them for not being financially well off to take your kids in?", "YTA. Why feud with them over a hypothetical situation? Are you maybe subconsciously sabotaging this relationship out of jealousy? Have you considered that maybe your kids would like to just have a chance to get to know their fathers family better without unecessary drama which they clearly have enough of?", "YTA. You can't force your kids on anyone. Especially when you are being superbiased and skipping your direct blood relatives.", "YTA.\n\nIt would be nice if they did this but they don\u2019t know the kids at all, and it\u2019s because their dad behaved badly.\n\nDemanding they take this on is a lot.", "Yta. I assume that you're not dying, so this is just in case. 17 isn't really an issue so it's the 11 and 7 that you need a real plan for. I can see why that would seem like a big commitment to anyone, especially if they are no contact with the kids dad and the dad still gas rights to the kids and potential to be back in their life.\n\nIt's a big thing to ask someone to take on, what would be, 2 traumatised preteens and blend them into an existingfamily or take on a decademof parenting when your already an empty nester ir never raised a kid. Plus they have only recently been a part of the kids lives.\n\n1 option would be to ask if they would consider a joint custody situation where the 7 and 11 stay together but move between houses (like a coparenting situation) not ideal I know.\n\nAnother option ask your friends.\n\nA third option is to have x person designated for the next 3 years and then review. 17 will be 19 or so you could ask (ask) them to be the younger siblings guardian if needed. Whilst stressingbyhat it's unlikely to be needed, walk them through a plan of how to make it work. Ie how to finish college and raise the kids.\n\nWhy is it that you consider your families reason valid but not the in laws?", "YTA\n\nIf you want, you can take care of other children - that's your right. \n\nIt is also your right to ask your husband's siblings if they agree to become guardians of your children in the future - and they have the right to refuse you this. \n\nAnd in this case, you do not have the right to demand this from them, even if they are your husband\u2019s relatives. \n\nThey have every right to choose only the care of their children, their comfort and their family", "YTA - You said yourself that them taking an interest in you and your children is a new thing, asking them to potentially take more than a decade long responsibility in children they hardly know yet is too extreme.\n\nIf anything, you should be upset with the family on your side.", "YTA. Wow.", "YTA. So none of your family members are in position to take all three of them at the same time because of reasons, but you want to force your ex's family, who obviously had very valid reasons to maintain their distance while your ex was in the picture, to take all of them at the same time regardless of their needs and confort. To have to take care of three kids suddenly at the same time really is a lot. You seem to understand why your family can't do it, why you don't extend the same courtesy to your ex's family when they respectfully expressed valid concerns? The fact that you would do it for your sibling's kids (but you understand why your siblings can't do it for yours) is easy to say when you are not in a real obligation to make that promise a reality. And you are an hypocrite for justifying your family and getting mad to people from whom you have been strained for years.", "NAH\n\nYou\u2019re right to look elsewhere and to let these aunts and uncles know why (speaking not as a parent and as the granddaughter of someone whose sibling set was broken up after their mother died). And you\u2019re right to seek someone who will be ready if you get hit by a bus tomorrow because there\u2019s always a chance of that. And I agree with you that family should exert themselves for parent less children, not reserving their kindness for just when it\u2019s convenient.\n\nThey\u2019re right to look hard at their existing responsibilities and consider how their own kids would fare if they took on yours. They are whole people with lives.", "NAH. You can be hurt, but their reaction is entirely reasonable. Yes, it would be great if they all wanted to keep all 3 kids together, but that is a lot to ask of anyone so it shouldn\u2019t be expected - especially of in-laws who don\u2019t really know your family well. \n\nYou getting into arguments with them over it is just self-defeating. You\u2019re just doing more to turn them off you and your children. \n\nIf your children will be financially well off after you die, what does it matter that the ILs are married and financially well off? You're not expecting them to absorb expenses, right? Plenty of people have children at 25 years old and your eldest is nearly an adult. Why can you ask your 25-year old sibling if they\u2019d take care of the younger two?", "YTA\n\nYou're upset that someone that doesn't really know your kids isn't willing to take on the GINORMOUS responsibility that comes with caring for 2 kids?! LMFAO..... You're asking someone to take over being a parent for you..... AND mop up the grief that will likely be there in the wake of your death........ I hate to say it, but you should be speaking with your soon to be adult daughter about this. She'd likely be over 18. So if no other family is willing to care for the younger two, you might want to sit down and talk to her about it... Start a savings fund just in case and make sure you have life insurance. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with asking distant in-laws, but you don't get to be upset about it..... That's a big responsibility to take on when you don't even really know the kids.", "YTA - Do you really not see how hypocritical you sound?  It\u2019s totally fine for your own siblings to not be able to take them, but you think your SIL is selfish for feeling that she wouldn\u2019t be able to support THREE additional children?  Wow.", "YTA. This is called burning your bridge. Going off on a person you don\u2019t even have a blood connection, nor an established familial one. You set one hell of an early impression on them. I doubt they\u2019ll trust to know you or your kids after this. If you hope to salvage this relationship, I suggest you show some contrition and apologize and figure a means to rebuild trust.", "Yah anyone has the right to say no to that. You don\u2019t have a right to be upset over a no.", "Soft YTA - if the tables were turned could you commit to taking on 3 kids? Not many people could say yes.", "YTA. Taking on three children is a big ask and you have to be sympathetic to that. Combined with the factor they do not get on with the father you are also asking for potential trouble to come from their door resulting from that. These children are also strangers to them. Plus you fling this at this side of the family but are not upset or expressing at your side of the family.\n\nYour eldest daughter is nearly at adult so what you should be working is getting her independent and settled. Then you only have to worry about your younger two. \n\nBut hopefully this is hypothetical because it seems your making damn sure to burn bridges rather than creating them.", "From what I can tell based on the narrative you wrote\u2026 you were having a conversation with your ex-husband\u2018s sister. She philosophically suggested that it\u2019s a big ask to have multiple kids dropped on someone. You took this badly, went home, and sent a super passive-aggressive text implicitly attacking the family that has, it seems, tried to extend you an olive branch during Christmas. Because of a conversation. YTA", "YTA. You have had zero relationship with these people but now after just starting to get to know one another you are making demands and judging them. 3 kids is a lot. You say they are well off but you don\u2019t know that. what people show to the outside world isn\u2019t always a fact and asking people to take on 3 traumatised kids that they will have to raise and pay for it\u2019s not ok to just expect that then have a hissy fit when they don\u2019t immediately accept.", "Yta and you are asking a lot for someone to take on multiple kids when they have their own kids \u2026 it sucks but no one has to , if they all see each-other splitting them may not be that traumatic", "YTA are you so blinkered in your life that you can\u2019t read a room? they are trying to get to know your children while your useless ex husband is in prison, to start a relationship with them. This is like meeting a new friend in the park and asking them the same. \n\nYou don\u2019t have a relationship with them and neither do your kids. Your 17 year old will be an adult soon.", "Im sure they went through hell with your ex and didn\u2019t want to bring drama to their house. Don\u2019t take this time away from your kids. \n\nFigure things out with the friend and then pApologize to them. It is an individual choice and should not be held against them. Just explain it was an emotional time.\n\nThey are correct that it is a lot to ask. Your views are not theirs so get over it.\n\nThey at least reached out and wanted to get to know the kids. Let the kids enjoy the aunt/ uncles and cousins. I\u2019m sure they like getting to know the family.", "NTA. Family matters.", "INFO: When the oldest is 18 will she be able to be the guardian? I know it\u2019s a huge ask of someone so young but the younger ones aren\u2019t babies. Maybe the aunts would be keener to help if they were supporting your kids to stay in their own home with the eldest in charge?", "YTA lmao", "Yta", "YTA. You are getting furious over a hypothetical situation. That is not rational. Plus your fantasy includes all your kids suddenly dropped in somebody's lap and them being fine with the infinitely increased burden they are put in.", "YTA.  Your family gets a pass on taking on the burden of raising YOUR kids, but your ex\u2019s family has no choice but to do it your way, when they have families of their own to support?  No thanks, I\u2019d pass on that too.  You don\u2019t get to cry \u201cbut family takes care of each other\u201d when it only applies to them supporting your needs/ wants.", "YTA you don't even know these people or how they would they are as parents.\nWhy would you want your kids to live with someone who doesn't want them?", "YTA", "YTA. Beggars don't get to be choosers.", "YTA. It IS a lot for one person to take on. Are you planning to take in any of their children should something happen to them? Oh gee, why not? Your situation sucks, and I wouldn\u2019t want siblings to be separated either. But you do not get to demand this of people. Certainly if they won\u2019t commit to what you want then ask someone else. But don\u2019t you dare guilt them over not wanting to take in three children.", "ESH - you for getting mad , in-laws for not taking in family if a death occurred. They don\u2019t trust your side because of their shady ass brother. Best to create a bond with them and show them your kids aren\u2019t like their father. Thinking they\u2019ll take your kids without a bond is messed up especially if they know their brother. Show them you are different .", "ESH\n\nThis is something you ask of people when you have a close relationship. You should not assume others are willing to take on that burden and they are not assholes if they don't want to. It is not other's responsibility to own your life choices if you are not there to take care of your obligations. I'm not saying this to be mean, I'm saying this because it is a fact. Keep yourself in good health and then build a relationship with his siblings and reapproach it in a year or two. For now try to find someone else or be willing to have your children separated if that were the need. With a child that's almost an adult there is the possibility of having money set aside for that child to help care for their siblings if the scenario arises although it would be an extreme burden for a young adult.", "YTA. No one is obligated to take your kids in. Plus how did you not know he wasn\u2019t in prison before. I find that doubtful.", "YTA \n\n> I can\u2019t fathom a family that doesn\u2019t take care of each other \n\nOkay but apparently none of your siblings can take them and you\u2019re just like, that\u2019s fine, and decided to lash out at your ex-in laws?\n\nNo one is obligated to take care of your children if you happen to no longer be around.", "Yta. It sounds like you\u2019re trying to set your kids up with the most financially well off relatives so that they can reap the benefits. You\u2019ve known these people for 1 week and you\u2019re already asking them to make a serious legal commitment like that. Your intentions seem to be questionable at best. Maybe take a step back, get to know the family, and see how things go.", "So, you\u2019re just building a relationship and you\u2019re asking them to take your kids?  It\u2019s good you are making plans but let them build a bond with the kids first", "YTA. For everything mentioned by others. Plus:\n\n-Unless you die in the next few months, your eldest will be an adult, so soon they will go and live their own life anyway. \n\n- The financial burden would be huge, nearly doubling the size of the family. Do any of them have a home big enough to take all of them? An income big enough. This is probably why they talk about separating them, between the siblings knowing that they would likely still see each other a lot. Plus their life would be thrown upside down.\n\n- They are basically strangers to your kids and you. So the fact they are considering such a massive commitment from someone they don't know, particularly knowing the trauma that comes with kids whose parents are in prison/lost a parent is massive.\n\nYou owe them a massive apology or your kids might be losing on knowing this side of the family because of your entitled behaviour.", "Yta I'm sorry", "\u201cI completely understand why none of my siblings are in a position to take 3 kids on, but I don\u2019t understand how his siblings, who barely know my kids and are just getting to know us can\u2019t financially, physically and mentally take on 3 random kids they don\u2019t know??

They didn't choose to have those kids, you did. \n\nOne of them has kids almost grown, and you expect her to take on the raising of more kids after she's finally done raising her own.\n\nOne of them already has twins to take care of, and you expect her to add two or three more to that.\n\nOne has two small children and you expect her to deal with your kids on top of hers.\n\nOne of them has no kids, presumably by choice, and you expect him to raise yours when he didn't want kids to begin with.\n\nWhat you're asking of them is huge. And while I'm not saying you're an asshole for asking, you definitely are for being angry at them for saying it's too much. You're not thinking of their well being at all, they're just potential guardians to you.", "YTA, nobody has to take in your kids at all so stop with the entitlement.  I\u2019m not sure if you fully understand that what you\u2019re asking for is a gigantic favor and a burden.  You should be grateful they offered to take them in separately.

If they don\u2019t feel comfortable with it that\u2019s enough reason alone. It\u2019s good that you look for someone just in case, but you should accept the answer without guilt tripping and it is wrong to assume that just because you would take on a certain responsibility they should do the same. Real family would accept everyone\u2019s boundaries without questioning how much of a family they are when their answer is not in your favor.", "YTA. I get where your coming from. I was a single mom for years and it scares me to think what happens with my 2 kids if I die. It\u2019s great when family is able to come together for something like that but just because your ExSil is rich and well off doesn\u2019t mean she needs to take on someone else\u2019s kids.

Horrible things happen to children in foster care and I don\u2019t think my family could pull off any kind of decent childhood for them.

He went to prison last week and he will not get out until the kids are grown. He\u2019s always had a strained relationship with his siblings because of some trouble he got into in college (which resulted in a 4 year prison stint). I didn\u2019t know about any of this before we were married; he was a master at hiding things from me. The rest of the sibs seem to have close relationships and the cousins spend a lot of time together. They\u2019ve never treated my kids the same. \n\nNow that my ex is in prison, they suddenly took an interest in the kids. One invited us to her house for Christmas so we went. I need to redo my will and name someone as a guardian of the children should I die. My mom is not I. Good health and none of my siblings are in a position to take that on. All of his sisters are married and financially well off. One has 3 kids that are practically grown, one has 14 yo twins, the other has 2 small children. Brother is not married/has no kids. Their mom is regularly in the kids lives but she\u2019s getting older and her health is not so great. Financially, they\u2019ll be taken care of (life insurance, assets, etc). \n\nI brought it up to my xSIL and she said that she thought it would be too much for one person and suggested separating them. I told her I wasn\u2019t comfortable with that. Imagine taking traumatized children who have lost their parents, their home, and their schools, and then taking them away from each other. It\u2019s cruel. We dropped it that day but the more I try thought about it, the angrier I became. When I got back home, I texted her and told her that I changed my mind because I want my children to be raised by someone who wants them and I would ask a friend instead. \n\nLater, I got into an argument with a different sister over it. They all seem to feel that it\u2019s asking too much. I can\u2019t fathom a family that doesn\u2019t take care of each other. I would take any of my sibs kids, even if I had to financially support them myself.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The best place for a child(ren) to be is where they are loved and safe.

Or maybe they do like you in general, they know your ex better than you do, and maybe you ignored their warnings about him?\n\nWho knows, that's all speculation.\n\nWhat it comes down to now is you're making a Heavy Ask for someone in his family to take over responsibility for the kids you chose to have with a felon, and none of them want to do that. \n\nYou can keep fighting with them, but you will keep losing.\n\nYou're in a tough spot. That sucks. But it's on you to figure this out, not them.\n\nNAH.", "I will never understand people who decide to have kids then are baffled when nobody else wants to act as parent for them. YTA.", "So you expect them to go from 2-3 kids to 6 overnight? Cause your husband went to prison, and you plan on dying? Great choice to become parents not once, not twice but three times? It is too much, and no one owes you anything. Even asking them to take on one each is a lot. How about your husband getting out of jail? How about you take care of your health and live for your kids? People who had no interest in you before you automatically jump to the Shrek Donkey \"Can I stay with you?\" Get out of their swamp Donkey!!! YTA definitely make other plans for your kids.", "But, but they're well off so can afford it.  That obligates them to raise her kids.  /s", "They are trying to see what is best, and talking with us about it. They have good friends there (especially a couple, which is a possibility) but all their family is here (my BIL is Spanish as well, although he was born in another city than my sister). They just think it would be better not to uproot him and take him away from everything he had known if that happens. It is a reasonable fear, but I can't promise to move there and leave everything behind (my BIL have other family, but older than me, who doesn't understand English and who have family obligations here). They have yet to reach a decision, but they know that if they want him to remain within the family if the unthinkable happens, he will need to move to Spain, either with me, or with my BIL's siblings. But all of us are in Spain, they are the only ones in both families who live abroad. In any case, I just wanted to point out to OP that lack of love or commitment to the family is not always the issue to say no to take care of children of the family. I love my nephew very much. I would take him in a heartbeat, and support him with my own means, and take food of my mouth to give it to him, no questions asked, but here, where I have my life, and his grandparents, my job, and my boyfriend."]}
