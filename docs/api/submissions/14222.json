Eventually, my wife asks me what's wrong, so I respond that I have a bit of a headache and can't tell if it's a migraine or not. \n\nMy MIL, in the back seat, asks me if everything is okay, to which I truthfully reply \"I think I'm fine, I am just trying out some new meds my psychiatrist recommended for my ADHD and I'm still getting used to making sure I eat at the right times and avoid my typical amount of coffee, so I think that might be causing my headache.\" It's important to note I was initially diagnosed a year ago, and just started taking meds a month ago. After we drop off my inlaws and we are alone in the car again, my wife asks me why I told her parents what I did, and I should have just lied and told them I had a headache and don't know why. \n\nMy response to this was \"I don't like lying to your parents about things i shouldn't need to lie about. I told them the truth, and as much of it as I felt comfortable telling.\"\n\nNOW, the part where I may be a bit of an AH. A few days later, while away on business, i get a call from my wife, complaining to me that her mother has been on the phone with her for 45 minutes trying to grill her about my ADHD, meds and what was happening, wanting to know the reason, when it all started, etc. Wife starts to get mad at me saying she knew I shouldn't have said anything and now her mom won't leave her alone about it. My response to this was simple. \"I told your parents about what was happening at that time, and shared all I felt like sharing about what was going on. It's on them to respect that\". \n\nWife: \"you should just tell them about it and share why you're on meds so they leave me alone\". \n\nI don't want to share that, it's an extremely personal side effect of my ADHD and the meds have really helped, but I don't want to share it, especially with my in laws. \n\nMe: \"I don't want to share that, and you know why. I'm not changing my mind on that. tell your parents I'll share what I feel comfortable with, when I feel comfortable with and to leave it alone\"\n\nWife: \"they won't listen and will just keep bothering me. Just tell them so they feel better and I don't have to deal with this\"\n\nMe: \"It's not my fault that your parents don't respect boundaries and that you haven't enforced them enough to listen when you try to. That's on you and your mother. Not me because I decided not to lie.

You are under NO obligation to speak about any of your medical stuff with your ILs unless YOU choose to.", "I don\u2019t think you are the asshole in all honesty. You have your right to your privacy and to share what you are comfortable with. It sounds to me like they do not know how to respect boundaries. Yeah man you\u2019re good on this one.", "NTA- its your private medical business and your in laws are violating your boundaries. Do not let them pressure you into sharing more than you want, also not sure what else they wanna know, they already know you have ADHD and take meds. People saying YTA are completely brushing over the fact that your in-laws and extended family are not entitled to know everything about your medical history, even if they are family and mean well. And even if you already shared some info. There is a\nlot of stigma that surrounds mental health and medication, especially for men so if you don\u2019t wanna subject yourself to that it is your choice and its understandable. I feel for your wife, but she needs to put her foot down and set boundaries with her mother otherwise this will just keep on manifesting in other areas of your life with your in-laws feeling entitled to know about your personal matters.", "ESH - You're both communicating poorly.\n\nLet me rephrase the issue - you wife is asking you to stop discussing things where you want to limit info because her mom takes any discussion as an invitation to pry, and then SHE has to manage her mom's prying. Stop sharing info with your MIL, limiting responses is not lying.\n\n>and occasionally drops hints her mom is mad I don't want to share more\n\nShe's telling you about it because she has to hear about it - you have made it her problem to manage her mom's inappropriate boundaries.", "Probably ESH, but maybe NTA.  If you know your MIL is going to act this way, keeping her on an information diet is the best for you and your wife.  You aren't lying by saying you have a headache and you don't want to come off as cranky. Full Stop.\n\nYou are right that wife needs to set boundaries, but you did open this door when you started explaining your medical situation. If your MIL wants more information she can call you directly and you can tell her that you have shared all you want to share.  It isn't on your wife to share your story with mom, or to tell her mom not to bother you.  Everyone is an adult in this situation.  You all get to ask for what you want, and you all get to deny another from acquiescing to their requests. \n\nNow that the situation is where it is, you and the wife should be working together on how best to not end up here in the future.", "NTA. It would\u2019ve helped though to know beforehand that her mother was like that. MIL is the AH and your wife should do better enforcing the boundaries. That being said you can uphold your boundary while also showing empathy for your wife. These things are easier said than done for many people.", "Somewhere between NTA and No AH. If your wife has asked you to not share sensitive information with her mother, you should have listened to her and it is not fair that your wife is paying the price for your actions. Still, it was your decision.\n\nAlso, your wife should not be sharing YOUR sensitive information, and she should tell her mother to ask you **and not answer.** \"Sorry, you should ask OP about it\" ad nauseum. Then, if Mom takes her at her word, you can revisit your decision to not be evasive to personal questions.", "YTA for info-dumping and then leaving your wife to handle it alone. You brought it up, if you want them to leave you alone, then tell them. Or maybe next time, do what your wife says and not tell nosey people that kind of stuff to start with. But don't leave her on her own to get harassed because of your actions", "Soft YTA. If you didn't want to share your health stuff with your in-laws, why throw it out there then close it down, leaving your wife to take all the flak from them. \nNTA for dwfining your boundaries but you knew what type of people they are, and you set your wife up. She's right - you should have just said you'd a headache and leave it at that. \nDefinitely TA for throwing it back on her about 'not lying just to make her life a bit more comfortable'. You're the one who made it uncomfortable by throwing something out there that you knew they'd feed on", "ESH.  You dropped a bomb on your in-laws and then expected your wife to pick up the shrapnel.  If your ADHD is so very private maybe you should not have mentioned it in the first place.  Your in-laws are now being nosy and your wife is agitated.  I'd say none of you are being particularly reasonable.", "[deleted]", "I\u2019ll go against the grain and say YTA. You created a headache for your wife while gaining absolutely nothing. In fact her parent\u2019s response is reasonable and predictable. Most parents would have concerns and would push for clarity.", "You are not an asshole but you aren't being the brightest - your mother in law does not necessarily even deserve that much info about you if she annoys you. If she bothers you and your wife, you should have put her on an information diet.\n\n if you were that open knowing that they are anti meds, then you had to know you were opening Pandora's box. Why be open with them and let your wife deal with the fallout ? You have the right to tell the world what your wish but your wife has the right to be annoyed when her mother won't shut up about it and this could have easily been avoided. In an ideal world you can tell anyone anything, but when you are married these nuances need to be thought through. Unless you and your wife are prepared to go No Contact but it sounds like you still want to have a relationship with your ML so an Info diet is mandatory.", "yta", "NTA. Your MIL sounds overbearing and she should get her nose out of your business", "Info: why wouldn\u2019t you just grey rock and say it\u2019s just a headache?", "NTA, but not sure why your wife can't just tell her mom to respect her boundaries on information and if she keeps prying she'll be trusted with even less information.", ">While I greatly commend you on NOT lying to MIL\n\nHe absolutely could have just said \"I'm fine, it's just a headache\" and left it at that, most people wouldn't ask why he has a headache. There was no need to go on about his new phychiatrist and how his meds affect him in a pretty significant way. It rather sounds like he wanted his ILs to be curious/concerned as he does his \"I won't tell\"-bit while his wife is stuck in the middle.", "unfortunately her family is very very anti medication and all about holistic health and healing, so any time any one goes on medication, they think the person needs to be practically dying to justify it", "Well, I have asked that before (in a nicer way), and she usually says that it's a cultural difference, and that they are used to being in a society that overshares and tell each other everything. Also, her parents have always been SUPER controlling.\n\nI have been trying to work on building up her confidence to push back a bit more, but it takes time. I'm just worried if we cave or live in fear forever, when we have kids it will be an absolute nightmare", "I really didn't mean to snap at her. I was outside a client event speaking to her about this and we kept talking in circles and I just was trying to make my side of things clear. I get it though", "I'm not sure how I \"left her alone\" or what I could have done differently. She got the call about it days later, and I did tell her that if her parents had any questions about it they could aske me directly.", "Op didn\u2019t bring it up. His wife asked what was wrong then his in laws. He answered honestly.", "lol \"a bomb on them\"? nah, he's under no obligation to tell more than he wants to. ADHD is extremely common and it doesn't effect their life in any way, it is not a 'bomb' unless you are looking for an excuse to cause drama.", "I have told them I have ADHD before, so they knew before then. It's not private that I have it, I just don't like going into crazy detail about it (which they also know)", "That's what I initially said to my wife when she asked, my adhd response was in response to her mother's follow up. I normally don't disclose much, but I had a headache, didn't feel like lying and was trying to get them to not ask all the questions concerning my headache to try to figure out what i did wrong and try to fix it.", "well, at the time i was having a migraine, not thinking entirely straight, and I basically thought if I said that, they would want to try to fix it somehow so they would keep asking questions and suggesting things. I really just wanted to say what was happening and get it over with so they would leave me alone a bit. and in my migraine rattled mind, that seemed like the thing to say. which, it worked.", "Sure, but if someone says they\u2019re taking new meds for ADHD, then that\u2019s that. No one is entitled to know anything more than that. And the fact that the ILs are not only pushing for more information, but solely asking their daughter and not talking to OP themselves is the issue.", "Well then they can drink some herbal tea and meditate on minding their own business.", "i don't think you're an AH but I do wonder why you opened up about your meds and stuff knowing that her mom is against that sort of thing. just seems like you knew her mom is gonna be obnoxious about it... best to limit the info you tell her about your health issues.", "I think this should have been part of your main post as this is a key factor. It's not just standard concern or curiosity. It'll be something your MIL will fully focus on. \nYou've set your wife up to take the brunt of this when you knew it would be a contentious issue. \nSo you opened the door and left your wife to close it.\nI agree you don't need to tell anyone more about your meds than they need to know but you've clearly left your wife in the shit here with no support or back story.\n\nHope she can hold the fort for you. You realise this won't stop right. The mil will not stop given the nature of this issue.\n\nHope your wife holds out. You've certainly set her up to fail. She will be subject to constant questioning over a very very long time and  she'll be the one to blame if she drops an answer or else force her to lie. Will it be all her fault  if that happens? \n\nSeriously take some part here in how you've set up these circs for your wife. The questions aren't going to stop. \n\nYes if she's doing the right thing she will simply continue to hold up your story and refuse to say more but I can see after a long period something may slip. \n\nI don't think you can fully ignore your part in this if this happens.", "Oh good I can\u2019t wait to hear how spinach juice will cure your neurodiversity lol", "They need to brew themselves a steaming cup of \u201cmind their own damn business\u201d and follow that up with a tincture of \u201cget back in their own lane\u201d.", "Your wife needs to make a decision about all this, because this isn't only about her anymore.

I just got upset and frustrated when she was trying to force me to tell her parents more than I wanted to and implying that I am the only one that did something wrong in the situation. \n\nI've been dealing with her parent's nosiness since I met my wife and been tip toeing around about what we should and should not tell them. I just don't like being treated like the bad guy because in one instance I said something that for a normal adult should not have created drama.\n\nFor example: if my in laws ask if we want to attend an event (such as a last minute religious ceremony in someone's home, out of state or even in another country), if my reaction is \"no, I don't want to make the trip (usually atleast a 2 or 3 hour drive for the most basic plans), and we have plans with friends that day anyway\", my wife will tell them that I'm going to be out of state that day for work and there's no way we could make it. Just to avoid having to explain our justification for not wanting to drive 4-6 hours round trip for someone's random event, and ALSO, her parents would then question what friends we have plans with and why we can't cancel them. \n\nI'm not a fan of lying to begin with, and I don't like having to lie just to avoid other's inappropriate reactions and response", "He's not.
