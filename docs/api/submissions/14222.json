Eventually, my wife asks me what's wrong, so I respond that I have a bit of a headache and can't tell if it's a migraine or not.\n\nMy MIL, in the back seat, asks me if everything is okay, to which I truthfully reply \"I think I'm fine, I am just trying out some new meds my psychiatrist recommended for my ADHD and I'm still getting used to making sure I eat at the right times and avoid my typical amount of coffee, so I think that might be causing my headache.\" It's important to note I was initially diagnosed a year ago, and just started taking meds a month ago. After we drop off my inlaws and we are alone in the car again, my wife asks me why I told her parents what I did, and I should have just lied and told them I had a headache and don't know why.\n\nMy response to this was \"I don't like lying to your parents about things i shouldn't need to lie about. I told them the truth, and as much of it as I felt comfortable telling.\"\n\nNOW, the part where I may be a bit of an AH. A few days later, while away on business, i get a call from my wife, complaining to me that her mother has been on the phone with her for 45 minutes trying to grill her about my ADHD, meds and what was happening, wanting to know the reason, when it all started, etc. Wife starts to get mad at me saying she knew I shouldn't have said anything and now her mom won't leave her alone about it. My response to this was simple. \"I told your parents about what was happening at that time, and shared all I felt like sharing about what was going on. It's on them to respect that\".\n\nWife: \"you should just tell them about it and share why you're on meds so they leave me alone\".\n\nI don't want to share that, it's an extremely personal side effect of my ADHD and the meds have really helped, but I don't want to share it, especially with my in laws.\n\nMe: \"I don't want to share that, and you know why. I'm not changing my mind on that. tell your parents I'll share what I feel comfortable with, when I feel comfortable with and to leave it alone\"\n\nWife: \"they won't listen and will just keep bothering me. Just tell them so they feel better and I don't have to deal with this\"\n\nMe: \"It's not my fault that your parents don't respect boundaries and that you haven't enforced them enough to listen when you try to. That's on you and your mother. Not me because I decided not to lie. What I say and when about my meds is up to me, and I'm not telling them shit just to make your life a bit easier and them more comfortable.\"\n\nWife has been agitated about it since, and occasionally drops hints her mom is mad I don't want to share more. So. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Since the level of headache I had at this time became a source of debate in the comments, I will clarify. The \"bit of a headache\" was a turn of phrase and not an accurate description of the headache i had. It was a Migraine. I was experiencing enough symptoms and pain that if it had gotten any worse I would have pulled over and asked my wife to drive.

You are under NO obligation to speak about any of your medical stuff with your ILs unless YOU choose to.", "I don\u2019t think you are the asshole in all honesty. You have your right to your privacy and to share what you are comfortable with. It sounds to me like they do not know how to respect boundaries. Yeah man you\u2019re good on this one.", "NTA- its your private medical business and your in laws are violating your boundaries. Do not let them pressure you into sharing more than you want, also not sure what else they wanna know, they already know you have ADHD and take meds. People saying YTA are completely brushing over the fact that your in-laws and extended family are not entitled to know everything about your medical history, even if they are family and mean well. And even if you already shared some info. There is a\nlot of stigma that surrounds mental health and medication, especially for men so if you don\u2019t wanna subject yourself to that it is your choice and its understandable. I feel for your wife, but she needs to put her foot down and set boundaries with her mother otherwise this will just keep on manifesting in other areas of your life with your in-laws feeling entitled to know about your personal matters.", "ESH - You're both communicating poorly.\n\nLet me rephrase the issue - you wife is asking you to stop discussing things where you want to limit info because her mom takes any discussion as an invitation to pry, and then SHE has to manage her mom's prying. Stop sharing info with your MIL, limiting responses is not lying.\n\n>and occasionally drops hints her mom is mad I don't want to share more\n\nShe's telling you about it because she has to hear about it - you have made it her problem to manage her mom's inappropriate boundaries.", "Probably ESH, but maybe NTA.  If you know your MIL is going to act this way, keeping her on an information diet is the best for you and your wife.  You aren't lying by saying you have a headache and you don't want to come off as cranky. Full Stop.\n\nYou are right that wife needs to set boundaries, but you did open this door when you started explaining your medical situation. If your MIL wants more information she can call you directly and you can tell her that you have shared all you want to share.  It isn't on your wife to share your story with mom, or to tell her mom not to bother you.  Everyone is an adult in this situation.  You all get to ask for what you want, and you all get to deny another from acquiescing to their requests. \n\nNow that the situation is where it is, you and the wife should be working together on how best to not end up here in the future.", "NTA. It would\u2019ve helped though to know beforehand that her mother was like that. MIL is the AH and your wife should do better enforcing the boundaries. That being said you can uphold your boundary while also showing empathy for your wife. These things are easier said than done for many people.", "Somewhere between NTA and No AH. If your wife has asked you to not share sensitive information with her mother, you should have listened to her and it is not fair that your wife is paying the price for your actions. Still, it was your decision.\n\nAlso, your wife should not be sharing YOUR sensitive information, and she should tell her mother to ask you **and not answer.** \"Sorry, you should ask OP about it\" ad nauseum. Then, if Mom takes her at her word, you can revisit your decision to not be evasive to personal questions.", "YTA for info-dumping and then leaving your wife to handle it alone.

If you didn't want to share your health stuff with your in-laws, why throw it out there then close it down, leaving your wife to take all the flak from them. \nNTA for dwfining your boundaries but you knew what type of people they are, and you set your wife up. She's right - you should have just said you'd a headache and leave it at that. \nDefinitely TA for throwing it back on her about 'not lying just to make her life a bit more comfortable'. You're the one who made it uncomfortable by throwing something out there that you knew they'd feed on", "ESH.  You dropped a bomb on your in-laws and then expected your wife to pick up the shrapnel.

I'd say none of you are being particularly reasonable.", "[deleted]", "I\u2019ll go against the grain and say YTA. You created a headache for your wife while gaining absolutely nothing.

If she bothers you and your wife, you should have put her on an information diet.\n\n if you were that open knowing that they are anti meds, then you had to know you were opening Pandora's box. Why be open with them and let your wife deal with the fallout ? You have the right to tell the world what your wish but your wife has the right to be annoyed when her mother won't shut up about it and this could have easily been avoided. In an ideal world you can tell anyone anything, but when you are married these nuances need to be thought through.

It rather sounds like he wanted his ILs to be curious/concerned as he does his \"I won't tell\"-bit while his wife is stuck in the middle.", "unfortunately her family is very very anti medication and all about holistic health and healing, so any time any one goes on medication, they think the person needs to be practically dying to justify it", "Well, I have asked that before (in a nicer way), and she usually says that it's a cultural difference, and that they are used to being in a society that overshares and tell each other everything. Also, her parents have always been SUPER controlling.\n\nI have been trying to work on building up her confidence to push back a bit more, but it takes time.

His wife asked what was wrong then his in laws. He answered honestly.", "lol \"a bomb on them\"? nah, he's under no obligation to tell more than he wants to.

It's not private that I have it, I just don't like going into crazy detail about it (which they also know)", "That's what I initially said to my wife when she asked, my adhd response was in response to her mother's follow up. I normally don't disclose much, but I had a headache, didn't feel like lying and was trying to get them to not ask all the questions concerning my headache to try to figure out what i did wrong and try to fix it.", "well, at the time i was having a migraine, not thinking entirely straight, and I basically thought if I said that, they would want to try to fix it somehow so they would keep asking questions and suggesting things. I really just wanted to say what was happening and get it over with so they would leave me alone a bit. and in my migraine rattled mind, that seemed like the thing to say. which, it worked.", "Sure, but if someone says they\u2019re taking new meds for ADHD, then that\u2019s that. No one is entitled to know anything more than that. And the fact that the ILs are not only pushing for more information, but solely asking their daughter and not talking to OP themselves is the issue.", "Well then they can drink some herbal tea and meditate on minding their own business.", "i don't think you're an AH but I do wonder why you opened up about your meds and stuff knowing that her mom is against that sort of thing. just seems like you knew her mom is gonna be obnoxious about it... best to limit the info you tell her about your health issues.", "I think this should have been part of your main post as this is a key factor.

They're grilling for information because they obviously don't want you on ADHD meds and will probably cook up some holistic solution based on details of your experiences. \n\nYou and your wife need to tell them that you guys (or just you, idk your wife's stance) are pro medicine and medical treatment, and that is that. You don't want their diagnosis. You don't want their suggestions on alternative treatments. Your doctor knows the facts, and you trust his medical decisions for your treatment. \n\nBoundaries do play a part in that, but they're only sticking their noses in it because they obviously disagree with your handling of your care and are going to find a crunchy way to deal with it.", "YTA.  Why did you share all these details in the car with your inlaws?  Too much information.  You could have just gave them the same answer you gave your wife: \"I have a headache\".  That's all you needed to say.  You knew they are anti medication, but you had to tell them about your condition and medication. You are the one who opened this can of worms, and your wife is the one who has to deal with it.  Sure, your wife could tell them to shut up, mind their f*cking business, and never ask again.  But, the point is, you should not have put her in the position of having to do that to begin with.  Keep your private crap private.", "NAH but it's close. Personally OP I think there's a huge difference between lying and just omitting information. You've learned from this incident that some people can't handle any form of details--with those type of people it's best to \"grey rock\" and give out as little information as possible. It would be an A-H move to keep telling her parents things in the future that they can't handle because she has to deal with all the problems that arise from it.\n\nYour wife already knew about greyrocking (well, sort of. She knew they couldn't handle it because she grew up with them) but her A-H move was continuing to push for you to handle this instead of her.\n\nYall should come together.

If you don't want to talk about it, the correct move is to not fucking talk about it.", "ESH. Her parents and her more, but it sounds like her mom has a history of boundary pushing and information seeking. This is a time when you exacerbated things unnecessarily. Your in-laws don't need to know the ins and outs of your medical history, and I feel like knowing your mother-in-law as you do, you knew she would take the bait-- medications, psychiatrist... Those are all pretty irresistible words to someone who wants to know everything. Saying you had a headache would not be the end of the world.", "ESH - Saying \u201cI don\u2019t know why I have a headache\u201d wasn\u2019t a lie. \u201cI THINK\u201d it\u2019s because yada yada is inviting commentary.  It\u2019s similar to vague-booking, saying something intentionally vague and then protesting that it\u2019s highly personal.\nSounds like you intentionally put your wife in a bad spot, since you already knew how her mom feels about such things. Why don\u2019t you just call MIL and tell her what you told your wife?", "NTA. Your MIL is too nosey for her own good. The \u201c truth\u201d opened a can of worms. That\u2019s what white lies are for.", "ESH. Your wife needs to have better boundaries with her pushy family, but you also opened to the door by volunteering more info than was needed, knowing full well that your in laws would have something to say about it. Your wife is asking for backup on this, and instead, you're telling her to enforce a boundary on information that you volunteered. This honestly sounds like you were trying to goad your in laws into saying something about being on meds, but instead of saying something to you, they're going after their daughter.", "NTA But your wife is 100% going to tell her mother your details, so be prepared. The moment it seems like they\u2019ve backed off, that\u2019s when she told her.", "NTA\n\nYour wife needs to learn to enforce boundaries.", "NTA. You\u2019re exactly right. MIL needs to respect boundaries and your wife should respect them as well.", "NTA.\n\nOkay so I have ADHD too. And I have it pretty severely so I was diagnosed when I was not even in elementary school.\nSo first of all having ADHD on a level where you take meds means it isn't unnoticeably. So usually your in-laws should know about some of your symptoms already. Then, ADHD is like a very complex thing and I would argue that it influences your whole person. It's not like you can say that this specific thing is my ADHD and nothing is influenced by it expect this. \nSo, for you to say 'hey, my meds are new and I need some time getting used to it' is not such a unique thing. If someone had heart problems and took meds, them saying this wouldn't cause such surprise. \n\nIf your in-laws don't know about ADHD - no problem. Learning about the condition and how it affects people could be something you do together. I imagine you did some research, why not share it with them. There are lots of books about this.\nAlso, if you have children, it's very likely that they have ADHD too.\n\nSo in general I get very discriminating vibes from your in-laws. You having ADHD isn't such a big deal. It's not like you ate something bad and suddenly your brain re-wired. You always had it but you weren't in a position where you could have it diagnosed. From my experience you probably struggled at school and never reached your full potential before. Your wife should stick for you and call out the discriminating tendencies in her mother's questions and attitude. She also should help her to understand the issue as her behaviour might be motivated by a lack of knowledge and experience. \n\nI find it very weird that you should lie about such a very important part of your daily life? Like I for example am pretty open and up-front about it because for the average person I am simply a lot of energy and people are often put off about it. But then I try to explain this and they can understand me in this framework better. Like before I was weird and now it's not weird and a mystery, they know why I am a bit more loud and energetic as the usual person. And they know I can't help it but try my best and not because I am an attention-seeking b*tch.\n\nOkay I feel that I digress completely here (lol) so Imma stop here. But yeah, NTA.", "NTA. I hope you don\u2019t have children. I can imagine what a fight it would be to take a child to the doctor. A friends brother has a child with hearing loss because the wife would not allow the child to take meds for multiple ear infections. Everything has to be holistic. I do believe there is a place and purpose for holistic medicine but you can\u2019t totally ignore traditional medicine with certain situations. Take your meds, be proud, and dont share any more info with them! F all of them!", "Your wife does indeed need to learn to set and maintain boundaries. NTA", "Wow - your wife is way out of line! She should absolutely not be demanding you to get her own mom off her back! Is she always this helpless? She is perfectly capable of telling her mom to mind her own business or not taking her calls, she shouldn't even be mentioning any of this to you!", "NTA - The only AH is the MIL in this case.  I am reading your wife's mind here, but I think she knew how her Mother would react and was frustrated about that, not actually about what you said.  She did take it out on you, but take it as a teachable moment from her.  Having said that, you didn't do anything wrong and your wife needs to set some boundaries with her mother.", " *\"they won't listen and will just keep bothering me. Just tell them so they feel better and I don't have to deal with this\"*\n\nMIL is pressuring Wife, to make Wife behave in the role of Flying Monkey.  I'm guessing that MIL has been this kind of emotional abuser for Wife's entire life, so Wife doesn't realize what is happening and doesn't have the skills to make her mother stop.  I'm guessing that Wife learned long ago to just comply with MIL's demands and pressures and hints, to avoid conflict and anger from her mother. Those are the survival skills of an abused child.  But your wife isn't a child now, and it's a good time for her to learn different skills, and to unlearn the old survival skills that now are harming her more.\n\n*Wife has been agitated about it since,* \n\nYep.  Because she's been taught to fix things, and she can't make you compliant.  Good. \n\n*and occasionally drops hints her mom is mad I don't want to share more.* \n\nEmotionally abused kids, and adults, are taught that the responsibilities of the abuser are their responsibility.  So, your Wife thinks that she, and you, are supposed to fix this situation and make her mother feel better, and appease this anger.  MIL is reinforcing this, with every conversation.  Manipulators and abusers like this, they want to win, because if they don't, you learn that you can stand up to them.  And they lose control.   \n\n*So. AITA?*\n\nNTA.  You told them enough for them to give you compassion and respect.  Which they should.  It's MIL that's being TA here, pressuring your wife. \n\nSend your wife over to r/raisedbynarcissists to help her learn how to stop complying with her mother's demands, and how her mother's demands are emotional abuse.  \n\nCheck out r/JUSTNOMIL or r/motherinlawsfromhell, for yourself. \n\nA start: \n\n1. \"Mom, **I'm not talking about this** with you again.\"  \n2. \"Mom, **I told you I'm not discussing this.**  If you bring it up again, this visit/call is over.\" \n3. **\"Bye mom.\"  She hangs up, or walks out,**  and blocks or ignores mom for the day.  If mom shows up at the door, she doesn't answer.  It's hard.  **It's devastating the first few times** to do this. But it's MIL that is wrong in her behavior here, and your wife needs to learn that.  It's not rude to not answer the door when someone is trying to force your compliance to their invasive demands.  It's protecting herself, and you, from a manipulator/abuser.  \n4. Next day, first text, she sends the same message.  \"Not discussing this.\"  If mom won't behavior, ignore/block again.  This time, a couple days.  Repeat as needed, every time MIL won't leave it alone, a longer time between contact.  \n5. If mom will talk about other things, great.  When she brings this up, it's **one warning for maybe the first three times they talk, then an exit immediately** after that.  Even on holidays or birthdays.  \"Mom, I told you no.  This call/visit is over.  Bye.\"   \n6. If it's at your house, she can lock herself in a room and let you escort them out, if she can't handle it yet, which is understandable.  If they won't leave, you call the police to make them.  At that point, they make it clear that they want control over your home and you make it calmly just as clear, that isn't happening. \n7. Every time she brings this up, \"not discussing it, bye.\"\n8. Same thing for any flying monkeys.  \"Mom is being rude and invasive and wants all of OP's medical details, which is not happening.  She won't accept this and is being mean to me about it.\"  \"Mom won't accept that our decisions about our life are ours to make, and not hers to demand more information about.\" \"I'm not discussing this.\" \n9. Therapy, with someone who is trained for this kind of thing.\n\nThis isn't cruel.  It's not punishment.  **It's protecting yourselves** from a manipulative abuser who wants to know everything and demands information that is private.  **MIL is abusing your wife.**  MIL is wrong.  **Your wife needs to learn the new skills** to stop passing on that behavior towards you, **to stop complying with MIL and acting as MIL's enabler.**  If your wife **wants to learn** these new skills, she can.  My spouse and I did, in our forties, with lots of tears and many long discussions, but we didn't have reddit back then to help.  It's hard.  And it's new and scary.  And it's possible.   We, at first, wrote out what to say, and helped each other say it by pointing to the next line that could work.
