I support various youth in various age groups with various mental health challenges and with different cognitive capacities. Part of my position to to occasionally drive my youth to visits with family, appointments with therapists or other professionals. \n\nNow to the story, My long distance Best friend (F26) and I have known eachother for over 20 years. So childhood friends, recently she asked me to order her something from Amazon as I have prime and she does not. I offered instead of etransfering me she could instead send me something off my wish list, since she had a gift card anyways. Well she did and also added something on top as a \"little gift\" well when the package arrived I found a car decal that read \"Hot Girls Hit Curbs\" in bright pink letters. It was funny but not something I would put on my car, I'm not really into Car Decals, Ive had people buy them for me previously. Usually around me being a dog mom or that my dogs rescued me etc. and have not added any of them yet. Which she is aware of as we usually discuss gifts people have given us. When i saw the decal, I laughed and thanked her. To which she replied \"I expect this to be on the back of your car and a picture to me by the end of the day. It'll be your first offical car decal\". I politely declined and explained for various reasons that I wouldn't want this decal on my car, including my current job role and the way I'd be perceived by my youth, my employees, colleagues and other professionals. Additionally my car is a shared vehicle with my long term partner of 7 years and I don't think they would appreciate the decal either. She immediately got defensive stating \"It's not that big of a deal\", \"Its just a joke\" and \"If you partner is sensitive about something like this then are you sure you even want to be with them\". I was floored by this response. I appreciate the sentiment but this is something that just isn't my style and I value the way I'm precieved in my professional life and because of my youths cognitive capacities they may take this literally and refuse to ride with me. I tried to expalin this but was met with \"You're making this a bigger deal than what it is\" \nWe changed the topic but I now I'm wondering, AITA?", "created_utc": 1697223813, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/177634x/aita_for_refusing_to_put_a_car_decal_on_my_car/", "score": 335, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't put stickers or anything identifying on my car.  I do put them on my water bottle, with a magnet on my fridge or even on my laptop.

I don't put anything on my car. No decals, no magnets, no bumper stickers, no funny license plate holders, no window stickers, nothing. I don't have any dealer adverts. It's your car.

I've had similar jobs so I confidently say any decal suggesting you're not a good driver would not be appreciated by the agency nor the youth's parents. Maybe explain it to your friend from that perspective. Ask her how she'd feel if the professional driving her child around had a decal about hitting curbs.\n\n2.

Unfortunately the likelihood of getting tailgated and harassed goes up.", "NTA: Skip all of the other reasons, that is a major security and safety concern.  \nThe decal is an easy to spot target in traffic and life, and could easily allow someone to learn your routes and habits without you being able to even suspect their existence until it was too late.", "NTA it was a cute idea, but the prank goes too far when it puts you in danger", "Tape it onto the car, take a pic and then toss it", "Get some tape, tape it on,  take the picture,  take it off.   \nNTA", "stick it to the underside of the car and send her a picture of that", "NTA.

Lots of people don't like decals on their cars. It kind of makes you a target (for various reasons), and if someone disagrees with you, they may vandalize your vehicle (not in this case-I'm thinking political decals etc.). It's a cute idea, but due to your profession & personal taste, you don't want it on your car.  That does not make you an asshole.", "Nope. NTA", "This is why I have a water bottle for stickers. People were always giving me decals and stickers. I use my water bottle way more than my car", "NTA. Demanding that someone put a sticker on their car is super pushy.", "Nope nope nope. I *refuse* to have decals on my car. When I bought my car those jackasses slapped their dealership sticker on it and I had my husband out there taking it off with a heat gun on New Years Day (bought it on the 31st.) No one gets to put stickers on my car, not even my husband, which honestly kind of annoys him because he for some weird reason wants to change the color of the Chevy sign to pink for me - that's a hard \"no\" too. Don't give in!", "NTA. She sent it as a joke, you laughed. She doesn't get to dictate how you decorate your car, especially since some people, including me, would find it offensive.", "NTA.  If it isn't such a big deal, they don't need to be pushing you to put the thing on your car.", "NTA. I hate car decals. I won't even let the dealership put their sticker on a car I am buying (I ain't advertising for them without getting paid). I did finally cave and put a very small decal on my current car to cover a paint chip on my bumper. But it is blue writing on a clear background and my car is blue. It is very subtle and I have no interest in adding more. Some people are decal people and some people aren't and the friend needs to build a bridge and get over herself.", "Nope, just stick it on your luggage. It will make your luggage easier for you to spot.", "I have a friend like this. I would bet that as \u201cbest friend status\u201d she feels like she should know you better and you not using her gift makes it look like she doesn\u2019t know you as well as she thinks she does so you\u2019re making her look bad. Now she can\u2019t tell people she broke you from your anti-sticker vendetta because she\u2019s your best friend and knew she could do it. It\u2019s a weird point of pride sometimes.", "NTA.  \"I don't put decals on my car\" is explanation enough.  If she is your friend, she should respect that. The only person making an unneccessary Big Deal about it is her.", "This is where you stick it on the car, send the photo, and then immediately take it off.  Keep the peace, easy.", "Had a roommate with the sticker \u201c ex boyfriend in trunk\u201d. I hated borrowing her car!

And when your vehicle is part of your job, ditto.", "What you put on your car is like what you would tattoo on your body. It's personal. I don't put anything cute or political on my vehicles.
