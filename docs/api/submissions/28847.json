So childhood friends, recently she asked me to order her something from Amazon as I have prime and she does not. I offered instead of etransfering me she could instead send me something off my wish list, since she had a gift card anyways. Well she did and also added something on top as a \"little gift\" well when the package arrived I found a car decal that read \"Hot Girls Hit Curbs\" in bright pink letters. It was funny but not something I would put on my car, I'm not really into Car Decals, Ive had people buy them for me previously. Usually around me being a dog mom or that my dogs rescued me etc. and have not added any of them yet. Which she is aware of as we usually discuss gifts people have given us. When i saw the decal, I laughed and thanked her. To which she replied \"I expect this to be on the back of your car and a picture to me by the end of the day. It'll be your first offical car decal\". I politely declined and explained for various reasons that I wouldn't want this decal on my car, including my current job role and the way I'd be perceived by my youth, my employees, colleagues and other professionals. Additionally my car is a shared vehicle with my long term partner of 7 years and I don't think they would appreciate the decal either. She immediately got defensive stating \"It's not that big of a deal\", \"Its just a joke\" and \"If you partner is sensitive about something like this then are you sure you even want to be with them\". I was floored by this response. I appreciate the sentiment but this is something that just isn't my style and I value the way I'm precieved in my professional life and because of my youths cognitive capacities they may take this literally and refuse to ride with me. I tried to expalin this but was met with \"You're making this a bigger deal than what it is\" \nWe changed the topic but I now I'm wondering, AITA?", "created_utc": 1697223813, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/177634x/aita_for_refusing_to_put_a_car_decal_on_my_car/", "score": 1032, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When I bought my car those jackasses slapped their dealership sticker on it and I had my husband out there taking it off with a heat gun on New Years Day (bought it on the 31st.)

I won't even let the dealership put their sticker on a car I am buying (I ain't advertising for them without getting paid). I did finally cave and put a very small decal on my current car to cover a paint chip on my bumper. But it is blue writing on a clear background and my car is blue.

Hell I aim to use the full lane width, making the best but still street legal use of entry, apex and exit points to carry as much speed and be as smooth as possible.
