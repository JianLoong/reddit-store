That if she did ever date someone black her dad would disown her, kick her out and cut all contact permanently. She told me her mom isn\u2019t \u201creally\u201d like that though whatever that means.  \n\nAfter she initially told me this I told her that her parents were racist which she didn\u2019t take well and she assured me that they weren\u2019t but I really didn\u2019t make to big of a deal of it although I disagreed. \n\nFast forward to about a year ago she told her mom we were dating and from my understanding basically got her mom to convince her dad to be ok with idea of her dating a black guy. \n\nI was glad for her because ik she had been concerned about the whole thing for a while but I was still kinda put off by the fact that he was so against it and had to be convinced.  \n\nLately my gf has been asking me about meeting her parents and bringing it up a lot and although I agreed I\u2019ve been putting it off and avoiding it. She asked me why I was putting it off because she could tell and I told her that I honestly am not interested in meeting her family. I told her some of the stuff you told me sounded kinda racist and I don\u2019t think I would have a good interaction with people who would consider disowning you over my skin color. \n\nShe got mad and told me to stop calling her family racist which I was careful not say originally and then we kinda dropped the conversation as it was getting heated. AITA for not wanting to meet them? I know at some point I will have to but I\u2019m just not looking forward to it tbh. \n\nEdit: I wanted to note as well my girlfriends family is Egyptian not white and they are also immigrants. Their when family including her younger brother all came about 11 years ago from Egypt. Not that it\u2019s an excuse but they are a lot more traditional and religious where she is from and her parents also aren\u2019t the best English speakers so a meeting would probably consist of a lot of talking in a language I don\u2019t speak and my gf translating.", "created_utc": 1670681616, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zhtjr1/aita_for_not_wanting_to_meet_my_girlfriends/", "score": 133, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one wants to be uncomfortable and you truly don't know what his reaction will be.  You live in the US, you are going to feel some racism no matter where you go unfortunately.  You will need to learn to face it as  I'm sure you have.

Your girlfriend is delusional and very apathetic to your experiences. Edit: NTA", "I keep seeing people saying that you should give it a try because you need to see how it goes, and that's bs. No one who is a part of a minority group has any obligation to put themselves in a situation where they have reason to expect discrimination. If my partner's family were antisemitic, or had made it clear that they hold antisemitic views I would not be obligated to go around them. A partner who actually cares about you would understand that and not force the issue. NTA", "I would say ESH but I can't because I don't believe your GF sucks. Yea, dad is probably racist, but people can change. YTA because you're not at least willing to try and see how it goes.
