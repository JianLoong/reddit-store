I greatly appreciate all of your insight. From the dms to the internet mom/dads It\u2019s very affirming and I am starting school this summer! I\u2019m going to set boundaries w my parents and let them know I am one call away and will be in daily contact them  change is hard but necessary for my growth.\n\nI (24F) am an only child and live with my mom (52) and Dad (64).\n\nI have graduated college and have been working in my field for 2 years and have recently gotten accepted to medical school out of state. I always wanted to go into medicine but took some time off to build my application and also make some money. My parents have always known this and have supported me during college and encouraged me to pursue my dreams as I am the first one in my family to graduate college and pursue graduate school- this really means alot to me. \n\nHowever after graduating, my mom started making comments on how she feels like she needs me to stay in state to help her and my dad. Today she comes in and starts crying that I should give up medical school and stay close by to care for my dad/mom as they are getting old. This has been building up a while this past year and today she has been guilting me for \"leaving them\".\n\nI told her that while I understand the situation that I am an only child BUT I cant just keep my life on hold to care for them. She said I was not a good child and \"you never know about life/death\".\n\nI feel like shit, I am tired of the constant nagging. I have been seeking therapy to navigate this as its been bothering me alot. I feel guilty to leaving my family but also want to make something of my life. I dont want to give up my dreams. \n\nShe said I should not go to med school OOS and try to reapply and stay close to home. I said I will not do that and dont want to be stuck being a caretaker for the rest of my life. I want to live my own journey. \n\nMy whole life I stayed close to my parents to please them and make them comfortable. I went to a university closer to home even tho I got in to a better school out of state. I decided to move back and stay at home post grad even when I could afford my own apartment and live on my own. I hate being an only child at times. I really wish I had siblings. \n\nI feel guilty as fuck for going to med school. I also feel guilty for \"leaving\" my parents behind. i cant win. \n\nBoth parents are able bodied and healthy- they just get tired. Also they are well financially and can easily afford a day nurse if needed (which they don\u2019t becaue they r fine) and have a cleaning service.", "created_utc": 1682985578, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1355kfb/aita_for_telling_my_parents_as_an_only_child_i/", "score": 424, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Always fiercely independent I knew she would be fine. Even in a new state. She had to move in with her boyfriend and his parents at their home because of the state jump she did. That was fine. Though when she left it was not the easiest for me as her mom I handled it and let her go knowing I was her safety net.  Now she just bought her first house at 20 and on an income she made completely by herself starting her own business. They actually just moved in last weekend. I could not be more proud of her and even her boyfriend for all they have done. Now his mother had to watch as her son packed up his room and moved out and she is not handling it well. Basically trying to guilt trip him into staying in their severely over crowded house because \u201cshe is not ready to lose him yet\u201d, context they moved five streets away and maybe a 10 minute drive. She called me to complain about them moving out on short notice and that I should support her and her loss. I validated her feelings but told her something no parent really ever wants to hear and it is something that your mom also needs to hear, when we become parents our life changes. We become someone who raises and nurtures the next generation of people. It is an honor but a double edged sword. We love, guide, and hopefully get to watch as the little people we brought into the world become something great. It is our job to raise them to the best we can and it is their job to grow up and leave us. \nI hope your mother stops soon. She must have done something right.

If mom is 52 and needs OP to skip me school and care for her, there's something seriously wrong and she needs a thorough check up. My mom is 90 and just moved to assisted living from being in her own home, alone, for several years since my dad passed away.

My Asian mom harangued me for DECADES to become a doctor so she could have a doctor child to brag about to her cabal of friends. It got to the point where I refused to even consider it just on principle. Then I started working in hospitals (as part of my original career plan) and realized I actually liked medicine. It took me another few years after that to decide if I really wanted medicine, or if it was just my mother\u2019s voice in my head. I ended up going to med school, and once I got there, it turned out all my mother wanted was for me to *marry* a doctor. After all the money my parents shelled out for my expensive, private education, she told me I was \u201ctoo educated\u201d and just needed to get married. \n\nI ended up dropping out of med school due to complications from breast cancer (at 29! [Know your lemons!](https://knowyourlemons.org)). She still holds it against me. There is no satisfying these parents. There will always be something for them to use to emotionally bludgeon you into staying close to take care of them. \n\nIf there is one thing that cancer taught me, it\u2019s that you only get one life. You need to get out and experience life on your own terms. Your mother may have regrets for marrying someone so much older and now worry that she will have to bear the burden of caretaking, but that was *her* choice. Don\u2019t sacrifice yourself on the altar of familial obligation when your parents are both able-bodied and relatively young.", "That makes sense. When your dad turned 60, your mom was only 48 and she suddenly felt the entirety of the 12 years separating them. \n\nNeither of your parents is old now, but it sounds like your parents have always had issues letting you go and your dad\u2019s turning 60 forced your mom to face the likelihood that she will outlive him, most likely. She might always have raised a fuss about you leaving home, but your dad\u2019s turning 60 forced her to face the possibility of being alone. Trying to make you give up school to be a stay-at-home parent makes total sense if your mom does not want to be alone: Being a traditional SAHM means that you will have kids and thus she will have grandkids as soon as possible so that she\u2019ll never risk being alone.\n\nIt\u2019s selfish on your mom\u2019s behalf\u2014She needs to navigate her own feelings about mortality and handle those feelings with your dad. They\u2019re both fairly young still! Your mom is prematurely aging both of them in a desperate attempt to keep you home.\n\nGo to school. Your mom is an adult.

It's all about the me, me, me and bragging rights about you.\n\nMy mother actually tried to do something similar.  She was rather upset when I chose to study something in the medical field and told me a friend of a friend of a friend of my aunts went to jail over helping someone needing first aid on the street..... um that's a lie and it's called the good samaritan act where regardless of occupation you can't be prosecuted because you helped someone that needed it from a first aid perspective.\n\nThen I moved 4 hours away when I graduated.  She pretended she wanted to move to where I was but never actually wanted to do anything about it.  Now she's in a nursing home due to the strokes she's had that she didn't do anything about till it was too late to have a better outcome.  That nursing home is 4 hours away.  Ironically my aunt didn't want her at a nursing home close to where I was because that would be too far from her... okay... and my mom wanted the best of both worlds but I'm not moving back and she knew that.  She's only 73 too and her first major stroke was about 4 years ago.\n\nBut I'm only a couple of years older than your mother and no way would I ever say something like that to one of my kids.  I want them to spread their wings and make their mark on the world where ever that may be.  They are not my care plan if I need it.\n\nSo follow your dreams and do what you need to do.  Don't pause your life to stay where you are.  You are not obligated to care for your parents either in the nurse like way with 24/7 care.

They had and raised their kids, for their KIDS to be happy. They want me to do whatever makes me happy, and if that meant a huge thing that would alter my future and allow me to accomplish my dreams they\u2019d be over the moon, so happy for me, and help me pack.
