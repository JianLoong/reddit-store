I greatly appreciate all of your insight. From the dms to the internet mom/dads It\u2019s very affirming and I am starting school this summer! I\u2019m going to set boundaries w my parents and let them know I am one call away and will be in daily contact them  change is hard but necessary for my growth.\n\nI (24F) am an only child and live with my mom (52) and Dad (64).\n\nI have graduated college and have been working in my field for 2 years and have recently gotten accepted to medical school out of state. I always wanted to go into medicine but took some time off to build my application and also make some money. My parents have always known this and have supported me during college and encouraged me to pursue my dreams as I am the first one in my family to graduate college and pursue graduate school- this really means alot to me. \n\nHowever after graduating, my mom started making comments on how she feels like she needs me to stay in state to help her and my dad. Today she comes in and starts crying that I should give up medical school and stay close by to care for my dad/mom as they are getting old. This has been building up a while this past year and today she has been guilting me for \"leaving them\".\n\nI told her that while I understand the situation that I am an only child BUT I cant just keep my life on hold to care for them. She said I was not a good child and \"you never know about life/death\".\n\nI feel like shit, I am tired of the constant nagging. I have been seeking therapy to navigate this as its been bothering me alot. I feel guilty to leaving my family but also want to make something of my life. I dont want to give up my dreams. \n\nShe said I should not go to med school OOS and try to reapply and stay close to home. I said I will not do that and dont want to be stuck being a caretaker for the rest of my life. I want to live my own journey. \n\nMy whole life I stayed close to my parents to please them and make them comfortable. I went to a university closer to home even tho I got in to a better school out of state. I decided to move back and stay at home post grad even when I could afford my own apartment and live on my own. I hate being an only child at times. I really wish I had siblings. \n\nI feel guilty as fuck for going to med school. I also feel guilty for \"leaving\" my parents behind. i cant win. \n\nBoth parents are able bodied and healthy- they just get tired. Also they are well financially and can easily afford a day nurse if needed (which they don\u2019t becaue they r fine) and have a cleaning service.", "created_utc": 1682985578, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1355kfb/aita_for_telling_my_parents_as_an_only_child_i/", "score": 127, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While you should absolutely do whatever you can to help your parents in times of need? It's not your responsibility to give up your life simply because they want you to take care of them\n\nThat's not fair.", "You\u2019re mother is only 52? I\u2019m 52. I\u2019m not old.  I don\u2019t feel old. I need exactly ZERO people to take care of me. \n\nBut your dad is 64? Is he an old 64? Is there maybe a health situation you don\u2019t know about? Doesn\u2019t really matter, you still get to live your life. \n\nAlso, have you pointed out how lucky your mother will be having a child who is a doctor when she does actually need a doctor?", "My mom had pancreatic cancer that killed her in less than a year and didn\u2019t ask this of any of her children (who are all older than you). That being said, I\u2019m the oldest and I quit my job and moved in to care for her, but she didn\u2019t even ask and she was facing a deadly disease. You are NTA. Go live your life!", "NTA at all. Is your father saying these things also, or is just your mom? While staying close and helping out occasionally is a normal thing to expect from you, moveing back home and demanding to put your life on pause for them is insane!!!", "NTA but are u indian? Coz indian parents guilt their children to stay with them like anything. It was hard enough for my husband and I to branch and move to a different country but I mean they made us feel so guilty. Not my parents as much, his parents a lot. But we both have realized we don't owe them anything in fact and they need to let us live our lives.\n\nOnly word of advice: stick to your plan, make something out of your life.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nListening to your parents, your best bet is to move far away.", "NTA. Your parents chose to have you, you didn\u2019t get a choice in that. You don\u2019t owe them anything. \n\n(52 year old guy here with a 13yo dau, btw. The last thing I would ever want is to have her limit herself for my sake.)", "I asked this and my mom was upset and said she wanted me to marry a stable man and I should be a tradiational SAHM (nothing wrong with that- its not what i am envisioning for myself and journey in life) I was taken aback. Our relationship has been strained for a while because of this as well.\n\nedit: this is a complete 360 of how she raised me. she switched up after my dads 60th birthday party", "And honestly if they view kids as a retirement plan, they should want her to be a doctor. This would increase her earning power and potential to care for them. Also, OP's mom isn't even retirement age and dad are just barely there.  NTA", "Yes!!! Brilliant!", "I think you mean 180.  360 would put you back where you started.", "Oh, no, no, no. You have a plan. Stick to your plan and build a life for yourself. You can always get married down the road.", "Go to medical school. I am your internet auntie and I insist you go. You will hate yourself and your parents if you don't do this. Your mother's emotions are her responsibility, not yours.", "They don't want her to be a doctor, they want her to MARRY a doctor, then spend her entire life at home caring for them.", "If OP and parents live in the US, dad isn't even at retirement age yet -- he was born in 1959, so his retirement age is 66 or 67.", "Your right lmao I\u2019m a science not a math person", "Dammit, she's a doctor, not a physicist!", "Yes, I am 56 and these people are not \"old\" in the sense that they will require geriatric care in the next 7-10 years.  \nMy parents are 79 and 80 and still manage just fine on their own.  I am nearby for emergencies now, but they take very good care of one another.  \nThis is about OP moving away from her bragging rights and control."]}
