And I would just use the unopened bassinet that our mom got my sister(my sister said she didn\u2019t want). And that if I find the crib in my room I would take it to the fire pit in our backyard and burn it. I also told my sister and grandma that I didn\u2019t want it, and they told me that it was the only thing I\u2019m getting from them.

Especially if the dog peed in the crib? throw it away.", "YTA if you jump right to disinviting then, but not if you just say you don\u2019t want the crib. Also as an aside, we now know that SIDS is usually caused by unsafe sleeping practices such as cosleeping. The safest way for a baby to sleep is alone in a crib.", "YTA. I have so many questions though. Was it a new crib or unsafe heirloom crib? How was the dog getting in and out of it? \n\nWas it really unsafe?

You need some serious therapy. \n\nYou come from an extremely dysfunctional family to the point of being raised in foster care.

You owe this to first and foremost yourself, but oftentimes that isn't enough to do that hard, painful, and incredibly necessary work to break the cycle of generational abuse and neglect. \n\nDo you really want your child to grow up with a great-grandmother who will play favorites and make sure they feel less than their cousins? Do you want them to have a grandmother who tells them to just suck it up and be nice when they're insulted or given soiled and unstable \"presents\" while aunties kids gets new, clean, expensive toys?
