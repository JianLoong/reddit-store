The coach for that class is a real jerk. I just started my period this morning.\n\nI tried to explain that to my swim coach but she looked at me funny. She said, \"well use a tampon\". But I've never used one and don't want to start now. I've never put anything down there so I'm kinda scared to use tampons. My teacher said that I was being lazy and using this as an excuse to not participate in class. She said all the girls use them so I was just being difficult. She sent me to the principles office and the principal said that I should've just used a tampon. Apparently big girls don't let things like their period get in the way of doing stuff.\n\nNow I'm thinking over it and second guessing myself.

First of all, regardless of having use a tampon before, period affects women differently some have light flow, others have very heavy flow. So for some women a tampon on their first day is fine for others it is simply not possible. Your coach should not make assumptions about how your period affects you. Now, when you are ready and if you want to use one, please don't be worried. It won't hurt, you insert it and the little cord stay out. When you finish swimming or if you go for a wee, simply pull on the cord and dispose of it in a bin. Then just replace it with a new one or a sanitary towel.

After a few months, after getting the hang of the angle to place one in, I no longer needed to \u201clube it up\u201d. It also helped that I figured out that applicators, which my mum used and taught me to use, didn\u2019t really work for me; once I started using just the tampon, it became much easier to find the right position so it wouldn\u2019t hurt or be uncomfortable.\n\nAs for the coach, they could certainly have been more understanding and careful in how they talked to you but I see their point, even if I disagree with the delivery.

But if it's something you absolutely don't want to do then see if you can switch electives.**\n\nTampons are definitely weird, but if you use them right they aren't as scary as you'd think! Eventually you'll get used to them, and if you put them in right you won't even notice it's there.\n\nA few tips on how to start:\n\n\\-Start with Slim sized tampons with the \"pearl\" applicator from Tampax, they're much easier to get in than some other brands that use the cardboard applicator.  Do this on a day where you don't have swim class, preferably at home so you can be in a comfortable environment. Wear it as long as you feel comfortable, then take it out. Try again the next day as long as you don't feel sore.\n\n\\-When you feel comfortable enough to wear it longer, still make sure to wear a pad as a backup. Until you get used to how heavy your flow is and the strength of the tampons you will probably leak through.\n\n\\-You should always change your tampon every 6\\~ hours (or more frequently if you need more protection. And no you don't have to take them out to pee, just hold the string away so it doesn't get soaked. But it's a good idea to change it each time you go to the bathroom if you can)\n\n\\-Small warning, if you take out a tampon too soon so it's still dry it can be a little irritating to take out. But if you leave it in for a while then when you take it out it won't bother you as much.\n\n\\-Once you feel comfortable with the slims and you feel like you need more leak protection, you can go up to regular and supers. Still make sure to change them every 6-8 hours.\n\nSorry this was long, but I hope it helps!", "NTA. This is so creepy and inappropriate to me. Please bring this up to the school board and your parents/ a trusted adult", "Big girls should never let anyone tell them what they can or cannot do with or to their bodies.

The only time this water pressure can drop slightly is if you laugh, cough, sneeze or move around.\n\n\"We\u2019ve all had nightmares of leaving a trail of blood behind us, but it\u2019s not time to panic,\" points out Dr Sarah Welsh, gynaecologist and cofounder at\u00a0Hanx. \"The water pressure can help prevent the blood flowing out as you swim. However, any increase in abdominal pressure such as coughing or laughing, would change the pressure and a small amount of blood may leak out,\" she adds, although \"a small leakage of blood would be diluted in the water, so very unlikely to be seen.\"\n\nIf you do happen to have any (very unlikely) leaks during your swim, swimming pools are all chlorinated to protect swimmers against the spread of disease from bodily fluids (such as a sweat and urine).\n\nIt's important to be mindful though, that getting out of the water will change the pressure and your period will flow again normally\"\n\nAlso, they link to something I had NO IDEA existed, \"period proof swimwear\":\nhttps://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/body/g40230649/period-proof-swimwear/", "Right?

She isn't going to suddenly lose all of her conditioning and training and swimming ability by skipping 1 week.  If she (or a coach) was worried about that, she could substitute other stretching and strengthening exercises that are done out of the water for that week.\n\nFurther, it's not \"swim team\".  It's an elective class.", "YES, I second all of this comment 100%.

All you're doing is shaming people whose experience is different from your own.\n\nYes, women have been having their periods since the start of time.  That doesn't mean it was \\*comfortable\\* for them.  Some early cultures gave women who were menstruating \"time off\" for the duration of it (in the sense that they had to spend that time in a separate dwelling).  And you know what happened to the women prior to the modern era who had dangerous medical conditions associated with their periods?  They died. That's it.\n\nThe only thing you said here of any value is \"visit your doctor and discuss your problems\".  This SHOULD be between OP and her doctor.

It's especially hard when it's on a topic like how you handle your period, because that is very personal, and because generally speaking, a lot of people are not good at discussing the topic.  There's a lot of baggage around it, and that's really unfair especially to people like you, who are trying to learn how to deal with this. It doesn't help to make you feel ashamed and guilty about it, or about YOUR choices on how you want to deal with it.\n\nYour coach, in particular, is being really gross by pressuring you with \"big girls don't --\"  NO.

Your hymen has a hole in it, that's what allows period blood and normal discharge to come out. \n\nThe first time you have sex, the hymen breaks. So you now have the full entrance to your vagina instead of your vagina, then a membrane over it with a smaller hole. Think of it like a juice box. You can make a small hole with a straw that lets small amounts of liquid through, or peel off the whole top. \n\nPeople's hymens often break long before they have sex. Sometimes if they do sport, sometimes through masturbation, hell even if you fall funny. They're all different shapes and sizes, so while some people will find a tampon fits fine through the existing hole in their hymen, others find it more comfortable once their hymen breaks and there's more space.\n\nThere's definitely enough space, remember your vagina can stretch enough to get a whole baby out of there.
