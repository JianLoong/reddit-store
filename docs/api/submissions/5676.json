This is just bad behavior all around.", "yeah, ESH. i\u2019m very similar and avoid people like that at all costs\u2014just no bandwidth. he being the far greater asshole because holy shit, it\u2019s almost 2023, and as a gay man can we please leave the very circa 2011 catty gay \u201cyeah fuck consent!\u201d stereotype behind\u2026incredibly gross and i\u2019m sorry you experienced that. it is NEVER okay.\n\nhowever, groping him back was also not okay. gently, asshole move. your anger was entirely justified though.", "NTA. Don't dish it out if you can't take it.", "ESH. Nobody should be grabbing other people to make a point.", "NTA - WTF is wrong with that friend? That was pure sexual assault regardless of his sexual orientation.", "No your are NTA, doesn\u2019t matter about sexuality and if people are attracted to you. It is about consent and if you didn\u2019t wanted him to touch you in any way, no matter where. It\u2019s not appropriate for anyone to touch you if you don\u2019t want to. Him using his sexuality to justify it means he has no understanding of what is appropriate behaviour.\n\nAll you did, is treated him as he treated you as if you are not a person with thoughts or feels and just your body.\n\nTo me you were quite calm in how you dealt with it, if it was me, likely given the hardest slap across of face without thinking", "ESH\nHe shouldn't grab you, you shouldn't grab him.\n\nSimple", "NTA, and you reacted fantastically.", "lol, well done. NTA", "NTA. Not getting why he was upset - because you grabbed his ass or because you said you're not attracted to him? Either way, he started it.", "NTA. You dished back what he was serving. It sounds childish, but he started it and you finished it. He should be happy you did what you did instead of filing sexual assault charges.", "ESH. Both of you are guilty of sexual assault. It is NOT okay for him to grab your breast just because he is gay, neither was it ok for you to grab his ass just because you\u2019re not attracted to him. \n\nYou both need to apologise.", "Personally, I would have slapped him HARD. So I think he got off lightly.\n\nNTA", "NTA. He shouldnt have groped you. I dont blame you for your reaction.", "What's good for the goose is good for the gander. He acted like an ass, so you got him back by grabbing his. There was no reason for him to get upset about you doing the same thing he did, back to him.

Sexual harassment and assault just isn\u2019t justifiable.", "I can't believe I'm making this argument but... Call me old-fashioned: a guy grabbing a girl's boob is far worse than a girl grabbing a guy's butt. (orientation is irrelevant.)

His action was not okay. Your reaction was understandable but not okay either.  \nI would not appologize without picking up the topic and let him know crystal clear about your feelings and the he overstepped the line. If his reaction to that makes you still feel like appologizing this may lead to some better understanding on both ends.", "NTA he grabbed your boobs in the same manner as you grabbed his as. So what? If he cannot get it up ...so he's not really gay at all. \nSame rights for all.", "NTA it\u2019s best to follow the kindergarten wisdom of keep your hands to yourself", "Nah give him a nut tap next time", "NTA but you should have kicked him in the balls for grabbing you at all.

It puts a boob grab in a public (non-professional) setting with no threat of further action or significant malicious intent at the same level as a rape.

Yours is as much a SA as his was.", "I believe any form of inappropriate touching is not ok. Putting the label on boob grabbing being sexual assault reinforces how inappropriate it is and makes people step back. \n\nI agree that boob touching and rape aren't in the same category at all, but allowing unwanted sexual touching encourages someone to think its ok and allows for escalation to occur. \"Oh she let me touch her boob, I'm gonna touch the vagina next and see if she likes that too\"\n\nI'm really sorry this happened to you. It's not ok. What you did was essentially the same thing back to him to let him FEEL what its like to be inappropriately touched. And guess what, he didn't like it! So maybe, he will stop his behaviour because he realises that it's not ok to invade someone's personal space like that.", "This is one of the most common sense description I have ever heard of a situation\n\nExpect to be downvoted smh\n\nNta", "personally i think that\u2019s an even greater reason to be direct with him about how radically inappropriate his behavior is and why you don\u2019t like being around him in general\u2014if he\u2019s done this to you he likely does this to his other female friends and has been getting a \u201cpass\u201d he in no way should. an apology on your part would be mature as well, but he\u2019s not entitled to one. grabbing your breasts is beyond the pale, whatever the semantics.", "Well, no, as she will be saying how he made her feel and why it isn't OK.", "Also she also did something wrong. Let's not pretend that she's completely innocent here. If she hadn't grabbed him of course I wouldn't say that she should be the bigger person", "Please Op don't be the bigger person\n\n- You grab someone's boobs\n\n- say it is okay \n\n- because gay is okay to grab boobs without permission\n\n- Op, you grab his back and he is suddenly upset? \n\n- And you have to be the bigger person?
