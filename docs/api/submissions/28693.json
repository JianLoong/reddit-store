Everything was beautiful and I had the honor of being a part of the bridal party. Everyone in the party had a role to play and mine was practically \u201cquality control\u201d for lack of better words. I basically had to go around and make sure people were where they needed to be for pictures, activities, etc. to keep things moving\n\nFirst everything was like butter but I realized my aunt \u201cCarrie\u201d (MOB) kept disappearing and making things fall behind. Not too much a deal in the beginning, but it seemed like as the reception went on Carrie kept making announcements to literally anyone she passed that she had to step away for a minute because it was an emotional day. \n\nIt started to become a scene as seemingly every 20 minutes or so you could see her dramatically wiping her face and climbing over people to speed walk out of the hall to let it out. People quickly got annoyed but didn\u2019t say anything and I tried to ignore it myself but it came to head when Tanya was waiting for pictures and Carrie was nowhere to be found. \n\nI figured she was having a cry but after 10-15 minutes Tanya got really worried. A few of us went to search and it took us nearly 30 minutes to locate her. By the time I get her back it\u2019s been nearly an hour and now things are thrown off/Tanya\u2019s tensions were high. On the way back she kept repeating she\u2019s emotional and it\u2019s a big day. \n\nI told her I know and for that reason she needs to get it together so things can move along smoothly and make less things for Tanya to worry about and she can cry her eyes out when she gets home. She got quiet and didn\u2019t say anything else to me. \n\nWe got back, took pictures and things were good until I noticed yet again Carrie\u2019s gone. I asked around and heard she left and was met with a few dirty looks. Soon after Tanya stormed over in tears and reamed me about \u201cforcing\u201d her mother to leave and feel in the way. How today isn\u2019t about me and I shouldn\u2019t be taking over. She also said a few rude things about me being single and jealous. \n\nI walked away because I was hurt (Tanya has always been my favorite cousin). At the bar I was told by another family member that before Carrie left she went around to a few people including Tanya and said I told her to leave and she wasn\u2019t wanted there so she was leaving to not be a distraction. I was livid. I tried texting Carrie but she wouldn\u2019t respond and Tanya wouldn\u2019t hear my side when I tried to explain. So I just apologized and left. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few days and I\u2019ve been getting mean texts from different guests about how I ruined things and I should get my own wedding to control. When Carrie finally responded she just said next time to keep my mouth shut. I\u2019m just really hurt and now I\u2019m being made to be an evil control freak just because I wanted my aunt to stop making scenes. Should I just have let her be dramatic the whole evening?

You caught heat from her lie. Perhaps you could have delivered you 'support' with less sting but you did not deserve what she dished out. In the future, don't sign up for the 'dramatic stompin' police'.", "NTA. Carrie had her routine down pat to keep drawing attention to herself. Everyone played along because they were likely use to it. You acted reasonably however in a dysfunctional family, healthy boundaries result in escalating and often abusive behavior.  You had no way of knowing in advance that you were dealing with emotionally abusive people. Now you know.  Stay away from all of them.", "NTA.

But you were using the guilt speech on her like she was making it harder for the bride. Her crying jag wasn\u2019t yours to rein in but seems it was to herd her to whatever came up that needed her there. A job that I don\u2019t think should have been anybody\u2019s that was in the wedding. The wedding planner? I would think that. Would have just been her mom kept putting a damper on things but you assured you included yourself putting a damper on things. To the aunt you were the A hole.", "NTA, but this was an own goal. You should never have confronted your Aunt directly. It would have been best to just be a conduit of information to Tanya. When she disappeared, let Tanya know. Let the others know \"It's a big day for her. She's emotional and needs step away for a while.\" Then let Tanya snap at her Mother if she felt like it.", "The simple answer is yes. You should have just allowed her Mom to do whatever nonsense she needed to do because you have no control over others. However, I say that with 30+ years of experience in event planning. This was going to be a shitshow no matter how it was handled. \n\nI think your intentions were good but your execution was maybe not great. You apologized & there\u2019s not much more you can do at this point. You are not going win in this situation. Just ignore the criticism. \n\nNTA but I understand why you\u2019re caught in this crossfire. Your cousin is rightfully upset. Let her cool down. She will get over it & will hopefully recognize that her Mom created the problem\u2026 you were just trying to help & solve the problem.\n\nSometimes you just need to allow others to make a scene & let them be the ahole. If Mom wants to make a spectacle of herself at daughter\u2019s wedding, there\u2019s really no good reason for you to get involved. Best to just sit back & watch the show.", "NTA, your Aunt is the A-hole. If she really love her daughter, she wouldn't make a scene every couple of minutes, like yeah, okay. She's emotional, it's a big day, like she said a gazillion times before. But that doesn't mean it's okay to cause a scene at your own daughter's wedding and lying about you who are just doing what you are asked to do. NTA.", "NTA for the rest of the family simply tell them you are sorry that they are believing Carrie\u2019s lies instead of asking what really was said.", "NTA\n\nYou did your job.\n\nHer mother did this to spite you.\n\nBlock them all until they all apologise to you", "NTA not giving ppl time to defend themselfs is usually AH behaviour. write her a message or letter. state what happend, that you are hurt, and to tell her to stop the flying monkeys.", "This is beautiful. Thank you!", "Thanks for the link, it was an insightful post that I copied to reread. I am no longer steading other people\u2019s boats."]}
