Everything was beautiful and I had the honor of being a part of the bridal party. Everyone in the party had a role to play and mine was practically \u201cquality control\u201d for lack of better words. I basically had to go around and make sure people were where they needed to be for pictures, activities, etc. to keep things moving\n\nFirst everything was like butter but I realized my aunt \u201cCarrie\u201d (MOB) kept disappearing and making things fall behind. Not too much a deal in the beginning, but it seemed like as the reception went on Carrie kept making announcements to literally anyone she passed that she had to step away for a minute because it was an emotional day. \n\nIt started to become a scene as seemingly every 20 minutes or so you could see her dramatically wiping her face and climbing over people to speed walk out of the hall to let it out. People quickly got annoyed but didn\u2019t say anything and I tried to ignore it myself but it came to head when Tanya was waiting for pictures and Carrie was nowhere to be found. \n\nI figured she was having a cry but after 10-15 minutes Tanya got really worried. A few of us went to search and it took us nearly 30 minutes to locate her. By the time I get her back it\u2019s been nearly an hour and now things are thrown off/Tanya\u2019s tensions were high. On the way back she kept repeating she\u2019s emotional and it\u2019s a big day. \n\nI told her I know and for that reason she needs to get it together so things can move along smoothly and make less things for Tanya to worry about and she can cry her eyes out when she gets home. She got quiet and didn\u2019t say anything else to me. \n\nWe got back, took pictures and things were good until I noticed yet again Carrie\u2019s gone. I asked around and heard she left and was met with a few dirty looks. Soon after Tanya stormed over in tears and reamed me about \u201cforcing\u201d her mother to leave and feel in the way. How today isn\u2019t about me and I shouldn\u2019t be taking over. She also said a few rude things about me being single and jealous. \n\nI walked away because I was hurt (Tanya has always been my favorite cousin). At the bar I was told by another family member that before Carrie left she went around to a few people including Tanya and said I told her to leave and she wasn\u2019t wanted there so she was leaving to not be a distraction. I was livid. I tried texting Carrie but she wouldn\u2019t respond and Tanya wouldn\u2019t hear my side when I tried to explain. So I just apologized and left. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few days and I\u2019ve been getting mean texts from different guests about how I ruined things and I should get my own wedding to control. When Carrie finally responded she just said next time to keep my mouth shut. I\u2019m just really hurt and now I\u2019m being made to be an evil control freak just because I wanted my aunt to stop making scenes. Should I just have let her be dramatic the whole evening?

But you were using the guilt speech on her like she was making it harder for the bride. Her crying jag wasn\u2019t yours to rein in but seems it was to herd her to whatever came up that needed her there. A job that I don\u2019t think should have been anybody\u2019s that was in the wedding. The wedding planner? I would think that. Would have just been her mom kept putting a damper on things but you assured you included yourself putting a damper on things. To the aunt you were the A hole.", "NTA, but this was an own goal. You should never have confronted your Aunt directly. It would have been best to just be a conduit of information to Tanya. When she disappeared, let Tanya know. Let the others know \"It's a big day for her. She's emotional and needs step away for a while.\" Then let Tanya snap at her Mother if she felt like it.", "The simple answer is yes. You should have just allowed her Mom to do whatever nonsense she needed to do because you have no control over others. However, I say that with 30+ years of experience in event planning. This was going to be a shitshow no matter how it was handled. \n\nI think your intentions were good but your execution was maybe not great. You apologized & there\u2019s not much more you can do at this point. You are not going win in this situation. Just ignore the criticism. \n\nNTA but I understand why you\u2019re caught in this crossfire. Your cousin is rightfully upset. Let her cool down. She will get over it & will hopefully recognize that her Mom created the problem\u2026 you were just trying to help & solve the problem.\n\nSometimes you just need to allow others to make a scene & let them be the ahole. If Mom wants to make a spectacle of herself at daughter\u2019s wedding, there\u2019s really no good reason for you to get involved. Best to just sit back & watch the show.\n\neta \u2014 OP if it makes you feel any better \u2026 I have done this so many times that I now have a contract clause that states my staff & I control the event not the guests. Specifically for this reason. If we are asked to get involved with a guest\u2019s disruptive behavior we have the option to decline & if we agree to be involved we will do our best but cannot guarantee any results (our solution is always to distract not correct) \u2026. We know it\u2019s like handling a live grenade. It can blow up very quickly\u2026 suddenly I\u2019m the asshole & no one wants to pay the final invoice. You really couldn\u2019t win in this situation.", "NTA, your Aunt is the A-hole. If she really love her daughter, she wouldn't make a scene every couple of minutes, like yeah, okay.

I am no longer steading other people\u2019s boats.", "INFO UPDATE: A few people have mentioned it may have been my tone. I will admit I was extremely irritated in my last interaction with my aunt. But I did not yell or curse at her. I just told her we both know today is important so she needs to get it together and she can cry as much as she wants later. When I last found her she was on a pier smoking attached to the lake behind the venue. \n\nAside from being irritated about being her wrangler all day, I wasn\u2019t too pleased that I had to take of my shoes, hike up a heavy dress, walk across a field barefoot, convince her to come back, walk back across a field, clean myself up, then smile for pictures like everything was perfect and I wasn\u2019t getting stressed myself. \n\nI answered below Tanyas dad passed years ago but aunt has since remarried and new husband couldn\u2019t stay the whole even but pretty much doesn\u2019t do anything to rein her in anyway\n\nAunt is constantly dramatic. Any event she tries to make about herself even a funeral once. I can agree I think Tanya is used to it and blind to it now \n\nI suggested moving on without Carrie once and Tanya wouldn\u2019t have it so that\u2019s why I tried so hard to keep Carrie where she needed to be because Tanya wanted her there for all the pictures and activities.

I was your role for my cousin's wedding and had to do similar stuff. I would have been wrecked if this had happened to me. I'd steer clear of anyone involved.

You spoke to your aunt unkindly and made the situation worse instead of better.

Your cousin clearly misconstrued your efforts to help; I would contact her and your aunt, and apologize for offending them, and explain that you were truly trying to help, but in retrospect, wish you'd handle it differently.

The only way she could have gotten more attention would have been to pass out on the dance floor.", "NTA; you did nothing wrong.

Was she there to help her cousin or the photographer? She was assigned a job to make her cousins life easier and she made it worse by being indelicate. Full stop. Also the way OP seems to keep implying  that remarrying means her aunt can\u2019t be emotional about her husbands death demonstrates OP isn\u2019t a super emotionally aware. OP also doesn\u2019t seem to like her aunt very much from the tone of how she talks about her here. If I\u2019m wrong, OP would apologize. But Reddit AITA commenters notoriously lack empathy when it comes to people\u2019s emotions.", "People like that are incredibly draining and dangerous because you're always on high alert, waiting for the knife in the back. No contact really is the only way to deal with them.", "No, I read that and still think she's an asshole for making the MOB feel so uncomfortable attending her daughters wedding that she felt she had to lie about the reason why.", "I think OP is an asshole for not having compassion. These aren\u2019t just regular tears. Her husband DIED. This is a huge day where she\u2019s feeling that loss intensely. She\u2019s not stirring shit up. She\u2019s having a human emotion. Yes, I do think she\u2019s a bit of asshole for holding everything up. But like fuck, wouldn\u2019t you too???? Your husband died and you\u2019re at your daughters wedding. You genuinely would be able to get through it without needing to take any breaks???? Yea I think she\u2019s an asshole for going around lying. But overall? OP is the asshole for having this expectation that she shouldn\u2019t cry in the first place", "dude I was thinking literally these points\u2026. like this whole thing sounds SO biased against the aunt considering OP didn\u2019t even include the reason WHY she was crying in the original post. I want to hear the other side of the story so badly", "Damn y'all are dense", "Found the MOB. Narcissist personality/Main Character Syndrome.\n\nIn an upside down world.", "You are just making things up to fit a narrative you created now. She is a perpetual shit stirrer, we know from the post. In the comments, we read she does this type of thing everywhere, from birthdays to weddings. The aunt never expressed a word about her previous husband anywhere. Taking breaks is fine. Leaving multiple times for over half an hour, and stretching up to an hour, when you know there is places you are needed? Gigantic asshole move. OP is firmly not the asshole, go cry in the fucking bathroom for 10 minutes if you need to, or even in the open, because a mom being overwhelmed and emotional can be excused, but not the repeatedly completely self-centered asshole choices. Stick the actual facts outlined, and not a headcanon.", "What am I making up? That her husband died??", "That her dead husband has anything to do with it. It isn\u2019t stated anywhere, it isn\u2019t even implied. Is it likely to be part of it? Sure. Is it tragic? Yes. Does it excuse her fucking up plans a ridiculous amount of times? Not even a little bit. Does she have a history of doing this shit without having that excuse? A vast, storied one. I\u2019m not going to argue with someone who has to make up their own story alongside the actual story any longer.\n\nEdit: we haven\u2019t even touched on the fact the mother straight up left, knowing what that would cause, and then lied about it. Delusional."]}
