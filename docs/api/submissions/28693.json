Everything was beautiful and I had the honor of being a part of the bridal party. Everyone in the party had a role to play and mine was practically \u201cquality control\u201d for lack of better words. I basically had to go around and make sure people were where they needed to be for pictures, activities, etc. to keep things moving\n\nFirst everything was like butter but I realized my aunt \u201cCarrie\u201d (MOB) kept disappearing and making things fall behind. Not too much a deal in the beginning, but it seemed like as the reception went on Carrie kept making announcements to literally anyone she passed that she had to step away for a minute because it was an emotional day. \n\nIt started to become a scene as seemingly every 20 minutes or so you could see her dramatically wiping her face and climbing over people to speed walk out of the hall to let it out. People quickly got annoyed but didn\u2019t say anything and I tried to ignore it myself but it came to head when Tanya was waiting for pictures and Carrie was nowhere to be found. \n\nI figured she was having a cry but after 10-15 minutes Tanya got really worried. A few of us went to search and it took us nearly 30 minutes to locate her. By the time I get her back it\u2019s been nearly an hour and now things are thrown off/Tanya\u2019s tensions were high. On the way back she kept repeating she\u2019s emotional and it\u2019s a big day. \n\nI told her I know and for that reason she needs to get it together so things can move along smoothly and make less things for Tanya to worry about and she can cry her eyes out when she gets home. She got quiet and didn\u2019t say anything else to me. \n\nWe got back, took pictures and things were good until I noticed yet again Carrie\u2019s gone. I asked around and heard she left and was met with a few dirty looks. Soon after Tanya stormed over in tears and reamed me about \u201cforcing\u201d her mother to leave and feel in the way. How today isn\u2019t about me and I shouldn\u2019t be taking over. She also said a few rude things about me being single and jealous. \n\nI walked away because I was hurt (Tanya has always been my favorite cousin). At the bar I was told by another family member that before Carrie left she went around to a few people including Tanya and said I told her to leave and she wasn\u2019t wanted there so she was leaving to not be a distraction. I was livid. I tried texting Carrie but she wouldn\u2019t respond and Tanya wouldn\u2019t hear my side when I tried to explain. So I just apologized and left. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few days and I\u2019ve been getting mean texts from different guests about how I ruined things and I should get my own wedding to control. When Carrie finally responded she just said next time to keep my mouth shut. I\u2019m just really hurt and now I\u2019m being made to be an evil control freak just because I wanted my aunt to stop making scenes. Should I just have let her be dramatic the whole evening?

But you were using the guilt speech on her like she was making it harder for the bride. Her crying jag wasn\u2019t yours to rein in but seems it was to herd her to whatever came up that needed her there. A job that I don\u2019t think should have been anybody\u2019s that was in the wedding. The wedding planner? I would think that. Would have just been her mom kept putting a damper on things but you assured you included yourself putting a damper on things. To the aunt you were the A hole.", "NTA, but this was an own goal. You should never have confronted your Aunt directly. It would have been best to just be a conduit of information to Tanya. When she disappeared, let Tanya know. Let the others know \"It's a big day for her. She's emotional and needs step away for a while.\" Then let Tanya snap at her Mother if she felt like it.", "The simple answer is yes. You should have just allowed her Mom to do whatever nonsense she needed to do because you have no control over others. However, I say that with 30+ years of experience in event planning. This was going to be a shitshow no matter how it was handled. \n\nI think your intentions were good but your execution was maybe not great. You apologized & there\u2019s not much more you can do at this point. You are not going win in this situation. Just ignore the criticism. \n\nNTA but I understand why you\u2019re caught in this crossfire. Your cousin is rightfully upset. Let her cool down. She will get over it & will hopefully recognize that her Mom created the problem\u2026 you were just trying to help & solve the problem.\n\nSometimes you just need to allow others to make a scene & let them be the ahole. If Mom wants to make a spectacle of herself at daughter\u2019s wedding, there\u2019s really no good reason for you to get involved. Best to just sit back & watch the show.\n\neta \u2014 OP if it makes you feel any better \u2026 I have done this so many times that I now have a contract clause that states my staff & I control the event not the guests. Specifically for this reason. If we are asked to get involved with a guest\u2019s disruptive behavior we have the option to decline & if we agree to be involved we will do our best but cannot guarantee any results (our solution is always to distract not correct) \u2026. We know it\u2019s like handling a live grenade. It can blow up very quickly\u2026 suddenly I\u2019m the asshole & no one wants to pay the final invoice. You really couldn\u2019t win in this situation.", "NTA, your Aunt is the A-hole. If she really love her daughter, she wouldn't make a scene every couple of minutes, like yeah, okay.

But I did not yell or curse at her. I just told her we both know today is important so she needs to get it together and she can cry as much as she wants later. When I last found her she was on a pier smoking attached to the lake behind the venue. \n\nAside from being irritated about being her wrangler all day, I wasn\u2019t too pleased that I had to take of my shoes, hike up a heavy dress, walk across a field barefoot, convince her to come back, walk back across a field, clean myself up, then smile for pictures like everything was perfect and I wasn\u2019t getting stressed myself. \n\nI answered below Tanyas dad passed years ago but aunt has since remarried and new husband couldn\u2019t stay the whole even but pretty much doesn\u2019t do anything to rein her in anyway\n\nAunt is constantly dramatic. Any event she tries to make about herself even a funeral once. I can agree I think Tanya is used to it and blind to it now \n\nI suggested moving on without Carrie once and Tanya wouldn\u2019t have it so that\u2019s why I tried so hard to keep Carrie where she needed to be because Tanya wanted her there for all the pictures and activities.

I was your role for my cousin's wedding and had to do similar stuff. I would have been wrecked if this had happened to me. I'd steer clear of anyone involved.

You spoke to your aunt unkindly and made the situation worse instead of better.

OP was obviously well thought of to be in the wedding party. Assuming that OP didn't have a history of being mean nasty and cruel they should hear her side.", "What's your aunt problem? Why was she so unhinged during the whole event? Didn't your cousin knew about her poor attitude?\n\nIt's a shame an adult can't behave properly in an event, if your cousin knew about your aunt shenanigans shame on her for blaming you OP.\n\nNTA but that toxic people don't worth your time and energy, block them for your own mental health.", "NTA No kidding, we will be hearing from Tanya\u2019s new husband on Justnomil.  Carrie is a hot mess.", "> I wouldn't be attending any family gatherings again ~~until i got an apology~~. \n\nFTFY", "they're all crazy. You don't need these people in your life.", "I wanted to give the mother of the bride the benefit of the doubt, that she really was just emotional because her daughter was getting married. \n\nWhen she lied about OP wanting her to leave I realized that yeah, she was bring a drama queen and lied about OP to punish OP for calling her out on her behavior. \n\nI would advise OP that if she\u2019s ever put in this position again, to just let the person know \u201chey, we need you for pictures, can we expect you in a few minutes?\u201d  Then let it be. Carrie probably thought this was one day she could be emotional and get away with calling a bit of attention to herself, as she was the mother of the bride. Carrie is still the AH for twisting OP\u2019s words and outright lying about OP.", ">It\u2019s too bad you didn\u2019t encourage or the bride think of it herself- to  keep the ball rolling instead of waiting around for her mom\n\nWould have been the same result.  Mom wanted the attention", "This. So much this.", "Op did nothing wrong here. Carrie's behavior is not normal.", "This. Short and sweet.", "This. Really surprised everyone is telling OP to cut contact with the cousin. \n\nTanya was already stressed not just because of the wedding, but all the details and especially her mom. Give Tanya time to cool down. Let her get back from her honeymoon. If she\u2019s still causing issues, you can then decide low/no contact. It\u2019s not fair you bore the brunt of it and that MOB manipulated everything to be about her, but you can\u2019t change it and you can\u2019t win with people like MOB. I hope things work out for you", "I would never sign a contract with someone that allowed them to control my event. Not a chance in hell.", "You are definitely NTA. Carrie and Tanya are. \n\nCarrie for making everything about her (typical narcissist) and throwing you under the bus when called out, and Tanya for being mad at you when she gave you a tough job and saw that you were just trying to do your best for her sake (then turning around to insult you by calling you single and \"jealous,\" what?!). They both owe you an apology. And it may be best that you distance yourself from these toxic people going forward. \n\nIf I were you, I'd share what you wrote here on social media with your family and friends. Your side of the story deserves to be heard. \n\nNo good deed goes unpunished, it seems. Sorry you had to go through this.", "My thoughts exactly.", "Tanya was busy getting married. I can't believe people are telling OP she should have done this and that. Carrie's behavior was completely nuts. Nobody could have predicted it.", "She sounds like the type of woman who needs to be the centre of attention- they always start acting up at weddings, or other important events. Sometimes it will be the mother of the groom pulling silly stunts, like wearing white to the ceremony - but I\u2019ve noticed it seems to be more specific to women of a certain age- usually late 50s/60s. \n\nIn clinical terms, they\u2019re often called histrionic. She wasn\u2019t sooo emotional at all. She just wanted everyone wondering where she was, was she ok, hadn\u2019t someone better go find her etc etc. Then comforting her, giving her attention, saying how much she must care for her daughter\u2026 eughhh. They also get a perverse satisfaction from disrupting things for everyone- it shows how important she must be- that everyone has to stand around and wait for Her Highness to finally make an appearance. It\u2019s no different to a spoilt child acting up at someone else\u2019s birthday party.\n\nAnd just like a child, she threw a petulant strop when called out on it. She was actually prepared to leave her own daughter\u2019s wedding- in the name of point scoring. Thus ensuring that the drama may now continue indefinitely as she tells her story to every single person who will listen, receives more comforting words and attention, sends flying monkeys to further attack OP for her horrific cruelty\u2026 and so on. \n\nShe has successfully achieved her mission and all attention is now on her.\n\nNTA", "Sorry I fell asleep. Her husband (my uncle/Tanya\u2019s dad) passed 6 years ago. She has a new partner but he was only able to stay for the ceremony and had to leave shortly after the first dance in the reception. But he is a lot more\u2026 I\u2019m not sure if docile or complicit would be correct words? He just goes along with her behavior silently. Like the kind of husbands you see on TV that silently sip beers in the corner while their partners are having a freak out", "I did try to tell who I could. No one wanted to believe me which hurt more because my aunt does this stuff all the time. Family gatherings, birthdays, graduations. Never fails. One person even respond \u201cI\u2019m not reading all of that\u201d when I explained what REALLY happened so I gave up and just started ignoring people.", "what a tryhard pick me girl", "Not sure where you got your assumptions but I was told by the bride herself to keep things on schedule (which obviously was not made or planned out by me at all) and get people where they need to be. I suggested moving on without her ONCE and my cousin acted like I spat on her dress so yeah I did what I could to get everyone in place and keep my cousin happy and stress free", "I don't think that would work. People have already decided what they want to decide, and it will just make OP look like she's making excuses, not explanations.   \nLeave it alone, OP, and let them say what they want. Go low or no contact. NTA", "She wanted everything to be about her. When she got called out on it, she reacted like the drama queen she is.", "Main Character Syndrome. Momzilla.", "This.  When reading about a narcissistic parent like this I wonder as I how their own kids can\u2019t see through what\u2019s really going on.  Best of luck to the groom.", "True That grab the \ud83c\udf7f", "Eh, from the begining it was obvious Carrie was exagerating, i get being emotional, but hse ddint need to loudly exclaim that shes leaving every 5 minutes", "Mom would throw a tantrum towards her daughter for excluding her probably", "Tanya said OP was \u201cjealous and single\u201d. That is massively, *massively* crossing the line and is why so many of us say to hell with her.\n\nWithout the mother of all apologies, I personally would never talk to that cousin again.", "Then don\u2019t hire an event planner? \n\nThey said that they and their staff control the event, for example at a wedding making sure things happen in time and direct the flow of traffic, keep everyone on task until it\u2019s time for the party. It\u2019s still your event, they\u2019re just there to make it so that you can focus on getting married, not all the little details.", "We are trained to ignore and let them do their thing. Once we get out of the fog it stops. I have nmom, edad and gcnsis. I am well versed in the handling of these people. I do not stand for it and my nmom says she needs pillows surrounding her any time she speaks to me because I am \"harsh\".... hahahaha. She is a cranky mean woman.", "I am an event planner.", "What is it that you do? You are hired to manage an event.\n\nEdit spelling", "Yes, several. Conventions, parties, fundraisers, a few balls.", "I\u2019m asking how do you manage an event without any control. Someone has to be in charge.", "Handling an event and taking control over the client's wishes are two different things. I wouldn't take it upon myself to interfere in this kind of family dynamic unless actual danger was present (i.e. the authorities needed to be called, etc.) Nobody pays me to unilaterally decide that their relatives or friends can't be there. Normally, venue staff would be responsible for security and making those decisions along with the family. Not me.", "I think we are agreeing then \u2026 I own an event planning business (20+ years). We are hired by the host/organization. We mange all the pieces of the puzzle to create the picture. It\u2019s our job to make the vision a reality. Vendors are professionals they know how to do their job however we still control the event. As I said we only control the event (not the client) not the guests.", "Isn't that the same thing the original commenter wrote?", "Ah, I think I must have misunderstood what you meant.", "I misread it."]}
