We\u2019ve been getting along well etc, but there has been one thing that bothered me a little; I got a tiny room while they both got giant rooms. Our apartment setup is basically a long hallway with a very large kitchen and a bathroom and then two large bedrooms and one small bedroom. \n  When my roommates toured our apartment I couldn\u2019t make it due to classes that I absolutely couldn\u2019t miss, and it didn\u2019t seem like a big deal so my roommate F and our friend M went to go scout things out and ended up loving the complex so we decided that was where we would move. Later in the summer, it became clear they had both already claimed the bigger rooms and given me the small room without any discussion which I wasnt super happy about but let slide because I was under the impression that was what was available and just wanted to avoid conflict. \n  Fast forward to move in day, I see my room versus their room and realize they kind of downplayed just how small my room was. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s NOT a bad space, but compared to how big their rooms are, I very clearly got the short end of the stick. I sleep on a twin bed and am unable to host people due to how small my room is and our lack of a real common area outside the table in our kitchen, while they both have plenty of room to have furniture for when people come over. I once again let it go, my room is still a clear upgrade from my last apartment with F and I like both of my roommates. \n  Anyways, about a week ago they let it slip that they took the smaller room unit in favor of a bigger kitchen and the larger rooms, forgoing another unit with more equal sized rooms and a common space with a much smaller kitchen. Now i\u2019m upset. Why should I take the fall for the bigger kitchen when that wasn\u2019t what I wanted (I don\u2019t cook by choice), obviously they chose the bigger kitchen so I feel like one of them should have taken the smaller room in exchange for the choice THEY MADE. I also spoke to a close mutual friend of ours yesterday who told me she remembers them laughing on facetime over the summer about how they were just gonna give me the smaller room and they were taking the big rooms. I can\u2019t help but feel like I was thrown under the bus, and i\u2019m not sure if they thought it was fair because I couldn\u2019t go on the tour with them or what, but hearing this coming from F, who i\u2019ve known for over 5 years, is an especially big betrayal because she knows very well how much I wanted to be able to host people this year as well as how bad my mental health was because I felt trapped in my smaller room last year.

You should have objected at the time rather than agreeing to it because now a confrontation will just seem awkward. If you really don\u2019t like this space then I guess consider different roommates or make more of an effort to be in the process (yes I understand why you couldn\u2019t go the first time) next time.", "NTA, but food for thought here.  What would confronting them accomplish?  Take this as a lesson learned, never agree to anything or take on something like a lease without your laying eyes on the situation.  Demanding an apology is going to accomplish nothing except hard feelings.  What's done is done for now, unless your willing and able to find another apartment, without your roommates, with a bedroom more to your liking.", "NTA. You do need to confront them, not for an apology but for a reduction in the rent.  They have more square footage so they should be paying more and you less.", "INFO: Are you paying less rent accordingly? If not, I'd talk to them and renegotiate. If they disagree try to move out ASAP.", "YWBTA - as per your comment, you pay less rent. You can think the room is too small but you already know it\u2019s small and you\u2019re getting a break in the rent. What would confronting your roommates accomplish? Sucks you got stuck with the smaller room but that\u2019s what you signed up for.", "INFO: I do pay less for the smaller room, but that is by design of the complex charging by room and not by unit, for everyone asking", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Since you have the smaller room, instead of a 33% each, you should paid like 20% or 25% of rent.\nIts not fair and they know it. They will try to guilt trip you or manipulate you, don't let them. If they don't agree, then leave that place, find some place else to live and find better friends.\n\nEdit after getting more info: Since you pay less already, then YTA bit. Sure you could complaint about it, but theres nothing you could do than move out of there and find a better place for you.", "I'm sorry. What I'm hearing is you couldn't show up to make a choice, and now you're mad at the choice that was made for you? Do your roommates cook? Maybe they enjoy the bigger kitchen because they cook food. \n\nWhile I understand that you're busy with school, you kind of can't be mad at the choice they made if you can't make time to be involved in the living quarter's choice. Yes, they suck for making fun of sticking you in the small room, but if you're not going to go look at the space before committing to living there, I'm not sure what you expect. \n\nYTA.", "What\u2019s paying less rent in this case ? What\u2019s the value between what they pay and what you pay ?", "NTA. What they did was pretty crappy. Just keep in mind what you want to get out of talking to them. Even though they're in the wrong, if you're too accusatory, you do risk damaging the relationship without actually getting any benefit in return. Telling them how their actions made you feel and that you think it was wrong is wholly appropriate, but it's in your best interest to approach it strategically. Also, if you have a smaller room, you should definitely be paying less. If that's not the case, you should absolutely bring that up.\n\nAnd take it from someone who's also learned the hard way, when you're looking for a place with roommates, who gets what room should ALWAYS be discussed before you even consider signing a lease.", "No, I do pay slightly less for my smaller room.", "I pay less because we pay by room and not just in general.", "Yes! I do pay less, which is partially why I didn\u2019t make a big stink because in that regard it was fair.", "I think that\u2019s kind of the issue i have, is that i feel like I signed up for it under the pretense that it was our only option to get into this complex and they sort of hid from me that they just gave me the smaller room because neither one wanted it.", "She pays less rent than everyone else", "They do cook and that\u2019s absolutely reasonable they want a bigger kitchen, but they chose the smaller room in exchange for the bigger kitchen and then did not tell me that\u2019s why the unit had a smaller room. so they decided without me that they would take the big rooms and they got the big kitchen, and I was given the small room that would\u2019ve been larger if not for the larger kitchen", "I do want to defend myself a little in that they were very adamant on picking this space and made it seem like if we didn\u2019t jump at that exact moment we would lose the ability to move into the apartment. They never discussed with me after choosing it that that was their plan. They chose the unit most beneficial to them and hid that from me until a week ago.", "The difference is pretty small, but that isn\u2019t by their design. The payment is individual and decided by the apartment complex. we do not get in each other\u2019s finances at all as we are charged per room rather than by unit.", "Yeah, lesson definitely learned there, like I said in another comment the viewing of this complex was supposed to be one in a long line of viewings, but they came here and liked it so much they decided we should live here, which I was fine with, I just didn\u2019t realize that in my absence I would be thrown under the bus", "I just thought of another question, sorry.\n\nDid they sign the lease without you or did you know about the room situation beforehand?", "Well it's fair at least in that regard.  You can say how you feel about it but I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't apologize.", "The time to object is long over. Start thinking about a new place when you can", "The lease was signed before they made it clear to me that was what was being chosen, which was part of the issue of why I didn\u2019t speak up originally because obviously at that point I\u2019d already legally agreed to live there"]}
