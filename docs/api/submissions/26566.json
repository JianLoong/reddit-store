Maybe she feels like she sees you all of the time so flies off to laugh with her friends and loses track of time, she wouldn't be the first one. But since this was a party where she knew you didn't really know anybody she should have come around to you and bring you into some of the fun conversations or at least come to be with you occasionally so you didn't feel totally left out and awkward trying to start up conversations that you may not want to be in anyway since you say you're not social like she is. Especially since this has happened before. Definitely NTA and 3 hours is pretty long for someone who's not too involved in the party. You could be more involved but maybe you're an introvert. A 3 hour party would be really hard if you are. Maybe you don't really like small talk and chit chat so you would need to have someone to have a real conversation with to get any enjoyment out of it and I get that. Maybe you don't really drink so watching the trajectory of a bunch of people partying and drinking just isn't your thing. All of these are OK but since it seems your GF loves these parties maybe she should go to some of them without you. You can plan real date type nights as this type of party is not really a date night if you're not into it.", "My wife hates me for doing this so so many times..

You need her company more to feel comfortable.\n\nMay I suggest you both work out an agreement. Maybe she goes out without you one night every other weekend and socializes with her friends. Then the two of you go out one night on the alternate weekends - maybe once where it is just the two of you doing something together and maybe once where the two of you go to a larger gathering, but your wife sticks with you.

You don't need to go to these parties. Both of you also need to clarify whether or not it is a \"date\" when you go out together. You both need to be comfortable being in each other's orbit without being a two-headed monster, just so long as it is effectively communicated. \n\nI don't think you're the asshole but I don't think either of you are tackling this with the right level of respect for each other.

You frankly should have nixed the whole idea from the beginning. \n\nAs far as going to future parties, do this. Tell her that if she ditches you at a party you will leave and not come back and she will be on her own to get home. Or even better yet, go to parties where you both know people there. \n\nThe other option for the next party is drop her off, say a few hello\u2019s and go do something else and pick her up at an appointed time.
