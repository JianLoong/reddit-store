Maybe she feels like she sees you all of the time so flies off to laugh with her friends and loses track of time, she wouldn't be the first one. But since this was a party where she knew you didn't really know anybody she should have come around to you and bring you into some of the fun conversations or at least come to be with you occasionally so you didn't feel totally left out and awkward trying to start up conversations that you may not want to be in anyway since you say you're not social like she is. Especially since this has happened before. Definitely NTA and 3 hours is pretty long for someone who's not too involved in the party. You could be more involved but maybe you're an introvert. A 3 hour party would be really hard if you are. Maybe you don't really like small talk and chit chat so you would need to have someone to have a real conversation with to get any enjoyment out of it and I get that. Maybe you don't really drink so watching the trajectory of a bunch of people partying and drinking just isn't your thing. All of these are OK but since it seems your GF loves these parties maybe she should go to some of them without you. You can plan real date type nights as this type of party is not really a date night if you're not into it.", "My wife hates me for doing this so so many times..
