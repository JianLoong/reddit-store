Starting when my ex first married her. She told me that now they were a two parent household, there was no need for me to show up to all games, recitals, plays, etc, because she would be going to them and there only needed to be one. I ignored her because I have always gone to that kind of thing. I'm self employed and so I can easily plan my working day around events for my kids. My kids also want me there. They always tell me about the bigger moments in their extra curricular's or school and tell me when I should be there or if I need tickets, etc. My ex goes when he can which is not often and he never goes to anything he doesn't consider big enough.\n\nEx's wife mentioned it to me again last year that she wanted to go alone and I needed to only show up when it's my parenting time. Yet again I ignored her request and continued showing up. My ex mentioned it to me also and I told him that we could both go to their activities whenever we like and it is not dictated by the court order since it doesn't take parenting time to show up and support our children.\n\nMy son had a recital a couple of weeks ago and he told me they were asked if they could get parental volunteers. I said of course I would do it. My ex's wife had asked when she was picking him up from his dance class one day if she could do more, they mentioned volunteers and she offered. We both arrived together and she was upset the whole two hours we were helping out. She was especially upset when I stayed. Afterward she told me that she's trying to create a special bond with the kids but they will never want her around as long as I'm there and if I was a good person/mom, I would do the right thing and not show up every time and give her a chance to do it so she can show an extra effort for my kids. I told her I will always show up as long as my kids want me and as long as I can physically do it. She told me her relationship with the kids is important though and I honestly told her it's not important to me. That my kids wishes as well as my relationship with them is more important.\n\nMy ex's wife told me I was an ass and she called me a selfish and jealous baby momma and accused me of \"unreasonable hatred\".

NTA.\n\n>She told me her relationship with the kids is important though and I honestly told her it's not important to me\n\nOk that's slightly an AH thing to say. I get where you're coming from, especially combined with the annoyance of trying to make you disappear from these kids' life outside of your own home, but it's important for your kids too that they get along with their stepmother. Not more important than your relationship, but she's part of their lives. I wouldn't have said that.", "If she wants a good relationship with step kids maybe she should try treating their mom better instead of trying to cancel her out.", "Nta I can appreciate the stepmother making an effort with your kids (it's better than the opposite. ) But she's way out of line asking you to step back from activities work your own children. \n\nThere's nothing to indicate jealousy or \"hatred' on your part.", "NTA\n\nAt this point, I would go nuclear and get a lawyer.

The expectation that you should stop supporting your children at their extracurricular activities just because someone else can also support them is ridiculous. Your ex\u2019s wife wanting to bond with the kids is nice but she should do so by planning her own activities with the kids.", "NTA -- I suggest you keep a record of her remarks -- what she says, when and where -- in case it is useful in a parental alienation claim in the courts.\n\nAnd to call you the baby mama is entirely weird since it is intended as an insult -- you are your children's mother, full stop.", "NTA\n\nShe wants to be a better mother by making you a worse mother. She thinks children's love is limited and to get some she has to take it from someone else.", "Ehhh... You are not the asshole here. \n\nI'm a stepmother and a mother in a blended family. \n\nMy MOM perspective: When my ex and I first split, he used to show up during activities I had with my son and try to horn in. I wasn't too happy about that. I left him alone during his parenting time, he needed to do the same for me. But if it were a school or sporting event, that was different - he can be there just as much as I could. I might not have liked it, but it wasn't my place to say no to that. And vice versa, but if it wasn't on my time I'd show up but  basically didn't take the lead.\n\nThe difference here is that this isn't stepmother's time, it's dad's time. If he passes it up, it doesn't go to stepmom. She's essentially not a party in this. \n\nMy STEPMOM perspective: Building that relationship is important - and that relationship is built up by spending time together and doing stuff together. His kids will have happier lives now and in the future if we have a harmonious family life now. I do that when they are here in our household. When stepkids have a major life event I need to support, I show up, with their dad. Only once have I been really cross with their mother over her presence, we were spending time as a family on our respective court ordered time doing an unofficial activity. She showed up to the fun stuff and interfered  - after she insisted we help her son with one of his chores as it was 'our weekend'.  She wasn't just interfering with my partner's time, but also with my time with my son. I was furious. She invited us around for lunch and I declined. I wanted my time with my family - and she is not a part of that. So there is definitely a line. \n\nQuestions to ask - are your kids' schedules so packed that there isn't much down time for them even in the other household? Did you agree as both parents on what activities the kids would do? Are you using your kids' activities to interfere with dad's time?  You might be doing nothing wrong at all. And I totally get what it's like to have an ex who does none of the hard yards of getting kids to events and activities that are important. My son has ONE sport. His dad has completely noped out of it. But I've also seen how my partner's ex doesn't give their kids a second to breathe (a times they had five or six scheduled activities outside school) and has deliberately scheduled things on dad's time to control the situation.", "She told on herself when she called you a \u201cbaby mama.\u201d She wants to become their mom and have you be their deadbeat egg donor.

NTA", "NTA she doesn\u2019t want to bond with your children, she wants to replace you. I think it\u2019s time to stop being so nice and put this woman in her place.

If you keep being inappropriate and trying to intervene with MY kids, you will force me to take ex back to court and re-evaluate our custody agreement. Let me make it perfectly clear, you are not now, nor will you ever be their Mother. If you want to form a STEP-mother bond with the kids, you need to come up with ways during my husbands parenting time. But trying to kick me out of my kids extracurriculars and than having the GALL to act as if I did something wrong, will no longer be tolerated. This is your last warning. Ex, I don\u2019t want to put our kids or you through a custody battle, so I suggest you talk to your wife because I am DONE with this.

Use a parenting app in the future to document everything if you aren't already.", "NTA. She is totally in the wrong here, but maybe you can help her see the light for the sake of the kiddos.  Maybe sit them both down and explain that the kids need all the support they can get in their lives.  That you can ALL show up for events and that will only make the kids happier.  If they see the parents have a good friendly co-parent relationship, the kids are more apt to feel happy with how things are and build relationships with all of you without having to feel any guilt.  The tug o war with the kids is NOT in their best interest as it causes the kids stress they do not need.", "NTA at all. They\u2019re not a two-parent household. It\u2019s a one parent and spouse household. You\u2019re not replaceable. She seems to be confused what her role is.\n\nWhile I\u2019m not saying step parents aren\u2019t parents, the Step\u2019s role is to allow the relationship to develop organically, and with recognition that it\u2019s not a power play between them and the Bio. She doesn\u2019t understand hierarchy at all, and imo, is using your kids to fill her need to be a parent. She sounds like the jealous and hateful one. \n\nI probably would take the honey vs vinegar route of explaining to her that while I appreciate her love for my kids, it\u2019s not a case of her-vs-me. That her focus on needing me to be gone is detrimental to the kids, whom she claims to love so much. I\u2019d actually even try to befriend her a little bit, because I hate drama. Ofc, she could probably be one of those people who are so hellbent on drama that it wouldn\u2019t be possible to even forge a surface level \u2018friendship\u2019. But I would also keep records - emails/texts\u2026bc if she sticks around, she and your ex will one day blame you for their shitty relationship, and when your kids are older, you can show them and say \u2018hey, I tried\u2019. \n\nEither way, absolutely NTA.", "NTA Sounds to me like you a good mother.

But it's on your ex and his wife to define her role, and find situations where she can build her own bond with the children, and she should never, ever try to push out an involved bio parent!\n\n\nMaybe you can try to get her back to the important thing: You're both trying to do your best to make the children happy.\n\n\nMy SD's mother just recently made SD's first day of school all about how horrible it was that we were there, too, and I was just feeling so sorry for her, because she couldn't enjoy her daughter's day in lieu of her own bitterness.\n\n\nIt's hard to navigate these situations, but it's for a good cause, after all.", "Yes, but if she wants to cut mom out instead of work with her why should mom care? \n\nIt shouldn't be important to OP unless the stepmom wants to do it in a healthy way.", "I don\u2019t think she necessarily wants to cut OP out but either way, I also said she was in the wrong. And either way, it\u2019s a big relationship in her kids lives and she should want ALL the big relationships in their lives to be good and healthy. So yes, it should be important that someone they are with half the time has a good relationship with them. \n\nAs a mom, my kids are my number one and their relationship with others effects them so they are important to me."]}
