NTA.\n\n>She told me her relationship with the kids is important though and I honestly told her it's not important to me\n\nOk that's slightly an AH thing to say. I get where you're coming from, especially combined with the annoyance of trying to make you disappear from these kids' life outside of your own home, but it's important for your kids too that they get along with their stepmother. Not more important than your relationship, but she's part of their lives. I wouldn't have said that.", "If she wants a good relationship with step kids maybe she should try treating their mom better instead of trying to cancel her out.", "Nta I can appreciate the stepmother making an effort with your kids (it's better than the opposite. ) But she's way out of line asking you to step back from activities work your own children. \n\nThere's nothing to indicate jealousy or \"hatred' on your part.", "NTA\n\nAt this point, I would go nuclear and get a lawyer.

As in for advice and sending a legal letter stating your rights and this woman's infringement on them.", "NTA. I dont think this request is reasonable at all. The expectation that you should stop supporting your children at their extracurricular activities just because someone else can also support them is ridiculous. Your ex\u2019s wife wanting to bond with the kids is nice but she should do so by planning her own activities with the kids.", "NTA -- I suggest you keep a record of her remarks -- what she says, when and where -- in case it is useful in a parental alienation claim in the courts.\n\nAnd to call you the baby mama is entirely weird since it is intended as an insult -- you are your children's mother, full stop.", "NTA\n\nShe wants to be a better mother by making you a worse mother. She thinks children's love is limited and to get some she has to take it from someone else.", "Ehhh... You are not the asshole here. \n\nI'm a stepmother and a mother in a blended family. \n\nMy MOM perspective: When my ex and I first split, he used to show up during activities I had with my son and try to horn in. I wasn't too happy about that. I left him alone during his parenting time, he needed to do the same for me. But if it were a school or sporting event, that was different - he can be there just as much as I could. I might not have liked it, but it wasn't my place to say no to that. And vice versa, but if it wasn't on my time I'd show up but  basically didn't take the lead.\n\nThe difference here is that this isn't stepmother's time, it's dad's time. If he passes it up, it doesn't go to stepmom. She's essentially not a party in this. \n\nMy STEPMOM perspective: Building that relationship is important - and that relationship is built up by spending time together and doing stuff together. His kids will have happier lives now and in the future if we have a harmonious family life now. I do that when they are here in our household. When stepkids have a major life event I need to support, I show up, with their dad. Only once have I been really cross with their mother over her presence, we were spending time as a family on our respective court ordered time doing an unofficial activity. She showed up to the fun stuff and interfered  - after she insisted we help her son with one of his chores as it was 'our weekend'.  She wasn't just interfering with my partner's time, but also with my time with my son. I was furious. She invited us around for lunch and I declined. I wanted my time with my family - and she is not a part of that. So there is definitely a line. \n\nQuestions to ask - are your kids' schedules so packed that there isn't much down time for them even in the other household? Did you agree as both parents on what activities the kids would do? Are you using your kids' activities to interfere with dad's time?  You might be doing nothing wrong at all. And I totally get what it's like to have an ex who does none of the hard yards of getting kids to events and activities that are important. My son has ONE sport. His dad has completely noped out of it. But I've also seen how my partner's ex doesn't give their kids a second to breathe (a times they had five or six scheduled activities outside school) and has deliberately scheduled things on dad's time to control the situation.", "She told on herself when she called you a \u201cbaby mama.\u201d She wants to become their mom and have you be their deadbeat egg donor.

NTA", "NTA she doesn\u2019t want to bond with your children, she wants to replace you. I think it\u2019s time to stop being so nice and put this woman in her place.

You are married to their Dad, that doesn\u2019t make you their Mom. If you wanted to fill the role of Mom, you should\u2019ve found someone who was either a widower or the Mom was not in the picture. If you keep being inappropriate and trying to intervene with MY kids, you will force me to take ex back to court and re-evaluate our custody agreement. Let me make it perfectly clear, you are not now, nor will you ever be their Mother. If you want to form a STEP-mother bond with the kids, you need to come up with ways during my husbands parenting time. But trying to kick me out of my kids extracurriculars and than having the GALL to act as if I did something wrong, will no longer be tolerated. This is your last warning. Ex, I don\u2019t want to put our kids or you through a custody battle, so I suggest you talk to your wife because I am DONE with this.

Use a parenting app in the future to document everything if you aren't already.", "NTA. She is totally in the wrong here, but maybe you can help her see the light for the sake of the kiddos.  Maybe sit them both down and explain that the kids need all the support they can get in their lives.  That you can ALL show up for events and that will only make the kids happier.  If they see the parents have a good friendly co-parent relationship, the kids are more apt to feel happy with how things are and build relationships with all of you without having to feel any guilt.  The tug o war with the kids is NOT in their best interest as it causes the kids stress they do not need.", "NTA at all. They\u2019re not a two-parent household. It\u2019s a one parent and spouse household. You\u2019re not replaceable. She seems to be confused what her role is.\n\nWhile I\u2019m not saying step parents aren\u2019t parents, the Step\u2019s role is to allow the relationship to develop organically, and with recognition that it\u2019s not a power play between them and the Bio. She doesn\u2019t understand hierarchy at all, and imo, is using your kids to fill her need to be a parent. She sounds like the jealous and hateful one. \n\nI probably would take the honey vs vinegar route of explaining to her that while I appreciate her love for my kids, it\u2019s not a case of her-vs-me. That her focus on needing me to be gone is detrimental to the kids, whom she claims to love so much. I\u2019d actually even try to befriend her a little bit, because I hate drama. Ofc, she could probably be one of those people who are so hellbent on drama that it wouldn\u2019t be possible to even forge a surface level \u2018friendship\u2019. But I would also keep records - emails/texts\u2026bc if she sticks around, she and your ex will one day blame you for their shitty relationship, and when your kids are older, you can show them and say \u2018hey, I tried\u2019. \n\nEither way, absolutely NTA.", "NTA Sounds to me like you a good mother.

The only thing you didn\u2019t handle well was saying that their relationship is not important. Even if it is true, I am not sure that that comment did anything but escalate the situation. But it seems like all your other comments were appropriate.\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly clear how you responded to her requests in the past. Did you just ignore the comment, then show up the next time? If that\u2019s the case, she may feel like you came to an agreement, and then you just dismissed it. So obviously, that agreement would be ludicrous, but it still feels like you\u2019re ignoring something that is important to her.\n\nHere\u2019s how I suggest you handle it. Again, the suggestion here is to **solve this problem**, not make a point of who is right or wrong. Because that\u2019s not the point \u2013 you guys need to coparent. So how can you expressed this in a way that\u2019s empathetic and that will get her to agree with you, and will make it so that you can move forward without drama in the future?\n\nIn essence:\n\n\u201cI understand and appreciate that you are trying to forge a bond with these kids. It does mean a lot to me that you care about this, and we should discuss the ways in which this can happen. There are some wonderful things that you can do with them on the days you\u2019re together. You could take them out for apple, blueberry, or pumpkin picking, paint together, make rockets or derby cars together, play basketball, make a picnic, go to laser tag, or any number of special bonding activities on your own. These one-on-one interactions could create lasting memories, and would be a special, private moment between you.\n\nSeparately, there are certain events in a child\u2019s life that divorced parents always come together to celebrate. Children love having as many parental figures as possible present when they are performing something they have worked on, like games or recitals. Even if only one parent \u201cneeds to be there,\u201d it is missing the point; the point is to support the kids. I wouldn\u2019t want either of us to miss these moments of their life, and the kids would be hurt if I did. The majority of divorced parental figures do find themselves attending these types of events together. It is a time for the entire parental team to come together, put aside their differences, and support the kids together. \n\nAlthough I support you forming a bond with them, excluding me from these important moments in the children\u2019s life (while well-intentioned) is not the most viable strategy or productive course of action. I would never exclude you from any of their recitals or plays or games. I would also feel terrible if the children ever felt that any of their parental figures was absent because another was there. There are many other strategies with one-on-one focus that would work far better to help you bond with the kids without pursuing this strategy. \n\nEither way, the idea of not attending important events isn\u2019t something most divorced parents would agree to. I would like to focus our efforts on working together as a team to work out the best strategy moving forward. Again, I apologize for being harsh before, and I do appreciate you wanting to build a closer bond with them both.\u201d", "This shit is made up bait.", "You are and aren't the AH.\n\nYou're not in that your relationship with your kids is the most important thing, but you've got a woman here who obviously really wants to be a good part of the children's lives and telling her that isn't important to you is an AH move.\n\nYou should want your kids to have a good relationship with her. \n\nWhat you need to do, is speak to her and say the most important thing for the kids is that all the adults get along as a united family. \n\nYou need her to realise trying to cut you out isn't going to work, it'll just cause conflict. \n\nTell her it would be better if mum and step mum showed they were a good team, that they get on well together and that would make the children more responsive to her.", "Esh\u2026.I was all for you until you said her relationship is not important to you.

She's allowed to attempt to build whatever type of relationship she wants with your children, as their father's wife and effectively their stepmother.   And it's nice that she does want something to do with the children, my ex's wife never does anything for my daughter. (Daughter is 9, this woman has been banging her dad since before she was born, Then they pretended not to be in a relationship, and then they were married two years later so...) I have tried, tried and tried to involve her in my daughter's life, But she is so standoffish that it's like she doesn't have any interest Unless bio dad is there as well.  She went into their relationship knowing that he was going to be a dad so I don't get it, oh well.  \n\nyou are NTA, Your kids stepmom sounds like a child who's behaving Like she has two toys that she doesn't want to share. She can involve herself as much as she wants to and legally can in the children's lives so long as they want her to, but she does not get to decide who you are as a parent. She does not choose how the children feel, and she does not control the children and their feelings. How embarrassing of her, Have you spoken to your ex about her behavior? Because it's pretty extreme.  \n\nGood luck OP!", "My stepson also likes me to spend time with him. His bio Dad has his faults like we all do, but he\u2019s smart enough to not be jealous over this. We have different relationships. In fact, not too long ago he invited me on \u2018his\u2019 weekend to go with him and my stepson to whatever the latest Star Wars film was to have a \u2018boys trip\u2019 thing.\n\nYou can\u2019t imagine how special that was for my stepson, to have his two paternal figures there chilling together with him at the centre of everything. And it\u2019s all because bio Dad was smart enough to let/make it happen.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that every parent should do that, I know that often there are real complications there. But I do think that any stepparent who tries to get in the way of the child\u2019s relationship with bio parents - or vice versa - is someone who has lost sight of the goal.\n\nOPs kids\u2019 stepmom can bond on her own time away from school or sports events, and it doesn\u2019t sound like OP has any problem with that. Making stepmom TA and OP absolutely NTA!", "Yeah, another stepmom here. I showed up for events and stuff but I could never imagine asking his bio mom to stay away. Our kiddo was generally pretty happy to introduce all of his adults to everyone, the more the merrier. NTA, this is weird behavior she's got going on there.", "This - you sound like a considerate caring stepmom for your stepdaughter. \n\nImagine if all adults would act like adults and truly act in the children\u2019s best interests.", "I agree. I have a stepson and my husband (father) and I show up to everything. His mother and stepfather don\u2019t always come to everything, but I would never tell them they couldn\u2019t. We are mostly friendly so we will always remain civil. We just want our (step)son to enjoy his time. So we would never spoil his special days. If he wants us all there then we will all be there.", "Never stop going, I wanted both my parents at events and it was quite nice to know they were both at these events footballs games etc, because they were never in the same place together otherwise, they stood opposite ends of the pitch and didn\u2019t speak but that didn\u2019t matter to me, both of my parents were there \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "This, step dad here without biological kids of my own.  The kids are grown now but I would never think of the kids bio dad as stepping on my toes.  He wants to be there, awesome, what\u2019s better than one parent? Two parents there.  There is an abundance of love and while step mom wants to get involved and have things with the kids, that\u2019s amazing, there is nothing that says that ex\u2019s can\u2019t get along and coparent together. \n\nThere needs to be a change in thinking, love and being possessive seldomly works out, even with kids.  At the end of the day, the parents are the adults and while there may be big emotions there, they come second to the kids, period.  It\u2019s all about the kids and making sure that they\u2019re loved and taken care of and have support.", "How much do you want to bet if/when she has kids of her own, all involvement with her husband's kids will evaporate? My kids have no desire to spend any unnecessary time with their SM, who does refer to them as her \"bonus\" kids, but she knows I come first to them. NTA, OP.  Keep supporting your kids!", "I get the stepmom's impulse here to form her own bond, but this seems like a really weird way to do it. Like, figure out your own thing to do with the kids. Recitals, sports games, etc. are pretty clearly all family things. NTA", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with it on the other end of things. I\u2019m also a stepmom, but I know I\u2019m one of the luckiest ones. My husband\u2019s ex is lovely and we have become good friends. She even comes to me for parenting advice. But it\u2019s because she is not threatened by me. This woman sounds like she is. I think any parent should be happy that another person loves their kids. In the case of OP though, the stepmom is being completely unreasonable. Those games/recitals are a moment in time that passes very quickly. Parents don\u2019t just go to them to support their kids; they go because they want to be there and watch. Because they *enjoy* it! My dad used to come to all of my events. He had an awful girlfriend who would say, \u201cYou\u2019ve seen her play tennis before, why do you have to go this time?\u201d It\u2019s about what\u2019s best for the kids. You sound like a great stepmom.", "I feel sorry for these children.  To put your own kid behind your petty squabbles isn't fair.  \n\nIn PA I had to go to a class on a Saturday when myself and my son's mother were going through custody arrangements.  They just spelled out that using children as leverage in the parent's relationship is a shitty thing to do.", "Pretty sure this story is fake. I read this exact story recently but written by a man about his kids\u2019 stepdad.", "That's what I was thinking. \n\nShe can't (reasonably) ask an involved bio-mom to ignore her kids' events just to give her \"solo mom\" time with them. What she CAN do is talk with the kids either together or individually and see if there's an activity they aren't currently doing that they'd like to try -- for example, cooking/baking together, playing a certain game (video or board game), going to a park together, having at-home dance parties, learning a craft, etc. -- that could become a regular thing that JUST stepmom and the kids do together. That way, she gets quality bonding time, you don't miss out on milestones and events, and your kids never think that someone doesn't care because they're not showing up. \n\nThis also prevents the kids from being in a position where they feel like they have to choose between mom and step-mom. They won't be thinking, \"Oh, my concert is coming up. If I don't tell mom, she won't come, but if she does come, step-mom is going to be upset.\"", "She wants to replace, not just be involved.", "OP, this.", "OP had already said that what ex is doing is not considered parental alienation within their court system. It seems that OP is also pretty involved in her kids lives and they seem to tell her all about their activities so that's good!", "She sounds like one of those step moms who are in those step mom groups on Facebook always talking about \u201chigh conflict bio mom\u201d when they\u2019re, in fact, the high conflict ones stuck on delulu island.", "Only to step in on her behalf. That's all he would do. He would never tell her she cannot ask me that or anything.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking as well clearly trying to push the kids mum aside hope OP is or starts documenting this", "I think it\u2019s absolutely alienation or at least sets the stage for it, if I were OP I would be talking to my lawyer and documenting this to nip it in the bud.", "Right. If someone tried telling me I should step back FOM MY OWN KIDS, I\u2019d look at her and then look around for who she thought she was talking to because...\u201dexcuse you, did I die? just because you married my ex doesn\u2019t mean you get to have my children as well.\u201d Since when do her needs trump those of the children? Id be setting some VERY firm boundaries.", "Actually, I do family law and the court order would be \u201cextracurriculars can be attended during your own parenting time\u201d if there really is an issue, so going to court might not be best.\n\nAlso \u201calienation\u201d is almost impossible to prove and there is no remedy. Not a path I would take.", "Why the hell would you involve a lawyer? Holy shit, OP can handle this annoying situation on her own, as she is already doing. Or is there some fantasy scenario you want to invent where the stepmom is trying to take custody or something?", "A lawyer for what???  People really are ignorant of the law. The best thst could happen is a cease and desist about asking her not to be there.  Expensive and worth less than the postage stamp to send. \n\nThe truth is mom should keep doing what she's doing. Exercising her rights and ignoring step-mom.", "Yeah if step mom is so concerned about creating a \u201cspecial bond\u201d then she should PLAN activities for the three of them (kids and step mom) to do together\u2026.NOT go out of her way to exclude their loving mother.

Quite a few times, teachers and friends didn't realize I was the stepmom until the one-time biomom showed up. I didn't pretend to be biomom, but i was the only one showing up. All our paperwork had dad, mom, and then me. \n\n People really don't realize how much children love seeing people who love them to show up for their events. My side of the family was a constant at my step and bio kids events. They loved having a big cheer section.", "She definitely feels like a bunny boiler.", "That's my plan. I will document incidents like these too because I can't be too careful with this.", "We do have a court order in place. We are not responsible for notifying the other of events like the ones I mention here. But doctors, dentist, etc, yes, or if a serious school related issue came up (like if our kids had IEP meetings, etc) then yes. We do have to both have access to the portal our kids school provides with all relevant dates for school related things. So we could not take each other off of that. That would be a violation of the order.", "That was the judge's response to my ex when he asked if showing up to the kids stuff like that would be based on the parenting schedule. He said being a parent does not stop on the others parenting time and it's not undermining to parent a if parent b goes to something for the shared kid(s) on parent a's time.", "True. She's going about this the wrong way. Pushing their mom away is not going to make them want her around more.

You're one of those. Completely unreliable and jealous.", "The points were made to them both.", ">Instead of ignoring her request, why don\u2019t you pull her aside and really talk to her about it.

Because of this issue I mostly try to keep us distanced from each other during these because she is bothered every time she sees me at one of them.

She was always very odd around me and a little hostile with me.", "I understand what you're trying to and definitely see your pov. But stepmom openly told OP not to come to these things. That would mean she created the hostile environment if there was one. Where does she (or any one for that matter) get off telling the mom not to show up to events for the children? Her saying they have a two parent household is all fine and dandy but parents who can show up for their kids and everyone should want that. I didn't get the vibe that OP was rude to her or at the very least not in front of the children.

Her creating a hostile environment is a different story though.", "It was not on their time.", "If her son asked HER to be there, it doesn't matter whose custody days were.

That's a pretty shitty thing to do to a kid.  It's ridiculous to expect a parent to support their child less than they were, simply to \"make room\" for the stepparent.  It's not like space in a child's heart is limited.  If your cousin's mom wasn't already attending every event and only started with the specific goal of boxing out the step then, yeah, that's kind of shitty behavior; but that's not at all the case here considering OP has always gone to all these events to actually support her kids, rather than as just a reaction to the stepmom.  Your cousin's mom's behavior also doesn't excuse his stepmom's.

My husband and his three kiddos mom (the kids live with us fulltime) get along well, we are respectful and share all info about the kids between us and brainstorm together and always present a united front for the children in any situation.

My sister was the apple of her eye. Her dad split when mom told him she was pregnant. When my sister was 5 1/2 mom had already met and was marrying my dad. My Nana was not happy. She tried everything to get mom to leave him. Mom told me she even went as far as to tell mom dad was abusing my sister because he was disciplining her which made her cry (my sister was very spoiled by Nana and he was trying to explain to her why she couldn\u2019t do what she wanted).\n\nFast forward and my sister is almost 12 and I just arrived in the world. From my understanding, my sister was excited to be a big sister and when I was born she doted on me and was always playing with me and even fed me while mom did chores around the house like cooking. For my sister\u2019s 12 birthday she spent 2 weeks with Nana and came back totally different. No longer wanted anything to do with me. One instance I remember mom and dad telling me was that one night mom was making dinner and I was getting fussy. She asked my sister to give me a bottle while she continues dinner. Sis said \u201cit\u2019s not my responsibility\u201d fair point. So my mo was like \u201cfine. I\u2019ll turn off the oven and the stove and continue making dinner after I take care of your sister. If you\u2019re hungry, tough luck\u201d. That was the turning point. My sister begrudgingly fed me while mom finished dinner. \n\nMy sister moved out when she turned 18. I was a blubbering mess. I was 6 years old and didn\u2019t understand why Sissy left. I didn\u2019t realize that she gave me the absolute bare minimum of attention until she moved out. \n\nMy Nana never treated me the way my Grandma treated me. There were pictures of my sister all over the house in various stages of life. There were only 3 of me. 2 in the living room and one by my grandad\u2019s bedside. The 2 in the living room were group photos. She was always looking down on me (which wasn\u2019t difficult when I was little) and plenty of times Mom and Nana got into arguments over it. The biggest one I remember was when I was 14. Mom had confronted her on why she always treated me differently from my sister. Why did she \u201ccorrect \u201c me for doing things she let my sister get away with when she was younger. It hit me then that it was because she didn\u2019t like Dad. While they were arguing, I just walked out the door. I was a couple of miles from my Grandma\u2019s house when a cop stopped and I had to go back to Nana\u2019s no matter how much I protested. \n\nAfter that I doted on Granddad but did the bare minimum with Nana. To this day I\u2019m thankful that I was too pregnant to attend her funeral. Sorry this turned into a novel, it just came pouring out.", "Thanks a lot! Just curious, would you have appreciated if you were in my stepdaughters situation, for your stepmom to communicate subtly that she steps back to respect that relationship?

Children are precious no matter the circumstance of their birth and should be treated so. They are innocent. It really takes a certain type of person be able to treat a child as badly has your Nana did you. My granny was bad but yours was worse I think. She may have encouraged my brothers to make fun of me but she never taught them to outright hate me. I hope one day your sister realizes how your Nana manipulted her and ask for your forgiveness.", "Yea, I would have loved for my stepmother to just communicate in general. Your SD probably sees that and appreciates the coparenting. My parents were terrible at the coparenting thing with mom trying, and dad/stepmother not even making an effort unless it was out of spite. The fact that yall get along is a huge sign of respect towards the mom. As long as you make it apparent or flat out known that you, mom and dad (also Step-dad if there is one) are on the same page as far as her wellbeing, happiness, and upbringing then everyone should get along and she will know shes loved. My Step-dad always made me feel loved and never tried to step on my dad's toes unless needed. (He was always forgetting birthdays, holidays, making guilt trips, forgetting weekends, etc) my Step-dad even found things that just we had in common to form a bond and somethings did overlap sometimes but he asked me if I wanted to do them or if I wanted my dad to take me instead of just doing them. The thing is, is that moms and stepmoms are different, and so the relationships are not going to be the same. The best thing to do for the child is to try to form your own bond and not copy/force the same bond they have with their mom or try to turn them into what you want. If my stepmother had not tried to force me into her vision of what a daughter was or if she had just tried to get to know me and who I am to figure out how to be in a SM/SD relationship I think it would have been better.", "Thank you for clarifying.

You don't have to abandon your kids but you mentioned years she has asked and you continue to go. There's nothing wrong with being there for your children, but there's also nothing wrong with encouraging a bond with a step parent if she's been around and isn't an awful person. It seems as if she wants to go to these events even though their father doesn't, and if she's a nice person, I would say that's commendable rather than being a vicious stepmother who ignores or tries to alienate the kids. When she's at home with your ex, the kids would naturally gravitate toward their father, just like they naturally gravitate towards you when you're around. And again I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that, but I can see where it would make her feel like a third wheel in her family... And step kids are part of her family too now. If you were willing to let her try, you can always tell your kids that you just want to give her the opportunity to feel needed. Of course you're under no obligation to do that, but unless she's an awful person or you just hate her, why wouldn't you want your kids to also know they have someone else that they can depends on if say something happened to you? I don't know why so many on this post act like the stepmom is practically committing a crime. It sounds like from what you said that she asked and that you just kept going. Did you discuss it with her or did you just keep going? If you didn't have open communication about how you felt and allowed her to have an opportunity to discuss how she felt then I can see how after the second year of asking you and you still just continuing to go could be upsetting.

Having people who want to love your children is always a good thing, she's just going about it poorly. Could you have a sit down conversation with her, maybe over lunch, where you tell her how much you appreciate that she genuinely seems to love your kids and wants to have a relationship with them? Explain that it is so important for everybody to be there for the kids and for the kids to know they have support from all of their parents figures. Tell her you want to encourage her relationship with them but, as another poster noted, telling your kids you won't be there for their special events because \"it's not your week\" will only hurt the kids, and no one wants that. Come at this from a loving and compassionate place. She lashed out and said things she probably regrets. Try the compassionate route first. It may not work, and then you can do all of the toxic, petty things suggested by other posters, but please try this route first.

I wish you all the best of luck.", "YTA - \"her relationship with kids is not important, mine is more important\".  This is adversarial and not a partnership, is possessive, and a missed opportunity to make your kids' lives better.\n\nUp to that point, NTA.  There's nothing that says that you both can't attend.  And by both attending without drama and in a friendly, accepting way would be major signalling to your kids and pave the way to more stable, positive interactions.  You would be saying \"hey, this person is in your lives, in a parental role, and you should consider her a parent\" plus \"I'm still your parent and I am not threatened or upset by this\".  So many children of divorced parents end up not wanting to celebrate major events because of drama generated by their parents/stepparents.\n\nWhen stepmom gave you her reasons, you should have agreed with her that it was important, but you think that showing the kids that you can share in major events is more important for them and then offered to help her with her goal in other ways.  She has the right goal, just the wrong methodology.\n\nYou don't have to be her friend, but if she genuinely cares about your kids and wants to be a positive influence in their lives, then you should support that and make an effort to bring her in as a partner.

If she is really is concerned for them, and not \u201cwinning\u201d the parenting contest she would just be graceful. She has every opportunity to have one on one time on their visitation time.

She handled everything for them on my ex's end. She, also, got pissed when I showed up for things, regardless of whose time it was. She got pissed when I decided my kids would not stay somewhere she was when they were not monitored simply because my ex wasn't available and she was busy. I stayed there until my ex showed up. \n\nThat being said, as a step-mom to kids whose mother only gets them twice a year, for a few weeks, I defer to her always.

Perhaps if you let them know that you appreciate her wanting to be a supportive parental figure and would support her in that aspect they will settle down a bit. \n\nConversely, you require that she and your ex-husband support and understand that your relationship with the children that you gave birth to and have been actively parenting is the primary maternal relationship that should be supported. This is really not an option, it is a requirement going forward in this situation.\n\nThey're trying to treat you like you're some long lost mother who hasn't been in your children's lives for the majority of it.

I'm not sure if step mom can have kids or not, but those are her issues to work through, not yours. \n\nTo me,  and this is my own personal opinion, it seems like she is trying so hard to replace you as their mom. Rule #1 of being a good step mom is knowing the biomom is not replaceable. It sounds like she wants everyone to think she is mom. Even with the crappy bio mom my kids had, she is still their mother, and I am still their bonus mom. \n\nI'm sorry, but this pisses me off so much.

She\u2019s threatened divorce over his mental and emotional abuse and gaslighting and manipulation over me and my mom  and the way he treats my dad too. \n\nAfter my mom passed, she just offered what she always has, her love and support. Never tried to move in and take her place, never tried to step more into the mom role. Over time, she slipped into that void a little and made the hole and the hurt feel a little less intense and I started calling her mom rather than her nickname I gave her at 13 when I met her. She calls me once a week to check on me, texts me every other day with little things that she saw or heard that made her think of me.

She knows my love and obsession for Assassin\u2019s Creed and is the reason I have almost every game ever released and remastered for either Switch or Xbox One.
