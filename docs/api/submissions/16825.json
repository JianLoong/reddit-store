{"id": 16825, "submission_id": "13d28nn", "title": "AITA for refusing to use personal hygiene products despite my GF's protests?", "selftext": "My GF (26F) and I (30M) have been talking about this for a while and it's been an amicable discussion as much as it can be at this point.\n\nEssentially, it does sound as bad as the title admittedly because ever since I was little (think early elementary school days), I've had an extremely odd revulsion towards any sort of artificial product. Artificial in this sense doesn't mean whether or not the ingredients are natural or not but basically anything made and sold for cleaning purposes, regardless of whether it's for personal hygiene or household cleaning. Think anything like toothpaste, bodywash, deodorant, clorox wipes, hand sanitizer, etc. I physically gag and am on the verge of throwing up with any toothpaste for example (regardless of the flavor, taste, etc.) and I have to hold my nose if forced to use any products. Smelling anything of the sort usually makes me extremely uncomfortable and I've thrown up when exposed to them for extended periods of time.\n\nTrust me when I say I do understand how unreasonable it sounds on the surface but to provide some context, I personally consider myself a very clean person - I shower usually twice a day on average, wash my hands thoroughly (with water) for 20-30 seconds each time, clean and vaccuum very often, etc. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I do make sure to be as clean as I can, just not with products, so basically everything is done with water. For further context and for what it's worth, I have never in my entire life had any comments on me being smelly or anything of the sort; I also barely get sick with my conscious efforts to promote cleanliness (knock on wood). \n\nMy gf also does admit to me always been very clean and not smelling ever. But as you can probably guess, she simply can't wrap her head around and accept the fact that I simply refuse to use any of the aforementioned products. \n\nAITA in this case?\n\n**EDIT (1) - I honestly appreciate everyone's insights more than they might know because it's refreshing to hear the different perspectives (most of which are at the bottom line I need to see a therapist on my issue).**\n\n**I would however, like to make one thing abundantly clear - from a specific visual and scent hygiene perspective, I have gotten respective insights from my dentist, doctor, brother, parents, GF, close friends alike that I do not smell even the slightest and nothing of the like. No dirty teeth, no smelly armpits, no stinky breath for a fact because this isn't the first time I've inquired on this and outside of genuine cleanliness issues, they've affirmed my confidence in the looks and smell department. So even if you personally can't fathom this and believe this, I would appreciate the understanding that this post is operating under the assumption that I don't look or smell dirty in the slightest.**\n\n**With that being said, I do understand the concept of not being able to literally clean everything off with just water though and this is something I will be willing to compromise. I'm thinking I'll use soap after any activity where bacteria is potentially more of an issue and I'll just hold my breath and wash for 2-3 minutes after so I can't feel or smell any of the remnants after.**", "created_utc": 1683657985, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13d28nn/aita_for_refusing_to_use_personal_hygiene/", "score": 242, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get having certain sensory aversions, but this is an issue you should be seeking professional help with. \n\nWashing your hands with just water actually does very little to reduce the amount of bacteria on them. The mythbusters did a segment on this which was quite nasty. Some of the bacteria on the human body can be harmless, but even if your gf can't smell you, that doesn't mean you are clean. If you guys are sexually active you can make her very, very sick with the bacteria that builds up on your nether regions. Hygiene is one of the main reasons people died so young in the dark ages. fwiw I also have an aversion to many cleaning products, the scents of most household cleaners make me puke, I can only use childrens toothpaste flavors, and any lotions or moisturizing soaps make me scrub off layers of skin. At a certain point you just have to find the products you can handle and get over it, the house needs to be cleaned and so does your body, if a little vom becomes part of the routine then so be it.

Artificial in this sense doesn't mean whether or not the ingredients are natural or not but basically anything made and sold for cleaning purposes, regardless of whether it's for personal hygiene or household cleaning. Think anything like toothpaste, bodywash, deodorant, clorox wipes, hand sanitizer, etc. I physically gag and am on the verge of throwing up with any toothpaste for example (regardless of the flavor, taste, etc.) and I have to hold my nose if forced to use any products. Smelling anything of the sort usually makes me extremely uncomfortable and I've thrown up when exposed to them for extended periods of time.\n\nTrust me when I say I do understand how unreasonable it sounds on the surface but to provide some context, I personally consider myself a very clean person - I shower usually twice a day on average, wash my hands thoroughly (with water) for 20-30 seconds each time, clean and vaccuum very often, etc. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I do make sure to be as clean as I can, just not with products, so basically everything is done with water. For further context and for what it's worth, I have never in my entire life had any comments on me being smelly or anything of the sort; I also barely get sick with my conscious efforts to promote cleanliness (knock on wood). \n\nMy gf also does admit to me always been very clean and not smelling ever. But as you can probably guess, she simply can't wrap her head around and accept the fact that I simply refuse to use any of the aforementioned products. \n\nAITA in this case?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My son is on the spectrum and has had weird aversions, so I don\u2019t think that alone makes an AH. I also dated a guy that wouldn\u2019t use deodorant and made his own laundry detergent. A bunch of stuff like that. He was on the granola spectrum. He did use toothpaste thankfully. He didn\u2019t stink, which was surprising. I thought it was weird at first but it didn\u2019t hurt anyone and saved him money. You can brush your teeth with straight baking soda also. There are ways to work around all of these things most people don\u2019t think of, because we\u2019ve never needed to. Some people are allergic to water but still maintain cleanliness. \n\nIf you are somehow really managing not to stink, I wouldn\u2019t start spending the money now. I just bought an $8 deodorant.

This reminds me of sensory processing issues, and I absolutely believe OP that he cannot stand the texture or smell of common cleaning products, and that he is otherwise very clean. However, cleaning your hands only with water is not hygienic, especially when preparing food, so GF has a very valid point here too. \n\nMy advice to OP is to try and think of any way he might be able to adapt his routine or the products he uses to minimise discomfort. If scent is the problem, are unscented versions better? If it's the texture of liquid soap, how about bar soap? Can he stand using hand sanitiser, foaming or liquid? What about exfoliating soap, with the little rough balls, is that texture distracting enough to avoid the nausea? \n\nI am sure that even if OP can't find a soap he likes, he'll be able to find a soap that is BETTER for him than the usual kind. Yes, he should definitely be using soap, but the insistence in these comments that OP has to just give in to being extremely uncomfortable is wrong. There is a compromise.", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain and say NTA but with qualifications. \n\nBrushing your teeth without toothpaste is fine. Water is fluoridated. The brush does most of the work. No shampoo is fine. Most of shower without soap is fine. \n\nBut two things you really need soap on are your hands and your butt. Wash your hands with soap when you use the toilet or touch food. Wash your butt with soap when you shower. Ivory soap is very low on the scent level. There are others too. \n\nSo if you can manage these two additions I think you\u2019re fine.", "Omg this actually is so helpful because we have this one coworker who absolutely REEKS and everyone talks about it when he isn\u2019t around.

We\u2019ve all been baffled but I sent this post in the group chat and now we\u2019re all convinced he must think soap os optional.\n\nYTA. Without soap you have likely been spreading illnesses, potentially to vulnerable people. You might think you don\u2019t smell, and your family/friends may have just gotten used to your smell, but that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t absolutely smell. They have adjusted to it and don\u2019t want to hurt your feelings, but there is no way oils aren\u2019t building up on your skin without the use of soap. Soap makes you want to throw up?
