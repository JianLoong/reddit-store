You have no obligation to do this. Sure it would be nice of you but you're right. And it would cost you something, you're losing a week's worth of income to spend the whole time working anyways.", "NTA. \nMy mom has a passion for Veterans causes. When she lived with me for 2 years, she wanted me to go to EVERY SINGLE THING that she went to. I had to explain to her that it was fine for me to go once in a while, but MY PASSION was dog rescue & dog transports. Your family may want to go build that house, & that is fine for them, but tell them it\u2019s just not your passion. How would they feel if you wanted all of them to do something YOU wanted, but they didn\u2019t enjoy?", "NTA. I wouldn't want to work during my vacationtime eather.\n\nI think it's admirable if they want to do it and have the acces energy for it, but it's ridiculous to assume everybody wants to spend their vacation time that way.", "Nta. You are not obligated to do that.", "NTA you work full time already, you aren't obligated to be a part of someone else's charity if you don't want to. It's great that people want to give back and all that, but that doesn't mean you bully someone who just wants to live their life into being as giving as you. Do your thing and kick up your feet. Let the people who actually want to build houses, build houses.", "NTA.\nLook it's a great idea in theory. It's not everyone's jive. Being pressured into using vacation time for a vacation YOU don't want is not okay. \nAlso there's a lot of controversy with voluntourism anyway.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are an adult... \"my dad wants it\u00a7 is not a sufficient reason. HE can go without you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't suck it up. You are entitled to maske your own life decissions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut if they harass you, have a lot less contact with hem.", "NTA. While a nice idea, service trips are deeply unethical in almost all cases. The money spent on airfare, housing, and food while down there would easily cover materials and labor for a local person to build the structure, giving a job to one or more people in the local community and ultimately recirculating that money into the local economy. \n\nNot to mention that most are also designed to evangelize and that ultimately causes massive damage (expectation of tithing, forcing people to carry children instead of getting access to healthcare like abortions or birth control, erasure of local culture, to name a few).\n\nNot to mention the quality of structures built by people who aren't normally construction workers is normally poor quality and the repairs become an unbearable weight to the occupants, causing them to abandon the homes, therefore wasting time, effort, money, materials, and causing psychological damage to people already struggling. \n\nThere are organizations that allow you to stay local to the US and do work in a structured way that will actually help people, like Habitat for Humanity, known for building extremely structurally sound homes for the needy population because they put a lot of effort into structuring the project in an accessible way.  Building a home in Mexico, with weaker regulations, in just a few weeks, does not meet those same expectations. \n\nThe road to hell is paved with good intentions.", "NTA. These \"mission\" trips are absolute bullshit. They displace skilled tradesmen from work they could be getting paid to do and in turn building often shoddy structure that doesn't last. All while these do-gooders get to take selfies and get praise for how \"generous\" they were. Volun-tourism is a plague.", "Are they calling it a \u201cmission trip\u201d and getting \u201csponsors\u201d to pay for the trip?  If so, you\u2019re supposed to feel \u201cguilty\u201d for not wanting to help the less fortunate. /s\n\nNTA", "Nta\n\nThat's not a vacation, vacations are to relax. If that's what you're father wants to do with his free time, cool, but he can't be mad that he's the only one that finds building a house for someone else *relaxing*.", "NTA, it isn\u2019t something you want to do and it isn\u2019t an obligation.", "NTA. Don\u2019t go if you don\u2019t want to go. But is it worth the drama of your family being upset?", "NTA, I totally understand your reservations about going.  \n\nBig picture to ask yourself though, how healthy is your dad? Do you as a family often get chances to spend extended time together as a group? Do you care to continue a relationship with them in the future?", "NAH\n\nI think your dad feels like this is a good project (and he's right) but for someone working more than full-time a working vacation doesn't seem a good plan. This is more like something you do with your teen kids.\n\nYou have different needs at this point in life. He needs to accept this.", "NAH.", "I don't think this is really about the vacation. Do you spend a lot of time together as a family? Did you used to spend a lot of time together, but then something happened (new job, moved out, life just got busy etc) and that changed? I'm sure your family is more upset over the implication, however wrong, that you don't want to spend time with them rather than the actual vacation.\n\nNTA, I don't blame you for not wanting to go. Half the time those charity projects that build a house or a school or a town hall or whatever in an impoverished country does more harm than good anyway. But I'd dig to the bottom of what the real issue is. If they just want you to spend time with them, there's better ways.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I can see why your family want you there, but you by no means have to go.", "I do have the paid vacation time, so it wouldn't cost me that. It's just working on my pto and not knowing the language i don't like", "Glad to finally see someone else mention this because honestly, these trips have their own issues", "My dad is quite healthy for 72. We do a group vacation every 2 years. I love my family and they do understand my hesitation but most still think I'm being a little selfish.", "I think the family has good intentions, but for me the judgment was NTA because when they ganged up and OP and pressured them they became the de facto AH's", "We do a family vacation every 2 years as a big group. My dad always pays for travel and the stay for everyone. It's usually close to where everyone lives and in a large VRBO home that can fit all of us for as cheap as possible. Sometimes that means kids are on mattresses on the floor.", "It'll probably cost OP vacation time. No one should be pressured into using their limited time off in a way they don't want.", "Make sure to send op your contact info so that you can take their place. They didn't volunteer, they attempted to guilt them and voluntold them.", "How many homes have you built in your spare time since you're being so generous with OPs PTO?", "Great, maybe OP can send you his family's info and you can take his place.", "It *would* cost you a week's pay to go spend your PTO working in another country.\n\nThat Paid Time Off is ***your*** benefit. It is intended to be used for *your rest and relaxation*. If you spend that week working, then you have lost that financial benefit (aka a week's salary).\n\nTell your family that you work 50+ hours a week, and you need to take a *vacation* \\-- but if they really want you to spend a week working in another country so badly, they are certainly welcome to give you a week's salary, and you will gladly take a week off with unpaid leave and come work with them. Tell them it's easy for them to be generous with *your* money -- but if they're as un-selfish and non-lazy as they claim to be, then they'll be happy to be generous with *their own money* and pay for you to do the work that they insist you should be doing.\n\nWatch them backpedal furiously when you say that.\n\nThen take vacation wherever you want, whenever you want, doing whatever you want -- and feel absolutely no guilt about it.", "That'll make it harder to justify to them then but still, you expect to have a bad time and you may very well come back feeling like you didn't get a vacation at all. Don't need more of a reason than that.", "It\u2019s not the least bit selfish.  You\u2019re allowed to not want to do everything your family wants to do.", "Isn't the vacation more about spending time with your family than it is about building a house though? And even building the house is a shared effort which would strengthen your ties.\n\nSo your family's reaction is understandable.  You don't want to spend time with them. I am not saying you are the asshole, just that your family may feel that you are. \n\nNot sure that that makes you an asshole but at least"]}
