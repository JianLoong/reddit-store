She of course said yes and they started planning the wedding. A few months had passed since the proposal and it was the awaited day of their wedding.\n\n I, as one of the family members, went to visit my uncle in his room. He was on his phone the entire time and I didn\u2019t think much of it then. When I was watching the video of my uncle saying a few words for his bride, his voice was monotone like he was reading a grocery list. Most people didn\u2019t notice and just told each other he was nervous etc., I was slightly suspicious but I just kept quiet. When it was the time for the wedding, we noticed my uncle looked bored and out of place. \n\nMe and my cousin were talking about it until the bride started to walk down the aisle. Everyone was all smiles but my uncle. He wasn\u2019t crying or smiling brightly. He didn\u2019t smile at all. When it came to the question \u2018Should anyone present know of any reason that this couple should not be joined in holy matrimony, speak now or forever hold your peace\u2019, one woman said \u201cI object\u201d. \n\nPeople were shocked and the woman started to speak. \u201cPlease, (uncle\u2019s name), come back to me. I know you still love me!\u201d She begged over and over again. My mouth flew open as my uncle caved and walked towards her. Marie immediately (and reasonably) broke down. Marie and I were good friends, so I obviously felt obligated to step in. \n\nNobody else did, so I just held my tongue. While the groom and the other woman started to walk down the aisle, I just told them something I shouldn\u2019t have once they passed me. I told them \u201cYou\u2019re an a-hole and I hope you\u2019re never forgiven.\u201d Slipped out of my mouth and I bit my tongue when I had realized what I said. My uncle looked at me with wide eyes and he just walked away faster. Nobody has had any contact with him at all and I think it\u2019s my fault, because the best man had pinned the blame on me for my uncle cutting contact with the family after what I had said.

Why would he even consider marrying someone when he's not over someone else. That's just betrayal on so many levels.\nHe porbably hasn't contacted anyone out of shame (understandably). I mean imagine organising a wedding, getting family and friends together only to abandon the bride in front of everyone for another lady. That's beyond cringe worthy. Just ignore the best man trying to blame you. He's just bring irrational and emotional.", "NTA\n\nYour family and other guests should do the same, but it looks like they see no problem with your uncle being an a-hole...", "NTA your uncle is honestly an idiot for what he did and you were the only one brave enough to say anything and if that actually is the reason for him cutting contact with the family that just shows what a hypocrite he is", "A 15-year-old's comment is not the reason he isnt in contact. Its because he's embarrassed, ashamed and doesn't know how to explain his actions to his family. You have nothing to do with it. The best man just didn't know how to defend his buddy's actions and decided to blame a child.
