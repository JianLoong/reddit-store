Together they had my little sister Roselie. Last year, A year after me and my mom found out about the affair, my mother died unexpectedly in a car crash. This pulled me closer to my dad since he was my only other parent I had, whenever we went out as a \"family\" together though, him and Chelsea would always find a way to leave without Roselie, making me take care of her until they came back. I told myself that taking care of a two year was hard and this gave them a break for a tiny bit, but this started to happen everytime to the point where sometimes they would leave her on my front door step with all her stuff, leaving me with no choice but to take care of her. A few weeks ago, the day I called the police for child abandonment on them, was when I told them I wouldn't be home and was going out with some friends, they said that was fine but when I was about to leave the house I opened the front door to find my sister at my doorstep again with all her stuff, making me Furious, I called them to get sent to voicemail, I texted them to get left on read, by then my sister was in my living room watching some cartoons after an hour or two there still wasn't no sign of them so I canceled my plans with my friends. After about another hour I got fed up and called the police telling them what happened that morning, the police came to my house to ask me more questions, and I told what has been happening for these past few months, they asked for a description of them and there address and left. An hour passes by and the police station calls me asking me to come there with my sister and all of her stuff, once I was the there I saw my dad and Chelsea in handcuffs. The two were shouting at me and calling me an asshole for not taking care of my little sister.\n\nRight now my sister is in my custody and in a few days I'm going to court to testify against my dad and stepmom so AITA?", "created_utc": 1667353790, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjs4p1/aita_for_calling_the_police_for_child_abandonment/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There was another post like this recently as well. What if you hadn\u2019t been home like the other poster? Who does that??", "NTA - They cannot just drop a small child off with people expecting them to babysit with no prior agreement. Worse they didn\u2019t even verify she got inside your house before they left, a child that young can quickly get into trouble if not supervised. If what they did was ok they would have received custody of your sister immediately and not been handcuffed. You did the right thing.", "I think in your heart you know you\u2019re NTA. Some people refuse to change unless something changes. Your call to the police was a catalyst - and holding your dad and his mistress to account will benefit your half sister in the long run.", "NTA. They literally did abandon their little daughter. They counted on your good nature to get away with it. Lo and behold, they didn't get away with it. I wonder if they have learnt their lesson now?", "NTA!!! you did the best thing you could\u2019ve done for that little girl", "NTA. They fucked around and found out.", "NTA. You\u2019re a hero. I can\u2019t imagine the neglect your sister has had to endure.", "Absolutely NTA. They are *horrible* parents.  Who the fuck leaves a toddler on someone's doorstep? What if you were already out for the evening? You could have been picked up and left your car at home, so how would they know you were even home? They 100% endangered their child. \n\nYou did the right thing.", "NTA. They literally abandoned your sister.", "NTA Right away I think what would have happened in an emergency with them not responding to your call/text.", "NTA- they should have never done that. Also, you tried to reach them before calling the police. You gave them a chance. Imagine what would of happened if you left early.", "NTA Firstly, I am so very sorry to hear about your mother's passing at such a young, difficult age. I understand why you decided to work on your relationship with your father since he's your only parent now, but your father is the biggest asshole of them all.\n\nThey are using you, and I am so glad that you had the confidence to stick up for yourself and do the right thing. It's bad enough that they keep manipulating you into watching their baby, but it's horrifying that they just dropped a newborn off on your doorstep and left. They had no way of knowing what would happen, there are so many ways this could have ended badly. You even gave them a chance to come get her, which is far more than they deserved. These people are not good parents, and the authorities needed to know what is happening. And now CPS will surely be involved.\n\nYou are so brave for contacting the authorities and testifying against your father. Whenever you doubt yourself, just remember that you are protecting your little sister, and that is all that matters in the end. There's also a very strong possibility there are other issues you are not aware of in regards to your father and stepmother, everyone I've known who has done something similar to this has had other reasons the baby was in serious danger (abuse, drugs, alcoholics, etc).  No sane, stable person would ever pull something like this.", "NTA I\u2019m glad your sister has someone in her life to put a stop to this, it only would\u2019ve gotten worse as she grew up I just hope they can\u2019t turn her against you", "NTA. I'd be surprised if your sister wasn't neglected in other ways. I'm so worried for her future with parents like that.", "NTA, likely should have called earlier, you cant leave a child at the door step that is horrible parenting on OPs dad", "NTA if the police had the same reaction, then you have no reason to feel bad about getting screwed over", "NTA.  Hell, what if you'd let early with a friend and that kid sat outside your home for hours?  This is seriously dangerous behavior.  I feel bad for the kid.  I'm sure you do as well, but childcare is the responsibility of her parents, not you.", "Absolutely NTA. Maybe this will teach them that shitty actions have consequences.", "NTA, your dad and Stepmom should be ashamed of themselves. They had no concern for your time but also their own child's safety. What if you decided to leave later than you did? How long would it have been until you noticed Roselie was there? The fact that they left her there without at least waiting to see you opened the door is so wrong. You did what you could, you tried to call and this was not the first time they've left her at your doorstep. Choices have consequences, just because they don't like them, does not mean you're an asshole.  Good luck testifying, hopefully the judge will knock some sense into them!", "This sub is being completely ruined by these stupid fake posts. In a bad movie, the police might cuff mom & dad and let them scream at you from across the police station while you clutch their baby, but not in real life. Nor would they leave the child with you while they go arrest them for and charge them with abandonment, and they would not have you then surrender said abandoned child to the police\u2026 And all that aside, you also wouldn\u2019t be testifying against them in a criminal trial mere weeks after this nonsense. r/quityourbullshit", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They're disgusting to do that to you and the little one. She needs a safe, caring home life and with them she ain't getting it.", "NTA", "Definitely NTA and it sucks they put you in that position.", "NTA what if you had already left? Or were feeling sick and canceled your plans and didn\u2019t go out and find her? She could have been in real danger.", "NTA. Omg I am sorry sorry you are going through this.", "It\u2019s baffling, like what if OP hadn\u2019t been home? Who knows what would have happened to the kid.", "Or, maybe not left at all! What if op got sick, or got a text the plans were canceled. I don\u2019t remember reading that op has a doorbell camera or any way to know that baby sis is outside besides opening the front door\n\nyeah- NTA", "I was going to respond something very similar to this. It sounds more like a plot outline to a school class project, but there is a lot of stuff missin, such as all the real things that happen in a situation like this. They wouldn't just arrest the parents and leave their 2yo daughter in her siblings care, let alone keep them in jail while the case is fastracked through the court. There is a ton of investigation that would happen, with the possibility of the parents getting penalized in some way, but this is not it.", "Also, browsing this subreddit you would think that like tons of minor children have a dead parent. This is not super common in my experience. In my high school there were like 2 students that had lost one or both parents. On this subreddit it\u2019s like 30%. Tragic accidents all over the place."]}
