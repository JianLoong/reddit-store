This is one of my favorite things about Alamo Drafthouse.   \n\n\nIf you can't go two hours without talking or using your phone, you don't belong in a movie theater.", "Of course you're NTA. Alamo Drafthouse is very clear that you need to shuttup in their theatres. They were out of line for waiting for you after the movie.", "NTA, it's very annoying when folks behave badly in the theater. Light laughing or asking to pass the popcorn is fine but keep all else to a minimum. And for the love of all that's cold and refreshing, put your phone away!!!", "NTA\n\nI also get management involved at theaters. After tickets, popcorn, and cokes, I'm close to $100.  No way I am listening to some chucklehead talk over Oppenheimer.  Get stuffed, fool!", "NTA \n\nThey knew the rules of the theater before buying tickets. Also the fact that other movie goers reported them means that you were not overreacting to the situation.", "NTA\n\nI'd have done the same.", "NTA but they are. They didn't like being called out on their rude behavior. You paid to view a film where rules protect an enjoyable environment. They need to go somewhere else if this is too difficult to follow.  I'm glad the other group spoke up. It's okay to call out folks on their behavior.", "NTA\n\nTheir inability to behave appropriately in public isn't your fault even though they were crass enough to make it your problem.", "NTA\n\nYou reported them.  So did others. They are the problem.", "Rules are rules and they failed to adhere to them.\n\nNTA", "NTA and this is absolutely terrible from Alamo letting them confront you. Email them.  \n\nFor people who don't know, Alamo Drafthouse is a bumass dining movie theatre with terrible seating. Their main sell is dining and no talking/texting. They've gone viral for this. However, throughout the movie you'll constantly hear people ordering, waiters bussing, eating, chewing and what not. Least they can do is enforce the no talking, texting rule and have some security measures. Especially since you're running it in TX.", "NTA the Alamo even premovie advertises in a funny way in every showing that texting and talking gets you kicked. Miss being in Austin just for having that option.", "Absolutely NTA. Cinemas are sacred spaces. You have my full support for telling on them - assuming you asked them directly to stop talking first that is\u2026", "NTA. I am a chronic movie talker (at home, obviously), also an avid Alamo goer. Me and my sister just write notes on our little order cards throughout if we have something we wanna say to the other. Ours for the Little Mermaid were full up, and it\u2019s kind of fun without fucking stuff up for the other people going.", "Assuming you said \"shush!\" at least once to no avail before reporting, you are my hero and I hereby invite you to come to sit in the theater whenever I go to the movies so I can actually hear and pay attention to...I dunno...the movie and not the conversation going on next to me.\n\nNTA!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you want to talk throughout a movie, stay home and enjoy it from your own couch.

I've been lucky, I guess, and the two or three movies I've actually gone to see at a theater in the past few years have been attended by sensible, polite people.
