You should have a conversation with them and explain that you clearly did not understand how hard it was for them to pay for your dance lessons and ask them directly what they can and cannot afford.

Where I do think the parents are wrong (and I mentioned this already) was that they are demanding she return everything and give them the money. That will hurt the lesson. She has to decide to help of her own will and with her own money. They can't just declare it's their money like jerks.  They should let her keep everything.

It doesn't mean they have to be devoid of character and self-indulgent and it certainly doesn't mean that the child gets to do whatever they want or shouldn't manage money well.", "What your going through makes me look like I dropped an icecream cone after eating the icecream \ud83d\ude33", "No, it is completely unreasonable to put the burden of rent and bills on your child. OP is 14 years old she should not be in the position of choosing between using her hard earned money for necessities or for fun shit. \n\nHer parents arent hard up for cash to the point of not being able to keep the lights on because she can go to dance at all - i could maybe see them asking that she /help/ pay for dance as its an expensive sport but shes /already/ doing that by buying her own equipment.", "So you are one of those 'I made you so you should take care of me' parents? It's the PARENTS' responsibility to take care of the kids they have chosen to have.", "No they should be proud of there child's initiative.\n\nThey should be doing better.", "It might have been at least a little understandable if they had told OP in advance but OP says that they were told multiple times and didn\u2019t say anything so it\u2019s unreasonable for them to suddenly demand it", "How are they teaching her money management when they can't manage their own?", "ah not really but lets just hope both our situations get better!", "Also circumstances change. Folks lose jobs, get sick, etc so they could have started out ok but are now struggling", "I'm actually not, but having been extremely poor and helping pay my family bills I am a little more sensitive to the needs of families versus personal nonessentials", "Having financial trouble and deliberately mismanaging money are two different things. I know a person who lost every apartment they were in because if it was between buying an Iphone for a thousand dollars and paying their light bill, they'd do the first one.  That's bad management.  I have also had several things in my mother's house break one thing after the other and she had no money for these unexpected emergencies so she got help from her children.  That's financial trouble. There is nothing in this post to indicate poor management on the part of the parents.", "yep <333", "Considering his daughter's money his is a very good indicator that at least the father is bad with money. Asking for help when there are emergency situations is different.", "There's nothing to indicate that he's bad with money but like I said they're hurting an important lesson by simply acting like the money is theirs. It's not and they shouldn't make her return her stuff and demand the funds. She earned it. It's her money and they're acting authoritarian while subsequently robbing her of the chance to see opportunities to help and manage money better."]}
