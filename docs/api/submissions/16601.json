I wanted my older sister to come as well,  but her husband is active in conservative political circles and works for a GOP affiliated organisation, and all of us except for my brother and his wife are queer, so we don\u2019t want to be around him. I told my sister that she\u2019s welcome to come on her own and I would actually really like that, but that he\u2019s not allowed in my presence as long as he does what he does, which is a danger to the people that I care about.\n\nShe\u2019s turned this into an entire family drama and my mother and father are saying that I am being cruel by making my sister choose between her marriage and spending time with me. From my perspective she\u2019s entitled to be with whoever she wants, but she can\u2019t expect that nothing will change in our relationship since she\u2019s chosen to marry someone who stands for things that I not only find personally repugnant but that are dangerous to my lifestyle. I feel like I\u2019m being tolerant enough by keeping her in my life, since from my perspective associating with a bigot let alone marrying him is an enormous betrayal of me, and the fact that she doesn\u2019t understand that is making me reconsider having her in my life to begin with.\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that we have had this conflict, but in the other situations it was family get together that I disinvited myself from, like my brother, his wife and I did Thanksgiving separately from my parents this year because they insisted on allowing my sister\u2019s husband.

They are always rolling back health and safety rules in many places and allowing less checks and balances in the courts. \n\nYou and your friends are entitled to a safe and healthy trip without worrying about judgement from someone who works for a party where many actively and aggressively hate people like you.

Most families have a difficult member, but we don't exclude them out of love for our siblings.

You\u2019re by no means forced to like someone, especially if they cross any kind of emotional, mental, political etc etc boundary.\n\nHowever, YTA for even reaching out to your sister and inviting her but uninviting her husband considering 1.

You shouldn\u2019t have invited her in the first place.", "INFO: You say your brother-in-law works for a GOP affiliated organisation. Has he spoken out against your lifestyle and/or personally insulted you?", "INFO: Has her husband ever done anything bigoted or homophobic to you or the people you care about?", "Cool story, bullshit as usual in this sub\u2026", "[deleted]", "INFO: Has he ever expressed any anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment? Has he talked about the reasons he supports the GOP, and if so, so they include the reasons you want to disinvite him over? \n\nI\u2019m sympathetic to your side here, especially since it is your celebration. At the same time though, the strict two party system in the US make this by default difficult to judge. If someone is pro-LGBTQ+ rights but say, also pro-gun and economically more conservative, they are pretty much forced to pick against some aspect of their beliefs when being politically engaged. This gets even more complex if their jobs are supported more by one party or the other. I know people who hate a lot of what Republicans stand for but still vote that way or throw some support that way because they feel they have to given careers they\u2019re in and how particular policies will affect those, for example. \n\nAlso if you want to work in politics and don\u2019t live in a swing state, you can kind of be pushed to working for a specific party. I once had dinner with a Democratic politician whose family was also heavily involved in politics and her advice for those wanting to get into the door for political work was to do whatever low level work they could for EITHER party, even if they disagreed with said party. If you live in a red state, you campaign for Republicans even if you\u2019re not one until you get in a solid enough position experience wise to switch.  And indeed, I know several people who did just that. It\u2019s unfortunately how the game works. \n\nUnless someone *truly* toes the party line on every single issue, supporting one or the other doesn\u2019t say much about their bigotry levels unless they supplement it with words and actions. \n\nTo further hammer home the point: I have cousins with a similar conflict right now. Cousin K is upset at his sisters for voting Republican when he\u2019s gay. Said sisters paid for his wedding to a man, adore his spouse, and have been nothing but supportive. They never speak against his community and defend him from critics, but simply align with the GOP on other metrics. He has painted them as hateful bigots on social media. I on the one hand understand his frustration as technically how they vote hurts him, but I also think his portrayal of them is overboard. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case with you and your BIL because there\u2019s not enough info.\n\nThe TL;DR of my comment is that politics is not black and white even though it\u2019s structural form in the US treats it as such. People and their beliefs are often nuanced/complex in a way that is simply not allowed to be expressed structurally. They may have multiple beliefs and interests that map them to different parties on an issue by issue basis,   but the system pretty much forces them into an either/or. This means a lot of people are going to tacitly support things they may not want to, and the pertinent question is \u201cdo they genuinely believe x bad thing, or is this a bitten bullet for other factors?\u201d If you have reason to think the former, you\u2019re N T A.
