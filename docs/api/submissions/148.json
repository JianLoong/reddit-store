He loathes Thanksgiving - he's a picky eater and doesn't like any of the options served except turkey, but even then he insists that my family doesn't cook it right. He is NC with his side of the family except for his brothers so him going to see his family is not an option.\n\nMy sister recently moved closer so this year Thanksgiving is being held at her new house. This is the only reason the holiday came up this early. I was showing him pictures of the house from the old zillow listing and mentioned that I didn't want to overwhelm her by visiting so early in moving in and that I'd just wait to see it for real at Thanksgiving. My husband grumbled something about having to attend and talk with my family. He is barely tolerant of my extended family (he doesn't like their conversation topics, saying they all talk about themselves, they only talk about 'old people things', they say the same things every year, afaik they have never said anything rude to him personally but he still isn't crazy about my side) and will just kind of hang out and talk to my dad or brother or play with my nieces/nephews. \n\nEven if he did have a good conversation with my dad or played with my nephews he will still complain about having to see people he doesn't care about and see all the 'gross food' we all eat. It is so difficult to listen to year after year. After he complained for a bit I told him to just not come for thanksgiving if he hates it that much. He sees all the members of my family that he likes for christmas anyway. He looked offended at my suggestion and asked if I didn't want his company. I told him I love him being around but not when he's not having fun and is going to complain at the end. He said I hurt his feelings to even suggest that he not come with me to something he's invited to. I told him if he's not having fun at an event that he has no obligation to attend he doesn't have to come. He still insists that he's hurt and that he thinks now that I don't want him there.

He is barely tolerant of my extended family (he doesn't like their conversation topics, saying they all talk about themselves, they only talk about 'old people things', they say the same things every year, afaik they have never said anything rude to him personally but he still isn't crazy about my side) and will just kind of hang out and talk to my dad or brother or play with my nieces/nephews. \n\nEven if he did have a good conversation with my dad or played with my nephews he will still complain about having to see people he doesn't care about and see all the 'gross food' we all eat. It is so difficult to listen to year after year. After he complained for a bit I told him to just not come for thanksgiving if he hates it that much. He sees all the members of my family that he likes for christmas anyway. He looked offended at my suggestion and asked if I didn't want his company. I told him I love him being around but not when he's not having fun and is going to complain at the end. He said I hurt his feelings to even suggest that he not come with me to something he's invited to. I told him if he's not having fun at an event that he has no obligation to attend he doesn't have to come. He still insists that he's hurt and that he thinks now that I don't want him there.

If he feels this way, planning in more control and authority into his behavior might help. Besides leaving early/arriving late, maybe there is someone at the events that he does like or has something in common with, and he can plan to do something with that person at the event, ahead of time.

At restaurants, even those known for seafood or cheese-covered shit, I can almost always find something to eat. The only exceptions so far have been sushi places, I can't stand the smell and I don't know what anything is but I know almost all of it has some sort of seafood in it. If I'm with people that FUCKIN LOVE seafood, I'm going to tell them they can do that without me or I'm going to find somewhere else to eat and they can come with me if they want. I do say this with less of a \"my way or the highway\" of an ultimatum but almost everyone that knows me also knows that I'm not going to a fish market or a sushi restaurant so it's not been much of an issue.\n\nWhen it comes to home-cooked meals, I recognize that if someone else is cooking, they're doing it for all involved, not just me. If it's someone I know, I might ask if they have any problem with my eating before as I'm not cool with a lasagna or whatever, and almost of them have been so kind and thoughtful to have an additional thing that I can eat as well. A family friend was making some sort of spaghetti dish with shrimp and this white sauce that looked like cum and I asked if they would be okay if I just ate beforehand and she countered by offering to make ordinary spaghetti with meat sauce. Turns out more people like what she made me lol.\n\nWith all that said, if some woman decides I'm worth more than 6 months of her time and I chill with being 34 going on 64 and being a curmudgeon, she's going to know before our first date what my food deal is. I'm open with it. If she accepts me as I am, she's going to have to take the bad with the good just like I do with her. She won't get to hold this over my head and complain about it.\n\nIf I have a gf whose family is cooking the cheesiest lasagna with cheese-sticks instead of breadsticks, mozzarella sticks, cheese dip, and a fuckin cheese sampler board - because everyone except me loves cheese - I would assume I was not invited and be glad of it. I would tell my gf I understand she's addicted to cheese with the rest of her cheesehead family, and wish her well.\n\nIf this was done over a holiday gathering, like Thanksgiving or Christmas, I would wonder if it was on purpose to not include me because every single one of those people would know I don't eat cheese.

I've spent many a holiday alone because of my complicated relationship with my own family and usually joined partners' family celebrations rather than traveling to see my own.

That's fair reason to tell someone not to come, and fair reason to assume they wouldn't want to.\n\nWhat might be shitty is leaving someone behind if a holiday brings up some hard emotions for them (like if they lost someone on that day, it's the first since a loss, or they have painful memories) and they struggle to be \"fun\" enough, or if the family is legitimately rude to them for unfair reasons. Sitting out a holiday you dislike isn't the same thing as being excluded from a holiday and forced to spend it separated from your partner (especially if they're your only \"family\"). In those cases where it's simply emotional or uncomfortable, it's probably better to get through it together or both sit it out until it isn't such a high-conflict or emotional situation. But here?

Usually we plan an escape for him so he can show his face out of politeness, and then hide out somewhere.

Have you had a serious conversation with him about how all this relentless negativity towards your family is affecting you personally?

But if he is otherwise a good partner it could help to approach it from that direction and encourage him to maybe see a therapist", "Does he realize that you\u2019re an actual person with your own life, not a supporting actor in his life movie about himself?\n\nLeave him at home and if he complains about you \u201cnot wanting his company\u201d tell him he\u2019s damn right you don\u2019t! Why should you have to have him along, complaining about the food and the rest of your family, ruining it for you? What is this. Dude needs to grow up. If he really just doesn\u2019t enjoy Thanksgiving, then he should own it and plan his own movie day with a frozen pizza or something. I\u2019ve spent Thanksgiving that way and it\u2019s actually pretty awesome. Instead he\u2019s hell-bent on making it a miserable experience for you and everyone else.", "It\u2019s hard for him to understand that you like your family?", "Has he ever gone to therapy to explore these feelings and issues surrounding why he\u2019s NC with his family?", "Why are you married to this person? What's good about your relationship that makes you put up with this behavior?", "How can you stand to be around him for extended periods of time? He sounds exhausting.", "[removed]", "Or. You know. If they don't do the turkey right he could offer to do it?", "Precisely. The idea is to enjoy the holiday, not to get fussed over some idea of a \u201cperfect\u201d holiday", "I totally agree.  He goes and won\u2019t eat, acts like a child.  She says he can take his own food, no from him.  She gives him the OK to stay home, he\u2019s throwing a fit.  It\u2019s like he\u2019s tried nothing and is totally out of options.  I think isolating her from her family (like he is) and making her as miserable as he is is the goal.\n\nMy Dad was like this to an extent.  He\u2019d go places and make everyone miserable, because he was jealous and controlling of my Mom.", "Good for him that he's in therapy.  However, trauma does not excuse jerkish behavior.\n\nHopefully the therapist will teach him about social politeness and no thank you bites.  It shouldn't be your job.", "I don\u2019t need to know details, but he can\u2019t throw his trauma around as a reason as to why no one can enjoy thanksgiving.", "If there\u2019s trauma around family and food which is made worst around Thanksgiving, this may be a good topic for him to work through with his therapist. Especially since this is the first thanksgiving since working with one.", "I was going to ask if there was some kind of cultural/racial aspect to him calling the food gross. But I can see how trauma can impact his perceptions.  I have ARFID but I don't go around complaining other people's food is gross all the time (in fact I can absoloutely see why something looks/ tastes good, I just couldn't even attempt to eat it) meals with extended family can be difficult (and even immediate family). I have to manage my eating and it isn't okay to complain to on the way home how gross it was.\n\nSee if he would be willing to attend a therapy session or 2 with you to discuss how his constant complaints after a family event is exhausting for you and ruins the festive feeling. Its making you dread taking him, this is a big problem.\n\nHis behaviour could also be some unresolved  jealousy from not  eing able to be with his own family (not even the actual people that makeup his family, but the concept of his own family).\n\nYou have a few potential solutions that I see\n\n1)therapy together to talk it out\n\n2)his comes but he is not allowed to complain to you (caveat- unless something bad actually happens)- he can complain all he wants to his therapist, which would be healthier. They should help him come up with better coping mechanisms. He needs to bring some food to eat in the car before and after if he isn't able to eat at the meal.\n\n3)he gets involved in making the food. Either volounters to cook and bring 1-2 side dishes that will fill out his plate and make him less hungry. (His hanger isn't helping him emotionally regulate). Or volunteer to go to relatives house to assist and make a dish or 2. Something simple and easy and fits in with is safe foods. Potatoes!  \n\n4)if you can do the therapy together, agree to the no complaining and have him make something. Thast the best option. Then perhaps see about (with the agreement of your family) that next thanksgiving is at yours and he can cook whatever he wants.  If he's cooking and hosting perhaps he'll have less to complain about. He'll have nearly 2 years of therapy under his belt. And 3 by the thanksgiving 2024 so hopefully he is able to attend at others homes and be okay.\n\n5)are there any activities at your family thanksgiving? Could you encourage the group to participate in some? Then there would be less chitchat time. As well as some bonding activities which might help him feel more a part of the extended group. My family holiday have no activities there is just food and talking and at some point they will put on the football if they can get away with it or follow it on their phones. I hate it. I find it excruciatingly boring! Suggestions - board games, pub quiz, family walk, themed scavenger hunts etc (look on pinterest)", "To be honest, this makes him sounds even more selfish. Just because he has a problem with his family, he seems to think you shouldn\u2019t see your family either.", "His trauma does not make him entitled to insult you and your family, and ruin the one time a year that you get to spend time with them. It is not his fault, but it is his responsibility to manage.", "Maybe he's acting out a bit as deep feelings get brought to the surface?\n\nYou're completely right in how you're responding though. He ought to read some Captain Awkward advice. Several of her posts are about managing your emotional needs on holidays when you've had a tough upbringing.", "Same here. The day went down in family history. It was absolutely insane. Forcing children to eat unappetizing foods when they actually have sensory or anxiety issues around them backfires spectacularly. I eat a much more varied diet as an adult, but still feel like I need to overeat on foods I do like because I don't know if there will be something I can get down at the next meal. I used to lose several pounds at sleep away camp because some of the counselors tried to enforce \"no thank you helpings\" before you could make a sandwich.", "Nah that last sentence makes it clear they aren\u2019t talking about the good ones - because the good picky eaters do sort their own food and don\u2019t make a fuss.", "I see reading comprehension isn\u2019t your strong point, because you\u2019re asking a question I already answered. Non-vocal one\u2019s that accommodate themselves without troubling the group are fine. Everyone here is complaining about the vocal ones like the husband.\n\nPeople like you are knee jerk attacking people and calling them bullies because you can\u2019t read, and it\u2019s rude.", "Seriously, my first thought after reading the post was no wonder he doesn't have anywhere else to go for Thanksgivings...", "Am I the only one who thought nc meant his family is in North Carolina? God lord it\u2019s time for bed", "Asking the real questions here. \n\nHe sounds profoundly unpleasant. My money is on the latter.", "I get the idea the only person who he actually brings down is poor OP.\n\nIf he does insist on going, OP can always walk away from him every time he starts to whine. \n\nNo one is too old to train.  If she leaves his him to himself every time he invokes Debbie Downer, and she sticks to it, sooner or later, he will realize the only way he will have her buffer company at Thanksgiving is not to be a Bitter Betty.", "As someone who has a shitty family, it used to blow my mind people *voluntarily* spent time with family.  Like...why would you ever?\n\nThen I learned not all families were shitholes.", "I find it a strange concept as well. My family were cold, awkward and judgemental as hell growing up.", "Someone who deliberately acts like a grump almost in order to complain is generally unpleasant to be around. To me, this dude sounds *whiny* and that drives me nuts. \n\nTo act shocked when she said for him to not come with, then offended? GTFO of here, sir.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I don't think it's in too bad of form to bring food if you'll eat it. I don't see why OP could get her husband to see him bringing food as a potluck of sorts, so he's on board. But I'd hate to bring a wet blanket, it sours the spirit of the holidays.", "My ex  did the same freaking thing as your Dad. Ex was miserable and wanted to make me miserable and he did for 25 years.", "My dad used to decide to try to quit smoking whenever we went on vacation", "It drives my husband insane that I allow our daughter to eat whatever she wants. But it\u2019s because I never want her to know the hunger I felt while refusing to eat something.", "I really think people just didn\u2019t understand or know 30 years ago.  Heck maybe even 10 years ago.  They didn\u2019t understand or know about all of these sensory issues etc.  just thought the kid was being picky.  Hopefully as people start to understand this more, things like what you experienced won\u2019t happen.", "What's rude is comparing people who dislike certain foods to toddlers. What's rude is seeing a post about a person who complains about multiple things constantly and singling out the fact that he's a picky eater as his problem. What's rude is the way this subreddit treats people who don't like a wide variety of foods.\n\nThere was literally a post on here two days ago about a picky eater who tried to not make it an issue, and he got attacked and called an AH for not eating food he didn't like. It's exhausting how people don't see any problem with treating picky eating like a moral failure of some sort.\n\nLooking at OP's comments, the husband doesn't even complain to her family about the food, just to her. So it seems like he's got a very specific issue of not wanting to communicate or solve his problems. Him being a picky eater has nothing to do with him being an AH.", "Same here. It's like...either he's somehow the least shitty member of his family, which, *wow* I don't want to meet them if that's the case, or he's not being quite honest about who's no contact with whom.", "Aww I love you \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd79", "No contact\u2026 I thought it was a new gender identity.
