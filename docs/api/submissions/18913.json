A permanent punishment for this is excessive. He's 9 and doesn't understand the why of his sister's behavior. All he knows is that she's being mea he reacted. He reacted like a jerk to someone who was being a jerk. This could have been a teaching moment for him and your daughter. But instead, you chose to perpetuate a cycle of irrational reacting.  What was the lesson you wanted to teach him? YTA\n\nWoah... didn't expect my comment to vote\nBlow up like this. Thanks for the awards to those who gave them! \n\nEdit for grammar:\n\nI feel I need to clarify some stuff because, some seem to be reading into what I wrote what simply isn't there. \n\n1) I was referring to the perspective of a 9 year old. They do not have the sophistication of reasoning that adults do.  I am not saying that the sister WAS, in fact, a jerk. I'm saying that in his mind, she was... so he felt justified in doing what he did (teaching opportunity #1). 2) Yes, he threw his sister's menstrual cycle products away which is a shitty thing to do. But again, we're talking 9... to a young,  3rd grade mind, this was a funny, \"you pissed me off so I'm gonna piss you off\" behavior. Very unlikely that it's any more sophisticated than that (teaching opportunity #2. Don't mess with people's stuff just because you're mad). 3) jumping straight to the extreme punishment doesn't teach. It only shows sister doesn't get in trouble when she does something wrong and mom doesn't like him (from HIS perspective).  4) we have no evidence that OP addressed sister's being \"snippy.\" This is where I admit assumptions on my part,  but I feel it's a safe assumption that sister's actual words/behavior are being downplayed. Being \"snippy\" one time is understandable. But a 9 year old throwing her stuff away and then bragging to friends sounds much more like a final straw reaction than what is being implied. Especially considering how comfortable OP seems to be with the extreme punishment that was administered. (Teaching opportunity #3, you don't get to take your difficulties, whatever form they take, out on others)\n\nAt the end of the day, if you want a 9 year old boy to grow into an adult that respects women, it is PARAMOUNT to first help them UNDERSTAND women. Within the context of OP's post, the ball was dropped in this regard. If OP has had the discussion with her kids about what appropriate behavior is (on both their parts) when sister is experiencing her period, and taught them how they need to communicate with each other to minimize mutual antagonizing, and they STILL act this way toward each other... then it's appropriate to escalate the means of punishment. But to jump straight to this, wasn't.", "I feel like we need a bit more info;\n\nWhat your son did is bad and vengeful.  But he is 9. You are the parent. You didn't punish him, you did a tit for tat that is vengeful too. \n\nHave you talked to him about what is going on with his sister? Why she is acting the way she is? I dont mean the basic of menstruation, I mean about the pain, cramps and mood swings? Stuff that you know better?\n\nHis sister was snippy with him over a game he is playing. I get it, she is going through a lot. But again, didn't she have any alternative? Did she just request or ask him to lower the volume?\n\nI am not saying 9 year old is too young to understand. If you had done everything above and he still went ahead and did this, that is a very vengeful and mean attitude that needs correction. \n\nBut throwing away expensive switch doesn't seem to be the way. You could just hold it hostage to punish him.\n\nI think you never talked. Never taught him the actual issue. Just throwing it away is too over the board. \n\nThis is just going to make him more vengeful towards his sister and you rather than actually understanding what is wrong with the behaviour. I mean, you literally repeated his behaviour. This to him would mean this is an acceptable form of revenge.", "YTA. This is a disproportionate and unreasonable response to Mic. He was wrong in how he dealt with Mae but there is a significantly more mature way to communicate to Mic that he was wrong.", "YTA\n\nTeaching your children revenge (no matter how petty) is not a great example\n\nTake away the Switch, sure\n\nYou just copied his actions and reinforced exactly what he did, then grounded him", "YTA ... your son threw your daughter's belongings in the trash when he was angry, and you show him that's wrong by doing the same thing? You're an adult. What your son did was wrong, but you could have taught him that lesson by grounding him rather than having a sudden, scary, emotional reaction.\n\nedit: had the completely wrong word in there lol but y'all seemed to understand it anyway (behavior -> belongings)", "YTA and so is your son. Your husband sounds like the only sane person in the house right now. \n\nYour behavior was just as juvenile as your 9 year old's. He has an excuse: He's 9. What's yours? \n\nYes, there should be consequences for his actions. Putting the Switch away for a few weeks. Doing extra chores to make up for the time you had to spend going to get feminine hygiene products. Doing extra chores to earn the money to pay for replacement pads. \n\nWhat you've taught him is that it's OK to have a tantrum and ruin someone's things. He did it, you did it with something even more expensive. He won't learn from what you did, he'll just learn that bigger people get to have bigger tantrums. \n\nTime to think about what you want him to learn, not to react in rage to a stupid juvenile tantrum.", "YTA.  Throwing away a switch is stupid and wasteful. \n\nI might give you credit if you actually did give it away to someone as you mention, but you threw it in the trash in a fit of anger obviously.  Punishing in anger almost always makes YTA.  \n\nYour husband is right.", "YTA. What you should have done was what your husband did. Lock the switch in a safe that he cannot reach and ground him until he genuinely learns his lesson and apologize to his sister. What you did was immature parenting.\n\nSwitch is far more expensive that sanitary pads from what I understand. Yes, your son should not have it back for a while at least, but throwing it away felt like retaliating rather than teaching him a lesson. It was what I would think his 13 year old sister would have done not his adult mother. \n\nHis mother should have taught him to be more tolerant as his sister goes through this new stage in life AND taught his sister how to control raging hormones from causing tension with her brother", "YTA.\n\nYou made a decision to teach pettiness, vengeance,  and destruction rather than actually parent, teach, and understand the child.\n\nAre we sure this isn't the daughter posting as the mother?\n\nIf not, at least one of the parents sounds rational.", "Does your son understand what your daughters going through you had the talk about periods with him??  \nYour daughter snippy at him he acted like a 9year old and did a stupid uninformed thing.\nYOU did petty revenge on a 9 year old \n\nYour daughter going to be held accountable for her snippy or you giving her a pass because she has a period? So therefore reinforcing to your son it\u2019s ok you and her can have tantrums", "YTA. He acted like a child and deserves to be punished. You acted like a child too.", "YTA. That\u2019s overkill. A Switch costs hundreds of dollars and the games are expensive. I\u2019d have dragged his behind to the store and made him buy new ones. He wouldn\u2019t be laughing about that.", "YTA\n\nMic is 9 and still learning the difference about major/minor pranks in this area. Your husband has the right idea.", "YTA. you could\u2019ve grounded him and then sat him down to have a serious talk about the female body and why those products that he threw away were very important. also make him do extra chores to \u201cpay\u201d for the new products that you had to buy\n\nbtw, if your daughters periods are that bad, take her to a doctor. my mom didn\u2019t and i\u2019m dealing with the consequences in my 20s", "YTA.  Seriously, this is why being a teacher sucks nowadays.  Many of my students have parents like you, perpetuating deplorable behavior, and then wondering why their children act the way they do.  Take some parenting classes and get some therapy.", "YTA.  Your son shouldn\u2019t have thrown away his sister\u2019s hygiene products, and grounding him from his Switch seems like a reasonable consequence.  But you reacted in anger and retaliated by throwing away the Switch, an item that most likely won\u2019t be replaced.  \n\nAnd, by the way, mood swings and cramps are not reasons to treat people badly.  Reading between the lines, I\u2019m sensing some favoritism for your daughter and perhaps she\u2019s allowed to get away with behavior that wouldn\u2019t fly for your son.", "YTA, you're the parent learn how to de-escalate shit between your kids instead of acting like a kid yourself, jfc.", "YTA. He's a kid ffs. He did a stupid thing. You're an adult. You know better. No way pads are equivalent to a Switch. Come up with a more fair punishment. Like, make him pay for the pads he threw away, or do chores for them if he doesn't have any money. Take the Switch away for a day or two for the disrespect of laughing about it. Then move on. Don't make such a big deal about it. Pick your battles wisely. You've blown this one out of proportion.\n\nSource: parent of 4 kids, some of whom have used pads, and some of whom have had Switches, and all of whom have been stupid shits to one another from time to time.", "[deleted]", "ESH - your son is 9 and probably hasn\u2019t hit puberty yet.  Not giving him a pass, because he should know better than to throw stuff of value away.  OP should also know better than to throw away something in a fit of rage. \n\nOnly person here that did the right thing is the father. Kudos to him.", "A reasonable punishment for doing that is totally fine, but he's nine. It was a shitty thing for him to do and he absolutely needs to learn from it, but throwing away the switch is way over the top.\n\nTaking away the switch for a period of time would be much more reasonable then permanently getting rid of it. \n\nI get periods too, and yes that would be a hella inconvenient to have to run out to get more, and if that happened more then once I'd say getting rid of the switch is fine, but he's nine and from the information given this is his first time doing that.\n\nSo keep the switch locked up until you think he's learnt the lesson or whatever time you think is sufficient, but don't permanently take a nine year old kids major toy away because he was a little shit", "Wow\u2026. YTA for sure. I can\u2019t even wrap my head around this. Your son is brat, for doing what he did, but I guess a grown woman throwing a fit and a $300 game machine away as his role model I\u2019m not surprised. He should have had to pay for the replacements, when he went to the store, picked up the box with his own hands as mother yells, not those period pads, the ones next to the tampons. Now that\u2019s a lesson. And yes, that\u2019s exactly what I would have done.", "Not going to choose a judgment but please take your daughter to a gynecologist and list all of the issues she's experiencing if you haven't already. It sounds like this is more than your run of the mill menstrual experience. There are lots of possible things that could be going on such as PMDD and endometriosis.", "YTA, so to teach your son to not throw important things in the trash, you put important things in the trash?\n\n\nTeach your kids, punishment does nothing without them learning how to do better.", "YTA.\n\nIf this is even real, what you did was a massive over-reaction. Who throws away (or even gives away) something that costs hundreds of dollars as punishment for something far, far less?\n\nYour daughter is allowed to have \u201cmood swings\u201d (which entail what type of behavior, exactly?) but your son isn\u2019t?\n\nDo you frequently blame your daughter\u2019s periods for her bad behavior toward your son? \u2018Cause how does a 9 year old boy even know to go after his sister\u2019s feminine hygiene products? When I was 13, my 9 year old brother didn\u2019t even know what pads & tampons were. Or periods, which is why I don\u2019t think what he did was \u201ccruel\u201d. He doesn\u2019t understand.\n\nHave you thrown away your son\u2019s things before? It\u2019s just really weird that that\u2019s how he chose to respond to your \u201csnippy\u201d daughter, he got the idea from somewhere. \u2026Maybe he associates those items with his sister being mean to him, so in his mind, getting rid of them will stop her mood swings?    \nThrowing away a child\u2019s belongings is a REALLY SHITTY thing for a parent to do.  How can you be this upset over somebody throwing away something as easy to replace as feminine hygiene products and not realize that!?\n\nAnd it\u2019s just so over-the-top. This has to made up, right?", "yta - 9 year olds are assholes sometimes. parent him. throwing an expensive toy away is ridiculous. your husband seems to have a better grasp of things here", "YTA. Yes your son was being an asshole, but he is emotionally unequipped to deal with the mood swings of your 13 year old daughter. It\u2019s not his job to mediate these issues, it\u2019s yours. Should he be punished? Yes. Should you have retaliated by throwing something of his away? No. You\u2019re supposed to be the adult.", "You are obviously the asshole. Talk to your children. At least your husband seems to have a level head.", "YTA - your heart was in the right place but your reaction was over the top and blown out of proportion. Your husband is right.", "YTA\n\nWell, we see where Mic's overreaction stemmed from. He's a kid without a proper concept of exactly how much his sister needs her period products. Periods are an abstract concept to him. Did he deserve a punishment (and an explanation of why his behavior was wrong)? Yes. Did he deserve to never play his switch again because he, a 9-year-old, did something wrong? No.", "Want your kids to behave better?\n\nStart by setting the example. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Let\u2019s see, throw away $30 of FH products, throw away $300 console. Yup, that seems like a fair and reasonable response. Learn how to give a punishment that actually TEACHES your son what he did was wrong rather than reinforcing that throwing things away in anger is justifiable.", "YTA:  Jesus, can you make it more obvious who the favorite is?   Your daughter's having her period. That sucks.  But she's also taking it on her brother which isn't okay.   Stop this BS of normalizing bad behavior when a girl's on her period.  \n\n\nYour son is 9.  9 year olds are stupid and immature.  His big form of retribution was throwing out 5 dollars of pads.  That's not acceptable behavior.  It inconvenienced you, it caused her issues, but... it was one trip to the store.  The retribution here shouldn't be tossing out a 350 USD piece of technology nor should it be him losing it forever.  \n\n\nHonestly, how insane do you have to be to call your son 'cruel' over this mess?   Both siblings were being shitty to eachother, yet you feel the need to demonize your son and permanently destroy something he enjoys.  That's the only 'cruel' behavior here- yours.   You're being malicious and acting in the way to cause the most amount of discomfort and pain that you can.  \n\n\nYour husband should have done more than take the Switch out of the garbage.  He's the asshole too for not laying out how crazy your reactions are.", "Wtf.\nAre you the child or the parent?\n\nWhat a massive overreaction.\n\nYTA.\n\nTake away the switch. You don\u2019t throw away a $300 video game system (plus games cost) for $30 in pads.\n\nJFC", "[deleted]", "YTA. Teach your daughter how to treat people better. Having a period doesn't make it okay to be awful to people. Mic is 9 YEARS OLD and is tired of being snapped at, you clearly condone your daughter's behaviour and don't correct her when she \"gets snippy\". Awful parenting.", "YTA.\n\nThe punishment doesn\u2019t fit the offense. Your husband is correct; he should be grounded from the Switch and he needs to make a sincere apology to his sister for throwing away her stuff.\n\nAlso, if Mae\u2019s periods are that bad, she needs to see a gynecologist.", "ESH. Period mood swings and cramps do NOT excuse your daughters bad behavior, she needs to be made to at least apologise to her brother. And your son is 9, from his perspective his sister is being an ass so he threw away something minor to get back at her, makes him an ass too but pretty typical sibling reaction. Pads aren't nearly as expensive as a switch, and while he should lose the switch for a while and have to work off or pay back the cost of the pads he threw out, throwing out his switch was going way too far.\n\nYou are supposed to be the adult, and part of that is teaching your kids to work out their problems, not teach them to get even/revenge when someone does something they don't like. Right now, you are showing your daughter that she can get away with whatever she wants because she isn't feeling well, and you're showing your son that throwing things away in revenge is acceptable", "I just want to throw it out there my endo symptoms became horrible at 13. If her mood swings and pains are that bad make sure you are helping her keep track of symptoms.\n\nI do think an appropriate response should've been to simply remove video game/TV/online privileges altogether. Then make sure he apologizes and understands what he did and why it's bad. Throwing it away just shows that the behavior he did before is acceptable.", "ESH. On the one hand, he threw his sister's feminine hygiene products in the trash, and that isn't OK by any stretch of the imagination. However, taking his switch away from him and throwing it in the garbage would not have been an effective punishment, and neither would permanently taking it away, especially not for a nine year old. If my parents did anything like that to me, I wouldn't have forgiven them for it, no matter what the context behind it was.", "Question why didn't you just get them out of the trash? Or was the trash like had liquid stuff on it and btw YTA", "YTA. A switch and feminine products are not nearly on the same level. One is easily replaceable and maybe $30 at most depending on how big of a pack you buy, the other is hundreds of dollars. Plus while it definitely is not fun to have to do so your daughter is able to use toilet paper in place of a pad for a little while until the replacements came, I say this as a person who has had to use toilet paper for that purpose many times. It sucks but it works. Maybe instead of throwing out your sons belongings as a punishment you should actually try to educate him about periods and teach him to be more considerate to his sister when she\u2019s on them. Sure take the switch away and ground him as a start to that lesson but throwing away his switch is not nearly the same as him throwing away some pads.", "ESH.", "ESH", "Yeah go ahead and carry on if you want him to hate you as he grows up", "YTA - you are really parenting at the level of a 9 year old child and think that\u2019s appropriate?", "ESH you threw a switch in the trash?? Even if you meant to get rid permanently like donate it? Sell it? That is ludicrously wasteful. \n\nYour husband shouldn't have outright undermined you though while the kid was still there, *especially* given the context. \n\nAlso has anyone actually spoken to the kid about **why** what he did was so wrong?? Agreed with punishing him but that shouldnt be the end of it.", "YTA\n\nBut I find it really to rationalise why a 9 year old threw away his sister's feminine hygiene products.  Doing that  while on her period seems quite calculated and extra nasty.  I would think the way a kid would think is to throw away something she really likes as punishment for her behaviour... not her pads.  That's weird in itself.\n\nDo you have a history of over reacting over things like this?  You gave him a good negative reaction.  It will become a competition soon... how can I make mom really react in the worst ways and you will become a joke.\n\nHow long has your daughter had her periods.  Just started, or have they been occurring for quite a while now?  If it's been a while then take her to a gynae.  There is help with this.  Irrational mood swings that are well over normal actually have a name and a treatment.  Heavy painful periods can lead to anemia and there is help with that too.\n\nPerhaps have a look at getting help for your anger management if this is a common occurrence.  It's possible that you are also bringing up a brat of a child finding some strategies to help might make all the difference to your family harmony.  He's 9 and young.. there is hope.  There'll be less hope if he's 16 and still behaving like this.", "YTA \n\nLet\u2019s talk about proportionate response. It\u2019s the opposite of what you just did.", "What your son did isn\u2019t great but seems doesn\u2019t seem out there enough to warrant giving away a $300+ item. His sister lashed out at him and he got back at her by throwing away disposable items that she needed. You got back at your son FOR your daughter by possibly breaking his non-disposable expensive item\u2026 YTA. \n\nGently OP, I think you may be more offended by this because you\u2019re also a girl (you have a husband and kids so I\u2019m assuming this, no offense meant). You\u2019re son should most definitely be grounded and punished to some extent, but permanently breaking something of his over something pretty easily replaceable seems harsh. Why not just have your son pay for however many pads he threw away?", "YTA. Bad parenting. You should have taken the switch away for a few weeks then spoken to your son. If he gets an allowance, you could also make him replace the product he threw away.", "YTA. Next time; take him with you on that emergency shopping.

I wish OP was more specific on how bad the cramps are, because for many women and girls it\u2019s not really simple pain from cramps. It truly can be excruciating, and that can because underlying conditions such as endometriosis or pcos which is shockingly common and heavily mistreated and undiagnosed. When I had to deal with this- I had often been unable to move due to the pain, and have contemplated more extreme options to stop the pain. \n\nWhile I have always done my best during these times to be nice, my best solution was to avoid people as much as possible because it is incredibly hard to deal with unbearable pain while being kind.

Even if they aren\u2019t severe and just simply bad, I wonder how OP has helped the daughter learn how to manage these symptoms. I personally just can\u2019t put much judgement on the daughter without knowing how bad her symptoms are and what her parents have done to manage them- even the lighter end of cramp pain can still be hard to manage especially mentally. If they aren\u2019t so severe but still not easily manageable, has OP taught her daughter how to set her own boundaries with herself and others when dealing with her mood swings and cramps? It\u2019s hard to just not be snippy when in constant pain, but is the daughter allowed/taught to take space to herself when she is dealing with this? \n\nI don\u2019t think we can compare someone getting a little snippy, as everyone has attitudes every once in a while (but still should be held accountable regardless of the type of pain), to someone throwing away someone else\u2019s medical devices. At 9, he should know better, but I am going to put blame on OP and her husband for this- because it\u2019s entirely the parents fault for their 9 year old to not know better. I personally just find it hard to give judgement on how someone reacts on their pain without knowing the severity or steps taken to manage or educate someone- especially when periods are still very new for the age of 13. She should be held accountable for her attitude, I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s completely justified or anything- but they have already neglected to teach their one child to not tamper or trash other people\u2019s medical devices, how have they neglected their daughters care? \n\nAlso, I genuinely do not care if anyone wishes to reply with how they still managed to be a polite angel with their cramps- not everyone tolerates pain the same way, periods are not cookie cutter experiences, and there is not enough context to truly judge how much of TA the daughter is especially when how regularly downplayed severe cramps can be.

I was only ever given stronger and stronger painkillers by my doctors and treated like I was a hypochondriac when i'd complain of the pain. I used to miss school, I flunked out of my first year at university because of the pain.

I would also make sure your daughter is getting the right vitamins - evening primrose. B6 etc - it really helps. Good luck", "YTA. Your son definitely sucks in this situation, but not only is he 9, and therefore still very, very, very much a child and not properly aware of... most anything, really...\n\nBut taking expensive things and throwing them away as punishment is honestly somewhat pathetic. It'd be different if, say, your son was a teenager, had a car that you and your husband bought him, then decided to mow down all the bins on your street, or tried to ram the house when he was pissed off. At that point, yeah, *crack on*, sell the car, give it away, do whatever you want, because what you're doing there is a direct punishment, removing the thing with which he actually perpetrated his offence.\n\nBut 'you threw away her stuff, so I'll throw away your stuff' is just *bad* punishing. \n\n>what our son did was cruel and he should be punished for it \n\nYou're sort of right here. What your son did is cruel (though, again, you ahould question how much he understands the severity of what he did), and he should be punished, *so he learns not to do the thing again*. So this would include a conversation about *why* what he did was so terrible (compare it to if there were no toilets in the house, and he had constant diarrhoea), lessons in alternative ways to express his frustration with his sister (I'm guessing there was more going on that you're not telling us, or than you realise than just her 'being a bit snippy about him being too loud'), and a punishment for his infraction. But the punishment is there to drive home the lesson, not to get retribution for your daughter.\n\n> and a loss of his switch is punishment.\n\nAnd for a 9-year-old, his switch being locked up in a safe for an extended period of time is the same thing as loss. \n\nEven if you view it as tit-for-tat, the punishment you attempted is not proportionate. Sanitary pads, while definitely an urgent and immediate need, are not irreplaceable. In fact, they're a *consumable item*. He didn't take a valuable family heirloom and flush it down the toilet, or give away her laptop to a hobo. So effectively destroying an expensive, non-replaceable possession is wildly disproportionate to begin with.\n\nHonestly, your reasoning kind of reminds me of *my* mother. And that's not a good comparison for you. This is the woman who, when I was 18 and in an abusive relationship came into my room and found me crying, but reluctant to explain why, thought that the best way to get me to open up was to threaten to have me sectioned under the mental health act (arrested under a 24-hour psychiatrical, in US parlance), and threaten to kick me out of the house. Then she called my dad, and continued yelling. So I had my abusive girlfriend on Skype, my dad on the phone trying to calm me down, and my mother continuing to scream the aforementioned threats.\n\nYeah, YTA. Don't be my mother. Follow your husband's lead on this. I'd say a month or two is sufficient punishment. And you need to sit your son down and have the aforementioned conversations.

Nobody ever told me that I just hopped on Yasmin birth control without my mom knowing at 15 and then all those studies came out about the effects of using yas and Yasmin long term and I just switched brands at 20\u2026 health education for young people is severely lacking", "Yes. I ended up diagnosed with endometriosis", "> I have a hard time with everybody saying the 9yo was just ignorant.\n> \n> Choosing those exact products to dump, and later boasting to his (online) friends about it, shows he knew exactly what the effect of his action was. Nothing ignorent about it.\n\nA person can know what a period is and what tampons/pads are, and still not really understand *what it means*. I would file a lot of guys, and a few women, in that category. Look at how many women in this thread are chiming in with stories of their own mothers not believing them with how bad their periods were.", "Yes, thank you. You have put it in words better than I could.", "My mother used to say \"You're never going to have a baby!!\" because I couldn't handle simple monthly cramps\ud83d\ude33 come to find out, she never had cramps AND when she gave birth to her 3 children she was KNOCKED COMPLETELY OUT!  I had 3 babies via c-sections after 20+ hours of labor each....", "Sorry you had to go through that. I fainted at school in math class due to ungodly cramps it was quite embarrassing although a guy sitting next to me caught me before my head could smash the desk", "Your mom is awesome.\n\nI have raised my boy the same.  When he was 9 years old a tampon fell out of a woman's purse he picked up it up and said you dropped your tampon.  She was mortified.  Looks at me and says he should not know what this is.  I asked her why? She said he was a boy and way too young.  I am like he is boy that will have to around women his whole life, I don't want to grow up and have the same terror of buying tampons for his spouse as he will having to purchase the hemorrhoid cream you have in your hand.  I mean I was a wee bit cruel but honestly.  It is a tampon.", "Agreed. OP is the AH.", "The only lesson this series of events *could* teach him is that the women in his life are willing to abuse and gang up on him for no reason (no reason he could possibly understand without an explanation, that is).\n\nSon needs to understand what is going on AND learn better ways to deal with his problems (Which, quite frankly, given OPs absolutely insane overreaction, I get why he doesn't feel like he has any outside support to help resolve his problems, it smells a lot like his problematic behavior is at least partially down to OPs unfair favoritism, what the hell is a 9 year old supposed to do when at least one of their parents is making it clear that she doesn't have his back when he's being mistreated?), but daughter needs to understand that being on her period is not an excuse to be an asshole either, and OP needs to, frankly, get her shit together.\n\nYTA, to an incredible degree. This is how you raise a misogynist.", "This. YTA.", "The lesson was that she\u2019s a female and needs to be treated \u201cspecial\u201d when she\u2019s on her period. Total bullshit.", "Can't imagine where he got the impression that acting like a jerk and over reacting was a totally reasonable response...\n\nOP YTA and emotionally immature", "Piggybacking on the top comment because I have nothing to add on that, but I hope you told your daughter off for getting snippy with your son initially.

It's a period, not cancer. If he doesn't understand what a period is and how it can effect a person than that's because of his parents and teachers neglecting to educate him, not because he is young. 9 is well in the normal range of starting periods so if all the kids who are starting their periods can understand so can everyone else", "> What was the lesson you wanted to teach him\n\nStuff like this is why so many boys grow up thinking women are just angry and irrational while on their periods.", "Yes.  Exactly.\n\nOP feels what her son did is cruel, but that's because she's a grown woman.  She understands not just PMS, but also the importance of hygiene products like pads.\n\nMic is 9, not 19.  Even if he has been told about girls and periods, there's no way he grasps the necessity of pads.  To him, he threw away something his sister, who is currently being moody and snippy with him, uses.  He thinks they're something she likes.\n\nThe level of cruelty of an act depends on the understanding of the act.", "THIS you totally lost perspective op YTA", "not only wasteful and stupid, it is hurtful. children have little belongings and i suspect the switch is one of their most important possessions in their life.", "She also just completely undermined her own credibility as a parent by overreacting and forcing her husband to take the Switch back out of the rubbish bin. Her son is going to come out of this with less respect for the punishment, not more.\n\nWhen I was a kid I had a stupid argument with my dad and he threw out our tv. When my mum came home she immediately had to bring it back inside because 1) it was a major overreaction and 2) she ALSO watched that tv - one parent can\u2019t unilaterally decide a family punishment of that magnitude.\n\nAs a parent you should never bluff with a consequence that you aren\u2019t in a position to follow through on, and I don\u2019t think permanently throwing out hundreds of dollars worth of electronics is a decision that can be made by a single parent in a moment of anger. You and your husband need to discuss these things as a team.", "Being 9 years old is no excuse to throw away things people need", "This is what has been sticking out to me, as well. People are defending the son because he\u2019s a child, but his sister is 13 *and also a child*. She\u2019s learning to manage massive changes in her body, and we know that menstrual hormones impact the brain. \n\nI can\u2019t help but feel that misogyny is at play when people are expecting a child to have the maturity, control and resilience of an adult.", "Alot of people are saying in his defense for throwing away his sister's things and humiliating her that he's 9", "It might have been because of my autistic brain\u2019s ability to analyse myself and my behavioural patterns, but I had at pretty good grasp of when I was being hormonal as a teen and would inform my family not to speak to me, because I would snap at them. Always respected that. Offered the same service to my boyfriends down the line too. They appreciated the heads up ;P", "I think it's very telling that OP glossed over what her daughter did to start the issue and focused on her son's retaliation.\n\nYes, there no info and I think that's because OP knows if she shared it, it would balance the judgement.\n\nBut...since OP didn't tell us, that's all guesswork.", "Alright, as a cis-woman here, I agree what the boy did was wrong, BUT I highly doubt he would\u2019ve had an extreme reaction if she just nicely asked him to turn down his game. He should be punished, but not in such an extreme manner.", "I really like this. Reflection is what will prevent that behavior going forward, not the punishment (at least not for the right reasons).", "So does his sister.", "OP also said her mood swings are severe, so I doubt this was the only instance that led to that evaluation.", "That means that they are worse parents. That means they had time to think about it, and still decided to damage their child.", "The depo shot is my best friend, I recommend it to everybody.", "Yeah lol, my mom didn't want us to turn out like her brother or our dad. Her brother was barely younger than her but was constantly grossed out at the very mention of periods and her parents didn't really do anything about it, and my dad, despite having sisters himself, legit thought my mom was dying when he saw blood in the toilet after she had used it. She didn't want us to be that freaked out by something that happens every month.", "Well, atleast we know who op's favorite is. Imagine how horrible it would be if op's husband wasn't in the picture.", "ESH (except husband and daughter), throwing away $300 is not a good way to punish your son.", "Isn\u2019t there an age restriction for Fortnite?  He\u2019s far too young to be playing that.  No wonder he\u2019s behaving the way he is. I\u2019d be throwing his Switch in the trash too. And get help for your daughter.", "ESH it\u2019s an overreaction, but your husband is under reacting. He doesn\u2019t seem to care why this is important, and it\u2019s all a symbol of how your son might treat women/AFAB folks/feminine presenting folks throughout their life. Talks should be had with all.", "I mean eh either way the kid would\u2019ve learned a lesson. I don\u2019t think OP is TERRIBLE. I mean what he did is messed up. But yes could\u2019ve been dealt with differently too.", "Yta 9yo too young for online gaming. Seriously have you ever actually listened to chats? You're on reddit you should know better.", "I love this clearsighted view of the situation\u2764\ufe0f as a parent to a daughter with a period and a 10 yr old boy. I agree with this totally. \n\nThe OP\u2019s reaction is what makes kids feel like their feelings don\u2019t matter and that they aren\u2019t \u2018seen\u2019 and that things would be easier if either they or the other person just wasn\u2019t there. Meaning they will never see their sibling as an ally or friend which is just so sad. Smacks of playing favourites. \n\nSo to the OP yes, YTA.", "Spot on. \n\nEven if it isn\u2019t favouritism, at the very least OP took personal offence to her sons actions due to her also being someone who has periods. \n\nHer personal bias 100% got in the way.", "A Switch is a luxury/ privilege- pads for a menstruating girl or woman are a NEED. the son tossed them out and the parents have not done a good job of explaining to him what his sister is going through and what she needs. He is never going to have to go through period pain, cramps, mood swings, and bleeding, and if OP hadn\u2019t rushed to get her daughter pads, it\u2019s very possible the daughter could have gotten some kind of infection or illness from not changing her pad, esp if she\u2019s having heavy bleeding.", "I mean, given how easily OP decided to throw away a device that costs hundreds of euros/dollars, it probably isn't the first time OP has taught her kids that throwing away someone's property after they upset you is a valid way of reacting.", "No, daughter should get a scold.  \nShe started the whole thing.   \nYes, you can give allowances, but...it really feels like she's been given too much slack.", "And on top of that, he was bragging about it to his friends. He knew exactly what he was doing by throwing it away. I swear this place has infinite and undeserved sympathy for little boys, there's always some garbage excuse for their misbehaviour.", "OP didn't say bragging.\n\nThat's your projection.", "Similar-ish story here too. Switched briefly to a different birth control pill in my mid 20s, and those were the *worst* mood swings I've ever had in my life. I really did feel out of control - there were times I was fully aware I was being raving bitch but it was practically an out-of-body experience. There was just no stopping it. It was 6 months of hell before my doc finally approved a different med.", "OP said laughing, not bragging.\n\nThey are different things.", "Sure he is 9, but this could be the beginning of very dangerous behavior. This is something that needs to be corrected immediately before he gets older.", "I don't think a 13 year old snapping at a younger sibling for being loud is being unreasonable.", "Yea throwing them away showed ignorance but bragging about it showed he was proud of it", "Yes, because she did that to him.\n\nKids laughing with their friends over things they did to their siblings is normal.\n\nOP is seeing red and massively overreacting. She needs to calm down a little and look at the situation a little more objectively.\n\nDo you think the sister has never laughed with her friends over something she did to her brother?", "EXACTLY! Being 9 shouldn't be an excuse to behave like this. Like yeah the 13 year old was being a little mean but that shouldn't be an excuse to let him throw away her needs but alot of them are still gonna excuse his behavior because He's 9", "Mind you, OP is very pro-daughter, so it's worth questioning whether she really was only snippy or if she was acting a bit more hostile.", "Siblings often do what they can to antagonize one another, it's just part of the experience my wife tells me. But returning to the same activities and bragging about his actions show that he isn't feeling terribly bullied as were he he would more respond with denial, and defense. Nor would he feel comfortable returning to the same activities without worry of reprisal.", "The people saying the 13 year was being horrible are wild. She is 13, in tremendous pain, and her brother was being loud and annoying her. A young teenager snipping at a sibling one time when they are sick is such a non-issue.", "My mom would just say \"I have the same problem, you just suck it up, take some Tylenol and deal with it!\" What's next?  \"Just shove a dinosaur egg up there like we did back in the day?\" That's pretty archaic, mom!  \n\nOf course, I'm in my 40s so...the 90s were a different time.", "When my mom took me to the doctor for period problems when I was 13, his recommendation was I be put on BCP's. He literally told her \"Now Mom, just because she's on birth control pills, that doesn't mean she's going to run out and start having sex\". Even though we were Southern Baptists, she had zero issues and agreed. Still so grateful for that.", "Yeah I know the only reasonable people in this post are the 13 year old and the husband the other 2 are complete assholes", "Usually male doctors. They\u2019re notorious for underplaying pain when women report it. I shattered my shoulder and was told to go home and take Tylenol and wait for the call that the surgery had been scheduled. I\u2019m 67 now and most of my life doctors have been reluctant to give me strong pain meds."]}
