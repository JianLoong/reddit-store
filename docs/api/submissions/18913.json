A permanent punishment for this is excessive. He's 9 and doesn't understand the why of his sister's behavior. All he knows is that she's being mean to him and he reacted. He reacted like a jerk to someone who was being a jerk. This could have been a teaching moment for him and your daughter. But instead, you chose to perpetuate a cycle of irrational reacting.  What was the lesson you wanted to teach him? YTA", "I feel like we need a bit more info;\n\nWhat your son did is bad and vengeful.  But he is 9. You are the parent. You didn't punish him, you did a tit for tat that is vengeful too. \n\nHave you talked to him about what is going on with his sister? Why she is acting the way she is? I dont mean the basic of menstruation, I mean about the pain, cramps and mood swings? Stuff that you know better?\n\nHis sister was snippy with him over a game he is playing. I get it, she is going through a lot. But again, didn't she have any alternative? Did she just request or ask him to lower the volume?\n\nI am not saying 9 year old is too young to understand. If you had done everything above and he still went ahead and did this, that is a very vengeful and mean attitude that needs correction. \n\nBut throwing away expensive switch doesn't seem to be the way. You could just hold it hostage to punish him.\n\nI think you never talked. Never taught him the actual issue. Just throwing it away is too over the board. \n\nThis is just going to make him more vengeful towards his sister and you rather than actually understanding what is wrong with the behaviour. I mean, you literally repeated his behaviour. This to him would mean this is an acceptable form of revenge.", "YTA. This is a disproportionate and unreasonable response to Mic. He was wrong in how he dealt with Mae but there is a significantly more mature way to communicate to Mic that he was wrong.", "YTA\n\nTeaching your children revenge (no matter how petty) is not a great example\n\nTake away the Switch, sure\n\nYou just copied his actions and reinforced exactly what he did, then grounded him", "YTA ... your son threw your daughter's behavior in the trash when he was angry, and you show him that's wrong by doing the same thing? You're an adult. What your son did was wrong, but you could have taught him that lesson by grounding him rather than having a sudden, scary, emotional reaction.", "YTA and so is your son. Your husband sounds like the only sane person in the house right now. \n\nYour behavior was just as juvenile as your 9 year old's. He has an excuse: He's 9. What's yours? \n\nYes, there should be consequences for his actions. Putting the Switch away for a few weeks. Doing extra chores to make up for the time you had to spend going to get feminine hygiene products. Doing extra chores to earn the money to pay for replacement pads. \n\nWhat you've taught him is that it's OK to have a tantrum and ruin someone's things. He did it, you did it with something even more expensive. He won't learn from what you did, he'll just learn that bigger people get to have bigger tantrums. \n\nTime to think about what you want him to learn, not to react in rage to a stupid juvenile tantrum.", "YTA.  Throwing away a switch is stupid and wasteful. \n\nI might give you credit if you actually did give it away to someone as you mention, but you threw it in the trash in a fit of anger obviously.  Punishing in anger almost always makes YTA.  \n\nYour husband is right.", "YTA. What you should have done was what your husband did. Lock the switch in a safe that he cannot reach and ground him until he genuinely learns his lesson and apologize to his sister. What you did was immature parenting.\n\nSwitch is far more expensive that sanitary pads from what I understand. Yes, your son should not have it back for a while at least, but throwing it away felt like retaliating rather than teaching him a lesson. It was what I would think his 13 year old sister would have done not his adult mother. \n\nHis mother should have taught him to be more tolerant as his sister goes through this new stage in life AND taught his sister how to control raging hormones from causing tension with her brother", "YTA.\n\nYou made a decision to teach pettiness, vengeance,  and destruction rather than actually parent, teach, and understand the child.\n\nAre we sure this isn't the daughter posting as the mother?\n\nIf not, at least one of the parents sounds rational.", "Does your son understand what your daughters going through you had the talk about periods with him??  \nYour daughter snippy at him he acted like a 9year old and did a stupid uninformed thing.\nYOU did petty revenge on a 9 year old \n\nYour daughter going to be held accountable for her snippy or you giving her a pass because she has a period? So therefore reinforcing to your son it\u2019s ok you and her can have tantrums", "YTA. He acted like a child and deserves to be punished. You acted like a child too.", "YTA. That\u2019s overkill.

Take some parenting classes and get some therapy.", "YTA.  Your son shouldn\u2019t have thrown away his sister\u2019s hygiene products, and grounding him from his Switch seems like a reasonable consequence.  But you reacted in anger and retaliated by throwing away the Switch, an item that most likely won\u2019t be replaced.  \n\nAnd, by the way, mood swings and cramps are not reasons to treat people badly.  Reading between the lines, I\u2019m sensing some favoritism for your daughter and perhaps she\u2019s allowed to get away with behavior that wouldn\u2019t fly for your son.", "YTA, you're the parent learn how to de-escalate shit between your kids instead of acting like a kid yourself, jfc.", "YTA. He's a kid ffs. He did a stupid thing. You're an adult. You know better. No way pads are equivalent to a Switch. Come up with a more fair punishment. Like, make him pay for the pads he threw away, or do chores for them if he doesn't have any money. Take the Switch away for a day or two for the disrespect of laughing about it. Then move on. Don't make such a big deal about it. Pick your battles wisely. You've blown this one out of proportion.\n\nSource: parent of 4 kids, some of whom have used pads, and some of whom have had Switches, and all of whom have been stupid shits to one another from time to time.", "ESH. Periods don\u2019t excuse irrational, mean behavior. Getting bullied does not excuse revenge, bully behavior. Being called parent, does not excuse throwing away someone else\u2019s (your sons) possessions. \n\nThe grounding would make sense, but throwing away an expensive device over pads isn\u2019t worth it. \n\nThe only rational one here is your husband.", "ESH - your son is 9 and probably hasn\u2019t hit puberty yet.  Not giving him a pass, because he should know better than to throw stuff of value away.  OP should also know better than to throw away something in a fit of rage. \n\nOnly person here that did the right thing is the father. Kudos to him.", "A reasonable punishment for doing that is totally fine, but he's nine. It was a shitty thing for him to do and he absolutely needs to learn from it, but throwing away the switch is way over the top.\n\nTaking away the switch for a period of time would be much more reasonable then permanently getting rid of it. \n\nI get periods too, and yes that would be a hella inconvenient to have to run out to get more, and if that happened more then once I'd say getting rid of the switch is fine, but he's nine and from the information given this is his first time doing that.\n\nSo keep the switch locked up until you think he's learnt the lesson or whatever time you think is sufficient, but don't permanently take a nine year old kids major toy away because he was a little shit", "Wow\u2026. YTA for sure. I can\u2019t even wrap my head around this. Your son is brat, for doing what he did, but I guess a grown woman throwing a fit and a $300 game machine away as his role model I\u2019m not surprised. He should have had to pay for the replacements, when he went to the store, picked up the box with his own hands as mother yells, not those period pads, the ones next to the tampons. Now that\u2019s a lesson. And yes, that\u2019s exactly what I would have done.", "Not going to choose a judgment but please take your daughter to a gynecologist and list all of the issues she's experiencing if you haven't already. It sounds like this is more than your run of the mill menstrual experience. There are lots of possible things that could be going on such as PMDD and endometriosis.", "YTA, so to teach your son to not throw important things in the trash, you put important things in the trash?\n\n\nTeach your kids, punishment does nothing without them learning how to do better.", "YTA.\n\nIf this is even real, what you did was a massive over-reaction. Who throws away (or even gives away) something that costs hundreds of dollars as punishment for something far, far less?\n\nYour daughter is allowed to have \u201cmood swings\u201d (which entail what type of behavior, exactly?) but your son isn\u2019t?\n\nDo you frequently blame your daughter\u2019s periods for her bad behavior toward your son? \u2018Cause how does a 9 year old boy even know to go after his sister\u2019s feminine hygiene products? When I was 13, my 9 year old brother didn\u2019t even know what pads & tampons were. Or periods, which is why I don\u2019t think what he did was \u201ccruel\u201d. He doesn\u2019t understand.\n\nHave you thrown away your son\u2019s things before? It\u2019s just really weird that that\u2019s how he chose to respond to your \u201csnippy\u201d daughter, he got the idea from somewhere. \u2026Maybe he associates those items with his sister being mean to him, so in his mind, getting rid of them will stop her mood swings?    \nThrowing away a child\u2019s belongings is a REALLY SHITTY thing for a parent to do.  How can you be this upset over somebody throwing away something as easy to replace as feminine hygiene products and not realize that!?\n\nAnd it\u2019s just so over-the-top. This has to made up, right?", "yta - 9 year olds are assholes sometimes. parent him. throwing an expensive toy away is ridiculous. your husband seems to have a better grasp of things here", "YTA. Yes your son was being an asshole, but he is emotionally unequipped to deal with the mood swings of your 13 year old daughter. It\u2019s not his job to mediate these issues, it\u2019s yours. Should he be punished? Yes. Should you have retaliated by throwing something of his away? No. You\u2019re supposed to be the adult.", "You are obviously the asshole. Talk to your children. At least your husband seems to have a level head.", "YTA - your heart was in the right place but your reaction was over the top and blown out of proportion. Your husband is right.", "YTA\n\nWell, we see where Mic's overreaction stemmed from. He's a kid without a proper concept of exactly how much his sister needs her period products. Periods are an abstract concept to him. Did he deserve a punishment (and an explanation of why his behavior was wrong)? Yes. Did he deserve to never play his switch again because he, a 9-year-old, did something wrong? No.", "Want your kids to behave better?\n\nStart by setting the example. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Let\u2019s see, throw away $30 of FH products, throw away $300 console. Yup, that seems like a fair and reasonable response. Learn how to give a punishment that actually TEACHES your son what he did was wrong rather than reinforcing that throwing things away in anger is justifiable.", "YTA:  Jesus, can you make it more obvious who the favorite is?   Your daughter's having her period. That sucks.  But she's also taking it on her brother which isn't okay.   Stop this BS of normalizing bad behavior when a girl's on her period.  \n\n\nYour son is 9.  9 year olds are stupid and immature.  His big form of retribution was throwing out 5 dollars of pads.  That's not acceptable behavior.  It inconvenienced you, it caused her issues, but... it was one trip to the store.  The retribution here shouldn't be tossing out a 350 USD piece of technology nor should it be him losing it forever.  \n\n\nHonestly, how insane do you have to be to call your son 'cruel' over this mess?   Both siblings were being shitty to eachother, yet you feel the need to demonize your son and permanently destroy something he enjoys.  That's the only 'cruel' behavior here- yours.   You're being malicious and acting in the way to cause the most amount of discomfort and pain that you can.  \n\n\nYour husband should have done more than take the Switch out of the garbage.  He's the asshole too for not laying out how crazy your reactions are.", "Wtf.\nAre you the child or the parent?\n\nWhat a massive overreaction.\n\nYTA.\n\nTake away the switch. You don\u2019t throw away a $300 video game system (plus games cost) for $30 in pads.\n\nJFC", "You are correct to immediately nip that behavior in the bud. Too many women are expected to hide our discomfort, and I\u2019m glad you have your daughter\u2019s back. However, throwing a little boy\u2019s toy in the trash was over the top. He didn\u2019t destroy her electronics. It was a teachable moment, and you blew it. YTA, but good for you for having your daughter\u2019s back when it comes to her period. It can be absolutely awful for some women, and men need to be taught right away to respect that.", "YTA. Teach your daughter how to treat people better. Having a period doesn't make it okay to be awful to people. Mic is 9 YEARS OLD and is tired of being snapped at, you clearly condone your daughter's behaviour and don't correct her when she \"gets snippy\". Awful parenting.", "YTA.\n\nThe punishment doesn\u2019t fit the offense. Your husband is correct; he should be grounded from the Switch and he needs to make a sincere apology to his sister for throwing away her stuff.\n\nAlso, if Mae\u2019s periods are that bad, she needs to see a gynecologist.", "ESH. Period mood swings and cramps do NOT excuse your daughters bad behavior, she needs to be made to at least apologise to her brother. And your son is 9, from his perspective his sister is being an ass so he threw away something minor to get back at her, makes him an ass too but pretty typical sibling reaction. Pads aren't nearly as expensive as a switch, and while he should lose the switch for a while and have to work off or pay back the cost of the pads he threw out, throwing out his switch was going way too far.\n\nYou are supposed to be the adult, and part of that is teaching your kids to work out their problems, not teach them to get even/revenge when someone does something they don't like. Right now, you are showing your daughter that she can get away with whatever she wants because she isn't feeling well, and you're showing your son that throwing things away in revenge is acceptable", "I just want to throw it out there my endo symptoms became horrible at 13. If her mood swings and pains are that bad make sure you are helping her keep track of symptoms.\n\nI do think an appropriate response should've been to simply remove video game/TV/online privileges altogether. Then make sure he apologizes and understands what he did and why it's bad. Throwing it away just shows that the behavior he did before is acceptable.", "ESH. On the one hand, he threw his sister's feminine hygiene products in the trash, and that isn't OK by any stretch of the imagination. However, taking his switch away from him and throwing it in the garbage would not have been an effective punishment, and neither would permanently taking it away, especially not for a nine year old. If my parents did anything like that to me, I wouldn't have forgiven them for it, no matter what the context behind it was.", "Question why didn't you just get them out of the trash? Or was the trash like had liquid stuff on it and btw YTA", "YTA. A switch and feminine products are not nearly on the same level. One is easily replaceable and maybe $30 at most depending on how big of a pack you buy, the other is hundreds of dollars. Plus while it definitely is not fun to have to do so your daughter is able to use toilet paper in place of a pad for a little while until the replacements came, I say this as a person who has had to use toilet paper for that purpose many times. It sucks but it works. Maybe instead of throwing out your sons belongings as a punishment you should actually try to educate him about periods and teach him to be more considerate to his sister when she\u2019s on them. Sure take the switch away and ground him as a start to that lesson but throwing away his switch is not nearly the same as him throwing away some pads.", "ESH.", "ESH", "Yeah go ahead and carry on if you want him to hate you as he grows up", "YTA - you are really parenting at the level of a 9 year old child and think that\u2019s appropriate?", "ESH you threw a switch in the trash?? Even if you meant to get rid permanently like donate it? Sell it? That is ludicrously wasteful. \n\nYour husband shouldn't have outright undermined you though while the kid was still there, *especially* given the context. \n\nAlso has anyone actually spoken to the kid about **why** what he did was so wrong?? Agreed with punishing him but that shouldnt be the end of it.", "YTA\n\nBut I find it really to rationalise why a 9 year old threw away his sister's feminine hygiene products.  Doing that  while on her period seems quite calculated and extra nasty.  I would think the way a kid would think is to throw away something she really likes as punishment for her behaviour... not her pads.  That's weird in itself.\n\nDo you have a history of over reacting over things like this?  You gave him a good negative reaction.  It will become a competition soon... how can I make mom really react in the worst ways and you will become a joke.\n\nHow long has your daughter had her periods.  Just started, or have they been occurring for quite a while now?  If it's been a while then take her to a gynae.  There is help with this.  Irrational mood swings that are well over normal actually have a name and a treatment.  Heavy painful periods can lead to anemia and there is help with that too.\n\nPerhaps have a look at getting help for your anger management if this is a common occurrence.  It's possible that you are also bringing up a brat of a child finding some strategies to help might make all the difference to your family harmony.  He's 9 and young.. there is hope.  There'll be less hope if he's 16 and still behaving like this.", "YTA \n\nLet\u2019s talk about proportionate response. It\u2019s the opposite of what you just did.", "What your son did isn\u2019t great but seems doesn\u2019t seem out there enough to warrant giving away a $300+ item. His sister lashed out at him and he got back at her by throwing away disposable items that she needed. You got back at your son FOR your daughter by possibly breaking his non-disposable expensive item\u2026 YTA. \n\nGently OP, I think you may be more offended by this because you\u2019re also a girl (you have a husband and kids so I\u2019m assuming this, no offense meant). You\u2019re son should most definitely be grounded and punished to some extent, but permanently breaking something of his over something pretty easily replaceable seems harsh. Why not just have your son pay for however many pads he threw away?", "YTA. Bad parenting. You should have taken the switch away for a few weeks then spoken to your son. If he gets an allowance, you could also make him replace the product he threw away.", "YTA. Next time; take him with you on that emergency shopping. Let him pay for the pads. \n\nThan you teach him that hygienic products are really necessary, and not to be played with like with a switch. \n\nRevenge is not parenting, teaching is.", "Sell it and use it to buy a bunch of pads", "A 9 year old reacted badly to his sister so you adults react badly in return? Also, if the switch could be taken out of the trash why couldn't wrapped sanitary items be taken out? Help your children understand each better instead of resent one another.", "Okay.\n\n1) yes what your son did was cruel, I\u2019m a afab person (assigned female at birth) and if I found out my someone threw away my tampons I would obviously lose my shit depending on the age. So, does your son know why she needs those feminine hygiene products? Does he understand what a period is?\n\n2) responding to anger with anger, is just a bad idea. So to that YTA. Like I understand what point you were trying to make but\u2026saying that throwing away things is bad\u2026by throwing away his thing is just\u2026???? Confusing\u2026to say the least. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll teach him anything besides just throw everything that isn\u2019t trash away. Sorry if this sounds harsh, but you\u2019re the parent.

This was a crappy move in my opinion", "**You're not the wrong party here.** As a parent, you acted to protect your daughter and show your son the consequences of his actions.

Mic needs to understand why his actions were cruel and the discomfort they caused to his sister.

It's time to educate him not giving him petty punishments. And which part of OP's story talks about girl gamers? Stop projecting", "Kids may be *exposed* to more faster, but they definitely do not grow up and start to distinguish right from wrong, understand long term planning, or learn empathy any quicker.", "You\u2019re a 12 year old girl gamer, right?", "I'm assuming you don't realize that gamers usually choose the female avatar to stare at the ass, or because the creation control is better and sometimes for both reasons.\n\n>his character would be female... for the foreseeable future.", "Oh no a female character how terrifying", ">He threw out 5-10 USD in consumables. The mother's reaction was to throw out 350+ dollars of his things (realistically, probably 500-1000 since it made all his games worthless)\n\nSure, you and I know what these things cost, but a 9 year old doesn't. I think that commentor's framing is fair from the kid's perspective. However I agree with you, that OP's behavior was remarkably childish for being the adult here.", "She had to sit on the toilet while her mom ent to the store and wait to get back to have sanitary pads. That\u2019s more than throwing stuff out, that\u2019s a whole lot of humiliation. Now I don\u2019t think OP was right to permanently throw out his switch, but damn, let\u2019s compare apples to apples.", "Not judging the whole situation, ESH, but name brand pads can go for like $10 a pack easy even at Walmart. If the daughter has especially heavy periods and is struggling to find something that works then she could easily have $50 worth of goods.\n\n\n Plus tbh it's not even the monetary value that's the issue, what he did was like taking all the toilet paper from a bathroom and leaving them stranded. The idea of soiling yourself with blood on your period is feels humilating for folks, and probably even moreso with a teen struggling with what seems like a menstrual imbalance.", "I doubt a 9 year old boy understands much about periods, hormones and cramps. He ignorantly tried to inconvenience her. He deserves to lose the Switch for a week and buy her new pads. If he was 16 it would be different.", "Lol no", "She clearly was, because she started whining when her husband took it out of the trash to lock it away like a normal person.", "I doubt the 9 year old was gonna keep the pads in the trash also", "The kid is 9. The 13 year old was mistreating him.\n\nTeach your kids things.", "He\u2019s 9. He likely hasn\u2019t had The Talk yet. To him, they were probably just the new thing she had.", "No one said anything about women being able to act however they want because of their period. Just stop it.", "That's what I was thinking if it was like dry food nothing is wrong with it if it was wet then  that would be a totally different story.", "She's 13, she's probably not used to periods and they are usually pretty difficult to get adjusted to early on. Some girls have far more intense ones so you can't really use anecdotal evidence as to why one Simone can manage it better. \n\nAlso she wasn't even treating him bad, she got snippy because he was being loud playing a game. For siblings, that's practically nothing, lol.", "Upon reviewing your account, it appears that your qualifications to engage in this discussion may be insufficient. It is crucial to understand that the onset of menstruation and associated hormonal imbalances can be particularly challenging for young individuals. It's important to clarify that my comments primarily addressed the appropriate consequences for the son's actions, and not those of the daughter. While it is clear that no inappropriate behavior should go unpunished, the daughter's circumstances warrant sensitive consideration rather than immediate dismissal.", "Eh, let\u2019s not teach little boys that periods are something to make fun of.", "Nope, again I have a daughter in a similar age range (8)She\u2019s a gamer too. If a family member isn\u2019t feeling well, my daughter knows not to be loud. Cause ya know, she cares about other people\u2019s well being. :) nice try though", "Oh mb then, thanks for explaining it", "Yes I would. As you mentioned, he is 9. He knew what he was doing and specifically went for her sanitary pads and stuff she NEEDED while she was changing them. She was expressing her issues and he threw a tantrum that not only caused the sister difficulty, but also the op who needed to go get more. Also lmao what do kicking balls have to do with anything? Didn't even mention it.", "It's a machine that replicates cramps that someone experiences in a period.", "Yup. Exposure to more things (good or bad) doesn\u2019t change how long it takes a human brain to grow.", "Perfect way to teach empathy is to turn all his characters female.", "Haha...  Gen-x gamer and developer.", "Right!?  \ud83d\ude02. Has this person met a male gamer?", "This is Fortnite too LOL. Isn\u2019t that like Minecraft?  (I\u2019m old).  Does it even have female characters?  \ud83d\ude04", "And the issue isn't the cost of the items, its that she didn't have access to them when she needed them.  Leaving her essentially stuck in the bathroom if she had already removed the old one.  When you really need one, a single pad is priceless.", "Why did she have to wait on the toilet? Couldn't she make an emergency pad out of toilet paper like pretty much every woman has done at some point?", "He knew enough to know that the reason she\u2019s not feeling well is tired to her being on her period and intentionally threw out the products that he knows she needs to use in order to manage her period. He knew what he was doing was wrong. He did it anyways. I\u2019m not saying OP should throw the switch away I think that\u2019s a bit extreme, but to say the son \u201cignorantly\u201d tried to inconvenience her is not what\u2019s happening here. He knew what he was doing, he bragged about it to his friends. He wasn\u2019t ignorant he was intentional", "[deleted]", "Um \ud83d\ude02 have you met a nine year old? Yes he would have LOL", "Yes in fact thats what I said in my original comment even but thats not relevant to what I replied to you. Comparing expense alone doesn't represent this situation.", "As I just replied, thats just not what I'm saying here - this comment is saying a switch is worse to theow away than pads due to expense, but money does not account for the vulnerable position this puts a young girl in.", "OP sure seems to be justifying her daughters behaviour by saying its because she was feeling shitty", "Did you read the post lol", "OP literally did just that. She allowed her daughter to speak to her son disrespectfully and excused it bc of her period. She had no punishment but the son did. I smell favoritism", ">Too many women are expected to hide our discomfort, and I\u2019m glad you have your daughter\u2019s back.\n\nHad her back... bullying her little brother?\n\nWhat was her punishment for acting like a brat?\n\nYou are literally supporting \"women being able to act however they want because of their period.\"\n\nIf you want to raise a boy to hate women, this is a great start.", "So 9 year old son can just take the abuse from sis and mom cause... hes a boy. \n\nRight? Cause that's what you're saying.\n\nThere is ways to teach your children lessons. You don't need to act like abusive children.", "Boys will be boys though, right? \ud83d\ude44", "HE IS NINE and again period is not an excuse to be snippy", "I was putting the pain in terms that a man would understand. The period cramp thing is only self-explanatory if you are a woman. A man would understand getting kicked in the balls, but not necessarily period cramps. I don't know what gender you are, so I want to make absolutely sure you understand what you are suggesting: a disgusting act of physical abuse.", "As you said, he is nine. Nine is a little boy. I just want to be clear here\u2026 you\u2019re saying you would kick a little boy in his privates, correct?", "Well, yeah, I gathered that. I was just wondering if it was real or not. I see a product that has been demo'd, but not one available commercially.", "Teach empathy by forcing a gender of his avatar?\n\n That sounds extremely problematic", "How? They're characters in a game, everything they say and do is either scripted or controlled by the player, none of which translates to this situation. OP is TA for sure. He may have some knowledge about pads, but it's doubtful he understands their actual significance. This was a huge learning opportunity for both kids and OP missed the mark as a parent. If trying to teach your kids empathy is the goal, demonstrating \"an eye for an eye\" isn't the way to go about it.", "Huh, GenX here too.  I thought we were too old to call 9 year olds toxic little brats and stuff.  That\u2019s the type of crap I hear teens say.", "You are expecting a lot from a 9-year-old when just two or three years ago, his parents were still wiping his butt for him. The only thing he understood was how to be an asshole to someone who was an asshole to him from his perspective.", "... but he didn't do it just to hurt her for no reason? \n\n\n\"She is not feeling well and he is tired of that\" is not what happened. His sister let her mood out on him and tried to tell him what to do. While his behaviour was not okay, you are doing a really bad job to represent his pesperltive. \n\n\nHe is playing with his friends, not annying her intentionally at all. \n\n\nHis sister used a not-okay tone - that very likely his friends heard- to tell him what to do. The sister should've gone to her parents in the first place if the son should move to play to another room or tone it down. .\n\n\nHe reacted to it. Badly yes. But being snapped at without having done anything and being 9 years old do have something to with this.", "Yeah, this is definitely toxic masculinity.  I'm curious if he's playing with other 9 year olds or older guys who may be strangers", "No shit. Throwing away a $400 device is overkill. Agree to disagree.", "I mean, mean most kids are potty trained at three, not seven.  A nine year old is capable of empathy and some self control.\n\nIf he's not, then he shouldn't be playing games with people who are encouraging this kind of bad behavior.", "Toxic masculinity? He is 9! He wouldn't be able to define masculinity if you put him on its Wikipedia page", "[deleted]", "Lol so you're expecting better behaviour from the 9 year old than his older sibling and his parent, an actual adult? Kid was a little jerk, no doubt about it but I think you're giving him too much credit.", "When all you have is a hammer\u2026", "Ah yes! Reward her for also being a jerk! Brilliant! /s", "Yes, reenforced sibling resentment! A perfect solution!\n\nSister is 13 and going to be dealing with her period for a long time. She needs to figure out ways to cope with the hormones and her mother needs to not be using her period as an excuse to let her be rude to people.", "why should she be rewarded she caused the problem", "bruh"]}
