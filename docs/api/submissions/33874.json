For context I didn't have a good childhood and my mother created so many issues in my life that most of my family on her side has decided to stay away from us. She was very abusive and now in my adult life every time I try and work on having a relationship with her she finds some reason to hurt me. when we got engaged I was very excited we were at that point talking and getting along so I texted her to let her know before we posted on social media or told anyone else. she read it but didn't respond we waited till the next day and posted it. Well she went on a text attack and called me worthless and a loser among many other names and told me to forget her and her family because none of them want anything to do with me. \n\nI was hurt so in talking with my now husband I said this is why I didn't want to get married. I will never have a support system from her or my family. My husband said a big wedding with all of our family wasn't something he needed and we could get married in a court house and he would be happy. So we had a small beach wedding with his mom our son and a few close friends. it was perfect and beautiful and I couldn't have been happier. We decided that we would have a reception/celebration on our 1 year anniversary and anyone who wanted could come and if they don't that's okay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI invited my mother and \"her family\" my mother declined but the family RSVP and texted and called and said they were so happy and excited for me and couldn't wait to come and celebrate with us. Well word got to my mother that they were coming she called and said I needed to un-invite them!! She said they hurt her by cutting her off and it is rotten of me to invite them and shows how I am a narcissist and manipulative??? I told her I wasn't un-inviting anyone that it was important to me that they want to come. She said if I don't I am showing my true colors and how they are only coming so they can make fun of me. I feel like she isn't coming so why cant they? Mind you they have to fly to be here and most have already booked their flights!

She has who's the narcissist entirely backwards.", "Your mom is a very functionally perfect example of projection, really.   \n\n\nShe's calling you a manipulative narcissist because... well, SHE IS. \n\nI'm sad for you. I'm sad that you probably COULD have had whatever ceremony you wanted and your side of the family WOULD have come, just without your awful mother.  \n\n\nLet this be a lesson to you. Always let people speak for themselves. I'm so happy for you that your family is coming to your reception.\n\n  \nNot that this is an advice subreddit, but I would STRONGLY convince you to go full no-contact with your mother.

She thinks your event should be about her absence, rather than your marriage. Nothing more needs to be said to your mom about this. You\u2019re wasting your breath. \n\nHow lovely that you find that your maternal family are willing to fly to celebrate you!

You deserve more. \n\nI\u2019m so happy you and your husband found each other.", "Time to cut off the toxic mother and enjoy your husband and the family you have created. He sounds lovely. \n\nI think that you'll hear a lot of helpful information from your mother's side of the family -- about your mother.

You don't have to engage with toxic people -- give yourself permission to cut your mother off like the rest of your family did. They obviously do not hold her against you and just couldn't be around you while you were a minor and in your mother's care, not because of you, but because of her. Don't let her near you, your husband or your kid and embrace the people who want the best for you, which clearly does not include her.", "Something is wrong with your mother (narcissism?) , but that's neither here nor there. NTA she made her bed, and crapped all over it. It feels like a theme for her. She got disowned for a reason, then had the gull to disown you. For what? She hoped she broke you and isolated you. You have found someone who loves you, and reconnected with the rest of the family. She has no power over you. Ignore her. Your other family members wouldn't waste money on flights in this economy to just play a cruel joke.", "NTA and momma is batshit crazy.", "NTA - except why in the world are you having any contact with this woman at all???  BLOCK!!!  Hard Block!!\n\nDo not uninvite anyone, and I'm hoping the flight requirement serves as a buffer from your Egg Donor showing up uninvited.", "You said this more elegantly than I. It doesn\u2019t seem out of the realm of possibility that her mother was working as a buffer to keep a support system away from OP. \n\nThe NC should be done by blocking all contact with her so that her messages don\u2019t even get through to OP.", "Thank you for your compliment."]}
