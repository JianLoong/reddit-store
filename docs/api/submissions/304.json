I know this is an emotional thing for you, but you can\u2019t hold your dog\u2019s death over other people\u2019s lives for that long. Why shouldn\u2019t your siblings be able to have a pet? You had one when you were their age and it was a big part of your life. Plus you are already planning on moving out and you\u2019ve mentioned you are hardly at home, so you can\u2019t expect them to make decisions centered around you like this.\n\nYou are an adult. If you don\u2019t like your family\u2019s choices of what they do in their house then move out.", "YTA.\n\nWhat makes you think you are the boss of the whole family?\n\nYour current dislike of pets is not logical, and you yourself can't even explain it.  I'm not a psychologist but it seems to me that maybe you are putting up a defense against ever getting close to another pet because somehow it would be dishonoring the memory of the dog you lost.\n\nA decent grieving period is normal, but it's been 2 years. Get over yourself.", "I couldn\u2019t even finish reading this, YTA big time, because you are unutterably selfish. Who are you to dictate terms? Go see a psychiatrist for your problems. Don\u2019t wreck it for everyone else and quit being mean to that poor little cat. Someone should hiss you away from home. You sound insufferable. Sorry about your dog, but that is YOUR issue. You don\u2019t sound like much of an animal lover anyway if you act like this. Move out and quit making everyone around you miserable.", "YTA and also being incredibly immature. Losing a pet is hard, but unfortunately, that's life, and our pets don't stay around forever. It would be best if you worked on your trauma with losing your dog as you're reacting negatively towards it (I mean seriously?? Hissing back at a cat and making it think like it did something wrong?). You say you're barely home, about to move out in 2 years, and you're holding your younger siblings from enjoying something you got to enjoy.  \n\n\nYes, YTA, and you're also being immature about this.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your house, it\u2019s not your choice. And abusing animals will not give you a pass. Go get some therapy or move to a cheaper place sooner", "YTA for not getting your mental health issues addressed by professionals. Holding your family hostage to your grief is not good and where will it end?", "YTA. Get over yourself.", "YTA anyway because your attitude towards your siblings getting pets but you\u2019re especially TA for hissing away a stray cat who is feeling safe enough to enter the home.", "YTA Your miserable so everyone else should be too??????", "YTA.  I'm sorry that your dog died but that doesn't give you the right to prevent everyone around you from ever having another pet.", "YTA. Not your house for one, and two why are you going out of yout way to scare off a hungry stray?", "YTA I hope no one's gonna argue", "YTA. This is so horrendous I can\u2019t even express my feelings about it. Grief is horrible. But you don\u2019t get to be an emotional terrorist indefinitely", "YTA. You need to deal with your grief for the dog because your attitude and behaviour isn't healthy.", "YATA you have no right to decide what aver people want live isn't just about you just because you are sad anyone else doesn't have to be too \nGrow up or work harder to move out", "Yta and I\u2019m surprised your parents have allowed you to think you\u2019ve got this kind of say as long as they have.", "YTA and you are in desperate need of mental health services.", "Yta. And it sounds near serial killer levels", "YTA", "Soft YTA. I really think you would benefit from therapy. You\u2019re grieving over the loss of your dog, and I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through that - trust me, I love my dog, too, and I can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019re going through right now.
