{"id": 29866, "submission_id": "17ikqza", "title": "AITA for arguing with strangers at Cici's pizza over their screaming child?", "selftext": "More like is my mom the a-hole. So my mom (52F) and I (24F) went to Cici's pizza last night, and there was a couple sitting a couple tables behind us with a kid in a high chair who was probably around 3 years old. As we're eating, the kid screams. It was one of those really high pitch screams you hear in a horror movie. The kid wasn't upset either; the parents were playing around and joking with him, which prompted the scream. We heard the mom quietly going \"Ah! Ah!\" while she was playing with him, and we think the kid was mimicking, but obviously louder. \n\nThe first time we hear the scream, we're thinking wow that's annoying, but it's a kid. It happens. Then it happens 2 more times, just as annoying as the first. The parents aren't even trying to get the kid to stop. The 2nd and 3rd time, I noticed everyone in the restaurant looking over at the kid because they're likely getting annoyed. \n\nI'm talking to my mom, and we're saying stuff like, \"the kid's mom is encouraging it, and they aren't trying to get him to stop.\" Then my mom starts saying, \"when you were that little and would scream in public, I would do xyz to teach you not to do that.\" Then, the dad at the other table shouts to my mom, \"if you have something to say, just say it!\" To which my mom replied, \"I did.\" The kid's mom *slams* her hands down on the table like child and shouts, \"he's a TODDLER!\" And the argument breaks out from there but only lasts a few seconds. We basically just said that we're free to say what we want and we weren't even talking to you. We didn't yell at them, but they were yelling at us just saying he's a toddler, you must not have kids, you don't understand. Yada yada, you get the point. \n\nI also want to mention that my mom and I were just talking to each other. We didn't insult them or anything, and most of our conversation was my mom saying how she handled me and my brother when we misbehaved as kids. We weren't passive aggressively talking loud so they would hear us. We were talking a little lower than our normal speaking voices.\n\nThe kid screamed at least 2 more times after the argument.\n\nWho's the a-hole?\n\nEdit: *how did they hear you if you werent talking loud?* We had one table in between us and it was empty, and our side of the restaurant had half-wall dividers separating our tables from the rest of the seats. Plus, I remember them getting really quiet right before they yelled at us, so I'm confident they stopped talking and intentionally listened in.", "created_utc": 1698520291, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ikqza/aita_for_arguing_with_strangers_at_cicis_pizza/", "score": 112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
