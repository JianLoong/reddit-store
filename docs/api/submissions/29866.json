So my mom (52F) and I (24F) went to Cici's pizza last night, and there was a couple sitting a couple tables behind us with a kid in a high chair who was probably around 3 years old. As we're eating, the kid screams. It was one of those really high pitch screams you hear in a horror movie. The kid wasn't upset either; the parents were playing around and joking with him, which prompted the scream. We heard the mom quietly going \"Ah! Ah!\" while she was playing with him, and we think the kid was mimicking, but obviously louder. \n\nThe first time we hear the scream, we're thinking wow that's annoying, but it's a kid. It happens. Then it happens 2 more times, just as annoying as the first. The parents aren't even trying to get the kid to stop. The 2nd and 3rd time, I noticed everyone in the restaurant looking over at the kid because they're likely getting annoyed. \n\nI'm talking to my mom, and we're saying stuff like, \"the kid's mom is encouraging it, and they aren't trying to get him to stop.\" Then my mom starts saying, \"when you were that little and would scream in public, I would do xyz to teach you not to do that.\" Then, the dad at the other table shouts to my mom, \"if you have something to say, just say it!\" To which my mom replied, \"I did.\" The kid's mom *slams* her hands down on the table like child and shouts, \"he's a TODDLER!\" And the argument breaks out from there but only lasts a few seconds. We basically just said that we're free to say what we want and we weren't even talking to you. We didn't yell at them, but they were yelling at us just saying he's a toddler, you must not have kids, you don't understand. Yada yada, you get the point. \n\nI also want to mention that my mom and I were just talking to each other. We didn't insult them or anything, and most of our conversation was my mom saying how she handled me and my brother when we misbehaved as kids. We weren't passive aggressively talking loud so they would hear us. We were talking a little lower than our normal speaking voices.\n\nThe kid screamed at least 2 more times after the argument.\n\nWho's the a-hole?\n\nEdit: *how did they hear you if you werent talking loud?* We had one table in between us and it was empty, and our side of the restaurant had half-wall dividers separating our tables from the rest of the seats. Plus, I remember them getting really quiet right before they yelled at us, so I'm confident they stopped talking and intentionally listened in.", "created_utc": 1698520291, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ikqza/aita_for_arguing_with_strangers_at_cicis_pizza/", "score": 378, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If that's an arcade, it's pretty pathetic", "The \"arcade\" is literally 4 skill crane games lol", "In their house?", "Outside has traditionally been a good place to scream.", "> Why else would my mom be sitting at a table with someone half her age if it wasn't her adult kid lol\n\nOnce you're an adult, you can have friends of all ages. My mother's best friend is only a couple of years older than my sister. (Although we actually did refer to her as \"our sister\" as we were discussing end of life options with the doctors. It was easier than \"we're waiting for this unrelated third party to show up and help us determine Mommy's wishes\".)", "I'm a sarcastic little so-and-so, so I might have piped up 'well if I started screaming, my mom would still take me outside until I stopped.' And since the apple didn't fall far from the tree, my mom would likely have said 'damn right. You are a bit bigger now, so it wouldn't be pretty.' Love my mom!", "I love this! Outside voice- never heard that before! Definitely going to be teaching my toddler outside vs inside voice, as she\u2019s loving opposites right now. Thanks for sharing!", "Your poor neighbours.", "Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding", "That's hilarious. \ud83d\ude02 I thought that \"Pomeranian\" was an autocorrect mix-up and you were talking about a year-old child at first.", "It's made so you can eat cheap pizza", "Oh, dear. Are you dragging up some semon demons without noise boundaries or respect for other people?", "Exactly this. I wouldn't even be annoyed if the parents were trying but the kid was just being a terror. The lack of effort and consideration is what is irritating", "Very pathetic.", "As a former kid with poor volume control, the idea that you didn\u2019t grow up hearing \u201cinside voice\u201d a thousand times is mind-boggling to me. I got shushed so often lmao", "I agree. I live across from where most of the kids in our condos play. There have been some screechers that make me dread summer. I don\u2019t mind yelling. It\u2019s the ones just making screaming noises for hours that get to me."]}
