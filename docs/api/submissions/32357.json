(Some of your friends certainly fell for it.) In reality, *she* is the one who chose to wear your clothing without permission and, in doing so, ruined several garments.  She was old enough to know better; there's no excuse for what she did.\n\nMaybe your friends need to check clothing prices before they start lecturing you on how wrong it was to \"hurt\" your friend's feelings simply because she betrayed your trust and you called her on it.", "NTA she ruined your clothes. She doesn\u2019t get to play the victim.", "NTA your friend should ask permission to wear your clothes just like how she asked to put her clothes in your house. With her logic you could throw your crap in her house without asking bc you\u2019re friends but if you did she would most likely be pissed.", "NTA\n\nI cannot believe that she somehow thought that housing your clothing translated into it being \u201ca given\u201d that she\u2019d borrow them. She\u2019s a bad friend. I\u2019m sorry that she\u2019s not trustworthy or considerate with others\u2019 belongings.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been discussing this with your other friends, stop. It\u2019s not their clothing. They\u2019re going to naturally side with the person who feels that their weight was attacked even though that\u2019s not the case. If outsiders bring it up, remind them that this is between you and one other person and that their input isn\u2019t welcome.\n\nWhile I think that she should replace *everything* she\u2019s ruined, I don\u2019t see that happening outside of you dragging this into small claims court, if they\u2019ll handle it there. Your best bet would be to cut bait and find better friends. You don\u2019t need her dusty ass in your life.", "NTA it\u2019s not a given, if she wanted to use your clothes she needed to get your permission. She did not. She further damaged your clothes via her use. She owes you the cost.", "Nta-she should have asked first. Yeah she was storing it but it's still your stuff.", "NTA.\n\nStoring clothes is **not permission** to borrow clothes. What on earth is she thinking? And permission to borrow is not permission to damage. You can feel if you are stretching things out. She is making silly excuses.", "NTA in no way is someone entitled to use your stuff when you didn't offer, much less in a way that changes them. \n\nIt sounds like shes either pulling a sympathy card to make you the jerk or has a delusional sense of entitlement. I would have a serious talk with her. At the end of the day, she used your things without permission and changed the fit of your clothes, potentially making them unwearable.", "What im wondering is how much all the clothes that she stretched combined cost, if its 4 t-shirts from Goodwill then no shit ur the a-hole but if its actually good stuff then shes a a-hole for not asking you in advance if she could try your clothes on", "NTA\n\nThey were your clothes. She agreed to store them. That\u2019s not an agreement to lend them to her for wearing.\n\nShe\u2019s the AH here, and so are any of your friends who think you\u2019re an AH for expecting her to replace anything you can no longer wear.", "NTA \n\nwhat I\u2019ve learned from this is that you have a friend that can\u2019t be trusted to take care of your things. I have been storing my friends (dang near sister just packing in blood ties) stuff at my home for over 6 months. I haven\u2019t even opened the box because it isn\u2019t my stuff. She asked me to store her things, not go through them and use them as my own. And then she damaged your items and gave you a flimsy excuse instead of an apology with a promise to make it right, I don\u2019t like that friend.", "NTA.  I don't see how holding on a few of your boxes equates to rummaging through them and using them.  I currently have four boxes of a friend's in my basement.  I have zero idea what is in them other than it's \"kitchen stuff\".  I wouldn't dream of touching those boxes, let alone go through them and use whatever is in there!  That is unacceptable behavior.  Close friends don't do this to one another.", "NTA - calling something as it is (the fabrics being stretched and damaged) isn\u2019t a personal attack on her body, and her hiding behind her anger of feeling that doesn\u2019t excuse the fact that she damaged/ruined your items. How would she feel if this was another product and not clothes? What if you left a drone at her place and she flew it and broke it? She\u2019d most likely pay for it then\u2026 if she wasn\u2019t a crappy friend.\n\nYTA - asking for money for them when she was keeping them for free is a grey area leaning towards A\u2026 I\u2019d maybe ask her to split the cost with you, but since she can\u2019t get over her own body image issues to realize the facts of the situation (she ruined your stuff) you should realize you\u2019re probably not gonna collect anything. So is the $200 worth your friendship? If not, probably just have to let it go and never let her touch your stuff again.", "NTA.  If she wanted to wear your clothes she should have asked first.  It is NOT a given that storing your things there means she has free rein to do what she wants with them.", "NTA. Behavior like this is very telling about people. Unfortunately, your friend might not be as much of your friend as you think. Sure, they're just clothes. But that's not the point. The point is the lack of respect for you and your things, no sense of remorse over doing something that upset you, and immediately jumps to playing the victim after doing something they are objectively in the wrong for.", "NTA. This is not a given. She\u2019s not 16. This is high school nonsense. She had no right to go through your stuff, let alone damage it.", "Nta", "NTA does that mean storage locker owners can help themselves to their customers stuff because that's a given??? Tell your friend to pay up for damaging all your clothes.", "NTA,\n\nYour friend has a serious lack of boundaries.. and sometimes we have to choose our possessions over our friends.. \n\nMy close mate, because I'm emigrating next week, says to me.. \"so I'm taking your car\" and I told him.. not on his fucking life is he.. he's 40 with a learners license.. my car is staying where it is until I come back to take my car and drive it across the continent..", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is not expected that your friend would wear your clothes.", "WTF! You're almost a foot taller than she is, and totally different shape. What could possibly make her think it was ok to try on your clothes?", "NTA. Just because she is letting you store some stuff at her house doesn't mean it's her free wardrobe. If she wanted to borrow clothes she should have asked first. She also shouldn't really be so upset that the clothes stretched because your bodies are different. It's factual information.\n\nNot that I would do this but it would be like me, a size 18 wearing my sister a size 12 clothes and getting offended if she told me I stretched them. Like of course I did. I'm bigger than you.", "NTA\n\nI am fat and I understand how difficult it is to find new clothes and how tempting it can be when no your friends clothes fit and are beautiful etc etc. I also know a lot of redditors will say they are fat and then show their internalised fatphobia, and I want to make it clear this is not that. \n\nShe didn\u2019t even ask! She ruined your clothes! She should have told you that a condition of storing the clothes in her home would be she could borrow them and if she destroyed them she would not repair or replace them. Informed consent is key, and she didn\u2019t get any before destroying your clothes. \n\nPeople shouldn\u2019t borrow clothes without permission, especially clothes that can be ruined if worn by someone they aren\u2019t made for. My wife is thinner than me and has a slightly larger shoe size. If she wears my shoes they stretch and aren\u2019t comfortable and essentially no longer fit me as well. Some clothes we can share and some we can\u2019t. It\u2019s not a slight, it\u2019s trying to make sure we don\u2019t burn through our clothes and have to buy new ones all the time. \n\nI\u2019m sorry she ruined your clothes.", "Even at my age it always amazes me that \u201c friends \u201c will do you dirty like this .Lesson learned OP.She\u2019s full of it \u2014she refuses to admit her wrong doing and tried to make you into the bad guy .\nNTA OP.\n\nNext time I\u2019d try to rent a small space for storage for anything I valued\u2026", "If I confront her again, it feels like I'm choosing between longtime friends or the cost of clothes?", "I tried telling her that it's truly just because we have very different body types/shapes but all she heard was me calling her fat. I don't know how I could've worded it better tbh, but I still worry that all I did was insult her, yet I'm sitting here in my new place with ruined clothes and she's turning all of our friends against me.", "It was tops and a shirt, not from Goodwill, the kinda tops you'd wear to a nice dinner or party. I had no issue until I realised they had, yeah, been stretched beyond repair. And they weren't cheap", "That's fair. She was keeping them in a spare bedroom she never used, but I absolutely understand your point. Have just been very conflicted considering she said it was no issue and I didn't anticipate her wearing my clothes without asking. It was only a small closets worth, and a couple pairs of shoes.", "I'll definitely be doing that in the future. Lesson learned. Thank you :)", "NTA. If I were offered a choice between my expensive clothes that I liked being in good shape and fitting me or a friend who took them, stretched them out so they no longer looked right when I wore them and then attacked me for being upset falsely claiming it was bigotry, I'd choose the clothes. I don't need friends with that lack of ethics.", "Why do you want to be friends with someone who treats your belongings, and ultimately you, like this?", "I'm sorry. That sucks.", "If you want to keep her as a friend maybe just let her know you\u2019re upset and had to throw them all out because they were ruined and that isn\u2019t an attack on her it\u2019s just a fact (again bring up the drone argument\u2026 would she pay for that if she broke it?). Then don\u2019t let her borrow your things anymore (imo) because she\u2019s shown she\u2019ll ruin/break your stuff. Definitely a tough situation to be in.", "I'll hopefully find a way to make things right. Thank you", "She's the one who needs to make things right, you know."]}
