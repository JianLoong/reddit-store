She\u2019d most likely pay for it then\u2026 if she wasn\u2019t a crappy friend.\n\nYTA - asking for money for them when she was keeping them for free is a grey area leaning towards A\u2026 I\u2019d maybe ask her to split the cost with you, but since she can\u2019t get over her own body image issues to realize the facts of the situation (she ruined your stuff) you should realize you\u2019re probably not gonna collect anything.

Not that you should have to coddle an adult but some people are super sensitive and if you love them it can be worth sparing their feelings. \n\nAnyway, you didn\u2019t insult her. She feels inferior to you because of your relative body types so she immediately assumes you\u2019re calling her fat. She\u2019s the one calling herself fat in her own head \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "She knows what she did is wrong and is attempting to confuse you.", "I would consider that stealing. She borrowed your stuff without asking for permission on whether she could wear it or not. \n\nI\u2019m surprised you aren\u2019t as upset and am still worried about insulting her. She treated your clothes like trash.", "I suspect she knows she was in the wrong, which is why she is being defensive. NTA. And regardless of body types, storing clothes for someone is not the same as permission to try them on.", "You have nothing to apologize for OP. My sister and I sometimes exchange clothes but we also know some items don\u2019t fit the same. I\u2019m three inches taller but 10 pounds lighter. She\u2019s got a nice booty and I\u2019ve got NONE. She\u2019s got boobs and I\u2019m nearly flat on top. Pants don\u2019t fit us the same AT ALL. Same with some tops. And the fact your friend \u201cborrowed\u201d without asking is totally crossing the line.", "I\u2019m guessing she is probably very self-conscious about her body and projecting her insecurity into insults. NTA. Her borrowing your clothes and ruining them is kind of sh***y.", "That is a reflection of what she thinks about herself. I'd pray for her to get over her body image issues and find peace with herself.", "You should Google DARVO, your friend sucks.", "Hold up, exactly how long did you leave a closet full of clothes at her place that she was able to ruin so much? Storage units cost $50+ every month and you gave her a single candle? She shouldn't have worn your clothes without asking, but jfc, ESH", "because she knows shes fat", ">I tried telling her that it's truly just because we have very different body types/shapes but all she heard was me calling her fat. I don't know how I could've worded it better tbh, \n\nSoft YTA. She shouldn't have borrowed your clothes, for sure, but you could have just told her you don't like loaning your clothes out to people, so please don't do it again. Your problem was you explained it. That hurt her feelings. Yes, she's in the wrong, but depending on how good the friendship is, I'd have just left it at that and expect that she not do it again. If she did, the answer would be totally different.", "You can win the friend PR game by making it about the boobs.  \u201cLook guys, I didn\u2019t want to make this the focus because it\u2019s awkward and embarrassing, but the problem is that Friend has a much larger chest than I do. She\u2019s always been blessed with that chest so she doesn\u2019t realize what it\u2019s like to have so much less volume. If clothing fits over her bosom, there\u2019s almost no chance that it will fit me.  I cannot afford to replace everything that is no longer usable and I would likely violate indecent exposure laws if I wore that clothing in its current state. Friend was doing this favor to help me save money. It would have been far cheaper to rent the storage place I couldn\u2019t afford.", "They aren't your friends. You said your friends are saying you chose clothes over your friend's feelings. She did the same thing to you but worse. Honestly, a good group of friends would call your friend out on her shit. Tell her to leave weight out of it. The point is the clothes are ruined. Die on this hill. If your clothes were luxury goods, if it were me, I would consider small claims court. It does depend on how long you left the clothes there.", "Honestly I don\u2019t think she thought you were calling her fat; she knew she ruined your clothes and she wanted to wiggle out of blame and avoid having to pay for the stuff she damaged.\n\nNTA- she was storing your clothes- storing things for someone doesn\u2019t mean you get free reign over them. Hell even if you think it does mean you can use them you have to be an idiot to think that means you\u2019re free to ruin them.\n\nShe knew they didn\u2019t fit her right and she knew she was stretching your clothes out and making them unusable. She\u2019s just trying to avoid repercussions", "Do you want to salvage a friendship with someone who ruins your clothes and then tries to manipulate all your friends to get away with it?", "Sorry OP, she's already not your friend. Friends don't do that", "And they say you can\u2019t put a price on friendship.", "She already chose wearing your clothes without permission, ruining them and not offering to reimburse them over friendship with you. She values you as someone she fan disrespect - that\u2019s not a friend.", "Buddy, it looks like she has already chosen for you.", "You get to decide if this is your hill or not. But either way, you are NTA.", "She shouldn't have been going through your stuff in the first place. She was snooping. Don't trust her with your things ever again.", "It definitely depends on how many she ruined but since she\u2019s being crazy about it, I\u2019d let her win this round if you want to keep the friendship", "If they weren\u2019t cheap, and if you have already lost the friends (who weren\u2019t really friends) over this, then you might want to consider small claims court if that is a thing where you live.", "A ruined clothes darvo", "I've let her know this and am waiting to hear back. Thank you, I really do appreciate it", "Just writing to say very few people today know how to rationally win an argument- truly a dying art, and you nailed it.", "I would, but I've already put them in storage. Didn't think I'd need photographic evidence, sorry", "If OP posted online, that would be bordering on trying to embarrass the friend. If you meant in a group chat though, that\u2019s a great idea!", "I'll definitely be taking this on board, because you're absolutely right in your approach. Having a bigger chest is awesome and I wish, maybe I came towards it with the wrong angle. But that's a great approach.", "thats anti semetic", "Sorry, I mentioned this in another comment. She was storing them in a spare bedroom that she rarely used, and all items were able to fit in the wardrobe. It definitely wasn't a hindrance to her or taking up necessary space. Yes, all I gave her was a single candle but considering she agreed and there seemed to be no issue, I did assume that to be the case, yes.", "Way too generous and lenient, she\u2019s being walked all over and the friend is reversing the blame on purpose because she knows she fucked up but doesn\u2019t care.", "I don\u2019t think OP meant just the single friend, but also all the other friends that are being turned against OP.\n\nBut then again, your question still holds- why would OP want to be friends with people who think that that kind of treatment of OP/OP\u2019s belongings was ok?", "Look, you're not wrong, yeah.", "I'll definitely be having a singular chat with her in private and see how it goes from there. It was up to $400 in terms of clothes that can't really be salvaged. I'm considering everything here.", "\"I didn't ruin the clothes. You ruined the clothes. And you ruined our relationship.\" LOL.", "Agree with the argument here. She wore your clothes without asking and ruined them, all without telling you. She could have worn them on a farm and got holes in them, or spilled wine on them, or caught a sleeve in a door and ripped it. She damaged your clothes. She needs to pay to replace or repair them.", "I think not making it about the size but the damage was really good advice already. However if she persists on the fat shaming argument in order to make a point I wouldn't feel bad go lie and be like \"oh no you just have more muscles\" or sth like this. You didn't call her fat, don't get cornered.", "Consider trying to wash them in hot water and dry them on hot.  Sometimes it can help", "No prob just thought it would help your case.  Well now you find out who your true friends are.", "No, I meant for friends only, not public embarrassment.", "Oh yeah that really sucks I\u2019d let her know what she damaged and ask again at least. Some people have crazy boundaries", "no it was that massive stomach bone that stretched it", "I'll try that! Thank you", "I thought it was cold water that did that", "I know, and I do appreciate it. I'll be having a conversation with her", "Careful! Hot water and hot temperatures can damage clothes, especially designed or nicer fabrics", "I mean, at this point it's either OP doesn't wear them because they're stretched beyond their ability to wear them, OP tries the hot wash trick and it works, or OP tries the hot wash trick and it doesn't work.\n\n2 out of 3 aren't great outcomes. May as well try and hope that OP can wear them again.", "Tailoring sucks, but wouldn\u2019t damage the fabrics more. Agreed it\u2019s all bad options, but hot water can further damage already stretched fabrics, to the point where they might just be worthless", "Fair. Didn't even think of tailoring. I guess it would depend on the clothing as well, but I feel like there is quite a few types of clothing that just don't fit well to tailoring.\n\nThe other problem is that it's likely going to be more money spent when OP shouldn't have to spend it to begin with, and frankly, I don't think her mate is going to cover it."]}
