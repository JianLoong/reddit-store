Consider that your coworkers might judge you for your choice though.", "nta but i really want to know why you still work for a company that wouldn't fire an employee that did that to a co-worker and the company.", "NTA but consider telling people that you ARE donating and that you've taken $500 off what he owes you from the investigation. The fact that you aren't pressing charges against him for making false accusations should be enough. Tell them that, not that you just don't want to donate.", "NTA - Even without the bad blood, no one should be expected under any circumstances to participate in any kind of gift to a coworker. If it is important that this be done, it should be the company and not the employees who take the initiative.", "NTA, and that is one expensive card.", "Having cancer doesn't magically make someone a better person \n\nNTA", "NTA may they cope and seethe", "NTA. I wouldn't donate crap to anyone who did me wrong.", "NTA.  Is the coworker with the card aware of the bad blood between you and the sick coworker?", "NTA, fuck that guy.", "NTA.  If you'd signed the card with, say, a picture of a middle finger...or if you'd taken a $20 out when asked to put one one, then maybe.  But even if you had no reason not to, if you could not do so with good conscience and all sincerity, there was no obligation for  you to sign the card nor to donate.  And it sure sounds like you had abundant reason not to want to participate.  Definitely NTA.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t wishing him to die, but you don\u2019t have to pretend to give a fuck about him either.", "NTA.  I don't sign cards for people I don't know, because it just seems hollow. Someone who tried to get me fired? Nah.", "NAH. He took many $1,000s from your family and now you\u2019re supposed to fork over another $20? Fuck right off.", "NTA. You could have written \"hurry back, we miss you!\"", "NTA.  Having cancer does not erase the misery and wrongdoing by this co-worker.

Going out out of your way to make it known you did not contribute would make you the AH", "NTA", "NTA. Though if they bother you again I would say you would probably be well served to remind said person that it should be well known that you're hard up yourself and aren't in any position to donate, and why.", "NTA not at all. They are nuts to think you\u2019d participate.", " NTA", "NTA. You shouldn't be forced do something you don't want to do such as participate in giving donations or sign card for coworker that tried to burn you.

You not signing a get well soon card is ok", "NTA.\n\nYou can always show the coworker how much money you lost and tell that this was your contribution.", "NTA. Totally understandable that you don't want to do this. He made your life very hard. It's not as if you are trying to make his life more difficult, but you don't have to spend money on him and sign cards.", "Tactless, maybe, but NTA. Your coworker is obviously an asshole too, no debate. But if you need this job, consider if moves like this might hurt your standing/reputation at work. Now your boss knows you hold a grudge against your coworker and that might impact you.", "NTA.  You have no obligation to participate.  If he doesn't drop it, scorch his ears off for his presumption.", "Nope. NTA. You already spent enough on him. I had a coworker like this but she was so dumb, her \"allegations\" went no where. When my boss asked me jokingly if I want to collect money for a going away gift I told him I already gathered said gift and pointed to the trash can.\n\nIs there no way you can sue for the money you spent?", "NTA- fair play to you but your coworkers might hate to, start looking for a new job maybe??", "NTA\u2026 this guy is reeping what he sowed.", "NTA ... you would be if you wrote something like \"Or not\"", "Info: did he know the allegations were false? Wasn't the investigation needed to prove one way or the other?", "NTA I'd sign it \"Karma\"", "NTA - we had someone at our work that would get cards for everybody for every little occasion.  It was so annoying.  I might have signed that card with something backhanded actually.  Lol.\n\nWith me at my work the lady had actually got a going-away card to somebody who was leaving for another job somewhere up north.  After this person left it turned out he was actually fired because he was running an e-commerce server off of the servers at work and she had collected 300 and some dollars from everybody.  So yeah I know I won't be participating in any of that nonsense.", "Fundamentally NTA, but you may have made your work situation even less comfortable.  Also, donating handsomely and signing the card would probably make the recipient feel like shit where not signing might go unnoticed by said recipient.  You could have established saintliness instead you\u2019ve shown them bitterness. Ultimately, that will affect you most of all.", "NTA, but you should have signed the card.\n\n\nBecause he and your colleagues would have known that you not only have the capacity for forgiveness and the capability to shrug off an attack like the one he participated in,  but he would feel guilty for the rest of his life. You would live rent free in his head forever. \n\nYou have every right to feel like you do and not sign it, though. \n\nMy 2 cents.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
