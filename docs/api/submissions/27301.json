It's like speaking ill of the dead for some people.\n\nInstead, I'd go to HR and inquire what the policy is about donations/money raising between coworkers. Express that you have been made uncomfortable about not participating and that you would really prefer not to have to justify your financial situation or decisions with your coworkers. Ask if the policy is meant to either be *entirely* opt in with no comment for or against an individual's decision, or that there be a way for it to be anonymous. If the policy is not either of these two options or if they do not have one, ask why this isn't the case.\n\nI've helped run these kinds of money raising before. My move was always to announce the collection's purpose, who it was for, and who my team could approach to give if they desired (usually my fellow assistant service managers and store management). Guilting, pressuring, and gossiping over who gave what was not tolerated, but the way it often ended up going was team members approaching us quietly or privately to give if they so chose and no comment was ever made on the amount.\n\nNo tally was ever made on who gave and who didn't, and the cash was all mixed together in a money pouch and stored in the store safe. We couldn't tell you who gave what even if we wanted to. This system ran pretty well for all eleven years I worked there.\n\nBut yeah, HR will probably want to nip this on the bud. I know a lot of folks say that HR works for the company, and that's true, but this kind of thing just creates needless and petty headaches for them that they'd rather avoid in my experience.", "OP doesn\u2019t have to make up an excuse.

I worked directly with an individual who was the kind of person who needed to 1 up everyone's stories.

He was a chronic liar who would often find a new, outlandish story to explain why he's not showing up to work or showing up late. \n\nSo that one morning, he doesn't show up to work on time (8 am) and we don't hear from him. 10 am rolls around and we start making calls, no response. 11 am, he shows up and doesn't tell anyone he's in (he worked in a location that was away from everyone else). So at some point, I happen to pass by his area and I see him working away on his computer like nothing's amiss and I'm like \"where the heck have you been? We've been trying to locate you for hours, we were even about to get a wellness check done on you!\".\n\nThat's when the most outlandish story he's ever pulled comes out:\n\nHe went to take money out of the bank to pay his rent and he put the 600 bucks in his jacket pocket. He gets to his car and this random guy shows up behind him with a baseball bat and hits him in the head and steals his jacket (he was wearing one of those leather moto jacket that was kinda ratty and absolutely not something someone would steal for value). So he got back home because he was upset about it and didn't know how he would pay his rent and he just went back to bed instead, woke up at 1045 and then made his way to work. \n\nMy first question of course was, did you not call the police? There's a guy on the loose hitting people with a baseball bat (we live in a very safe city so this doesn't happen often), police should know this and by filling a report, they could find him and maybe retrieve your money or bring the guy to justice. His response: \"oh no, I didn't want to go through the trouble\"......so then I ask, you got hit in the head with a baseball bat, did you seek medical help? Go to hospital? (mind you, there was no visible thing showing blunt force trauma to his bald head, no lump, no bruise, no scratches). Oh no, I didn't feel like it, I just needed to go home. \n\nLike WTF right? I did not believe a word of his story based on how crazy it was and the fact that he was a chronic liar. \n\nWell next thing you know, he tells the story to all our co-workers and our bleeding heart, sweetheart of a woman, older coworker who was a \"mom-type\" was all upset by this and started running the idea of all of us pooling our money together to help him cover his rent!

All he has to do is say no to donating and the whole thing will blow over.", "As someone who had childhood cancer, \u201ckarma\u201d is such an incredibly hurtful thing for all the good people who had cancer. There is literature on the subject but thinking karma when something bad happens to someone you don\u2019t like, then it makes it so you start thinking that the bad things that happen because someone did something bad. It makes it harder to have empathy for the people because maybe somehow they deserve it. \n\nI know it\u2019s a joke but it just perpetuates something that causes so much harm.", "OP, please answer the requests for more information about the nature of the coworker's role in the investigation into you.", "Talk about missing the point.  Right over your head, idiot.", "Clearly, you have a problem understanding metaphor.", "I love this!", "I think explaining here, could be worse. It should always be optional on cards or, but especially money.", "Yep, we had to stop all of it at work because people were so damn obnoxious about it and kept score of who gave and who didn't. It was just a whole lot of nastiness and negativity, so the OWNER of the company put an end to all of it.\n\nThe only people sad about it were the gossips who had one less thing to gossip about.", "You\u2019re certainly right to a degree but sometimes there are policies in the company handbook re: soliciting funds from coworkers/clients/etc.\n\nFor example: in my past life (aka 3 years ago) I worked in a small company in hr and a staff member was ill. Some of their coworkers wanted to send a company wide email to solicit funds and announce a meal train.\n\nMy boss said no way, but received some pushback. \n\nShe called the fussy staff member and explained that it\u2019s not because the company doesn\u2019t care but it\u2019s all to do with the sick staff members privacy. \n\nThis proved to be important because the sick person had an extended relative whom they didn\u2019t want to know about their illness. \n\n\n\nSo, yes, OP really should clue in HR on this or at the very least consult their employee handbook to see what the policy is.", "And if they did just investigate them, then OP is an asshole IMO. It would've literally been his job to do that, if that were the case.", "Why would that matter? Ultimately donating to a get well fund is and should be completely voluntary and no one should ever be shamed or made to feel like an asshole for not participating. Especially not someone who has lost thousands of dollars of income in the last year.", "Agreed.  OP should refrain from saying anything negative about the coworker who made the allegations.  But OP should definitely document with HR in case there are additional instances of retaliation.  Hopefully it won't escalate, but helpful to have a paper trail if it does.    \n\n\nAnd even if collections co-worker doesn't know the history, pestering people for money like that is not appropriate in a workplace.  And email saying, \"we're taking up a collection for X, anyone who would like to contribute can see Y by Z date\".  One or 2 reminders to the group are fine.  But the office to office or desk to desk campaign is out of line.  Co-worker shouldn't be asking anyone  why they haven't signed or donated.  \n\n\nAnd documentation should be very neutral and objective.  Sample:  \n\n\nOn \\[date\\], \\[name\\] approached me re: the collection for \\[initial co-worker\\]  I replied I wouldn't be contributing.  Collecting coworker said A and did B.  Go all Joe Friday \"just the facts\".  \n\nDirect quotes of what was said are helpful and direct descriptions of what the co-worker did are useful.", "But he might die!", "What if you need a favour from Ferris someday? Where will you ve then? You heartless wench!", "At one job, they solicited for weddings and births via either an office shower (gifts opened at the shower) or people going door to door, cube to cube, desk to desk trying to get the money.  \n\nThis one woman at a job reproduced with a guy who was an absolute loser and not doing anything to help her emotionally, financially or logistically.  So her co-workers were begging the rest of us to kick in whatever they could  for gifts.  First off, I don't know if she even oked sharing her info like that.  Secondly, I was pretty annoyed when she made a snide social media post a few years later about people about people without kids being irresponsible."]}
