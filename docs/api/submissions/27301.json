It will either create drama you probably don't want, or make you seem petty against a cancer patient. I'm not at all saying that coworker getting cancer retroactively absolves him of his actions, but people get real squirrelly about how cancer patients are treated after diagnosis and coming out publicly. It's like speaking ill of the dead for some people.\n\nInstead, I'd go to HR and inquire what the policy is about donations/money raising between coworkers. Express that you have been made uncomfortable about not participating and that you would really prefer not to have to justify your financial situation or decisions with your coworkers. Ask if the policy is meant to either be *entirely* opt in with no comment for or against an individual's decision, or that there be a way for it to be anonymous. If the policy is not either of these two options or if they do not have one, ask why this isn't the case.\n\nI've helped run these kinds of money raising before. My move was always to announce the collection's purpose, who it was for, and who my team could approach to give if they desired (usually my fellow assistant service managers and store management). Guilting, pressuring, and gossiping over who gave what was not tolerated, but the way it often ended up going was team members approaching us quietly or privately to give if they so chose and no comment was ever made on the amount.\n\nNo tally was ever made on who gave and who didn't, and the cash was all mixed together in a money pouch and stored in the store safe. We couldn't tell you who gave what even if we wanted to. This system ran pretty well for all eleven years I worked there.\n\nBut yeah, HR will probably want to nip this on the bud. I know a lot of folks say that HR works for the company, and that's true, but this kind of thing just creates needless and petty headaches for them that they'd rather avoid in my experience.", "OP doesn\u2019t have to make up an excuse.

It is never fair to put people on the spot, no matter what the circumstances.\n\nI responded to this particular post b/c LOL, I remember management having to step in at one place I worked when someone started going round with a card (at least no money request!) for a colleague's kid (kid didn't work there) to congratulate kid on passing their driving test. Cards for - well, just about everything in colleagues' lives - were well out of hand well before that, and yes, I was THAT person who used to politely decline to sign (let alone donate) if it was someone I didn't know, **and** the miserable cow who refused to join the \"birthday club\" - I was fine with not receiving a gift in exchange for not having to contribute to up to 20 others every year :/\n\nAnother place I worked managed it really well - organiser would put card, money envelope etc in a big brown envelope and attach the office phone list to the front. When the envelope came to you, cross your name off, with or without signing/donating, pass to someone else not crossed off (or back to organiser if end of work day for them to start over next day), no muss, no fuss, no pressure.
