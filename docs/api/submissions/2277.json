Yeah, I'm an adult and can entertain myself, but it bugs me that my birthday isn't important enough to even send a text on, but she makes a production about everyone else (her deadbeat cousins for starters). So, I started booking a condo on the beach in the town my dad's brother lives in.  My auntie and cousins have a dinner with cake, they make the time for my day, and I'm at the beach with people that want to be around me.  My mom demanded that I no longer travel on my birthday because she \"might\" stay home next year.

It's never obligatory for family to spend time together on holidays. If people want to come, they should come.
