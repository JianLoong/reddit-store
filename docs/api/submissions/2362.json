Before that I was 15 and he stopped by unannounced. I don't use social media so it was difficult but I found his fb page after the discussion with his wife about not attending because I wanted to reach out to him personally to decline it but I don't have any of his contact info, it all was through his wife. I changed my mind about reaching out after I saw some religious toned hateful things he'd share and say. They also attended anti LGBT rallies and had pics public. Please keep in mind they're all strangers to me and the limited info I could get was news to me that came after I declined. No, I'm not sure they'd be that way in person,I don't know them, but I have no interest in finding that out. \n\n\nPost:\n\nI haven't met my dad more than a handful of times. We don't even communicate yearly but we try to keep it pleasant. \nI'm 34 now, my son's 15. He met him once when he was 2. \nDad's remarried and decided to have me and my son, my sister brother in law and their daughter over for the holidays. They paid for the ticket and using his new brother in laws air bnb nearby. They're all rich. It's across the country. \n\nIt's really for the kids to celebrate we aren't exchanging any gifts except for the kids, but I asked that they didn't get too crazy with the gifts so we don't need to check bags on the way back. My dad's wife replied back saying she was actually not going to get any of the adults anything and that includes my son. I was taken aback but she said he's already fully grown and this is for the younger kids (the rest are under 10) and it's immature that he'd still celebrate with the babies. \n\nI'm offended and I think it would hurt his feelings a lot to be left out from his cousins like that. I figured I'd just bring something for him to open but like I mentioned, there rich. They're getting the kids all these expensive neat gifts. I have $13 in my bank account rn I'm not even sure I can afford gas this week. \nSo I decided it's best not to go. \nThey're livid at me because they've already spent so much and they can't get a refund on the tickets. I do feel bad but I'm not putting my son in that position. Furthermore they're very religious and would absolutely be vocal about their feelings about LGBT which my son is also. I just don't think it's worth tip toeing around them for. He's missed every Xmas what's another one. \nMy sister's upset to have to go alone though, and my dad and his wife are completely up in arms saying I'm selfishly demanding things when they've already done so much. \nAITA for refusing the trip?", "created_utc": 1668497937, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yvq72r/aita_for_refusing_trip_i_didnt_pay_for/", "score": 167, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like one toxic and controlling environment you would be walking into. No matter how old you are, you always celebrate and appreciate a good gift so her argument is slightly flawed there. \n\nThe way they are suddenly showing an interest and making you all fly to them, when they could just visit you makes me very suspicious. Good on you for supporting your son, he doesn\u2019t need to be around people who would make him feel uncomfortable with their beliefs. Definitely not the arsehole and the way they are responding - TATA", "Bring your son to his grandads- who has only ever met him once- for Christmas so he can watch all of his cousins be spoiled with gifts whilst he just sits there.

In what world is 15 considered \u201cfully grown\u201d? There\u2019s no doubt about it that he\u2019d feel pretty ostracized and left out if all of his cousins had presents to open besides him. That\u2019s just a shitty situation to put a KID in. \n\nI don\u2019t want to make heavy accusations here either, but the whole deal with them being religious and your son belonging to the LGBT community is\u2026 less than ideal to put it as light as possible. Do you think that\u2019s the real reasoning behind not wanting to buy him gifts?\n\nEither way, I think you\u2019re being a great mother for refusing to bring your child to an environment in which he could and more than likely would be uncomfortable. Enjoy a nice holiday how you normally do and try not to sweat it. Your family can be upset all they want\u2014 but you are just looking out for your child.", "NTA\n\nGood on you for standing up for your son!

The exclusion from being treated like the other kids (I assume other grandkids) is harsh enough, but them also being anti LGBT is the final nail. Your kid doesn't need that nastiness in his life.", "NTA. If they weren\u2019t actually going to give anything to your son. Sounds like they\u2019ve done nothing for him his whole childhood and now that he\u2019s old they don\u2019t feel like they have to.", "You shouldn't go!

Stand by your boundaries and don't subject your son to a shitty time just so your dad can make himself feel better about being absent in your childhood. You don't owe him anything.", "NTA protect your child from these people. You are not wasting their money, they are wasting it through exclusion on multiple levels.", "NTA, if they are hell bent on an explanation tell them that you won't be putting your son into a situation where he feels treated like he is less than his cousins just because he is a couple of years older. \nBeing a grandparent your father is really being an A-hole to make a distinction between your son and his other grandchildren, especially given the fact he hasn't showed up for the past 13 years in his grandson's and your life. \n\nAnd they decided to pay for all the travel expenses, yo didn't ask them to if I understand that your family dynamics are more of a 'hey I'm your dad and should show up once every decade to show you how rich I am and how much I (don't) care about my daughters and their kids'.\n\nAlso huge red flag if you find homophobic comments from your dad's hand on social media. Most religious people keep these opinions to themselves because they're civil enough to realoze it's their personal opinion and they can't force others to live the same lifestyle they commit to. But once such people go rant about it on social media initiated by themselves, it's not something you want your LGBT kid around.", "NTA. At 15, he's still a kid. It would be awful for him to be the only cousin not getting a gift. That's terrible! Plus the crappy religious attitude after being a dead beat dad & being a bigot. That's the worst. I wouldn't go either!", "ESH. Them for excluding your son when he would have been the only one who didn\u2019t fit their criteria for what a kid deserving Xmas gifts should be. You for considering going even though they were homophobic (assuming you knew this about them before the gift-related information was revealed). You shouldn\u2019t expose your young, impressionable child to people (even family) who would treat him as less than for any reason.", "INFO: You state they're completely up in arms saying you're selfishly demanding things. What are they referring to that you're demanding? A gift for your son?\n\nAre you really sure they'd be vocal about their feelings toward LGBT people in front of your son? Although some very religious people may have been taught that homosexuality is a sin, they don't all necessarily insult people to their faces about it.", "But they already gave a huge gift to you all; planetickets and a room in a b&b.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're the parent and have every right to keep you and your family away from a toxic situation. I wouldn't call you an asshole, but I am a little concerned if you knew that your son was part of the LGBTQ+ community, and agreed to go anyway. You don't love me and my family, I can't hang out with you. \n\nI honestly don't know if their wealth has much to do with this conversation.  I'm curious if they arranged and paid for all of this without telling you. I can see people like this doing that. It does come across as \"they're rich so I should get stuff\" vibes which isn't that relevant. The core issues is the concern that your family will reject your child and that your parents clearly seem to be showing favoritism towards your siblings kids.", "NTA.  If your dad wants to stroke his ego, you are not obligated to cooperate with him.  It would be awkward to travel without your teenage son.  But it would be even more awkward for your teenage son to go.  I think you made the right decision.", "Info: how old are the other kids? \n\nEither way, NTA. honestly, good for you for sticking up for your son. Children often get told that their feelings and boundaries are irrelevant and they need to \u201crespect their elders\u201d even if their elders are treating them unfairly or judging them and making hateful comments. Good for you showing your son that his feelings are important. Your son\u2019s dignity and feelings are more important than some old AH\u2019s bruised ego. You\u2019re teaching your son values that your dad and his wife never learned. \n\nMy family does something similar for Christmas: all kids get a bunch of gifts from everyone. But it\u2019s also very well addressed that this no longer happens once you reach 18. There\u2019s no disappointment because the age limit is very well announced and understood. Your son would not understand why he wasn\u2019t being treated like the other kids because he is, in fact, still a kid.", "NTA and why would you snub ANY of your children?  You wouldn't.  That STEPmom told you what SHE was doing, and told you that your child doesn't DESERVE to celebrate with his family, yeah FUCK THAT NOISE.  I hope you and your little family have THE best time celebrating like serving folks at the homeless kitchen/church fellowship meals/etc.  When my kids were small, they thought that bitching about what they didn't get would net them more.  It did.  It netted THEM service to OTHERS during EVERY holiday.  Ya know who didn't bitch anymore about what they DIDN'T get?", "NTA. You gotta do right for your child.

What much exactly, paid the tickets for you and your kid to meet homophobic douchebags? That doesn't sound like help honestly.", "You don't even have his direct contact info and he expects you to make a long trip for Christmas and put your son in a difficult position too? These people are strangers, not family. You might even end up stranded there if you go. The effort to reach out should come from him, not from you. You don't owe this man nor his wife nothing.

I don't even want to test the waters on it tbh.

The last time I even saw my dad was when my son was 2 he passed through town and we went to IHOP and that was it. Before that I was 15 and he came over to say hi unannounced. That was the first time I had seen my parents in the same place at the same time. I haven't met any of the people he's married into.

It's kind of seriously messed up on so many levels.", "Well I don't really know them. I've only seen my dad in person a hand full of times if that and he was mostly that judgemental. I don't use social media but found he had a FB where he posted a lot of very hateful things. No I'm not sure. But I'm sure I'd rather not find out the hard way.\n\nBut she was talking about the gift.
