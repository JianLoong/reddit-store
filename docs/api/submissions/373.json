I'm the third of four children, (33m, 31f, 29f and 20f). My brother is their golden child since, as a man, they expected him to grow up, have a good career, and support my parents. It never happened, and my brother became a terrible guy as a result. My mother adores my older sister because she is gorgeous, has lighter skin, and green eyes, she's a horrible person. \nMy parents arranged for her to marry a wealthy man. My younger sister is someone I don't know much about. I've never paid much attention to her, and moved away as soon as I graduated from high school. That's exactly what my she did as well. We don't have much contact. \n\nIn terms of academic achievement, I have outperformed my older brother and sister. I have a good job and I'm married to a great, accomplished man. My job is something I enjoy doing, it pays well and I work with wonderful people. I love my husband, he\u2019s a wonderful man though my parent dislike him probably because, My husband is of African-American descent. \nThey have treated him poorly, making passive aggressive comments and even calling him a slur behind his back on several occasions. \nHe did absolutely nothing wrong.\nThey chose not to attend our wedding. My grandparents and younger sister were the only members of my family who attended the wedding. I've done everything to show my parents how wonderful my husband is. \nI just wanted them to try to get to know my husband.\n On May 29, 2022, we had our first child, a daughter. I offered to pay my mother to be there for me during her birth and to stay with us for at least two weeks. She turned down every offer. I texted them about her birth, but they never reply. My daughter has nothing to do with whatever I did to them to upset them. Why treat her like this when she's innocent? She deserves loving grandparents from her mother's side. It's such an awful feeling to know that my mum did everything for my older sister when she was pregnant and will not do the same for me.\n\nMy younger sister called me exactly a week ago to inform me that my parents are in serious debt. Almost a million dollars. They are on the point of losing their home. My sister's spouse is no longer willing to help my parents. My younger sister claims that my brother is to blame for their current financial situation. \nWe both have no idea how someone could accumulate such a massive debt.\nIt's put me in such a dilemma. I want to help them, but it doesn't feel right, especially after the way my husband and daughter were treated. It makes me feel as if I'm dismissing their behavior. On the other hand, I can't let my parents drown in debt. Regardless of how badly they treat me or how much they resent me. My parents are still my parents. My family needs my support. I'm overwhelmed by all of this. I haven't told my husband yet since I don't want to involve him in my family's issues.

Your husband deserves to be treated with respect, if you give them money you are disrespecting both him and your daughter. Not to mention taking money from your daughter, and any future children you may have. This is not your problem at all, keep your money for your family ie, your HUSBAND AND DAUGHTER", "NTA and please don\u2019t help them. There\u2019s probably a reason your sister\u2019s spouse stopped helping. They sound awful", ">I can't let my parents drown in debt.\n\nUm, yes. Yes, you can. They let you know in as many ways as they could that they didn't consider you their daughter.\n\nFurther, they haven't even contacted you themselves to ask for help.\n\nSo sit down with your husband to figure out how much you would have given them in rescue cash. Turn around and instead give that cash to a worthy cause that fights poverty. If your sister contacts you again, say that your parents haven't contacted you yet. If your parents contact you, tell them that you have given the money you would have given them to ... whatever cause that is. They can't accuse you of being selfish. And the actual beneficiaries of your generosity will deserve it far more than your parents would.\n\nHuge, huge NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour parents haven't asked you directly for help. These people essentially have refused to acknowledge your daughter, are pig ignorant to your husband and have treated you as a lesser child all your life, any money or help you give them will not make them better people or treat you and your family any better. To help them in any way would be to take the food out of your young family's mouth to feed people who backed the wrong horse - your brother. Don't do it.", "NTA.\n\nI feel like we've seen similar posts before, even down to the $1M debt, but I'll just say what I said then -- there's a good chance that trying to bail them out of such a large debt is just throwing good money after bad.\n\nAnd, I mean, are you really gonna help out the folks who couldn't be bothered to come to your wedding or meet your child?", "I suspect there are significant cultural differences here.  But I don\u2019t see you having any obligation to help them.  They can sell the house and move to an affordable arrangement.\n\n NTA.", "NTA if they wouldn't even bother to attend your wedding nor see their grandchild, you have no obligation towards them since they didn't met their obligations as parents", "WNBTA - why would you help them when they clearly want nothing to do with you? They haven't even asked for your help, you only hearing about this through the grapevine. Honestly I think it would make you TA to your husband if you did anything to help them. Especially if you don't talk to him about it first. \n\nAlso if they are so unkind to your husband because of his race what makes you think they would treat your child any better being a mixed race? Do yourself a favor and just cut them out of your life. Nobody needs that level of toxic in their life.", "NTA and with how poorly they have treated you and your family I can\u2019t imagine why you\u2019d help them.  Use the money for your family and your daughters future education but don\u2019t feel in any way obligated to help them. Your mother was awful to you when you needed her and they\u2019re racist.  I\u2019d be NC with them.", "NTA. Unless you have a good chunk of money saved up that you AND your husband are willing to risk never seeing again, stay out of this problem.\n\nLet your parents and their golden child figure it out.\n\nThere's no way I'm rushing to assist someone who's never been there for me or my family. I wonder if your sister reached out to you because your parents know you'll probably be unwilling to help.", "Nta now but that could change if you do decide to help them. Every time you think about helping them you should put money into trust fund and/or scholarship for your child?(and any future kids)", "NTA, \n\nIt should not be your responsibility (or any of your siblings)  to give that kind of money or help to your parents. \n\nAnd, your parents have not supported you, your marriage,  your child, and have gone so far as to express  racist thoughts/feelings about your spouse. \n\nPlease do not take on this burden \u2014 it is not yours to carry, this is their mess & they need to handle it. You are not \"letting\" your parents drown in debt, you didn't do this to them, they have done it themselves.  \n\nYou should be there to emotionally support your family, this is a hard thing. But don't financially support them...", "NTA. however, you ***MUST*** discuss this issue in full with your husband right away. Shared finances, he deserves to know you are even contemplating doing this. \n\nNTA if you do not support your parents, too. They are obviously racist AH and you need to stay away from them. \n\nAnd finally, why do you implicitly believe what your younger sister is telling you about your parents' situation and its causes? You say you have little to do with her. She claims her family has been assisting your parents and now wants you to take over. This is very shady and unlikely. So if you are just going on what she has told you, you need to think again. \n\nBesides all that, your older sister married to Mr. Wealthy is clearly in better shape to take this burden on. Your parents clearly favor her, and have already basically cut you off. \n\nSo really to get back to your question: there is no reason in a sane world why you would assist your parents and every reason for you to stay away from them and their problems. If they have gotten themselves into this mess, then they have the responsibility to find their own way out.", "YWNBTA. Please don't help them. They sound like they've been nothing but awful to you, your husband AND your daughter. They have indulged your brother by the sounds of things and this is the result of that. You could damage your relationship with your husband over this and they're not worth it. It might sound callous but they've done nothing for you, don't let them take from you now because of their horrible decisions.", "NTA if you do not help them. It sounds like this is your brother, the favorite child\u2019s problem in part. He\u2019s the one who should dig them out of debt since he dug the hole.  \n\nFamilies help each other emotionally, mentally and sometimes financially. It goes two ways. Unfortunately your parents have decided through their actions that you are not their family.  Do not feel guilty about their choice.", "NTA, but you will be asshole if you help them. Your parents are adults. All adults are responsible for their behavior. If you were 1 mil in debt, would you demand your kid pay for your mistakes or your other kids mistakes. No, you wouldn't. Let your parents deal with their consequences. Also you will the asshole if you don't tell your husband and put your household finances is jeopardy for \"parents\" that gave a flying f*ck about you. Put that 1mil dollars for your kid's education.", "YWBTA if you helped them.  You would take away from your husbands and daughters financial future to help them?  Helping them would basically condone their treatment if the people you love.  And I would certainly not help someone who was racist.", "WNBTA. Your parents have systematically rejected you, your husband and your child. It is not like they have behaved very much as a family to you, have they? They favoured the one who put them in this precarious position and the other one who is unable/unwilling to help them anymore. Not only would they not attend your wedding, they haven't even met your daughter and treat your husband with contempt. Don't feel forced to help them, because they haven't even asked for it. Better yet, don't do it. They don't deserve it. They may be your \"family\", but certainly, they have not been one for you.", "YWNBTA. They've indulged a golden child and scapegoat dynamic with their children that to say has not paid off is an understatement. Their interest in your life has at best been not showing any and at worst being racist to your partner. Don't do anything. Their problems are of their own making and they can use the resources they haven't alienated or abused to help them.", "NTA. You do not owe them a damn thing.", "NTA if you don't help them.  You should tell your husband if you're going to do any financial help, especially on this scale. \n\nI don't know if you're Desi, but my husband and I are a Black/Desi couple and my in-laws were really awful when we were getting married.

You'd still be within your right not to help them as one million dollars is a lot of money and it seems they have allowed your brother to put them in a very unfortunate situation.\n\nNone of that is your problem. I repeat: Not. Your. Problem. It might sound cold but you need to look out for yourself, your spouse and your child first and foremost. Your old family decided they did not want to have a relationship with you and your new family, in spite of multiple efforts you have made to include them. Thus, they're not really part of your family anymore. They had their chance. They're still related to you, of course, but family runs deeper than blood.\n\nPlease, don't feel any guilt for deciding not to help them. They don't deserve it. I would focus on your marriage and your baby. They, along with your happiness, are what's most important.", "Yes, THIS. NTA and do not help these awful people out. They do not deserve you supporting or respect.", "And paying doesn't stop you from being a scapegoat.\n\nNotice your parents didn't even tell you themselves that they are a million dollars in debt? At least they're consistent lol", "BIL sees that even with his and his wife's help the parents are still $1 million in debt. It has done no good. Can OP clear up that much debt. Doubt it.", "A charity that supports POC in particular I reckon", "Plus do not keep this from your husband.   He needs to know what's going on.", "Bailing them out is patching a hole. The cause hasn't changed and won't until they want to change. If they don't want to change this will happen again.", "Agreed.\n\n$1,000,000 is very difficult to dig out of.\n\nUnless they are making massive fundamental financial changes, no matter how much financial help you provide, the money will be wasted.\n\nThey need to fix their whole situation and reason they are in debt before anyone helps them.", "You are right-this is a duplicate of a post a couple weeks ago with the added detail of the African American husband.", "This is definitely a repost", "The main advantage of my suggestion is that it takes the high road. Focusing on POC for the purpose of getting to the parents would diminish that."]}
