I am not married, no kids, but I want to be a wife and mom one day.  Dating is not just not easy for me.  \n\nRecently, I (30sF) decided to get my first tattoo.  It's a big piece that covers my upper arm and I am in love with it.  This is something I've wanted for years.  My parents are not happy with it.  Where they are from, only criminals get tattoos.  Not the daughters of hardworking immigrants who go to church every Sunday.  \n\nI was at their home for dinner last week when my mom complained that I'm going to be a spinster because no man will want me for my tattoo.  I've been a spinster for thirty years at this point, so obviously tattoos aren't the problem here.  \n\nShe deadass asked me I can get a man when I have tattoos.  And I smartass replied, \"what do you think I'm trying to do?  I want a guy who love me for me.\"\n\nLong story short, dinner ended early and Mom doesn't want to have anything to do with me because I am disrespectful.  I am still on good terms with my dad, though.  While he is in my corner he asked me to consider her point of view.  Dad says Mom is worried that I won't be able to find someone and settle down and that my tattoo will block me from that.  Tattoos are still pretty taboo in our culture.  And she's facing more pressure now that their friends' kids are settling down and having kids and her's isn't.  \n\nGuys, Texan culture is conservative.  Asian-Texan culture even more so.  \n\nI feel like my comeback was great.  But after what my dad said, I'm doubting myself.  When I asked my Asian friends for their perspective, reactions' been mixed.

I promise, you are not a spinster. You have an entire, full life and finding someone to share it with shouldn\u2019t feel like a ticking time clock. You are not on your mom\u2019s timeline or her friend\u2019s kid\u2019s timeline (the fact that I even had to write this makes me roll my eyes.) Make sure you\u2019re using language with yourself that you would use if your friend said this to you.  I\u2019m not Asian, but I am from the Southern US, and there\u2019s an entire culture around getting married early. If you were in NY, you\u2019d be a baby still! \n\nFamily culture is hard to overcome but you\u2019re breaking some generational beliefs just by being who you are. Good luck!", "NTA. I was raised in a very traditional family and I also have a tattoo. My parents were concerned that I won\u2019t get a good job because I have a tattoo. This indeed could be the case at the time I had it (14 years ago) however times changed and I worked for multiple great companies where people had huge tattoos (mine is extremely small) \n\nNow speaking about the cultural issue. \nThe fact that you went ahead and did a tattoo because it was your dream, though you knew it won\u2019t be accepted by your ethnicity and location says that you\u2019re moving different direction. Traditions are important - this is how modern civilization was established. But as someone who has masters in cultural studies I can tell you that this is absolutely normal. Culture tends to change with the time, there are always people who do something that was forbidden before and after certain amount of time it becomes normal. You\u2019re good, everything is gonna be ok. I believe you should talk to your mom and explain her that you respect your roots but with the time things tend to change. What was banned before can become normal afterwards. \n\nBest of luck finding your love and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be ok.", "NTA. I have tattoos and will be marrying my wonderful girlfriend in due course.", "NTA. \n\nBefore we continue, I\u2019ll state very clearly that I\u2019m a New York City liberal white girl\u2026but I have family in the Bible Belt. I also have a series of tattoos on my left wrist that are crazy meaningful to me, and can easily be covered with my watch. \n\nBottom line - the right person is going to think the sun shines out of your ass, no matter how you decorate your body. Tattoos will only help you weed out the losers a little faster.", "NTA. You are 30, and it's your body. Plus, you don't have to buy into any cultural norm you don't approve of.", "NTA. Tattoos aren't going to prevent you from finding someone. If anything, it'll help you find someone with a more open mind than your mother.", "Okay, I\u2019m not Asian, nor do I live in Texas, but both of my arms are sleeved and my back is mostly covered, and I have a tattoo on the back of my neck. \n\nI am happily married with three amazing kids. My husband also has a lot of tattoos plus a lot of ear piercings. He makes six figures in an executive role at an ad agency. \n\nA couple of years ago I was elected to public office. While I wore long sleeves when the weather or occasion called for it, I never made myself uncomfortable to hide my tattoos. I wanted people to vote for me, and my tattoos are a part of me. And people DID vote for me. Because they believed in my vision, intelligence, and values. \n\nSome of the clients at my husband\u2019s agency are VERY conservative. And they LOVE my husband. Not because he agrees with their positions but because he\u2019s so good at what he does. They request he lead their projects because he\u2019s talented, wicked smart, and hardworking. \n\nTattoos, because they are a form of self-expression, ARE a part of who you are. But they do not define who you are. \n\nWhen I started getting tattoos, my mom really disliked them. Made comments about them a lot, implying I\u2019d never find a job, that they\u2019re expensive and painful to remove, etc., etc. Then one day, I asked her if she loved me less because I have tattoos. She was taken aback and said, \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d I asked her if she thought they made me a bad person. She tried to say something about what other people might think, but I interrupted her and asked again, \u201cDo YOU think they make me a bad person? Do they change what YOU think about my character?\u201d She paused and said \u201cno.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, then drop it please.\u201d And she did. \n\n(A couple of years later, we took a trip to Mexico, and my mom had a couple of margaritas and got a little henna tattoo on her arm. When I saw it, she tipsily said, \u201cI\u2019m just like you now!\u201d It was adorable.)\n\nTLDR: Most people don\u2019t care about tattoos. Even a lot of conservative people don\u2019t care once they see what an amazing person you are. And trust me when I say you want a husband who loves you for YOU. If a tattoo would make a man not want to be with you, then be grateful for that tattoo, because it just filtered out a garbage guy for you.", "NTA.  It's your body and while I'm not from your culture, I don't see how what you said was disrespectful at all.  Your mom seems genuinely worried and cares about you, but this business of her getting \"pressure\" over YOUR marital status is ridiculous and she should rise above.  Using culture as an excuse to not be supportive of your kids is BS.  Just because your culture holds certain beliefs doesn't mean you're not responsible for them too if you go along.\n\nI was also raised in a culture where tattoos are taboo (Orthodox Judaism) but you know what?  I made up my own mind about things and created my own life.  Cultural beliefs aren't mandatory.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour mom is a controlling AH - you are right to set boundaries. And a tatoo (unless it is on the face) will not keep you from finding a partner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome actually LIKE them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd spend less time with your parents - you won't find a partner THERE. But getting them out of tyour mind WILL help.", "My daughter is in her 30's and has tats and isn't married. Is she happy? That's all I care about.  Unfortunately even mom's have peer pressure. Just tell her you're happy.", "You'll find someone that will be sleeved out then you can say see mom got one", "You're 30 years old. It's high time to stop seeing your mother as \"mom\". She's not your boss. She's just another adult. And in this case, she was the more offensive one *by far*. Stop letting her be rude to you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - but culturally the reply was rude. That said, culturally acceptable reactions and expectations can be wrong. So yeah, you are fine", "Unfortunately, my friend, the answer is the same one I've been giving every other lady friend I've spoken with lately, no matter their ethnicity.\n\nGet out of Texas.\n\nETA  Judgement: NTA"]}
