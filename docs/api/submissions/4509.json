We booked in advance. Told them about it, let them know they could come, or not. We planned on bringing our computers to have a LAN party while we were there (my boyfriend and I game together) once a few people wanted to go. We were really excited.\n\nRecently I learned as we arrived at someone's house to watch a game together as a group, that I am not \"invited on the trip any longer\", because one of his friend's girlfriends couldn't come due to work, and now it's going to be a \"guy's trip\".\n\nI feel pretty hurt. I got upset and asked them what right they had to disinvite me from a trip that I planned, and to basically make it \"no women allowed\" for some odd reason (we plan things all the time and I attend; we share the same interests a lot of the time so I am confused and bothered by the implication that I'd be distracting/in the way/make it less fun). They brushed it off. So they are going now, without me or anyone else with a vagina, I guess.\n\nMy boyfriend feels torn. He is kind of a people-pleaser and doesn't want to make waves. His friends say weird shit sometimes about women (and say they are joking) but this makes me feel like they actually meant those things, and don't even think of me as a friend (straw/back situation as some other things have happened that were similar but I brushed it off as my misunderstanding, at the time). Instead of also being their friend, I'm just their friend's girlfriend, which really hurts because I've really been there for a lot of these guys and gone out of my way for them (ex. one of them projectile-vomited in a bathroom at a friend's house everywhere, and got embarrassed and didn't know how to clean it while drunk, so I cleaned it up for them). I have hosted at my house and always tried to make it fun. I don't understand.\n\nI told them it was fucked up and I planned the trip, so they don't get to decide that. They basically acted like I was being emotional and just needed to get over it. I have refused to talk to some of them since then. \n\nEveryone is acting like I don't want them to go and do things \"just the guys\" and I am being controlling. The narrative has been lost among our friends and I am being painted as a villain compared to other women who were going, who are \"cool with it\".\n\nWhen actually, I don't give a shit (they go out all the time for \"guy's nights\" and guy's trips), I just want to enjoy the trip I planned, regardless of being a girl, or not. \n\nI don't think telling them I'm coming anyway would even do anything; I can't imagine going now, with how they clearly feel. That would be really awkward probably. But it has created a rift between my dude and his friends and they are telling him I'm being unreasonable and overreacting, and he is talking about not going and is really pissed at them but doesn't want to ruin the friend group dynamic.\n\nI know I can just plan something else, but this sucks.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670797632, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zjc9xr/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_disinvited_from_a_trip/", "score": 300, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The misogynistic clowns can all go have a nice incel circle jerk in hell. Ditch the so-called friends who won't hear your side. Make new friends, actual friends and have an epic trip with them. Who knows, you might find someone better than Mr. Spineless.", "NTA \nAre the reservations in your name? Cancel them or still go and invite your friends instead.", "NTA - cancel anything that has your name on it.  You do not what to be financially responsible for what these guys do. \n\nSounds like your boyfriend needs to choose - you or his a-hole friends.  The only redeemable thing he can do at this point is cut them off.", "NTA. This exact thing happened to me once. \nI planned a trip to Chicago with my bf. Told his friends, they made the exact dates a \u201cguys trip\u201d and I was uninvited from MY OWN TRIP. \n\nNothing about it is okay. My partner realized it before I could say anything and didn\u2019t go.", "Cancel the trip. When they get upset you can throw that why you so emotional shit in their faces. Fuck em lol if your bf doesn't stand up for you or grow a damn spine it's time to lose the extra weight and move on. \n\nNTA", "NTA. If you booked it all, you can cancel it all.  Plan a trip for just you and your bf instead.  He needs better friends, they are AH's.  I'd be pretty disappointed with him if he went on this trip after the way they are treating you.  Just because one gf can't go doesn't mean you should be uninvited, they are being incredibly rude.", "You might want to show your boyfriend this post, he may get where you are coming from", "NTA-  It's good your boyfriend is upset with them but he needs to be prepared for them to dump him because they're bad friends and they seem like bad people in general. If you can, unbook the trip.", "Cancel the trip. Book a nice holiday for yourself at a resort. Let the \u201cboys\u201d fend for themselves. Or if you want to be petty-rebook their trip for a sketchy motel.", "I wouldn't date a guy that signed off on that behavior, begrudgingly or not. You're dating a misogynistic jellyfish.", "NTA. Cancel your booking and never plan anything again for these sexist pigs.", "NTA and cancel that shit. You and your bf planned this so if you can't go then cancel and tell your bf that his behavior as a people pleaser is harming the relationship and might ha4m future stuff too.", "NTA.\n\nYou've booked the trip, and as they have changed what they want the trip to be, you can too - turn it in to a girls or a whatever trip, and tell them they can book their own, instead of hijacking yours, and if they complain tell them they just \"need to get over it\". You say your boyfriend is a people - pleaser, not that it is a good thing, but why does it only seem to be with other people and not you?", "NTA your bf is.  He should either stick up for you or tell the friends to beat it.  It was a come if you want to invite and no harm in taking that invite back.  If you put in any money at all for it demand for it back.", "I would cancel anything booked and then rebook a solo journey to someplace great!\nNTA...but these \"gentlemen\" certainly are!", "NTA. And you might want to consider finding some new friends, and possibly a new boyfriend. If he can't step in and step up for you in this situation, what's he going to do when some serious shit starts flying?\n\nFuck the group dynamic, and fuck the friends. They've established that they'll happily do it to you.", "OP please update us on this!", "NTA. Cancel the trip for them and you go instead. Take your boyfriend, but his friends can kick rocks. If you\u2019re the one who made the effort to plan and book the trip, then you should get to enjoy it.", "You might want to show your boyfriend this post, he may get where you are coming from", "NTA, but don\u2019t burn down your life over it lol\n\nSo much of this advice is given by people who would never turn their own life upside down like they recommend you do.\n\nAll that said, obviously that group aren\u2019t your friends, they are his friends. There is no reason to force yourself into this trip with them when they obviously don\u2019t appreciate you. You\u2019ve ignored a fair few red flags until now, I\u2019d take the time invested into organising the trip as the price of cementing that fact.\n\nHave a frank and mature conversation with the BF as well. You are probably going to have to find new friends as well. This is a positive thing, because you didn\u2019t lose any friends, you just finally realised they never were in the first place. While he is hanging out with those immature douch bags, see whether there are any groups of people that share your interests. People are often a combination of the people they spend the most time around, so if you think they are having a negative influence on him and you really love him, communicate to give him a chance to grow, but if you force him away from hia friends he might resent you, while if he realises his friends and creating the distance between you both he might become more conscious of their behaviour.\n\nBasically, this trip is a symptom of a greater problem. Don\u2019t throw it all away immediately, because no one is perfect, but if communication fails then you can\u2019t keep ignoring the red flags", "You planned it for you and your BF, with other friends welcome. Still go with the original plan, the real original plan. Tell everyone else that due to their behavior, you are going back to it being just the two of you. If your BF doesn't like it, Jane a nice solo ski trip, or make it a girl's trip. Then maybe look around and find a better class of boyfriend, who has a better class of friends.\n\nAs someone with a penis, I don't understand the \"we don't want women around\" thing. I know a lot of guys like that, and have no interest in hanging out with them.", "NTA\n\nTurn this into a trip for you and your man. ONLY. No one else is allowed. You did the planning and made the arrangements. Just tailor them for a date trip instead!", "NTA... you have a boyfriend problem. If he was a decent partner he would have stopped this ignorance immediately.  \"It was her idea, of course she is coming... you are welcome home to decline our invitation if you dont want to come....\"", "NTA, I would cancel anything that you booked and make them have to plan the whole thing themselves. They don't get to shut you out AND benefit from your labor. Also, your boyfriend is being a super shitty boyfriend.", "NTA and cancel EVERYTHING at this point. They are TRASH. Find a boyfriend with a spine. Then rebook a trip with people who care about you. If it is a so trip, so be it.", "NTA", "They are not your friends. They view you as a woman whose job it is to service them.\n\nWhen guys make sexist jokes they are testing the water. 1. Does this guy let me get away with this and a. Does that mean he already agrees with me or b. Can be coerced into agreeing with me. And 2. Does this woman fear standing up to me and how far can I push her.\n\nGet away from them.

Gross", "NTA cancel all the bookings and let them plan their own trip.", "NTA! It's quite literally the trip that you booked, planned, and organized. I'd be so mad and that would be the last time I hung out with those 'friends'. Furthermore, I'd cancel the things I booked and tell them if they want their guys trip then they can figure it out on their own.", "nta cancel the trip ... dont tell them until its closer to the time dont tell them the itinery of the trip if they want a trip without you .... they can organise it them selves", "Take your plans and go. Ask the girls if they want to join you or your boyfriend, then go. \n\nNothing ruins a guys weekend than knowing the girls are nearby and having more fun.", "If bf is a people pleaser, why doesn\u2019t he try to please you?\n\nYou planned it and he stood by and let you get kicked from it?\n\nDo you have stuff\u2026reservations, tickets, whatnot, that you can cancel?\n\nNTA", "This. OP, let them know you'll cancel the trip for men and women, and they can plan a trip for all the people with penises.

Let them plan their totally cool brotacular trip together! You planned everything and without you going you cannot ensure they would have every leg of the trip run smoothly so you\u2019re stepping out of the role. Also, all the other people who are like, \u201cI\u2019d totally be cool with it.\u201d, would in fact, not be cool with it when put in your shoes.
