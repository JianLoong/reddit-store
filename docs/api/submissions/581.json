Like a clown car, there's a lot of folks here!\n\nI'm sorry that you had an argument about your body with your mother. A smaller couch sounds like a more useful piece of furniture for a small room with the guy and his mom. While she's on the bed, he can sit and watch  tv or browse his phone without disturbing her. Two beds in a small room doesn't make much sense, and this allows him his own little space in the room. \n\nSurely he can say if the couch is uncomfortable. \\\\\n\nWas the purpose of this post the bed/couch fight, or your personal argument with your mom?", "NTA- all you\u2019re doing is suggesting a bed instead of a couch.
