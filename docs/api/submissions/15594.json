Basically, my heart will randomly pound really hard once and it leaves me gasping for air, before all goes back to normal. It's scary, happens at least once a week and again, we have no idea what's causing it. \n\nMy daughter (20) lives at home currently and is understandably scared for my well being. She has been to every appointment with me and usually is the one who slams her foot down to make them run tests. Now, will I appreciate everything my daughter is doing to advocate for me, she's taken it a step too far. She came home with a medical service dog last week and presented it as a \"gift\" and said it gave her some piece of mind having an animal to alert me. The problem is.. I've never liked dogs. I'm sure it's partly due to unresolved childhood trauma but an even bigger part of me simply doesn't like them. They are cute but I simply have no desire to ever be responsible for a dog. She 100% knows this, as she wanted a dog all through her childhood and I outright refused to have one in my house and therefore, she had one over to her dad's house. Given the fact that she knows I don't want a dog under any circumstances, this felt like a smack in the face. \"Unhelpful helping\", basically. I told her I didn't want the dog and she pretty much told me to \"give it a chance\". And Lord knows I tried but my heart condition has worsened since the animal has been in my home. Just since the dog has been here this heart problem has occurred easily 6 times, when usually it's only maybe once a week.The doctors say that stress is likely a causing factor. Not to mention that this service dog doesn't alert me for anything at all. When I go in to an episode the dog will just watch me from the corner of the room and go back to whatever he was doing originally, despite being \"professionally trained\" to be a medical alert dog. I simply don't want the dog here, I never did and this is not helpful at all. So I told her to bring him back. I'm all set and she should have known better. \n\nShe said that I'm acting ungrateful, that this was to give her \"peace of mind\" and she's 100% making it about herself, as she likes the dog. I still made her take him back and she did get a full refund for him but she's still saying I'm an AH for \"not giving it a chance and making her feel like her help isn't good enough.\" AITA?", "created_utc": 1682355577, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12xp4vo/aita_for_making_my_daughter_give_a_service_dog/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Service dogs are very personal, your anxiety is piqued by the dog's presence and your condition has worsened, all around a bad situation. Daughter is being 100% selfish.", "NTA. This doesn\u2019t seem like a professionally trained service dog at all, the stress is not helping you, you didn\u2019t want a dog to begin with, and if you needed a service animal I\u2019m sure your doctor would have already discussed options with you. It sounds like she fell for a service dog scam or just got a dog she wanted and claimed it was for you. Bottom line is the dog needs to go since it\u2019s making your health condition worse and you daughter needs to understand that.

Maybe it had some medical alert training, but the person and the service dog have to be trained TOGETHER so it can learn the signs of your specific issue. Where did she get this dog? Most organizations that train service dogs would never let someone just take one for someone else they've never met. It takes a huge amount of time and money to train a service or medical alert dog and there's usually a waiting list and face to face meetings to make sure they're compatible. There's no big medical alert dog store where they're just in bins and you grab the one that says \"for heart conditions\".", "NTA.

I did all the tests but once I quit my stressful job they went away. Might not be the case for you but something to think about maybe.", "This is not an actual service dog. Nobody reputable and/or official is going to let anyone \u201cgift\u201d a service dog\u2026they require a good deal of hands-on training with the new owner/handler and the dog to make sure it\u2019s a match.\n\nYour daughter might have meant well, but this isn\u2019t a solution, it\u2019s a new problem.

Your daughter used your illness as an excuse to get a dog, like she always wanted.

It isn't a service dog, its a pet for your daughter.\n\nExplain to her that the dog INCREASES your stress, doesn't reduce it.

Service dogs are amazing, and can be a real gamechanger for something like this, but they aren't simply a tool to improve your quality of life. They are a living, breathing, actual creature with needs that need to be met! The person the dog is for *needs to be completely on board* and while your daughter may have meant well, she was way out of line just gifting you one out of the blue.\n\nThat also said, you put \"professionally trained\" in quotation marks which I doubt is a mistake. I find it *very* hard to belief that a professional trainer of a medical alert dog would allow your daughter to just buy one and leave. Trainers work with the actual recipient to help them bond and learn the commands and all that stuff. Decent chance she just bought you *a dog* (the remaining chance is she was swindled by someone who claimed it was and it isn't).", "NTA since alerting you does no good anyways, a service dog would need to be trained to fetch *other people* when you have an episode - unless there is some medication you've been given to ward off the tachycardia. It's clear the dog is a stress factor for you, and your daughter should have known this. You need to sit down and discuss what's really bothering her. If, after that, she still thinks a service dog would help, then you need to discuss that with your doctor, who can recommend a good training program to sign up with.

You can\u2019t just go buy one because you think you need it (I.e. your daughter can\u2019t just go and buy one for you).  First, it has to be medically necessary.  An actual doctor has to be involved.  Someone can\u2019t just decided one is needed.  Second, they cost tens of thousands of dollars, not $1200.  Third, they are specifically trained for their job.  Not just oh hey, it\u2019s a service dog.  Especially when you\u2019re talking about a health problem like yours.  A dog would need to know your own personal crisis criteria and trained to respond accordingly.\n\nWhile this may be a wonderful dog, it is not a service dog.  It sounds like she is using that as an excuse for getting a dog she\u2019s always wanted.

My younger sister had it and what you describe having sounds a bit similar.", "NTA. Sorry, but your daughter has lied to you to get herself a dog. True medical service dogs are trained WITH the human that they are servicing so that they can alert properly. This is a long, drawn out and expensive process; there are applications and interviews and background checks to be done by the organizations that provide the dogs. Your daughter got herself a regular dog and is totally lying to you and faking everything else about it.", "NTA - this is not a medical alert dog.\n\nSuggest to your daughter that she gets a LifeLine Alert necklace. These go off if someone has a fall. The monitoring service then ring the home number, then the designated contacts, and if still no response send a medical response team. \n\nWhilst a trained medical alert dog can warn you, it won\u2019t stop you from collapsing.

Not dangerous just really uncomfortable. Daughters heart is in the right place but, yeh no. She's worried and disregarding your comfort. Have a frank discussion about it and of its not helping keep your daughter on an info diet if it's stressing her out too much.", "NTA. YOUR'RE the one with the health issues, NOT YOUR DAUGHTER.

Good luck!", "NTA Either your daughter is lying or she got scammed. Service animals go through a lot of training, alongside their potential owners, to make sure that they can work well together and that the animal is fully equipped to respond properly.\n\nPoint is you can't just buy or gift a random service animal to someone who's never interacted with them before, it just doesn't work like that and would only set you up for failure. You'd be right to make your daughter take the dog back, and hopefully the dog will find a nice forever home with a loving owner.\n\nIn the future, if your daughter is so set on getting you a service animal (it doesn't have to be a dog), then it needs to be something that YOU consent to and actively want to be involved with.", "NTA Your daughter is a big liar. \n\nService dogs cost around 10k and the trainers would not sell the dog without meeting you, checking your home or running some specialised training specifically with you.", "I got the same thing, my doc recommended \u201cshocking\u201d myself out of it if it gets too annoying.

It would be trained for YOU, for YOUR needs and YOUR symptoms.", "While some shelter dogs can potentially be trained to be service dogs if they show an aptitude for detecting something that still requires at least a couple of years of training **with you.** You can't just pick up a random dog and expect it to know to detect and then know how to service their owner in a way the helps them.\n\nGetting a service dog from people who train service dogs specifically is very expensive and way more than $1,200. Over $10k at least because of all the care and training that goes into these dogs.\n\nSo yeah either she got duped or she's trying to dupe you because she really wanted this dog but knew you don't like dogs or want one in your house. Either way clearly the dog is not doing what it's \"supposed\" to do and alert you and it's even actually making your condition worse because of the stress. If she really got this dog to make your life better she should be all on board to returning or rehoming the dog because it's clearly not working out. If she doesn't want to re-home the dog well that answers the question of why she got the dog and doesn't actually care for your health."]}
