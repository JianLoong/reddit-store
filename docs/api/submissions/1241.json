I honestly don't believe IATA in my heart of hearts, but most family members disagree so I'm taking it to the people.\n\nI've been with my dear husband (DH) for 15+ years. In all that time, his father has always been extremely pervy towards me. Its not just negative vibes or words or creepy glances. I mean that he is always wanting hugs, to sit next to me, to put his arm around me, to have any excuse to be near me. I have caught him peeking into our windows at home (on multiple occasions) even when he knew my husband was not home (his excuse is usually to \"drop something off\" which was always nothing we needed/wanted). He never gives a heads up when coming over and always tries to come to the back door (not the front like a normal person where we have a doorbell). He is always trying to \"open the door for me\" while standing in the doorway to try to brush up against me. He is always \"saving me a seat\" next to himself while his wife is across the table from him. He is a master manipulator and the 'man of the house' who has always been the sole breadwinner with a 'what I say goes' attitude and the family bows to his every whim. Ultimate old white man privilege.\n\nI have many stories to tell but I think this one will paint a clear picture. One time I made the enormous mistake of asking MIL for a ride to the airport, as DH and I were going on vacation and didn't want to pay to park our car (we've since learned our lesson). She brought her husband along although she was driving. He got out of the car and when I walked around to get into the back seat and my husband was putting our luggage into the trunk, he GOT INTO THE BACK SEAT WITH ME. Of course I said \"hey what's going on... no no no... husband get into the back seat, this is silly\" etc etc but he said \"oh no he needs to help mom with directions to the airport\" which was PERFECTLY INNOCENT right? And then everyone just proceeded on like this was normal. He then tried to put his arm around me in the back seat on the way there, and when I said EXCUSE ME he said he was \"just stretching out his shoulder\".\n\nSo cut to --- FIL is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Now its my fault I'm no contact, and why can't I just let bygones be, or whatever, because FAAAAaaaamily and he's Dyyyyyyyyying, and its his Last Christmas..... But I have drawn my lines in the sand and I don't want to be around this guy EVER again. Although I do have to see him at extended gatherings a few times a year, I walk away if he gets close to me, I don't speak to him, I won't go to their house, ride in their car, etc. His behavior has not/will not change, and he is not sorry.
