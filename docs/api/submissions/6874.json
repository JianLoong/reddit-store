His hospital bill before insurance was $1.8 million dollars. \n\nBy everyone I mean every voter in the USA who doesnt demand  tax payer funded 1st world hospital treatment.   You know that outside the USA this is unheard of in the 1st world and most of the rest of the world.", "NTA\n\nIn your shoes I would be furious. Sure, they took the life insurance policy on him but it\u2019s\u2026 insurance. To not offer to at least help you pay some of it seems callous to me.", "NTA if you ask them about the policy, but please be aware that you\u2019re not entitled to any of the life insurance money if you\u2019re not the beneficiary. \n\nI am so sorry for all of you involved. You\u2019ve lost someone special and irreplaceable. You\u2019re weighed down by grief and debt. His parents are grieving too. Try to be kind to them and yourself.\n\nYou should consider consulting with a probate attorney to determine what can be done with the medical debt. You may be responsible for less of it than you think. However, as to the life insurance, there\u2019s a general rule in the United States (and I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re in the U.S. because: medical debt) that life insurance passes outside of the decedent\u2019s estate and directly to the named beneficiary of the policy.", "NAH I know it feels strange, but that\u2019s a policy they paid for and were the beneficiaries, not you. Really, you and your husband should have had your own policies, naming each other as the beneficiaries to take care of each other. I\u2019d consider whether you still want a good relationship with them. People who didn\u2019t have the awareness to consider giving you some of the money, knowing that you have medical debt, are more likely to react negatively to a request that they gift you money.", "Oh that sucks. Still a good idea to talk to a lawyer. Also a good idea to straight up call the hospital the 1st of every month and say payments are too hard, can you waive some. A lot of hospitals have funds to pay for people in need. If they ask how much you can afford, tell them the tiniest amount, like $15/month or something crazy low.", "I'm gonna say NAH... You are right that it's selfish of them and a serious dick move to not offer to help, but it is their money at the end of the day. Getting clarification wouldn't be an AH move as long as they're open to it and you remember you're not entitled to anything. That being said, I'm very confused on why a grown, married man's parents would have an active life insurance policy on him... If COVID weren't the CoD, that would be the most suspicious thing to me.", "YTA. It's really not your business what they spend their payout on. Harsh, but true. You can ask them for help but don't be surprised or hurt of they decline. As for the huge medical bills, isn't there still done kind of government assistance for that? If all else fails, file bankruptcy and be done with it all.", "Your best move would be to talk to an attorney & see if you have to pay your husband\u2019s medical debts or not. If you are in the US, the law varies depending on what state you live in.  If you are responsible for this debt, YWNBTA to ask if your in-laws would help out. It never hurts to ask. Talk to a lawyer first.", "NTA.  There's right, and then there's legal.  It certainly would be the right thing for them to pay into that but human beings being the selfish creatures that they are, I wouldn't expect a dime.", "You WNBTA. Communicate the situation, and if possible UPDATE us if it goes left.", "This doesn't strike me as an AH situation, more of you needing legal advice. If you're in the States, check to see if you're in a \"community property\" state, which may give you rights to part of the life insurance. If you haven't done so, I'd also check to see if you actually share the medical debt. Also, check into protections under bankruptcy.\n\nAs for the parents-in-law, wtf.", "Why visit these people the are making renovations whilst you are being crippled by the debt incurred during their sons passing! They have not even offered you $1000 towards his medical bills. That is unreal. You are nicer than me it may be their money but they are showing you who they are believe them! Stop torturing yourself cut contact not for money but because your mental health will suffer while you obsess over how they can remodel while you are drowning in debt!!!!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He died, how is there a bill?\n\nAlso, my condolences", "Why are you paying medical bills? Debt is not transferrable upon death even to spouses. NTA, but talk to a lawyer about that debt. Parents are definitely assholes if they didn't use the insurance for funeral expenses and let you pay for them out of pocket, as typically, childhood insurance policies are for exactly that.", "YTA\n\nIt's fair to ask them for help. But if they bought a policy and paid on it, they have a right to collect. It's not something they owe you an explanation for.  Which, just frankly must feel really gross to you right now.\n\nIf your husband and his parents hated each other the next bit is off base\n\nBut I hope you don't lose sight of the fact that they lost him too. They may be renovating their house, but I don't imagine they wouldn't rather have their son. Going to them and asking 'why',  as if they did something wrong by having a policy on him or collecting it, is not the business.", "NTA What are you going to ask them though? Ask for money, an explanation. Do they know you have huge medical bills?", "YTA. They paid for the policy and they are the beneficiaries.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you lost your husband and are in debt. That\u2019s a separate issue and it\u2019s unfortunate, but the insurance policy has nothing to do with that other than they were able to collect on it because he passed away. It\u2019s not their fault either that he died or that you have bills.\n\nAnd when I say YTA, I don\u2019t mean that in a mean way. I only mean to point out that you have no claim on those insurance proceeds. So it\u2019s by way of explanation, not to actually suggest that you\u2019re TA.\n\nYou have my deepest sympathy on your loss.", "NTA if for no other reason than it's perfectly reasonable to ask a genuine question.\n\nFwiw, in my mind, the purpose of life insurance is to fund things that the deceased would have paid for and help cover costs related to the death (funeral, extended time off of work, etc). A new house renovation doesn't seem like something life insurance ought to be used for.", "It\u2019s not your money. You can ask about it, but please keep that in mind. NTA.", "NTA but you aren't entitled to any of that money. Keep that in mind.", "NTA\n\nPeople keep saying you're not entitled to the money, but that's not the issue here. You know you're not entitled to the money. \n\nThe issue is that you thought of them as family and yet they are treating your husband's death like a payday all with full knowledge that you are struggling to pay the remaining medical bills. \n\nYou would not be an ahole to express your disappointment. You have every right to your feelings on the matter.", "NTA but asking will only cause hard feelings. They suck. If you are able to file for bankruptcy, do it. Of course you don't have enough life insurance to pay off all of that debt. Most of us don't. \n\nWhat bothers me is that not only did they keep the money, apparently they haven't helped you figure out what you can do to get out from under this mountain of debt. It's like they don't care. That's like a punch in the stomach.", "I'm so sorry for your loss, and I can definitely understand why this is so shocking for you. \n\nI guess I'd urge you to tread carefully? His parents have suffered a huge loss too. It's possible they haven't fully comprehended that you're going to struggle to pay the bills. It's also possible the life insurance wasn't a huge amount of money (or at least, you haven't said if you know it was a huge amount) so maybe to them it was just the kicker to say 'we've been saving for this renovation for ages, now that we have the last little bit, let's do it to cheer ourselves up' and they may be justified in thinking their son would have been okay with that.\n\nMaybe not! Maybe they're complete assholes! I'd just take this slow until you're sure, because I have no doubt this was shocking and upsetting, but I'd hate for you to end up resenting them and pushing them away when you've already lost a loved one. \n\nWishing you healing and better times ahead, OP.", "NAH.  You feel shitty about them renovating their house with the insurance money which is fair.  But it\u2019s their money.  They don\u2019t have an obligation to help you. \n\nWhat are you going to say to them?  \u201cGive me money?\u201d \u201cHow dare you not give me money?\u201d \u201cPay off these medical bills?\u201d \u201cI hate that you got a life insurance policy and aren\u2019t giving me money?\u201d", "NTA, was any health insurance yours or his? Either way, if he left no estate I think there\u2019s a fair chance you can tell the hospital to kick rocks if you\u2019re in the US.", "NTA, but I doubt you'll ever see a penny. They kept this a secret from you for a reason, and legally, they don't owe you a cent.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't even open that door. It's clear from this post how they feel about you.", "YTA because this did not happen. Gotta love Reddit", "That sucks, OP; I'm sorry.", "Ask for an itemized bill for the medical costs. That alone should start bringing the costs down for you. As for any life insurance policies, first I wouldn\u2019t assume. Second, I wouldn\u2019t be mad. You and your husband could have had the same policies in place but you chose not to. This policy was probably purchased long before you were in the picture and they paid into it and continued to pay into it for years. Hound the hospital about every line item on the bill. Dispute dispute dispute and be the biggest pain in their side. You\u2019ll be amazed at how much money it\u2019ll come down.", "Why are you paying this? If you have that much COVID fund should have paid the hospital bill. If it didn't file bankruptcy.", "YWBTA if you ask why they didn\u2019t offer to help you pay the medical bills. It\u2019s okay to ask for help, but they don\u2019t owe you an explanation for what they chose to do with the life insurance money. Now as far as paying the medical bills, no hospital is seeing a single penny from me if my spouse died from a global pandemic.", "It did to me too!

I'll look into it.", "Exactly my 1st thought", "Right it sounds like the parents SHOULD help but the entitlement of OP is kind of out of nowhere. \nOP has every right to be upset about the situation but has zero claim to any money since they never paid for a life insurance policy", "I was seriously taken aback.

Either way, best of luck to you!", "NTA\n\nHowever, they know they are benefiting from their child\u2019s death while his spouse is drowning in medical debt. I don\u2019t think they care. You will probably be wasting your breath.\n\nI can assure you that someone who behaved as they are would no longer exist in my world.", "MAJORLY f-ed up. I'm so sorry you're going through this.", "But there is nobody to chase to pay the bill, they are dead. I don\u2019t get it", "File bankruptcy on the debt or tell the medical providers you are going to and try to negotiate. Also ask them to forgive the debt.
