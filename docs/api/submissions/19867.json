Why, if he wants you sleeping comfortably, does he not offer you the bed and sleep on the couch himself?  \n\nI think his pushiness on this should make you weary. You don't have a trusting family father/daughter relationship with this man. He may turn out to be lovely and you two develop that bond, but right now he is a stranger who contributed to your DNA. One that by his own admission, your mother kept away from you - (you should find out why from whoever on your mum's side you have contact with.)\n\nIf your friend told you this situation what would be your gut reaction? \n\nWhatever happened with your mum, be prepared to run back there or anywhere else that is safe if his behaviour escalates and you find him continuing to push boundaries under the excuse he is your dad. To be blunt, whatever situation had you cutting contact and moving in with a strange man twice your age who insists sharing a bed immediately is a normal daddy daughter thing - is probably not as terrible as getting raped by your dad.", "NTA, his insistence along with your mother\u2019s no contact policy is def red flag.

I shared bed lot of my family members. I have good memories of sharing bed together and sleeping on the ground with some of my family during parties and special occasions. It feels weird sleeping alone\n\nThough  I guess she doesn't feel comfortable since she never met him before.", "This sounds like the kind of thing my dad would do. Nothing nefarious, he\u2019s just got terrible personal boundaries and thinks that as long as he\u2019s ok with it, then everyone should be. It would be a good idea for OP to set and hold clear boundaries from the start to avoid her dad overstepping.", "thank you for saying that. Its super sad and sick that so many jump to these gross conclusions. my dad is from czech... not odd to sleep in the same bed.", "Or wake up with morning wood.", "For dads out there, get a body pillow to use as a wall if you are ever in that situation", "Why a lock?", "Please post an update tomorrow so we know your ok.", "Do you feel you are safe staying with him?", "Then, why?

I don\u2019t believe in talking around the point, so I\u2019ll just be straight with you: this behavior seems predatory. Be on your guard, and be prepared to make a quick escape if need be. \n\nLet me put it this way: why isn\u2019t your father offering to take the couch until the furniture arrives? Or buying an air mattress? I would expect a grown adult man to realize that of course an eighteen year old girl that he barely knows isn\u2019t going to want to sleep in a bed with him. That he\u2019s trying to talk you into it instead of finding an arrangement that would make you comfortable is a major red flag.", "you don't sound like you know the meaning of empath.", "Oh Honey.", "There kind of is, though. [Most sexual assaults are committed by somebody that the victim knows\u2014family members, acquaintances, etc.](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/perpetrators-sexual-violence) OP is a young woman who has no real support outside of her dad, a man that she has had almost no contact with since she was a child. Now he\u2019s pressuring her into sharing a bed, and insisting that it\u2019s normal\u2014even though OP has made it clear that she isn\u2019t comfortable doing that. He could buy an air mattress, or take the couch himself, or hell go to an IKEA and put the bed together in a day. Why isn\u2019t he? Why is he continuing to push this? Any way you slice it, the situation is ripe for exploitation. I mean I slept in my parents\u2019 bed a lot when I was a kid, and even some in my teens (I had really horrible anxiety) and even I think that it\u2019s weird. I was comfortable doing it because I knew that my parents would never hurt me, but it takes time to build that kind of trust. Sleep is a really vulnerable time for human beings!\n\nI\u2019d love to live in a world where this wasn\u2019t a concern. But unfortunately, it is\u2014especially for young girls.", "Yes actually.

He\u2019s functionally a stranger to her, AND to top it all of there\u2019s a major power imbalance between them (because she\u2019s reliant on him for a place to stay.) Statistically speaking, you\u2019re most likely to be assaulted by a family member\u2014so it\u2019s not unreasonable to be cautious, *especially* as a young woman. There are a lot of factors that make this situation uniquely precarious and rife for exploitation on the father\u2019s part.", "Those cultures do this when ppl are familiar with each other.

OP is obviously not from your culture, which means it does not apply AT ALL.", "Oh no I mean I've seen heaps of people say they wouldn't sleep next to their parent and I started to think I was weird. \n\nI couldn't sleep in a stranger's bed no, the insistence alone is too much. And yes my parents couldn't give a flying fart in space where I slept at their house. \n\nLike I said no means no, she stated she's uncomfortable. That's it and end of. I do hope she can be where she's comfortable asap.", "But OP is not a stranger to her father, so it's not weird for him to offer.

I really do hope she can get back home or somewhere safe asap.", "It wouldn't be that weird if they had a relationship. They don't, he's a 100% a stranger she met a day or two ago. The fact he's carried on pushing this when he or she could sleep on the couch is what is weird.", "So dad can't come in to OP's bedroom to \\*snuggle\\*.", "Because he may be a creep / be pushing because he wants to grab something.", "Perhaps because it's better than a park bench?", "They're saying that their dad is the same as the comment their replying to, not OPs dad.", "And that's not what empaths are. They can empathize, or feel what people feel (theoretically)... not tell if they are sick, physically or mentally", "It's not crazy to everyone in every culture. I think it's fair for commenters to tell OP to be careful and hold her boundaries about this issue, look for possible red flags etc, but it could be totally innocent and it's wrong to tell someone that their father is definitely a predator who wants to sexually assault them when they have such little information about these people and the entire context.\n\nDad could just be in a culture where bed sharing is very normal between family members, he could be thinking of it in terms of he's missed out on so much time with his child and, maybe naively, wants to have some kind of bonding experience that parents often get sharing their bed with their child when they're little, and it hasn't even occurred to him it could be seen as inappropriate because of her age because that sort of thought is so far from his mind. He might be trying to push father-daughter closeness because he's missed so much, we he shouldn't do, but it might be coming from a place of being desperate to forge a close bond and act as though they are very comfortable with each other like they would've been had he been able to see her all the time growing up.\n\nIt could be that he has a bad back and can't sleep on the couch without giving himself serious pain, but also feels terrible about the idea of his daughter sleeping there and wants to make sure she has a bed to sleep in, and the idea that she might find it uncomfortable hasn't occurred to him. He might be insisting because he thinks she's just trying to be polite by taking the couch. Ok, so he should definitely accept her no and not force the issue, but it's not like the only option is that he wants to assault her. Nobody knows!", "Absolutely not. I have slept in the same bed with my friends more times than I can count. Girls, guys. Nothing weird about it at all. Maybe my friends and I are just more respectful and trusting of each other than those you surround yourself with. I am just using this to counter your extreme arguments that this is weird. \n\nThis situation comes off as a bit weird to me.

He bought her a new bed already though dude. I don\u2019t think there is any legitimate problem here and what you\u2019re hinting at wasn\u2019t even the subject at hand.", "No? When I went on a camp with my friend we shared a bed and it was certainly smaller than OPs dads bed", "But again like my post from the start, you don\u2019t know the context of this and are jumping to conclusions which is ironically exactly what you did to me.", "Oh yeah she should definitely be cautious and hold to sleeping on the couch, but I think it's a bit much to just assume that he must want to assault her.", "lets agree to disagree... it may be a huge bed. The thikng that for me puts major doubt into the idea he is a dangerous preditor is he ordered a bed...it just has not arrived.", "But maybe her father and mother are from different cultures.

It absolutly applies.", "Oh I agree there. I would happily sleep next to my dad if circumstances meant that was the logical solution  Reason being I have a healthy loving decades long relationship with my dad. Unfortunately not everyone gets to have that. I hope this dude is just oblivious and not predatory, but I don't love the situation she's in.", "if its a king size bed? Im not sayingnit shouldnt raise a red flag,... but its not as wierd as people are making it out to be  and it cant be 100% stranger is she showed up at his door asking to stay. and he wouldnt have even ordered a bed if he was as pervy as some here want to assume.....relax...there are good people out there.", "Oh gross. Yeah this all sucks", "\"Why\" pertains to why the mother didn't want her to spend time with her dad.

I am creeped out by your word choice.", "OP absolutely does sound weirded out, or at least uncomfortable.
