My order was about 20 minutes late which was no big deal. As soon as my driver dropped off my order they texted me telling me to increase my tip to $15 to \"help them out\" with their 2 kids and to give them a 5 star rating. $15 for a tip is more than I make in an hour at my job. It was also more than the cost of my food! I think it's extremely rude, unprofessional, and ungrateful to ask me to over double my tip. I reported them to doordash and asked for a refund for the original tip. Maybe that makes me an asshole, but I think they went way too far by sending that text. I was a waitress for numerous years and I would've gotten fired for acting like that. Any of my customers would've also taken their money back and not came back, which I think is to be expected.

Why in the hell would someone choose to reward horrible service? \n\nIf someone chooses not to tip, even though they receive great service, simply for the fact that they don't agree with tipping, you're right. It's wrong. However, tipping is NOT about paying a person's salary. Believing that tells me that you agree with restaurants who choose to pay their employees less than minimum wage, because hey, they can sucker the customer into making up the difference. \n\nTipping is, and always HAS been, about paying for service above and beyond. It's about rewarding a person for doing their job and then some. \n\nBy the way, by Federal Law, if a server does not make at least minimum wage with tips, the employer is required to make up the difference. So, by someone choosing to tip because \"hey, it's my job to make sure this person is paid, even though they suck at their job\", they are in fact helping the greedy-ass restaurant owners who choose to pay their employees less than at least minimum wage. \n\nAnd for the record, I tend to tip very well. There have only been 2 times in my life I refused to leave a tip. In both cases, the service was beyond \"horrible\".
