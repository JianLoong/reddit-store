Your brother was expecting you to watch his poorly behaved children, for free, so he could go out to dinner.", "NTA - take this advice from someone who's been in similar situations.\n\nThese days, there's many irresponsible parents and they shouldn't expect you to babysit their kids whenever they feel like; especially when they're hard to look after.\n\nI personally think you did the right thing, and you shouldn't feel guilty at ALL", "NTA. \n\nFirstly, you\u2019re under no obligation to babysit for anyone. Ever. If they\u2019re not your kids, they\u2019re not your responsibility.\n\nSecondly, you are well within your rights to be compensated for your time/effort when you do babysit. I suggest you look up the going rate in your area and tell your brother that he needs to pay, and ask you in advance. You could also include an emergency rate, and additional charges for overtime for his reference. \n\nThirdly, your parents need to get their act together. He\u2019s not only an adult, but an adult with kids. You\u2019re the one who they need to be protecting in this situation.

That being said, you're under no obligation to look after them, especially without compensation and at the last minute with no consideration for your time and plans.\n\nAs for your parents, I certainly didn't see any mention of them volunteering their own unpaid labor to look after their grandchildren. You might have been rude, but he was being both rude and entitled. \n\nP.S. Also, why is this grown butt man tattling to his parents? Seriously, that's just embarrassing. It honestly sounds like he should have grown up a little more himself before reproducing.", "NTA \n\nYou aren\u2019t obligated to babysit especially when they don\u2019t listen to you.

I made out of pocket statements like this all the time as a teen (cause you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know) but looking back I had no idea what I was talking about.

You don't have to be an oncall babysitter.\n\nActually, it's your brother who owes you the apology for acting so entitled and inconsiderate.", "ESH.  You only because you called him a lazy dad.  Not paying you is not lazy, it is cheap.  Wanting a night out is not unreasonable.  What is unreasonable is not asking beforehand, not accepting no for an answer, and not paying you.  Not everyone wants to babysit and if that is the case, you should make it clear that you don't like babysitting and that is why you won't do it.  Four and five year olds can be quite a handful even when normally well behaved.  Part of babysitting is getting the kids to recognize your authority and making them behave in an acceptable manner.  \"They were rude they constantly kept telling me curse words and chucked their toys at me,\" says they did not accept you as an authority figure and/or maybe you did not act like an authority figure.  Part of that is on you, part of that is on their parents as they should have made it clear that you are in charge and they are to obey you.", "ESH/NAH\n\nYou escalated quickly at an inopportune time. You jumped straight to the kids are a nightmare, he's a bad dad, and you want to fundamentally change your relationship. And you did it while he was in a rush. \n\nThe bad behavior should have been brought up all along, after each incident. The change in attitude towards babysitting should have been brought up after the last disaster, with you saying you weren't going to do it anymore without notice/ pay/ whatever. Calling him a bad dad is one of those things people don't forgive. \n\nYou're in your own rights not to babysit, especially not last minute for a non-emergency, but you didn't go about it in the best way, or a constructive manner.\n\nYour brother was behaving the way he has been taught is acceptable and ok, and, from his point of view, was attacked out of nowhere and responded reactively.\n\nStill, you're a teen, and this is a difficult, complex situation to navigate and set of conversations to have. \n\nI'm going to recommend you have some heart to hearts with your parents about your feelings of being taken advantage of and that something needs to be done about the niece and nephews' behavior.
