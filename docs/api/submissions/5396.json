Not paying you is not lazy, it is cheap.  Wanting a night out is not unreasonable.  What is unreasonable is not asking beforehand, not accepting no for an answer, and not paying you.  Not everyone wants to babysit and if that is the case, you should make it clear that you don't like babysitting and that is why you won't do it.  Four and five year olds can be quite a handful even when normally well behaved.  Part of babysitting is getting the kids to recognize your authority and making them behave in an acceptable manner.  \"They were rude they constantly kept telling me curse words and chucked their toys at me,\" says they did not accept you as an authority figure and/or maybe you did not act like an authority figure.

The change in attitude towards babysitting should have been brought up after the last disaster, with you saying you weren't going to do it anymore without notice/ pay/ whatever.

You did exactly right by throwing it back at him that it is his responsibility to take care of his children, and treat you with respect.

Just because you are 17 doesn't mean that you don't have a life. You could need to study or had a date or wanted to hang out with friends. Why can't your parents watch the their grandchildren? Only caveat I have is expecting payment for hanging out with your niece and nephew is a bridge too far for me. By the same token, you shouldn't be the automatic babysitter. In addition, Chris should take some parenting classes. A four and 5 year-old shouldn't be behaving that poorly. I don't think that you have to apologize.
