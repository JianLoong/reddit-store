My ex and I share 50/50 but I get him on winter breaks so she could take him our of state to see her family in the summer.\n\nThe day before the surgery she asked me if Ry could stay at her place to recover from the surgery. I asked her why and all she said was that she just wanted to be there. I said no. Ry has never had surgery and it's a big deal for him. I don't want him to think that the first thing you when you face something scary is run to your mom and not your dad.\n\nI told her I was quite insulted by her request. Plus he was going to need help getting dressed, undressed and bathed for the first couple of days and I highly doubt that he'd be comfortable having his mom do that. She said her husband could do that.\n\nI told her no. He's having the surgery and I'm taking him to my house when he's released. I don't care if she's in the operating room. \n\nShe then asked if she could see him at my place and I said no. The agreement is that we have scheduled FaceTime with him when he's at the other parent's house. I don't want my ex wife in my home anymore than she wants me in hers. If the shoe was on the other foot then I'd understand whether I liked it or not. \n\nI held firm and things have been tense between us ever since. Personally I don't care because I'm not apologizing for not giving her what she wanted.\n\nEdit: No, my son doesn't get to decide who he gets to stay with and when and for how long. That's why there are custody agreements.", "created_utc": 1673520717, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/109wtph/aita_for_telling_my_sons_mom_that_hes_staying/", "score": 17375, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your son absolutely gets to decide in this instance. You're being incredibly selfish by not even considering his opinion. \n\nAnd you won't allow the mother of your kid to even see him post surgery?!\n\nThis is gross.

Perhaps your working day allows you to be available 24/7.  But you haven't indicated any of this on your post.

If you have the time and means to take care of him while he recovers, that's not a problem. \n\nBut have you asked your son where HE prefers to stay during this time?

Can you not for 3 weeks set your on ego aside in the interest of your kid? Can you not arrange he stays with you, and set a few days and times where his mum can come over while you go do the shopping or whatever? If you don't want her alone in your home can you not ask a friend of family member to be in the house in a different room during that time?\n\nIf you don't care about your ex wife's feelings that's fine.

He\u2019s 9 & I\u2019m sure that seeing both of his parents when he\u2019s unwell is both something that he wants and that he needs, regardless of a custody agreement. I\u2019m not saying that you should let her come over daily for long drawn out visits, but an hour or two every few days would be a good compromise. 3 weeks is a long time not to see your child after they\u2019ve had surgery.", "Though you never had me on your side- reading your comments further confirms my decision of YTA.\nYou have some hate you need to let go.", "I hate to say it but it does sound like YTA here. Obviously I don't know your dynamic with your ex, but she submitted a request to spend some extra time with your son after going through something pretty intense, maybe she herself is also worried about the surgery and getting to be there for him in the immediate aftermath would be a comfort to her. I imagine it is quite daunting to know that your child is going to be going through what sounds like a major surgery and feeling powerless to do anything for him, unable to comfort him or take the pain away to protect him beforehand. I would suspect you feel more or less the same way about your child, but rather than acknowledging her fear you have just refused her point blank because you're trying to teach your child about who they should go to for comfort. Surely he should be able to go to BOTH of you because you are BOTH his parents and making sure that he is happy and safe and healthy should be your prime consideration over and above everything else. No matter how you and your ex feel about each other, you both took responsibility to bring him into the world, and that responsibility does not change just because you two have decided to part ways. \n\nI wish your son all the best for his operation and a swift recovery.", "YTA\n\nThis should not be about you but about your son and I can tell you that without a doubt, he would have wanted to see his mum.\n\nSo what if you have a terrible relationship with his mum.

Red flag.", "YTA \n\nYou weaponize you son's surgery & time of recovery and use it against your ex and to hurt her and show the power and control over the situation. \n\nOn top of that you use it as a tool of control against your son too, who probably would like to see both of his parents when he feels so vulnerable.\n\nOne has to be truly heartless to not even let the other parent visit when the kid is ill.", "YTA. Not because you want him at your home and to care for him during your time, that's great. This is a major surgery and he is 9.

Your not the asshole for wanting to look after your son during the agreed upon time but I think due to the circumstances of the surgery that you should allow his mother to visit him during the recovery.

It\u2019s also the home where a parent will allow a child to see the other parent regardless of what issues the parents have together. It\u2019s the parent who is able to emotionally step aside and do what is in the best interest of the child. Your son will likely want cuddles from his mother and comfort.
