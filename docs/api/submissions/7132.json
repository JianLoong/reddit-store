My ex and I share 50/50 but I get him on winter breaks so she could take him our of state to see her family in the summer.\n\nThe day before the surgery she asked me if Ry could stay at her place to recover from the surgery. I asked her why and all she said was that she just wanted to be there. I said no. Ry has never had surgery and it's a big deal for him. I don't want him to think that the first thing you when you face something scary is run to your mom and not your dad.\n\nI told her I was quite insulted by her request. Plus he was going to need help getting dressed, undressed and bathed for the first couple of days and I highly doubt that he'd be comfortable having his mom do that. She said her husband could do that.\n\nI told her no. He's having the surgery and I'm taking him to my house when he's released. I don't care if she's in the operating room. \n\nShe then asked if she could see him at my place and I said no. The agreement is that we have scheduled FaceTime with him when he's at the other parent's house. I don't want my ex wife in my home anymore than she wants me in hers. If the shoe was on the other foot then I'd understand whether I liked it or not. \n\nI held firm and things have been tense between us ever since. Personally I don't care because I'm not apologizing for not giving her what she wanted.\n\nEdit: No, my son doesn't get to decide who he gets to stay with and when and for how long. That's why there are custody agreements.", "created_utc": 1673520717, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/109wtph/aita_for_telling_my_sons_mom_that_hes_staying/", "score": 566, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you have the time and means to take care of him while he recovers, that's not a problem. \n\nBut have you asked your son where HE prefers to stay during this time?

Obviously I don't know your dynamic with your ex, but she submitted a request to spend some extra time with your son after going through something pretty intense, maybe she herself is also worried about the surgery and getting to be there for him in the immediate aftermath would be a comfort to her. I imagine it is quite daunting to know that your child is going to be going through what sounds like a major surgery and feeling powerless to do anything for him, unable to comfort him or take the pain away to protect him beforehand. I would suspect you feel more or less the same way about your child, but rather than acknowledging her fear you have just refused her point blank because you're trying to teach your child about who they should go to for comfort. Surely he should be able to go to BOTH of you because you are BOTH his parents and making sure that he is happy and safe and healthy should be your prime consideration over and above everything else. No matter how you and your ex feel about each other, you both took responsibility to bring him into the world, and that responsibility does not change just because you two have decided to part ways. \n\nI wish your son all the best for his operation and a swift recovery.", "YTA\n\nThis should not be about you but about your son and I can tell you that without a doubt, he would have wanted to see his mum.\n\nSo what if you have a terrible relationship with his mum.

Not because you want him at your home and to care for him during your time, that's great. This is a major surgery and he is 9.

Your not the asshole for wanting to look after your son during the agreed upon time but I think due to the circumstances of the surgery that you should allow his mother to visit him during the recovery.
