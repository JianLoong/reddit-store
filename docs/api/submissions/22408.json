He may have meant well, but an unintentional a-hole, is still an a-hole.  I'm not sure how much clearer you could've made it... You can't play switch bc the screen gives you migraines, you asked for craft supplies, set a $25 max on a gift, & he respected 0 of those boundaries/ requests.  However, that doesn't mean he's not overall a great guy, but is definitely clueless and immature.", "NTA\n\nI *WOULD* have called you stuck up and bratty if it wasn't for the fact he asked you what you wanted and you flat out told him you didn't want a switch. \n\nThis was clearly a gift for him.", "NTA.

You were extremely clear in your answers to his questions, told him exactly the kind of gift you\u2019d like, a low price range and that you absolutely had no interest in the Switch; there should have been no confusion. Your boyfriend, in turn, ignored everything you said and bought you something *he* wanted, pawning it off as a gift for you when it was something you\u2019d clearly stated you did not want. It seems him telling you he traded in some cards might be part of what\u2019s guilting you, but again you never asked him for any of this, these were all his decisions and his actions.\n\nYou have nothing to feel guilty about.

Even if we give him the benefit of the doubt and say he was trying to be nice, getting someone and expensive present does not mean it is something they will like. Don\u2019t feel guilty, you communicated what you wanted and if that is ignored there is nothing you can do about that", "NTA - You wanted an inexpensive gift (craft supplies).

When communicating with him about gifts if he suggests something you don't want just say \"No, not interested\".

You told him you didn't want it.\n\nFor his birthday, you should start buying the things that \\*you\\* want.  See how he likes it then.\n\nNTA.", "I am curious, does he often do this sort of thing often? Like prioritizing his interests over yours when it comes to dates, food etc.?", "NTA.  \n\nHe's showing you who he is.  Will you believe him?", "I was going to mention this but you beat me to it", "Perfect reference, the game he got with it is akin to the name on the ball to just solidify that it was a gift to himself. He geys to be selfish and make OP question if they're an asshole or not.", "Not to mention it literally makes her sick, so she couldn't even play it just to be nice.  That's what baffles me the most.", "No. Only when it comes to gifts because he gets so excited to share his interests with me. Other than the gift giving he has been an amazing boyfriend for almost 3 years.", "Alright. Well I think this is just the straw that broke the camel's back, and discussing this earlier could have been a good idea. He seems immature and selfish in this case, since your birthday and gift should be about you, not him. Not to mension he ignored your health issues too. He did deserve the scolding. \n\nNow lets see if he is able to learn from this, or is he going to become bitter and defensive."]}
