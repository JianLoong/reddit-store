That's what baffles me the most.", "No. Only when it comes to gifts because he gets so excited to share his interests with me. Other than the gift giving he has been an amazing boyfriend for almost 3 years.", "Alright. Well I think this is just the straw that broke the camel's back, and discussing this earlier could have been a good idea. He seems immature and selfish in this case, since your birthday and gift should be about you, not him. Not to mension he ignored your health issues too. He did deserve the scolding. \n\nNow lets see if he is able to learn from this, or is he going to become bitter and defensive.", "Info: did he get you a replacement gift since the switch was clearly for him?", "NTA.\n\n\nHe got it for himself.

You didn't mention him getting you anything else, so he literally didn't get you a birthday gift and bought himself a switch and games instead. This kid sucks.", "NTA He's using weaponized incompetence and he really outdid himself. It's almost genius. He buys himself a present that you can't use and don't want, gives the present to you and then gets upset that you didn't want it after you repeatedly told him you didn't want it. Then he grudgingly took the present back and kept it.\n\nNow, he not only didn't have to actually spend any money on you, he also got to be upset at you and make you feel bad. For the cherry on top of the shit sundae, you now think he is bad at giving you presents, so your expectations are really low for the next present. \n\nI do wonder though what he would have bought himself for your birthday if you said you wanted a switch.

Honestly, it's a huge red flag of narcissistic behavior. I recently got out of a horrendous relationship with a narcissist, and when I looked back on it, I realized my first sign was when all the gifts for me were things she wanted and she knew I didn't care for. When someone shows you signs that they'll disregard your wants and put themselves ahead of you, it's good to pay attention. My advice is to look for the exit.", "Boyfriend gives you something HE want that makes you physically ill to use?\n\nUM that's not a gift to you.  he planned on using your gift but getting the \"generous\" cred.\n\nIf the thought isn't centered on the receiver of the gift it is NOT \"the thought that counts\".  He did not think OP will love this, he thought he would love this.\n\nIf it was the thought that counted.  It would be yarn from the craft store when you do woodworking.  That is a mistake not a deliberate ACT.\n\nStop feeling bad.  YOU TOLD HIM YOU DID NOT WANT A SWITCH.  You told him that Switches make you sick.  You cannot have been MORE CLEAR.\n\n<<e did end up keeping the switch and games.>> OH what a surprise--and do you know what he tells himself.  Well I tried to get her a present--she turned it away.

How selfish and thoughtless of him", "Oh man does this ring a bell\u2026 Okay here\u2019s my take: \n\nMy sister\u2019s boyfriend always used to do this exact thing. No matter what she said about not liking video games and \u201cnot wanting to learn to like them either\u201d, he would always buy her Nintendo games so that one day they could \u201cplay them together\u201d (which, just like for you OP, invariably meant her sitting bored on the couch watching *him* play). \n\nShe ended up marrying that guy. Now they have two small kids. She gave up her career to stay at home with them, and he works. And guess what? *Every single night* he comes home from work, eats the dinner she cooked for them all, and then disappears into the game room until the kids are bathed and put to bed. And every weekend - both Saturday and Sunday - he fucks off with his friends to go mountain bike riding and leaves her at home with the kids. \n\nShe cries a lot. She didn\u2019t want to believe he was that selfish and shitty, but everyone else in the family knew he was from the moment he started ignoring her EXPLICITLY STATED PREFERENCES in order to keep buying \u201cgifts for her\u201d that were nothing but presents for himself. \n\nYour bf is not sweet. He is selfish. He is actively ignoring what you\u2019ve *told him* you want and don\u2019t want. He sounds just like my sister\u2019s shitty husband. You can do A LOT better. NTA.", "Don\u2019t let his guilt play work. That whole Magic Cards line was a play to take the attention off of the fact that he ignored EVERYTHING you said.

You told him you didn't want a switch and you explained why. You told him you didn't want him to spend more than $25.\n\nDid he expect you to erect a billboard saying \"DON'T BUY ME A SWITCH\"?\n\nLike I said, once you've made it clear as day, this is no longer a question of ignorance. This is pure selfishness on his part. Your boyfriend clearly does not care about your feelings.\n\nNTA at all.", "NTA. But I also don\u2019t think he\u2019s \u201csuper sweet\u201d or that he \u201cfelt really bad\u201d about giving you something you specifically asked him not to get. If anything, he felt bad for trading in stuff to get the Switch. \n\nI agree with the other commenter who said to get him craft supplies. And then take the craft supplies back, and break up with this idiot.", "NTA. if he can buy meaningful gifts for his friends and not for you it says a lot. LIke he doesn't see you as a friend, just someone to be kept happy so he can have fun with you while he cares more about the long term status of his friends so he buys them things that mean something to them.\n\nI've had people buy bad gifts but they at least tried to buy something I wanted, they just took a swing and a miss, when people don't even take a swing and deliberate buy things they know you don't want and it's just for themselves, it shows how seriously they regard the relationship.", "NTA, you told him what you wanted for your bday and he ignored you. He was clearly set on giving you the switch regardless of what you said. \n\nI would just have a convo with him about it, let him know that you appreciate that he wanted to get you something nice, but that you wish he would have listened to you when you said what you actually wanted. \n\nIt sounds like he is a guy who likes giving gifts and probably wanted to impress you with a good gift and thought that your only reluctance to him getting you the switch was the cost. \n\nlet him know that you wish he had listened to you and that you were planning on getting him the switch since you know how much he wanted one. make a plan to communicate gifts more clearly in the future and try to honour each others wishes,", "Wrap it up for his birthday", "NTA.

I commend you for being so forward :) \n\nI don't know if this is going to be a deal breaker for you.. but I would make sure to keep a close eye on his behavior and how he treats you.

Not presents, but things like a bottle of wine that was more my taste, or a takeaway that I preferred.\n\nSomething that might help is making gift giving no longer a surprise. Talk about the presents you're getting for each other. Suggest ideas; I suggested recently, for example, tickets for a comedian coming to my city for my wife's birthday, as they'd be touring fairly close to her birthday.\n\nWe both enjoy the comedian, and she liked the suggestion, but I could sense some ambivalence, so I asked her if she felt I would enjoy it more than she would, and she agreed, so I knocked the idea on the head and thought about other presents she'd enjoy more.\n\nI know the Reddit crowd will be going to the greatest extreme with disparaging him, but there's no reason this can't be a good learning moment, though it should be made clear that this sort of thing going forward is not okay.", "NTA.\n1.

It's not \"stuck up\" and it's certainly not \"bratty\" to not want a gift that you can't use - and it's *wise* not to accept an expensive gift from a boyfriend you haven't been seeing for very long since becoming an adult. Giving expensive gifts, well above and beyond what is reasonable, is a hallmark of *abuse*. It creates a feeling of obligation in the recipient.\n\nI'm not saying in this case your boyfriend was being abusive, or even that he was being childish by getting you a gift he really wanted (like a little boy who gets his mom a toy dinosaur for her birthday) but it was an inappropriate gift and you were right to refuse it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, for so many reasons.

If not why with the stack of other issues here would you question if you're an asshole for this one?\n\nAre you so certain he is \"a super sweet boyfriend\" or is he only super sweet in response to you being upset because between the ignoring what you want, getting what he wants, buying something that would Actively damage you, and pretending that \"watching him play\" is \"playing together\" it certainly doesn't sound like a particularly sweet guy.

You might need a better boyfriend. One that actually listens to you.", "Someone once told me, \"Go as you mean to be.\" Meaning, be straight about things from the beginning. The more you let slide, the worse and more repetitive it will become in the future. \n\nYou told him you don't like switches, yet he bought you one because he wanted it, in the exact colors no less. Imagine you said nothing and you're together another 20 years, and things like this are still happening. Set it straight now if you mean to continue the relationship. \n\nNTA.", "NTA \u2014 but if you ever want to try a switch again, I had the exact same problem until I got one of the new ones with an OLED (?) screen! it\u2019s a little more expensive, but it\u2019s worth it to not feel dizzy and headachey after like an hour lol. no guarantee that it would fix your headaches, but if the screen/graphics are the issue, it might be something to consider :)", "Op is nta, but I do disagree on the fact he\u2019s buying for himself.\n\nI think gaming is something he enjoys and wanted to do it w op. I think this was a misguided attempt to buy her something to entice her to get into his hobby.\n\nOp, invite him to craft with you. Spend time.", "Or Homer Simpson and the bowling ball", "Because then he'd have to spend $25 on someone other than himself", "Sounds like a shitty boyfriend.\n\nCongrats I guess?", "He might as well just have given it to himself at that point.", "NTA. He didn't listen to you or take your headaches into account and seems to be buying himself gifts.", "I got an ugly karaoke system that I did not like and never used, my wife knew from my face I did not like it but I did not say anything", "Extremely well said, \"selfishness masked by generosity.\" She had even made it extremely easy for him asking for crafts. He ignored the request, gave her something she specifically asked him not to, and then kept the \"gift.\" Make it make sense. Makes you wonder in what other situations he does this.", "I once dated and lived with a guy who was \"amazing\" at getting me gifts, everyone told me how lucky I was as we worked together and he would get flowers and hide them in my locker.....except he refused to buy my favourite flowers because he didn't like them but ignored the fact that he knew I didn't like strong smelling roses. I love sapphires but don't wear yellow gold and dislike hearts, I got a yellow gold heart pendant with a little bit of sapphire. One Christmas I got a violin as I mentioned I'd always wanted to learn but I mentioned it because he was in a band and they wanted to start one of their songs with a violin sample. I always felt guilty about being disappointed but they weren't ever gifts for me, they were gifts that made him look amazing to everyone else we knew or in the case of the violin also helped him in some way. Gift giving doesn't mean you get to refuse to listen to your partner and get something that means more to you than them.", "NTA \nYour boyfriend didn\u2019t listen to you at all.", "NTA\n\nI genuinely cannot believe that you told him not to get you a switch, he got you one anyway, made you feel guilty for not wanting it, and now YOU think YOU\u2019RE an asshole??\n\nI am begging you to dump this man.", "INFO: Marge, dat you?", "It seems like he actually got it for himself if he kept it he knew u wouldn\u2019t like it so then he wouldn\u2019t have to buy u something n he also gets a switch so win win for him", "That was so she'd know it from him!"]}
