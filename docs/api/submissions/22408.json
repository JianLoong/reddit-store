You told him you didn't want it.\n\nFor his birthday, you should start buying the things that \\*you\\* want.  See how he likes it then.\n\nNTA.", "I am curious, does he often do this sort of thing often? Like prioritizing his interests over yours when it comes to dates, food etc.?", "NTA.  \n\nHe's showing you who he is.  Will you believe him?", "I was going to mention this but you beat me to it", "Perfect reference, the game he got with it is akin to the name on the ball to just solidify that it was a gift to himself. He gets to be selfish and make OP question if they're an asshole or not.", "Not to mention it literally makes her sick, so she couldn't even play it just to be nice.  That's what baffles me the most.", "No. Only when it comes to gifts because he gets so excited to share his interests with me. Other than the gift giving he has been an amazing boyfriend for almost 3 years.", "Alright. Well I think this is just the straw that broke the camel's back, and discussing this earlier could have been a good idea. He seems immature and selfish in this case, since your birthday and gift should be about you, not him. Not to mension he ignored your health issues too. He did deserve the scolding. \n\nNow lets see if he is able to learn from this, or is he going to become bitter and defensive.", "Info: did he get you a replacement gift since the switch was clearly for him?", "NTA.\n\n\nHe got it for himself. Not you. \"Oh no! She doesn't want this gift that would give her migraines (Which she told me repeatedly)! Guess I'll take it!\"", "NTA. The part where he took back a gift was incredible. He just proved he bought himself a gift.", "NTA He wasn't buying you anything, he bought himself a present", "He's definitely not \"super sweet\", and you're NTA. He is.", "Why are you okay with wanting a $25 gift but willing to buy him a whole ass switch? You shouldn't have to accept cheap gifts while getting him extravagant ones because he refuses to listen to you. You didn't mention him getting you anything else, so he literally didn't get you a birthday gift and bought himself a switch and games instead. This kid sucks.", "NTA He's using weaponized incompetence and he really outdid himself. It's almost genius. He buys himself a present that you can't use and don't want, gives the present to you and then gets upset that you didn't want it after you repeatedly told him you didn't want it. Then he grudgingly took the present back and kept it.\n\nNow, he not only didn't have to actually spend any money on you, he also got to be upset at you and make you feel bad. For the cherry on top of the shit sundae, you now think he is bad at giving you presents, so your expectations are really low for the next present. \n\nI do wonder though what he would have bought himself for your birthday if you said you wanted a switch. I bet he would have bought you a different thing you didn't want but he did.", "NTA. \nIt was not stuck up or bratty, at all. \nHe dismissed your feelings and got something you didn\u2019t want//wouldn\u2019t use. \n He needs to realize that, and stop buying gifts for him in disguise as gifts for you.", "NTA. He bought it for himself. Word of advice: leave him now before you're in too deep. In my experience, people like this rarely ever change, and certainly never make decent partners.", "My friend\u2019s ex-husband had a habit of doing just that. The ultimate badly chosen gift was a remote-controlled helicopter toy - for her 40th birthday. She just cracked up laughing and he couldn\u2019t understand why. At this stage, she had a little guessing game at how badly he would choose. Of course, she accepted it, placed it in a cupboard, and refused to let him play with \u201cher\u201d gift.", "NTA. Honestly, it's a huge red flag of narcissistic behavior. I recently got out of a horrendous relationship with a narcissist, and when I looked back on it, I realized my first sign was when all the gifts for me were things she wanted and she knew I didn't care for. When someone shows you signs that they'll disregard your wants and put themselves ahead of you, it's good to pay attention. My advice is to look for the exit.", "Boyfriend gives you something HE want that makes you physically ill to use?\n\nUM that's not a gift to you.  he planned on using your gift but getting the \"generous\" cred.\n\nIf the thought isn't centered on the receiver of the gift it is NOT \"the thought that counts\".  He did not think OP will love this, he thought he would love this.\n\nIf it was the thought that counted.  It would be yarn from the craft store when you do woodworking.  That is a mistake not a deliberate ACT.\n\nStop feeling bad.  YOU TOLD HIM YOU DID NOT WANT A SWITCH.  You told him that Switches make you sick.  You cannot have been MORE CLEAR.\n\n<<e did end up keeping the switch and games.>> OH what a surprise--and do you know what he tells himself.  Well I tried to get her a present--she turned it away.  And I'm betting He never got you those craft supplies for your birthday.  I bet you received NO new present.", "It\u2019s sad you think this behavior is okay.

He doesn't seem to care about your opinion.\n\nI don't care how sweet you think he is.  He is obnoxious.  He gets what he wants.  He doesn't hear you when y ou state unambiguously do not get me a switch.\n\nNTA.  Seriously rethink the relationship.  He is not putting in the effort.", "NTA", "Dump his ass.", "Yes, and Marge called his bluff and ended up taking bowling lessons from a hunk that put the moves on her.  The kids gave  her a tube of Topol, the smokers\u2019 tooth polish, but she wasn\u2019t a smoker.\nAlso NTA", "he got a gift for himself, and made op feel guilty for it. what a prince. nta.", "Exactly. Like why couldn\u2019t he have just bought the switch for himself and got her the crafting stuff?", "I hope she also didn't get him a Christmas/anniversary gift because he clearly already has his own gifts taken care of. How selfish and thoughtless of him", "Oh man does this ring a bell\u2026 Okay here\u2019s my take: \n\nMy sister\u2019s boyfriend always used to do this exact thing. No matter what she said about not liking video games and \u201cnot wanting to learn to like them either\u201d, he would always buy her Nintendo games so that one day they could \u201cplay them together\u201d (which, just like for you OP, invariably meant her sitting bored on the couch watching *him* play). \n\nShe ended up marrying that guy. Now they have two small kids. She gave up her career to stay at home with them, and he works. And guess what? *Every single night* he comes home from work, eats the dinner she cooked for them all, and then disappears into the game room until the kids are bathed and put to bed. And every weekend - both Saturday and Sunday - he fucks off with his friends to go mountain bike riding and leaves her at home with the kids. \n\nShe cries a lot. She didn\u2019t want to believe he was that selfish and shitty, but everyone else in the family knew he was from the moment he started ignoring her EXPLICITLY STATED PREFERENCES in order to keep buying \u201cgifts for her\u201d that were nothing but presents for himself. \n\nYour bf is not sweet. He is selfish. He is actively ignoring what you\u2019ve *told him* you want and don\u2019t want. He sounds just like my sister\u2019s shitty husband. You can do A LOT better. NTA.", "Don\u2019t let his guilt play work. That whole Magic Cards line was a play to take the attention off of the fact that he ignored EVERYTHING you said. This makes him look selfish and manipulative. Keep and eye on him. He may not be what he seems.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You should have returned it and kept the proceeds. You are very young . Try not to get so wrapped up in a guy.", "Being somebody who was like this at that age. It most certainly was a gift for himself. Honestly, you need to cut and run. You could call him out, but it probably won't do much", "There is a point where ignorance is no longer an excuse.\n\nYou told him you wanted craft supplies. You told him you didn't want a switch and you explained why. You told him you didn't want him to spend more than $25.\n\nDid he expect you to erect a billboard saying \"DON'T BUY ME A SWITCH\"?\n\nLike I said, once you've made it clear as day, this is no longer a question of ignorance. This is pure selfishness on his part. Your boyfriend clearly does not care about your feelings.\n\nNTA at all.", "NTA. But I also don\u2019t think he\u2019s \u201csuper sweet\u201d or that he \u201cfelt really bad\u201d about giving you something you specifically asked him not to get. If anything, he felt bad for trading in stuff to get the Switch. \n\nI agree with the other commenter who said to get him craft supplies. And then take the craft supplies back, and break up with this idiot.", "NTA. if he can buy meaningful gifts for his friends and not for you it says a lot. LIke he doesn't see you as a friend, just someone to be kept happy so he can have fun with you while he cares more about the long term status of his friends so he buys them things that mean something to them.\n\nI've had people buy bad gifts but they at least tried to buy something I wanted, they just took a swing and a miss, when people don't even take a swing and deliberate buy things they know you don't want and it's just for themselves, it shows how seriously they regard the relationship.", "NTA, you told him what you wanted for your bday and he ignored you. He was clearly set on giving you the switch regardless of what you said. \n\nI would just have a convo with him about it, let him know that you appreciate that he wanted to get you something nice, but that you wish he would have listened to you when you said what you actually wanted. \n\nIt sounds like he is a guy who likes giving gifts and probably wanted to impress you with a good gift and thought that your only reluctance to him getting you the switch was the cost. \n\nlet him know that you wish he had listened to you and that you were planning on getting him the switch since you know how much he wanted one. make a plan to communicate gifts more clearly in the future and try to honour each others wishes,", "Wrap it up for his birthday", "NTA. Remember this feeling, because this kind of treatment from a significant other is a red flag. Break up & avoid guys that treat you like this.", "NTA \u2014 He purposely went out of his way to get you something he knew you wouldn\u2019t enjoy. Especially when you were very vocal about the gifts you would want.", "Nta there's nothing wrong with expecting your gifts to be FOR YOU, not for the giver", "NTA he was being selfish on purpose and you seem to be the only person he does that too. Maybe it's time to reconsider the relationship", "NTA - he did not listen, he did not respect your wishes, and did not give any thought as to what you might want for a gift. Very asshole behavior on his part. You did nothing wrong.", "This is a new version of the husband buying the wife power tools. \nNTA but he definitely is, you should have returned it or sold them", "The other option, of course, is to keep the Switch and sell it on.\n\n\nThat'd learn him.\n\nNTA", "For sure. \"Sorry honey, I can't get you a replacement gift, the switch can't be returned and that was all I had saved up\"", "You know what you should do? For the next holiday with gift giving, get craft supplies that you want for a current project. He will either 1. Laugh and go \u201cokay, I get it\u201d or 2. Throw a hissy fit about them not being for him. And that gives you the opportunity to point out how you felt receiving the switch.", "Semi-amazing. Amazing boyfriends listen to their partners (and vice versa) and take their partners' needs and wishes into account when giving gifts and planning activities. NTA, and not bratty either."]}
