This isn't always the best platform to explain all of the nuance about potential gender identity dynamics in the middle of a larger post.  Maybe she has considered it, maybe she hasn't.  How should she be talking about her kids in a gender neutral way in the context of this particular topic?\n\nI also think that the OP was saying that in general, she believes that boys don't deal with as many hurdles as girls.  Not that all boys always have it easier than all girls. As a guy, I can look back on my childhood and find evidence to agree with that general statement, though it's not 100% ironclad and certainly doesn't apply to every boy.", "The fact the she is even saying things like \"boys have it easier\" means she already sees it at least a little bit as a pro-v-con situation. \n\nAgain, I said ***a little off***. \n\nAs for the transgender possibility, that's super easy in the context of this conversation. You say \"this conversation is stupid, what if they all grow up be trans?\" Boom. Done. \n\nOf course it's understandable that OP was ambushed, so she just got dragged into defending herself.
