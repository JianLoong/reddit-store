What *is* wrong with her to suddenly make her hate boys so much? And why is she so obsessed with your pregnancy (if it was a girl)? Is she unable to have children of her own? I feel like there are much deeper issues going on with your sister. This behavior is not normal.\n\nNTA. Honestly, your reaction was quite mild.", "Nta\n\nThe fact that she didn't end up with natural blue eyeshadow around her eyes, tells me you are the mature one in your sibling relationship.\n\nThe nerve to talk that way about innocent little boys that just wanted a hug from their aunt. \n\nDespicable.", "NTA your sister has some major issues that she probably needs to address with a therapist.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is insane, sexist, and she honestly sounds borderline sociopathic when it comes to boys and men. You did nothing wrong and you certainly don't owe her an apology, she owes you and your boys an apology. For the sake of your boys keep them away from her.", "NTA. \n\nIf she makes rude or intrusive comments about your family or fertility, the correct response is \u201cthat\u2019s a strange thing to say; I have to pet the dog/say hi to Uncle Harold/get a drink.\u201d\n\nYou can also explain to your kids that their aunt has been acting a little strange and at the next family gathering, focus on other family members and don\u2019t greet her with a hug.", "Holy Cheese and crackers...that \"woman\" would never go anywhere near my children again. NTA. In fact, I don't think you went far enough.", "Yeah, NTA. She thinks you should apologize to her when she\u2019s right, okay, she wasn't right so no apology needed. In all seriousness, this is really weird on her part and pretty unacceptable to be treating kids differently based on gender. While I definitely think it's good to teach kids to ask before hugging and all that (and that it's always ok to say no), that's something for everyone, not just boys. And then everything was completely downhill from there, unacceptable to be saying about you and your kids.", "NTA. I would distance myself from her.

She sounds toxic and I would make sure she isn't around the boys when you aren't there.", "NTA\n\nYou're a kickass mom for standing up for your boys like that. Your sister was way out of line.

They shouldn't be around her.", "NTA. Your sister is vile though. Not sure I'd let her around my kids again.", "Definitely NTA, op. How can your sister take out her sexism on your kids and act like she did nothing wrong? They did nothing wrong to her. Even worse, she thinks she's right!

I have all boys and my sister has all girls and she would never dream of treating my boys like this and God help anyone that does and she finds out about it cause she\u2019s that crazy aunt that has no filter AND she\u2019s a mom to three very tough girls lol.", "Probably sister's husband wanted a boy and sis had a girl.

That makes me feel a bit better.", "On top of that, OP isn't trying for a girl, so sister has decided this means that daughters aren't special. Sister is taking \"I'm done with pregnancies\" to mean \"boys are better than girls\" and then reacting to her own internal narrative. \n\nI personally think the whole \"boy mom\" personality is exhausting but I'm not seeing OP present herself that way. Somebody who has three babies has something like a 12.5% chance to have 3 boys or 3 girls. It's just chance. Sister needs to chill the fuck out.\n\nUltimately, it's just not okay to treat OP's kids poorly for any reason, especially something that isn't up to them. OP has to stick with the protective instincts until her sister gets her mind right."]}
