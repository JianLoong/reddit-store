And he should have NO control over your diet, that disgusts me and is a huge red flag.", "NTA, but also he may not be the asshole either (the odds aren't good but I am giving him as objective a shake as I can). I am also refraining on commenting on the birth control stuff because, although I do find the unilateral control a little concerning, you do say that he is an \"amazing boyfriend\" and I am taking you at your word for that.\n\nThere's a lot of layers we could unpack here about whether \"sickly thin\" should even be considered attractive, or how sex and attraction is a freaking huge thing in your twenties and as a foundational basis of most relationships, or even precisely how much weight you put on and if you even are \"unattractive\" (I think sexy has a broader range than most people may realize).\n\nBut, at the end of the day, it SUCKS to be in a relationship with someone who does not share your dietary or fitness habits/values, or at the very least support them and have very frequent/open dialogue about discrepancies and maintaining boundaries. For someone who is invested in food and exercise is spending a \\*lot\\* of their personal time keeping to that regimen, having your partner or close friends keep throwing it off--and I have to emphasize, with totally innocent, normal, relationship-y things like \"having a dinner date\" or \"watching a movie\" instead of \"eating my prepped meal\" or \"getting a workout in\"--just feels like constant sabotage of your goals and the person you want to be. And for someone who doesn't want to participate in that rat race--either they just enjoy good food more, or don't care about keeping up with the Joneses, or have health/injury/age issues--they get to deal with all the one-sided accommodations, not to mention whatever weird narcissistic quirks start to accumulate with a gym body that may include not being seen as attractive by their partner anymore.\n\nSo while I understand why your bf would want to keep the pantry fairly clean and free of temptation, I also think it's unfair for you to have to sacrifice that much of your diet and brain space to accommodate his lifestyle. I definitely don't think he should be dictating what \\*you\\* can eat based off of \\*his\\* macros, although from experience I will say that we do have a tendency to want to \"match\" our partners, and can't help it when eating together is a common relationship feature. I still have resentment for one of my bodybuilding partners getting me fat off of too many months of Raising Canes, and another bodybuilding partner for getting me fat off too much butter and wine (they are married to each other now, I'm free!).\n\nI foresee this becoming a bigger issue if you do not talk it through and resolve it. We have no information on whether he would be less attracted to you, but what we do know is that he has his own health goals that you are not jiving with, and partners can be the biggest \\*boon\\* or the biggest \\*obstacle\\* toward very fundamental personal goals like that. We also know that he is not doing a very good job of separating his goals and habits from yours, and so with that level of enmeshment things are only going to become more tense if you two don't ultimately bring yourselves together into some sort of alignment. Relationships fall apart over this particular issue if it isn't addressed with a lot of communication, collaboration, and compromise (and even then it's not a guarantee because some people are just shallower than others).\n\nI am in no way trying to suggest you do something you do not want to do. And I furthermore want to emphasize that trying to change things about yourself for a partner is...precarious. There is a difference between working on yourself to be a better partner, versus chasing ideals to try to hold onto someone. But...I personally think healthy diet and exercise are just really good for the self, especially if you can click into whatever variations on that work for you. I think that is someone everyone universally benefits from, if they can get past the self-doubt/shame and learn to ignore all the narcissism our culture wants to associate with it.\n\nAlbeit, it would be a lot easier question to ask if you weren't in a relationship with a guy who is pressuring you. But if we could toss this all aside and focus solely on **you**: would you be open to trying to get into a little routine? Not for him, but for you? Put another way, could you see yourself being *interested* in that? Because if so, maybe your differences aren't that irreconcilable. And again, I have to emphasize, that this would have be to be a decision \\*for you\\*, for your own health and self-confidence, and only incidentally that would which happen to sync up with him. Something that you could see yourself doing on your own, even if things ended between you two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this could be resolved with a simple conversation clearing up if this is about him, or about you, or about both of you. Maybe you can reach an understanding that you can support him and he won't hold you to his diet anymore. Or maybe you won't reach an understanding but learn valuable new information about what this actually is all about.\n\nBecause, as I see it, I don't see this relationship going well. And for all of whatever pressure he is putting on you, I also don't think it is fair to flip it back on him and expect him to set aside his health goals...that would just be a reciprocal flavor of shittiness. So it would be much better to just accept the lack of compatibility and move on, imo.
