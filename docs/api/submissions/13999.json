If i\u2019m reading this right you basically stole what someone else dropped?", "Yes, YTA. That\u2019s still stolen goods. They are not yours to take.", "Seriously? Of course YTA, you're also exposing yourself to being arrested for receiving stolen property. What is wrong with you kid?", "YTA You're stealing. \n\nTake them back. If the store manager agrees that the boxes are items are as damaged as you say that they are, he may let you keep them anyway.  It may prove to be easier for him to claim everything as a loss than deal with those items. But take them back because it's the right thing to do.", "yes, of course YTA for stealing???????? \n\nyou're old enough to drive but you don't know the difference between right and wrong??", "YTA\n\nI love that some people willingly post online about the crimes they commit so they can more easily get caught. \ud83d\ude02", "You are a thief.  Very proud of your dad.", "YTA. What you did was still theft.

Doesn't matter if they were damaged or not, you are also a thief trying to profit from it. Duh.\n\nLmao with that logic, if I watched a thief steal a wallet and dropped it while running...I can fairly pick it up and keep it.", "The mental flexibility people can display while trying to twist reality to get whatever they want it insane. \n\nLike your logic pretends that if someone stole from YOU, dropped your stolen property in the street, and your neighbor saw it then it would be fine for them to keep it. You know this is ridiculous. YTA thief.", "YTA, that\u2019s evidence of a crime and it\u2019s possible that that $300 makes it go from misdemeanor to felony so your actions could be hindering justice on top of the fact that it\u2019s simply not your property and there\u2019s no question about whose property it is. So, you committed theft as well. It\u2019s not a small matter as it reveals your moral aptitude.", "YTA. Offer them back if the store refuses then they're yours. There's no honor in stealing, and your father is right to teach you that.", "You took stolen property. And convinced yourself it was ok because you didn\u2019t steal them yourself. Unfortunately. You took something that wasn\u2019t yours. You know who the owners are. And kept it anyways. Classic example of theft. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nEdit: to add YTA", "In hot news stealing is bad and against the law. In other hot news your Dad is completely sane and right. YTA", "YTA. Listen if you went in and said these were from those ladies that just stole, they maybe would\u2019ve given you one (prolly most damaged one) but at least you wouldn\u2019t also be a thief. The worst part is you trying to justify how you\u2019re not but cmon, what almost adult (since you\u2019re driving) steals LEGOS and gets mad when his dad says \u201chey obviously you can\u2019t be a thief go return these\u201d like??? Dude he could easily turn you in as well to teach you a lesson. Did you think of that? Just go return the toys man.\n\nEdit: spelling", "YTA and it's \"paying attention\" not painting attention.\n\nPay attention in school, child.", "If the po po show up on your doorstep because they saw your license plate on the security camera footage, yeaaa.

Have fun paying for a defense lawyer YTA", "YTA, you never know if a store does or does not want something even with a damaged package back, especially since you stated they were quite expensive. You acted immoral and stole a store's property. Your dad is right, and you should definitely talk to the owners and return. You can't decide whether they want it back or not without actually asking them.", "YTA - little thief. That's how you develop an allergy to legos. Make you break out in handcuffs.\n\nYou deserve no legos, and no car.", "If I steal a car from a dealership, but then I get out and run from the cops leaving the door open. If you, having witnessed this and knowing that I stole the car, get in and drive off, the car doesn't suddenly become yours. It's still stolen property, it still belongs to the dealership because it was never purchased and if you get caught with it, you're going to get in trouble for having it.\n\nHere's another scenario, one that has actually happened: I work at a grocery store, when I'm at self checkout, people will often times leave behind the cashback they've requested; this can be up to $100. Do you know what happens if I just put it in my pocket because \"finders keepers\" and a manager sees me do it or the person comes back for their money and they check the cameras to see what happened to it? **I will get fired and, if the person wants to, can have me charged with theft.**\n\n\"Finders keepers\" is just what amoral people use to excuse keeping something that doesn't belong to them. Stolen items should always at least be attempted to be returned to the rightful owner; and in your case, the rightful owner of the Legos is the store that they were stolen from.\n\nYou're just as much of a thief as the original was.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Also as someone who works in a grocery store, **Yes we DO want those items back**. Damaged or not, those items are our inventory and we have a process to follow for items that were *attempted* to be stolen, but were not successfully stolen. We scan them out to see how much they were worth and log that amount, and then those items depending on what they were and how they were attempted to be stolen, one of three things will happen.\n\n1. They will go right back on the shelves. Either the packaging isn't damaged at all or it is minimally damaged, but the product inside is fine. Either way it's not seen as a problem and will go right back on the shelf to be sold.\n2. It will get marked down and go back on the shelves. The packaging is pretty banged up, maybe it's missing a few pieces from inside the box or maybe the box is completely destroyed but the bag containing the pieces is still intact. The item itself is still usable, not *too* damaged and wouldn't be dangerous to use. It can still be sold, but it won't be sold for full price.\n3. It will get thrown out. The packaging is completely destroyed, most of the item has been lost or broken, it would be dangerous if we sold it for use in it's current state. It will be scanned out as damaged and thrown away as we can no longer sell it and it would be a liability if we did so.\n\nFrom how you say the \"box was damaged\", it sounds like you're looking at either the first or second option.", "YTA\n\nYour whole argument is based on the store not wanting them back. If that is really true, then explain to the manager what happened. If they say that you can keep it, then good for you. If not, then give it back.", "What's your logic for this being ok? They were already stolen? YTA", "Yta", "YTA the store probably thinks you were an accomplice of the two ladies. If they have cameras & your license plate I\u2019d be prepared to get a visit from the police.", "YTA. Receiving stolen property, and possibly robbery or larceny after the fact, are possible crimes you could be charged with. Your dad\u2019s absolutely correct: take that shit back now.", "YTA.  Neither you nor the shoplifter paid for them.  That is theft.  If they have cameras, then they could've gotten your description and your license plate.  You need to return them.", "I've spent like fifteen seconds on your post so let's run through the facts of what the police can identify you with since you already got your answer so we can laugh about how no \"anonymous\" this truly is:\n\n- you identified the make and model of your car that you used to flee the scene\n- you identified the stolen goods, and the amount\n- you've idenfitied other incriminating details such as the races of individuals involved, who was filming, etc. \n- you've identified your family structure\n- you've given away your location via IP addres\n- if you've accessed this on your phone, it doesn't matter if it's a throwaway account. Your access point will be obvious in a search.\n\n\nIf I forgot any feel free to add lol.", "I wish your Dad would have taken the car away just because you didn't have the sense not to be a thief in the first place.  But now you are in fuck around & find out territory.  \n\n\nYTA & karma's a bitch. You are racking up so much negative momentum with this. Is this really the path you want to go down? Is this really the life you choose for yourself? Regardless of the disappointment you are causing your Dad to feel about you, can you live with yourself? You are the sum of your actions & nothing more.", "That\u2019s a misdemeanor and up to 3mo in jail and $1000 fine in my state. Bordering on gross misdemeanor 12mo/$3000. Receiving stolen property is theft. YTA.", "I would be incredibly tempted to keep them but returning them is the right thing to do. \n\nWhat goes around, comes around. \n\nYTA if you keep them.", "YTA and a thief. You\u2019re no better than the shoplifters. You should have returned them to the store.", "YTA\nJust because someone stole them first doesn't make it OK.\nIt isn't a victimless crime as managers and employees get judged by how much stock is missing.\n\nIf you were able to take them back safely, you were able to do the right thing and give it back to the store.", "So\u2026you\u2019re questioning if whether YTA or not for stealing LEGO and then bragging about it\u2026?\nOf course YTA, return the damn LEGO and never do anything that dumb again.", "YTA for trying to argue with everyone calling you out in this thread. Why post asking for judgement if you can\u2019t handle it?", "YTA - You're stealing. And while they may not be able to sell those at full price they may have something they do with damaged stuff like offloading them to a liquidator for part of the price.", "YTA. Theft is theft. It doesn\u2019t matter that the boxes were damaged. It doesn\u2019t matter that you weren\u2019t the person that physically took the, from the store.

Why do you think you're not the asshole?", "YTAsshat", "Doesn\u2019t really matter that YTA since you don\u2019t care. But, if you want to drive your car and see your girlfriend, the Legos have to go.", "YTA. You can't just pick up stuff that thiefs drop on their way out of the store, you have to wait til they sell them on ebay.", "YTA it's stolen property.  You knew it was stolen.  You took it.  Not a good move, kid.  Take it back.", "YTA, but ngl a lot of people might have been tempted to do what you did. I get it.\n\nThe problem is you\u2019re potentially on video doing this. You might think you\u2019ve got away with it but you never know. If I were you, I\u2019d just take them back. It gets your dad off your back at least. You can easily frame it to the store as, you saw them drop the Lego, you took it when they weren\u2019t looking and planned to return it once things calmed down. \n\nYes it\u2019s $300 worth of goods you\u2019re missing out on, but honestly it\u2019s not worth the hassle. Take them back and just move on", "YTA You took items that weren't yours. You are a thief. But you are also very naive. Do you realize the police looked at the footage and saw you pick up the items and walk away? It is possible that they already have your license plate number. You risk getting into serious legal trouble. Try to be smarter and listen to your father.", "Even if you think no one saw you, there\u2019s probably CCTV footage. Give it back. A couple of Lego sets are not worth jail time, court or having something like this on your criminal record.", "Are you really asking if you're an asshole for being a thief? In what world are you not an asshole for being a thief?", "YTA and your father is trying to teach you a valuable lesson. Next you'll be taking packages off of porches because they're just sitting there right? An easy way to tell if you are doing something wrong is if you are looking for witnesses. Not a rule across the board obviously.", "Yta. You know right from wrong and honestly it sounds like you don\u2019t care. The only place I see you in a few years from now is jail. What would be really cool is if you dad called the police on you. Teach your ass a lesson.", "This isn\u2019t how life works kid.

Not to mention hypothetically if you're on camera or something taking them the store could get you in trouble, however unlikely it is that they actually decide to pursue.", "Yta. You do realize that you are probably on camera. Heck i have a feeling your dad will probably call the cops as he doesn't want a little thief in his home.

So NTA, take the legos!", "idgaf and I'm not gonna ream you out for taking some free legos from a big retailer during an unexpected moment of opportunity. Minor shit all round. Eating a hamburger is about a million times more immoral.\n\nAnyway this isn't a good crime to do because it's incredibly easy for you to get caught and you probably should return them.

What the OP is admitting to have done IS defined by pretty much every state and federal law as a criminal offense.
