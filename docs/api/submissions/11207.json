She can understand words, but we use sign language to communicate. While she can use her phone or write, obviously she prefers to sign.\n\nThe issue is my girlfriend, Amanda. We've been dating for around 9 months, and introduced our children around 3 months ago. They don't know sign language so communication with Ruby was awkward at first, she hates having to write or use her phone at home. So I taught Amanda some basic signs beforehand, and I've continued teaching her and Mia more in this time. Mia is getting a lot better actually.\n\nBut Amanda has apparently decided it's too hard and refuses to learn any more. She says that it's 'unnecessary' since Ruby can understand her and communicate other ways. While Ruby is usually willing to do that for them, she doesn't enjoy it and finds it frustrating. I told Amanda she's being selfish and lazy. That it's not fair to put all the effort on Ruby. It's one thing if she doesn't get it after years, but it's only been a few months. It's just ridiculous. We got into a fight over it and she basically called me an asshole and said it's not her fault she struggles with it. But that doesn't mean just give up. If she wants to be in our life it's the bare minimum effort to put in. \n\nI clearly think she's just being selfish, while she thinks I'm an asshole and unfair. I vented to my brother and he agreed with Amanda. That I can't force her to learn and not everyone is good with language. And that Ruby doesn't 'need' it and I'm 'coddling her'. I'm honestly still pissed off but I do love Amanda. She's normally thoughtful and kind, and I guess it's possible it's just me being overprotective of Ruby. I think it's a reasonable expectation, but I'm starting to doubt myself", "created_utc": 1677681356, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11f5c7d/aita_calling_my_girlfriend_selfish_for_refusing/", "score": 211, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she's not willing to learn sign for your daughter it means she has no plans of being a big part of her life. Let's say y'all get married one day... she's going to just not communicate with your daughter directly? She's okay with that? You're okay with that? What happens if someone isn't there to translate? What happens if there's an emergency and it's just her and your daughter there and your daughter is trying to explain what she's feeling through sign before passing out?\n\nHow is your daughter going to feel that someone is choosing not to communicate with her? How is she going to feel being excluded from communication at home? How is she going to feel knowing someone thinks she's too difficult to have a simple conversation? That they won't put in the effort to love and care for her enough to sign? How is she feeling right now knowing that you're choosing to be with someone that will never prioritize her? That won't put in the work to learn sign? That doesn't think she's worth the difficulty of learning sign? That you put that relationship over the comfort and family she deserves?\n\nYour daughter deserves better and you really need to consider how this impacts her. Yes, your girlfriend is lazy and selfish, but more importantly, your daughter deserves more than her. She deserves someone that is going to put in the effort to love her enough to learn sign. She deserves someone that will do the hard work and learn sign for her. I'm serious when I say this, break up with your girlfriend. I don't care how much love you think is there, there's a lack of love and care for your daughter and that should never be okay. My sister is deaf and it was hell growing up with one parent who refused to learn sign for her. Don't let your daughter go through that. Don't let her sit with those feelings all by herself. She's going to resent you one day for staying in a relationship with someone that doesn't truly care about her.\n\nEdit: Your brother is an asshole too.", "NTA. This should be a dealbreaker for you.", "NTA. Lots to unpack here. \n\nFirst of all, your daughter uses sign language to communicate and if that is her preferred method of communicating then aligning yourself to that is not coddling at all. I actually wish I could learn how to sign! \n\nIf Amanda really and truly wants a future with you then she needs to understand that you and your kiddo(s) are a packaged deal. She can\u2019t pick and choose which parts of you she wants to embrace and let in. The fact that it\u2019s too hard for her and she hasn\u2019t really tried that hard tells you all you need to know about how she\u2019s going to put effort into your relationship.", "NTA. If it were me and she refused to learn, it would be the end of the relationship. Also any future relationships would start with me explaining my situation and explaining if it gets serious down the road, this is something that will need to be done to stay in my life. My daughter is my priority. If you want to be in my life long term eventually you will need to learn sign language.", "NTA. Anecdotal but my besties husband learned Spanish so he could communicate easily with her non English speaking relatives. IME, you do things that are important to you. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to continue a relationship with someone who put the onus on a child to communicate in a way they aren\u2019t comfortable just so they didn\u2019t have to put forth the effort", "NTA for wanting Amanda to learn. If she doesn\u2019t want to, maybe you need to re evaluate your relationship?", "NTA, do you see a future with a woman who point blank refuses to speak to your daughter?", "NTA, you are standing up for your daughter. It\u2019s one thing if she was working on learning ASL but wasn\u2019t making progress, it\u2019s another to act like it isn\u2019t important. It is like if someone was in a wheelchair but could walk a little with assistance and your girlfriend insisted on a house without a ramp because they aren\u2019t pretty it it\u2019s a pain for her. \n\nWhen you enter a relationship with kids you have to commit to them too. You don\u2019t get to ignore them or don\u2019t care about their needs. Everyone deserves to have their voice be heard. Your daughter\u2019s voice is an expressive language. Body language and signing allows her to be heard. It gives her equal ground. Playing a computer generated voice allows your girlfriend to ignore the emotion behind your daughter\u2019s words. It allows her to interpret your daughter\u2019s word to what ever is convenient for her. \n\nDump her! She isn\u2019t an equal participant to this relationship.", "NTA Whom will you choose? Ruby or Amanda? This is what it comes down to. Amanda does not bother to try to communicate in Ruby\u2019s language. Not one bit. The onus is on Ruby to adapt to Amanda. Is this fair to your daughter? Your girlfriend of only 9 months has shown you that she is not willing to do what it takes to be with you and Ruby, your DAUGHTER! Amanda is selfish! We are not talking about something trivial. We are talking about communication, the primary way we connect with others. By refusing to learn sign language beyond a few basics, Amanda is refusing to communicate and connect with Ruby. Is this the kind of person you want to be with? She\u2019s an AH. Your brother is an AH. If you sell out your daughter to keep Amanda in your life, then you would become the AH too.", "Amanda has the right to say that she does not want to learn ASL, but what kind of a message does it send to Ruby? This is not good for your daughter. Think very hard about which relationship takes prime position in your life.", "NTA. She won\u2019t learn to communicate. What if the two of you have another child who is HOH or mute? What if one of her kids is injured and needs to communicate via ASL? Is she still going to put all of the effort on them? \n\nHard line for me, she\u2019d be gone. Babies can learn to sign, so can a grown person.", "Give Amanda her walking papers. She isn\u2019t the partner for you", "NTA, but you'd be one if you keep dating Amanda.", "NTA. Amanda has a right to not want to learn sign language, but if she's unwilling to put in the effort to communicate with your daughter do you really see a future with her?", "Like you said \" if she wants to be in our lives\": this is your hill to die on ( and i personally agree).\nSo if she refuses i'm not sure there's a futuz for you. This is where you should start jour conversation if you borh want to spend your life together.\nAnd she has a right to refuse\nNah", "NTA. Get rid of the GF. \n\nAnd if it were me with a child who used sign language, any family around the child regularly would also have to learn. It should be a bare minimum for anyone who wants to be in the life of a person who uses it.", "Nta. And this woman has shown you who she is. She won\u2019t put more than a little effort into meeting your child\u2019s needs. Pay attention.", "NTA.\n\nYou are a good parent for calling out your gf\u2019s behavior. Amanda\u2019s already showing you how little she values your daughter. You don\u2019t have to be married to treat someone\u2019s child with respect. Since this is a situation where she\u2019s dating someone with a special needs child, the bare minimum she can do is attempt to establish some sort of bond and try to communicate.\n\nIt seems like she doesn\u2019t take your daughter\u2019s diagnosis seriously since it\u2019s mutism and not deafness. It is wrong of Amanda, as an adult, to try and shift responsibility onto Ruby.\n\nAre you considering a future with this woman? How can she watch over your kid (in the future) if she\u2019s already showing resentment at having to learn sign language?", "NTA you guys are not compatible if she doesn\u2019t think communicating with your daughter is important.", "Amanda doesn\u2019t want to learn to sign because she doesn\u2019t care what your daughter has to say. \u201cRuby doesn\u2019t need it\u201d maybe not, but she DESERVES it. And if you stick with Amanda you\u2019re telling Ruby you agree that Ruby doesn\u2019t deserve to be heard.", "NTA. \n\nIf your girlfriend plans on being your long term partner, she's going to have to step up and learn sign language. If she doesn't, that should be a huge deal breaker for you.", "NTA, but I think your relationship is no longer compatible. Every single day of her life Ruby will be required to use communication skills other than her preferred method of signing simply because there's not going to be enough people she encounters in public able to sign back to her. \n\nDo you think it's fair to have your own life partner refuse to use Ruby's preferred communication? How othering that must feel to Ruby to have someone capable of learning refuse to put in any effort to be able to communicate with her easily.", "\\> If she wants to be in our life, it's the bare minimum effort to put in.\n\nYou've summarized it perfectly.  NTA.", "If you introduce every girl you date for 6 months to your kids, they're likely to see a revolving door of women by the time they're 18. The situation you're currently in is a direct example of it. You didn't know that this woman wasn't compassionate enough to be a safe adult figure for your kid", "NTA you SHOULD be overprotective of your daughter! SHE comes first above everyone else. Your daughter's disabilty deserves accommodations from, at the very least, those who are supposed to love her. This chick is just not right for your family. If you force her to learn, she'll resent you. If you don't, your daughter will resent you. Time to move on.", "NTA. If she even has interest in furthering her relationship with you and actually likes your daughter as well then it's not that hard for her to put in the effort to learn.", "NTA, it's not just her not wanting to learn because it's difficult, but it's how dismissive she was about it. \nI think in this case, it's good you introduced them so early. Otherwise, how deep would you have been before you learned she dissent care enough to try to communicate with your daughter.", "if Amanda is not a child, why is she acting like one?", "NTA if Amanda wants a meaningful relationship with you and your daughter she would put the effort in. She isn\u2019t which speaks volumes about her.", "When you choose to date someone with children, you are also effectively \"dating\" their kids. And she doesn't think that your daughter's communication really matters. Of course you're NTA.", "NTA. This would be a deal breaker for me. I would not want to date someone who is this selfish and inconsiderate of my child\u2019s needs. Ruby deserves better.", "NTA Does Amanda see your relationship as long term? If so, how is this different from her learning any other language to make a child feel more comfortable? While ASL isn\u2019t easy, ( I learned a small amount as a firefighter), to make a kid feel included? Worth it.", "NTA. You're being a good father.\n\n>And that Ruby doesn't 'need' it and I'm 'coddling her'.\n\nIt's her language! If she spoke Polish, you'd want Amanda to learn Polish. Especially since Ruby CANNOT speak English. Amanda and your brother are the AHs here.", "NAH\n\nShe met your children three months ago and struggles to pick up sign language. While you have a right to choose a partner who will meet your daughter on her level, three months is hardly a lot of time. \n\nI think you could have an honest discussion and say \u201cI really love you but I will never propose to and marry someone who won\u2019t learn sign language given my daughter. I understand that our relationship is still fairly new and it\u2019s a lot to ask but I won\u2019t move forward unless that is something you are willing to do.\u201d\n\nThis will set clear expectations and open an honest dialogue. Amanda will have to make her own decision and you can proceed accordingly. I suspect you\u2019ll have your answer within a few months. If I were to guess you will break up but if not that means she stepped up. Good luck!", "NTA the point of dating is usually to eventually get married or long term commitment and if she\u2019s not willing to at least continue to try to learn sign language then how do you think she will act as a step mother/important person in her life. I\u2019d just end it now before the breakup gets harder.", "NTA. I would say this is a good glimpse into your future life if you stay with this woman. Who tells a parent they are coddling their kid because they use sign language? Seriously wtf. That just floored me.\n\nEdit: I hope you and your daughter talk about her being the AH in sign language right in front of her. Better yet, if you break up with her, do it in sign language. \ud83d\ude02", "NTA.  And Amanda has shown you who she is \u2026 she wants the child with a disability to accommodate to her needs.

I'd tell her to start packing if I were you.", "I think if Amanda, or at least anyone reasonable, believed that if your relationship was serious and capable of going somewhere, she would understand that your children are your first priority (should be) and that she would need to learn to communicate effectively with Ruby both as a sign of respect and simple practicality.  On the other hand, if she doesn't feel like this is a serious relationship or has a real future to it, why bother?\n\nI think you should have a serious conversation with Amanda about your relationships future.  Her excuses of \"Ruby doesn't need it\" and \"you're coddling her\" sounds like BS for laziness and/or not respecting any of your kids.  If she really isn't interested in going there, its time to cut your losses and move on.\n\nAn employer would be legally required to be more accommodating of Ruby's disability than Amanda has been and while Ruby should be capable of communicating with random strangers who don't know sign, Amanda isn't a random stranger.", "Nta, and this is a hill I would die on.

No, you\u2019re not being unreasonable at all.  You aren\u2019t coddling Ruby, either.  You were right before - learning to communicate with Ruby is the bare minimum for this relationship to move forward.

It\u2019s only been 9 months. Learning a new language - including sign language - is hard and time consuming.

The fact she refuses to learn shows she's not a long-time good choice.\n\nBreak up gently, and put that up front in your dating profile that you know ASL, it may get a better quality person for you who can communicate with your daughter.", "Definitely NOT the asshole! Not at all. She is! Break up with her. \ud83d\ude44", "NTA I would never date or marry someone who wasn't willing to put in the time to learn to communicate with my child.", "NTA. You know the kind of home you want your daughter raised in. Does your gf fit into that image?", "I haven't been around mute people much to know really, but it does sound like a reasonable expectation. At least to try to learn, nobody expects her to understand it overnight. If she's serious about being with you, she'll be a big part of your daughter's life and it'll mean a lot to her; it does sound like the greatest gift she could give her.  \nHowever, it's true that not all people are good with languages, or even learning new things in general. So maybe you shouldn't put it as \"you NEED to learn this\".

I started learning ASL at the beginning of February for my job and I\u2019m literally already communicating effectively. It\u2019s a basic sign (heh) of respect to make the attempts to learn.

It\u2019s also frustrating for your daughter to not be able to communicate in the way she prefers. \nGirlfriend should just try a little harder, and watch a couple YouTube videos.", "NTA\n\nLet's put it this way.  What if you and your daughter spoke a foreign language?  And, in this analogy, your daughter literally could not speak English (as she's mute).  Would you be an AH for asking your girlfriend to learn at least some familiarity with your language?\n\nWhile your brother is right that you can't force Amanda to learn, it will make things very difficult for Ruby when she can't communicate her needs back to her.   Even though I'm sure Ruby perfectly understands what you say (as you said she's not deaf but mute) a conversation needs to be **two way**.  Ruby can't communicate back in any other way.\n\nSo I'd say Amanda is absolutely the AH here as is your brother.  And you need to break up with Amanda, since your daughter's needs come first.  And one is **parents who can understand her communication back to them.**", "NTA it seems crazy to tell people in the internet to break up, but how is there any future in this relationship? How will you bond the three of you together if your partner never understands?

Not to mention she should want to learn from an emotional stand point.", "NTA.  What line of work if your GF in?  Maybe you can convince her that knowing sign language is good for her career and turn it into a win/win.

Also, making an effort to communicate isn\u2019t coddling so much as being a nurturing dad.\n\nEither way, it is ok for the girlfriend not to want to learn ASL.

You've only been together 9 months, many couples wait until a year to meet the kids.\n\nRuby is right to not want to have to talk via phone at home, but learning a whole new language less than a year into a relationship is a massive time commitment.

She can understand words, but we use sign language to communicate. While she can use her phone or write, obviously she prefers to sign.\n\nThe issue is my girlfriend, Amanda. We've been dating for around 9 months, and introduced our children around 3 months ago.

So I taught Amanda some basic signs beforehand, and I've continued teaching her and Mia more in this time. Mia is getting a lot better actually.\n\nBut Amanda has apparently decided it's too hard and refuses to learn any more. She says that it's 'unnecessary' since Ruby can understand her and communicate other ways. While Ruby is usually willing to do that for them, she doesn't enjoy it and finds it frustrating. I told Amanda she's being selfish and lazy. That it's not fair to put all the effort on Ruby. It's one thing if she doesn't get it after years, but it's only been a few months. It's just ridiculous.

If she wants to be in our life it's the bare minimum effort to put in. \n\nI clearly think she's just being selfish, while she thinks I'm an asshole and unfair. I vented to my brother and he agreed with Amanda. That I can't force her to learn and that Ruby doesn't 'need' it and I'm 'coddling her'. I'm honestly still pissed off but I do love Amanda. She's normally thoughtful and kind, and I guess it's possible it's just me being overprotective of Ruby.

She's never been like this before so it took me by surprise", "This. As a parent it's gotta be.", "It can be a dealbreaker for OP, but he doesn't get to decide Amanda's priorities and then call her lazy because hers don't line up.  I'd consider OP the asshole here.", "Definitely. Is the OP TA for not communicating that that is a dealbreaker in the first few dates?  Most definitely", "It's not that she refuses, they do have a way to talk. It's just not as preferred for her. Either way I think it's wrong. I was already thinking was worth ending it, it's just my brother and her got in my head and I worried I was crazy", "I think typically Reddit is fast to the breakup solution but in this case I agree.

Are you really going to allow your daughter to be raised with someone who puts the labour in a child, whines and blames a child, says giving your daughter an easy way to communicate is (Which everyone else gets) is \u201ccoddling her\u201d. \n\nAnd tell me, do you think that someone who talks that way about your child cares about her? Respects her? Because as a disabled adult what I hear in what your gf says is ableist condescension and annoyance at your child. And I\u2019ll bet you $50 she blames your child for all the conflict this is causing in your relationship. \n\nCan you trust her to be alone with Ruby for extended periods? Can you trust her to communicate with her and listen to her needs? Can you trust her to not treat her like an annoyance who is being coddled? Because based on what you wrote here I sue af wouldn\u2019t. \n\nAnd if all that is true is there even a future for you? How much should Ruby pay because you like this woman?\n\nPs. To anyone who says she didn\u2019t NEED it and you are cuddling her reply with: you don\u2019t NEED elevators or escalators\u2026 do you take the stairs every time?

Communication is important and she\u2019s made no effort to learn to sign with Ruby. It would absolutely be frustrating for anyone to have to use a \u201ctranslator\u201d all day.

I'd also add someone besides him should be teaching her.

Just wanted to add a note about the brother's comment that bugged me:\n\nMost of the world is hearing and speaking, so they don't know any sign language. It's fair to assume that most of the time, Ruby has to manage communicating with others in ways that are difficult and frustrating for her. Her home is her comfort zone. Where she can communicate with her family (OP) in a way that is comfortable to her. That's not coddling, that's giving her a place to relax and not accomodate the entire world to her disability.\n\nIf Amanda and OP get married, and Amanda - who will become Ruby's stepmom and live with her in the same house - refuses to learn sign language, Ruby's home will become another place where she has to deal with the difficulties of being mute. She deserves to be comfortable in her own home.", "I'm guessing Mia is the girlfriends child", "Absolutely, this.

Deaf and mute folks deal with this all the time. Their opportunities to communicate in their language are so limited so of course OP wants his daughter to have that comfort in her own home. He\u2019s not expecting Gf to learn overnight, he just wants her to keep trying.", "It is not unreasonable to have some expectation, once you introduce your children to your partner, that your partner may well be a part of their lives for a significant enough chunk of time.  In that case, yes, it's in everyone's interest to learn how to communicate.  I was born Deaf and grew up in a family with four other people - only two of whom bothered to learn functional sign language.  It's still, somehow, a shock to the others that I no longer associate with them now, after years of trying to explain to them.  \n\nThe girlfriend here is nine months into a relationship, and has tried a bit. It's not easy to learn sign language \"on your own\", but it's not unreasonable to ask her to.  If anything, the OP can now take it as a lesson that this particular person is not a good fit for his family and move on to look for someone more understanding.", "Why?", "If she\u2019s acting like this after only 9 months it\u2019s a huge red flag.", "Your brother is an AH too. Asking for someone that I'm guessing you might see a future with to learn how to best communicate with your daughter is not coddling her and she does in fact NEED to be able to communicate but more importantly in a manner she feels most comfortable with (your daughter I mean). Asking a CHILD to accommodate an adult is honestly one of the more entitled things I've heard. The fact that an adult is saying \"This is to hard for me, do it how I want to\" is troubling and something you should really consider before taking any further steps with Amanda.", "So what is her plan? She never plans to be able to have a normal conversation with her without* the use of a phone with her? Personally, I would love to learn ASL, however, I do not know any who uses it.", "I personally think sign language is beautiful, and it's a shame she doesn't want to learn. I guess this hinges on how long you've been going out and how serious this is. Does she see this as a long term thing? If yes, then this is not a good sign for the future- why wouldn't you make every effort to communicate with a kid that's going to be in your life?\n\nThe other possibility is that she's kinda got one foot in, one foot out. Maybe she's nervous about taking on two kids? \n\nThere's something behind this behaviour.", "Does your brother want to date Amanda? There is no other reason for him to take her side over yours and his niece. Break up with Amanda. She is selfish and entitled and childish. You don\u2019t want that kind of person around your child.", "OP, you are NTA, Amanda is and frankly so is your brother for agreeing with her. You are right, it IS the bare minimum to learn sign language for your daughter. You are not coddling your daughter, they are rude and inconsiderate towards her and her needs.\n\nI have a friend (Swedish) who is in a relationship with a woman who is half Swedish, half Italian. Her Italian family does understand english, but my friend is learning Italian so he can communicate better with her relatives, these are his reasons why: 1. It makes it easier for them to talk to him since they aren't 100% comfortable speaking english 2. It shows he is serious about his commitment to his girlfriend, and 3. why the heck not?\n\nIn all honestly, this should be a deal breaker for you. If Amanda isn't willing to learn sign language so she can communicate with your daughter, she had to go.", "I wonder how your brother is as an uncle.

You and your daughter deserve better.", "Your brother is right, you can\u2019t force her to learn, but her unwillingness and disinterest says plenty. So what does it mean if you stay together forever? I\u2019m sorry, relationships are hard enough when you have a young one and her stance is a big red flag to me.", "Don't doubt yourself.\n\nAmanda is perfectly happy in a relationship with your daughter where only she communicates.  Does that sound healthy in the slightest? \n\nSure, there is written communication, but we all know that will get too hard over time as well, don't we?", "ESH", "I totally agree. I was beginning to feel like I\u2019m going crazy.", "If she is unwilling to make the effort to accommodate a child she would be a parental figure too\u2026 she\u2019s not the right parental figure for that child. It\u2019s a very reasonable accommodation and it\u2019s a sign of respect. I don\u2019t think calling her selfish and lazy is helpful - learning new languages can be very hard for certain people as they can be very easy for others - but it just isn\u2019t a good fit.", ">I clearly think she's just being selfish, while she thinks I'm an asshole and unfair. I vented to my brother and he agreed with Amanda. That I can't force her to learn and not everyone is good with language. And that Ruby doesn't 'need' it and I'm 'coddling her'. I'm honestly still pissed off but I do love Amanda. She's normally thoughtful and kind, and I guess it's possible it's just me being overprotective of Ruby. I think it's a reasonable expectation, but I'm starting to doubt myself\n\nYou're not crazy. And this is a red flag for your brother, too. I hope he has learned to sign so he can communicate with your daughter too. Maybe this is this way of excusing his own lack of engagement?", "Amanda\u2019s preferences do not matter.  She has only been dating you for 9 months, and met your child 3 months ago.", "Ask your daughter what she thinks", "Coddling has a purposely negative connotation to it but I know what you're saying and I agree.", "Thank you. I think people get weird pretty quick here when it comes to ableism.

It deserves to be upvoted.", "Our relationships when we have children is not just our relationship. \nThe children become attached and have a relationship (hopefully a positive one) too.\nIf the adult relationship ends the adult moves on... kids not so much.\nIt can be painful, traumatic and set them up on how they handle future relationships in their lives. \nIt's not only about the adults. \nWe need to remember children also become attached as well.\nI'm not judging however I've lived long enough to see the wreckage via others experiences.", "Imo longer than that, especially when the kids were that young. There isn\u2019t a one size fits all answer but I personally would\u2019ve gone at least a year.

I'm not even saying anything bad about Ruby, but preteens are weird about their privacy and don't want their parents knowing if they're talking to anyone.\n\n\nNTA.

Man calls names at woman he has been dating for 9 months because she won't learn a new language", "Learn? Unreasonable. Make an effort? Reasonable. \n\nOnce you introduce each other to the kids, it\u2019s serious (or should be). Kids are a package deal, and if Amanda is going to stick around, she will need to live up to that. If she\u2019s not serious enough about this relationship to be thinking about the long term, she should never have agreed to meet the kid. Since she did, and all of them are now in a relationship, she should be trying to fit all of them into her life. \n\nAgain, I understand if she\u2019s not good at ASL.

Dozens!", "That is exactly what it is", "I agree, in that I think he can't demand she learns it. But if she were my daughter it would be a dealbreaker if she refuses to learn full stop. It isn't comparable to learning Spanish or English, because in that case you could argue the child could also learn the other language. In this case, the daughter cannot suddenly learn to speak. She is mute. If the girlfriend refuses to learn the language at all in the future, she is going to struggle to fully communicate with his daughter if the relationship develops.", "Come on people, this isn\u2019t even what OP\u2019s asking about. It sounds like OP has a decent head on their shoulders, I don\u2019t think we need to judge on every little thing, especially as it doesn\u2019t really relate to the question. NTA, by the way.

The girlfriend was a bit naive, because she agreed to try and then is now backing down saying it's too much/too difficult.
