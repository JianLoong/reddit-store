She can understand words, but we use sign language to communicate. While she can use her phone or write, obviously she prefers to sign.\n\nThe issue is my girlfriend, Amanda. We've been dating for around 9 months, and introduced our children around 3 months ago. They don't know sign language so communication with Ruby was awkward at first, she hates having to write or use her phone at home. So I taught Amanda some basic signs beforehand, and I've continued teaching her and Mia more in this time. Mia is getting a lot better actually.\n\nBut Amanda has apparently decided it's too hard and refuses to learn any more. She says that it's 'unnecessary' since Ruby can understand her and communicate other ways. While Ruby is usually willing to do that for them, she doesn't enjoy it and finds it frustrating. I told Amanda she's being selfish and lazy. That it's not fair to put all the effort on Ruby. It's one thing if she doesn't get it after years, but it's only been a few months. It's just ridiculous. We got into a fight over it and she basically called me an asshole and said it's not her fault she struggles with it. But that doesn't mean just give up. If she wants to be in our life it's the bare minimum effort to put in. \n\nI clearly think she's just being selfish, while she thinks I'm an asshole and unfair. I vented to my brother and he agreed with Amanda. That I can't force her to learn and not everyone is good with language. And that Ruby doesn't 'need' it and I'm 'coddling her'. I'm honestly still pissed off but I do love Amanda. She's normally thoughtful and kind, and I guess it's possible it's just me being overprotective of Ruby. I think it's a reasonable expectation, but I'm starting to doubt myself", "created_utc": 1677681356, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11f5c7d/aita_calling_my_girlfriend_selfish_for_refusing/", "score": 6111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she's not willing to learn sign for your daughter it means she has no plans of being a big part of her life. Let's say y'all get married one day... she's going to just not communicate with your daughter directly? She's okay with that? You're okay with that? What happens if someone isn't there to translate? What happens if there's an emergency and it's just her and your daughter there and your daughter is trying to explain what she's feeling through sign before passing out?\n\nHow is your daughter going to feel that someone is choosing not to communicate with her? How is she going to feel being excluded from communication at home? How is she going to feel knowing someone thinks she's too difficult to have a simple conversation? That they won't put in the effort to love and care for her enough to sign? How is she feeling right now knowing that you're choosing to be with someone that will never prioritize her? That won't put in the work to learn sign? That doesn't think she's worth the difficulty of learning sign? That you put that relationship over the comfort and family she deserves?\n\nYour daughter deserves better and you really need to consider how this impacts her. Yes, your girlfriend is lazy and selfish, but more importantly, your daughter deserves more than her. She deserves someone that is going to put in the effort to love her enough to learn sign. She deserves someone that will do the hard work and learn sign for her. I'm serious when I say this, break up with your girlfriend. I don't care how much love you think is there, there's a lack of love and care for your daughter and that should never be okay. My sister is deaf and it was hell growing up with one parent who refused to learn sign for her. Don't let your daughter go through that. Don't let her sit with those feelings all by herself. She's going to resent you one day for staying in a relationship with someone that doesn't truly care about her.\n\nEdit: Your brother is an asshole too.", "NTA. This should be a dealbreaker for you.", "NTA. Lots to unpack here. \n\nFirst of all, your daughter uses sign language to communicate and if that is her preferred method of communicating then aligning yourself to that is not coddling at all. I actually wish I could learn how to sign! \n\nIf Amanda really and truly wants a future with you then she needs to understand that you and your kiddo(s) are a packaged deal. She can\u2019t pick and choose which parts of you she wants to embrace and let in. The fact that it\u2019s too hard for her and she hasn\u2019t really tried that hard tells you all you need to know about how she\u2019s going to put effort into your relationship.", "NTA. If it were me and she refused to learn, it would be the end of the relationship. Also any future relationships would start with me explaining my situation and explaining if it gets serious down the road, this is something that will need to be done to stay in my life. My daughter is my priority. If you want to be in my life long term eventually you will need to learn sign language.", "NTA. Anecdotal but my besties husband learned Spanish so he could communicate easily with her non English speaking relatives. IME, you do things that are important to you. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to continue a relationship with someone who put the onus on a child to communicate in a way they aren\u2019t comfortable just so they didn\u2019t have to put forth the effort", "NTA for wanting Amanda to learn. If she doesn\u2019t want to, maybe you need to re evaluate your relationship?", "NTA, do you see a future with a woman who point blank refuses to speak to your daughter?", "NTA, you are standing up for your daughter. It\u2019s one thing if she was working on learning ASL but wasn\u2019t making progress, it\u2019s another to act like it isn\u2019t important. It is like if someone was in a wheelchair but could walk a little with assistance and your girlfriend insisted on a house without a ramp because they aren\u2019t pretty it it\u2019s a pain for her. \n\nWhen you enter a relationship with kids you have to commit to them too. You don\u2019t get to ignore them or don\u2019t care about their needs. Everyone deserves to have their voice be heard. Your daughter\u2019s voice is an expressive language. Body language and signing allows her to be heard. It gives her equal ground. Playing a computer generated voice allows your girlfriend to ignore the emotion behind your daughter\u2019s words. It allows her to interpret your daughter\u2019s word to what ever is convenient for her. \n\nDump her! She isn\u2019t an equal participant to this relationship.", "NTA Whom will you choose? Ruby or Amanda? This is what it comes down to. Amanda does not bother to try to communicate in Ruby\u2019s language. Not one bit. The onus is on Ruby to adapt to Amanda. Is this fair to your daughter? Your girlfriend of only 9 months has shown you that she is not willing to do what it takes to be with you and Ruby, your DAUGHTER! Amanda is selfish! We are not talking about something trivial. We are talking about communication, the primary way we connect with others. By refusing to learn sign language beyond a few basics, Amanda is refusing to communicate and connect with Ruby. Is this the kind of person you want to be with? She\u2019s an AH. Your brother is an AH. If you sell out your daughter to keep Amanda in your life, then you would become the AH too.", "Amanda has the right to say that she does not want to learn ASL, but what kind of a message does it send to Ruby? This is not good for your daughter. Think very hard about which relationship takes prime position in your life.", "NTA. She won\u2019t learn to communicate. What if the two of you have another child who is HOH or mute? What if one of her kids is injured and needs to communicate via ASL? Is she still going to put all of the effort on them? \n\nHard line for me, she\u2019d be gone. Babies can learn to sign, so can a grown person.", "Give Amanda her walking papers. She isn\u2019t the partner for you", "NTA, but you'd be one if you keep dating Amanda.", "NTA. Amanda has a right to not want to learn sign language, but if she's unwilling to put in the effort to communicate with your daughter do you really see a future with her?", "Like you said \" if she wants to be in our lives\": this is your hill to die on ( and i personally agree).\nSo if she refuses i'm not sure there's a futuz for you. This is where you should start jour conversation if you borh want to spend your life together.\nAnd she has a right to refuse\nNah", "NTA. Get rid of the GF. \n\nAnd if it were me with a child who used sign language, any family around the child regularly would also have to learn. It should be a bare minimum for anyone who wants to be in the life of a person who uses it.", "Nta. And this woman has shown you who she is. She won\u2019t put more than a little effort into meeting your child\u2019s needs. Pay attention.", "NTA.\n\nYou are a good parent for calling out your gf\u2019s behavior. Amanda\u2019s already showing you how little she values your daughter. You don\u2019t have to be married to treat someone\u2019s child with respect. Since this is a situation where she\u2019s dating someone with a special needs child, the bare minimum she can do is attempt to establish some sort of bond and try to communicate.\n\nIt seems like she doesn\u2019t take your daughter\u2019s diagnosis seriously since it\u2019s mutism and not deafness. It is wrong of Amanda, as an adult, to try and shift responsibility onto Ruby.\n\nAre you considering a future with this woman? How can she watch over your kid (in the future) if she\u2019s already showing resentment at having to learn sign language?", "NTA you guys are not compatible if she doesn\u2019t think communicating with your daughter is important.", "Amanda doesn\u2019t want to learn to sign because she doesn\u2019t care what your daughter has to say. \u201cRuby doesn\u2019t need it\u201d maybe not, but she DESERVES it. And if you stick with Amanda you\u2019re telling Ruby you agree that Ruby doesn\u2019t deserve to be heard.", "NTA. \n\nIf your girlfriend plans on being your long term partner, she's going to have to step up and learn sign language. If she doesn't, that should be a huge deal breaker for you.", "NTA, but I think your relationship is no longer compatible. Every single day of her life Ruby will be required to use communication skills other than her preferred method of signing simply because there's not going to be enough people she encounters in public able to sign back to her. \n\nDo you think it's fair to have your own life partner refuse to use Ruby's preferred communication? How othering that must feel to Ruby to have someone capable of learning refuse to put in any effort to be able to communicate with her easily.", "\\> If she wants to be in our life, it's the bare minimum effort to put in.\n\nYou've summarized it perfectly.  NTA.", "If you introduce every girl you date for 6 months to your kids, they're likely to see a revolving door of women by the time they're 18. The situation you're currently in is a direct example of it. You didn't know that this woman wasn't compassionate enough to be a safe adult figure for your kid", "NTA you SHOULD be overprotective of your daughter! SHE comes first above everyone else. Your daughter's disabilty deserves accommodations from, at the very least, those who are supposed to love her. This chick is just not right for your family. If you force her to learn, she'll resent you. If you don't, your daughter will resent you. Time to move on.", "NTA. If she even has interest in furthering her relationship with you and actually likes your daughter as well then it's not that hard for her to put in the effort to learn.", "NTA, it's not just her not wanting to learn because it's difficult, but it's how dismissive she was about it. \nI think in this case, it's good you introduced them so early. Otherwise, how deep would you have been before you learned she dissent care enough to try to communicate with your daughter.", "if Amanda is not a child, why is she acting like one?", "NTA if Amanda wants a meaningful relationship with you and your daughter she would put the effort in. She isn\u2019t which speaks volumes about her.", "When you choose to date someone with children, you are also effectively \"dating\" their kids. And she doesn't think that your daughter's communication really matters. Of course you're NTA.", "NTA. This would be a deal breaker for me. I would not want to date someone who is this selfish and inconsiderate of my child\u2019s needs. Ruby deserves better.", "NTA Does Amanda see your relationship as long term? If so, how is this different from her learning any other language to make a child feel more comfortable? While ASL isn\u2019t easy, ( I learned a small amount as a firefighter), to make a kid feel included? Worth it.", "NTA. You're being a good father.\n\n>And that Ruby doesn't 'need' it and I'm 'coddling her'.\n\nIt's her language! If she spoke Polish, you'd want Amanda to learn Polish. Especially since Ruby CANNOT speak English. Amanda and your brother are the AHs here.", "NAH\n\nShe met your children three months ago and struggles to pick up sign language. While you have a right to choose a partner who will meet your daughter on her level, three months is hardly a lot of time. \n\nI think you could have an honest discussion and say \u201cI really love you but I will never propose to and marry someone who won\u2019t learn sign language given my daughter. I understand that our relationship is still fairly new and it\u2019s a lot to ask but I won\u2019t move forward unless that is something you are willing to do.\u201d\n\nThis will set clear expectations and open an honest dialogue. Amanda will have to make her own decision and you can proceed accordingly. I suspect you\u2019ll have your answer within a few months. If I were to guess you will break up but if not that means she stepped up. Good luck!", "NTA the point of dating is usually to eventually get married or long term commitment and if she\u2019s not willing to at least continue to try to learn sign language then how do you think she will act as a step mother/important person in her life. I\u2019d just end it now before the breakup gets harder.", "NTA. I would say this is a good glimpse into your future life if you stay with this woman. Who tells a parent they are coddling their kid because they use sign language? Seriously wtf. That just floored me.\n\nEdit: I hope you and your daughter talk about her being the AH in sign language right in front of her. Better yet, if you break up with her, do it in sign language. \ud83d\ude02", "NTA.  And Amanda has shown you who she is \u2026 she wants the child with a disability to accommodate to her needs.

I'd tell her to start packing if I were you.", "I think if Amanda, or at least anyone reasonable, believed that if your relationship was serious and capable of going somewhere, she would understand that your children are your first priority (should be) and that she would need to learn to communicate effectively with Ruby both as a sign of respect and simple practicality.  On the other hand, if she doesn't feel like this is a serious relationship or has a real future to it, why bother?\n\nI think you should have a serious conversation with Amanda about your relationships future.  Her excuses of \"Ruby doesn't need it\" and \"you're coddling her\" sounds like BS for laziness and/or not respecting any of your kids.  If she really isn't interested in going there, its time to cut your losses and move on.\n\nAn employer would be legally required to be more accommodating of Ruby's disability than Amanda has been and while Ruby should be capable of communicating with random strangers who don't know sign, Amanda isn't a random stranger.", "Nta, and this is a hill I would die on.

No, you\u2019re not being unreasonable at all.  You aren\u2019t coddling Ruby, either.  You were right before - learning to communicate with Ruby is the bare minimum for this relationship to move forward.

It\u2019s only been 9 months. Learning a new language - including sign language - is hard and time consuming.

The fact she refuses to learn shows she's not a long-time good choice.\n\nBreak up gently, and put that up front in your dating profile that you know ASL, it may get a better quality person for you who can communicate with your daughter.", "Definitely NOT the asshole! Not at all. She is! Break up with her. \ud83d\ude44", "NTA I would never date or marry someone who wasn't willing to put in the time to learn to communicate with my child.", "NTA. You know the kind of home you want your daughter raised in. Does your gf fit into that image?", "I haven't been around mute people much to know really, but it does sound like a reasonable expectation. At least to try to learn, nobody expects her to understand it overnight. If she's serious about being with you, she'll be a big part of your daughter's life and it'll mean a lot to her; it does sound like the greatest gift she could give her.  \nHowever, it's true that not all people are good with languages, or even learning new things in general. So maybe you shouldn't put it as \"you NEED to learn this\".

I started learning ASL at the beginning of February for my job and I\u2019m literally already communicating effectively. It\u2019s a basic sign (heh) of respect to make the attempts to learn.

It\u2019s also frustrating for your daughter to not be able to communicate in the way she prefers. \nGirlfriend should just try a little harder, and watch a couple YouTube videos.", "NTA\n\nLet's put it this way.  What if you and your daughter spoke a foreign language?  And, in this analogy, your daughter literally could not speak English (as she's mute).  Would you be an AH for asking your girlfriend to learn at least some familiarity with your language?\n\nWhile your brother is right that you can't force Amanda to learn, it will make things very difficult for Ruby when she can't communicate her needs back to her.   Even though I'm sure Ruby perfectly understands what you say (as you said she's not deaf but mute) a conversation needs to be **two way**.  Ruby can't communicate back in any other way.\n\nSo I'd say Amanda is absolutely the AH here as is your brother.  And you need to break up with Amanda, since your daughter's needs come first.  And one is **parents who can understand her communication back to them.**", "NTA it seems crazy to tell people in the internet to break up, but how is there any future in this relationship? How will you bond the three of you together if your partner never understands?

Maybe you can convince her that knowing sign language is good for her career and turn it into a win/win.

You've only been together 9 months, many couples wait until a year to meet the kids.\n\nRuby is right to not want to have to talk via phone at home, but learning a whole new language less than a year into a relationship is a massive time commitment.

She can understand words, but we use sign language to communicate. While she can use her phone or write, obviously she prefers to sign.\n\nThe issue is my girlfriend, Amanda. We've been dating for around 9 months, and introduced our children around 3 months ago.

So I taught Amanda some basic signs beforehand, and I've continued teaching her and Mia more in this time. Mia is getting a lot better actually.\n\nBut Amanda has apparently decided it's too hard and refuses to learn any more. She says that it's 'unnecessary' since Ruby can understand her and communicate other ways. While Ruby is usually willing to do that for them, she doesn't enjoy it and finds it frustrating. I told Amanda she's being selfish and lazy. That it's not fair to put all the effort on Ruby. It's one thing if she doesn't get it after years, but it's only been a few months. It's just ridiculous.

If she wants to be in our life it's the bare minimum effort to put in. \n\nI clearly think she's just being selfish, while she thinks I'm an asshole and unfair. I vented to my brother and he agreed with Amanda. That I can't force her to learn and that Ruby doesn't 'need' it and I'm 'coddling her'. I'm honestly still pissed off but I do love Amanda. She's normally thoughtful and kind, and I guess it's possible it's just me being overprotective of Ruby.

It takes adults longer to learn a language than a child hence why her 7 year old daughter is picking it up easily. \n\nShe has only been learning for 3 months how to sign. You aren't going to perfect it quickly as an adult in 3 months. I do have a feeling Amanda is feeling a lot of pressure and feeling stressed to try to learn it and perfect it.

So, she had some under her belt already and first meeting wasn't awkward. She might have been feeling she has to play catch up and then just got overwhelmed. On top of that if she not using it everyday, all day, it takes longer to learn the language and feel much harder to learn it.

I told Amanda she's being selfish and lazy. That it's not fair to put all the effort on Ruby. It's one thing if she doesn't get it after years, but it's only been a few months. It's just ridiculous. We got into a fight over it and she basically called me an asshole and said it's not her fault she struggles with it. But that doesn't mean just give up.

I can turn that around and say the same about you and Ruby. Both of you are selfish to expect someone to learn a language for you guys. Ruby can be classified as lazy also for not wanting to communicate in another way when she is able to.  On top of that she has said it is hard and she struggles learning it that doesn't make her selfish and lazy to stop it. \n\nYou say it isn't fair to put all the effort on Ruby but it isn't fair either to put all the effort on Amanda to learn a whole new language.

I even cried sometimes because I felt stupid for taking so long to learn something and feeling like I was always messing up. And my degree is in languages, I can't even think if someone had difficulty in this subject. He never pressured me or made me feel this way but the situation in itself and lack of communication lead to this. I ended up asking him to stop teaching me altogether and we don't talk about it for a few weeks. In these weeks I tried online and learning on my own, slowly and then I tried talking to him and he would answer. We also started seeing some movies/series in his language and it helped a lot. All this to say, sometimes things take time and people get frustrated, as long as they feel like they want to learn (and as she tried in the beginning I may see hope) she can do it, but it's different for everyone.\n\nI think the relationship is still new.

But you really shouldn't let someone who is your partner treat your child this way. \n\nNot learning how to communicate properly with your child or step child is cruel.", "Why should the child have to struggle so that the adult does not? NTA OP but you will be if you allow this behavior to continue and stay with Amanda.", "You know that texting and using facial/body language/ emotional expressions while communicating in ASL aren\u2019t the same thing. Amanda doesn\u2019t care and that\u2019s concerning.", "I completely agree with this. If she decides to continue learning it would be best to get a 3rd party in. I love my wife but our differing learning styles/processing habits would put us at each other's throats if we had to learn/teach a continuous learning complicated subject to the other.", "Yep. Additionally, the daughter will unfortunately need to get used to communicating in other means than sign language. While I think those closest to her (family, best friends, future partners) should learn sign language and she may be able to attend sign language schools for now, one day she\u2019ll be interacting with others outside of her closest sphere or the mute/deaf community that won\u2019t know or be willing to learn sign language. \n\nI don\u2019t think dad\u2019s girlfriend of 9 months (who\u2019s known you for 3 months) counts as people closest to her so I don\u2019t personally think the gf is an AH, nor is the dad one for wanting to protect his daughter, but depending on age, pushing his daughter beyond her comfort zone here isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing.\n\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve also seen mute folks interact with the world in a very typical way - including a Starbucks barista who wrote down her responses on a chalkboard while at work. The more ways you can interact with the world, the more typical your life will be able to be. It may not be fair but will likely be an easier life if she has more avenues of communication she\u2019s comfortable with. Saying all of this as a neurodivergent person who understands an ideal world would not involve otherly abled people making concessions but that we don\u2019t live in an ideal world and I want to be able to engage with the world we do have as much as possible. His daughter may decide she doesn\u2019t want to engage with the world in a typical way, but she should at least have the option.", "I\u2019ve been learning Spanish for almost two years as an adult. I still am not confident to hold a conversation. It\u2019s really not as simple as OP is making it out to be especially after only 3 months.", "Yeah holy crap. All the NTA's are acting like this is some long term relationship. He's been pushing her to learn since before the 6 month mark in their relationship. I can't imagine doing anything that big for someone I'd been only dating 6 months? It probably takes up a lot of their dating time, and instead of getting to know each other well, and letting that relationship and desire to learn, develop naturally, OP is being pushy. \n\nIf he wanted someone to know sign this early in the game he should have been seeking that out specifically from the get go with very clear expectations. The relationship hasn't even made it to a year yet. Wtaf lol.", "Yep. This is at least an hour a day of homework. It\u2019s a lot to ask.", "I don't think OP was expecting her to pick up ASL in three months. However, her deciding after three months that she isn't going to put anymore effort into learning ASL is a huge red flag.", "Yeah, that would be a huge red flag for me. We don\u2019t know how serious the relationship is, and OP could be scaring Amanda with how fast and how serious he is about this. Only nine months in, three months in with the kids, and he\u2019s on her case about sign language already?

All the same things as any other kid.", "Joining families that have disabled children always requires more effort to put in. I get really tired of people thinking they should not have to be inconvenienced for a disabled person to have a decent quality of life.

She just doesn't want to continue. And they've been dating for 9 months only. Might i add. Even without kids or anything else. I won't be learning a new language for someone i dated for 9 months.", "IMO expecting the effort of learning a language after only 9 months together is unreasonable.", "It\u2019s the fact she isn\u2019t willing to do the work when it\u2019s hard that makes me shake her head.

Learning spanish as a russian student would be much harder. Not all languages are the same level of tricky and since sign language uses a whole different media and/or structure (not sure on this one but I've heard people say it), it would be definitely tricky to learn.", "Probably to skilled people sign language is no hassle but the average Joe can't pick it up in a manner of days", "I can\u2019t imagine this attitude being consistent with any person I\u2019d want to build my life with. \n\nIt might be challenging.

If she won't even try to communicate easily with your daughter this early, what else is she going to give up on? She's not stepparent material in my eyes.", "I remember when I first got together with my husband his mom is Swiss German, but we all speak English together obviously but his grandma at the time while she was fluent in English was having a mental decline and would default to Swiss German often and get a blank look when I talked to her in English so I learnt a little bit enough to have a little chat with her when she couldn't seem to find her English and she loved it.\n\n I don't see why ops gf thinks not learning sign isn't an issue is a major one, and it is very exclusionary, I think op needs to realise now that this will get much much worse if she moves in with them too, she WILL straight up ignore his kid.", "It feels like Amanda is setting up to alienate Ruby.

I keep meaning to, and I probally would have if I had stayed in my first middle school. I left because others where bullying me, but a good amount of people where nice too. One of them was deaf. Since most people diidn't know sing launguage, she had an interpreter (she could understand lips (IIRC), but she couldn't understand people not looking at her, even if she could read lips).\n\nEven though she had an interpreter, I always made a point to say high *both* to the interpreter and her. I would smile and wave (and sometimes say hi) While not much, I like to think it made her happier. I do know that she was one of the few who actually was kind of sad to see me go. So...", "Oh I watched that in band in high school, such a wonderful movie!", "I like this reply. I'm willing to say he is TA for name calling as well.

Learning thousands of word-signs could be intimidating. Learning 26 signs plus whatever additional handfuls of daily-life-use word-signs can be acquired over time (names, dinner, hurry, help, love you, etc.) is a much less scary process which accomplishes the same goal of communicating. \n \nIn your shoes, OP, I might present this alphabet suggestion to Amanda as a \u201clast chance, or else this is a dealbreaker for me\u201d option. As an English speaker who lived abroad and has Japanese-only-speaking in-laws, I CAN speak but in our family group-texts I can\u2019t consistently write kanji (word pictures), only the hiragana and katakana alphabets. Still, I\u2019m making the effort with my in-laws, and they appreciate that, even if it takes a little more time for them to write me texts and read my kinda-childish texts.  The effort counts. \n \nNTA OP, but your kid has to keep coming first. Do not let Amanda move in until some sign-learning conditions have been met.

Luckily, ASL DOES have a linguistic base in common with English. I think looking at learning the ASL alphabet for signing purposes, and spelling words that way, could be a lot less intimidating (if more time-consuming) for Amanda. No phones or writing props required. Maybe a couple helpful posters tacked up in different parts of the house. Any words learned on top of those letters could be a bonus.

Some people have a really easy time learning it other people struggle and can't make it passed the alphabet. The trickiest part is trying to practice it with those fluent in ASL outside of the classroom. It's at a totally different speed and there's a lot of \"slurred\" signing.

Its much harder for an adult to learn a new language than a young person.  I tried to learn Spanish in school and was a dismal failure.  I feel like some compromise could be in order here.  Girlfriend tries and daughter copes with her non-preferred form of communication atleast 50 percent of the time.  As time moves forward girlfriend will learn more and maybe it will be 40 percent, then 30 percent.\n\nI just feel like an awful amount of pressure is being put onto the girlfriend - when as an adult she may really be struggling.  She may just be bad at languages, may NEVER be good at sign language (like I battled with Spanish) but should she be penalized for that?  Possibly the pressure is making her just want to throw in the towel and give up.  Its not really fair to her.", "Amanda: **\"It's not that she refuses, they do have a way to talk.

I have a hard time with languages and even ASL. I have studied for over a year on ASL and still can't hold a conversation. My ASL is so broken that I even went to the doctor because I was having such a hard time with it. **(Doctor said the rules and grammar are different from what we're used to in English and our brains are trying to map out a basis for communication. He said what can take one person months can take others years and that it is even more difficult for people with ADD/ADHD type disorders.)**\n\nPerhaps persuade her to start small and work with her more one on one than just giving up on her. Perhaps even have Ruby help teach her. It could be a bonding experience for them. Have Ruby write out the word them te4ach her the sign. \n\nYou both haven't known each other that long.

At work, shopping, casual social encounters, getting to know people who dont know signlanguage.

And its probably not good if she is learning from home, that people will accomodate her preference for signing. They wont!\n\nSo either way your child will have to be able to accept communicating with people who cant or wont learn sign language. It wont always be possible for her to stay in her comfortable zone.\n\nAnd for your partner to not want to take on sign language, when your daughter IS able to understand her, and make herself understod regardless doesnt make your partner cruella.

If you don't want to have to learn ASL, that's fine, but she had an out before she met the daughter and chose not to take it, which makes her an ass for giving OP and his daughter false hope while knowing she didn't want to make accommodations for a disabled child.  \n\nOP is NTA regardless. It's fine if this is a deal breaker (for either of them). It just sucks that he took his time to get to know this woman, to the point he felt like he could introduce their kids, and now she's trying to force a child to accommodate to her needs instead of... being the adult/parent.", "I agree! It would be one thing if Ruby was an adult who didn't live at home and OP & GF only visited with Ruby every few months.

It\u2019s totally your and Amanda\u2019s choice to decide it is not worth your time and effort. But it\u2019s also OP and your fictional partners choice not to date someone who doesn\u2019t care to do the minimum to communicate with their child. Both those things are allowed and fair. \n\nIt not just the sign language though. It\u2019s also how she talks about the kid and her statement that she would basically never bother because she thinks it\u2019s coddling.", "It's his damn child. If she expects the relationship to move forward then yes she 100% needs and should learn an entire language to better communicate with a CHILD.

It's pretty straight forward for most letters, I just confused over h, f, g, q, k and p, I think.

I have! An hour a day is a semi-slow  learning pace for me and I am a highly educated person who is good with languages. 15 minutes a day is not a way to actually learn a language, just a few phrases.", "Then why didn't he tell her that he expected her to learn ASL when they started dating? He probably didn't want to scare her off and then thought he could spring it on her when she was too invested to just walk away.\n\nESH.", "We're hearing his side. By calling her selfish, etc it didn't sound like he's a very understanding teacher. His GF just recently met the daughter, give her a break. Or, break up. Too much pressure too soon causes some people to shut down. If she's struggling and he's pushing, she'll shut down. That's not unexpected", "It's not for \"no reason\". Can you imagine having every conversation with your phone or written down? ASL is her main language.", "I disagree.

And the original comment they responded to is saying that Amanda, the GF, isn't in the wrong for making a kid accommodate to her needs instead of learning a language literally based on the one she speaks which is relatively easy to learn the basics of (was going to be my major before COVID, and I'm an autistic person with mute spells, so I know quite a bit about ASL).\n\nIn no situation, no matter the language, OP is NTA and the GF is an ass because she had the chance to back out before the kids met and chose to give everyone false hope instead of saying she didn't want to accommodate the kid.", "Okay but the onus of communicating shouldn\u2019t be solely on the twelve year old.", "But that's not what's happening here. It's the kids potential home situation.  These people need to break up.", "I guess that's the real question here. Is OP being extremely pushy about something to someone they refer to as generally compassionate? If he is putting a lot of pressure on her to learn, it could be making the experience stressful on a rather new relationship ship.\nAlso, how often is she spending time with Ruby? Has she really had enough time to immerse herself in the language. For a 9 month relationship, and only knowing Ruby for 3, there is a good chance they have only spent a handful of times together for extended periods of time. That's not enough time to learn a language.", "Yes, they definitely might not be compatible at this point and honestly I don\u2019t think they will last as a couple. But I have had periods in my life where I was so stressed by stuff due to work, family, etc that even something small might have resulted in me feeling too overwhelmed and saying \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d I don\u2019t know gf\u2019s side. OP doesn\u2019t provide much clarifying info. So I am giving her grace. I don\u2019t think she is a jerk. For whatever reason, learning sign language is just not something she can accommodate right now.", "I agree, and those questions are what drove a lot of my responses to this thread. \n\nWe don't have enough information, frankly. And even if she was around the kid weekly (I can't imagine it's daily, this is way too soon) that's still not a ton of time. 10-13ish interactions.", "That\u2019s fair. I certainly have had the same periods in my life, although you would think OP would mention if Amanda was depressed or going through PTSD or something. Maybe he just doesn\u2019t know.

Who knows? I agree he was definitely out of line to berate her.", "Ya my mom cheated on my dad with a married man and then a few years after their divorce, she introduced me to another married man. They dated for a bit, he molested me, and awhile after that she broke up with him then it wasn't long until she was with someone else and continued to be with guys for no longer than a couple years before she was with another guy. Her current bf is the longest relationship she has ever had. Married 3 times, the last left her a widow and he had 2 daughters of his own.

You called her \"selfish and lazy,\" but she might just be frustrated and insecure.  It sounds like you are the one who escalated it into an argument.\n\nRuby is your daughter, and you get to make decisions about how to communicate with her, and what communication skills you want to focus on developing.  And I have no experience with nonverbal people.  So I'm not going to make any judgments about how you've asked others to communicate with Ruby; anyone who wants to be in a relationship with you has an absolute obligation to abide by your decisions in this area.  That said, if Amanda is struggling with sign language--just as Ruby struggles with written communication--it might behoove all of you to work together to find additional options for how Amanda and Ruby can communicate effectively.", "NTA, it\u2019s reasonable to expect your girlfriend to treat your daughter with respect.  I hope you make the right decision and choose someone who will make your daughters life better, not more difficult.", "NTA- It's one thing to be incapable, it's another thing to not try. Can't vs won't. I've ended relationships over women saying can't when they mean won't. Own your decisions.\n\nIf I was in your situation, being unwilling to learn would be a deal breaker for me. My kids come first- including their ability to communicate with my SO.\n\nBeing unwilling to learn shows she doesn't care about the kid, who should be the most important person in your life.", "NTA. Your first job is to be a father to your child and advocate for her, which is exactly what you're doing.

My take is that she\u2019s on the fence about her long term commitment and so she\u2019s not sure she wants to put in the effort it takes to learn sign.", "Additionally how high are OP\u2019s expectations. Because it sounds Amanda is struggling and instead of being compassionate towards her, OP keeps pushing for her to learn. No surprise instead of wanting to learn she started to hate it. It\u2019s obvious OP wants her to communicate with his daughter NOW in a way daughter wants. But it\u2019s not the way. Daughter is also entitled. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s not comfortable with writing, but neither are gf and her kids with signing. Being impatient doesn\u2019t help anyone. \nAnd everyone keeps telling Op to break up. But if he does unless he find someone who already knows the sign language, the story will repeat itself. \nPeople here also cannot divide gf words from OP brothers. Brother is TA here. \nGF is frustrated. OP should first think about how he treated gf, was he demanding, forceful? And then he should meet with gf and talk. Not fight, yell or blame. Talk. And he should accept that he might be slightly at fault here. 3 or 9 months is not long enough. And honestly if she started learning the language the minute they started to be together I would call her (or him) crazy. \nSo it\u2019s not 9 months. More like 3-6. It\u2019s still not enough to know the basics of you add it to your job/sleep/ other responsibilities", "I do agree in a sense with this, but I think the fact that she flat out refuses is what bothers me.

A 9 month relationship does not give him the right to be asking *this* much of her. It\u2019s one thing to expect it eventually, that\u2019s fair and is just something he\u2019s just going to have to accept might be more than some can/will do for him, but it\u2019s a whole other thing to do it like this and berate her for it.", "Eventually Ruby will have to get used to communicating with people who don't sign.

She tried to learn but was being pushed a lot to do it better and faster, sign language is not easy, even harder for an adult with a job and kids.\n\nI read it twice and it seems that he pushed her over the edge because she couldn't take it anymore, trying to learn something hard when you have somebody constantly reminding you that you are slow and not the best is frustrating and annoying.\n\nI go with YTA because she was really trying buy Op blew it by pushing her too much, 3 months is not enough to learn a whole new difficult language when you have kids and a job to take care off and you are an adult.

The fact that she's decided it's 'unnecessary' suggests she just can't be bothered, and that's deeply concerning if she has any intention of remaining in the relationship long term.

She IS trying, she IS communicating with the child, it\u2019s ridiculous to claim she isn\u2019t and if my partner were being as rude about my efforts as OP I would want to give up too. \n\nThe relationship isn\u2019t feasible long term if this is how things are going to stay, the kid deserves to be spoken to on her own terms in her home, but the gf is not doing anything wrong and she\u2019s certainly not being lazy or selfish, their lives just aren\u2019t compatible and it\u2019s unfair to judge and berate her for that like OP is going.", "She\u2019s clearly not using them anyway since she\u2019s choosing not to sign", "Take my upvote; agreed this is the only answer.", "Nope, any decent witch would have jumped at the chance to learn another language and use it to have in-jokes. This is pure wicked stepmother vibes.", "Yta, now this is why you don't date single parent, some are very demanding", "YTA. You are only some boyfriend of 9 months. It\u2019s a time commitment to learn a second language. You are not married and Amanda is not Rudy\u2019s stepmother. You are level jumping to expect your girlfriend of only 9 months to learn a new language to talk to your daughter. She is not family at this point.  You could disappear from her life next week.  It takes 2 years of study to become proficient at sign language.  This is a working mother and a single mother. How much free time do you think she has when she is not taking care of her own daughter.  If you were engaged or dating for more than months then sh should learn sign language. But at this point you are still counting in months.", "\"...my girlfriend, Amanda. We've been dating for around 9 months...\"\n\nThis is why YTA: you're expecting her to behave like someone you're married to, or at least engaged to.\n\nBTW, calling her \"lazy\" here is not helping her see your side of things.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter needs to understand that not everyone is going to make acceptions just because she is mute. Can she really not talk or just chooses not to and won't because you support her being mute? It's not like she's deaf, that would be a different story. You are coddling your daughter. Not everyone is capable of learning sign language.", "I\u2019m going against the grain here. Your kid CAN communicate. You\u2019ve been with this woman leas than a year. You\u2019re asking for a lot of effort simply to make your kid comfortable when there\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll be in each others lives a year from now. \n\nIf I\u2019m an asshole for my opinion then I\u2019ll take the title happily. But fuck that shit. YTA", "NTA.\nI learned sign language just for my grandchildren before they learn to speak. They are not deaf or mute. It's just easier to sign than talk for the littles. I'm 58. If I can do it, anyone can.\n\nThe girlfriend needs to go. It's not important, my ass. Communication with children is the most important thing.", "Remember that runy also has other ways to communicate and it takes years to learn a new language. Also it seems op pushed her too hard as theyve only known eachother 3 months", "It\u2019s odd to me that more people aren\u2019t seeing it this way. She\u2019s known his daughter for 3 months. Maybe she\u2019s a slow learner, maybe she feels overly pressured by him, maybe she just has a hard time learning sign language and wants him to back off a little.\n\nBut the most important thing to take away from this OP, is that you don\u2019t really know the issue your girlfriend is having because instead of communicating, you went directly to accusations and name calling. You didn\u2019t ask how she\u2019s feeling about learning sign language or anything about her struggles with it. You made a demand and when she got defensive you went on the attack. No good comes from that kind of communication. I understand that this is your daughter and it\u2019s easy to get emotionally reactive, but you have to listen to her as a way of understanding her position rather than trying to defend your kid. Try to understand her rather than fight to be right.\n\nAs of now, YTA.", "I wholly agree. This is not about being selfish. Amanda has known this kid for 3 fucking months and she obviously feels that their relationship is moving along fine so far. Signing can come with time. It's not \"selfish\" to be exhausted by the idea of learning a new fucking language in addition to the rest of life's responsibilities. \n\nOP, if you want her to learn, that's fine. If you are sad that she doesn't want to at this time, that's fine. For you to call her \"selfish\" and claim that it's \"the least she can do\" you are way out of line, imo. I think Amanda is right to be angry at you for your words. I would understand if you said you feel sad about the situation but, angry? I think that's unwarranted.", "She did try though, she struggled and op sounded pushy like you have to learn asl now", "She did though but 3 months isnt enough and op sounded pushy", "Except the daughter has other ways of communicating as technology as gone so far. Also theyve known eachother 9 months and he expects her to know sign language", "Op sounded like he was pushy and expecting her to learn asl quickly as possible so of course she would snap", "But if she wants a long term relationship with the op, this means learning sing language  to communicate with the daughter.", "Except shes a single mother juggling a job and a child. Op expects her to learn asl basically right this second and the pressure got to her. Also learning a new language is extremely hard", "You\u2019re not crazy. I\u2019m sorry they made you feel that way. I know ASL, it\u2019s a beautiful language. One of my best friend\u2019s is hard of hearing. We met in hs and I almost immediately started learning ASL to better communicate with him. He said I was the first person he met that tried learning ASL before he had to bring it up in some way. It broke my heart. People should learn to accommodate people they love if ASL is their language. If she loved you, I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s too much to ask for her to communicate with your daughter. You and your daughter both deserve better", "Sign language is your daughter's voice. While she has alternatives, nothing is as quick, thorough and emotive as signing. You cannot truly have a conversation through text without sacrificing timing and emotion and it's not like she chooses to converse exclusively in ancient Latin ffs. \n\nLearning sign language with basic skill is not too much to ask and anyone in your life who thinks that encouraging sign language is coddling should be the first person kicked to the curb. WTAF are these adults thinking? (And I use the term adults loosely).", "As someone who\u2019s partially deaf I\u2019d take her refusal to learn sign language as a pretty big way of refusing to talk to your kid.", "No I got it, I mean refusing to speak ASL. I guess I could put sign.", "Yeah I'm surprised with all the NTA. I seriously doubt I could learn a whole new language as an adult.", "Reminds me of when my (now ex) friend called my mum a helicopter parent because she wouldn't let me walk in the street by myself at night. \n\nI live in one of the worst crime suburbs in my city AND I'm an autistic lady. \nThere's also not very many street lights near my house...", "but she could try! there\u2019s nothing wrong with not being able to get further with learning or it\u2019s just taking time. but she refuses to continue learning because it\u2019s too hard.\n\nit\u2019s unfair to Ruby that she can\u2019t communicate in her language and having to write what she wants to say instead of being able to say it herself with sign language. \n\nin my opinion the effort counts. she is not trying so yes she\u2018s TA", "Amanda and the brother will make a really cute, entitled, ableist couple once OP dumps her wretched-ness", "I\u2019m team girlfriend. I dislike meaningful relationships where both of the people put in effort and grow together too.", "OP didn't even asked Amanda to take extra lessons just that she picks up some basics he and Ruby can teach her. OP you are NTA your daughter is lucky to have you. And I hope you find a kind partner for you AND Ruby but Amanda seems not the one.", "Could be she has trouble learning it and is embarrassed. I learned ASL as a kid and although my mother took many of the classes with me couldn't retain more than just the alphabet. She was embarrassed because other people in the classes picked it up quickly and she got confused.

Your voice is never heard? You have to try that much harder to get any point across and it all relies on the other person actually reading what you wrote?", "To be fair\u2026 English and Spanish aren\u2019t fair comparisons though. She cannot speak. Ruby cannot communicate in Amanda\u2019s language. She is physically unable to. She can\u2019t just learn to not be mute.", "Hmmm... I agree with this halfway, because I thought of exactly this initially. I would only agree OP is the AH in that flipped situation if the other party was an adult (like a parent) or even a more distant relative (like a niece or a cousin). This is the nuance that changes it for me. \n\nI do think if you wish to be in a serious relationship or possibly marriage to someone with a child, you go with the openness that you may play the role of a parental figure and it would be really odd for a parental figure to be so resistant to learning how to communicate to their (step)child directly. He's right to be wary of someone who is so unaccommodating, even going as far as to say he's coddling his daughter.", "Make that 1st date", "I think it's easier to overlook OP's assholery, because he is erring on the side of his kid (and he should do that). \n\nReddit is pretty young, and pretty black-and-white. In Reddit's eyes, you usually either suck or you rock. The problem is, out in the grownup real world, most of us are a mix.\n\nThe ableism sucks. As a mom in her 50s, I have a natural sympathy for other moms who don't yet get it. I've spent the last 25 years learning how I don't yet get it. Regardless of whether OP's GF has a processing disorder, she is experiencing difficulty learning to sign from the instruction he has given her, so if he really cares for her, and she is an otherwise decent woman, he should probably try to lead her by the hand to a place where she can more easily learn and doesn't feel like it's all for naught.", "This isn't coddling, it's accommodating a disability.", "Actually, it isn't even learning a different language. Just a different way of \"speaking\" the language. And while a lot of people never realize they're doing it, we that hear still use very rudimentary sign language when in situations we can't actually hear each other due to noise and/or distance. Signing that you're headed to go eat, get a drink, driving somewhere, asking time, etc. And from some of what I've seen, while I can't remember the exact signs, when you see the sign, and are told the meaning, it actually makes sense", ">Parents- all parents- should be willing to do anything for their children\n\nHard disagree. I think this gets into psychotic, self-sacrificing territory that ends up being bad for everyone, parent and child.\n\nParents are people. They need to take care of their child, but they also need to take care of themselves.\n\nFurthermore parental obligation does not override other moral obligations. Parents should not be willing to commit horrible crimes just for their child's benefit.\n\nI agree with your general point that, in this specific case, Amanda should have been willing to do more if she expected to become Ruby's step-mother.\n\nI just disagree with the absolute statement that there shouldn't be *any* boundaries or limitations.", "Personally I would try to learn it because I'm very sensitive to kids needs and would be upset seeing her struggling to communicate. But if I was having a hard time after making a solid attempt and then my boyfriend made me feel bad about it, I would question whether or not staying with him was good for my mental health", "Man, I'm trying to propose soon, but I'm worried she'll beat me to it.\n\nOtherwise, that first sentence would come in handy for future breakups.", "Also important - Ruby already has to accommodate others in order to exist when she is outside of the home because sign language is not standard. That is already a burden she is navigating the world with. Home is probably the only place she has where she can exist with the accommodations she needs guaranteed. Even if she goes to a school where sign language is standard, that only makes two safe spaces for Ruby to communicate in the way that is most comfortable for her.  Amanda refusing to learn takes that safe space away. If Amanda wants to stay and become a guardian/stepparent one day to Ruby, this is the bare minimum. And frankly, her refusal comes from a very privileged place and is quite ableist. Not to mention the danger in case of emergencies someone else mentioned. \n\nYou're not coddling.

Because maybe she's waiting until 15 minutes in before she wants to devote a large enough chunk of an already crazy life to learn another language.", "Same.", "Really interetsing, right? to my knowledge, there even are \"dialects\", where a word is signed differently in one part of a country than in another.", "Of course, but my failing to learn something wasn't directly affecting a member of my household. \n\nThere are times when you need to just step up, and including a child is usually one of those times", "That's brutal.
