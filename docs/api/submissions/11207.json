She can understand words, but we use sign language to communicate. While she can use her phone or write, obviously she prefers to sign.\n\nThe issue is my girlfriend, Amanda. We've been dating for around 9 months, and introduced our children around 3 months ago. They don't know sign language so communication with Ruby was awkward at first, she hates having to write or use her phone at home. So I taught Amanda some basic signs beforehand, and I've continued teaching her and Mia more in this time. Mia is getting a lot better actually.\n\nBut Amanda has apparently decided it's too hard and refuses to learn any more. She says that it's 'unnecessary' since Ruby can understand her and communicate other ways. While Ruby is usually willing to do that for them, she doesn't enjoy it and finds it frustrating. I told Amanda she's being selfish and lazy. That it's not fair to put all the effort on Ruby. It's one thing if she doesn't get it after years, but it's only been a few months. It's just ridiculous. We got into a fight over it and she basically called me an asshole and said it's not her fault she struggles with it. But that doesn't mean just give up. If she wants to be in our life it's the bare minimum effort to put in. \n\nI clearly think she's just being selfish, while she thinks I'm an asshole and unfair. I vented to my brother and he agreed with Amanda. That I can't force her to learn and not everyone is good with language. And that Ruby doesn't 'need' it and I'm 'coddling her'. I'm honestly still pissed off but I do love Amanda. She's normally thoughtful and kind, and I guess it's possible it's just me being overprotective of Ruby. I think it's a reasonable expectation, but I'm starting to doubt myself", "created_utc": 1677681356, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11f5c7d/aita_calling_my_girlfriend_selfish_for_refusing/", "score": 1030, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she's not willing to learn sign for your daughter it means she has no plans of being a big part of her life. Let's say y'all get married one day... she's going to just not communicate with your daughter directly? She's okay with that? You're okay with that? What happens if someone isn't there to translate? What happens if there's an emergency and it's just her and your daughter there and your daughter is trying to explain what she's feeling through sign before passing out?\n\nHow is your daughter going to feel that someone is choosing not to communicate with her? How is she going to feel being excluded from communication at home? How is she going to feel knowing someone thinks she's too difficult to have a simple conversation? That they won't put in the effort to love and care for her enough to sign? How is she feeling right now knowing that you're choosing to be with someone that will never prioritize her? That won't put in the work to learn sign? That doesn't think she's worth the difficulty of learning sign? That you put that relationship over the comfort and family she deserves?\n\nYour daughter deserves better and you really need to consider how this impacts her. Yes, your girlfriend is lazy and selfish, but more importantly, your daughter deserves more than her. She deserves someone that is going to put in the effort to love her enough to learn sign. She deserves someone that will do the hard work and learn sign for her. I'm serious when I say this, break up with your girlfriend. I don't care how much love you think is there, there's a lack of love and care for your daughter and that should never be okay. My sister is deaf and it was hell growing up with one parent who refused to learn sign for her. Don't let your daughter go through that. Don't let her sit with those feelings all by herself. She's going to resent you one day for staying in a relationship with someone that doesn't truly care about her.\n\nEdit: Your brother is an asshole too.", "NTA. This should be a dealbreaker for you.", "NTA. Lots to unpack here. \n\nFirst of all, your daughter uses sign language to communicate and if that is her preferred method of communicating then aligning yourself to that is not coddling at all. I actually wish I could learn how to sign! \n\nIf Amanda really and truly wants a future with you then she needs to understand that you and your kiddo(s) are a packaged deal. She can\u2019t pick and choose which parts of you she wants to embrace and let in. The fact that it\u2019s too hard for her and she hasn\u2019t really tried that hard tells you all you need to know about how she\u2019s going to put effort into your relationship.", "NTA. If it were me and she refused to learn, it would be the end of the relationship. Also any future relationships would start with me explaining my situation and explaining if it gets serious down the road, this is something that will need to be done to stay in my life. My daughter is my priority. If you want to be in my life long term eventually you will need to learn sign language.", "NTA. Anecdotal but my besties husband learned Spanish so he could communicate easily with her non English speaking relatives. IME, you do things that are important to you. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to continue a relationship with someone who put the onus on a child to communicate in a way they aren\u2019t comfortable just so they didn\u2019t have to put forth the effort", "NTA for wanting Amanda to learn. If she doesn\u2019t want to, maybe you need to re evaluate your relationship?", "NTA, do you see a future with a woman who point blank refuses to speak to your daughter?", "NTA, you are standing up for your daughter. It\u2019s one thing if she was working on learning ASL but wasn\u2019t making progress, it\u2019s another to act like it isn\u2019t important. It is like if someone was in a wheelchair but could walk a little with assistance and your girlfriend insisted on a house without a ramp because they aren\u2019t pretty it it\u2019s a pain for her. \n\nWhen you enter a relationship with kids you have to commit to them too. You don\u2019t get to ignore them or don\u2019t care about their needs. Everyone deserves to have their voice be heard. Your daughter\u2019s voice is an expressive language. Body language and signing allows her to be heard. It gives her equal ground. Playing a computer generated voice allows your girlfriend to ignore the emotion behind your daughter\u2019s words. It allows her to interpret your daughter\u2019s word to what ever is convenient for her. \n\nDump her! She isn\u2019t an equal participant to this relationship.", "NTA Whom will you choose? Ruby or Amanda? This is what it comes down to. Amanda does not bother to try to communicate in Ruby\u2019s language. Not one bit. The onus is on Ruby to adapt to Amanda. Is this fair to your daughter? Your girlfriend of only 9 months has shown you that she is not willing to do what it takes to be with you and Ruby, your DAUGHTER! Amanda is selfish! We are not talking about something trivial. We are talking about communication, the primary way we connect with others. By refusing to learn sign language beyond a few basics, Amanda is refusing to communicate and connect with Ruby. Is this the kind of person you want to be with? She\u2019s an AH. Your brother is an AH. If you sell out your daughter to keep Amanda in your life, then you would become the AH too.", "Amanda has the right to say that she does not want to learn ASL, but what kind of a message does it send to Ruby? This is not good for your daughter. Think very hard about which relationship takes prime position in your life.", "NTA. She won\u2019t learn to communicate. What if the two of you have another child who is HOH or mute? What if one of her kids is injured and needs to communicate via ASL? Is she still going to put all of the effort on them? \n\nHard line for me, she\u2019d be gone. Babies can learn to sign, so can a grown person.", "Give Amanda her walking papers. She isn\u2019t the partner for you", "NTA, but you'd be one if you keep dating Amanda.", "NTA. Amanda has a right to not want to learn sign language, but if she's unwilling to put in the effort to communicate with your daughter do you really see a future with her?", "Like you said \" if she wants to be in our lives\": this is your hill to die on ( and i personally agree).\nSo if she refuses i'm not sure there's a futuz for you. This is where you should start jour conversation if you borh want to spend your life together.\nAnd she has a right to refuse\nNah", "NTA. Get rid of the GF. \n\nAnd if it were me with a child who used sign language, any family around the child regularly would also have to learn. It should be a bare minimum for anyone who wants to be in the life of a person who uses it.", "Nta. And this woman has shown you who she is. She won\u2019t put more than a little effort into meeting your child\u2019s needs. Pay attention.", "NTA.\n\nYou are a good parent for calling out your gf\u2019s behavior. Amanda\u2019s already showing you how little she values your daughter. You don\u2019t have to be married to treat someone\u2019s child with respect. Since this is a situation where she\u2019s dating someone with a special needs child, the bare minimum she can do is attempt to establish some sort of bond and try to communicate.\n\nIt seems like she doesn\u2019t take your daughter\u2019s diagnosis seriously since it\u2019s mutism and not deafness. It is wrong of Amanda, as an adult, to try and shift responsibility onto Ruby.\n\nAre you considering a future with this woman? How can she watch over your kid (in the future) if she\u2019s already showing resentment at having to learn sign language?", "NTA you guys are not compatible if she doesn\u2019t think communicating with your daughter is important.", "Amanda doesn\u2019t want to learn to sign because she doesn\u2019t care what your daughter has to say. \u201cRuby doesn\u2019t need it\u201d maybe not, but she DESERVES it. And if you stick with Amanda you\u2019re telling Ruby you agree that Ruby doesn\u2019t deserve to be heard.", "NTA. \n\nIf your girlfriend plans on being your long term partner, she's going to have to step up and learn sign language. If she doesn't, that should be a huge deal breaker for you.", "NTA, but I think your relationship is no longer compatible. Every single day of her life Ruby will be required to use communication skills other than her preferred method of signing simply because there's not going to be enough people she encounters in public able to sign back to her. \n\nDo you think it's fair to have your own life partner refuse to use Ruby's preferred communication? How othering that must feel to Ruby to have someone capable of learning refuse to put in any effort to be able to communicate with her easily.", "\\> If she wants to be in our life, it's the bare minimum effort to put in.\n\nYou've summarized it perfectly.  NTA.", "If you introduce every girl you date for 6 months to your kids, they're likely to see a revolving door of women by the time they're 18. The situation you're currently in is a direct example of it. You didn't know that this woman wasn't compassionate enough to be a safe adult figure for your kid", "NTA you SHOULD be overprotective of your daughter! SHE comes first above everyone else. Your daughter's disabilty deserves accommodations from, at the very least, those who are supposed to love her. This chick is just not right for your family. If you force her to learn, she'll resent you. If you don't, your daughter will resent you. Time to move on.", "NTA. If she even has interest in furthering her relationship with you and actually likes your daughter as well then it's not that hard for her to put in the effort to learn.", "NTA, it's not just her not wanting to learn because it's difficult, but it's how dismissive she was about it. \nI think in this case, it's good you introduced them so early. Otherwise, how deep would you have been before you learned she dissent care enough to try to communicate with your daughter.", "if Amanda is not a child, why is she acting like one?", "NTA if Amanda wants a meaningful relationship with you and your daughter she would put the effort in. She isn\u2019t which speaks volumes about her.", "When you choose to date someone with children, you are also effectively \"dating\" their kids. And she doesn't think that your daughter's communication really matters. Of course you're NTA.", "NTA. This would be a deal breaker for me. I would not want to date someone who is this selfish and inconsiderate of my child\u2019s needs. Ruby deserves better.", "NTA Does Amanda see your relationship as long term? If so, how is this different from her learning any other language to make a child feel more comfortable? While ASL isn\u2019t easy, ( I learned a small amount as a firefighter), to make a kid feel included? Worth it.", "NTA. You're being a good father.\n\n>And that Ruby doesn't 'need' it and I'm 'coddling her'.\n\nIt's her language! If she spoke Polish, you'd want Amanda to learn Polish. Especially since Ruby CANNOT speak English. Amanda and your brother are the AHs here.", "NAH\n\nShe met your children three months ago and struggles to pick up sign language. While you have a right to choose a partner who will meet your daughter on her level, three months is hardly a lot of time. \n\nI think you could have an honest discussion and say \u201cI really love you but I will never propose to and marry someone who won\u2019t learn sign language given my daughter. I understand that our relationship is still fairly new and it\u2019s a lot to ask but I won\u2019t move forward unless that is something you are willing to do.\u201d\n\nThis will set clear expectations and open an honest dialogue. Amanda will have to make her own decision and you can proceed accordingly. I suspect you\u2019ll have your answer within a few months. If I were to guess you will break up but if not that means she stepped up. Good luck!", "NTA the point of dating is usually to eventually get married or long term commitment and if she\u2019s not willing to at least continue to try to learn sign language then how do you think she will act as a step mother/important person in her life. I\u2019d just end it now before the breakup gets harder.", "NTA. I would say this is a good glimpse into your future life if you stay with this woman. Who tells a parent they are coddling their kid because they use sign language? Seriously wtf. That just floored me.\n\nEdit: I hope you and your daughter talk about her being the AH in sign language right in front of her. Better yet, if you break up with her, do it in sign language. \ud83d\ude02", "NTA.  And Amanda has shown you who she is \u2026 she wants the child with a disability to accommodate to her needs.

I'd tell her to start packing if I were you.", "I think if Amanda, or at least anyone reasonable, believed that if your relationship was serious and capable of going somewhere, she would understand that your children are your first priority (should be) and that she would need to learn to communicate effectively with Ruby both as a sign of respect and simple practicality.  On the other hand, if she doesn't feel like this is a serious relationship or has a real future to it, why bother?\n\nI think you should have a serious conversation with Amanda about your relationships future.  Her excuses of \"Ruby doesn't need it\" and \"you're coddling her\" sounds like BS for laziness and/or not respecting any of your kids.  If she really isn't interested in going there, its time to cut your losses and move on.\n\nAn employer would be legally required to be more accommodating of Ruby's disability than Amanda has been and while Ruby should be capable of communicating with random strangers who don't know sign, Amanda isn't a random stranger.", "Nta, and this is a hill I would die on.

No, you\u2019re not being unreasonable at all.  You aren\u2019t coddling Ruby, either.  You were right before - learning to communicate with Ruby is the bare minimum for this relationship to move forward.

It\u2019s only been 9 months. Learning a new language - including sign language - is hard and time consuming.

The fact she refuses to learn shows she's not a long-time good choice.\n\nBreak up gently, and put that up front in your dating profile that you know ASL, it may get a better quality person for you who can communicate with your daughter.", "Definitely NOT the asshole! Not at all. She is! Break up with her. \ud83d\ude44", "NTA I would never date or marry someone who wasn't willing to put in the time to learn to communicate with my child.", "NTA. You know the kind of home you want your daughter raised in. Does your gf fit into that image?", "I haven't been around mute people much to know really, but it does sound like a reasonable expectation. At least to try to learn, nobody expects her to understand it overnight. If she's serious about being with you, she'll be a big part of your daughter's life and it'll mean a lot to her; it does sound like the greatest gift she could give her.  \nHowever, it's true that not all people are good with languages, or even learning new things in general. So maybe you shouldn't put it as \"you NEED to learn this\".

I started learning ASL at the beginning of February for my job and I\u2019m literally already communicating effectively. It\u2019s a basic sign (heh) of respect to make the attempts to learn.

It\u2019s also frustrating for your daughter to not be able to communicate in the way she prefers. \nGirlfriend should just try a little harder, and watch a couple YouTube videos.", "NTA\n\nLet's put it this way.  What if you and your daughter spoke a foreign language?  And, in this analogy, your daughter literally could not speak English (as she's mute).  Would you be an AH for asking your girlfriend to learn at least some familiarity with your language?\n\nWhile your brother is right that you can't force Amanda to learn, it will make things very difficult for Ruby when she can't communicate her needs back to her.   Even though I'm sure Ruby perfectly understands what you say (as you said she's not deaf but mute) a conversation needs to be **two way**.  Ruby can't communicate back in any other way.\n\nSo I'd say Amanda is absolutely the AH here as is your brother.  And you need to break up with Amanda, since your daughter's needs come first.  And one is **parents who can understand her communication back to them.**", "NTA it seems crazy to tell people in the internet to break up, but how is there any future in this relationship? How will you bond the three of you together if your partner never understands?

Maybe you can convince her that knowing sign language is good for her career and turn it into a win/win.

You've only been together 9 months, many couples wait until a year to meet the kids.\n\nRuby is right to not want to have to talk via phone at home, but learning a whole new language less than a year into a relationship is a massive time commitment.

She can understand words, but we use sign language to communicate. While she can use her phone or write, obviously she prefers to sign.\n\nThe issue is my girlfriend, Amanda. We've been dating for around 9 months, and introduced our children around 3 months ago.

So I taught Amanda some basic signs beforehand, and I've continued teaching her and Mia more in this time. Mia is getting a lot better actually.\n\nBut Amanda has apparently decided it's too hard and refuses to learn any more. She says that it's 'unnecessary' since Ruby can understand her and communicate other ways. While Ruby is usually willing to do that for them, she doesn't enjoy it and finds it frustrating. I told Amanda she's being selfish and lazy. That it's not fair to put all the effort on Ruby. It's one thing if she doesn't get it after years, but it's only been a few months. It's just ridiculous.

If she wants to be in our life it's the bare minimum effort to put in. \n\nI clearly think she's just being selfish, while she thinks I'm an asshole and unfair. I vented to my brother and he agreed with Amanda. That I can't force her to learn and that Ruby doesn't 'need' it and I'm 'coddling her'. I'm honestly still pissed off but I do love Amanda. She's normally thoughtful and kind, and I guess it's possible it's just me being overprotective of Ruby.

Ruby already does it everyday all day with people who don't know how to do SL. \n\nYour brother isn't wrong either with not everyone is good with a language. It takes adults longer to learn a language than a child hence why her 7 year old daughter is picking it up easily. \n\nShe has only been learning for 3 months how to sign. You aren't going to perfect it quickly as an adult in 3 months. I do have a feeling Amanda is feeling a lot of pressure and feeling stressed to try to learn it and perfect it.

So, she had some under her belt already and first meeting wasn't awkward. She might have been feeling she has to play catch up and then just got overwhelmed. On top of that if she not using it everyday, all day, it takes longer to learn the language and feel much harder to learn it.

I told Amanda she's being selfish and lazy. That it's not fair to put all the effort on Ruby. It's one thing if she doesn't get it after years, but it's only been a few months. It's just ridiculous. We got into a fight over it and she basically called me an asshole and said it's not her fault she struggles with it. But that doesn't mean just give up.

I can turn that around and say the same about you and Ruby. Both of you are selfish to expect someone to learn a language for you guys. Ruby can be classified as lazy also for not wanting to communicate in another way when she is able to.  On top of that she has said it is hard and she struggles learning it that doesn't make her selfish and lazy to stop it. \n\nYou say it isn't fair to put all the effort on Ruby but it isn't fair either to put all the effort on Amanda to learn a whole new language.

But thinking that means that she can continue the relationship and not expect any pushback on that is ludicrous", "thats so dumb. Thats like saying speaking might be hard for Ruby and its ok for her to speak being hard but her giving up and using ASL isnt ok. \n\nWe dont actually know WHY or what could be coming from Amandas side here.", "Yeah because if she becomes stepmom this is is a sign of things to come. Parents- all parents- should be willing to do anything for their children- she\u2019s already putting down a boundary- doesn\u2019t bode well for the future. NTA.", "Your daughter should be able to communicate with her family at home. If your friend isn't interested in conversing with your child in a way your child is comfortable with, I think there's only one solution. If I were you, tell her to start packing her.", "This is so important! It's even beyond basic respect, this is both an awful message and a safety issue: the message she's sending to Ruby is that it doesn't matter what **she** needs to say, the only important thing is that Amanda is able to express herself and not viceversa Do you think Ruby would ever open to her with a premise like that? And onto the safety: what if Ruby needs to communicate there's an emergency and she has nothing to write on on hand? If Amanda's the only adult around it can even become dangerous. She can't be trusted to be alone with the daughter until she learns at least the basics", "Yeah, the adult is putting the burden of communication on a child. That's deeply unfair and unkind.\n\nYou're NTA, but you would be if you continue this relationship.", "In addition, she only met the daughter 3 months ago. So after 3 months, she is willing to give up completely on being able to communicate with OPs daughter. This would be a complete deal breaker for me.", "Or maybe he doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat.", "She sounds like a genuinely good person who truly cared about you.", "Thank you for sharing.  Beautiful story.  Hope your life is rich with people like your Dad\u2019s ex-girlfriend.  People that care deeply enough about you that they sacrifice their time and effort to connect with you. Godspeed", "I took it in college and as with any language its 'Use it or Lose it' and not having anyone, definitely lost it. Bummer too", "There are lots of YouTube channels and things like that that are a good starting place. The hearing and speech center or even community center for your area if you have one will often have classes - go do it! I took several years from a community college interpreter program and while that was almost two decades ago, I still remember enough that I could have a basic conversation with someone. It\u2019s a great skill to have.", "It's so fun to learn too. I learned from a student in high school.", ">Amanda doesn't want to learn to sign because she doesn't want to communicate with your daughter.\n\nShe's perfectly happy with the fact that Ruby can hear what she has to say, but she definitely is not willing to listen to Ruby.  Not a good sign.", "This is the kind of thing where I'd start thinking back over interactions my brother has had with my daughter.  Has he actually made all that much effort to be able to communicate with her?  Or has he tended to \\*talk at\\* her, but not spend that much time around her (such as at family gatherings where there may be a lot of people).", "OP literally said in the post that she is able to use other methods of communication but that it\u2019s frustrating for her, which is valid. However, your argument that she just needs to communicate some other way because it works for your kid isn\u2019t valid. You don\u2019t know OP\u2019s daughter, you cannot group her with your own child just because your child is non verbal. There\u2019s a difference between being non verbal and mute. It\u2019s on the adult to find ways to interact with children.", "9 months into their relationship but only intro'd the kids 3 months ago. Unless you're a natural linguist, and they've practically been living together to practice/use it and live it daily, that's not a lot of time to fully learn a new language.\n\nThe question for me is, can they communicate? Because I've time the GF will likely pick up more. Forcing and pressuring her when she might be struggling isn't going to help.", "I think the AH part comes in when OP starts insulting her because of the mismatch.  This is reading far too into something we don't have enough info on, but there's a chance Amanda hates learning sign language because of the way OP is teaching it.", "I think getting 9 minutes into a serious relationship without mentioning you have a disabled child who will need significant accomodation on the partners part, and that this something you expect as a minimum, is where the mismatch happened.", "Maybe, if it was necessary. The kid can understand her. It's not necessary. It's not like she's refusing to help push someone in a wheelchair, who also has no arms. She's not saying, \"Fuck you.\" She's saying the bulk of communication shouldn't be on me, and it shouldn't.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much picking up a language as the fact she\u2019s proclaimed she\u2019s done trying. If surrounded by it, eventually even a log could learn a sign or two. Her refusal is the fly in the punch bowl.", "*its a sign of respect* \n\nGood one", "I understand what your thinking is here but I think that's putting an unfair burden on the daughter.  Daughter knows her dad likes this woman and may be reticent to tell her true feelings.", "Not really the same because nothing is also stopping the daughter in that scenario from learning spanish. Ruby can't learn to speak as a mute.", "[deleted]", "I agree. I'd say the relationship just isn't one that can work.", "It is, if you need that language to communicate with people who should be important to you.\n\nLearning a language can be hard, but everyone did it once, so they could do it again if needed.", "No, it's not \"hard\" for mute people to speak.  They are disabled.\n\nMaybe Amanda is intellectually disabled, in which case I'd give her a pass, but then OP is the asshole for taking advantaged of a disabled woman.", "This statement right here, \u201c\u2026adult putting the burden\u2026on a child.\u201d sums it up perfectly to me.", "To be fair, we don\u2019t know how much ASL she has already learned, what her personal learning abilities are like, what free time she has in the day, or any other factors other than OP has decided she is lazy and selfish. I am not going to judge her because we honestly don\u2019t know what her story is.", "That's true. After I posted I thought \" don't put a kid in an adult disagreement\".", "It is the same thing because in the vein of this conversation no one here would say a young child age daughter needs to learn a language to connect with her fathers girlfriend. If Amanda made that post, she would universally be the AH.", "It\u2019s not the same language. ASL is it\u2019s own distinct language. SEE is signed exact English which is signing the exact words you\u2019re saying. ASL has it\u2019s own grammar and syntax. \n\nNow the GF should at least be able to pick up a few basic signs that help her communicate but learning ASL is going to take a while because it is in fact leaning a whole new language.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really fair to say it\u2019s the same language or that it\u2019s easy. It is definitely a different language and not everyone picks up languages quickly. We disagree and that\u2019s ok but I do think folks need to acknowledge this seems very hard for Amanda and it\u2019s only been 3 months. OP can certainly break up if he dislikes it but I\u2019m not faulting someone for not learning a new language after 3 months. Seriously dating and relationships are hard and this is a huge hurdle to put on someone so soon. Perhaps OP should be looking for women already versed in ASL to some degree or ones who are fast to learn new languages.", ">It's the SAME language! Just with gestures.\n\nASL is a completely different language from English, with its own sentence structure. It's absolutely not the same language on any level.", "I said that already in my first comment that he\u2019s NTA and followed up with the relationship being done. I was just responding to OPs question in his comment:", "I think it was better this way anyway, if you had waited a year to introduce them then you would\u2019ve been more involved when you discovered she didn\u2019t want to put the effort. NTA.", "She's an adult with I'd assume her own personal life. \n\nWhen are she and OP going on dates? Are they all spent going over language? Is everything surrounding Ruby, or is OP also allowing his relationship with his GF to be something OTHER than a surrogate mother figure? \n\nIt sounds like she's been trying for 3 months, learning from OP, but she's struggling and frustrated that OP keeps pestering her on this.", "You know how hard it becomes to learn new languages when you are an adult? Specially something like this, she did put an effort but if she knows only basic words there's nothing else she can do.", "Bingo.\nMy momma was a ho!!! \nI get it.", "Ya legit same.", "My mom dated a married man. \nShe'd send us to church on Sunday so they could meet up.\nHis wife and 2 kids went to the same church...\nNow that's messed up!!! \nNow when I think about I kinda cringe."]}
