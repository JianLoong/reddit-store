We were to drive into the city, eat Italian, shop, then watch a movie before cooking dinner at home.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy boyfriend is the type to get \"hangry\", so he usually has a bite before we leave the house. He skipped his small snack yesterday, though.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen we got to the restaurant, it was closed for renovations. I felt the hangry clock ticking and I needed a solution quick. We got back in the car and drove to another restaurant. They had tables but it would be a 25-minute wait. Not too long for me, but who knows how Mr. Hangry would feel. He looks fine with it, so I confirm the table and its 25-minute wait.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe wait for a minute before I get the idea that we should check another Italian restaurant in the area. I figured they might be able to seat us in less than 25 minutes. Before we got there, though, the previous restaurant texted us that our table was ready. So we went back.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt the table, my boyfriend is in complete distress by his hangriness. He can't even speak. He apologizes in advance for being rude, and that he just needs to get some food in him. He asks where the bathroom is, but since the restaurant is a maze, I offered to take him.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen we got back to our table, without hesitation he asks, \"Did we order yet?? \ud83d\ude29\" We haven't ordered yet, of course. Now I'm feeling like taking him to the bathroom was a bad decision because otherwise I would have been able to order and fix his hunger sooner.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy boyfriend looked at the menu, but due to his headache, put it down and told me, \"Just order for me. You know this place. I'll just have what you're having.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\"Easy enough,\" I thought. I ordered some of my favorite dishes. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen our waiter left the table, my boyfriend asked me, snarkily, \"Did you forget I wasn't eating cheese?\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nImmediately, I apologize for dropping the ball! I totally forgot. I told him to please order something else. We could call the waiter back and fix this right now. My boyfriend said it's fine and that he'll eat cheese -- it's not a big deal. I said it's a big deal to me and since he's helped me stick to my own diet, \"I feel especially bad.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHis response: \"You should feel bad.\" This is when things turned south. I was already apologizing for dropping the ball, and he was making me feel additionally bad on top of it. He says this comment was a joke, but I told him that there's no way I would have thought he was making a joke with the attitude he had leading up to it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI started to cry at the table before asking for the check. How embarrassing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI spent the whole day trying to do something nice; and the whole thing feels ruined because my boyfriend can't control his attitude when he's hungry.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDid I really do such a bad thing by forgetting that my boyfriend was trying to stay away from cheese?", "created_utc": 1671377769, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp18ew/aita_for_forgetting_about_my_boyfriends_new/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He made what appears to be a conscious decision to let it ride just so he could make a snarky comment and use the error as ammunition against you.\n\nMaybe it's because he was hangry in the moment as you say, but that feels excuse-y to me. Also, I'm sitting here thinking, in an Italian restaurant, wouldn't MOST dishes have some sort of cheese and/or cream component? Why didn't he remind you of this new dietary restriction before you even got there?", "NTA. First, we can all get a little hangry but this guy was acting like he was approaching starvation. Absolutely no need for such amateur dramatics. Also, a grown man can remember to have a snack.\n\nSecondly, he should have reminded you he wasn\u2019t eating cheese before you ordered, or stepped in when he realised you were ordering cheese dishes. Instead he acted like a child and decided to get snarky afterwards instead of using his words and acting like an adult. \n\nHonestly, this guy sounds petulant, exhausting and borderline abusive. \n\nIs the low dairy diet a medical thing? If not he\u2019s even more of an asshole than he already was.", "NTA, but your boyfriend seems to want a lot of ... parenting from you.   He's 27 years old. I get that this was a date that you'd planned, but there's still a lot of him not taking ownership for his wants, dietary needs, and even his ability to locate the bathroom. \n\nFor me, this would be a red flag in the relationship: you need to decide if it is for you.", "NTA \n\nPlease, please reconsider this whole relationship. \n\nThere are 4 year olds that don't behave like this. \n\n>\"Just order for me. You know this place. I'll just have what you're having.\"\n\nThis part stood out to me. He's weaponised his incompetence, dumped the work on you *and* expected you to only order what adhered to his diet for yourself. He didn't mention the dairy thing until *after* you'd ordered and then just bitched at you about it, rather than trying to rectify *his* problem. He was just out for a fight.\n\nHe's not going to get any better. You don't deserve to waste anyore of your life on this childish jerk.", "NTA and your boyfriend needs to grow up. You made an honest mistake in all of the chaos. He couldve spoken up beforehand to remind you. Or he could've spoken up before the waiter left. Moreover, he could learn to control his emotions like a rational adult. Are you his boyfriend or his parent? Support is nice. He's expecting a lot more than support here, though. You seem sweet and I hope you recognize these things as red flags.

So it's normal to forget about it now and then, for as long you try to fix it as soon (which you did).\n\nAnd besides, he told you that he couldn't eat cheese right away after the waiter has gone, meaning that he has heard your order, right? Then he could've easily interrupted and asked the waiter which menu doesn't have cheese in it instead of waiting for you to finish the order.", "NTA - to be frank about it, I don\u2019t like how he treated you when you apologized.  If he takes pleasure in your distress WHEN not IF you misstep (being human and all) then this is not the man for you.", "NTA. It felt like I was reading about you and your 6-year-old son.", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn't have to babysit him and hold his hand just because he's \"hangry\". He's old enough, he needs to get a grip and stop acting like a baby. This \"hangry\" thing is a bullshit excuse for him to act out and get away with it, and you're enabling this immature behavior. \n\nYou're only 5 months in, he's showing you loud and clear who he is - believe him. Is this how you really want your relationship to go? Constantly walking on eggshells because he can't grow up and act like a grown man? The sex cannot possibly be good enough to warrant sticking around for this shit.", "I say this with love OP but you need to reconsider this relationship, your BF is a grown man yet acted like a toddler because he was hungry. If he has such a significant bodily reaction to less than 3hrs without eating he needs to be seen by a medical professional.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nSounds like the guy set himself up for failure. Could have easily stopped for a snack somewhere.", "NTA...but his behavior isn't ok. He was there, as you ordered, right? He could have, at any point, reminded you he changed his diet.", "NTA, mistakes happen. You did everything you could to plan and help the situation. My partner is the same way in needing food after a certain amount of time or else she\u2019d feel pretty bad physically then emotionally. I understand the emotions associated with that but that doesn\u2019t excuse being rude and disrespectful. Your bf needs to learn how to control his actions despite his feelings.", "NTA - but I'd reconsider this relationship and talk to him. He apologizes in advance for being rude? I mean seriously, he's already selfaware of being rude - instead of apologizing \"in advance\" he should rather work on not being rude, hangry or not. He's a grown adult acting like a helpless child...\n\nMistakes like that can happen, and you offered to fix it right away same as apologizing. I don't think you did anything wrong.

Yeah being hungry sucks but it's not like you lose complete control. Seems like he uses the hangry excuse to get away with such bad behaviour.

If your boyfriend deals with hunger that badly, it's his responsibility to manage it by having snacks with him and eating regularly. It is in no way the responsibility of people around him to manage his hunger, and if he asks you to order for him, he can't expect to get exactly what he wants.

Hangry doesn't force you to be rude, you know. See previous paragraph for a cool coping strategy.\n\nHe then delayed getting food!
