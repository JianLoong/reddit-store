I know I'm in a minority on this sub, but I think surprise parties are incredibly hostile gestures. This one even more so, given your circumstances.

A BIG part of planning a surprise party is making sure the honored guest is able to attend.\n\nSounds like you family planned what was convenient for themselves with little to no thought about your schedule and crushing work load that you need to complete (without distraction) in order to graduate.\n\nI\u2019m sorry your family is so self absorbed and unaware. You deserve better.", "NTA \n\nThis is piss poor planning on their part, if you\u2019re going to plan a surprise party for someone then the key element is making sure that it\u2019s held on a date that works for the guest of honour", "NTA. This party was never about you, it was about them. They know you have a lot on your plate, they know you hate surprises. They didn\u2019t care. They are trying to guilt you so that they don\u2019t look bad. You graduating is more important than how they look to the rest of the family.

Turn off your phone (unless you need it for your project) and focus on finishing school.

Get your work out the way, and it will all be over soon, and you can relax before starting to stress that you're getting married \n\nOn another note get some sleep as soon as you can. Speaking as someone that was once in a similar position to you, the lack of sleep coupled together with the stress can cause a blackout at the worst time. I know someone that had a blackout whilst driving on a road with 3 lanes of traffic in both directions because of how much stress they were under and how tired they got", "NTA. The thing about wedding is that this tend to be for the family and not for the couple.

You made it extremely clear you could not attend any gatherings, so it shouldn\u2019t have been expected of you to do so.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t like surprises, I\u2019m sure your family was aware of that and they\u2019re the AHs for throwing a surprise party *on top* of expecting you to be at the gathering you said you wouldn\u2019t be attending.\n\nAgain, you are NTA", "I mean this isn't how suprise parties work... \n\nYou make sure the person is available, you schedule something \"less party worthy\", so that you know they can attend and lead them to the surprise. \nJust throwing a party with the expectation that you will attend when you have already declined and being upset that you don't come is ridiculous, your are NTA. \n\nThey should have made sure you could commit to the date ahead of time and worked around you, especially as the guest of honor. \n\nThat you do or do not appreciate surprise parties is a whole other debate imo.", "Info: are you the first member of your family to attend college?

The problem was, nobody really told us about it. My in-laws' anniversary is in August and ours is in September. They told us in July they were thinking of having a lunch for their anniversary in August at this lodge near their house (90 min. from us). Two weeks later, they called my husband at work to tell him the lunch was on this date. Husband of course forgets the call as he's in the middle of work stuff. There's no mention of this lunch in any subsequent conversations with anyone. A month later, we're chilling at home when we get a call asking us where we were. Two hours later we show up and both of our families are there, pissed that we're so late. No one said anything to us because apparently we're so clever we could figure out that my in-laws hosting a party at their favorite restaurant on their actual anniversary (a month before ours) was obviously a surprise party for us \ud83d\ude44 and no one wanted to spoil the surprise.", "Oh don't you just love to be invited to parties by people screaming abuse at you.\n\nNTA, concentrate on your exams.

As someone who will ALSO be getting married during my last semester of undergrad next year, it is SO important to have a healthy balance between school obligations and planning/prep/celebration.

If you already know they don't...then don't.", "Yeah, that hasn't happened with my husband because he knows it would be a hellish landscape of dystopian terror if he tried to throw me a surprise party.

Have a wonderful wedding and a wonderful life.", "So, here is some tea! I just joined Reddit because this is my fianc\u00e9. I am appalled by the way the family reacted when they knew the situation.
