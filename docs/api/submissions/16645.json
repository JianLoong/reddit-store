I told them that I appreciated them putting the event together, but I should have been aware of the event ahead of time due to my tight schedule and the fact that I hate surprise parties all together. My mother and father have been screaming at me over the phone, telling me I'm a horrible person for having to reschedule. But my assignments are less than a day away, and I only have a rough draft completed. I feel horrible, but If I want to graduate on time, I can't take the entire evening off to attend.

I know I'm in a minority on this sub, but I think surprise parties are incredibly hostile gestures. This one even more so, given your circumstances. Your family is going to have to suck it up, this is entirely on them.\n\nGood luck on the end of your semester, and congratulations on your wedding!", "NTA. You have a lot on your plate with work, school, and planning a wedding. It was not fair for your family to plan a surprise party without consulting your schedule first, especially since you had already informed your mother at the beginning of the week that you wouldn't be able to attend a family gathering.", "Key element of a surprise party is to make sure it works for the guest of honor. \n\nNTA", "NTA - you told your parents you could not go and they didnt care. It seems they feel the bridal shower is more about them then, you know... the bride.", "NTA. They should have communicated with you. Don't go and good luck on your schoolwork!", "NTA. Wow. A BIG part of planning a surprise party is making sure the honored guest is able to attend.\n\nSounds like you family planned what was convenient for themselves with little to no thought about your schedule and crushing work load that you need to complete (without distraction) in order to graduate.\n\nI\u2019m sorry your family is so self absorbed and unaware. You deserve better.", "NTA \n\nThis is piss poor planning on their part, if you\u2019re going to plan a surprise party for someone then the key element is making sure that it\u2019s held on a date that works for the guest of honour", "NTA. This party was never about you, it was about them. They know you have a lot on your plate, they know you hate surprises. They didn\u2019t care. They are trying to guilt you so that they don\u2019t look bad. You graduating is more important than how they look to the rest of the family. If they really wanted this for you then they would have rescheduled the first time you said you couldn\u2019t make it. Don\u2019t risk graduating on time to make them look good.

Now get back to work!\n\nSeriously, don\u2019t waste your precious time today worrying about their poor planning. Turn off your phone (unless you need it for your project) and focus on finishing school. You told them you couldn\u2019t attend, they know you\u2019re about to graduate, it should be obvious that you\u2019re really busy right now. It is NOT your problem that they chose not to believe you.", "NTA\n\nNTA!!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I told my mother I would not be able to attend\" .. You TOLD THEM. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour parents are the AHs here - refuse to let them guilt you, this is THEIR fault.", "NAH - You can\u2019t make the party due to school demands.   They were unaware of your availability.  You did nothing wrong, nor did they until the \u201cyelling part\u201d.  Reschedule, it\u2019s that simple.

Get your work out the way, and it will all be over soon, and you can relax before starting to stress that you're getting married \n\nOn another note get some sleep as soon as you can. Speaking as someone that was once in a similar position to you, the lack of sleep coupled together with the stress can cause a blackout at the worst time. I know someone that had a blackout whilst driving on a road with 3 lanes of traffic in both directions because of how much stress they were under and how tired they got", "NTA.
