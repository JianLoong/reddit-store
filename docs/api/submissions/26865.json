This is you establishing a \"private stash\" of junk food and liquor **to satisfy your addictions.**\n\nYour boyfriend is right to be concerned about this behaviour. And by your own admission, others are also concerned. All these relationships are being harmed, realize that.  \n\nI won't judge you an asshole, but you should think about working with a professional to talk about your feelings around the situation.", "I think you need to see a therapist.", "NTA, but if you're using booze in the fridge as a crutch or safety net - \"I like knowing it's there and I xan drink when I want to\", you might need to be a bit more concerned.  That implies you think about drinking and feel safe knowing you have booze around at all times. Slippery slope, said as someone who is related to raging drunks (alcoholics go to meetings).\n\nNot sure why the BF says you're ruining his life, or your lives, by having it.  Are you certain this isn't a control issue?  If he's that angry about snacks, this is not a \"concerned about my health\" kind of behavior.", "ESH. You should have the agency to consume what you wish, but you seem unwilling to take seriously the concerns of others.", "NTA. It's super weird, but that's nothing to get pissy about. You do you", "NTA\n\nHis conveying a concern is one thing if done politely/respectfully, but policing your own private \"stash\" of snacks and alcohol is the AH behavior.  Unless there is a whole lot missing to back up when he says \"its ruining our lives\" I don't see it in your post.", "Nta but I strongly suggest speaking to a therapist. You deserve to not be controlled by food.", "Therapy.", "Add me on to the list of people criticizing you for indulging your addiction without making any effort to fix it. YTA.", "YTA because ofc he is not going to like you enabling your various addictions. you are destroying yourself and your relationship along with it. please seek help.", "Food safety and access is a huge issue for me as well. I always keep my own separate stash of food in my room bc I was starved as a kid. While some people might think this is weird, different people have different needs and standards. There\u2019s nothing wrong with doing what works for you, as long as you don\u2019t hurt yourself or anyone else\n\nIf there\u2019s a legitimate concern about alcohol use/abuse that\u2019s a separate issue. If everyone in your life is saying the same thing you might want to listen to whatever reasons they have. If it just boils down to \u201cwe think that\u2019s weird\u201d you\u2019re probably fine, but if they\u2019re concerned you\u2019re hurting yourself it might be time for some tough conversations.\n\nNTA", "NAH.  Drinking alone and hiding food and alcohol are warning behaviors indicating a problem and this behavior is affecting your relationship.  \n\nWhy not just store the food and alcohol in the same area and take the feedback?  If \"everyone\" is saying you have a problem, it's likely you have a problem and need to talk to a mental health professional to get to the root of it.", "YTA. This is straight alcoholism.  My fridge often has a \"General\"  (1.75L) of rum (Captain Morgan)  in it, and I could go through one in a week. I'm having a hard time imagine that \"not being enough.\"  An entire fridge?", "NTA.  People have quirks.  Yours is less dangerous than a lot of people's.  Tell your BF to lighten up.  I'm sure he has some quirks, too.", "YTA- but because you know you have a problem and are refusing to do anything about it. To the point it\u2019s causing problems in your relationships.", "NTA.\n\nHe can buy his own mini fridge etc and stock his own stuff. Fairs fair. The problem with him blowing his top at you and your own stuff and doing actual things that is for YOURSELF and strictly shared with very few with you in your space is a problem of itself in him.\n\nI have fed the world. I feed people waifs in particular usually in secret. So that a whole town of them dont mob me seeking the same. So I keep a seperate stock.\n\nI maintain a fridge for non frozen stuff pending cooking and also for the wine. Thats it. The deep freezer and ice section maintains long term storage. The Mini Fridge as it was in trucking in its cabinet is useful for dangerous monster food days. I close the door with a note on there keeping everyone else out and proceed to be a monster.\n\nIts not pretty. Key words some days. So its useful for segregating the foods related to that away from the normal groceries for everyone in the home.", "NTA, but this isn't healthy behavior.  Either you're harming yourself physically, in which case you may want to speak to a therapist to unpack this behavior, or your boyfriend is a control freak, in which case you should either dump him or see a couples counselor.  We can't say which is at issue from your testimony alone.", "NTA as somebody who grew up with food insecurities, I think it\u2019s not that big of a deal.  I hide snacks everywhere in my house. My kids know it\u2019s okay to eat hidden snacks just not the last one.", "Kinda weird but NTA. I think you should try to get help for your food addictions. If they are impairing your relationships, its a problem that should be dealt with. Good luck.", "NTA", "NTA but you\u2019re going to eat yourself out of a boy friend", "I see nothing wrong with this. I'd test a theory, though. Move everything into the kitchen. Leave your shit empty and see how much of your stuff he goes through. \n\nI bet you he'll eat and drink some of it. \n\nI find it weird that you guys judge a person for a personal food stash. \n\nYall have weird porn stashes, weird toy stashes, etc. Judging a person for keeping a mini fridge and their own pantry? Seriously, some of you need to get a life. \n\nIf you aren't hurting yourself, or anyone else your partner needs to figure out his weird emotional damage he has. So goofy to be mad over this.", "You soumd like you have have an issue\n \nNTA is my judgement. here pertaining to the post, but this behavior is concerning \n\nYour bF IS NTA too", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Are you binging huge amounts of food or alcohol regularly, inducing vomiting, or otherwise risking your health? Are you constantly out of money for household expenses due to maintaining your food and alcohol cache?

This is clearly more than just somebody butting in to nag OP to eat a more well-balanced diet. If \"every single person\" in your life has expressed concern, it's likely a big problem.\n\nOP, you're not an asshole, but you need help. It sounds like you're depressed and have anxiety, and you're using food (and likely alcohol) to medicate yourself. This isn't uncommon, but it's also not very effective and causes a lot more problems in the long run. Please get a therapist who can help you work through what's really going on. If that seems like too big a step to do on your own, reach out and ask your bf and/or family to help facilitate it.  A therapist isn't going to make you stop eating how you want to eat, so don't let that fear keep you from getting help. They're going to help you work through your issues and possibly get you medication if necessary with the goal of you being happier and living a more well-rounded life. \n\nNAH", "It could also be as simple as \"when I want a glass of wine its nice knowing I won't have to run to the store\" I wouldn't necessarily jump to alcoholic because really an alcoholic wouldn't be drinking as little as OP.

Mayne people even have wine cellars, or have a several bottles of wine in the pantry. \n\nThse people aren't alcoholics. They enjoy having a drink whenever they want, and like op, they like knowing the alcohol is their so they ca drink whenever they want, and don't have to go to the store. \n\nJust because someone has a stash of alcohol in their house doesn't make them an alcoholic.", "Eh I also like to just keep alcohol around so I have it, it\u2019s nice to know it\u2019s there if I want it, especially because it\u2019s not as easy to buy it here as where I grew up. I have to go to a special store a bit out of my way and I don\u2019t like taking a lot of trips there. The alcohol is just there in case I want a drink or people come over.

I know the addiction will always be there but man way to kick someone who's proud lmao.", "And I didn't say you did either. I only responded to what you commented. I mentioned it because you offered no other alternative (in your comment) to the alcohol fridge.", "I'm not looking to \"kick someone who's proud\".  I've met too many addicts that claim they're \"former\" addicts who still use their drug of choice.  I've met a lot of drunks who think, act, and say they're \"former alcoholics\".  I've sat through Alanon. I've read the book, the pamphlets, heard from those.   No addict is ever \"former\".  You're just not actively using.  That monkey is happy to jump on your back and dig in any day you let it.  You don't have it in a cage, on a string, or organ grinding at your command.\n\nI didn't say there was no other option.  I said it is a slippery slope to think of booze and feel safe knowing you have access to it.  Same goes for coke, meth, weed, food, porn, caffeine, adrenaline.  They're all able to be addicted to, they're all able to be slippery slopes."]}
