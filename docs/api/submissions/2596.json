We had to book excursions well in advance on the website as there was limited space on each.\n\nOn the water excursions, we\u2019re told to wear thin, light clothing over swimming attire if we have it, because no matter what, you\u2019re gonna get wet. A couple days into the cruise and after white water rafting, I start my period, which means no more swimming in the open pool, which I\u2019m fine with. \n\nHowever, the night before the second excursion, kayaking, my mother, who\u2019s sharing a cabin with me, tells me not to go as I\u2019m on my period and she doesn\u2019t want me to \u201cembarrass myself.\u201d I say that I\u2019ve missed out on too many good things in life for fear of \u201cembarrassing myself\u201d (read; because of HER fear of me embarrassing myself) and I\u2019m not going to miss out on an adventure because of it. Even if anyone sees the blood, I\u2019m not going to see those people again, so what does it matter?\n\nShe gets annoyed at that, saying \u201coh you think it\u2019s okay because you\u2019re never going to see those people again?\u201d I reply \u201c\u2026 yes?\u201d She goes OFF, calling me immature and that I don\u2019t have my priorities in order.

Keep in mind, the excursions had to be booked months in advance, and it\u2019s a whole rigmarole to exchange tickets, so I can\u2019t change just like that, nor do I want to.\n\nI scoff and told her to get over herself, which only ticks her off even more.

AITA?\n\nEdit: Since people are mentioning tampons, I should clarify that I\u2019ve always worn pads as I can\u2019t get anything up there. Pads are more prone to slippage and bleed-through, especially when you get wet, but in the end I just wore two in a T-formation.\n\nEdit 2: A few people are saying my mother\u2019s/parents\u2019 views are old-fashioned and the like, and I don\u2019t disagree, but I\u2019ll mention here that my parents are both from Syria, so it\u2019s fair to say they were raised pretty conservatively - hell, my mother\u2019s family was on the more liberal end of the spectrum since her father strongly spoke in favour of girls and women being well-educated and going to university.
