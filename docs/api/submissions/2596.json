We had to book excursions well in advance on the website as there was limited space on each.\n\nOn the water excursions, we\u2019re told to wear thin, light clothing over swimming attire if we have it, because no matter what, you\u2019re gonna get wet. A couple days into the cruise and after white water rafting, I start my period, which means no more swimming in the open pool, which I\u2019m fine with. \n\nHowever, the night before the second excursion, kayaking, my mother, who\u2019s sharing a cabin with me, tells me not to go as I\u2019m on my period and she doesn\u2019t want me to \u201cembarrass myself.\u201d I say that I\u2019ve missed out on too many good things in life for fear of \u201cembarrassing myself\u201d (read; because of HER fear of me embarrassing myself) and I\u2019m not going to miss out on an adventure because of it. Even if anyone sees the blood, I\u2019m not going to see those people again, so what does it matter?\n\nShe gets annoyed at that, saying \u201coh you think it\u2019s okay because you\u2019re never going to see those people again?\u201d I reply \u201c\u2026 yes?\u201d She goes OFF, calling me immature and that I don\u2019t have my priorities in order. She even went as far as to call me ungrateful as she was paying for the cruise (which is only technically partially true - my parents share an account and my dad used it to pay for himself and her, but my brother paid for the bulk of it). Keep in mind, the excursions had to be booked months in advance, and it\u2019s a whole rigmarole to exchange tickets, so I can\u2019t change just like that, nor do I want to.\n\nI scoff and told her to get over herself, which only ticks her off even more. Her last words to me that night are that she had \u201cnever seen an ungrateful child like me.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, she doesn\u2019t join us for breakfast and I tell my brother and father what happened. My father says that she goes off because she loves me and my brother and wants us to do well, and that we need to understand her and that my reaction to her concerns was dismissive and unfair. \n\nNow I\u2019m second guessing myself and whether I should\u2019ve been more understanding. AITA?\n\nEdit: Since people are mentioning tampons, I should clarify that I\u2019ve always worn pads as I can\u2019t get anything up there. Pads are more prone to slippage and bleed-through, especially when you get wet, but in the end I just wore two in a T-formation.\n\nEdit 2: A few people are saying my mother\u2019s/parents\u2019 views are old-fashioned and the like, and I don\u2019t disagree, but I\u2019ll mention here that my parents are both from Syria, so it\u2019s fair to say they were raised pretty conservatively - hell, my mother\u2019s family was on the more liberal end of the spectrum since her father strongly spoke in favour of girls and women being well-educated and going to university.

The OP already said she's not using the pool.  But in open water that would bother you?", "\u2026\n\nYour mom did that to YOU at 9?

It's pricey but well worth it and if you take good care of it, it does last a while.", "I'm just gonna chime in here, with the precursor that I'm a dude and definitely do not understand periods as well as women do, but there was an episode on some local TV a while ago where the presenter tried to make it look like she had started \"leaking\" through her pads and who would go up to her and say something in public. \n\nTwo things I found out:   \n\\- It takes a hell of a lot of blood to be actually visible. I'm talking a half bottle of red dye dumped straight into the inside of some sweatpants before it's properly visible. Leading me to the conclusion that accidents do definitely happen, but it doesn't happen as quick as some people think.\n\n\\- Old ladies are the first to say something.", "well that's all well and fine but neither here nor there as she was already on about her business when it began. it's gtk for next time but not as though she could have snagged a pair while already several days into a white water rafting trip. i know it's just a helpful tip and maybe i'm being a bit defensive just want to point out it quite likely wasn't an option at the time.", "If you\u2019re sharing a raft or a kayak then yeah, the water always pools in the bottom and you always fall in to the open water and get soaked, to it\u2019s not like OP will stay dry and it not be and issue. The water in the bottom of the raft or kayak is going to be unhygienic.", "Whoa there, stop. Just stop. I was a child who\u2019d never heard anything about periods before I started bleeding (we all knew about the boobs and babies side of puberty but never this), she was explaining to me what it was and what to do about it, both pads and tampons. I didn\u2019t view it as much different to a mother wiping a child\u2019s butt for them because they\u2019re too young to know how to do it themselves.", "A tampon is way easier than a cup imo. Small tampons are pretty much the width of fingers.", "No shame at all, just sharing a possible solution based on personal experience. About 2 months ago my niece told me she was having trouble with tampons. The ones her mom uses have like this muffin top of cotton at the head sticking out of the applicator (which my sister ususes because our mom used that kind, and sometimes young women don\u2019t know what options are).

It could potentially impair your ability to get optimum health screenings for cervical (and potentially ovarian, when they do a bimanual exam) cancer.

Big hugs.", "It's been a long time since I've thought of period huts. Before I was married with children I thought this was barbaric, and now I think these people were onto something that could be blissful...Because fuck do periods suck and I just want to be left alone in my misery.", "If you can get your finger in then tampon should most likely work also. I was 19/20 when I finally got a hang of tampons. It wasn\u2019t until I talked to a friend and learned that I wasn\u2019t inserting the applicator in deep enough before pushing the sliding part in. Which resulted in the tampon half sticking out. My mistake was either holding the applicator right outside my vagina or only inserting it slightly. Learning how to do it was a game changer. \n\nSome tampons are also easier. I\u2019m nearly 30 now and I recently had to buy small/compact tampons while traveling and I can\u2019t properly figure out how to use those still \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAll this to say, try a few diffeeent brands in case that\u2019s the issue and make sure you\u2019re following the instructions properly.

Which is totally fine, people shouldn't feel any pressure to use tampons or cups if it's not comfortable. But also if you do go with tampons, I hope you will consider organic cotton at least as regular tampons tend to have pesticides and lots of synthetic things you may not want to tuck up there. Just saying putting things inside is not always the best option for everyone either but I definitely agree it would be good to talk to a doc about it and see if you're dealing with anything medical. Sorry OP went through this it sounds very frustrating and stressful!", "It doesn\u2019t matter the purpose. Vaseline is not good for the vagina and should not be used under any circumstances.

And I'm queer too, so I don't mean sex with men.\n\nA \"tilted\" uterus (I had to check the English word to make sure it was the same thing I knew about, the scientific term is retroverted btw) is temporary, it normally tilts forward (anteverted, like it's supposed to be) on its own. My uterus has been tilted back before and it had gone back to normal by my next gyno appointment the following year. It's very possible your uterus being retroverted had nothing to do with how your tampons sat, because it's very possible it wasn't at the time. Check you old gyno reports from before you were pregnant, they should always write if your uterus is anteverted or retroverted, but it's unlikely they don't say it out loud when it's retroverted.", "Huh, I\u2019m 23 and never been to the ob (I know it\u2019s really bad) because I\u2019m terrified of that stuff, because I\u2019ve had panic attacks trying to put tampons in and have trouble inserting anything else as well. I\u2019ve been using pads for 11 years and struggling through the \u201cawkward backing out of pool days\u201d dance.

You've already said what needs to be said. She does indeed need to get over herself.

If anything people should be more aware and destigmatize the embarrassment of periods.", "NTA", "I was going to say N-t-a, until you said you only use pads, which was a bit of a \"huh, not sure how I feel about that\" due to mental images of someone essentially free-bleeding into shared water I'm also in and it getting on me. So I'm going NAH because mom's concerns make sense. She is also correct that your nonchalance would probably evaporate into mortification if you wound up looking like you sat in an entire jar of strawberry jam because the water diluted and spread things, strangers or no.\n\nWith kayaking and white water rafting, your butt should, ideally, be firmly planted in your boat and stay there. Which means there would be zero issue with the above and no one would ever find out. \n\nThere is still the risk of what might happen if you flip your boat, though. But that's up to you to decide if the risk is an acceptable level. If you did flip into the water, the water would essentially be running very fast, reducing the ick factor violation (unlike if we were in the shared pool, for example. I would feel violated if I found out someone was getting their period blood or other bodily fluids on me) but I hope your pants are black and it's a light day, so if the worst happens, you'll be fine and get away with it unnoticed.\n\nMy ultimate verdict is that you are 22, and need to stop telling your mom when you're on your period.

There are even quizzes to help you find one that works for you. I *absolutely despised* the first cup I purchased but eventually found one that I can't feel at all.

I suggest putting a towel down on the bed and trying to lay down and putting one in.", "So.......\n\nNo, it definitely DOES NOT take an entire bottle of red dye. I bled through some pink pants (men's, so the quality was better and fabric was thicker), and it was 1/5 of an ounce. Also, if you are wearing a pad, and the pad isn't directly between your vulva and your pants, it gets on your pants. The pads sometimes move around.  \n\n\nYou were probably watching a segment on period underwear or something. Which are great, but pads are very easy to bleed through just by standing up sometimes.", "Have it checked by a gynecologist.

Uhmmmm.....okay....let me try and save this. Maybe the moral of the story is to wear baggy sweatpants cause it's difficult to \"leak through\"?", "Same, except tampons instead of (or in addition to) pads.", "This is a funny sidetrack tbh. First of all, if people knew they were gonna leak, they probably would just prevent it (although baggy sweatpants in a dark color would show leaks less than tighter or light colored pants). Also, what you are doing is important, because sitting and standing and laying down all cause different bleeding patterns. When doing water sports, the way leakage works is going to be pretty different than walking around. Kayaking is kind of sitting and being wet will also change how all that works too. \nThis was all just weird anecdotes. Tbh I think wet pads are pretty miserable in of themselves, period pants for water sports are definitely a great option for OP, but really only OP can weigh the risks for her circumstances.", "Im not saying you should.  I\u2019m saying it was wrong.", "Can someone explain to me the company saying \"light colored clothes\"?

Have tried period panties? They make swimsuits too.", "NTA. Wtf? LOL. So by her logic, when you\u2019re on your period, you have to shut down and stay inside the whole week every month? What kind of bs is this? I use pads instead of tampons so if I happen to be on my period, I just won\u2019t swim. I\u2019ll probably just dunk my feet in the pool or something. I can basically do any water activity as long as I\u2019m not dunking my whole body in. Never bled through and this is coming from someone with a HEAVY flow.", "NTA.  Just....nta.   You don't need to be understanding about someone else's opinion about YOUR BODY.", "NTA - But based on some of your comments, have you considered period panties.  They ace the same as a pad, but you wash them and there is less risk of leakage.  I had a friend who had to do something similar, but when she found these they were a game changer (super outdoorsy adventure girl, said her life has never been better).  Just something to consider in the future.", "NTA\n\nHopefully you will try tampons again, or a menstrual cup, they are so liberating.  Takes some practice, you'll get it down though.", "NTA I have endometriosis and you can't control a period for F*** sake!", "I just want to say I sympathize with you not being able to use a tampon. So many people like to suggest it and are very confused when I say I can\u2019t and that I don\u2019t wish to explain why.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, it\u2019s not their business, and it\u2019s not from trauma. I just seem to have a very narrow \u201carea\u201d and at best it makes me feel like I need to pee really badly the entire time it\u2019s in, and at worst it feels like sandpaper and feels very wrong. I hate them, even the smallest ones. A nurse once told me after look at my chart it\u2019s likely because I have a \u201cretro flexed uterus\u201d or something like that. Essentially there\u2019s like a curved angle going on there that makes it very uncomfortable. Idk if that\u2019s true or not, but it was very validating to finally have a medical person tell me I wasn\u2019t crazy for having an issue with tampons.\n\nSo this is more of a response to the tampon thing than the post. Frankly, nobody should make you feel bad for not wanting to use tampons. There\u2019s a big difference for some of us between using a pad and inserting something up our vaginas.
