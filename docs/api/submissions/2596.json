We had to book excursions well in advance on the website as there was limited space on each.\n\nOn the water excursions, we\u2019re told to wear thin, light clothing over swimming attire if we have it, because no matter what, you\u2019re gonna get wet. A couple days into the cruise and after white water rafting, I start my period, which means no more swimming in the open pool, which I\u2019m fine with. \n\nHowever, the night before the second excursion, kayaking, my mother, who\u2019s sharing a cabin with me, tells me not to go as I\u2019m on my period and she doesn\u2019t want me to \u201cembarrass myself.\u201d I say that I\u2019ve missed out on too many good things in life for fear of \u201cembarrassing myself\u201d (read; because of HER fear of me embarrassing myself) and I\u2019m not going to miss out on an adventure because of it. Even if anyone sees the blood, I\u2019m not going to see those people again, so what does it matter?\n\nShe gets annoyed at that, saying \u201coh you think it\u2019s okay because you\u2019re never going to see those people again?\u201d I reply \u201c\u2026 yes?\u201d She goes OFF, calling me immature and that I don\u2019t have my priorities in order.

Keep in mind, the excursions had to be booked months in advance, and it\u2019s a whole rigmarole to exchange tickets, so I can\u2019t change just like that, nor do I want to.\n\nI scoff and told her to get over herself, which only ticks her off even more.

AITA?\n\nEdit: Since people are mentioning tampons, I should clarify that I\u2019ve always worn pads as I can\u2019t get anything up there. Pads are more prone to slippage and bleed-through, especially when you get wet, but in the end I just wore two in a T-formation.\n\nEdit 2: A few people are saying my mother\u2019s/parents\u2019 views are old-fashioned and the like, and I don\u2019t disagree, but I\u2019ll mention here that my parents are both from Syria, so it\u2019s fair to say they were raised pretty conservatively - hell, my mother\u2019s family was on the more liberal end of the spectrum since her father strongly spoke in favour of girls and women being well-educated and going to university.

Unless you're doing swimming moves that forces water into your vagina, the air/water pressure and how we're designed keeps it in.  Unless you have a super heavy flow, where you probably don't want be doing anything anyway.  \n\n\nSource:  Me.  In high school, I had swimming class.  I also had a period that lasted the entire month of November.  Also, any woman with a period who has been in a bathtub.", "Genius. I wish I'd thought of that in my school days.", "I think that's why OP may be right to avoid swimming if she can't wear a tampon and doesn't have a period swimsuit. But in the open water activities OP describes, any blood is very likely to be washed away before it gets onto anyone.", "What about a pad and period underwear? I wear period underwear on my heaviest day/overnight and it\u2019s pretty durable. Just an idea!", "If you haven't had penetrative sex before you may have trouble. I did until I became sexually active. Otherwise you may want to see your Dr.", "I have had a terrible time with a cup and although I still use them more often than not, I don't find them trustworthy and always wear a back up pad. The cup evangelists are strident and annoying but you aren't alone.", "If it's not bothering you or affecting your life, it's not a big deal, the most likely medical reasons are entirely benign. The only concern is that it can make pap smears very difficult to do; next time you see your GP you may want to mention it just because of that. There are alternatives ways of screening for cervical cancer, but they're less sensitive and may have to be done more frequently.\n\nYou may have been told that if you're immunised against HPV and you've never had penetrative sex, you don't need pap screening. That's unfortunately not true; you're at lower risk of cervical cancer, but it still happens.", "You can deal with your period however you like but unless you are able to stop your periods medically you will deal with this for the next 30 yrs. I never was on birth control of any kind, I had a period every month for approx 40 yrs. I can't begin to calculate how many things I would've missed out on if I \nhad to use pads every month.  Please solve this problem so you can get on with your life.", "Came to write this. Was totally against before, but works wonders and nothing slips", "I have one, too. Sex has at times been painful because of it but I\u2019ve been able to wear a tampon. I don\u2019t know if my experience will work for anyone else but I find that if I bear down, I can insert a tampon easily. It\u2019s sort of like what you do when you need to go #2 where you push your rectal muscles but you do so with your lady parts. Works every time. I hope that made sense. Tampons have been life changing. I even moved to wearing a menstrual cup but the learning curve and comfort are steep. \n\nThey recently started making period swimsuits. I imagine those were meant for situations like this."]}
