While I\u2019ve heard mixed reactions, I feel comfortable enough with my actions to tell the world what took place. Every single Saturday for the last 8.5 years I\u2019ve gone shopping at my local Walmart, I\u2019ve never broken that streak and while that\u2019s unrelated to the story I\u2019m pretty proud of it. It was a Saturday like any other and I loaded up my grocery bags and headed down to Walmart. I was doing my usual routine, hitting the toiletries aisle first for toothpaste and floss and then over to the dairy section for milk and other products. When I arrived at the candy aisle (my father is a diabetic and I was picking up candy for his blood sugar.) I found this 8-10 year old kid raising his voice at his mother after she refused to purchase him a pack of chocolate bars. This wasn\u2019t your usual tantrum over a candy bar, this kid was full on calling his mom a \u201cuseless c*nt\u201d, \u201cstupid bitch\u201d and all the horrible names you can think of. I noticed this and initially decided to ignore it. Not my kid and who am I to parent someone else\u2019s child? I did however show how I felt about the situation on my face and that was when I was met by a smug \u201cthe fuck are you looking at pussy\u201d from this young child. I said excuse me and asked his mother where on earth he got this vile, vulgar and downright disrespectful vocabulary and she told me to mind my own business. I scoffed and started walking away when the spawn of Satan said \u201cyeah keep it moving bitch boy\u201d. I snapped. I looked the kid dead in the eye and I told him to shut his fucking mouth. The kid started to tremble and tear up a little. Of course it\u2019s just my luck that all anyone around heard was me telling this child to shut the fuck up. The kid broke down and I was escorted out of the Walmart and given a 6 month ban. AITA?

Kid needs to learn that actions have consequences and that it's really stupid to antagonize strangers. The fuck up was doing it in a way that got you caught.", "NTA. That little shit knew what the words he was saying meant. He just found out there are consequences for his horrible actions.", "NTA\nThe kid is going to have worse things happen to him than getting yelled at for taunting adults. Better he learn sooner than later.", "NTA\n\nBut this story is hilarious.", "NTA but I think you learned a lesson to either stay out of it or pick your words more carefully. I think you giving a look gave the kid no right to say that to you cause he did choose to involve you but I think my response would\u2019ve been something like.. you should treat your mother with more respect and also be careful what you say to strangers cause one day you could say something to the wrong person, then I would\u2019ve just smiled with direct eye contact and then I walked away. I don\u2019t think you would get banned for something like that.", "NTA how a child speaks to his mother is between them. How a child speaks to me is between us. Talk to me like that and have the parent take no action means I will. Actions have consequences.", "NTA This story is hard to believe, but if it's true then I would have shaken your hand on the spot. Someone had to put this little monster in his place. Not sure why you would be \"proud\" of your weekly shopping trips to Walmart, but depending on where you live I bet there is another Walmart fairly close. It is Walmart after all, those things are everywhere.", "I'm on the fence with this one. I can completely understand why you reacted like that. However you should probably learn to pick your fights. Yes, you took that kid down a peg which is clearly what he needs, but what did you gain from it? aside from an inconvenient ban from your local Walmart. Had you ignored the kid and walked away chances are you'd never had seen him again and your life would be unaffected. \n\nYou know what sod it - NTA. The kids a brat and deserved what he got.", "Wow that escalated. A moment of silence for the 8.5 year streak \ud83d\ude14\n\nIt\u2019s a weird situation. I work retail and I hate it when people swear at their kids, let alone it going both ways.\n\nTo be honest, I don\u2019t blame you for doing what you did, but you definitely could\u2019ve handled it better.", "You lost me at \"proud of going to Walmart every Saturday for 8.5 years.\"\n\nESH.", "Honestly yes yta but only because it\u2019s a child vs adult. But good lord I don\u2019t think you are wrong necessarily.", "Yta. I work at walmart, and I can see why they gave you the ban.\n\nWe have enough bad customers in the store, and you're making it worse when the mother asks you to mind her own business. \n\nThis could have escalated into something worse. I've learned as an associate 11(years)  and a customer that it's best to let people take care of their own things because 95% of the time, it could get blown up way too big, and it's not worth it.", "Congratulations, you managed to get yourself on a level of a worst-brought-up toddler in Walmart.

IRL Eric Cartman was being a pain, but for fucks sake you didn\u2019t need to get involved", "Yeah, YTA, although I totally get your reaction.\n\nYou can't fight back to a child as you would to an adult. It was also the last thing an employee at Walmart wishes for on a Saturday. And you didn't know anything about context or background. The kid may suffer from a condition of some kind. You should have stayed on the adult level.", "YTA mainly cause of the age gap \ud83d\ude05\nBut.. also this kid could have neurodivergent issues or anything sooo.

Not believable.", "NTA.... little shit will be in jail or prison soon......I wouldn't be too upset over a Walmart ban, I avoid that place like the plague, it's been years since I've been in one", "Agree with the NTA. \n\nCan\u2019t believe people are siding with the kid.

He just has no manners.", "One possible explanation. Could be Tourette or some form of autism, too. Or a way to cope with a recent loss. Or he is simply a spoiled brat. But you just can't know.", "This puts such a bad light onto people with autism or tourrette.... if your autistic child behaves like that. It is not the autism, it's how you raise them. And people with tourette have ticks. They don't abuse and cuss and yell on purpose. So the ticks would have been way less directed at the person and non intentional.", "You only know the interpretation or perception of the OP, towards which I directed my answer. Not what was actually happening.", "Even then. An autistic child can also behave. Being autistic is not a free pass to swear at and insult people. And tourette the mom could have cleared up with a quick \"sorry it's the tourette\". And again tourette would have been a tick and not a clear insult. Especially since the kid insulted based on gender and situation/action. \nDon't always try to put actual illnesses in bad light because some people can't properly raise their children. \n\nEven abuse through the father and too much age inappropriate media are more likely than the diseases you named."]}
