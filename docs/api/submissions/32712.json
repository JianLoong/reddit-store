I have been hospitalized because I got gestational diabetes. I shared a room with another women Gina, who also has gestational diabetes. \n\nWe started talking after vistor hours were over and I found out she is going to be a solo parent. I felt sorry for Gina, because no one came up to vist her and it does get lonely in here. Expecially at night. \n\nSo every time someone came to vist me, I made a point to introduce Ginw and include her in any conversation, I would have with my vistors and share food with her. Because let's face it! Hospital food is terrible! I wouldn't wish it on my worse enemy.\n\nSo to the main part off the situation. My husband always vists me after work and I did introduce them. He sometimes takes me out to eat on the weekends. I asked if it was okay with him, if I could invite Gina and he said he didn't mind. It was then I noticed, Gina started asking him to do simple things like help her put her coat on and helping her tie her shoes and asking him to help her off her bed or up get up out of a chair. (She had no problem doing theses thing's by herself before) \n\nThen when I had a sore back my husband gave me a massage. Gina also asked him for a massage. But he declined. She went quite and ignored us for the rest of the vist. After when he left, I apologized to her but said it was inappropriate that she asked that from him. Gina started crying and saying she sore to and why can't she have a massage and it's not fair. I said you made my husband very uncomfortable and to please not do that again! Gina just flared up and started calling me nasty names and screaming, I was insecure and the nurses came in and they had to calm her down. I absolutely refused to go back into the same room as her that night and I was put in another room. \n\nNext morning my husband came and I told him what happened. I told him not to help Gina anymore. He was shocked at her behavior and agreed. He took me out for a walk and on our way down we saw Gina and she asked my husband for help to get up and he politely declined and we walked away. When we came back to my ward, I went to get me a drink and saw Gina by herself in the corner crying. Now I'm feeling bad and wondering if AITA?", "created_utc": 1702178479, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18eucf3/aita_for_not_letting_my_husband_help_another/", "score": 755, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Birthing alone is not for the faint of heart.

It\u2019s crazy that someone they are keeping you in when you could just be resting and monitoring your blood sugar at home, and just contact the ward if you need it. \n\nI can understand your husband being uncomfortable with Gina\u2019s requests. However she is probably feeling very lonely and scared and saw the support and comforting that you were getting and just wanted a bit  herself. It\u2019s such a shame she isn\u2019t able to get any from her family.

I would certainly have been allowed to wander about when the drip wasn't active because they wanted me up and moving... However, they would not have allowed me in and out of the hospital....

I\u2019m not pregnant neither had kids so idk how it works. \n\nBut I\u2019m sure that if you get hospitalised you do it get to go in and out from the hospital to have dinner, and usually if you are hospitalised for diabetes you can eat food that isn\u2019t from the hospital.

I had gestational diabetes, and it just required some extra scans and appointments to check the baby was developing okay. If your GD is bad enough that you\u2019ve been hospitalised, you wouldn\u2019t be going out to eat with your partner.", "I've had it twice, each pregnancy. It's very very weird to require you stay in the hospital. Either you can't control your eating habits or just refuse to do so. Based on the comments it's the second. Putting the life of your child at risk. YTA for that alone. Not listening is a poor excuse to growing a human being. They only get one chance to be in the womb and it's so irresponsible to be selfish to have a treat that carb dumps your baby. Let alone going out to eat breaks so many consistencies that the hospital is trying to make for the life of the child.", "Weird is right\u2026.", "Exactly. Sometimes doctors do advise bed rest for various reasons but it's at home, not in hospital. I am not sure what condition could lead to hospitalization plus also where you can roam around or sound normal (not very sick). \n\nAnd I'm in India.", "Hospital won't stop you from sharing food unofficially.

Op did the right thing by saying, husband, this isn't cool anymore", "Idk where op is. Tbh I'm pregnant and the whole combo sounded too juvenile to me to be real. But In Spain (at least in the north) they don't really police you around and some hospitals have gardens outside so it's easy to sneak in and out if you're not really too sick to walk away.\nWhat they absolutely wouldn't do/couldn't do  there is change her the room at her whim. Healthcare is public so it's also crowded, they don't have empty rooms sitting around ready to accommodate people quarreling", "I would just add though that it sounds like you were hospitalised for more than just GD, in my experience it's very rare to be hospitalised just for GD in the UK.", "I had GD and I still don\u2019t get t why she\u2019s hospitalized. It\u2019s actually pretty easy to navigate, and once you adjust your diet it should regulate.

I don't live in the US.My sister was hospitalised for monitoring during her pregnancy due to gestational diabetes as well. I don't know if its the norm or just for really high risk cases but we have \"free\" public healthcare so it was just a bit of an annoyance for my sister that she could not rest at home.

I did end up spending time in hospital due to pregnancy complications, but nothing to do with diabetes. As most have said, if you're sick enough to be in hospital for diabetes, you won't be going out or eating whatever you want.", "I honestly don't know what OP was for, but I can say what I have seen. One of the women that were with me had uncontrolled GD. Her levels were all over the place and tbh she wasn't following any diet. The doctors were trying normalize the levels and keep an eye on the baby and make her understand that she HAS to follow her dietary requirements. So I guess every case is different.", "Australian here, yes the government pays for all hospital stays and things like GD can be a hospitalisation for many reasons including other underlying factors to the mother.

However, I refused to go to the hospital I delivered at. I had cramps so bad that I felt like I was in labor. I was soaking through pads. They took my back to do an ultrasound and the tech ran out to get the doctor. He came in, looked at the screen, looked at me and he literally turned white. The ob left part of the placenta behind. They had me in \"emergency surgery\" within 20 minutes. The doctor also told my husband that he took me the ER just in time because I was about 30 minutes from bleeding out and dying. Countless nurses completely ignored me. My ob dismissed everything I told him. I delivered in a small private hospital; a \"top rated hospital\" and almost died. But the super busy, under funded, community hospital, is the hospital that listened to me and saved my life. I'm usually not one to jump to race, but I can say in this case, race played a big part.
