I have been hospitalized because I got gestational diabetes. I shared a room with another women Gina, who also has gestational diabetes. \n\nWe started talking after vistor hours were over and I found out she is going to be a solo parent. I felt sorry for Gina, because no one came up to vist her and it does get lonely in here. Expecially at night. \n\nSo every time someone came to vist me, I made a point to introduce Ginw and include her in any conversation, I would have with my vistors and share food with her. Because let's face it! Hospital food is terrible! I wouldn't wish it on my worse enemy.\n\nSo to the main part off the situation. My husband always vists me after work and I did introduce them. He sometimes takes me out to eat on the weekends. I asked if it was okay with him, if I could invite Gina and he said he didn't mind. It was then I noticed, Gina started asking him to do simple things like help her put her coat on and helping her tie her shoes and asking him to help her off her bed or up get up out of a chair. (She had no problem doing theses thing's by herself before) \n\nThen when I had a sore back my husband gave me a massage. Gina also asked him for a massage. But he declined. She went quite and ignored us for the rest of the vist. After when he left, I apologized to her but said it was inappropriate that she asked that from him. Gina started crying and saying she sore to and why can't she have a massage and it's not fair. I said you made my husband very uncomfortable and to please not do that again! Gina just flared up and started calling me nasty names and screaming, I was insecure and the nurses came in and they had to calm her down. I absolutely refused to go back into the same room as her that night and I was put in another room. \n\nNext morning my husband came and I told him what happened. I told him not to help Gina anymore. He was shocked at her behavior and agreed. He took me out for a walk and on our way down we saw Gina and she asked my husband for help to get up and he politely declined and we walked away. When we came back to my ward, I went to get me a drink and saw Gina by herself in the corner crying. Now I'm feeling bad and wondering if AITA?", "created_utc": 1702178479, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18eucf3/aita_for_not_letting_my_husband_help_another/", "score": 172, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Look after yourself.", "NTA.\n\nWhat Gina asked was inappropriate and so was her response.  She has some issues beyond being alone while pregnant.\n\nYou chose your best bet and that was to go NC with her.  You are not her medical team nor her therapists or support system.  You were nice and she wanted more.  No bueno.", "NTA. She was inappropriate and you responded in a way that protected yourself and your marriage. She has only herself to blame. I feel for her situation, but she was hitting on your husband.", "Nta you were right to stop him helping her because clearly she is going through something and isn\u2019t being rational. Your husband gets to say no. The fact she wanted to disregard him being uncomfortable means that the relationship is not okay and he shouldn\u2019t continue to help. It would do more damage for her in the long run because it sounds like she got her wires crossed. Maybe she started fantasizing that you were all in this together or that he was her partner. Once he said no and once you explained he was uncomfortable she should have dropped it.", "NTA. Grabbing a snack is one thing. Asking the spouse of another patient to treat you the same as their wife? Not in the least appropriate.

You can feel sorry for her but you've already helped her a bunch. She just started taking advantage of your kindness.", "NTA. Inviting her into your life would be a terrible mistake.

Ive been pregnant and I\u2019m surprised they had you share a room I didn\u2019t know hospitals still did that. But I\u2019m glad they moved you. Hope you have a safe and awesome pregnancy/birth.

Birthing alone is not for the faint of heart. However I learned at a very young age from my single mom - you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re capable of until you don\u2019t have a choice - and that\u2019s where Gina is at. I\u2019d prob give her a nice chat and reassure her bc that\u2019s just my personality and I always cheer for the under dog. But absolutely no damn way some woman will ask my husband for a massage and not hear it from me DIRECTLY and with a bit of attitude  behind the words.

I wouldn't wish it on my worse enemy.\n\nHad a baby last year, have to disagree with you on this. I genuinely enjoyed the meals knowing when I got out I wouldn\u2019t be able to have meals like that for some time. They served several dishes, like for breakfast you got cereal, milk, tea or coffee, fresh fruit, yogurt, eggs, French toast. I knew I wouldn\u2019t have time to prepare meals like that with a newborn.

I agree that asking your husband was wrong.", "Here I go against the grain again, but ESH.\n\nThere's no question that she shouldn't have called you nasty names.\n\nFor your part, consider that your husband, being a grown man who knows how to use his word,  handled her requests just fine.  He said yes to requests he deemed reasonable (e.g. shoes) and no to the ones he deemed unreasonable (massage).  Could you explain why you felt the need to have an extra conversation with her when he clearly didn't need your help?", "Yeah NTA - it seems like there\u2019s a reason why Gina is alone", "If this is real, they are not in the states, hospitals don't let you come and go, bed rest is bed rest and no DR in the states is letting you sign out AMA and the doing readmission paperwork just to go watch your husband eat", "I was recently hospitalized for diabetic ketoacidosis.   I dunno what happened to her but its bad if shes inpatient.  Youre right She definitely should not be eating extra food right now.  They need to get it under control.

I am on a strict diet. He takes me out to eat, but I can't eat what he has. So he basically buys me what I'm required to eat. I definitely can go out with my husband. We even asked the nurses. I am hospitalized, because I didn't listen to my midwife when they first put on the diet, it caused complications and I landed in here. Yes are not suppose to share with other patients, but she was on the same dietary requirements as me, so I saw no harm.", "Yeah I live next to a world wide hub in the medical community, aka one of the best heathcare systems in the world. No one I know gets this kind of treatment for gestational diabetes.", "She is obviously not in the states. In my country if you are hospitalised for a long period of time, you have specific hours during which you can leave the hospital (tbh, we would leave any time when there were no doctors around, nobody really cared. There were even some women that would \"sneak out\" and spend the night in their own homes). There were two women there with gestational diabetes, just for monitoring, because they weren't following their diet (similar to what OP said in her comments). So for me this post seems genuine, different countries do things differently. And with that, NTA.", "It\u2019s not weird, it\u2019s fake.
