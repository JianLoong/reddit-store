She can show her face when she's ready to apologize for her abhorrent behaviour.", "NTA.  Lucy wasn't \"kidding around\" on their husband's lap, so your friends are wrong saying you were too harsh.  You tolerated her antics until she crossed a huge line.  It had to be so embarrassing to your husband to have this girl continuing to flirt with him.  Hopefully the antics at work have stopped now too so he won't have to speak to HR.  \nInstead of crying in her car and avoiding you, she should have apologized to you and your husband.  She deserves no pity just because she cried.", "Solidly NTA in my opinion; as soon as he voiced discomfort, she should have stopped. She DEFINITELY didn\u2019t need to escalate it the way she did - sitting in his lap and getting offended when he immediately shoved her off? That girl needs a reality check. Your husband clearly isn\u2019t interested and doesn\u2019t want her attention. And, honestly OP, you were a lot nicer about it than I would have been if it had been my significant other or even a friend\u2019s SO. \n\nHow does she act towards him at work? Is her inappropriate behaviour only an \u201cafter hours\u201d thing? Or does she also act similarly at work? Because, either way : a conversation needs to happen between your husband and his HR as well as your mutual friend and you two. \n\nIf her presence makes you or your husband uncomfortable and makes the gatherings no longer enjoyable, then there should be separate group outings - your friends should understand and it\u2019s honestly not hard to rotate outings between you and your husband one time and this \u201cacquaintance\u201d.  This will help with keeping some much needed distance between you two and her. Maybe also have the mutual friend have a talk with her about respecting boundaries. \n\nIf they\u2019re true friends, they\u2019d understand. She also needs to grow up and act like the adult she\u2019s supposed to be. Honestly, you\u2019re probably not wrong about why she got divorced. My only question is : is your husband a higher level than her at work? Because that might actually explain some things - like her insistence. \n\nBut, all in all : NTA , OP", "NTA.  \nAnd I'll be blunt, this could get real messy for your husband and YOU.  \nYou husband has literally said \"No\".  \nAnd your friend needs to tell their friend to back off and get help.  \nMarriages don't break down for nothing.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nIt's a clear case of sexual harassment and your husband needs to go to HR yesterday.
