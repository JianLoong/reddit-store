You tolerated her antics until she crossed a huge line.  It had to be so embarrassing to your husband to have this girl continuing to flirt with him.  Hopefully the antics at work have stopped now too so he won't have to speak to HR.  \nInstead of crying in her car and avoiding you, she should have apologized to you and your husband.  She deserves no pity just because she cried.", "Solidly NTA in my opinion; as soon as he voiced discomfort, she should have stopped. She DEFINITELY didn\u2019t need to escalate it the way she did - sitting in his lap and getting offended when he immediately shoved her off? That girl needs a reality check. Your husband clearly isn\u2019t interested and doesn\u2019t want her attention. And, honestly OP, you were a lot nicer about it than I would have been if it had been my significant other or even a friend\u2019s SO. \n\nHow does she act towards him at work? Is her inappropriate behaviour only an \u201cafter hours\u201d thing? Or does she also act similarly at work? Because, either way : a conversation needs to happen between your husband and his HR as well as your mutual friend and you two. \n\nIf her presence makes you or your husband uncomfortable and makes the gatherings no longer enjoyable, then there should be separate group outings - your friends should understand and it\u2019s honestly not hard to rotate outings between you and your husband one time and this \u201cacquaintance\u201d.  This will help with keeping some much needed distance between you two and her. Maybe also have the mutual friend have a talk with her about respecting boundaries. \n\nIf they\u2019re true friends, they\u2019d understand. She also needs to grow up and act like the adult she\u2019s supposed to be. Honestly, you\u2019re probably not wrong about why she got divorced. My only question is : is your husband a higher level than her at work?

The response is to make records of what was said when to establish boundaries, and what she said and did and when to cross them. \"Stop flirting with me\" \"Don't touch me without my permission\" \"This isn't funny, it makes me very uncomfortable.\" \"If you continue doing X, I will have to bring it to Ys attention.\" Or same for you... \"If you do X, you will no longer be welcome/invited\"", "ESH.\n\nShe sucks for her behavior, you suck for attacking her like that.", "Schrodinger's Joke: it either is or isn't a joke, entirely dependant on the reaction of the people around you.", "Agreed. Definitely NTA. My first thought was \"BOUNDARIES BIYATCH\".\n\nEveryone has boundaries. It's clear that she's been messing with his making him uncomfortable. It's a good thing that OP threw the gauntlet down, calling her out on her BS in a clear and unmistakable manner that left no room for misinterpretation. Especially if it's been an ongoing issue.\n\nOP should definitely follow up with any other mutual friends who weren't directly there so they don't get some messed up out of context version of the events that happened.\n\nHe needs to be sure to reinforce and support OP's stance, as well as cover his butt at work in case she decides to somehow get revenge through HR or something.", "I hate the \u201ccan\u2019t you take a joke?!\u201d excuse for being an asshole.", "NTA. And honestly that wasn\u2019t even harsh imo. If Lucy sat on my man\u2019s lap I would\u2019ve made sure she stayed long enough for me to watch her cry\ud83d\ude08", "Glad to see this comment. OP was pushed to the point of snapping so harsh but NTA. But a lot of people are making assumptions about Lucy\u2019s divorce, suggesting that OP was \u201cright\u201d about why Lucy got divorced with literally zero information about what actually happened. There\u2019s lots of reasons it might have happened like infidelity (on either side), losing a baby or even DV. \n\nThere\u2019s no potential reason that gives her an excuse to sexually harass OP\u2019s husband or mean that OP wasn\u2019t justified in being harsh, but there\u2019s plenty to judge Lucy on with the information we have without jumping to conclusions about her marriage.", "This happened with my husband. He tried to report her to HR but turns out she went first. Her story was then taken over his despite him having witnesses.", "NTA, please make sure that he gives a detailed history to HR that includes the several attempts he made for her to stop it and that he makes it clear that her sitting in his lap was a step way too far.", "Steal the husband might not even be accurate. This is premature psychotic shit (showing up at the house).", "100% agree.\n\nThe people saying she was just joking around and you were being too harsh are both idiots and enablers.\n\nShe was sexually harassing your husband. He\u2019s repeatedly told her to stop and has said it makes him uncomfortable. If it was a guy who pulled a girl down on his lap and made that type of comment they\u2019d of been all over him (and I know how tiring the \u2018of the genders were reversed\u2019 thing gets but it\u2019s really applicable here).\n\nNTA- this isn\u2019t about you being jealous or catty or whatever. This was you protecting your spouse from someone making inappropriate, unwanted advances to them. She had no right to touch him and the second he voiced he was uncomfortable she should have backed off. \n\nYou\u2019re never in the wrong for protecting a loved one. Your husband have repeatedly told her no and to stop. She kept escalating it. Saying \u2018it\u2019s just a joke and \u2018I\u2019m just playing around\u2019 is not a cover it\u2019s the same excuse every creep, sleaze and mouth breather makes when they\u2019re called out for their inappropriate actions.\n\nNTA - he should go to HR and any so-called friends who give you grief or drop you for standing up to someone sexually harassing your loved one isn\u2019t any kind of friend and is just a really crappy person in general.", "My first job out of college I was 22 and worked with this 30ish year old single mom. She offered to basically be my sugar baby and I declined in a pretty mean way. She immediately reported me to HR for making advances on her. Luckily she mentioned it in a Gmail chat so I had proof.", "They don't have a man anymore.", "Anyone Lucy tells is going to think op is the asshole when Lucy leaves the part about sitting on his lap", "I would say get the husband to go to HR as soon as possible, seeing as there is both a chance she might try something herself and this harassment turned into assault, literally touching another person in a sexual manner without their consent.", "EXACTLY!!!", "Don\u2019t kink shame", "Thank fuck someone said this.\n\nLucy was way out of line but that doesn't mean OP should rip her heart out in front of her friends and co-workers.\n\nI also very much doubt that husband has been clear and upfront with Lucy but that's a whole other thing.", "They tried to address that multiple times, which it says in the post. Lucy doesn\u2019t care and has seemingly only escalated. Mature conversations only work with mature people.", ">But tbh, you have no idea what happened to her marriage do you?\n\nDo you? Because I certainly do not.\n\nSounds like you are making up a scenario... He could have been an abuser, or she could have been a cheater who got caught and got divorced as a result.\n\nThe thing is, nobody knows, so why not stick to what we do know in OP's case?", "I understand OP\u2019s husband\u2019s apprehension. It probably isn\u2019t just because Lucy is a single mom. No one wants to report anything to HR. It is a great way to helge labeled a \u201ctroublemaker.\u201d HR isn\u2019t there to help employees at the end of the day. HR exists to forward the interests of the business. \n\nUnfortunately, you really need to report these incidents early to create a paper trail.", "Seriously, this is just unhinged behavior. She is not only continuously sexually harassing the guy, she is doing it openly in front of his wife and friends.", "More likely that line really cut deep. I've known a few girls like Lucy. The ones who are shameless would just counter with another line.", "OP and husband should probably leave any outside social situation in which she attends. If they arrive and she is there? Leave. If they have been there for a bit and she arrives? Leave. It sucks that you can\u2019t socialize but it 1) protects SO from accusations 2) makes sure she can\u2019t do anything to the two of you and 3) sends a clear message to her that neither of you want anything to do with her.", "Work politics is the worst, you can't even avoid it because if you do you become the easy target because the other staff think you won't fight back or cause waves.", "Agreed, but some people have issues with seeing women in that light. It is sexual harassment either way, some HR departments don't believe it because women are automatically the victims no matter what. But if OP went to HR and said that if the situation were reversed they would view it 100% differently, may make them see how bad it is if they don't already.", "Speaking as a male SA survivor, yes, we can be SA\u2019d", ">John has turned her down, and has also **explicitly told her that she was making him feel uncomfortable and to stop.**\n\nHow much more clear can you get.", "Story time \ud83e\udd7a", "A company would never do something illegal/immoral and then not get in trouble. This has literally never happened.", "It's never bad advice to update your resume.", "The moment he told her he was uncomfortable, and asked her to stop, was the same moment it became an HR issue. Also it's a big no no if she only has his number for work related purposes and she is texting him for non work related things outside of business hours, especially after he said he was uncomfortable. Filing a report is a CYA thing, so there's a record, she has crossed boundaries, but it doesn't seem she has done anything that could get her fired YET. Now she has been humiliated, big blows to your ego can make you do spiteful shit. She had some serious audacity to sit on another woman's husbands lap.", "Reverse genders in the story, see how you feel about it then.\n\n> He also works with my wife \"Jane\", and I guess because we also see him outside of work, he thinks he's super close to my wife.

It looks like the two got fired for more than John binning the wallet -  probably a bit of hide the sausage on company time - but either way none of it is the fault of Miss wallet owner.
