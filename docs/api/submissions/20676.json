Lucy is lucky that she just felt your wrath rather than your husband going to HR *like he should.*\n\nI understand completely why your husband doesn't want to. There are probably two reasons. 1) He really doesn't want her to get in trouble and 2) it's \"embarrassing\" for a man to say they are being sexually harassed. \n\nYou should probably tell your husband that he needs to go to HR about it. She shouldn't lose her job over one instance and she'll hopefully learn a very valuable lesson. Sexual harassment in the workplace isn't a game.", "NTA she was TOLD it made him uncomfortable.

Whether it\u2019s due to her feeling insecure because of a divorce, or unrequited feelings towards your husband, none of Lucy\u2019s behavior is okay. Your husband has told her that he\u2019s not okay with her behavior. If this was a guy doing it to a girl, the shouts of sexual harassment would be far and wide.

She is literally sexually harassing your husband; the two of you would only be T A to yourselves for NOT contacting HR about this.\n\nHer behavior is absolutely inexcusable.

You've been nice, your husband has been nice- she isn't respecting your marriage or any boundaries. She deserved it.
