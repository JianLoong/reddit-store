She can show her face when she's ready to apologize for her abhorrent behaviour.", "NTA.  Lucy wasn't \"kidding around\" on their husband's lap, so your friends are wrong saying you were too harsh.  You tolerated her antics until she crossed a huge line.  It had to be so embarrassing to your husband to have this girl continuing to flirt with him.  Hopefully the antics at work have stopped now too so he won't have to speak to HR.  \nInstead of crying in her car and avoiding you, she should have apologized to you and your husband.  She deserves no pity just because she cried.", "Solidly NTA in my opinion; as soon as he voiced discomfort, she should have stopped. She DEFINITELY didn\u2019t need to escalate it the way she did - sitting in his lap and getting offended when he immediately shoved her off? That girl needs a reality check. Your husband clearly isn\u2019t interested and doesn\u2019t want her attention. And, honestly OP, you were a lot nicer about it than I would have been if it had been my significant other or even a friend\u2019s SO. \n\nHow does she act towards him at work? Is her inappropriate behaviour only an \u201cafter hours\u201d thing? Or does she also act similarly at work? Because, either way : a conversation needs to happen between your husband and his HR as well as your mutual friend and you two. \n\nIf her presence makes you or your husband uncomfortable and makes the gatherings no longer enjoyable, then there should be separate group outings - your friends should understand and it\u2019s honestly not hard to rotate outings between you and your husband one time and this \u201cacquaintance\u201d.  This will help with keeping some much needed distance between you two and her. Maybe also have the mutual friend have a talk with her about respecting boundaries. \n\nIf they\u2019re true friends, they\u2019d understand. She also needs to grow up and act like the adult she\u2019s supposed to be. Honestly, you\u2019re probably not wrong about why she got divorced. My only question is : is your husband a higher level than her at work? Because that might actually explain some things - like her insistence. \n\nBut, all in all : NTA , OP", "NTA.  \nAnd I'll be blunt, this could get real messy for your husband and YOU.  \nYou husband has literally said \"No\".  \nAnd your friend needs to tell their friend to back off and get help.  \nMarriages don't break down for nothing.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nIt's a clear case of sexual harassment and your husband needs to go to HR yesterday.

He was hesitant to believe it, but she was patient, and persistent. I was visiting him at work when I saw something that set of my internal alarm. We had a difficult conversation that night. My husband was terrible with confrontation, and he thought he could just ignore her until she'd stop. I tried explaining some warning signs, but he didn't think she was as interested as I said.\n\nWe finished our conversation, and within 30 minutes, he gets a long message from her. He handed me his phone so I could read it, and all he said was \"you were right.\" She was proclaiming how she's loved him the whole time, but she knows he'll never be hers. She mentioned she would have loved him even if he became disabled or disfigured. \n\nAll I could think of was people that had thrown ACID in the faces of those that rejected them!\n\nI asked how I could best support him moving forward.

Tbh I never thought a man could be SA'd but I've read scenarios where men were put in these situations and its very frustrating when the main reason they arent taken seriously is because the women in these scenarios used their gender against them and threatened to accuse them of SA.if a woman is capable of murdering, cheating etc, they're capable of doing that same act.", "sounds like that friend is really only lucy\u2019s friend, and i think lucy should keep them. nta.", "Maybe, but be honest if you and your partner had already tried many times to do so politely (both at work and social gatherings) and she had dropped a comment like that, it would be quite justified to say something in the heat of the moment after feelings build up and especially putting the husband on blast like that.", "Can confirm. My (F) best friend (\"Jenny\" /F) worked in the same place, but way different departments.

When I went back in the next day, it was gone. I searched high and low, and finally asked everyone to keep an eye out.\n\nJenny randomly ghosted me one day. She fell off the radar at work, just gone. At the same time all of John's shifts became available, and the most senior person on the team started giving me the cold shoulder.\n\nTurns out, Jenny talked John into throwing away my wallet, on video.
