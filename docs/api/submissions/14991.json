I'm (44) a single dad to two kids \"Audrey\" (16) and \"Emily\" (12). We have a great relationship but Audrey can sometimes be rude and demeaning, saying cruel things casually when she's displeased about something or in a bad mood. Emily (her little sister) looks up to her, often mimicking her behavior which obviously worries me.\n\nI cooked a nice Sunday dinner and Audrey stormed downstairs in a bad mood for who knows what reason. She was being a downer whereas Emily and I were cheerful. I asked her to improve her mood please instead of ruining the dinner, she turned to me and unleashed her anger. To quote some of her elegant words: \"can you stop lecturing for once, you're annoying as f\\*ck and seriously you're the one who ruins everything\".\n\nI stood up, took her plate, and dumped it in the trashcan. I told her since she can't bother to show me any basic respect, she should start providing for herself from now on. She said she'll make cereal and maybe I was an AH, I said no that's my milk and she should get a job to get her own groceries. I don't feel like i yelled at her, I felt I spoke calmly but when she realized I was being serious, she got upset and started crying and ran to her room.\n\nWe haven't talked since. Obviously she's mad at me but now my younger daughter is mad at me too, saying I acted like a huge jerk to her sister. I of course don't see it that way, I don't tolerate being spoken to with such disrespect and it did hurt me a lot hearing Audrey say these things to me that were uncalled for.\n\nSo was I the asshole? Obviously not winning any \"dad of the year\" award but will I be winning any \"AH of the year\" award?\n\nedit: forgot to include that my daughter also made a snide comment about the food not looking good, which was what triggered me to throw her plate away\n\nedit 2: I did ask her, twice, at the beginning what was wrong and why she was in such a bad mood. Her response was a sarcastic \"you wouldn't get it\". I asked why not, she just sighed\n\nedit 3: of course i'm not going to starve her. I was just trying to make a point to her.\n\nedit 4: vast majority of you think I'm the AH. I'll apologize and give her her cereal.", "created_utc": 1681698597, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12oylc2/aita_for_dumping_my_teenage_daughters_dinner_in/", "score": 1736, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No. But she\u2019s probably going through something and could use some grace.

Or, tell her to go make herself something else. \n\nEdit 2: You're dad, she's a teen girl.  There will be many things you really WON'T get, or that she doesn't feel comfortable talking about.  Please make sure she has an older female she can confide in, or a therapist. \n\nEdit 3: what point was that, exactly?  That you're willing to cut her off on a dime, when she displeases you?

Withholding food as punishment is never a good idea and it will get you absolutely nowhere with your kid.", "So she clearly has a history of being overwhelmed and ran by her emotions... and instead of modeling behavior for her, you let her emotions overwhelm you as well, which lead to *your* emotions overwhelming you and it leading to a disaster of a situation with every member of the household being overwhelmed.\n\nSo... yeah YTA.

Maybe you\u2019re making her feel unheard, or uncared for - children usually lash out because they don\u2019t know how to deal with their anger. I suggest you have a talk, maybe family therapy. I also suggest you don\u2019t starve your daughter and make her feel like a burden when she\u2019s obviously in a contentious place - not cool to have a child and then expect them to provide for themselves just because you feel like/they are being a dick.

Sure, teenagers can be little shits, and power struggles suck, but you should NEVER deprive them of any basic need - food, shelter, clothing, etc as a punishment.

You failed your kid in so many ways.", "YTA\n\nYou should find some parenting classes. Taking away your child\u2019s meal has no benefits and teaches 0 lessons other than that adults also throw temper tantrums. Not the message you want to give.

YTA again.", "YTA Why didn\u2019t you ask her what was wrong?", "YTA\n\nDon't use food as punishment.

Yelling at her did not get your point across either, it made you look like the one who was lacking self control as bad as her.\n\nLead by example, be firm, but do not lose your temper. You have to make it right by her and admit what you just did was wrong, teaching her its okay to admit when you messed up.", "YTA\n\nBeing a single dad isn't an excuse for being a shitty parent.

Look, being a single dad can be hard, but communication is key and it doesn't feel like there's any here.\n\n\nShe's a teenager going through puberty.

All of us have not so perfect moments as parents, and this is one of them, but it doesn't make you TA.  The few times my kids acted like this, I sent them to their room and told them to come back when they could have a mature conversation. We then have a conversation about their words. I would ask Audrey why she feels you deserve to be talked to that way and how she would feel to be called annoying as f*ck.  My kids very rarely give me an attitude as they dont want to have the hours long conversation with me about their actions, feelings, etc... I bore them into good behavior.  Audrey's old enough to understand the weight of her words and that they potentially have consequences. You had a lapse in parenting judgment, you'll do better next time!", "YTA.

Why should she respect yours?\n\nYou need to teach her how to grapple with her feelings and manage her moods and emotions.

So, she can't eat bc she's being a turd?", "For the future, here are some alternative things to say rather than asking her to fix her attitude.

Food is not a given, but something that can be taken away at every minute. And you will not provide for her and are really unsafe to be around. My mother took my food away when I was a child. And this made me eat everything as fast as I could no matter if I was hungry. Who knew when the food would be taken away? I needed to eat it before this happened. To this day I have an unhealthy relationship to food. I am a really fat woman. I have no controll and I have no idea how to decide when I get full. \n\nPlease don't do this.\n\nThe main problem is that you try to force your daughter to regulate her feelings when you never tought her how to do this. I am not surprised. You don't know how to do it yourself. You were hurt by what she said and you did react without considering her side. You are the adult. You need to stay calm and take the punches without leashing out.\n\nSomething you can try next time: \"I see that you are in a bad mood. You are allowed to be in a bad mood, but you are not allowed to take it out on me. You can either eat your food in silence or you can go to your room until you calmed down while your food waits here for you, but I don't want to be spoken to like this.\"\n\nAnd then let her choose. When she calmed down you can talk to her how she made you feel. That it is hurtful if she says this things about the food as it is expensive to buy and you put work into it. Let her work on solutions for this situation if she feels like this again. She is mad. Is she mad at you? Than she should tell you. Is she not mad at you? She can talk about her feelings if she wants to, or she can write them down or she can spend some time alone. But she cannot be disrespectful to you. She will need to find a better way to deal with this.\n\nIt is a lot of work, but on the long run she will learn how to work through her emotions on her own.", "ESH.

This kind of behavior is why I don't talk to my parents. You're exhausting. She's 16, she's hormonal, and she thinks she's the only person who feels the way she does.

I'm (44) a single dad to two kids \"Audrey\" (16) and \"Emily\" (12). We have a great relationship but Audrey can sometimes be rude and demeaning, saying cruel things casually when she's displeased about something or in a bad mood. Emily (her little sister) looks up to her, often mimicking her behavior which obviously worries me.\n\nI cooked a nice Sunday dinner and Audrey stormed downstairs in a bad mood for who knows what reason. She was being a downer whereas Emily and I were cheerful. I asked her to improve her mood please instead of ruining the dinner, she turned to me and unleashed her anger. To quote some of her elegant words: \"can you stop lecturing for once, you're annoying as f\\*ck and seriously you're the one who ruins everything\".\n\nI stood up, took her plate, and dumped it in the trashcan. I told her since she can't bother to show me any basic respect, she should start providing for herself from now on. She said she'll make cereal and maybe I was an AH, I said no that's my milk and she should get a job to get her own groceries. I don't feel like i yelled at her, I felt I spoke calmly but when she realized I was being serious, she got upset and started crying and ran to her room.\n\nWe haven't talked since. Obviously she's mad at me but now my younger daughter is mad at me too, saying I acted like a huge jerk to her sister. I of course don't see it that way, I don't tolerate being spoken to with such disrespect and it did hurt me a lot hearing Audrey say these things to me that were uncalled for.\n\nSo was I the asshole? Obviously not winning any \"dad of the year\" award but will I be winning any \"AH of the year\" award?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Good Luck", "Parenting is hard, and sometimes, we lose it. I get that 100%. My son is 14, and he has been going through it lately, and guess who eats 99% of his shit? Me. Have I always acted with grace and patience? No, I have not, I am human, I also have pride, and my ego is sometimes wounded by what he says or does, and I have limits. I have lost it, I have yelled when I shouldn't, and I have said things that were also not kind that I regretted.\n\nWhen this happens, I take 5 minutes and get myself in order, I give him time to cool off also, and I start a conversation with an apology, let him decide if he accepts it or not and if he wants to talk about it or not. Usually, he accepts, and we have a chat. Just because I am an adult doesn't make me always in the right. Kids unload on where their unconditional love is, unfortunately. \n\nTaking away food is not the route I would go. You need to clear that up with her. Teenagers are hormonal nightmares on top of the insanity they are living through at the moment. Take a moment and think about all the shit that has been bombarded on them in the past few years, we think it doesn't affect them as much, but it does. They have learned about environmental crisis and how damaged the world and environment are. The political climate is always discussed, and it is hard for us to deal with and understand. It is even scarier for them. Covid happened to them, too, and one day, they were just all sent back to school, with few resources to help them cope. They deal with a lot, and we just don't see it as that serious because they are kids. \n\nTelling someone to be happy when they aren't usually has the opposite effect. Does that mean she gets to speak to you any way she pleases? No, it doesn't. You could have asked her if she would like to eat alone or have something else since she is not feeling great. It was your ego that was hurt by her remarks about your food. It was you that was upset that your plans of a nice dinner were not going how you wanted it to because she wasn't playing the part you wanted her to. Those were your expectations that got crushed, and it led you to react how you did to her disrespect.\n\nSo, be the adult, and talk to her. Do not expect her to accept your apology. That is up to her. Set up some reasonable ground rules of how you wish to be treated and what behaviors are unacceptable(for example, I let my son swear, in conversation but swearing at me is unacceptable, he can say this fucking sucks, but not you fucking suck), and what the consequences will be in the future. Also, her sister may look up to her, but it is not her responsibility to be a role model. It is amazing if she wants to be, but it isn't her job. Let her know you are there for her, and as hard as it is for her to imagine, you were her age at one point, and you understand and remember what it was like, and that she can talk to you. Try to just listen, I like to say, \"Is this venting, or do you want some problem solving help?\" She may just need to be heard sometimes. Also, be open with your feelings. You are human, and sometimes they forget that, like telling her what she said hurt your feelings, and that is why you reacted out of anger and wounded pride, but that isn't acceptable, that is not how to treat people you love and care for and you will work on that because you do not want her to think that is ok. You are the man in her life at the moment, and she is learning from you what is acceptable treatment for the future. Remember that.\n\nLook up resources and seek counseling if you can, for all of you.

No. For trust issues, food scarcity mindset, and therefore boosting her chances for developing disordered eating, which she is already at great risk for, verbal and emotional abuse committed by a \u201cparent\u201d, and impending LC or NC when she grows up.\nNah, you can rest your little head, and have your happy-go-lucky toxic positivity fueled dreams, sponsored by the cult of parents that refuse to work in themselves yet expect their kids to be better, despite not having role models to copy.\nSpeaking of role models, I came up with a nickname for you.\nSleep tight, and sweet dreams cheese puff.\nYTA, in case you are actually too dense to realize that at this point - which I have real concern for.\nGet therapy.", "\u201cI\u2019ll apologize and give her her cereal\u201d.

My man. This girl is 16. She is a child.

Like damn, some adult you are if you can't provide for your daughter just because you're too thin skinned and delicate to handle a bit of moodiness from a literal teenager. \n\nI'm getting the vibe that you resent being a parent. Like I'll be honest, my first impression was that you're probably handling this situation like you're also a teenager because you had kids too young  and never had a change to emotionally devolp past that mentality. But 44 (your age) - 16 (age of daughter) - 1 (plus about a year for pregnancy, rounded up) = 27. For a lot of people that's still too young, but like. For the math I was expecting to work, you'd have to be 34 right now.\n\nI don't mean to rag on you too much, daddy-o. Single fatherhood's got to be hard. That said, I think you really should consider taking better care of yourself. Maybe try therapy and/or a career change? Take a vacation? Day spay? Change in diet in exercise regimen? Assuming you can afford any of those things - money is fucking tough sometimes. My point is that the way you seem to treat your daughter in this post really makes is seem like you're having trouble extending empathy to her because you're too wrapped up in yourself, possibly because you're not very content or cared for. \n\nUnfortunately your daughters aren't people who can take care of you right now. If you do good by them, they'll probably take care of you when they're both real adults and your body starts failing, but right now unfortunately you have to take care of yourself. So, my advice: Apologize to your damn daughter, make sure she has something to eat, and after that sit down and take a good think on what you want out of life that you can get, or at least get closer to. Like, I want 5 million dollars and a perfect body, but neither of those are ever going to happen for me. However, in the past few years I've lost about 20 pounds and saved up a couple thousand dollars, you know? It ain't much, but just that I've made progress on it makes me a lot happier and able to extend kindness to others.\n\nBut back to your daughter - She really needs her daddy right now. Like, being 16 fucking sucks regardless of you're gender, but also consider that \\*you\\* probably \\*wouldn't\\* understand some of the problems a 16 year old girl might face. That's not your fault, you're a dude, you know? But getting all pissy at your daughter and withholding food from her really kind of confirms and drives home that not only would you not understand whatever problem she's facing, but that you really have no interest in trying to understand either. Really did not make yourself someone she can rely on with your behavior at all. In the very least, if you can't make her life easier, try not to make it worse. I think you'll find that if you stick to doing that for a few months, your daughter will start repaying the favor.\n\nGood luck.", "YTA.", "YTA. Your behavior is sickening towards your child.

I can tell you for sure, I wasn't talking about any of that stuff with my family and definitely not my dad. And them saying \"are you mad?\" Or \"cheer up, you're ruing xyz\" was a cheat code to an angry teenage girl, on top of whatever else was happening in my head. She's gonna have lots of big feelings, and that's healthy. Forcing only positive feelings, especially in her own home, which SHOULD be a safe space, is NOT healthy.

Bonus, you're modeling that you don't have to let someone else's words hurt you. Also, saying mean things to get a reaction doesn't work.\n\nWhat your punishments are teaching her is not \"use nice words\", it's \"those emotions are bad.\" Focus on how to recognize and manage those emotions.

Two, this is where gentle/responsive parenting may be helpful because it\u2019s about creating the sense of choice and autonomy in the constricts of the lack of autonomy (no candy for dinner, but she can have a piece alongside dinner or here are her options in Roblox etc). A big thing with kids to remember is that they have very little sense of emotional regulation, and we as adults tend to try to hold them to adult standards that adults don\u2019t even do (your comment on everyone has a bad day including me but that doesn\u2019t mean we get to make people around us suffer as much as we are).

Important to remember that negative attention is always better than no attention, and sending her away can unintentionally reinforce that. Can you spend 5 minutes doing a check in on how her mood is before dinner? You tolerating her big feelings is a part of your job as parent, so witnessing them and honoring the feeling without the request is really important.

If she did, it still would not make her behavior okay, but it would make it understandable, just to be clear.\n\nImo, you are letting her misbehavior go on far too long. When she begins to complain or says something rude, calmly remind her that \"we do not speak rudely like that in this house. If you do it again, you will have to go to your room until you are ready to be polite.\"\n\n**And then you follow through.**\n\nHer behavior may escalate at first, but it should taper off quickly once she realizes that you are actually serious and there will be consequences for her actions and words.

Two suggestions for you. \n\nNumber one: in my house, the rule is either you eat what's for dinner, or you make your own (which includes cleaning up after yourself). My kids don't want what I've made? Then they can make themselves a PB&J, or a quesadilla, or whatever else is in their skill range.\n\nNumber two: if she complains about meals a lot, then consider having her help with meal planning and prep.\n\nHonestly, if your daughter isn't getting in trouble for similar behavior at school, then she's acting out because she's learned she can get away with it at home. If she can control herself at school, then she can do it at home.\n\nTo summarize: You need to set out clear rules and boundaries *before* bad behavior starts. Lay out what the consequences will be for either kid breaking the rules. If they break a minor rule, I typically give one reminder of the rule and consequences. If it was serious misbehavior, like hurting someone, then no reminders, straight to consequences. Stay calm and don't yell when enforcing rules and consequences, because some kids thrive off the negative attention. And then stick with the rules. Be firm and consistent.

School?  A job?  Success?  Failure?  And what is she going to do with her life?  She's SIXTEEN, and that ain't easy.  \n\nSo she's in a bad mood and what do you do?  Let her be while you and sis talk and laugh till she joins in - or not - and let her have her space?  No, you confront her, telling her to improve her mood b/c she's ruining dinner.  On what planet would that work with ANYone in a bad mood? \n\nHad she said, \"Well, dad, you seem to be disgruntled.  Improve your mood b/c you're ruining our dinner,\" would you have instantly turned into Mr. Happy?  \n\nThen you threw away her food, another AH move, and told her to fend for herself - only then you informed her that you own all the food and she can't have any unless she gets a job and buys her own food. \n\nClue for you: when you ask someone what is wrong and they don't tell you, shut up.  Quit asking.  Just say something noncommittal like, \"I wish I could make it better, whatever it is.\"  \n\nAnd don't be so sure you aren't already starving her.  Withholding food, withholding your support and understanding...\n\nYou need to apologize to her and forget the cereal.  Get her a pizza.  Adding a make-up box of her favorite chocolate candies (and one for little sis who feels caught in the middle) wouldn't be a bad idea either.", "Impossible. You own her.

Recognize they had had a bad day or something bad had happened and ask them what was wrong, what had happened, was there anything you could do to help. But no. You had to be an asshole.

That's called parenting.\n\nHe took away 1 meal, she derided it and was insanely rude.\n\nHe threatened much more than that, but everyone gets carried away in the heat of an intense confrontation.\n\nHe needs to do more to be there for his daughter outside of small talk while eating. But to claim he's like an abusive husband locking his wife away is insane", "One meal is not a basic necessity. I assume the threat of withholding more food was talking out of his ass. But one meal isn't a big deal. That's not how the human body works.", "Bold of you to assume anyone in Reddit has any kind of reading comprehension.", "Having boundaries is not the same thing as having conditional love. If your kid is being a little shit, you set boundaries, tell them off, send them to their room or whatever. You don't stop loving them, or make them feel like you will.", "Yup, it's like you're semi fine for a minute and then she gotta chime in with the \"get that sour look off your face\" and then gets counter mad that the thing she said makes you mad when YOU WERENT TO BEGIN WITH", "That actually worked on me but it came from a friend I worked with and he had had enough of my shit. Hearing it from him was surreal and made me take a step back and examine myself.\n\n\"Calm the fuck down.\" From a dear friend is all it takes.", "Came here to add this one. Nothing ratchets up a fight like being told to calm down.", "\u201cYour feelings are valid. I\u2019m sorry you are in a shit mood. But I worked hard on this dinner; hurting my feelings won\u2019t heal yours. If a plate or cereal in your room would better serve you tonight, okay. I deserve to be spoken to with respect regardless of your feelings. When you are ready to do that, come down. When you are ready to talk, if ever, I\u2019m ready to listen.\u201d", "My mom did the opposite, and it actually, really fucked me up.  If I was having a bad day as a kid, or if my parents were fighting (they fought at the table about twice a month), I would run to my room and hide.  \n\nInstead of letting me have that time, my mom would force me back to the table.  I never got why, especially when they were fighting, and she might be in tears (that happened a few times a year).  I didn't want to see that.  She made me sit there, almost like she wanted to pretend it wasn't upsetting to me.\n\nLetting a kid go to her room during a meltdown lets the kid decompress.  It is a solid move.  And if the kid is being an asshole, the kid is a kid and might not understand what the hell is going on in her own head.  \n\nI wish my parents let me have time to figure shit out.   Being forced to sit there, in front of people, when I was upset or not in a good place was one of the first steps I remember that led to my feeling dehumanized and worthless as a child.  I didn't even had ownership over my own emotions.  \n\nThank you for letting your kids regroup.", "Yeah that's one of the stupidest parenting comments I've ever seen.\n\nOP is literally encouraging the *opposite* of emotional regulation. Encouraging your kid to vent and shout at you as much as they want - to the point where the younger sibling is almost crying - and then not punishing them for it is ridiculous. Let me go rant at my employer for 10 minutes with a list of my frustrations and see what happens.....\n\nBeing in a bad mood is ok, kids shouldn't be punished for being in a bad mood. But they absolutely should be punished for lack of emotional regulation and self control when upset. It astonishes me that the comment has over 100 upvotes.", "It's almost as if when we properly model emotional regulation consistently and regularly our kids will too! I kid but it was a revelation for me. I can be very emotional so I've had to learn to always make sure my kids know when I'm grumpy/sensitive and it's not about them in advance. I tell them specifically what my needs are or not and they've learned to do the same. You'd think this would be a bad approach but it makes it so they don't feel like they have to walk on eggshells or like theres a ticking time bomb about to go off, so they don't need to take care of me when I'm not feeling well. Which is a lot because I have health problems. It's just oh dads having a bad morning again, he'll be fine and we get through it together.. be honest with your kids about struggles but don't make them responsible for them. More than anything they just need context so they can digest why things are tough.", "\"no one can make you feel a way without your consent.\"\n\nThat is not true, so the rest of that Pseudo Profound Bullshit* is based on a false premise. \n\n*This is actual terminology for it.", "fair enough\ud83d\ude2d", "Exactly, parents are people too and no one is perfect. Saying he abused his daughter by denying her dinner is a reach, abuse completely lost its meaning.", "Yeah it's not like AITA has a character limit that requires you to put some of the context out unless you are very good at resuming.", "Did we have the same mother?", "Wow. This was hard to read. The previous commenter was emotionally abused, and you're talking like they deserved it and projected a bunch of things they *might* have done to deserve it.\n\nIf a story about an abusive parent hits too close to home, maybe that's on you, and not some abused kid.\n\nFor example, I got hit and screamed at for having a door open into my face. Do you want to presume that was payback for \"being nasty to family members who care about you\"?\n\nSounds like you might have *some* awareness. Please, if you really do care about your kids, actively try to be better. Find someone to talk to for you and the kids.", "Wow, you said the thing! I was never allowed to run off to my room when I was feeling those huge feelings, and it traumatized me to no end. Even to this day I don't feel safe with my feelings, because I wasn't allowed to go to my room until my mother said I could, often after she had finished berating me or we had finished a stone- silent dinner. Thank you for .. well, sharing.", "Which person are you disagreeing with?  \n\nBecause your points line up with disagreeing with the person above me but you replied to me.", "Emotional regulation and self control are skills you need to learn and practice. Even a lot of adults don't have them all the time. Punishing a child for lacking them in an emotional moment and sending them to their room won't teach them any skills for dealing with their emotions, it just sends the message that they're not accepted and their own to deal with.", "Yeah, the throwing away the food really stuck out to me because it's such a disproportionate response. I mean okay teenage attitude sucks, but if the issue was she didn't like the food why can't she just go like make a sandwich or something? Cereal? \n\nThe parents taking away food privileges, essentially, is just a power move. It doesn't do anything to address the root issue, it just helps the adult regain total control of the situation. The problem with this is when maintaining a high level of control is always the motivation behind revoking privileges, that's abuse. \n\nAnd another thing, when you tell your own fucking kid it's time for them to provide for themself and get a job and stop eating YOUR food, you may not realize the long term harm you're causing. A kid (of any age) needs to feel secure in their home which includes the security if knowing that their parents, who are responsible for raising and nurturing them , are not going to commodify each one of their basic needs and use them as leverage tools. You're teaching your kid that she can't trust you to support her, so don't expect her to ever talk to you about teenage girl things! You've also just proven that her place among the family mealtime is conditional. This translates in teenage brain to \"no one wants me to join *their* dinner\" because she had an attitude once? \n\nThere's a deeper implication to you revoking your kids basic needs. Not only will they not trust you if you keep doing that, they'll never trust anyone. It is YOUR job to teach your children that they are safe at home and that they are worth and deserving of food, shelter, warmth, and socialization *at the very least* but they will leave your home thinking that they are only welcome in places where they can contribute whatever someone else decides is *equally valuble*  as the resources used by them being there. \n\nCongrats, you've told your kid that she doesn't contribute enough to have a half cup of your milk and has to go out and find a way to buy her own groceries. You've reframed her as an obligatory debt to you, not as a child you chose to have and want to get to know and understand her communication needs.", "In general to the using food as punishment\u2026.not just to you, hellscape goat, but using food as a penalty or punishment is a really great way to cause eating disorders (which you kind of say) but OP should really consider, is his tantrum about her tantrum worth the possible risk of a life long issue surrounding her food intake?   \nThis is one of those YTA and so much so that you\u2019re embarrassing yourself for posting here and if you truly need to ask in this case, you need serious help.  For real,  seek family counseling.  And dude. Teenagers have a propensity to be AH themselves during those years.  Weather the storm, dad.  It\u2019ll pass.  Support her through it. You making it worse will not make it better. \n\nThis is kind of an ESH but, you\u2019re the grown adult, thus, OP, YTA.", "Yup. The thing I got with OP was the daughter was in \"a bad mood for who knows what reason\". I mean, maybe it was something that even she would see as insignificant once she calmed down, but maybe it was something really serious! And she's sure as shit not going to tell OP about it, because she's going to think that all he cares about is that she pretends to be cheerful.\n\nSo yeah, OP, if you ever find yourself wondering why your daughter doesn't talk to you about things...", "That method would certainly make mine worse!", "\"Ahhh yeah, take a good long look, depressed me. You see those black spots? It's your teeth you ruined because you didn't have the energy to brush twice a day like a normal person. Look! You see those gray, messy hairs? That's because you failed to go to the hairdresser for a decade! Hey maybe you wouldn't have such bad skin if you had been bothered to care for it! And that weight you put on? You even fail at being thin when you don't eat! What? Feeling uncomfortable? You should look around at how filthy your house is.\"\n\n\nYeah, that's certainly going to cure the depression! Go for it! Thank your colleague for curing everyone! Who would have thought it was that easy all along! No need for doctors or meds. Just smile in the mirror!", "> Punishing a child for lacking them in an emotional moment and sending them to their room won't teach them any skills for dealing with their emotions, \n\nThat's completely untrue. \n\nConsistent, fair and predictable consequences that are clearly linked to the negative behaviour are well established as being vital to the development of emotional regulation in children. When there are no negative consequences for negative behaviour children have no incentive to learn how to express their emotions in productive ways. \n\nThe whole point of consequences is so that they do develop emotional regulation, saying that it's pointless because they don't have them isn't a logical argument or even an argument at all.", "The Suffering Olympics.
