I'm (44) a single dad to two kids \"Audrey\" (16) and \"Emily\" (12). We have a great relationship but Audrey can sometimes be rude and demeaning, saying cruel things casually when she's displeased about something or in a bad mood. Emily (her little sister) looks up to her, often mimicking her behavior which obviously worries me.\n\nI cooked a nice Sunday dinner and Audrey stormed downstairs in a bad mood for who knows what reason. She was being a downer whereas Emily and I were cheerful. I asked her to improve her mood please instead of ruining the dinner, she turned to me and unleashed her anger. To quote some of her elegant words: \"can you stop lecturing for once, you're annoying as f\\*ck and seriously you're the one who ruins everything\".\n\nI stood up, took her plate, and dumped it in the trashcan. I told her since she can't bother to show me any basic respect, she should start providing for herself from now on. She said she'll make cereal and maybe I was an AH, I said no that's my milk and she should get a job to get her own groceries. I don't feel like i yelled at her, I felt I spoke calmly but when she realized I was being serious, she got upset and started crying and ran to her room.\n\nWe haven't talked since. Obviously she's mad at me but now my younger daughter is mad at me too, saying I acted like a huge jerk to her sister. I of course don't see it that way, I don't tolerate being spoken to with such disrespect and it did hurt me a lot hearing Audrey say these things to me that were uncalled for.\n\nSo was I the asshole? Obviously not winning any \"dad of the year\" award but will I be winning any \"AH of the year\" award?\n\nedit: forgot to include that my daughter also made a snide comment about the food not looking good, which was what triggered me to throw her plate away\n\nedit 2: I did ask her, twice, at the beginning what was wrong and why she was in such a bad mood. Her response was a sarcastic \"you wouldn't get it\". I asked why not, she just sighed\n\nedit 3: of course i'm not going to starve her. I was just trying to make a point to her.\n\nedit 4: vast majority of you think I'm the AH. I'll apologize and give her her cereal.", "created_utc": 1681698597, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12oylc2/aita_for_dumping_my_teenage_daughters_dinner_in/", "score": 4762, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe you\u2019re making her feel unheard, or uncared for - children usually lash out because they don\u2019t know how to deal with their anger. I suggest you have a talk, maybe family therapy. I also suggest you don\u2019t starve your daughter and make her feel like a burden when she\u2019s obviously in a contentious place - not cool to have a child and then expect them to provide for themselves just because you feel like/they are being a dick.

YTA again.", "YTA Why didn\u2019t you ask her what was wrong?", "YTA\n\nDon't use food as punishment.

All of us have not so perfect moments as parents, and this is one of them, but it doesn't make you TA.  The few times my kids acted like this, I sent them to their room and told them to come back when they could have a mature conversation. We then have a conversation about their words. I would ask Audrey why she feels you deserve to be talked to that way and how she would feel to be called annoying as f*ck.  My kids very rarely give me an attitude as they dont want to have the hours long conversation with me about their actions, feelings, etc... I bore them into good behavior.  Audrey's old enough to understand the weight of her words and that they potentially have consequences. You had a lapse in parenting judgment, you'll do better next time!", "YTA.

Food is not a given, but something that can be taken away at every minute. And you will not provide for her and are really unsafe to be around. My mother took my food away when I was a child. And this made me eat everything as fast as I could no matter if I was hungry. Who knew when the food would be taken away? I needed to eat it before this happened. To this day I have an unhealthy relationship to food. I am a really fat woman. I have no controll and I have no idea how to decide when I get full. \n\nPlease don't do this.\n\nThe main problem is that you try to force your daughter to regulate her feelings when you never tought her how to do this. I am not surprised. You don't know how to do it yourself. You were hurt by what she said and you did react without considering her side. You are the adult. You need to stay calm and take the punches without leashing out.\n\nSomething you can try next time: \"I see that you are in a bad mood. You are allowed to be in a bad mood, but you are not allowed to take it out on me. You can either eat your food in silence or you can go to your room until you calmed down while your food waits here for you, but I don't want to be spoken to like this.\"\n\nAnd then let her choose. When she calmed down you can talk to her how she made you feel. That it is hurtful if she says this things about the food as it is expensive to buy and you put work into it. Let her work on solutions for this situation if she feels like this again. She is mad. Is she mad at you? Than she should tell you. Is she not mad at you? She can talk about her feelings if she wants to, or she can write them down or she can spend some time alone. But she cannot be disrespectful to you.

I'm (44) a single dad to two kids \"Audrey\" (16) and \"Emily\" (12). We have a great relationship but Audrey can sometimes be rude and demeaning, saying cruel things casually when she's displeased about something or in a bad mood. Emily (her little sister) looks up to her, often mimicking her behavior which obviously worries me.\n\nI cooked a nice Sunday dinner and Audrey stormed downstairs in a bad mood for who knows what reason. She was being a downer whereas Emily and I were cheerful. I asked her to improve her mood please instead of ruining the dinner, she turned to me and unleashed her anger. To quote some of her elegant words: \"can you stop lecturing for once, you're annoying as f\\*ck and seriously you're the one who ruins everything\".\n\nI stood up, took her plate, and dumped it in the trashcan. I told her since she can't bother to show me any basic respect, she should start providing for herself from now on. She said she'll make cereal and maybe I was an AH, I said no that's my milk and she should get a job to get her own groceries. I don't feel like i yelled at her, I felt I spoke calmly but when she realized I was being serious, she got upset and started crying and ran to her room.\n\nWe haven't talked since. Obviously she's mad at me but now my younger daughter is mad at me too, saying I acted like a huge jerk to her sister. I of course don't see it that way, I don't tolerate being spoken to with such disrespect and it did hurt me a lot hearing Audrey say these things to me that were uncalled for.\n\nSo was I the asshole? Obviously not winning any \"dad of the year\" award but will I be winning any \"AH of the year\" award?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Dude, she's a minor. It's your job to provide for her. How is she supposed to get a job on the spot?

Good Luck", "Parenting is hard, and sometimes, we lose it. I get that 100%. My son is 14, and he has been going through it lately, and guess who eats 99% of his shit? Me. Have I always acted with grace and patience? No, I have not, I am human, I also have pride, and my ego is sometimes wounded by what he says or does, and I have limits. I have lost it, I have yelled when I shouldn't, and I have said things that were also not kind that I regretted.\n\nWhen this happens, I take 5 minutes and get myself in order, I give him time to cool off also, and I start a conversation with an apology, let him decide if he accepts it or not and if he wants to talk about it or not. Usually, he accepts, and we have a chat. Just because I am an adult doesn't make me always in the right. Kids unload on where their unconditional love is, unfortunately. \n\nTaking away food is not the route I would go. You need to clear that up with her. Teenagers are hormonal nightmares on top of the insanity they are living through at the moment. Take a moment and think about all the shit that has been bombarded on them in the past few years, we think it doesn't affect them as much, but it does. They have learned about environmental crisis and how damaged the world and environment are. The political climate is always discussed, and it is hard for us to deal with and understand. It is even scarier for them. Covid happened to them, too, and one day, they were just all sent back to school, with few resources to help them cope. They deal with a lot, and we just don't see it as that serious because they are kids. \n\nTelling someone to be happy when they aren't usually has the opposite effect. Does that mean she gets to speak to you any way she pleases? No, it doesn't. You could have asked her if she would like to eat alone or have something else since she is not feeling great. It was your ego that was hurt by her remarks about your food. It was you that was upset that your plans of a nice dinner were not going how you wanted it to because she wasn't playing the part you wanted her to. Those were your expectations that got crushed, and it led you to react how you did to her disrespect.\n\nSo, be the adult, and talk to her. Do not expect her to accept your apology. That is up to her. Set up some reasonable ground rules of how you wish to be treated and what behaviors are unacceptable(for example, I let my son swear, in conversation but swearing at me is unacceptable, he can say this fucking sucks, but not you fucking suck), and what the consequences will be in the future. Also, her sister may look up to her, but it is not her responsibility to be a role model. It is amazing if she wants to be, but it isn't her job. Let her know you are there for her, and as hard as it is for her to imagine, you were her age at one point, and you understand and remember what it was like, and that she can talk to you. Try to just listen, I like to say, \"Is this venting, or do you want some problem solving help?\" She may just need to be heard sometimes. Also, be open with your feelings. You are human, and sometimes they forget that, like telling her what she said hurt your feelings, and that is why you reacted out of anger and wounded pride, but that isn't acceptable, that is not how to treat people you love and care for and you will work on that because you do not want her to think that is ok. You are the man in her life at the moment, and she is learning from you what is acceptable treatment for the future. Remember that.\n\nLook up resources and seek counseling if you can, for all of you.

No. For trust issues, food scarcity mindset, and therefore boosting her chances for developing disordered eating, which she is already at great risk for, verbal and emotional abuse committed by a \u201cparent\u201d, and impending LC or NC when she grows up.\nNah, you can rest your little head, and have your happy-go-lucky toxic positivity fueled dreams, sponsored by the cult of parents that refuse to work in themselves yet expect their kids to be better, despite not having role models to copy.\nSpeaking of role models, I came up with a nickname for you.\nSleep tight, and sweet dreams cheese puff.\nYTA, in case you are actually too dense to realize that at this point - which I have real concern for.\nGet therapy.", "\u201cI\u2019ll apologize and give her her cereal\u201d.

My man. This girl is 16. She is a child.

Like damn, some adult you are if you can't provide for your daughter just because you're too thin skinned and delicate to handle a bit of moodiness from a literal teenager. \n\nI'm getting the vibe that you resent being a parent. Like I'll be honest, my first impression was that you're probably handling this situation like you're also a teenager because you had kids too young  and never had a change to emotionally devolp past that mentality. But 44 (your age) - 16 (age of daughter) - 1 (plus about a year for pregnancy, rounded up) = 27. For a lot of people that's still too young, but like. For the math I was expecting to work, you'd have to be 34 right now.\n\nI don't mean to rag on you too much, daddy-o. Single fatherhood's got to be hard. That said, I think you really should consider taking better care of yourself. Maybe try therapy and/or a career change? Take a vacation? Day spay? Change in diet in exercise regimen? Assuming you can afford any of those things - money is fucking tough sometimes. My point is that the way you seem to treat your daughter in this post really makes is seem like you're having trouble extending empathy to her because you're too wrapped up in yourself, possibly because you're not very content or cared for. \n\nUnfortunately your daughters aren't people who can take care of you right now. If you do good by them, they'll probably take care of you when they're both real adults and your body starts failing, but right now unfortunately you have to take care of yourself. So, my advice: Apologize to your damn daughter, make sure she has something to eat, and after that sit down and take a good think on what you want out of life that you can get, or at least get closer to. Like, I want 5 million dollars and a perfect body, but neither of those are ever going to happen for me. However, in the past few years I've lost about 20 pounds and saved up a couple thousand dollars, you know? It ain't much, but just that I've made progress on it makes me a lot happier and able to extend kindness to others.\n\nBut back to your daughter - She really needs her daddy right now. Like, being 16 fucking sucks regardless of you're gender, but also consider that \\*you\\* probably \\*wouldn't\\* understand some of the problems a 16 year old girl might face. That's not your fault, you're a dude, you know? But getting all pissy at your daughter and withholding food from her really kind of confirms and drives home that not only would you not understand whatever problem she's facing, but that you really have no interest in trying to understand either. Really did not make yourself someone she can rely on with your behavior at all. In the very least, if you can't make her life easier, try not to make it worse. I think you'll find that if you stick to doing that for a few months, your daughter will start repaying the favor.\n\nGood luck.", "YTA.", "YTA. Your behavior is sickening towards your child.

I can tell you for sure, I wasn't talking about any of that stuff with my family and definitely not my dad. And them saying \"are you mad?\" Or \"cheer up, you're ruing xyz\" was a cheat code to an angry teenage girl, on top of whatever else was happening in my head. She's gonna have lots of big feelings, and that's healthy. Forcing only positive feelings, especially in her own home, which SHOULD be a safe space, is NOT healthy.

Bonus, you're modeling that you don't have to let someone else's words hurt you. Also, saying mean things to get a reaction doesn't work.\n\nWhat your punishments are teaching her is not \"use nice words\", it's \"those emotions are bad.\" Focus on how to recognize and manage those emotions.

Two, this is where gentle/responsive parenting may be helpful because it\u2019s about creating the sense of choice and autonomy in the constricts of the lack of autonomy (no candy for dinner, but she can have a piece alongside dinner or here are her options in Roblox etc). A big thing with kids to remember is that they have very little sense of emotional regulation, and we as adults tend to try to hold them to adult standards that adults don\u2019t even do (your comment on everyone has a bad day including me but that doesn\u2019t mean we get to make people around us suffer as much as we are).

Important to remember that negative attention is always better than no attention, and sending her away can unintentionally reinforce that. Can you spend 5 minutes doing a check in on how her mood is before dinner? You tolerating her big feelings is a part of your job as parent, so witnessing them and honoring the feeling without the request is really important.

If she did, it still would not make her behavior okay, but it would make it understandable, just to be clear.\n\nImo, you are letting her misbehavior go on far too long. When she begins to complain or says something rude, calmly remind her that \"we do not speak rudely like that in this house. If you do it again, you will have to go to your room until you are ready to be polite.\"\n\n**And then you follow through.**\n\nHer behavior may escalate at first, but it should taper off quickly once she realizes that you are actually serious and there will be consequences for her actions and words.

Two suggestions for you. \n\nNumber one: in my house, the rule is either you eat what's for dinner, or you make your own (which includes cleaning up after yourself). My kids don't want what I've made? Then they can make themselves a PB&J, or a quesadilla, or whatever else is in their skill range.\n\nNumber two: if she complains about meals a lot, then consider having her help with meal planning and prep.\n\nHonestly, if your daughter isn't getting in trouble for similar behavior at school, then she's acting out because she's learned she can get away with it at home. If she can control herself at school, then she can do it at home.\n\nTo summarize: You need to set out clear rules and boundaries *before* bad behavior starts. Lay out what the consequences will be for either kid breaking the rules. If they break a minor rule, I typically give one reminder of the rule and consequences. If it was serious misbehavior, like hurting someone, then no reminders, straight to consequences. Stay calm and don't yell when enforcing rules and consequences, because some kids thrive off the negative attention. And then stick with the rules. Be firm and consistent.

School?  A job?  Success?  Failure?  And what is she going to do with her life?  She's SIXTEEN, and that ain't easy.  \n\nSo she's in a bad mood and what do you do?  Let her be while you and sis talk and laugh till she joins in - or not - and let her have her space?  No, you confront her, telling her to improve her mood b/c she's ruining dinner.  On what planet would that work with ANYone in a bad mood? \n\nHad she said, \"Well, dad, you seem to be disgruntled.  Improve your mood b/c you're ruining our dinner,\" would you have instantly turned into Mr. Happy?  \n\nThen you threw away her food, another AH move, and told her to fend for herself - only then you informed her that you own all the food and she can't have any unless she gets a job and buys her own food. \n\nClue for you: when you ask someone what is wrong and they don't tell you, shut up.  Quit asking.  Just say something noncommittal like, \"I wish I could make it better, whatever it is.\"  \n\nAnd don't be so sure you aren't already starving her.  Withholding food, withholding your support and understanding...\n\nYou need to apologize to her and forget the cereal.  Get her a pizza.

It\u2019s taught me that my emotions are abnormal and shameful and that I need to apologise and immediately remove myself, when I feel \u201cemotions\u201d coming on. It\u2019s taught me that emotions are scary and dangerous. Basically it taught me that I can never be myself, not even amongst my closest circle of people - it\u2019s just too risky. They might end up hating me.\n\nI\u2019ve since found out that my \u201ctemper tantrums\u201d and \u201cbad moods\u201d might actually have been autistic burnout and meltdowns, and that I\u2019m very, very affected by light, sounds and textures. My brain is nowhere near as effective at filtering out inputs as a \u201cnormal\u201d persons brain. \n\nWith that in mind it\u2019s starting to make sense how a (to other people) completely mundane thing could ruin my day/send me over the edge - I\u2019m already SO filled up with sounds and light and textures that I don\u2019t have a lot of room for other stuff going wrong, or something being different than how it usually is. \nMy brain doesn\u2019t always have the capacity to both deal with all these sensory inputs AND the everyday bs we all encounter.\nAdd (further) to that my lacking social skills, and some days just existing in the world becomes an insurmountable task.\n\nNow, at 28, I\u2019m finally starting to develop an understanding and a language around my autism, and it\u2019s helped immensely!

Go talk and communicate with her tell her how her comments made you feel and apologize for your actions and ask her what\u2019s going on, let her know that you\u2019re a safe person she can talk to, even if she\u2019s having a bad time", "Nta", "Dudes going on reddit for parenting advice.

The father had asked her multiple times what is wrong and she didn\u2019t give him a chance to try to help her. and obviously the father is not going to starve his daughter he was just making a point.", "Well it sounds like most of this is your fault. You have allowed her to get away with this behavior for 16 years. You need to stop this now and before she gets out on her own you need to start setting some really tough and hard rules for her.

I believe that you have to reset expectations with kids at least 3 times before they are grown. This usually occurs when they make a leap in self awareness.

If there was no yelling you did well.", "Yeah, from reading this I really feel like you're one of those guys who continuously says \"you should smile more.\"... I also have a strong feeling that this isn't the only time you've been the a-hole. Teenagers are GOING to be rude, but threatening them with no food definitely isn't the way to go about solving it, that can cause them to very quickly lose their trust in you (if they had any to begin with) especially if you're their primary provider. A much, MUCH better response to a foul mood would have been \"hey, what's wrong?\" If she said she doesn't want to talk, or something along those lines say \"ok, well if you change your mind, you can come to me later.\" Or even let her know she can take her food to her room and eat, if she wanted to be alone. Most likely it was something that happened at school, so you could also have reminded her \"I was a teen too, once upon a time.\" When she said \"you wouldn't get it.\" And she might have actually opened up to you then...", "NTA.

So people on reddit seem to be perfect parents with everything in their parenting going very well or they have perfect parents that stood by when they disrespected them. The girl needed some discipline for being that rude. She can throw her tantrum but not in front of food. I was taught that having food on the table is a blessing and to never disrespect it. So yeah, if you act like that and you even have the gall to curse at me, I'll do the same as OP. Maybe not throwing the food in the trash can but I will deny it for her nonetheless.

Geez.", "YTA. \n\nShe probably didn\u2019t want to confide in you because of how you dismiss her emotions and tell her that she was \u2018ruining dinner\u2019.

Also telling her to \u2018improve her mood\u2019?  That\u2019s like suggesting that a depressed person should \u2018just smile\u2019. You could have been compassionate and suggest that she can eat in her room if she doesn\u2019t feel well instead of \u2018ruining\u2019 your dinner. \n\nAnd yes she may have been rude, but that isn\u2019t a reason to withhold food or ever threaten to take away her basic needs.

I\u2019m sure there is more going on than meets the eye. And it is never okay to withhold food from your child, or anyone from that matter. It can cause major problems emotionally. I was withheld food when I was younger and now I have eating problems due to the fact that I do not think I deserve to eat sometimes, even over trivial things. I\u2019m getting working on it personally, but your words and actions will be ingrained throughout her life wether you like it or not. \n\nYour younger daughter is watching too.

Take it from a woman with several mental health diagnoses - she's not being difficult just to spite you, mate. Teenagers ARE moody. And there is absolutely zero you can do about that other than support them through this tough time. There are a whole plethora of perfectly valid reasons I can think of for her mood just from the top of my head:  \nDepression  \nAnxiety disorders  \nA break up   \nPMS  \nPain (like painful menstruations, for example, because as a woman with PCOS, let me tell ya, if someone wanted to force me into a polite conversation when I'm trying not to cry from the pain in my stomach, back, thighs, chest and emotions, I'd want to rip someone's head off, because at that time I just need the world to ignore my existence whilst I suffer in silence)  \nBullying at school  \n\n\nYour children are human beings. Whole human beings. With whole ranges of human emotions. And there will NEVER come a day when you can control them. What you get to do is choose who you're going to be to her - her rock, her saviour, her confidant, her place to go to when she feels bad, or another stick in her wheels that to her feel already full of sticks.   \n\n\nHer feelings and her mood are perfectly valid. She does not owe you anything. Literally anything. YOU had her, not the other way around. She didn't pick you. She didn't choose to be there. YOU made her. And YOU are responsible to take care of her.   \n\n\nMy mum was a single mum, I absolutely know it's difficult and overwhelming, and I'm glad you are there and trying your best (hopefully). But maybe read some books about teenagers? How to parent teenagers maybe? Parents make mistakes, and that's just how things are. But you do still have time to change your relationship with them. Her behaviour is a signal she needs help, not scorn, not YOUR attitude, not YOUR standards for how she should act in her home. You need to start looking at your children as individuals instead of extensions of you.   \n\n\nIf you were having a bad day, would her going 'improve your mood, please, instead of ruining the dinner' make it oh so much better? You know perfectly well how you'd feel about that comment.   \n\n\nAlso, I want to add that the 'you wouldn't get it' is a pretty telling line on her part. I expect she has tried to talk to you like a reasonable person and you've either dismissed her feelings or made it about yourself. My mum was very supportive of me and even though I only got my diagnoses later on, in my twenties, I was always able to trust her and talk to her. The words 'you wouldn't get it' would have never left my lips, because she 100% would have gotten whatever it was I needed to tell her.   \n\n\nIt might seem like teenage drama is not a big deal to you, but it is certainly a big deal to the teenagers involved in it. So even if it's only some relationship strain with friends or a boyfriend who's messaged another girl, to her it's still a big part of her life and world, and has a big impact on how she feels. You're not at all concerned for her, not at all helping. I am absolutely in no way surprised for her attitude towards you tbh.   \n\n\nAs for myself, I was very moody. It was my undiagnosed depression and several undiagnosed anxiety disorders.

It seems like every one of you people just glossed on by the fact that he asked her what was wrong, and she belittled his offer of help.  Exactly how many times is he supposed to ask, in the age of \"gental bs\" parenting?  Apparently, this wasn't the first time she'd acted this way either, so I'm sure it's not the first time he's asked.  Exactly how much is he supposed to let his kids push the boundaries before he says f that attitude? \n\nAs far as his response/behavior goes, it was also over the top. I can see telling her \" if his cooking isn't good enough for her, then she doesn't have to eat it, but you're not allowed to leave the table.\" Then I'd let her sit there and sulk in silence until she was ready to tell me the problem. If she's going to act like a toddler, she can get a time out like a toddler. No electronics, no distractions, just silence for her to reflect on why I deserved her scorn because of someone else making her angry.  If it turns out that it was something dad did that made her angry,  then talking to him about it is what two reasonable people should be doing. That's how kids learn to be functional adults, and it's something that would be beneficial for your sibling to witness. A 16 yo should be adult enough to understand that fact.

This is, ironically, clearly a lesson dad never had.\n\nGoing to her room might be part of this solution, but she should be given some choice in the matter - ask if she's upset and wants to talk about it, or if she just needs to be alone for a while. She should be given these choices explicitly, not in a condescending \"well clearly you made your choice already\" way.", "I get your point that all parents can have a lapse in judgement and I can see a mostly good parent over-reacting, but for one, the OP's over-reaction was quite extreme, and for two I don't think that being a mostly good parent automatically means NTA when you do screw up. The judgement of YTA or NTA is for that particular scenario, and it is doesn't matter if OP has 16 years of being a perfect parent before that day, he was still the AH that day.\n\nI actually think it's a very noxious justification for a parent to say to themselves \"All parents screw up sometimes, so I never have to admit to being wrong\". I think a healthy parent is able to screw up sometimes, recognise it as a screw up, and try to do better next time.\n\nI don't think it makes them a permanent AH, no more than I think anyone is a permanent AH. That's not what AITA is about.", ">All of us have not so perfect moments\n\nIt's not just a \"not perfect moment.\" He didn't even *try* to start this off correctly. 16 year old is in a bad mood? Ask questions. Give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe they are experiencing something serious. Maybe it's not serious, and if that becomes apparent then you shift to giving them a few options, like eating alone if they don't want to be around others or staying with them if they can be a little kinder. Dad didn't do any of this, because he has no idea how to regulate emotions. He just commanded her to not feel bad without asking her what's wrong first. That's just blatantly the wrong approach. It is rude and self-centered - \"You feel bad? Well how do you think that makes *ME* feel?!\"\n\n>Her missing 1 meal is not going to ruin her for life and is not abuse\n\nWitholding food from a minor *is fucking abuse.* Just because it's not as explosive as striking a child with physical force doesn't mean it isn't still abuse. You're just factually incorrect here. Learn with society. This is the standard, and it's good to have rising standards.\n\n>The few times my kids acted like this, I sent them to their room and told them to come back when they could have a mature conversation. We then have a conversation about their words.\n\nThat's not terrible. Why are you letting Dad here off the hook? Again, he's 44, he should know that this is closer to what his goal should be. The fact that he didn't know this and didn't even try to get to the bottom of her feelings is what makes him the AH here.\n\n\n\n>I would ask Audrey why she feels you deserve to be talked to that way and how she would feel to be called annoying as f*ck.\n\nYou're focusing on the wrong part of the conversation here. Dad provoked her response. It's not fair to provoke a response like this and then focus on dissecting every part of it like this first. If Dad said \"please pass me the gravy\" and she said that then this would be a good approach, but that ship has sailed.\n\n>My kids very rarely give me an attitude as they dont want to have the hours long conversation with me about their actions, feelings, etc... I bore them into good behavior.\n\nI'm a little bit curious about how serious this is. Do you truly think you just bore your kids? Do you think they are actually learning how to communicate and healthily work through emotions? This approach sounds similar to how older generations might just spank and punish until the kids learned to behave a particular way around parents to avoid the responses, but instead of physical strikes you use \"boredom\" as the stick. If that's accurate that isn't healthy either. Maybe you're being a little humorous here, though, so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt on that.\n\n>Audrey's old enough to understand the weight of her words and that they potentially have consequences. You had a lapse in parenting judgment,\n\nThis is just bizarre and is clearly a generational sides-taking. You say that the 16 year old is \"old enough to understand\" but the 45 year old \"had a lapse in judgement.\" Really? Why does the 44 year old get a pass and the 16 year old get judged? That just seems backwards immediately. But crucially, it was the 44 year old who provoked a response from the 16 year old that you seem to not at all understand, somehow?\n\nThis doesn't pass the smell test. You seem more like my parents who could never ever do wrong or admit fault and any conflict was always my fault for not being subordinate enough.

It was \"Oh you feel bad? Well too bad. It's ruining OUR dinner!\" Then she called him out for being a dick. It was over the top, but otherwise she was correct. Again, she's 16, he's 44.

But it\u2019s not. As the parent/adult, he should be modeling the way to handle stress and frustration, not just handling it as badly as she did and feeling justified in doing so. \n\nAnd threatening to withhold basic necessities from your minor child, even in the heat of the moment, is not okay.

She was only a freshman in high school and Lamp was a senior. They had only been dating a few weeks, and Lamp was about to move away for college. I couldn't convince her not to, so I switched gears. I texted her information on safe sex and consent hoping that if I couldn't stop it, I could at least help Table and Lamp to be safe. Unbeknownst to Table, her parents read her text messages. Table's father told my parents that Table and I were sexting. My parents took my bedroom door for the next year even though I kept trying to get them to read my text messages. My parents' house had one bathroom for 11 people, 3 of which were my brothers, 2 of which were my male cousins, and 1 of which was my grandfather with Alzheimer's. Suffice to say I had no privacy and changing in a closet built in the 1800s, isn't as glamorous as it sounds. \n\nMy parents have always reacted harshly whenever they feel one of my siblings or I acted badly. I once got fired from a job. My mother responded by not giving me anything for my birthday that year, including a card, text, or phone call. She told me specifically that she wanted me to know how disappointed she was in me so that I wouldn't do it again in the future. \n\nI text my mother-in-law every single day first thing in the morning to check in.

My parents didn't do this meaning they let SO much slide- I said such awful things and was a total jerk for most of my teen years (literally slapped my mom in the face at 16) and in retrospect, it wasn't good or helpful for me in the long run. It didn't make me any closer to her, it didn't help me respect them anymore, etc.  You can't just run your mouth and be a jerk to people bc you're in a bad mood- it's why we see news daily of adults having temper tantrums and not realizing that the world doesn't revolve around them.  I talk with my daughter and son a lot about how we understand what it feels like to be in a horrible mood or to have an awful day, week, month BUT that doesn't mean they get a free pass to be hateful. And we also try and model what we ask of them- if I get frustrated and lose my temper a bit and maybe say something I don't quite mean I purposely remove myself from the situation, calm myself and go back and apologize and ask for forgiveness. We don't expect perfection but we do expect respect which we try and show them by apologizing and truly trying to make a change. \n\nAnd I have significant health challenges and live in constant pain so I understand just feeling like you have no control over your life but again, it's not something I use as an excuse to be hateful. If it DOES come out on a particularly bad day, it still has consequences. Family can be the safe place where you do get a do-over, but it serves no one to have zero consequences for your actions because that's not real life.", "NTA, imo. I was that teenager once and we can be insufferable people. I remember specifically just being a brat for no other reason than the sake of being a brat. I had a younger brother who was much easier to manage than I was and my parents had the same concerns of my behavior rubbing off on him. He was very partial to me and though he wouldn't act out, he was always worried about me when I would get mouthy and grounded. I spent my entire freshman year grounded first for grades, secondly for lying about them, then third for arguing about lying about the bad grades.\n\nGuess what? I made it out alive and as a decent adult. I was tough loved hard from about 13-17 but I cannot imagine what an awful person I might have been had I been allowed to get away with my shitty behavior.", "NTA: You did the right thing but just go talk to her.

The fact that she was disrespectful to you is problematic because of how it makes you feel and all you did was show her that you can also make her feel bad. You showed her that the proper response to being hurt by someone you care about is to hurt them back.

You're supposed to be the adult in the house and the parent and you could have parented her in this instance but you chose to go the route of acting like a child yourself.

We can all be better and we all make mistakes. My advice is to apologize to both of your daughters for reacting poorly and being a poor role model/parent. Then I would explain to both of your daughters that even when they are in a bad mood they can't take it out on other people, such as their parents. In the future I'd recommend other punishments for poor behavior than throwing her food in the trash in front of her.\n\nThis will pass, though.

Telling her just out of the blue that she had to find a job if she wanted to eat was vile.", "Yes.

It\u2019s because the \u201cthing\u201d that\u2019s making her feel mad is just her brain being overwhelmed by life, but she probably doesn\u2019t really know that yet.

Her dad *is* an asshole and clearly did way more to ruin their family dinner than her moody 16 year old frown. Again, she's 16 and was provoked here.
