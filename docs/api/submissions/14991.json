I'm (44) a single dad to two kids \"Audrey\" (16) and \"Emily\" (12). We have a great relationship but Audrey can sometimes be rude and demeaning, saying cruel things casually when she's displeased about something or in a bad mood. Emily (her little sister) looks up to her, often mimicking her behavior which obviously worries me.\n\nI cooked a nice Sunday dinner and Audrey stormed downstairs in a bad mood for who knows what reason. She was being a downer whereas Emily and I were cheerful. I asked her to improve her mood please instead of ruining the dinner, she turned to me and unleashed her anger. To quote some of her elegant words: \"can you stop lecturing for once, you're annoying as f\\*ck and seriously you're the one who ruins everything\".\n\nI stood up, took her plate, and dumped it in the trashcan. I told her since she can't bother to show me any basic respect, she should start providing for herself from now on. She said she'll make cereal and maybe I was an AH, I said no that's my milk and she should get a job to get her own groceries. I don't feel like i yelled at her, I felt I spoke calmly but when she realized I was being serious, she got upset and started crying and ran to her room.\n\nWe haven't talked since. Obviously she's mad at me but now my younger daughter is mad at me too, saying I acted like a huge jerk to her sister. I of course don't see it that way, I don't tolerate being spoken to with such disrespect and it did hurt me a lot hearing Audrey say these things to me that were uncalled for.\n\nSo was I the asshole? Obviously not winning any \"dad of the year\" award but will I be winning any \"AH of the year\" award?\n\nedit: forgot to include that my daughter also made a snide comment about the food not looking good, which was what triggered me to throw her plate away\n\nedit 2: I did ask her, twice, at the beginning what was wrong and why she was in such a bad mood. Her response was a sarcastic \"you wouldn't get it\". I asked why not, she just sighed\n\nedit 3: of course i'm not going to starve her. I was just trying to make a point to her.\n\nedit 4: vast majority of you think I'm the AH. I'll apologize and give her her cereal.", "created_utc": 1681698597, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12oylc2/aita_for_dumping_my_teenage_daughters_dinner_in/", "score": 429, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No. But she\u2019s probably going through something and could use some grace.

Or, tell her to go make herself something else. \n\nEdit 2: You're dad, she's a teen girl.  There will be many things you really WON'T get, or that she doesn't feel comfortable talking about.  Please make sure she has an older female she can confide in, or a therapist. \n\nEdit 3: what point was that, exactly?  That you're willing to cut her off on a dime, when she displeases you?

Withholding food as punishment is never a good idea and it will get you absolutely nowhere with your kid.", "So she clearly has a history of being overwhelmed and ran by her emotions... and instead of modeling behavior for her, you let her emotions overwhelm you as well, which lead to *your* emotions overwhelming you and it leading to a disaster of a situation with every member of the household being overwhelmed.\n\nSo... yeah YTA.

Maybe you\u2019re making her feel unheard, or uncared for - children usually lash out because they don\u2019t know how to deal with their anger. I suggest you have a talk, maybe family therapy. I also suggest you don\u2019t starve your daughter and make her feel like a burden when she\u2019s obviously in a contentious place - not cool to have a child and then expect them to provide for themselves just because you feel like/they are being a dick.

Sure, teenagers can be little shits, and power struggles suck, but you should NEVER deprive them of any basic need - food, shelter, clothing, etc as a punishment.

You failed your kid in so many ways.", "YTA\n\nYou should find some parenting classes. Taking away your child\u2019s meal has no benefits and teaches 0 lessons other than that adults also throw temper tantrums. Not the message you want to give.

YTA again.", "YTA Why didn\u2019t you ask her what was wrong?", "YTA\n\nDon't use food as punishment.

Yelling at her did not get your point across either, it made you look like the one who was lacking self control as bad as her.\n\nLead by example, be firm, but do not lose your temper. You have to make it right by her and admit what you just did was wrong, teaching her its okay to admit when you messed up.", "YTA\n\nBeing a single dad isn't an excuse for being a shitty parent. If you want your children to respect you, you earn that respect by becoming a positive role-model.

Look, being a single dad can be hard, but communication is key and it doesn't feel like there's any here.\n\n\nShe's a teenager going through puberty.

All of us have not so perfect moments as parents, and this is one of them, but it doesn't make you TA.  The few times my kids acted like this, I sent them to their room and told them to come back when they could have a mature conversation. We then have a conversation about their words. I would ask Audrey why she feels you deserve to be talked to that way and how she would feel to be called annoying as f*ck.  My kids very rarely give me an attitude as they dont want to have the hours long conversation with me about their actions, feelings, etc... I bore them into good behavior.  Audrey's old enough to understand the weight of her words and that they potentially have consequences. You had a lapse in parenting judgment, you'll do better next time!", "YTA.

Why should she respect yours?\n\nYou need to teach her how to grapple with her feelings and manage her moods and emotions.

So, she can't eat bc she's being a turd?", "For the future, here are some alternative things to say rather than asking her to fix her attitude. Remember that she is a person, and she\u2019s going to have emotions (ESPECIALLY getting flooded with hormones while in puberty):\n\n- \u201cWould you like to talk about what you\u2019re feeling?\u201d Or \u201cWould you like to talk about why you\u2019re not feeling good emotionally?\u201d\n\n- \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to talk, that\u2019s ok.

Food is not a given, but something that can be taken away at every minute. And you will not provide for her and are really unsafe to be around. My mother took my food away when I was a child. And this made me eat everything as fast as I could no matter if I was hungry. Who knew when the food would be taken away? I needed to eat it before this happened. To this day I have an unhealthy relationship to food. I am a really fat woman. I have no controll and I have no idea how to decide when I get full. \n\nPlease don't do this.\n\nThe main problem is that you try to force your daughter to regulate her feelings when you never tought her how to do this. I am not surprised. You don't know how to do it yourself. You were hurt by what she said and you did react without considering her side. You are the adult. You need to stay calm and take the punches without leashing out.\n\nSomething you can try next time: \"I see that you are in a bad mood. You are allowed to be in a bad mood, but you are not allowed to take it out on me. You can either eat your food in silence or you can go to your room until you calmed down while your food waits here for you, but I don't want to be spoken to like this.\"\n\nAnd then let her choose. When she calmed down you can talk to her how she made you feel. That it is hurtful if she says this things about the food as it is expensive to buy and you put work into it. Let her work on solutions for this situation if she feels like this again. She is mad. Is she mad at you? Than she should tell you. Is she not mad at you? She can talk about her feelings if she wants to, or she can write them down or she can spend some time alone. But she cannot be disrespectful to you. She will need to find a better way to deal with this.\n\nIt is a lot of work, but on the long run she will learn how to work through her emotions on her own.", "ESH. It\u2019s a sin to throw food in the trash, but since when is it okay for teenagers use the F word with their parents just for being asked to cheer up?

This kind of behavior is why I don't talk to my parents. You're exhausting. She's 16, she's hormonal, and she thinks she's the only person who feels the way she does.

I'm (44) a single dad to two kids \"Audrey\" (16) and \"Emily\" (12). We have a great relationship but Audrey can sometimes be rude and demeaning, saying cruel things casually when she's displeased about something or in a bad mood. Emily (her little sister) looks up to her, often mimicking her behavior which obviously worries me.\n\nI cooked a nice Sunday dinner and Audrey stormed downstairs in a bad mood for who knows what reason. She was being a downer whereas Emily and I were cheerful. I asked her to improve her mood please instead of ruining the dinner, she turned to me and unleashed her anger. To quote some of her elegant words: \"can you stop lecturing for once, you're annoying as f\\*ck and seriously you're the one who ruins everything\".\n\nI stood up, took her plate, and dumped it in the trashcan. I told her since she can't bother to show me any basic respect, she should start providing for herself from now on. She said she'll make cereal and maybe I was an AH, I said no that's my milk and she should get a job to get her own groceries. I don't feel like i yelled at her, I felt I spoke calmly but when she realized I was being serious, she got upset and started crying and ran to her room.\n\nWe haven't talked since. Obviously she's mad at me but now my younger daughter is mad at me too, saying I acted like a huge jerk to her sister. I of course don't see it that way, I don't tolerate being spoken to with such disrespect and it did hurt me a lot hearing Audrey say these things to me that were uncalled for.\n\nSo was I the asshole? Obviously not winning any \"dad of the year\" award but will I be winning any \"AH of the year\" award?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Good Luck", "Parenting is hard, and sometimes, we lose it. I get that 100%. My son is 14, and he has been going through it lately, and guess who eats 99% of his shit? Me. Have I always acted with grace and patience? No, I have not, I am human, I also have pride, and my ego is sometimes wounded by what he says or does, and I have limits. I have lost it, I have yelled when I shouldn't, and I have said things that were also not kind that I regretted.\n\nWhen this happens, I take 5 minutes and get myself in order, I give him time to cool off also, and I start a conversation with an apology, let him decide if he accepts it or not and if he wants to talk about it or not. Usually, he accepts, and we have a chat. Just because I am an adult doesn't make me always in the right. Kids unload on where their unconditional love is, unfortunately. \n\nTaking away food is not the route I would go. You need to clear that up with her. Teenagers are hormonal nightmares on top of the insanity they are living through at the moment. Take a moment and think about all the shit that has been bombarded on them in the past few years, we think it doesn't affect them as much, but it does. They have learned about environmental crisis and how damaged the world and environment are. The political climate is always discussed, and it is hard for us to deal with and understand. It is even scarier for them. Covid happened to them, too, and one day, they were just all sent back to school, with few resources to help them cope. They deal with a lot, and we just don't see it as that serious because they are kids. \n\nTelling someone to be happy when they aren't usually has the opposite effect. Does that mean she gets to speak to you any way she pleases? No, it doesn't. You could have asked her if she would like to eat alone or have something else since she is not feeling great. It was your ego that was hurt by her remarks about your food. It was you that was upset that your plans of a nice dinner were not going how you wanted it to because she wasn't playing the part you wanted her to. Those were your expectations that got crushed, and it led you to react how you did to her disrespect.\n\nSo, be the adult, and talk to her. Do not expect her to accept your apology. That is up to her. Set up some reasonable ground rules of how you wish to be treated and what behaviors are unacceptable(for example, I let my son swear, in conversation but swearing at me is unacceptable, he can say this fucking sucks, but not you fucking suck), and what the consequences will be in the future. Also, her sister may look up to her, but it is not her responsibility to be a role model. It is amazing if she wants to be, but it isn't her job. Let her know you are there for her, and as hard as it is for her to imagine, you were her age at one point, and you understand and remember what it was like, and that she can talk to you. Try to just listen, I like to say, \"Is this venting, or do you want some problem solving help?\" She may just need to be heard sometimes. Also, be open with your feelings. You are human, and sometimes they forget that, like telling her what she said hurt your feelings, and that is why you reacted out of anger and wounded pride, but that isn't acceptable, that is not how to treat people you love and care for and you will work on that because you do not want her to think that is ok. You are the man in her life at the moment, and she is learning from you what is acceptable treatment for the future. Remember that.\n\nLook up resources and seek counseling if you can, for all of you.

No. For trust issues, food scarcity mindset, and therefore boosting her chances for developing disordered eating, which she is already at great risk for, verbal and emotional abuse committed by a \u201cparent\u201d, and impending LC or NC when she grows up.\nNah, you can rest your little head, and have your happy-go-lucky toxic positivity fueled dreams, sponsored by the cult of parents that refuse to work in themselves yet expect their kids to be better, despite not having role models to copy.\nSpeaking of role models, I came up with a nickname for you.\nSleep tight, and sweet dreams cheese puff.\nYTA, in case you are actually too dense to realize that at this point - which I have real concern for.\nGet therapy.", "\u201cI\u2019ll apologize and give her her cereal\u201d.

My man. This girl is 16. She is a child.

Like damn, some adult you are if you can't provide for your daughter just because you're too thin skinned and delicate to handle a bit of moodiness from a literal teenager. \n\nI'm getting the vibe that you resent being a parent. Like I'll be honest, my first impression was that you're probably handling this situation like you're also a teenager because you had kids too young  and never had a change to emotionally devolp past that mentality. But 44 (your age) - 16 (age of daughter) - 1 (plus about a year for pregnancy, rounded up) = 27. For a lot of people that's still too young, but like. For the math I was expecting to work, you'd have to be 34 right now.\n\nI don't mean to rag on you too much, daddy-o. Single fatherhood's got to be hard. That said, I think you really should consider taking better care of yourself. Maybe try therapy and/or a career change? Take a vacation? Day spay? Change in diet in exercise regimen? Assuming you can afford any of those things - money is fucking tough sometimes. My point is that the way you seem to treat your daughter in this post really makes is seem like you're having trouble extending empathy to her because you're too wrapped up in yourself, possibly because you're not very content or cared for. \n\nUnfortunately your daughters aren't people who can take care of you right now. If you do good by them, they'll probably take care of you when they're both real adults and your body starts failing, but right now unfortunately you have to take care of yourself. So, my advice: Apologize to your damn daughter, make sure she has something to eat, and after that sit down and take a good think on what you want out of life that you can get, or at least get closer to. Like, I want 5 million dollars and a perfect body, but neither of those are ever going to happen for me. However, in the past few years I've lost about 20 pounds and saved up a couple thousand dollars, you know? It ain't much, but just that I've made progress on it makes me a lot happier and able to extend kindness to others.\n\nBut back to your daughter - She really needs her daddy right now. Like, being 16 fucking sucks regardless of you're gender, but also consider that \\*you\\* probably \\*wouldn't\\* understand some of the problems a 16 year old girl might face. That's not your fault, you're a dude, you know? But getting all pissy at your daughter and withholding food from her really kind of confirms and drives home that not only would you not understand whatever problem she's facing, but that you really have no interest in trying to understand either. Really did not make yourself someone she can rely on with your behavior at all. In the very least, if you can't make her life easier, try not to make it worse. I think you'll find that if you stick to doing that for a few months, your daughter will start repaying the favor.\n\nGood luck.", "YTA.", "YTA. Your behavior is sickening towards your child.

I can tell you for sure, I wasn't talking about any of that stuff with my family and definitely not my dad. And them saying \"are you mad?\" Or \"cheer up, you're ruing xyz\" was a cheat code to an angry teenage girl, on top of whatever else was happening in my head. She's gonna have lots of big feelings, and that's healthy. Forcing only positive feelings, especially in her own home, which SHOULD be a safe space, is NOT healthy.

This is a real world thing- if you're not in a good state to be around people, you actually don't have to be (especially in your own home/ safe space)\n3) just ignore the snide remarks and continue to be stable and kind. Aka turn the other cheek. She'll likely cool down in a bit and be embarrassed enough inside her own head. This also works on people at work or school. Bonus, you're modeling that you don't have to let someone else's words hurt you. Also, saying mean things to get a reaction doesn't work.\n\nWhat your punishments are teaching her is not \"use nice words\", it's \"those emotions are bad.\" Focus on how to recognize and manage those emotions.

Is there an undiagnosed mental health crisis that cuts deep?\n\nIf you feel that your rapport with her isn't what she needs right now, consider getting her into therapy.

Two, this is where gentle/responsive parenting may be helpful because it\u2019s about creating the sense of choice and autonomy in the constricts of the lack of autonomy (no candy for dinner, but she can have a piece alongside dinner or here are her options in Roblox etc). A big thing with kids to remember is that they have very little sense of emotional regulation, and we as adults tend to try to hold them to adult standards that adults don\u2019t even do (your comment on everyone has a bad day including me but that doesn\u2019t mean we get to make people around us suffer as much as we are).

Important to remember that negative attention is always better than no attention, and sending her away can unintentionally reinforce that. Can you spend 5 minutes doing a check in on how her mood is before dinner? You tolerating her big feelings is a part of your job as parent, so witnessing them and honoring the feeling without the request is really important.

If she did, it still would not make her behavior okay, but it would make it understandable, just to be clear.\n\nImo, you are letting her misbehavior go on far too long. When she begins to complain or says something rude, calmly remind her that \"we do not speak rudely like that in this house. If you do it again, you will have to go to your room until you are ready to be polite.\"\n\n**And then you follow through.**\n\nHer behavior may escalate at first, but it should taper off quickly once she realizes that you are actually serious and there will be consequences for her actions and words.

Two suggestions for you. \n\nNumber one: in my house, the rule is either you eat what's for dinner, or you make your own (which includes cleaning up after yourself). My kids don't want what I've made? Then they can make themselves a PB&J, or a quesadilla, or whatever else is in their skill range.\n\nNumber two: if she complains about meals a lot, then consider having her help with meal planning and prep.\n\nHonestly, if your daughter isn't getting in trouble for similar behavior at school, then she's acting out because she's learned she can get away with it at home. If she can control herself at school, then she can do it at home.\n\nTo summarize: You need to set out clear rules and boundaries *before* bad behavior starts. Lay out what the consequences will be for either kid breaking the rules. If they break a minor rule, I typically give one reminder of the rule and consequences. If it was serious misbehavior, like hurting someone, then no reminders, straight to consequences. Stay calm and don't yell when enforcing rules and consequences, because some kids thrive off the negative attention. And then stick with the rules. Be firm and consistent.

I NEVER raised my family to talk inappropriately", "Trust me a quick read of these comments has thoroughly convinced me there are plenty of mentally unhealthy people to be found...", "You're actually wasting your time these people are terminally online. I'm speaking from experience in that last 30 min its really not worth it.", "Can you define withholding food? Is refusing a snack withholding food? I feel like when you say \"withholding food\" you are trying to bring the weight of someone starving a child. If you're asking me if a parent makes their child go to bed without dinner after offering it and asking what was wrong twice only to get frustrated and over-react to a child (which they shouldn't) once a month is abuse I would say no. I would say its ineffective counterproductive parenting I would even say its a shitty thing to do. However no I wouldn't call it abuse. In any case that isn't what happened here. I think OP is probably a good parent broadly speaking. Any parent who questions their judgements and tries to get more perspective and do better for their kid has all the fundamentals to become a very capable parent. Finally yes for neglect to rise to the level of abuse it does require a pattern of behavior over time. EX: if you don't clean your house for a week its negligent If you let your children live in filth its abusive negligence.", "If you define abuse in such a way that depriving your child of a basic need isn't abuse, I don't know what to say to you. And just because a lot of parents do it doesn't make it okay. A lot of parents hit their kids, too.\n\nAlso where are you getting that stat from?", "Lol I literally said it was bad parenting elsewhere but whatever floats your boat. Parents who make mistakes and second guess themselves and try to be better next time like OP is right now are far from \"terrible parents abusing their kid by starving them\" just because I'm not hyperbolic in condemning OP does not mean I agree with him. I hate that I live in a world where I can say \"missing one meal isn't child starvation\" and in response I get conspiracy brains like you saying \"yOu MuSt bE oP iN DisGuiSe!!!\".", "Again, all that tells us is that you were raised a certain way. It doesn't reflect at all on anyone else.", "I agree that the original commenter took it a step too far fs (there really just isn\u2019t enough information to broadly label OP as anything, good or bad), but this is a form of abuse. Withholding food is abuse, or any basic necessity really. I don\u2019t agree with the daughters treatment of her family at all but there\u2019s clearly more going on here and dad needs to address it instead of sweeping it under the rug and labeling his own daughter as bad. Should step up and act like a fucking parent instead of getting down on his daughters level and acting childish and, yea, abusive, by tossing out her dinner wtf. Imagine if some adult walked up to you and threw your plate away bc your \u201cmood wasn\u2019t acceptable\u201d and you made some comments about what was served. You would be pissed, rightfully so. I\u2019m sure OP can make up for this in some way or another, perhaps by helping his daughter instead of outcasting her (which he implied imo that is his intent with his 4th edit)", "I\u2019m shocked that these comments are all reading YTA. For me, it\u2019s clear NTA. I\u2019m only 27 but when I was growing up, I could never act unruly like this without consequences. Nowadays everyone thinks that said consequences are \u201cabuse\u201d lmao. I\u2019m wondering if there is a correlation between this attitude and why the younger generations are so maladjusted.", "You have a different idea of abuse. He threw her dinner in the garbage and refused her a bowl of cereal and milk because she wasn't in a good enough mood for him. That is categorically abusive. She needs to talk to a teacher or counselor \n\nShe's entitled to her emotions whether he agrees with or understands them.", "in what world is sending a child to bed without dinner not withholding food?", "I said \"starving\". As in the act of starving someone. His sole purpose for taking her food was to make her suffer for hurting his feelings. The following is a definition from Oxford. Emphasis on the \"or\".\n Starving. /\u02c8st\u0251\u02d0v\u026a\u014b/ /\u02c8st\u0251\u02d0rv\u026a\u014b/ Idioms Phrasal Verbs.

It reflects on how your parents talked around you and the type of environment you were raised in", "Refusing a snack is withholding food but it isn't abuse. For withholding food to rise to the level of abuse it has to be a pattern of behavior which it isn't here hence not abusive. If he followed through on what he said then it would be but he was clear he was just making a point. I swear reddit it a race to see who can be the most hyperbolic to get the most attention.", "That would really be impacted by how you are trying to define maladjusted. Things that intentionally or negligently cause physical emotional and psychological harm to children is abuse. That\u2019s the legal definition. Just because we have done something historically doesn\u2019t make it not abuse, it just means that abuse was acceptable. You are giving off the vibes of the \u201cmy parents hit me and I turned out fine\u201d crowd\u2026who did not turn out fine. And we have decades of research to prove it.", "It is withholding food the actual interesting question is when does withholding food become abuse. When people say withholding food they are frequently trying to imply much more than missing one meal by loading their language. It is entirely misleading. As to the answer to the question I'm not sure where that line is exactly but refusing a snack is also withholding food but it isn't abuse. I also don't think one meal is ground for abuse. Maybe 2 in a row maybe one meal for multiple days not sure its hard to say tbh.  Honestly if anything was abusive it would be the threat of future deprivation not the actual food withheld but even that seems a stretch unless the threat was credible which we would need more info to establish. However, I don't think you wanted a real answer. I think this is just grandstanding.", "If you think suffering is skipping a single meal you must have lead the most blessed, life I truly envy you. Stay gold Ponyboy stay gold.", "Right. Whether you were raised in a strict, traditionalist, and out-of-date authoritarian family, or a modern, supportive, and caring family.", "It's been found that frequent use of cussing is correlated with higher intelligence.\n\nAnecdotally, when tested as a child, my IQ was 170 something.\n\nI fucking cuss like a sailor on leave who lost his pay in a whorehouse.\n\nShockingly, I'm also aware of when cussing might not be appropriate, because my parents taught me that, not to censor perfectly cromulent and effective words because of dainty ladies like you.", "He refused her dinner and cereal that she would have made herself, on top of threatening to not feed her in the future. That\u2019s more than a snack, use your brain.", "There is a vast difference between being hit and being disciplined. Nowadays being disciplined is abusive, especially by your \u201cdefinition\u201d. Sending someone to bed without dinner when they\u2019re talking crazy is so far from abusive, I don\u2019t know how you can equate them. Then again, this is Reddit so I shouldn\u2019t be surprised.", "and i think you need a hobby other than defending a shitty dad on the internet but i suppose we're at an impasse there \ud83e\udd37\n\nedit to say you literally asked about how one would define withholding food. i was addressing your question", "It's really weird how badly you want it to be okay to not feed kids. Get better \"pony\" or whatever", "yes it is more than a snack very good, now use your brain you're arbitrarily drawing lines that excludes a snack and encompasses a meal.  I don't think refusing one meal or one snack constitutes abuse. Certainly their is some point at which it would become abuse if dinner were routinely refused as a control mechanism or several meals were missed consecutively but a one off like this no way. The threat is a separate issue which if credible (I don't believe it was but without more info we'd both just be speculating) then it could have the potential to be abusive but again not what I was talking about.", "As someone required to take my state\u2019s child abuse training every two years, I\u2019m gonna have to disagree with this idea that this is my \u201cdefinition\u201d. Intentional physical harm is abuse, whether it\u2019s controlled or uncontrolled, because they get hurt, and you are teaching one of two things: fear, because my loved ones will hurt me, or that hitting is an acceptable behavior, which is why research continually shows more violence in people who were hit as kids. Again, decades of research show that it does not improve anything for kids and doesn\u2019t meet the goals described, because fear and respect are vastly different things. Sending a kid to bed without *access* to dinner constitutes as abuse which is different than here\u2019s the food, take it or leave it and they choose not to eat. On the much bigger front though, he threatened full removal of access, and that is psychological harm. It doesn\u2019t matter that he claims now he wasn\u2019t serious, because she didn\u2019t know that. Food is on your foundational level of maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs and you cannot threaten things on there for minors you are legally responsible for.", "Wow you're actually right I shouldn't have made a literary reference (Ponyboy) its pretty obvious you've never read a book lmao Imagine someone saying not feeding your kids a single meal is the same as not feeding them in general. I'm actually not mature enough to take you're nonsense seriously anymore bye bye."]}
