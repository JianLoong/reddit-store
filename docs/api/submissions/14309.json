We\u2019re a very affectionate family. Kate isn\u2019t, she comes from a family where hugs weren\u2019t that common and as such she sees affection to the level of ours as highly unusual, maybe even weird. She expresses her discomfort with our affection on occasion, but I tell her I don\u2019t apologize for loving my daughters. \n\nMeg and I developed a relationship. She saw us being affectionate to each other and she wondered if I liked her as much as her step sisters. I told her if she wanted to id do the same things with her, she said yes so I did. We started cuddling, hugging and all that I did with my other daughters.\n One day Kate saw us cuddling on the couch, and she didn\u2019t like it, she said that I could do whatever I wanted with my daughters, but not to do it with hers. So I stopped, and when Meg wanted to cuddle I had to politely let her down. I told her that her mom told me I couldn\u2019t anymore so to blame her.\n\nBefore anyone says it, Kate is a a great mom. Meg is well taken care of and shown tons of love, just not much physical affection.\n\nAnyway, Meg blamed Kate for me not \u201cloving her\u201d anymore, and Kate got extremely mad at me. She said hugging my kids as much as I do was really weird. I got pissed and I told her that it wasn\u2019t my fault that her parents didn\u2019t love her. She was really taken aback by that and she hasn\u2019t talked to me since, this was two days ago.\n\nLike I said I\u2019m not apologizing for being affectionate with my kids.

It sounds like Meg would also like Kate to be more affectionate.", "ESH. Your wife shouldn't have stopped you from being affectionate with your step daughter (especially since she now sees you treating her step sisters differently). It's not weird to show physical affection to your children (even step children). That said, you went nuclear. Not all families show affection the same way, and just because her family wasn't into physical affection, doesn't mean that they don't love her.\n\nEdit: I do want to clarify she does have the right to ask you to stop being physically affectionate with her child. That said, she shouldn't have implied that it's weird. It's not.", "ESH. Your wife sucks for trying to dictate how you show affection and for sabotaging your relationship with Meg. She should allow Meg to make her own decisions about her relationships. You suck for telling her she was unloved. Her family may have showed love differently. You also shouldn\u2019t be blaming your wife. You and Kate need to discuss this between you but having Meg caught in the middle isn\u2019t fair.", "ESH - (Apart from the kids).\n\nYes Kate has been deprived of affection from her parents and this is having a negative impact on her daughter, given her reaction to having had it and it being withdrawn.\n\nTo suggest that there was something improper about you hugging your daughters is a really awful thing to say.\n\nBut so is saying her parents didn\u2019t love her. I know it just slipped out and get how, it might even be true, but I think maybe having a discussion about expressing affection is needed here when you are not having an altercation. Weaving doubt into her mind about her upbringing is kinda cruel.\n\nI would suggest that maybe couple counselling therapy might help.I did couple\u2019s therapy - I grew up in an n abusive household but had not really realised that a lot of the things that happened/didn\u2019t happen were unusual and unhealthy/abusive. (I\u2019m not saying anyone else\u2019s parents are abusive, I\u2019m just giving context as to WHY we were in therapy when our relationship was fine!)\n\nTalking through family relationships with both my partner and the therapist was like a light being turned on and it felt somehow safer with there being three people rather than two.\n\nAlso, it just helped us understand that we\u2019re just different and express things differently. Like you and Kate do. \n\nI hope you get it sorted out. No one here sounds like a bad person, you both could have reacted better in this situation is all.", "ESH. Neither of you appreciate your differences and Meg got caught in the crossfire.", "This is a tough one. I'm ngl, the comment about her parents not loving her was probably too far so maybe you're the AH for your specific choice of words, but I don't think you're the AH for reacting out of frustration. It seems like she's trying to frame physical affection with your daughters as some creepy, perverted thing when it's not. I can see why she might feel uncomfortable when it concerns her own daughter, but overall it seems like she's perceiving physical affection between family members the wrong way. Maybe this does have something to do with the way her parents raised her, and maybe it doesn't. Either way it was a low blow that I would probably apologize for (without necessarily apologizing for showing your daughters love and affection).", "ESH  You said yourself that Kate is a great mom who loves her daughter, just doesn't show much physical affection. So why does her own parents not showing her the same affection mean they didn't love her. You seen to understand that these behaviors are learned, but decided to be needlessly cruel. \n\nBut she's also an A H because she should have talked to you before being so reactionary. And talked to Meg about her needs separately at an age-appropriate level. I feel for Kate. I'm also a single mother of a similarly-aged daughter. The drive to protect can be overwhelming. I'm not saying she handled this well, but I can see why she may have gotten uncomfortable. The deep-seeded discomfort around physical touch doesn't just disappear.", "NTA. Been married for 3 years. This is something that should\u2019ve been addressed a long time ago. Hard to believe dad just started doing out of the blue. Being affectionate is not a bad thing and will make this young girl more willing to be affectionate with her own family some day. Further more it puts a wall between the the 2 blended families. Seems like they\u2019re not fully committed to each other. Op I don\u2019t think your off in your assessment of your spouse. It\u2019s hard truth. Personally I don\u2019t think Reddit is going to help the situation but I\u2019d consider some martial counseling.

You have to understand that not everyone is comfortable with that type of physical affection. Not everyone is the same as you are. While I don't think it was very nice of your new wife to question this behavior, you definitely shouldn't have retaliated by blaming it all on your stepdaughters mother. Telling her that her parents didn't love her is a serious low blow", "YTA.

I was at my friend\u2019s house when I was like, 13-14 maybe? Her mom went to say goodnight to us and she gave my friend a peck on the lips. I was raised in a super affectionate family but that was weird to me. I asked my mom when I got home about that and she said that a lot of parents do that so I was just like, well ok then and moved on. It\u2019s weird that your wife is almost sexualizing your relationship with your daughters - appropriate physical touch is really great for mental health in kids and adults and many kids really crave it. But you crossed a major line when you said hey parents didn\u2019t love her. My in-laws are not physically affectionate at all but are still very loving. Nothing wrong with that. You two might benefit from a few counseling sessions to iron this out", "Yes YTA. Some people are not demonstrative, it doesn't mean they don't love their family\n I love my husband and children but I hate being hugged and having people hang all over me. It doesn't make me a bad wife, mother, sister or daughter. My family and friends know I love them and I have their backs no matter what.", "NTA but you should apologize for snapping.

This doesn\u2019t automatically mean that they don\u2019t love their child/family member. \n\nTelling your wife this when you violated a boundary she put in place and deliberately attempted to damage her relationship with her child is out of line and fucking cruel. \n\nGrow up, OP, or you\u2019ll have a second ex-wife.", "YTA.   \n\nThere are plenty of loving parents who don\u2019t hug/ kiss/ cuddle their kids every day. \n\nI grew up in a cuddly/hugging/ saying I love you 5x a day to each other kind of house.

It *is* weird and disturbing for you to be suddenly hugging and cuddling her like that with no context. Your wife was being protective. Instead of trying to understand where she was coming from, you first intentionally put a wedge in between her and Meg. Then when she (rightfully) became upset, you came out of left field about her parents not loving her. There not being a ton of physical affection in the house doesn't mean her parents didn't love her. What you actually should have done after she brought it up the first time was tell your wife what Meg said that led to you to start hugging and cuddling her. There was absolutely no reason to become so passive aggressive and combative.", "Yes YTA. You crossed a line. Not everyone shows love the same as others. Her parents love her just as much as your parents love you. Just some prefer to show it through actions and not words or being affectionate like that. My Dad and his family aren't affectionate and we don't really say I love you much but we all know we are cared for through actions and how we treat each other. My mom and her family are like you and your daughters. Saying I love you every 5 minutes, hugging for 10-15 minutes at a time and can't back away until they do first, lots of kissing, etc and they honestly don't mean any of it. It's all for show. I'd rather be in a family who shows love through actions instead of a competition between affectionate but that's just me and my experience with it. To each their own but it doesn't impact her relationship with her parents. That was too far.", "YTA. You crossed a line both when telling Kate her parents didn't love her, and also with cuddling with Meg without explaining to Kate what you were doing and why. Kate's parents loved her, they just showed affection differently and had boundaries that were respected. Not every family and not every person wants physical affection as a demonstration of love. Meg may have been feeling left out, but you should've talked to Kate and explained what Meg said to you, then allowed her to decide how to address it.", "YTA.   \n\n\nThere is absolutely nothing my mom wouldn't do for me, but we were not a touchy-feely family. Different people express familial love differently.", "YTA, holy crap. She said it was weird to her, and you responded with, \"Your parents didn't love you!\"???", "Yta. You dont really believe her parents did not love her just because they weren't outwardly affectionate? BTW enjoy the cuddles with your daughters. At there ages they cuddles will be ending soon.", "YTA. You literally told her to blame her mom, driving a wedge between a young girl and her mother. You then decided her parents never loved her because they showed it differently. Your wife is also TA, though, because physical affection is important, and while I understand her protectiveness, Meg is being deprived of it, which has consequences. Especially if it's a love language of hers, which it sounds like it is.", "Info I would recommend getting a divorce lawyer", "YTA. While I think your wife is wrong, every family shows affection differently. Telling her her own family doesn't love her is toxic, abusive and will trash her self esteem.  There was a better way to broach this subject and you chose cruelty.", "yes, of course YTA. How is this even a question?", "YTA", "YTA and honestly, I agree more with your wife then with you. Either way, everyone shows love in a different way. You can't say what you said. You should apologise ASAP. Also ask your wife why she doesn't want you to do it with her daughter.

Honestly, the extra hugging etc.  makes my skin itch.

Your  stepdaughter felt being treated same way by you as your own daughters was inconclusive. And if your wife has suspicions, well that is a whole different kettle of fish and she shouldn't be with you.\n\nBut it was taking the low road to say her parents didn't love her.

You even admitted that Kate is a great mom so unless you have another reason you think her parents didn\u2019t love her, it\u2019s not even true by your logic.

I loved hugging and kissing my dad, and on certain days I miss that. Let it be known there was nothing weird about it. As for your wife, it's sad that she can't embrace this because the one who misses out is her daughter.  Meg must watch your daughters with a certain amount of envy.  But I do agree YTA for saying your wife's parents didn't love her, that was unfair because they may have different standards just like how multiple cultures do things differently. It doesn't make them less capable of showing love it just means they show it differently.
