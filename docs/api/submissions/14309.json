We started cuddling, hugging and all that I did with my other daughters.\n One day Kate saw us cuddling on the couch, and she didn\u2019t like it, she said that I could do whatever I wanted with my daughters, but not to do it with hers.

Your wife shouldn't have stopped you from being affectionate with your step daughter (especially since she now sees you treating her step sisters differently). It's not weird to show physical affection to your children (even step children). That said, you went nuclear. Not all families show affection the same way, and just because her family wasn't into physical affection, doesn't mean that they don't love her.\n\nEdit: I do want to clarify she does have the right to ask you to stop being physically affectionate with her child.

You and Kate need to discuss this between you but having Meg caught in the middle isn\u2019t fair.", "ESH - (Apart from the kids).\n\nYes Kate has been deprived of affection from her parents and this is having a negative impact on her daughter, given her reaction to having had it and it being withdrawn.\n\nTo suggest that there was something improper about you hugging your daughters is a really awful thing to say.\n\nBut so is saying her parents didn\u2019t love her. I know it just slipped out and get how, it might even be true, but I think maybe having a discussion about expressing affection is needed here when you are not having an altercation. Weaving doubt into her mind about her upbringing is kinda cruel.\n\nI would suggest that maybe couple counselling therapy might help.I did couple\u2019s therapy - I grew up in an n abusive household but had not really realised that a lot of the things that happened/didn\u2019t happen were unusual and unhealthy/abusive.

Neither of you appreciate your differences and Meg got caught in the crossfire.", "This is a tough one. I'm ngl, the comment about her parents not loving her was probably too far so maybe you're the AH for your specific choice of words, but I don't think you're the AH for reacting out of frustration. It seems like she's trying to frame physical affection with your daughters as some creepy, perverted thing when it's not. I can see why she might feel uncomfortable when it concerns her own daughter, but overall it seems like she's perceiving physical affection between family members the wrong way. Maybe this does have something to do with the way her parents raised her, and maybe it doesn't. Either way it was a low blow that I would probably apologize for (without necessarily apologizing for showing your daughters love and affection).", "ESH  You said yourself that Kate is a great mom who loves her daughter, just doesn't show much physical affection. So why does her own parents not showing her the same affection mean they didn't love her. You seen to understand that these behaviors are learned, but decided to be needlessly cruel. \n\nBut she's also an A H because she should have talked to you before being so reactionary. And talked to Meg about her needs separately at an age-appropriate level. I feel for Kate. I'm also a single mother of a similarly-aged daughter. The drive to protect can be overwhelming. I'm not saying she handled this well, but I can see why she may have gotten uncomfortable. The deep-seeded discomfort around physical touch doesn't just disappear.", "NTA. Been married for 3 years. This is something that should\u2019ve been addressed a long time ago. Hard to believe dad just started doing out of the blue. Being affectionate is not a bad thing and will make this young girl more willing to be affectionate with her own family some day. Further more it puts a wall between the the 2 blended families.

You have to understand that not everyone is comfortable with that type of physical affection. Not everyone is the same as you are.

I asked my mom when I got home about that and she said that a lot of parents do that so I was just like, well ok then and moved on. It\u2019s weird that your wife is almost sexualizing your relationship with your daughters - appropriate physical touch is really great for mental health in kids and adults and many kids really crave it.

It *is* weird and disturbing for you to be suddenly hugging and cuddling her like that with no context. Your wife was being protective. Instead of trying to understand where she was coming from, you first intentionally put a wedge in between her and Meg. Then when she (rightfully) became upset, you came out of left field about her parents not loving her. There not being a ton of physical affection in the house doesn't mean her parents didn't love her. What you actually should have done after she brought it up the first time was tell your wife what Meg said that led to you to start hugging and cuddling her. There was absolutely no reason to become so passive aggressive and combative.", "Yes YTA. You crossed a line. Not everyone shows love the same as others. Her parents love her just as much as your parents love you. Just some prefer to show it through actions and not words or being affectionate like that. My Dad and his family aren't affectionate and we don't really say I love you much but we all know we are cared for through actions and how we treat each other. My mom and her family are like you and your daughters. Saying I love you every 5 minutes, hugging for 10-15 minutes at a time and can't back away until they do first, lots of kissing, etc and they honestly don't mean any of it. It's all for show. I'd rather be in a family who shows love through actions instead of a competition between affectionate but that's just me and my experience with it. To each their own but it doesn't impact her relationship with her parents. That was too far.", "YTA. You crossed a line both when telling Kate her parents didn't love her, and also with cuddling with Meg without explaining to Kate what you were doing and why. Kate's parents loved her, they just showed affection differently and had boundaries that were respected. Not every family and not every person wants physical affection as a demonstration of love. Meg may have been feeling left out, but you should've talked to Kate and explained what Meg said to you, then allowed her to decide how to address it.", "YTA.   \n\n\nThere is absolutely nothing my mom wouldn't do for me, but we were not a touchy-feely family.

You dont really believe her parents did not love her just because they weren't outwardly affectionate? BTW enjoy the cuddles with your daughters. At there ages they cuddles will be ending soon.", "YTA. You literally told her to blame her mom, driving a wedge between a young girl and her mother. You then decided her parents never loved her because they showed it differently. Your wife is also TA, though, because physical affection is important, and while I understand her protectiveness, Meg is being deprived of it, which has consequences. Especially if it's a love language of hers, which it sounds like it is.", "Info I would recommend getting a divorce lawyer", "YTA. While I think your wife is wrong, every family shows affection differently. Telling her her own family doesn't love her is toxic, abusive and will trash her self esteem.

But I do agree YTA for saying your wife's parents didn't love her, that was unfair because they may have different standards just like how multiple cultures do things differently.

So it is not unreasonable that people can come from that type of background and the parents still love their kids.  I also know it's healthy and appropriate to be physically affectionate to your loved ones.  Calling out your wife like that won't help.

You both need to come together on this and it sounds like the two of you need to work on your communication.  This is common as healthy communication tends to be different for each couple.

There are people who don't like to touch others a lot or to be touched by others a lot, not even family members, but they can still love them, and those people are not broken or less for having different preferences.\n\nWife should have handled better the situation and should have a talk with OP and her daughter about what her daughter wants, see if there's a solution that works for everyone, everyone is comfortable with and have a talk with her daughter about different ways of affection, that she is loved even if she is not constantly showed physical affection by everyone. ESH", "I don't think it's fair to say he's TA when she's shaming him & his daughters for having a different love language as well. He never should have said that to his wife, but she also shouldn't be attempting to make him & his daughters feel weird about theirs. ESH.", "Yes, they definitely need to read The Five Love Languages. And understand that while no affection might not have hurt Kate, Meg is being deprived of a very basic need and may not feel loved at all right now. Some people can't go through life without snuggles and growing up that way is extremely traumatic.", "She does actually. Meg is the wife's child, not OP's. There's no mention of adoption, and it seems likely that no adoption occurred given that OP refers to his daughters as step sisters. She DOES have the right to make decisions about what happens to her daughter. Do I agree with her decision? No. But she does have that right.", "Thank you.  I do see, appreciate and even enjoy physical contact with other adults occasionally.  It just feels awkward.  Have you ever seen the show the Good Doctor?

The thought came from somewhere", "True. If I were OP I'd say I understand you're not comfortable with lots of physical affection between parents and kids, can we ask Meg what she is comfortable with?\n\nI know Meg has been clear she wants affection but this question underlines the point that it should be MEG deciding what amount of physical affection SHE is comfortable with.

Her family showed love in a different way. She can explain it better if you want.\nIt doesn't mean I love you any less\"\n\nThat would have been better.

Are we just skipping that entirely?", "A 7 year old would ask what inappropriate means.", "Based on the OP, it may be creepy.", "I was very affectionate with my kids from birth to...well, they're grown now, but I still am. However, it's important to note this is also cultural. In the time and culture in which my mom grew up, babies were hugged and cuddled a lot, but older children were not. Mom said she felt very secure and very loved because her mother showed affection in many other ways. And Mom was affectionate with us kids, but it was deliberate and learned on her part. (And she was a wonderful mom. I miss her daily.)\n\nIt's true that babies need lots of cuddling and physical affection, but there are MANY cultures/countries where babies are cuddled, but children and adults are shown love in ways other than physical affection. It's not abusive, and those kids don't grow up damaged unless they have violent or negligent parents. It's merely a cultural norm. \n\nI agree that solitary confinement is pretty horrific, but that's because of the lack of human interaction, not the lack of physical affection.

Kate\u2019s daughter then comes to him wanting to experience the kind of affection OP is aware his wife finds discomfiting. He decides not to discuss the request from Kate\u2019s daughter with his wife - the actual parent of Meg, and negotiate what boundaries she might feel comfortable with before engaging physically with Kate\u2019s daughter in a manner he was aware made her uncomfortable. \n\nWhen she told him that she was not comfortable with this level of physical affection being directed to her daughter and asked him to stop, he relayed this to Meg in a way that suggests her mother doesn\u2019t want her to feel loved or equal, and explicitly directed Kate\u2019s daughter to blame Kate for this. \n\nHe then tells Kate that because she was upset at her clear boundaries being stomped all over, and then being set up as the mean, wicked witch stopping Meg from being loved, her own parents didn\u2019t love her.

Sometimes people go for the jugular when they feel defensive, even though they don't actually think those things at all. He's a jerk here because he said something he knew would hurt his partner the most.\n\nThe way he speaks of his wife generally suggests he doesn't actually think that way, he was just lashing out because he felt accused of something inappropriate.\n\nAs an example, my brother once told me I was driving our parent into an early grave because of my disability. He doesn't actually think that, he said it because he knew it was what would hurt me the most in the moment. He apologized later because obviously it was a horrible thing to say and he *didn't* think it was the truth at all.", "I think that it's odd that y'all aren't wondering why the wife is so adamant that OP is the weird one.

Anger and frustration", "That\u2019s what I always think when people say that the OP was nice or tactful or respectful or kind enough.
