People drown in pool even if they can touch the ground.\n\nI know it because it almost happened to me. I was just next to the stairs. I could touch the ground. But I slipped and swallowed water. And I panicked. I was 10. I wasn't able to think and I was just panicking. My Aunt was watching and immediately knew I needed help. If not, I would 100% have drown.\n\nUninformed people like that are why so many child die from drowning.", "Yeah. That doesn't make sense. So the kids are also exposed to second hand smoke indoors. So many problems here. Mil is not a responsible babysitter.", "Which would be even worse if grandma was getting high with kids alone in a pool. What could possibly go wrong?", "Not weed. But she doesn\u2019t want her cigarettes getting wet. And also sometimes it\u2019s hot outside so she can cool off inside while she smokes", "When I was growing up, my family used to camp alongside a river every summer. One year, us kids were all swimming in a familiar area, and suddenly there was this massive drop-off that wasn't there before, I assume on account of the riverbed shifting throughout the previous year. Nobody could touch bottom, including the older kids, and the current chose that moment to get hella stronger on account of a passing cargo ship. So we're suddenly getting dragged further and further out at gathering speed, there's nothing to grab onto, and the teens in the group had to scoop up the younger kids (who, thankfully, were at least all wearing life jackets) and just swim like hell. At the time it felt fun-scary, but as an adult I'm like, holy shit, that could have ended so much worse. If we hadn't had flotation devices, if the older kids weren't such experienced swimmers, if we'd been just a little bit further from shore, so many variables that all could have led to a very different outcome.\n\nA backyard pool is safer than a river for obvious reasons, but removing the most obvious life-preserving variable &mdash; adult supervision &mdash; from the equation is just asking for trouble.", "And kids playing around in the pool having fun splashing each other might not even notice when grandma goes inside.  She could be in there for 10-15 minutes before one of them realizes she's gone.", "That is exactly the problem, and \u201ctragic\u201d is the word. I mean, in my friend\u2019s case it\u2019s inspiring they\u2019ve made a business trying to keep kids safe from this one danger, but it\u2019s a drop in the bucket. Understandably, my friend has a lot to say about it whenever it comes up (often enough, given his work).", "Ok, so when do you feel like they'll be ready? A guestimate. One year? Five years?", "Not do I. But I want to know when op thinks it's fine. And when does op think the kids can swim on their own.", "Your husband should be managing his mother.

Yta for that.  Nta for wanting your kids supervised in the pool though.", "There is nothing nice I can say about your MIL. You are NTA but she is! I cannot believe that is her reasoning. What a nut! Keep your kids safe! You never know what could happen in the pool when someone isn't watching!", "Umm. I'm not sure but generally how the pools work is that when the weather is hot, you get inside the pool to cool off - does your MIL's pool work differently? \n\nShe needn't smoke, she can simply get into the pool to cool off. But then again her cigarettes are more important to her than the literal life and well-being of her grandchildren. I would take this much further than the issue of supervision around pool time.

Asking for kids to be supervised in a pool is not having high standards. It's fucking basic safety.  \nApproximatively 900 child die every year in the USA by unintentional drowning. That is 900 lives that didn't need to end and that easily could have been saved by adult supervision. 900 family grieving a year, that could have been easily prevented. That's a LOT.", "If she is unwilling to do it, she should of said so.

And it is not unreasonable to ask for supervision in a pool from an adult, who is more capable of saving a child if they WERE to drown.\n\nThe 11 year old may find it a bit more difficult to get their 4 year old sibling out from a dangerous situation than an adult would.", "She doesn\u2019t want her cigarettes wet", "Seems reasonable.
