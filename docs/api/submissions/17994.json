Keep in mind that the pool had only one level, and they were too short to touch the ground (the oldest one could barely touch it if she stretched her leg enough). Anyway, their mother was like \"you can focus on the little one,  they can swim, and you can also leave them alone in the pool, I trust them.\" (With \"leaving them alone\"she meant that I could phsically walk away from the pool, not watching them at al). The oldest was fine, the middle one on the other end, was not as confident as his mother believed, he would get tired pretty quick, and he would alwayd swim around the ladder, so that he could grab it and use it as an emergency floatie, or he would swim near me, asking me to grab him.

I guess I don't know what you're getting at, here, so apologies if I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlso, the same study showed kids 14 and older are more likely to drown in bodies of water.

I suspect that some people think pools are a small, contained areas and that they don\u2019t have to watch the younger ones as closely as they do at a lake or ocean. I think many people also believe that drowning is like in Hollywood, lots of splashing and screaming, when in fact it\u2019s quite silent, so they assume they\u2019ll notice a kid who\u2019s in trouble almost right away and be able to help. At a lake or ocean you definitely could be far away, but in a pool it might just be a couple of steps.
