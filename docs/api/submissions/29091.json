I\u2019m talking double shifts, overtime, working 7 days a week, hardly sleeping - just working all the time. So as a result, I only saw him approximately 3 times in the past 4 months - and each time we DIDN\u2019T do anything because he was super tired.\n\nAnyway, he came over last night to see me and berated me for eating cookies on my bed saying that I\u2019m messy so I\u2019ll leave crumbs for ants for bite him while he sleeps. I responded by just staring blankly at him for a couple seconds. \n\nHe said \u201coh, I forgot you\u2019re on your period.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cwhat? I\u2019m not on my period.\u201d \n\nHe looked confused and pulled out his phone. He said according to his PERIOD TRACKER - which mind you, I didn\u2019t know he had - I was supposed to start my period since the 13th and by me not being on my period, it means I\u2019m really late.\n\nI told him that I\u2019ve been stressed with work and home life lately so maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s not here yet.\n\nHe said \u201cor maybe you\u2019ve been having fun with other people while I\u2019ve been working hard for us.\u201d\n\nAt this point I\u2019m offended and upset. \n\nHe then demands that I take a pregnancy test. I told him that I don\u2019t just have pregnancy tests lying around. \n\nHe said \u201cokay\u201d and left. \n\nI try calling him - no answer.\n\nHe comes back 10 minutes later with a pregnancy test from the pharmacy up the street. \n\nI was appalled. My jaw is still on the floor.\n\nI told him that I am not pregnant because I haven\u2019t done anything to get pregnant and I\u2019m not taking a pregnancy test and that if he doesn\u2019t trust me, when I\u2019ve done nothing wrong, then he needs to figure out why. \n\nHe said If I can\u2019t take a pregnancy test that just proves that I have something to hide. \n\nI asked him politely to leave and he did. \n\nI thought that was the end of it but this morning I woke up to a bunch of messages from him, his best friend and his sister - all calling me horrible names for \u201ccheating on him.\u201d In one of the messages he calls me an AH for not taking the test to \u201cplease his mind.\u201d\n\nI haven\u2019t responded yet because it\u2019s 6:38am and I don\u2019t know what to say. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697539163, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179vdzj/aita_for_refusing_to_take_a_pregnancy_test_my/", "score": 1098, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, I would have kicked him straight out when I found out that he had an app like that because it's a massive violation. What the hell does he use it for? Even if a partner of mine used it so he knew when to bring chocolate gateaux home and be extra nice, or so he could predict when I was going to wake up at 3am and be on the bathroom floor because of the pain I was in (ADHD means tracking it myself doesn't happen) I would feel like that was such a violation if he had done it without discussing it with me first because it's my body, my hormones and I just find that really ick.

I\u2019m talking double shifts, overtime, working 7 days a week, hardly sleeping - just working all the time. So as a result, I only saw him approximately 3 times in the past 4 months - and each time we DIDN\u2019T do anything because he was super tired.\n\nAnyway, he came over last night to see me and berated me for eating cookies on my bed saying that I\u2019m messy so I\u2019ll leave crumbs for ants for bite him while he sleeps. I responded by just staring blankly at him for a couple seconds. \n\nHe said \u201coh, I forgot you\u2019re on your period.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cwhat? I\u2019m not on my period.\u201d \n\nHe looked confused and pulled out his phone. He said according to his PERIOD TRACKER - which mind you, I didn\u2019t know he had - I was supposed to start my period since the 13th and by me not being on my period, it means I\u2019m really late.\n\nI told him that I\u2019ve been stressed with work and home life lately so maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s not here yet.\n\nHe said \u201cor maybe you\u2019ve been having fun with other people while I\u2019ve been working hard for us.\u201d\n\nAt this point I\u2019m offended and upset. \n\nHe then demands that I take a pregnancy test. I told him that I don\u2019t just have pregnancy tests lying around. \n\nHe said \u201cokay\u201d and left. \n\nI try calling him - no answer.\n\nHe comes back 10 minutes later with a pregnancy test from the pharmacy up the street. \n\nI was appalled. My jaw is still on the floor.\n\nI told him that I am not pregnant because I haven\u2019t done anything to get pregnant and I\u2019m not taking a pregnancy test and that if he doesn\u2019t trust me, when I\u2019ve done nothing wrong, then he needs to figure out why. \n\nHe said If I can\u2019t take a pregnancy test that just proves that I have something to hide. \n\nI asked him politely to leave and he did. \n\nI thought that was the end of it but this morning I woke up to a bunch of messages from him, his best friend and his sister - all calling me horrible names for \u201ccheating on him.\u201d In one of the messages he calls me an AH for not taking the test to \u201cplease his mind.\u201d\n\nI haven\u2019t responded yet because it\u2019s 6:38am and I don\u2019t know what to say. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
