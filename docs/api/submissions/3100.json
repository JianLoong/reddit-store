He was an avid car collector, when he passed, each of his kids got a car in his will.I inherited a mustang. \n\nWe did Thanksgiving with my husbands parents today as tomorrow we will be driving to my mother's house. While I was finishing up dinner, my husband and his father were outside. I asked my husband to go grab the step stool out of the garage. He and my FIL went down to the garage when my FIL sees the car. This is how the conversation went according to my husband. \nFIL\" woah who's car is that?\"\nHusband\" It's Ops she got it when her dad died.\" \nFIL\" she ever let you drive it?' \nHusband\" I'm the only person she lets drive other than herself.\" \nFIL\" Think she'll let me take it for a spin?\" \nHusband\" dad no she won't.\u00a0 I'm the only other person allowed to drive it. So drop it.\"\nThey then come back up to the house with the step stool. As soon as my FILs foot hit the front door, he asks about the car in the garage. I give him the same story my husband gave him and went about my business. He then asks me if he can drive it. I immediately told him no as no one but my husband and myself drive that car. He demanded to know why and I explained again that it was all I had left of my father aside from the small urn of his ashes. That I didn't really drive it myself as its still too painful. He grumples a bit but I ignore it and turned back to finishing dinner. Once we sat down to eat, my FIL continued to demand to be allowed to drive it or at least ride in it. I again tell him No that my father's car isn't leaving the garage. \nHe continues to demand it through out the rest of dinner but I ignore him. Once they goes to leave he stops at the mantle where my father's urn sat and proceeded to push it off the mantle. It hit the corner of my fireplace and shattered.My husband jumps out of his seat and drags his father out of the house. I'm too stunned to move.My husband comes back inside and tells his mother to get the hell out. She leaves and I follow my husband to the front porch where he demanded to know what the hell his father's problem was. He said \" it was an accident. Besides she should have just let me drive the car and that would have been avoided.\"My husband tells them to leave and not come back that he does not want to see them at all anymore and this was the last straw. They no longer have a son or a granddaughter. His mother begs him to reconsider as he is the last child that has any contact with them. ( Both his older brothers have gone NC with his parents) I cried my eyes out over this and my husband apologized over and over. Should I have just let him drive the car? Or was I right to say no?

If she has no more contact with any of her kids, then the problem clearly isn't the kids. Hopefully she can take this as a wakeup call and ditch is sorry ass because your FIL sounds too dense to change his ways.", "Fuck no! NTA. Good on your husband. There are no adequate words for FIL's behavior. Seriously, WTF is wrong with him?", "NTA. \"It could have been avoided\" if he'd been an adult and accepted \"no\" as the complete sentence that it is. \n\n... I somehow am not surprised that others have gone NC with this man.", "NTA. I'm sorry about your father's ashes. \nHe should have just accepted your answer and respect your boundaries. There's a reason their other children went nc with them.", "NTA, and I'm so sorry he did that to you.  I can see why your husbands siblings are NC.  That was a horrible thing he did to you.  You had every right to say no.", "NTA\n\nDo not reconsider. This is basically an attack on your side of the family. If you can, you should look into some sort of legal recourse. Just mess him up. Your husband is a good man.", "NTA, and no you should not have let him drive the car, holy shit, I'm so sorry he did that.\n\nHonestly if you had killed him and I was on the jury I would vote not guilty.", "NTA. Never give in to greedy, spiteful people like him. Your husband did the right thing by swiftly kicking them out.", "NTA. The moment you said \u201cno\u201d should have ended it right there. And you are allowed to say \u201cno\u201d for whatever reason you want. \n\nIf you had let your FIL drive the car it would have justified his horrible behavior and simply let him know that he could push you around like this in the future. Trust how your spouse handled this.", "NTA - In no way, shape, or form were you an AH in this situation. Firstly, it's a car from your late father. I can see why it is precious to you and likely a heirloom that you may want to pass on to your child. It deserves to be in pristine condition. It's likely you seldom drive it. \n\nThe kicker here was that your Father in Law deliberately and maliciously broke the urn containing your father's ashes...out of pure spite! To punish you! I can see why his other children went NC.\n\nI'm gonna be real honest. That man should not have a place in your life or in that of his grandchildren. He is a sick individual. Super toxic.\n\nHoney, you hold your head up. I'm so glad you have a loving and supportive husband. Keep that nut out of your Iives. I'm so so sorry!", "Definitely not the ahole", "You know you are NTA. Your FIL doesn't respect boundaries and the best course of action is nc.", "OH fuck, no.   \n\nNTA  \n\nJust like a petulant child who didn't get their way.   He not only *intentionally* destroys your father's urn, but also he destroys any chance he or his wife have to know their grandchild/ren or to interact with their son for forever. \n\nWhat a bastard.", "NTA. The father is an abusive asshole who purposely smashed your dad's urn. It's your car; not his. You didn't even need to give him a reason not to drive it. Honestly, you did absolutely nothing wrong: your property was destroyed by your father-in-law. He has a lot to answer for.\n\nYour family should consider reaching out to your MIL. I can't imagine how she feels trapped with this kind of asshole.", "NTA no he should not be allowed to drive your car. There\u2019s a reason why the older 2 have already went NC. So sorry for your loss.", "NTA - I can definitely see why the other siblings already went NC with your FIL, his behaviour was unacceptable.\n\nIt's your car, regardless of the tragic circumstances that led you to getting it, you have full autonomy over it. Your FIL acted like a spoiled child and just like a child threw a tantrum when he didn't get his way, utterly disrespecting you in the process.\n\nDon't even think for a second you did anything wrong here.", "NTA. What kind of person breaks an urn because they are throwing a hissy for not getting their way?  I can see why his other kids don\u2019t involve him in their lives. And glad your husband stands with you on this. So many stories on here have spouses defending their terrible parents", "\u201cHe is the last child that has any contact with them.\u201d\n\nGee, I wonder why.\n\nNTA. I am so, SO sorry that he did that. You are in no way, shape or form the AH here.", "NTA my condolences", "NTA. He is a petulant child. Glad your husband acted right to and kicked him out. I'm so sorry for what happened. That was awful.", "This might be the most NTA of all time.\n\nYou and your husband handled all of this *perfectly* and to be honest, FIL sounds like such a rotten AH that he's turned himself inside out and transformed into a black hole.\n\nWhat he did was sheer, utter evil and your husband was right to immediately kick him out of your lives. And the fact he showed no f'ing remorse and brazenly said he did it because he didn't get to drive the car! It's no wonder the other kids have gone NC with him and frankly, if I was your husband, if I ever heard from him again I'd tell him exactly what would become of him when he dies.", "NTA\n\nFIL says it was an accident, but also that it would not have happened if you had let him drive the car. Which means he deliberately broke the urn because you wouldn't give him what he had no right to expect.\n\nIt seems you feel that the break between your husband and his parents is because of you not letting FIL drive the car. If so, good for you! Being around a person like your FIL isn't healthy for anyone, especially not a child, so your family is better off now. As your husband's siblings have already realized, which just indicates that going no contact is a wise move. Kudos to your husband for kicking his dad out of the house. He may have a period of mourning, time to accept that his dad won't change, but it's for the best.", "NTA nope. And fuk him.", "NTA - I\u2019m so sorry you were put through reliving the trauma of losing your dad. I\u2019m just glad that in this case the Apple (your husband) launched VERY far away from the tree (his sperm donor)", "NTA.  And your husband did well in this!\n\nFIL was fine admiring the car.  He was fine asking his son if he could drive it.  He was pushing it when he asked you if he could drive it.  Your response was perfectly appropriate.  No would have been a complete sentence.  But you thoughtfully explained why.\n\nEverything after that was beyond the pale.  So dad is truly evil.  You are right about no contact there.  What about mom?  Does she support dad or was she equally outraged?", "NTA- i\u2019m glad to see a good husband on here", "NTA. \n\nI actually gasped out loud and my jaw dropped. I'm so sorry you had to deal with this.", "NTA. Op you are absolutely allowed to have boundaries and be the only one who handles your father's car. Your FIL was repeatedly told no and threw a tantrum in response. I hope you can collect the ashes and find another urn to keep them in.\n\nIf it where me I'd go nuclear for the disrespect and take photis if the spilled ashes and broken urn, file a police report for the decreasing human remains, and ask to press charges. \n\nHe can be court ordered to pay restitution and buy another urn. It HAS to be a crime to deliberately disrespect someones ashes like that. That man didn't accidently do anything. It was on purpose and you have full right to let him sit in jail for a while.", "NTA\n\nYou stated your reasons perfectly and with no room to negotiate FIL escalated \n\n\nAnd kudos to your husband.  This was clearly not the first time his dad has shown this kind of behavior and he is now realizing why his siblings don't talk to them.", "Omg what the heck did I just read?  My blood is boiling with rage on your behalf, OP!\n\nYou are definitely NTA here but your FIL is a huge one!\n\nYou definitely were right not giving in to his selfish demands. He sounded like a petulant child throwing a tantrum because he didn\u2019t get his way!  Never give in to a-holes and especially narcissists!\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that your FIL\u2019s other children have gone NC with them. \n\nYour husband was awesome though. He did the right thing kicking them out of your house and life!\n\nI hope you\u2019re ok, OP.  I still cannot fathom FIL\u2019s childish behaviour was. Wow!", "[removed]", "NTA, but don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a extreme reaction by your husband to alienate his loving parents. Clearly familial bonds in their house doesn\u2019t hold as much value as it held in yours.", "Do you even have to ask?\n\nNTA\n\nYour FIL is the a-hole. He sounds like a spoiled little teenager and everything is his and he's entitled to it. Tell him to go buy his own mustang. Your hubby should've laid him out.", "NTA.\nYou don't get to demand a ride in someone's car, much less to be able to drive it. Doesn't matter what kind of car it is or what the backstory is. And no means no.\n\nWe have an unusual car that people find cool, and when out in public people try to just sit in it, lean on it, etc. It's wild. But our friends and family are respectful about it at least. Your FIL is a jerk. \n\nAnd I'm sorry about your dad's ashes. That is unacceptable and beyond rude.", "NTA also I can see why why their oldest son has gone NC.", "My sincerest condolences on the losses of your father; his original passing, as well as today. Blessings Be \u2728", "NTA. \n\nHe\u2019s a grown ass man and no is a completely valid answer. I\u2019m sorry he disrespected your father like that. Glad your husband sent him packing.", "> stops at the mantle where my father's urn sat and proceeded to push it off the mantle.

I wish I could send virtual \ud83e\udec2  hugs. Damn. This is intense. You absolutely did not deserve that and he is a boundary stomper. He doesn't respect boundaries at all.", "His behavior in response to repeated \u201cNOs\u201d was all the proof you. needed of making the right call. \n\nI am so sorry for the destruction of the urn, so soon after the loss of your father.  I hope you can find some peace and healing.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA, obviously, but my heart breaks for the MIL. OP mentioned that FIL is a diagnosed narcissist, so she\u2019s likely been abused for so long she doesn\u2019t know how to get out, or even that she can. Narcissistic abuse is just\u2026another level in how it breaks down your soul and self worth. \n\nOP if you and your husband can maintain contact with MIL without FIL, that would probably be a ray of light in what is otherwise a very dark world.", ">\tHis mother begs him to reconsider as he is the last child that has any contact with them. ( Both his older brothers have gone NC with his parents)\n\nGEE I WONDER WHY\n\nWow FIL is a piece of work. NTA not even a tiny bit.", "I....what? I couldn't even finish this, get as far away as this person as you can possibly get.", "Oh heck. Don't even worry your head about if you're the AH. I can't make it big enough. NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA\n\nWhat a complete and total jerk! I am so sorry you had to go through this. I just want to hug you right now! \n\nCut off all contact now and don't give it a second thought. They do not deserve the mind space.", "NTA. And no. He would have wrecked it.", "He wouldn't have just wanted to ride it once. He would have insisted on driving it again and again. What he did was no accident. He said it could have been avoided if you'd let him drive the car, which proves that he did it on purpose; he did it to hurt you. He specifically targeted the one other thing connected to your father. No wonder your husband's siblings have gone no contact. Keep your car and keys locked away. NTA", "NTA. The car should only be driven now if jnfil is a speed bump. Just wow.", "NTA. There's a reason their other kids don't talk to them.  Had you allowed him to have a ride, he would have pestered you until he drive it.  And then he'd want to drive it all the time.  You did the right thing.  I'm so very sorry.", "NTA", "NTA, how absolutely horrible of him. This is the most horrible thing I've read in a long time. You have zero reason to think you were in any way the AH.", "NTA clearly, and I'm so sorry not only for your loss, but for the desecration of your father's remains.\n\nJust out of curiosity as your answer changes nothing about the verdict or the circumstances of what happened, but is this Mustang unique in any way? It's weird to me that someone lacking the sentimental ties would care so much about a car like this. I mean shit, if your FIL wanted to try a Mustang so badly, just go to a fucking dealership.", "NTA. No one should have to deal with that. My sincerest condolences to you.
