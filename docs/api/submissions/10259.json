Me(18) had a talk with my bio mom(35) about filing my taxes. She told me that I would be filing one of my younger siblings and would receive $7k for the one dependent child. So I inquired a few more questions before giving her my info which she answered vaguely which should\u2019ve been my first red flag. Now initially I had already went to a tax man and he told me with all my W2s I\u2019d only receive $100 so I decided to not file at all. So back to present day I asked her to send me the log in info so I can check when I would be receiving the money. She didn\u2019t respond at first then hours later sent a screenshot of an approved claim of 24k. I immediately said WTF because I did absolutely nothing to earn that so I immediately asked her what\u2019s this and she told me she was \u201ctrying to get me some money\u201d and I told her \u201cno wtf I don\u2019t need to the money if it\u2019ll be fraudulent\u201d she continued to act nonchalant and like this wasn\u2019t a serious matter and I couldn\u2019t do federal time for this. So I called my uncle and cousin about this and they agreed that what she did was fraudulent so I decided to call the lady that did my taxes. When she answered she told me she wasn\u2019t under the impression that I wasn\u2019t okay with this and I just had to sit back and think how didn\u2019t you know if you never got the confirmation from me THE PERSON WHOS FILING?!?!?! So now I\u2019m at lost and don\u2019t know what to do in the morning I will be calling the IRS to get this resolved and get it revoked or stopped I hope and l\u2019ll also be going down to the police station to file a police report because I\u2019m 100% this is fraud but I really need advice I\u2019m an 18 year old that made and very dumb decision but I\u2019d like some advice I from any adult really, thank you.", "created_utc": 1676687239, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1154ki4/wibta_for_pressing_charges_on_my_birth_mom_for/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Otherwise you'll be paying for this for the rest of your life", "NTA. Yes it\u2019s fraud and identity theft. My mom did something like this once. You can report her to the IRS and you can also report the tax preparer for complicity, there\u2019s a form for it. The IRS will mail you a PIN every year that you can use to file your own taxes and if they won\u2019t be able to file in your name again without it. Also, the IRS website has free file options online depending on your income. You can file electronically for yourself without involving another person at all if your taxes aren\u2019t too complicated. It might be worth looking into your credit history too.

When you want to get snippy for opinions on your question YTA", "They asked if they were the asshole for turning their mom in. Not if they were an asshole for not knowing how to do taxes, which is what I was snippy with you about.\n\nIt's not likely they are able to claim the sibling they cared for, depending on the actual amount of financial support they provided and where the sibling's home residence is. This would have probably triggered an audit either way, I've seen audits trigger for far less. Taxes are anything but common sense when it comes to dependents. \nYou do not need to be a judgmental asshole to a teenager that just had their mother commit a felony crime under their name. This child is panicked and reeling from parental betrayal and fear of the law and the tax man.", "Troll. Passive. Aggressive. Troll."]}
