They then sign it online with a self-select pin and/or your prior year AGI as though they're *you.*  Absolutely none of his information is likely to be on the return, if OP were to even be given a copy of it and not just shown a screenshot of bottom line.  \n\nOP now also doesn't have a copy of this for their records.  They don't know the login information used to file to retrieve it that way.  But the IRS should hopefully be able to sort that stuff out.\n\nSometimes these fraudulent filers do make a show of having the \"client\" sign something on paper, which now also gives them your signature to play games with, and allows them to pressure the client if they later balk with \"well clearly you were okay with this\" to discourage them from reporting.\n\nThe entire way these frauds operate is intended to make it harder for you to defend or to provide useful information about the filer when the IRS comes after *you.*  It's all about protecting the fraudulent \"preparer\".\n\nA lot of the time they *are* working with willing participants, or at least ones happy to look the other way for a promise of a big refund.  They'll take a $5k fee on a $25k fraudulent refund and stuff like that.  It's situations like the OP's, where the fraudulent preparer is attracting closely related identity thief filers (like OP's mother) which tends to be a bigger risk for them as the victim is more likely to report quickly rather than wait to see if they get caught by the IRS as a willing participant might.\n\nThe preparer may or may not be caught.  Mom *will* be caught and may then be more motivated to give any info she has on the preparer, who probably gave her false information about who he was anyway; it's identity theft all the way down with these things. Regardless of whether the fraudulent preparer is ever caught, OP needs to get this sorted on their own end as quickly as possible.\n\nGathering evidence and whatnot on the preparer will be done by police and the IRS, it's not OP's responsibility.

Waiting or having any thought of trying to protect their mother will only make things more difficult for them on *so* many levels.", "The \"preparer\" almost certainly won't be anywhere on the return in a case like this.  They take all the personal information given (in this case by OP's mom, ugh) and set up a turbotax or similar account.  They sign with something like prior AGI and a self-select PIN *as* the victim.  It looks to the IRS like it was a self-filed return by the victim until the victim either reports or responds to the inevitable friendly letter from the IRS.\n\nThey also now have enough information to commit other forms of identity theft.\n\nI use \"victim\" in this case because OP very much is.  But all too often people are willing to go along or at least ignore or be talked into ignoring red flags and look the other way when promised a big refund.  Either way, the preparer's information will appear nowhere on the fraudulent return.\n\nBut it doesn't *need* to be for OP to report.  Whether the fraudulent preparer is caught or not, which is a job for the IRS and police, OP must immediately take action to start the process of clearing their name.", "Nah people just don't like truth."]}
