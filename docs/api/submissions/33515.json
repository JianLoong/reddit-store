Text or video chat is not ideal for this.\n\nAsk your one freshman friend if he will level with you about why he chose to share that information with you and why at the time he did and in front of your mutual?\n\nIs this one freshman friend at school someone you\u2019ve known for very long and feel like has good character and morals/values similar to those you would like to or feel like you do try to live by?\n\nDoes this friend have a significant other on campus or back home? Have there been times when this person has wanted you to go to certain types of parties or outings with you that you have declined or that he feels like you\u2019re \u201cnot much fun at\u201d because you\u2019re not interested in \u201cexploring other options\u201d or helping him/her/them flirt with other people because you already have a girlfriend and have told your friend you\u2019re happy and y\u2019all intend to try to stay a couple despite it being long distance while you\u2019re at school?\n\nDo you think your friends might be resentful, envious, or jealous of you for having a gf and being closer to her and spending some of your time communicating with her rather than being always available for your friend? \n\nYou may also ask the mutual in a separate discussion hey what do you think is up with that? I\u2019m not interested in cheating on my gf; I was just curious who my friend was talking about. At the same time, it is a little odd because I do have a gf as you know and he knows that too.

NTA  Your friend clearly has baggage or loves drama.", "I guess the answer to that is whether for you it's the first step to cheating.

He\u2019s crying over nothing lol", "In that case, the mutual friend probably just genuinely believes that. Tell your girlfriend about it and get her thoughts.", "Possibly.
