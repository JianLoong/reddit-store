There's been lots of talk about outfits and how much fun it will be etc. We have lots of hybrid and WFH staff, so getting all together is something we were all looking forward to.\n\nMy office is split into several departments, and we have 2 floors in our office building. I don't know anyone outwith my own department and I work hybrid. I recognise people from the canteen and the locker room but I don't know their names.\n\nThere is a guy on the other floor who has a locker near mine, and we have chatted a few times, but only small talk and we never exchanged names. I never got the vibe that he was trying to flirt with me.\n\nOn Friday, I saw him and we had a short conversation about the party. He told me what he was going to be wearing and showed me a photo of the new waistcoat he had bought, then told me that he had bought a top hat to wear because he's always wanted one but hadn't had a reason before. I told him his waistcoat looked nice. (Sorry for rambling, I just want to include all of the details.)\n\nAt the party we were seated within our own department to start, and then were free to move about after the welcome speech.\n\nAs it happens, I didn't see Top Hat Guy until I was leaving (I left about 30 minutes before the official end). We made eye contact, so I smiled and nodded but he didn't respond. I thought maybe he didn't see me after all and thought nothing of it.\n\nToday in the office Top Hat Guy spoke to me and told me it was rude to mislead him into thinking I was interested in him and should have told him I was in a relationship because I've embarrassed him and \"strung [him] along\". He sounded really upset and borderline angry.\n\nI said I didn't do anything to mislead him but apologised for any miscommunucation on my part. Had I known he was interested, I would have told him straight away I was married.\n\nI don't want to start gossipping in the office and my husband will take my side automatically. I didn't think I was in the wrong but he made me feel like I was.\n\nTL;DR: A work aquaaintance thought I was single so was going to make a move on me at the work festive party. He learned I was in a relationship and told me I was rude for stringing him along and hiding the truth.

I have the same experiences, I am nice to people and then they think I'm interested in them.  Uh no, a hi doesn't mean I want you.

There's a reason many corporations discourage or forbid workplace relationships; they lead to drama.", " NTA.

I get it, women are conditioned not to complain and to keep the peace, but please consider: This guy is unhinged enough to miss the wedding ring on a woman he likes *and* to think there's something serious between you when you don't even know his name.  These are not indicators of stability. \n\nThe odds that he's, at this exact moment, telling people lies that will damage your professional reputation are about the same as the odds that the sun will rise in the east tomorrow morning.  \n\nI have been a management consultant for over a decade. I get a view of office politics that most people never do.  The person above is dead right when they say, Cover Your Ass. \n\nAlso, do this in writing. If you allow HR to do this in person or over the phone, it's much easier to screw you later.  You don't have to do much.  Just send an email to HR, CC your boss, bcc a non-work email to keep a copy, and explain how uncomfortable the situation made you.\n\nYou may never need that email, but if you do, you'll be so fucking happy to have it.", "I do wear one.

That.. and remind him that women do not exist and interact with men for the sole purpose of being a potential romantic or sexual partner. Men and woman can speak. Tell him that it\u2019s unfortunate that he feels strung along, but if he is going to insist on making this an issue, then unfortunately you feel attacked and harassed in your workplace, and maybe it\u2019s best that you don\u2019t interact in future. \n\nHoping you were flirting and somehow missing your ring? Honest mistake. Disappointment? Valid. Blaming you and angrily coming at you (at work) saying that you let him on (at work) simply by speaking to him (at work / a work function)? Workplace hostility. \n\nFile the whole situation with HR right now.  That way if he escalates or gets upset, they\u2019ve got a record that you tried to keep everything above board."]}
