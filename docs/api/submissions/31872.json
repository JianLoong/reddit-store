He told me what he was going to be wearing and showed me a photo of the new waistcoat he had bought, then told me that he had bought a top hat to wear because he's always wanted one but hadn't had a reason before. I told him his waistcoat looked nice.

We made eye contact, so I smiled and nodded but he didn't respond. I thought maybe he didn't see me after all and thought nothing of it.\n\nToday in the office Top Hat Guy spoke to me and told me it was rude to mislead him into thinking I was interested in him and should have told him I was in a relationship because I've embarrassed him and \"strung [him] along\". He sounded really upset and borderline angry.\n\nI said I didn't do anything to mislead him but apologised for any miscommunucation on my part.

So you think women have more empathy default by gender ?  no wonder I thought  you were a woman. You may think you are self aware, it's more self-loathing. Does your twin think he is ignorant as you do? And you'd love to be less grown up?  why? do you want to be a child ?  so you can say ignorant things? You don't have to be drunk to do something dumb, go build something stupid if you want to I guess? then you are just stupid, not a drunk"]}
