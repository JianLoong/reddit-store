Way to post here to alleviate your guilt. Your sister is right.

You sound like a solid employer (and father) trying your best in a difficult situation, and that\u2019s all you can do. \n\nPlease don\u2019t be too hard on yourself.", "NTA, and it boggles my mind that your sister thinks she has any business in your bedroom, at all. \"Unannounced\"?

There was no emergency, there was no reason for her to show up without calling you first and getting your permission.\n\nYou seriously need to set this boundary with your sister, because right now she obviously thinks she can show up whenever she wants without talking to you first. And it's clear that if no one had opened the door for her, she would have let herself in with your key... which again, given there was no emergency, would not be okay.", "NTA.  You're a man?

Women aren't turned on by sick men because they have their shirt off.", "NTA - but it wouldnt be the worst idea in the world to put a shirt on if the nanny is coming into your room, no way to be certain if she is comfortable with your shirtlessness", "I disagree from the perspective of a nurse.  If my boss got sick and somehow ended up on my unit I would be comfortable with full nudity including inserting a rectal tube and foley catheter.  The super conservative perspectives here are weird.

I think it\u2019s ick AF bc it\u2019s a workplace situation in a private home with a power differential. Nanny who is ten years younger in her early 20s should be nowhere near the boss\u2019s bedroom. Sick or not. Get someone else to come over. There is so much potential for this being unprofessional given she\u2019s the mother figure to the kid. It\u2019s caring work and there\u2019s so many ways this can potentially develop badly.
