I don't agree with the way she raises her children, that is why I don't want her to look after my child.\n\nThe nanny only went to my daughter's bedroom, never mine.   \nI'm not sure people here will find that shocking, I've never heard of such a situation before.  \n\n\nMy sister and I, even if we were born in the country we currently live in, received a strong culture identity from our parents, who are not from here (they went back to their country of origin).

It's true that her way of seeing things is not considering other feelings, but only what she thinks is good.

Even though you\u2019re not in an office you are her boss and you should remain professional in your appearance and conduct around her. I understand the human nature of wanting to discuss this with her for her comfort but *because* of the boss/employee relationship, that\u2019s not the best idea. Be the authority figure that you are in this dynamic. It happened once, no harm no foul, but ensure that it doesn\u2019t happen again.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not like it was sexual. You were literally sick. It\u2019s fine and what any normal human would do.", "Nah. Just to chime in as someone who has had a nanny and also has a husband. If I were traveling and my husband was too sick to be up with the kids, I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with her going into the bedroom except for the fact that I wouldn\u2019t want her to get sick. I think in this situation you should have had her drop off/pick up items from outside your door. But, if you weren\u2019t contagious, not a big deal though for her comfort best to be fully clothed - she is an employee, not a family member and not your nurse. I do understand you sister\u2019s concern though and her perspective is partially why it is important to be fully clothed.", "NTA.

Why does your sister care so much?", "You've left out the age of the nanny which makes me pretty suspicious here to be honest.", "Jealousy?", "Yeah... could be grounds for harassement OP. Not cool.\n\nThis situation is weird as fuck.

I am sure that she would appreciate a quick email or a text to explain what happened today (as you said, she heard the commotion, and it would be best to make sure she knows it had *nothing* to do with her actions). \n\nI might also add in that you value her professionalism and that you are serious about ensuring that she feels safe and comfortable in your home, and to invite her to be forthcoming with any concerns she ever has, about anything, in the future. \n\nSounds like all is good, but a reminder might just make her feel that extra bit of support, and will keep the lines of communication open which is most important. \n\nHope you feel better soon!", "he wasn't walking around.. he was sleeping.", "Not\u2026. but you would be wise to tighten up appearances. No shirtless for a start. \nAnd lock your damn exterior doors.

Your sister is acting crazy. I wouldn't let her back into the house until she apologises for being disrespectful towards both you and the nanny. There's no excuse for shouting which would have embarrassed the nanny (even if she didn't show it) and frightened the child.", "Your sister needs to learn that this is real life, not a cheesy romance novel. You were too sick to get out of bed enough to get a shirt so the woman you trusted with your child gave you a glass of water. No offense, but there's a solid chance she didn't notice or pay attention to your shirt status. That's very different than \"billionaire/ceo/single dad tragically falls ill and must be cared for tirelessly by the gorgeous, 23 year old nanny who could be a supermodel. She takes one look at his muscular physique, and they fall madly in love.\"\n\nAlso, your sister is implying that both you and the nanny lack professionalism.

You were sick, feeling awful and probably sweaty. I totally understand why you would want to forgo the shirt. And from you have told us you nanny also understood.

He overreacted and doesn\u2019t sound like she brought you any water nor nurse to get well soon", ">  there is NO employer/employee dress code unless one was made at the start of the job. \n\nThis is too far the other way since being naked in front of non-medical employees is obviously sexual harassment even when they work in your house. \n\nHowever, it is common for men to not wear shirts in non-sexual situations (a lifeguard might be shirtless while working!), so this is only an issue if the nanny thinks it was an attempt to extend their relationship into something non-professional. If he was truly to sick to get out of bed, I think it's reasonable to assume he had no ulterior motive and the nanny wasn't worried about it.", "I don\u2019t know why this is being downvoted. Appropriate boundaries are important", "It's 23", "Why are you saying that like he intended for her to just walk up in their house", "According to what I\u2019ve read on this subreddit, 23 is a little old for a 33 year old\u2019s second wife.", "Eh, but isn't shirtless some weird gray area? It's not obsene, you would see same at a beach or pool function, if you were to be shirtless out in public you wouldn't \nbe breaking the law... does he really need to put on a shirt in his own home just cause she's there?", "I was already feeling that what happened might be inappropriate, and some comments confirmed my suspicions. I send her a text to excuse myself for what happened, as I was the one who let her enter in my bedroom. \n\nSince the beginning I've told her that she shouldn't hesitate to tell me if something was wrong or if she didn't feel at ease with something. I also know that because of the employer-employee dynamic, it might be difficult to her to talk.  \nThanks for the advice", "He was sick. He was in his bedroom. The nanny was helping out as he wasn\u2019t well enough to take care of his daughter or himself. Would it have been better he gets up and goes to the kitchen in his joggers and no shirt? Is being shirtless any different than a woman being in a sports bra and leggings?\n\nThis is ridiculous. He isn\u2019t putting the moves on the nanny. The nanny probably doesn\u2019t think he is and realizes how people feel when they are sick. I mean, she\u2019s probably been sick herself a time or two. \n\nThis political correctness is a leap too far. \n\nProceed with the down voting."]}
