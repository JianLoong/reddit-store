{"id": 670, "submission_id": "yfds8s", "title": "AITA for backing out of a friends trip after it became a groomsman trip for a wedding im not in", "selftext": "I have had a group of four friends since elementary school. The five of us have stayed close friends through elementary, middle and high school (going to the same schools) and then through university (separate universities, but we would visit often and stayed very close). We are all 26yo guys, and have been friends for 19 years now. \n\nOne of the guys in the group, Brandon, is getting married in January. Brandon asked the other three guys to be groomsmen in his wedding, alongside his two brothers and two of his friends from college. this left me the only homie in the group who wasn't a groomsman. I was upset when I first realised, but  I talked to my parents about it and they reminded me its Brandon's wedding and not a 'group event', he can have who he likes up there, and just because im not a groomsman doesn't mean Brandon's doesn't consider me a friend. and that he does already have 7 people up there beside him, which is a lot. \n\nmy parents are the only one I ever told I was upset about it, and now I think im pretty well over it. they've had a few grooms-party gatherings, like they went for drinks after they got fitted for suits, and went golfing together, and Brandon and his fianc\u00e9 had a bbq for their wedding party - that's always a weird reminder for me. \n\nmy friends and I usually go on a trip in December to watch a football game. we started the now tradition in our first year in university, and have been going every year since. its always just been the 5 of us friends, and we go for like 3/4 days. on Tuesday my three friends came to me and wanted to know my opinion on inviting the other groomsmen on the trip as a surprise to Brandon. the three of them were clearly all for this idea, and really wanted me to say yes. \n\nI told them I wasn't sure, I had to think about it (which was awkward because it was obvious they thought I was just going to say yes). I spoke to them about it today, and said honestly I dont want to go on a trip being the only non-groomsman. I know Brandon's brothers, and I've met his college friends, and they're all cool, but I dont want to be the clear odd man out. I told my friends that they should do it, I just won't go this year - which was fine for me because I could do with saving some money because I have a separate destination wedding to go to in February now. \n\nthe other guys won't invite the other groomsmen if it means I won't come. but its clear they're also annoyed at them not being able to invite them because of me. one of my friends spoke to me separately and he told me he really thinks im not fair or a good friend, and asked if its because I resent not being a groomsman. feels like any decision I make besides agreeing to go on the trip with the four other groomsmen is going to make them mad at me. \n\nAITA for backing out of the trip if I am going to be the only non-groomsman?", "created_utc": 1666931031, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yfds8s/aita_for_backing_out_of_a_friends_trip_after_it/", "score": 9348, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They're gonna be talking about the wedding and whatnot. Stuff you can't be involved in. It's not about resenting being left out of the wedding. It's wanting to do your traditional trip, not a groomsman's trip (which by definition would exclude you). I mean at this point, I'd just stay home anyway. They can have their big thing with the guys from the wedding.\n\nI would think good friends would understand. The trip became something that's not about your friend group. It turned into a wedding-trip.", "NTA and I think it\u2019s time to question why your 19 year old \u201cfriendships\u201d don\u2019t consider your feelings and why your friendship is not as valued", "NTA. You didn\u2019t make a big deal about not being a groomsman. They are the AH\u2019s for ruining the trip that has been a tradition for years. If they want the others to come then you have every right to stay home. At that point it\u2019s no longer keeping the tradition but changing it to a wedding event.", "NTA. I think your mom is wrong here. If you guys have been friends for this long as you say then it would have been nice to get an explanation as to why you were the one not chosen. \n\nBrandon may still consider you a friend, but by virtue of having excluded you from the wedding party and not spoken to you about it, it\u2019s clear that friendship is somehow changed. It\u2019s all true it\u2019s his wedding and he gets to have who he wants, but that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t get to feel a way about it. \n\nSo the move to turn what was a trip for the five of you into something else is much more hurtful in that context and the fact that none of them seem to realize it is weird. \n\nWere I in your position I would tell them that you\u2019re happy for them to go as a groomsmen trip. Truly. Have fun. If your friend continues to push you about it, I\u2019d keep it simple and say \u201cI\u2019m not going either way at this point so you really should go and enjoy it with the groomsmen.\u201d  And then keep a low profile to get through the wedding.  After the wedding I would talk to the groom and find out what\u2019s going on with your friendship and see if it can be repaired.", "NTA.  It would be a really awkward trip if they invited the groomsmen and you were the odd man out.  Unfortunately I think your friendship is never going to be the same again though.  Yeah he can choose who he wants in his wedding, but for just one of you to be excluded it seems there may be more to it than you know.", "NTA. You've been cordial and respectful and you don't owe them anything further. That they're now trying to make you feel guilty for the way they've been excluding you is manipulative and childish. Especially since in so many of these situations your exclusion is centered around the importance of 'tradition'.", "NTA.  I hate to tell you, but your friendship with these guys has already irrevocably changed.  How's it supposed to recover from being excluded from a major experience?\n\nIronically, the groom might be the one with least culpability for this.  Yes, he didn't include you in the wedding but he might not realize the damage this is causing.  You could have been excluded because of the bride or limited number of guests.  Or he could just be a dick.  It's too late in the game to join the wedding party; the damage has been done on that.  But still, ask him directly why you weren't included so you can get some closure instead of wondering why.\n\nBut the other three wanting to invite the groomsmen on a trip that's become a tradition between the five of you, that's on them.  Saying you're not a good friend for not agreeing to this is a flag showing that they're not valuing you and resenting your decision.\n\nIf you do decide to go on the trip, be prepared for the groomsmen to magically show up.  They'll either be counting on you making a scene objecting to this, thereby making you the bad guy.  Or you won't object and be miserable and excluded from the group experience.  The groomsmen would exclude you because from their POV, they don't know you and you weren't a close enough friend to be invited to the wedding.  Your friends exclusion because they've already chosen to drop you from the group.", "NTA.\n \nThe three lads in your friend group already got to break the ice with the other groomsmen by going to golf and enjoying a BBQ, etc.  I think it is inappropriate of your friends to not put themselves in your shoes and to invite a bunch of other dudes on a trip that was originally and traditionally for the five of you. It would be way too awkward to go on a trip with all these guys after being excluded.  I don't think you are in the wrong at all for feeling this way.\n\nIn any case, you are clearly mature and adult enough to respect Brandon's wishes - so maybe your friends should take a page out of your book and not make the trip uncomfortable for you.  Perhaps next year, after the wedding, you may feel more comfortable going away with them.  Either way, it's your money, time, and energy.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't make drama when you learned that you were the only one not asked to be a groomsman...you only discussed it with your parents.  And you clearly said nothing as they proceeded to do all of their wedding party things.\n\nIt's pretty clear that this situation has hurt you.  Did no one ever address the issue - or the reason for the omission - with you?  They just went on with everything, as though it was expected that you weren't supposed to be a part of this event?  What is going on with that?\n\nIt's especially bizarre that your other three friends thought you would be okay adding the other groomsmen to the traditional football friend experience.  \n\nYou have been nothing but considerate throughout this situation.  You made clear that they should make this year's event a wedding-related thing if they so desired (which they clearly did), but that you weren't comfortable participating.  \n\nNone of them have any right to be negative or give you pushback regarding your desire not to attend this year's event.  They haven't treated you particularly well about all of this (as you still don't have an answer about your omission from the wedding party).  \n\nYou aren't being petty.  And you have every right to only participate in those events where you feel you are welcomed.\n\nAgain, you didn't create drama about not being a groomsman, although they ALL had to know that you were hurt by the omission.  They should be embarrassed about putting pressure on you.", "NTA You weren't invited to the groomsmen events like golfing and the groomsmen shouldn't be invited to the friends\u2019 trip. They're two different groups. Some members are just in both groups and others aren't \n\nThe groomsmen group is all the groomsmen minus OP. \nThe friendsgroup is three of the groomsmen and OP minus the brothers and college friends. \n\nIf they didn't feel like adding you to the groomsmen events I don't see how they can expect you to invite them in the friends\u2019 trip. \n\nIf they're mad I'd ask them \u201chow come you don't want to mix the two groups when it's me being excluded but want to combine them when it's the other people?\u201d \n\nTo be quite honest, I think you're more understanding than I would be already. One of your best friend of 19 years gets married and everyone is a groomsman but you? He could've chosen just one college friend and included you instead of singling you out. It seems to me they don't think you're as close as you feel they are.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"the other guys won't invite the other groomsmen if it means I won't come. but its clear they're also annoyed at them not being able to invite them because of me.\" .. THis really is THEIR problem, they are being unreasonable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey just want to cheap out on the groomsmen activities. You are fine not to agree.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" feels like any decision I make besides agreeing to go on the trip with the four other groomsmen is going to make them mad at me.\" .. Let them be mad. It would be a waste of time and money to be the only non-groomsman on a groomsmen trip. And: **They will do a lot of activities for the groom, that will COMPLETELY change the trip - and you will be expected to pay for him and all of that, too.**  Because you are \"his very good friend\".  - So **your NO is reasonable.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: \"chang\" to \"change\"", "Did Brandon ever even give a hint as to why you weren't a groomsman?  Like, even if it was a numbers thing, I would SAY something", "NTA\n\nThey asked **for a reason**. Them asking means that they were self-aware enough to know that you might have an issue with. Well now they have confirmation. To do anything to dismiss your valid feelings (valid enough that they were self-aware enough to realize they could exist) would be shitty on their part.", "NTA. Your friends are being extremely insensitive here. Whether you\u2019ve said anything or not it is glaringly obvious that you would feel hurt by being the only one out of the group to not be a groomsman and inviting the other people who were also more important than you on this trip that is meant to be about your group is rubbing salt in the wound. It\u2019s honestly so egregious that I can\u2019t help wondering whether it\u2019s intentional and these guys are just bullies and you don\u2019t know what real friendship is. \n\nI also think the friend getting married is a massive AH for including 3 out of 4 friends as groomsmen and leaving you out. Yes, 7 people is a lot. 8 is a lot. They are both a lot. Why does the line have to be drawn with only you outside it? The decent thing to do if you have a group of people and can\u2019t have them all is to have none of them and stick with your family as groomsmen. \n\nI hate to say it but I think your parents were just trying to make you feel better. You have not been treated fairly by your friends and I strongly advise you to start investing your time and energy in finding better people to share your life with. \n\nIf it were me I wouldn\u2019t be going on the trip. I wouldn\u2019t be going to the wedding either. \n\nI\u2019m sorry to be so harsh in my judgment and I\u2019m sorry for this hurtful situation for you.", "Why does this yearly guy trip even have to be about Brandon\u2019s wedding. Why even invite the other guys, I don\u2019t get to? Are ur other friends close now to the other groomsmen?", "NTA. You also have pretty much a perfect reason not to go. You have a wedding related expense they don't, namely a different wedding to attend. Just make it \"Hey, I'd love to go but I have this other wedding I just can't back out of. Being in the wedding party you KNOW how these other expenses can creep up on you, so I'm just going to have to bow out this year.\"\n\nDon't make it about the other's at all. Best of all is, from your own post it IS a legit reason!", "NTA- you mentioned this trip was a tradition between the five of you, now they want to make it all about the wedding and it\u2019s almost like rubbing it in your face that you are not in the wedding party. Do not let them manipulate you into going and having all the other people there. Your feelings are absolutely valid but I hope you realize that maybe you consider them more of a friend than what they consider you. I know it\u2019s hard but hopefully you will find friends that feel the same towards you as you to them.\n\nETA- The \u201cfriend\u201d that pulled you aside to say that you were not being a good friend has some ba**s!!! Way to try to gaslight and to manipulate you into doing something you are not comfortable with.", "NTA, but i would say that you should start to keep yourself busy. If they ask you why you can't come to this and that just keep busy and say \"oh i have no time\" so they can't hunker you down with the \"oh your just jealous\" bit. How to keep busy? join a gym, find a club or just get out and see the town. Your not going to go anywhere if you let this simmer, they've clearly moved on so, so should you. Take a deep breath and a leap forward. Being around them as they plan this wedding is just going to bring up bad blood, let it cool then when the wedding is over invite some of them for sports and drinks. Don't be afraid, if you can go through this the world is nothing but a breeze.", "NTA \n\nI would confront Brandon about why I was excluded as a groomsman & ask him why he wanted to end a 19 year friendship this way. \n  All these bonding activities with the other friends & 3 additional groomsmen have most likely soured the friendship & you deserve a reason why it is ending this way. I doubt i personally would be attending any more events or the wedding. \n These wedding stories were friends & family relationships get destroyed are becoming more & more common.", "I\u2019ve seen lots of weddings where bachelor parties, trips beforehand, etc include a whole group of friends, not just the groomsmen. In that sense, it\u2019s not completely weird. \n\nOn the other hand, I understand why you feel the way you do and you\u2019re justified for not wanting to go. \n\nBrandon got to choose his wedding party and you get to choose which events you participate in. \n\nNTA", "NTA - I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re being excluded and ganged up on at the same time. Tell you\u2019re friends that you\u2019re going to bow out this year for financial reasons. They\u2019ve made it too awkward.", "You handled this really maturely. Explained why you'd feel uncomfortable & offered not to go so that they could have their groomsmen trip. This sounds like one of those situations where none of your friends are going to understand how you feel, until they are the only one excluded from something.\n\n\nAs there's already a bad feeling between them & you & you need to save money anyway, have you reached out & told them you really don't want to go on a trip where it's clear everyone is unhappy with you and you weren't lying about needing to save money. So you're going to step out of the trip, & as you're doing that they should stick to their original plan of inviting the groomsmen & pick up the tradition again next year? That way you can stay out of the wedding drama completely. NTA", "NTA and you have handled this really graciously. They are putting you in a terrible position.", "NTA. Wow they're inconsiderate", "NTA. What they suggested breaks the tradition, doesn't it? I would suggest that the annual trip is now broken, never to be mended. You didn't ruin it. The groomsmen did. They obviously are not the friends you thought they were. I suggest you look elsewhere for a worthwhile group to start a new tradition.", "NTA, I can see how this happened without it meaning Brandon dislikes you, every groomsman usually needs to be paired with a bridesmaid and that\u2019s already a massive wedding party, his wife to be probably told him to match a certain number and you were the last on the totem pole of special people to him. But where he is a bad friend is 1. He could have pulled you aside to let you know why you didn\u2019t make the cut before announcing his groomsmen, 2. He could have still invited you to the bonding activities, unless of course a family member is paying for it all but usually the best man books these things and collect money from the groomsmen so he could have had you join in. The lack of communication to you and no acknowledgement of making you the odd man out and expecting you to be a chum and pretend what\u2019s going on is no big deal honestly makes all your friends shit, I don\u2019t think they dislike you I think they just don\u2019t have the balls to have an honest and reassuring conversation because they know what they\u2019ve been doing is awful.", "NTA- your are purposely being left out and they are rubbing  it in your face at every turn . \n\nI\u2019m sorry but it doesn\u2019t sound like these people are your friends .  \n\nTrip is ruined already. If you go they will be mad they couldn\u2019t invite the other groomsmen and things will be awkward and they will be mad at you  .\n\n If you don\u2019t go, they dont get to treat you like a second class citizen and will still be mad at you for not going and making things awkward for them.\n\nGet what I\u2019m saying ? \n\nTime to find new friends. Ones that take your feelings into consideration and include you .", "NTA and it's all well and good that those picked to be groomsmen have all of these opinions about you feeling bad for not being a groomsmen. How would they feel to be the ONLY one not picked? Of course they don't want you to make any sort of deal about it. Then they would have to acknowledge it was a shifty thing to do to you.", "I don't think you bring resentful over not being asked to be a groomsman has anything to do with this. Brandon has already had multiple events with his wedding party and now these guys want to have another one, which is weird, and it's going to be super awkward if you're there. Is this a surprise bachelor party? \n\nIt seems like they're trying to expand your friends group but in a way that screws you over. Even if you are the most understanding about it you can be, it's still inherently excluding you while forcing you on the trip. Why? I don't see why they're doing this. NTA.", "NTA you would be the odd man out.  stick to your guns and don't go", "NTA.  At this point, if it were me, I would tell them I am not going regardless, and that even if they don't invite the groomsmen I won't go, so there's no point in not moving forward with their plan.  Take yourself out of the equation completely so that they can't blame you for it later.  And if they do, then maybe they're growing into people you don't need to be as close with anymore.", "NTA \n\nInfo: Are u at least invented at the wedding?\n\nI find it so strange... Does no one of your friends once talked about it? Does they exlude you before?", "Nta you handled it super respectfully. They know bring the only one not invited sucks for you and they would hate being in that spot so they need you to be ok with this to alleviate their own bad feelings.\n\nDon't change because they pester you. Tell them you are fine with not being in the wedding but you also don't see the need to make every of your outings of said weddings and you do have other things to look out for aka weddings you are actually part in.", "NTA. They have placed you in an unfortunate position. None of them seem to be able to understand how this situation is making you feel or have put themselves in your shoes. Don't go if you don't want to go. You were not the author of this drama and you can choose to partake or to not partake in it if you so please. They must accept that, just as you had to accept that you were not a groomsman.", "NTA and you deserve to have your boundaries respected", "NTA. Brandon is TA for asking absolutely everyone else except you to be his groomsman. Yes 7 is already a lot, but 1 more wouldn\u2019t have hurt anything and he knew what he was doing. Your other friends are also TA for trying to turn a traditional trip into a groomsman trip knowing you\u2019re not one and then getting mad at you. Honestly I would get a new group of friends.", "hard NTA,  \n\n\nI would have burned those bridges, they chose to not include you, each and every one of them should of questioned why you weren't involved, and you should of been told why you weren't involved.   \nyour \"friends\" don't respect you, they don't care about your feelings, and they don't deserve your time.   \nsounds like they kept you around because you somehow benefitted them, seems like you need to find some friends who also provide benefit to you.", "NTA but it's burning me that you don't know why you and ONLY you were excluded from the wedding party. \n\nAnd with things like this, unless the bride doesn't like you or you're a weirdo that makes women uncomfortable or something like that, they tend to be for really AH reasons like financial status, race, looks or them seeing you as the \"loser\" of the group. \n\nI imagine you're not comfortable facing the possibility of this but their behaviour and their insistence that YOU give in to their demands, else you're not a good friend, tells me that the possibility is there. And I'm sorry if that's the case.\n\nRegardless, you're nowhere near the AH here. You've handled everything with way more grace than they deserve. Good luck.", "NTA and you should have told them the truth about being resentful. Better to be honest than hold it back. If your other friends don't realize how they would feel being in the same position, what kind of friends are they?

I feel for you.", "Dude, I feel so sorry for you. I think your friends are blinded by this event, not realizing that this hurt you. Like you said, you\u2019ve known each other for 19 years. They should know this would be hurtful and at least not try to kinda exclude you from a tradition you\u2019re a part of. They feel bad you won\u2019t come, but for the wrong reasons it seems. I think your friends are TA.", "NTA\n\nI'd skip the wedding too - especially if the groom has never even mentioned the awkward situation he created.

In fact your friends are double ass holes here. If I was in their position I'd be like, shucks, OP has been left out of a lot of stuff recently, for this year's trip let's go out of our way to make him feel included, you know pack his favourite beers, maybe take a side trip to somewhere he's always wanted to go etc etc. I would not under any circumstances have tried to turn it into the very event he's been excluded from already. They shouldn't have entertained inviting the other guys in the first place. This not really fitting in with your finances is a side issue and immaterial to that.", "You are already being really gracious about an astronomical, deliberate, calculatedly cruel slight.

NTA and I\u2019m sorry, Brandon\u2019s decision is one of the most nasty things I\u2019ve ever read about.", "NTA - not at all. \n\nHow you stayed friends with him is beyond me. You do not do that your friend of 19 years, unless he, and they, have never considered you a close friend in the first place.\n\nThat can be a hard place to be - thinking you mean the same to everyone in your group as they do to you.\n\nUnfortunately, Brandon doesn't seem to see you on the same level he sees the other 3. He has replaced you with his college buddies. We all change our friend groups as we go through life, it is part of growing up. Real homies are the people we will drop everything for and travel across the world if they need something, no matter how long it has been since we have seen or talked to each other.\n\nTo not even invite you to something as informal as the cookout at his house tells you all you need to know.

What Brandon did to you was a shitty thing to do to a \"close friend\" and no one I know would do that to people they love.  I would have a face to face and ask him straight up why he did it. \n\nHomies are supposed to be for life, through thick and thin. They become your family and family shouldn't do that to each other. Your homies did not have your back, at all.\n\nIt sounds like it is time to find some new friends who want you around, not the type of people who ask your permission to replace you with other people.\n\nI would let them go on the trip, save for your mini-vacation on your destination wedding, and focus on you and having a good time.", "NTA\n\nIt's a little bit weird for me that you are the only one in the friendgroup who isn't a part of the weddingparty. \n\nLike the whole group did weddingstuff together and it was okay without you.\n\nNow they are planing a trip with the guys they had gatherings in the past, with the guys they bonded without you. \n\nI wouldn't go either to the trip. I'm the person, which would create distance to the friends after such an exclusion of an important event.", "NTA. Say the others should definitely attend, say you'll still go, then have a last-minute issue crop up that means you have to cancel nearer the time.\n\nI understand your feelings are hurt and unfortunately, it's hard to imagine your friendship with these guys and the groom remaining the same now. It seems really strange to have such a big wedding party but leave you out of it. I don't blame you if you do feel resentful.", "NTA. If you\u2019re not feeling it you\u2019re not feeling it and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. I would be afraid of feeling like the odd man out on the trip.

You will never forget the exclusion they imposed on you, they will never forget your \u2018pettiness\u2019 for not being okay to invite the other groomsmen. I hope you can look into developing new friendships as well. Priorities and relationships changes over time and it\u2019s time to develop new support circles in which you guys can support each other.", "SEVEN groomsmen? WTF.", "NTA. I find it weird that Brandon didn't want to talk to you and give you a reason why you are the odd one out in the friendship group though... just back out graciously, that's all you can do", "NTA.

I think you have handled this like a true gentleman.  I have been in similar positions, more than I care to remember.  I'm pretty old.  I've never been the most popular one in any friend group I've ever been in.  Partly because I've always been rather poor at taking social cues.  Today they call it Asperger's or  some mild spectrum bullshit.  Back then, you were just a dork.  I was appreciated for my intellect and kind nature, but never fit in 100%.\nSometimes I'd hear about events after the fact that everyone else had been to: parties, concerts,bar hops, weddings, road trips, etc.  Especially events that primarily involved couples.  Couples oriented groups like even numbers and I was single.  That would cause me profound sadness and feelings of isolation that would take a long time to get over.  Some of those friends go back and far as kindergarten. I could never ask why I wasn't included because I was too scared of what I might hear.\nSo I really empathize with you today and I fucking hate it.\n   I doubt the groom is being  spiteful towards you. My guess is that he has no reason to be.   He and the other other 3 are definately being dicks, probably because it's awkward for everyone and guy groups don't like emotional encounters.  I don't really think you need to say any more than you did.  You told the dude that you didn't want to be the only one not in the wedding party on the trip. That will be the narrative between them.  They know you feel slighted. It will probably take a good bender or two for it to be brought up, but I'm sure it will be eventually.  \nA few people asked about the bride.  You didn't respond.  Do you know each other well,,? Does she like you ,,? There can be some peculiar dynamics between wives of friends and single guy friends.  I know I have been seen as a less than desirable influence  by a few new wives trying to civilize their young husbands.  My point is every detail of any wedding goes through the bride.  \nI'm assuming you are firm about not going on the trip.  If they ask, I wouldn't use the money for the other wedding as a reason because if circumstances were different, you'd be going with bells on.  No shame in repeating what you already told the dude.

I think for you nothing good can come from attending this wedding.\n\nAs so many others have mentioned, as friends get married the friend group gets pulled in lots of directions.

They will be splitting vacation time and money between their two families and two friend groups and then also their personal time. They will start putting far more money away toward things like a house and if they start a family that will eat up both their time and money.

If that doesn\u2019t show how good of a friend you actually are by sacrificing participating in a tradition you\u2019ve been apart since the start then it\u2019s just them being selfish and unfortunately when we want to bring groups together you can\u2019t prevent people from feeling left out when they aren\u2019t included in the main event and you certainly can\u2019t guilt trip people into being okay with things they just aren\u2019t comfortable with.

It's not a good thing.\n\nI would like to share my story as to why.\n\nI used to have two friends. Let's call them Dana and Emily. We used to roleplay together. For those who don't know what roleplaying is, I suppose can be described very loosely as \"taking turns writing to write a story with someone else.\"\n\nBut at some point, I noticed they were pulling away. I would rationalize it as \"oh, they're talking more because they are roleplaying several scenarios without me. So of course they would talk about that. I wouldn't have liked doing that roleplay scenario either, so it's fine.\"\n\nIt wasn't fine.\n\nAfter that, I wound up being excluded from things a lot. \"Roleplaying with me\" actually ranked lower on one of my former friend's of priorities than \"Watching Critical Role live\". Alone, \"Watching Critical Role live\" would have been fine on its own, coupled with everything else that happened it just felt like another open wound.\n\nFor example, me and one of these former friends, let's say Dana, would be roleplaying while Emily was asleep. Emily woke up in the middle of the night (for them), and Dana with dropped me to write a to Emily because \"I promised Emily I would have a response for them when they woke up.\"\n\nI tried to ask why this was happening in a message to Dana. Let me tell you, getting a response was like pulling teeth. I didn't get a response for a while. If I recall, I even asked on the public server the three of us shared about why I wasn't getting a response. Dana was still posting messages in the public server and replying to Emily, so it's not like Dana wasn't offline. I got snapped at by Emily that \"Dana was busy! Why are you bothering her!\"\n\nWell, no. I didn't know Dana was busy because I wasn't getting a response. After that I finally got a response from Dana. They said that they were roleplaying with Emily more because \"roleplaying with both of you can be a lot sometimes, and roleplaying with Emily is easier, and it's not as mentally exhausting.\"\n\nThis was a fair comment to make, because quite frankly, I wasn't contributing as much as I should have been, putting most of the burden on Dana. I tried to rectify this, I tried to come up with a setting so that I wouldn't have to lean on Dana to think of how to drive the plot as much, take some of that mental load off, you know?\n\nI told both Dana and Emily of my idea, and to me, they both said \"it sounds interesting,\" so we tried that for a little. That fizzled out a bit because \"I'm just not attached to these characters.\"\n\nAfter that, I just accepted the fact that, at some point, the friendship had pushed me out, and I stopped trying.\n\nIn the end, I believe I just wound up going silent, and didn't make any sort of grand declaration as to why I was leaving/not talking with them anymore. I don't know, it was still hurtful, and I didn't want to hear about the ways we weren't friends anymore. I still don't.\n\nI'm posting this because maybe it's just because of this experience, but that's honestly what I feel like is happening to you.

Both of my siblings also did that with people that were important but they couldn\u2019t possibly add another person to the bridal/grooms party group.", "This happened to me. The separation and exclusion continued over time and made it uncomfortable to be among that friend group. YOU ARE NTA.", "I've also seen similar situations where the college friend group is too big. The compromise would be to pick the closest friend you have in the group to be the best man or a groomsman. Good friends understand and don't get bent out of shape about it.", "Not only that, but it'll be year upon year of them reminiscing about their time as groomsmen (because it sounds like they've bonded pretty strongly over it) and OP being constantly reminded that he was excluded.\n\nDoesn't sound like my idea of a good time.", "Because they have all bonded and now they think of the groomsmen as their friend group and OP is the extra who happened to already be a part of the tradition but isn't really part of the group anymore.", "At least leave one more out, so there would be two non-groomsmen from the friend group. It\u00b4s extremely awful to leave just one of them out.", "YUP. I agree everyone in the bridal part of no-one seems to be the best solution.", "Either the groom or perhaps the bride.

He's spoken about that in other comments and his thoughts on the situation matched with what I would have expected. They're events for all or part of the wedding party. He wouldn't fit in and no invite was expected.\n\nThe issue in this situation isn't that its one of those activities directly. Its that by wanting to invite the other groomsmen who aren't a part of the tradition of that trip, the other guys are turning it into a wedding related activity.\n\nAnd that when OP responded as he did, the other guys responded more in the direction of doubling down than in going \"ugh... he's right.\"\n\nAnd, as I commented elsewhere we don't know what the groom would think of those extra invites. He might like the idea...\n\nOr he might be opposed and want it to stay the original group. He might want it to be a trip where wedding talk is off the table.\n\nIt should also be noted that OP has said he has still been hanging out with the groom. Not clear if they group of five has been hanging out together. But its not like the groom has totally stopped interacting with him personally.", "NTA Yeap, I was sorta in the same situation. My friend asked me to read during the mass ( it was a Catholic wedding) It was great actually got invited to all the pre-wedding stuff but didn\u2019t have to wear a bridesmaid dress! Lol", "Right? There are so many ways to be involved in a wedding without it turning into the final scene of 27 dresses.", "I\u2019m giving the groom MASSIVE amounts of side-eye.

But they don\u2019t want to think that they\u2019re being mean to OP, so they make it about him not being understanding enough, when he\u2019s already been extremely understanding.", "Couldn\u2019t agree more. OP should have a talk with his friends since they\u2019re acting like they have no clue. So no one has the narrative that\u2019s he\u2019s not coming because he resents not being a groomsman. As OPs been super understanding to start with and rather than one of them thinking he\u2019s not a good friend or isn\u2019t being understanding enough would just ruin OPs image without him putting out such a narrative.", "They are not clueless they know what they are doing and are trying to pass off the guilt and gas light OP as being the inconsiderate one in the group.", "The point is that the annual football trip is about the friendship group, not the wedding. It's specifically *not* an event planned for the groom, and the other guys want to turn it into one. It would be one thing if the other guys planned a separate bachelor event and invited OP, despite him not being a groomsman, but that's not what is happening here.", "Its about the ratio, five groomsmen and 15 homies is different than 7groomsmen and 1 homie. \n\nI recently went to a wedding of a close friend where they had had a combination bachelorette/bachelor weekend trip to a different city.

But any way it plays out, there is a potential that it could get brought up.\n\nEssentially, even if you don't want to talk about this until some time after the wedding is over, circumstances may force your hand.\n\nSpending some time thinking about how you feel and what you would want to say may not be a bad idea. If it does come up, you won't be completely caught cold.\n\nAnd even if you never end up talking about it with him, the process itself may also help you to resolve things in your own mind.", "Don't wait.

The three of them didn't have a choice in who was chosen as groomsmen, and it seems like they were hoping it wouldn't hurt their dynamic. I don't think this lifelong friendship should be discarded over something like this, but I agree this needs to be talked out. OP is NTA for not wanting to go, but I hope he just takes a break this year, not a break forever from such important friends.", "Alternatively, ops engaged friend is unaware he\u2019s acting like an asshat by asking all but one friend after his fianc\u00e9 said \u201cI have seven bridesmaids, find 7 groomsmen\u201d", "for real, losing friends like that can be genuinely heartbreaking, and people don\u2019t talk about that enough", "Or just have 7 on one side and 8 on the other. The \u201crules\u201d are all made up, anyway.", "Yeah, I have 4 bridesmaids and have absolutely no idea who else I\u2019d ask.", "Right?! I agree with you 100%. If there's a chance someone you're close to would be hurt or upset by being excluded, is it worth it in the long run?", "THIS IS THE WAY. No I'm kidding because I know many people who'd think differently and still make sure no one is hurt by feeling excluded. But I think your approach makes 100% sense.", "Yeah, that's my take here too.\n\nAs someone who spent WAY too much time hanging out with a group of \"friends\" before I saw the truth, I hope OP figures out if this is a group of FRIENDS or a group of people who put up with him hanging around.", "They are trying to change the group dynamic. And they don\u2019t really want OP there. They just want to stop feeling guilty. Honestly, it would be kinder if they just told him to fuck off for good. Instead they keep twisting the knife in. If I were OP, I\u2019d start ghosting them all. NTA.", "Happened to me too almost 20 years ago, and it still hurts to think about. Basically lost a whole friend group over night.", "I think that's what RichAstronaut meant.\n\nThey didn't mean \"You should already have known what status you had in the group, and obviously it wasn't as groomsman\". \n\nThey meant \"because of this event you should now be aware of where you stand in the group.\"\n\nSo basically what you said.  It's a surprise, but now you know.", "Isn\u2019t the person you replied to saying that they should realize where they stand *now*? Like, they\u2019ve kinda shown that they really don\u2019t care about OP and OP should really consider what all this means for the future of their group. I don\u2019t think they were implying that OP should\u2019ve somehow known to begin with", "Hey Emerald, long time to no-see. No hard feelings.   \n\n\nI agree, this is why traditional wedding parties and bridesmaids/groomsmen can really be shitty. It forces people to rank their friends and that is an unnatural process - especially if you are limited by the number of bridesmaids (if the wife has 4 BMs, then in a lot of cases - it's customary to match with 4 GMs - not always but people can be sticklers for it).   \n\n\nOPs feelings were hurt, which is understandable and it isn't an onus on him to \"know where he stands within the group\" - those are his boys and it isn't natural to constantly evaluate who is better friends with who.   \n\n\nOPs been more than reasonable about it and I don't see it entirely different if it was his friends all wanting to bring their partners but OP didn't have one. You wouldn't want to be the odd man out and he's being more than accommodating without making a big deal and making it about him.", "I dodged having a fake friend group in university because I could sense that they didn't actually like me but it was just opportunistic to have me around to split bills or whatever pity project they were invested in cause I never really hang out with anyone at my uni. Which was a choice because I never vibed with them. I had two good friends but different unis .", "My boyfriend cousin had a huge wedding party. 10 on each side, there were more people in the friend group that weren\u2019t in the parties but still part of the wedding. So like there were ushers and something else for them to still be involved. All those extra people were also invited to all the pre wedding events. As far as I could tell everyone seemed happy with it but idk I feel like it\u2019s hard not to take those things personal", "Same with me, I was the one in my friend group that never really belonged. I overlooked a lot of minor things but eventually they just all added up and became too much. Final straw was one year that was particularly bad for me, a lot of bad stuff happened and I became really withdrawn and basically dropped off the earth, and none of them asked what was wrong or even noticed. I was the one that everyone came to with their problems but when I was the one that needed it none of them stepped up. Its been over ten years and still hurts.", "Same with my high school friends that then were close college friends. Even lived with one for awhile when he got with a mutual friend and then they got married. I wasn't invited to any of their weddings. I realized I wasn't actually a good friend of theirs, i was just someone they didn't have a problem inviting a long to stuff. \n\nI just killed the friendships then, nothing dramatic just stopped checking in. Getting together when in town etc. Known these people since we were kids, and then nothing. Sucks but oh well.", "Happened to me. I was given a lie it was about finances but I was the only one not invited in the group, yet I had been the first one to congratulate them after the proposal occurred at an event I hosted where I had spoke to the guy and said I was ok with him asking there because I thought we all were friends.  Life happens.  I hope OP realizes where he stands and treats them accordingly.", "Ouch. Not being in the wedding party is minor (IMO) but not being invited at all would really sting.", "Happened to me too, my best friend of 16 years got engaged had to find out through fb. She had regular in that last year parties at her place (1 a month) and never invited me saying it was work colleagues only or I would only get  bored(not sure why that mattered). I would have thought the now fiancee would want me there when he proposed at one of the parties being her bff. I guess it was all one sided we both drifted apart slowly after that and I found new friends who always invite me even if they think I may not like it.", "You are TA that this comment needs :)", "got us a madlad here, this", "The other", "I got married at the courthouse because I don't like being the center of attention and didn't want to deal with this kind of garbage lol", "Yeah, at least OP won't have to listen to him crying about his divorce.", "Seriously!", "Very creepy and weird. I wish I was making that up, but unfortunately that was a direct quote. I witnessed a lot of bullshit in my 20s when it came to weddings/wedding events, that when it came time for me to get married I kept it as simple and lowkey as I could.", "Definitely a blessing in disguise. She completely changed her personality after getting engaged/married to fit what she thought her husband wanted. I personally don\u2019t want friends who aren\u2019t confident enough to truly be themselves past 30.", "This is true and if it pans out like that then he knows to RSVP \u201cno\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been through a similar situation too and kept my upset to myself and wish I had known because at least I wouldn\u2019t have had to attend what was supposed to be a joyous occasion feeling like unwanted shit. Or paid so much to attend or bought them a gift. Ten years on I\u2019ve seen my former close friend 4 times, we live 8 minutes walk from each other.", "14? So his seven and her seven? Based on everyone\u2019s behavior as you describe here, maybe your friend figured you were the most go with the flow, and any of the other guys would be butt hurt and emotionally manipulative? Obviously assuming the college bros are like the elementary bros", "Honestly? This is so sad! I don't wanna project my traumatic past onto you or something but the fact that you don't even find it strange raised some bells.\nWhy do you feel it is not strange for you to be excluded? If Brandon really was your friend he would have not only explained why you can't be officially groomsmen, but he would have made sure to include you anyway. There would be ways to include you without making you feel the odd one out. \nI was bullied and excluded for most of my childhood and teenage years. After years of being seen as expendable and only kind of tolerated but not actively wanted in social groups, I too thought it wasn't strange when I wasn't included in group events....", "It makes sense that you wouldn\u2019t want to feel like an outsider there either. But why not have events that aren\u2019t so \u201cexactly the people in the wedding party\u201d cliquish? Especially when the groom knows he\u2019s leaving someone out. Those organizing these events get to pick what events to have and how to have them; they\u2019re not bound to fill only those roles, or that labeled subset, irrespective of the effect on others. And if their choice is \u201cI want wedding-party-only events, because I want them to bond, and it all makes for a great story of our wedding and great wedding-related pictures\u201d then they also need to be aware of the consequences in constructing that.\n\nUltimately I don\u2019t want to suggest you should be more offended, though.", "You should, this interaction basically shows you're being phased out of the group.", "Yeah, the silence here speaks volumes.", "Yes. It worries me that the friend went straight to accusing OP of being resentful instead of hurt. It\u2019s okay to be hurt and hurt is not the same as resentful or bitter.", "> Guess what I did before I asked anyone else to be a groomsmen, I FUCKING CALLED THEM AND TALKED TO THEM.\n\nThis indeed!! I had a good friend but i saw our ways changing and imo it felt like he was cooping himself up in his room resulting in not talking about life with us, causing a sort of rift.\n\nIt took courage but i spoke to him, he saw what we meant and he made changes... Now we are great friends! We both remember the conversation as a hard point in our life's.. but it really strengthened our bond.", "I also think the fact that it's 2 guys not being invited to be groomsmen helps here - it's not one guy being excluded, like with op. I don't understand how the groom in this situation doesn't know he's being rude to op? Or none of his friends have worked out why he doesn't like this situation.", "Yes! I\u2019ve had friends that I consider even less close for only 5 years and they told me why they couldn\u2019t include me as a bridesmaid when I didn\u2019t even expect it. It his normal among close friends", "They want to keep the status quo but don\u2019t care to question why he was excluded? This needs to be fully flushed out not sat on for a year and revisited later.", "They feel guilty and want to assuage that guilt. That is the only they are mad. They don\u2019t really want him there.", "It could easily be they only want him to go because him not going ruins the surprise other other guys coming.", "They want him there, but also want to bring the other groomsmen. They sound more upset that OP is saying No to that--more upset that he's making them choose between those other guys and him for this particular event. \n\nThey upset because OP's shining a light on the consequences of previous choices they made. They're upset because he's putting some of the emotional work back on to them.", "So true. Had a \"decent\" friends group from elementary -high school. Hung out all the time, I'd be throwing parties left and right for people's bdays and whatnot. Ended up moving 1/2 hour from home after college, now they were all throwing parties and not inviting me. Or telling me I lived too far away to meet up. It's been over 10 years, and I still haven't really recovered. Have a hard time trusting people and mostly keep \"friends\" at arms length. The new distance didn't even make that much of a difference, I was actually CLOSER to some people after the move.", "True. Or make OP an usher, perhaps? Then he could still participate in wedding party gatherings.\n\nSo many better ways to handle this than they did.", "Thanks! It does for me, we\u2019re not even going to have that big of a wedding anyway. We want to celebrate, but it\u2019s not going to be a huge thing.", "Yeah honestly it kind of is a big deal leaving him out like he was one more person. Just one. He was part of a core friend group why was he amongst all of them left out? \nIt changes their friend group dynamic from all the bros to the best bros/groomsmen + OP who is seemingly one or more levels lower and may have always been.", "Same. Close friends. I wasn\u2019t in the bridal party, OK. Invited on the bachelorette party. I showed up and everyone was wearing the obligatory bride/bridesmaid/MOH shirts and matching pants/shoes. Literally the only one invited that didn\u2019t have an \u201coutfit\u201d. They were all shocked when I left.", "I'm so sorry. Did you ever figure out why? My sis never did :(", "About your pretend friends... They're TA. Real friends wouldn't do that, and I hope you found better friends. \ud83d\ude01", "Ah ok. if so, that does make sense.", "I think you may be right. I may have misinterpreted the comment. I'm going to update accordingly.", "Yeah, looks like they were using you to be their quasi therapist, but certainly weren't willing to be supportive at all in return when you most needed it. I'm sorry. Hugs.", "So they were fine inviting you to a lot of stuff, but not the wedding. I guess you were good enough for the less important stuff, but not for the actual wedding. I'm sorry, but I'm glad you ended those friendships and moved on.", "Some other AH beat me to it though lol", "That is great solution!", "Same! This has stirred a lot of things up for me too. Thing is, I hate leaving people out and could never in good conscience do it to someone else. Humans can be really mean.\n\nOp NTA, but I would consider that the groom should have been a good enough friend to explain to you why he left you out.", "They were probably told why. And even if they questioned it, I understand not putting much pressure for things to change (ie OP to be included in the wedding party) because it is not their wedding, it's the groom's. \n\nThe only A H here is the groom who has had plenty to time to talk to OP about this, and still keeps him in the dark.", "Or just invite him to the wedding party gatherings? Usually there have always been a couple extra people at the ones I have gone to.", "Thats great, as long as you have fun and create some memories :)", "Yes.  The groom really should have had the balls to explain why he didn't have OP in the wedding. There are plenty of scenarios. The bride hates him.... The bride wouldn't let him have another groomsman... Whatever it was.  Since he didn't the hurt feelings are just snow balling.", "That is so shitty. I have a close friend whose wedding I wasn't in, but we all just got shirts for the Bachelorette party that looked the same except foe the bride's, and about half of the people who went on the trip weren't in the wedding. I feel like some people get half their joy around these from being in the \"in\" group and deliberately excluding others.", "Good for you for leaving. That really wasn't cool", "That\u2019s a crazy way to find out and weird that no one told you.", "I did not. But I realized I was lower on the totem pole than I had previously gathered, so there really was no point in staying around.", "I did. When people don't seem to appreciate me for who I am nowadays, I tend to avoid them instead.", "If the other friends know and aren\u2019t telling him or urging the groom to tell him they are AHs too. You don\u2019t sit back and let your friend be hurt/excluded and not react or respond.", "yep. some people love excluding others, i think it makes them feel special or important", "For sure. It lets them say \u201cI\u2019m more important than you.\u201d No. You\u2019re just an AH.", "Girls are mean. Some don\u2019t grow out of it after high school.", "Yeah , I'd have done the same thing."]}
