Your reasons are valid, but there\u2019s no need to justify how you chose to spend your money.", "NTA.\n\nBasically he's mad at you for not needlessly furnishing an apartment you'll leave in few months anyways, which would only result in you wasting money.\n\nHas he even contemplated that you having money saved up is actually directly related to you not wasting money on known to be useless stuff? He sounds jealous of you, and that's not a good look.", "Nta.  Tell him you don't appreciate his attempts to ruin your minimalist decor.  I took would wait until I was somewhere that would be long term before going beyond the basics.", "NTA.  \n\n\n\nTell him \u201cyou may be right.\u201d  and then move on about your life exactly how you want. \n\n\n\nAlso, don\u2019t discuss your finances with him.", "NTA.  Don\u2019t let him dictate how you think you should live.  He can advise but it\u2019s up to you to decide for yourself.", "NTA Unless you're entertaining people, who cares? You have everything you need for the duration of your contract. I hope for your sake you have some towels in the bathroom for your convenience but it's none of your brother's business.", "NTA\n\nMy husband and I recently moved into an apartment, we have a box spring and a mattress that sits on the floor and it'll stay that way. We also have my dad's old mini van seats we use a couch (temporarily) it's YOUR place. Do as you please", "NTA - does this inconvenience him any any way?\n\nI mean i kinda get it if you're inviting him over and he has no place to sit,  but he can just stop coming by in that case or suggest you go somewhere else", "NTA.\n\nWhat furniture **YOU** have in **YOUR** apartment is none of his fucking business.\n\nWhat you do with **YOUR** saved money is none of his business either.", "NTA, why does your brother even care?!", "NAH. is it possible your bro\u2019s problem is that there\u2019s nowhere to sit when he visits?", "Why does your brother care about how you live in your apartment?

NTA.", "Well it started because I initiated a conversation about my apartment and how I was thinking that my parents who own the apartment was encouraging me to buy stuff so that they can buy it of me when I move out but I didn't say the part where they plan to buy the stuff of me. That got him heated and once I realized that I apologized for leaving that part out. It wasn't until after that he started talking about my living conditions and calling me a bum for having so much money and not using it.", "No, he doesn't live with me in the apartment.", "Doesn't really help his case considering it's been only since the start of Sep since I moved in.", "Maybe you've got a point there. Right now I've got $10,000 in my bank account from my time working as a temporary employee at the Census Bureau while he only has $2,000 in his bank account.", "Thanks for your advice, btw I already do have towels. I just didn't mention that because it seemed pretty irrelevant.", "That's the thing though, he doesn't ever come here. He has no reason to after all. It would be a 2 to 3 hour drive just to get here from where he lives to my apartment.", "He's never visited before and never has a reason to. If we wanted see each other I would be the one to come visit.", "Ahhhh I get it now. Would he by any chance be the next to occupy the apartment?\n\n\nIf your parents want to furnish the apartment they are welcome to. Don't buy- they would probably offer a derisory sum for the furniture as you can't take it with you anyway.", "So only for a measly four months, he expects you to live like you owned the place, with everything bought and stuff? Kind off ridiculous expectations on his side.", "NTA tell him he canplease himself and furnish the Appartment but he needs to get it when you leave if it bothers him so much. \n\nYou are ok with what you have right now and aren't spending 1 more cent on anything else you personally don't want or need in that apartment.", "Cat's out of the bag, there you have it. Good ol' jealousy back at it.\n\nJust out curiosity: older or younger brother?", "Back in the day, I had a boyfriend that used a bathrobe as his all in one, all purpose bathroom towel.", "Then he can STFU.", "He probably will but he already knows that once I move out I'm taking all that stuff with me. My parents went to the store to get all that stuff for me but the money came out of my pocket.", "Then that's your explanation. NTA\n\nHe wants you to pay for HIS furniture. He's a huge ah."]}
