It almost sounds like she was gawking at them. My ex once brought his dad and brother to my house and the brother bombarded me with questions about how much my house cost and how I afforded it and how big my salary must be (it's not). It made me really uncomfortable, and I couldn't wait for them to leave. I'm going to go with NTA.", "Let\u2019s take a moment to think if the roles were reversed. \n\nFrom other comments it sounds like OP\u2019s family home is extravagant and Sadie was acting like a tourist, wide-eyed and a bit nosy, asking how much things cost and photographing their home. Imagine it was flipped and someone from wealth visited their partners family home that was modest, maybe even meager. Would it be appropriate for them to be flabbergasted and asking how much their car cost or taking pictures of the inside of the home? I don\u2019t believe so. \n\nIt\u2019s just common courtesy when in another person\u2019s home to respect some common etiquette boundaries.

You didn't say everything about her is wrong, you just gave her a tipp that she doesn't collide with your family so much. This was nice and your cousin is great too to not shame his girlfriend for being how she is, but sometimes you have to tone yourself down in certain settings, we all have to. Doesn't mean we have to change our personality completely, but we don't have to be the main character all day.", "NTA, reading between the lines she was acting like a gauche tourist. She needed a heads up.", "Honestly, I would appreciate it if someone told me all the unwritten rules instead of expecting me to just figure them out. As long as you gave it as an optional information, and as a demand, NTA. But it really depends on your tone", "NTA - you provided data; she used that to make an informed decision on her own.

Were your parents talking shit about her behind her back? So they were negative to her, but not saying anything to her face? Then your family is shit.\n\nShe is from a different family and perhaps culture. If your family cannot understand that, then they are dense and culturally insensitive. People bowing down to your cultural customs without any knowledge is asking a bit much. \n\nThat said, I don't feel that **you** did anything wrong, except of course adding \"our family is really shitty and if I don't tell you these things,  they will hate you, heads up!\".\n\nI don't get your etiquette rules. Don't talk about money or prices. Prices on what? Property? It's super vague to me. \n\nYou did ruin it for Nate,  because he hates the etiquette and the bending to the rules and he found someone that is free and without filter and felt the winds of change blowing, maybe if they got a bit of modern chaos in their life, something could change around there?\n\nBut no. They had a little agent putting everyone in their proper place.\n\nYTA.", "YTA - your family sounds very judgemental.  Sadie shoiuld remain authentic to herself.", "YTA\n\n>. I told him he knows as well as I do that there\u2019s a binary code of conduct in our community and I was giving her the information, because she deserved to have the opportunity to make a better impression than she was\n\nWhat about the impression *you* as a family were making on her? Your family's \"binary etiquette\" is a solely them problem. There's no law anyone has to conform to it, it's not the only way to behave, and if your adult family doesn't understand the implication of living in a society with other individuals , that's on them. You make it sound like a pod person family. \n\n>A few days ago I took her aside while we were getting ready for dinner and laid it out for her.

Yeah, no big deal/s\nSweet hell, if my partner's family member said any of this I'd ask the whole family in front of them if this was true and they needed me to change in order to like me. If the answer is obviously yes, I wouldn't change. I'd just be NC with my partner's family and they could choose whether to continue that relationship or not. But I wouldnt be investing in people who want to dictate how I should talk and about what and how I should behave or be. That's controlling AF, no matter who it comes from. \n\n>The last few days, she has totally chilled out. Everyone has been much warmer and now has positive things to say about her. I thought I\u2019d done a good thing. \n\nYou made her uncomfortable in her own skin enough to completely change her personality. And you think you \"did a good thing\"? You didn't. You just made her wish her holiday was already over so she could leave. And she'll probably want nothing to do with you or your family in the future. Nate seems to be on her side, (good for Nate, he actually loves her as she is) so you probably won't be seeing him around much either. \n\n>He said I had totally ruined the experience of the trip for her by making her feel like she had to act a certain way\n\nYou did. Nate's right. And he's also right about her not dating his family. She's dating him. Your family liking her isn't required. Her fitting in with your family isn't required. All that's required is for her and nate to fit together. The rest of you aren't part of the package. \n\n>We\u2019re now not really speaking. I feel bad that I\u2019ve spoiled the authentic experience for Sadie but at the same time I still feel like she deserved to know what was being said about her. AITA?\n\nNever occurred to you to shut your family up when they were saying negative things about her? Never occurred to you that maybe your family needs to change? No? Then you're definitely the AH and a hypocrite if you expect others to do for you what you yourself (the family in this situation) are not willing to do for them.\n\nSetting specific boundaries in regards to your home/yourself is fine (hey, I'm uncomfortable when money is talked about so I won't participate in conversations about money, and I'd appreciate it if you didn't bring it up\"- that's fine. But it didn't stop just at specific things did it? You gave her a whole list on how to behave, talk, etc)", "Slight ESH except Sadie.\n\nYou started nicely with good intentions when you hinted to in private that she should stop talking about money. That was alright. But telling her to avoid pop-culture references was over the top. That has nothing to do with etiquette but was only your preference. \n\nYour cousin could have hinted to her before where she was rude.\n\nSadie seems to be nice and smart.", "Yta, your family sounds judgmental and not fun. Its sad if anyone wants a warn welcoming they have to fit in a box. \n\nI hope she figures out that its okay to be herself", "That is a tough one. It sounds like you mean well and you tried to communicate the information as tactfully as possible. The question is if it was entirely her choice whether to act upon what you said, as you claim, or she felt pressured to act a certain way, like Nate claims. I think it comes down to how close you are to Sadie. Because you are relatively new acquintences, you are part of the family that she is meeting for the first time, I will go with YTA. She would have found it extremely hard to disregard your comments.\n\nAlso meeting families is a two-way street. You seem to believe Nate's family's opinion on Sadie is more important, but she is also forming an opinion on them. Instead of talking to Sadie, why not talk to your family members and tell them to play nice?", "I think OP's community is the \"old money\" community where over the top enthusiasm, asking about car prices, and taking pictures of material wealth is considered vulgar.  OP was trying to give her clues on how the generationally wealthy behave.\n\nSadie and Nate think it made her uncomfortable and uneasy to behave in a way that was foreign to Sadie's nature.  Fake.\n\nOP may have believed she was doing a kindness, but I think Sadie and Nate are right and OP is the AH.  People should be themselves.  \n\nYTA", "So you said to her, \"Everyone likes you but we want you to change.\"\n\nYTA", "NAH. I think the number of corrections you made were excessive to the point they almost shame your family.\n\nBuuuut I think what you told her was basically using family politics for a good result. You taught her how to play the game better. These conversations are often unpleasant or an imposition, you found a way to keep that part out in your messaging to her.
