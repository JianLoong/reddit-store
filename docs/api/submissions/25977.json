Where there is clearly no other option? And when one is hosting this is a basic understanding of what they are offering? \n\nYour child didn't need to still learn about working on manners.

Point being, at that age kids can have sticky fingers and it\u2019s not that deep. \n\nAs we crossed the street, I showed my Mom and she made me go into the store, confess to taking, and return. She was a tremendous Mom and wanted to seize the teachable moment to do the right thing. I remember standing behind the counter, too short to see over it, and sheepishly confessing. The saleswoman said, \u201cYou know I could call the police and you\u2019d have to go to jail.\u201d  Even though she said it nicely, I was terrified and started crying. To a 5 year old, jail is forever. I could pick the woman out in a lineup today, that\u2019s how well I remember the encounter. \n\nWhat I remember even better? My Mom demanding, \u201cStop! I am trying to teach my 5 year old daughter right from wrong, not have her scarred for life.\u201d She pulled me out of the store, gave me a big hug, and promised to bail me out after putting me in the squad car. Okay, the last part is a lie. But when I think of why  my mother is a fierce warrior, that story comes to mind.

If the bowl looks like a piece of fruit is \"missing\", people will be more likely to treat it as food then if it's arranged such that it looks full. If one person grabs a piece of fruit from the bowl others are likely to follow\n\nI've many times seen someone grab a piece of fruit to eat and then afterwards very awkwardly not known what to do with peel or core.

She's at the house of a family member but not a family member close enough where she can freely take food\n\nLike it isn't like this is a very clear social expectation and she knows to ask but forgot. This is an extremely unclear social expectation to the point that hundreds of people on this thread are incredibly bewildered.
