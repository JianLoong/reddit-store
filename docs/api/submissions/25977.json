Where there is clearly no other option? And when one is hosting this is a basic understanding of what they are offering? \n\nYour child didn't need to still learn about working on manners.

Anyone who tries to bully a child is either insane, an AH or both.", "NTA. His behavior is beyond absurd. Obviously, bullying and threatening a child is awful, and you were right not to tolerate it.\n\nYour kid did nothing wrong. Anyone would assume that food set out at a family barbecue is there for guests to eat. I'd never expect anyone to ask me for food I'd put out. \n\nYour uncle is obviously pissed that you called out his shitty behavior, and everyone agrees with you.

As soon as the wife started calling me, I\u2019d tell her if she contacted me again I\u2019d call the police and report her for harassment! If you think it\u2019s okay to threaten to call the police on a 6 year old, get ready to have it thrown back at you. Then he can mope about that as he hopefully reflects about how it was his own actions that got him here (although I doubt he will).", "yeah lmao feels like an outcast because he is an outcast", "It was a banana, I could maybe get a lolly (but still a huge over reaction) but it was a freaking healthy snack. My family would have told her to eat as much fruit as she wanted if she still felt hungry.\n\nThe only AH in this is the uncle and he is only mopping because he found out the truth, that he isn't as respected as he thought.", "Agreed! In my family, food that's out is assumed to be food for guests. And besides, it's a banana??? Like, they cost 79 cents!! It's not a container of saffron or caviar or something!!", "Not only threatened to call the cops, but if I'm reading it right, actually pretended to do so. Tell your aunt (and your mom, if necessary) that you have no intention of apologizing to a man who bullies a child and says he'll send her to prison for being hungry. NTA. \n\nHas he always acted like this, or could he be suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer's?", ">Now when I host a picnic, I do not expect my guests to ask permission to eat the food\n\nright??? that is why everyone is there! to eat food and anything out is fair game. or should be fair game to eat", "The only thing I can think that MAYBE makes a tiny bit of sense is if the fruit bowl was in the kitchen and the rest of the food was outside so he didn\u2019t consider the fruit bowl to have been \u2018served\u2019 to the gathering. But even then his response was absurd. Just tell the kid nicely that if it\u2019s in the kitchen she should ask first. It\u2019s not difficult and yeah, when you\u2019re hosting an event, some people might get confused or misunderstand arrangements. It happens. Dude needs to deal like a grown up.", "Yep. \u201cHey, Cindy, I saw you grabbed a banana. That\u2019s fine this time, but in the future try to remember to ask first, okay?\u201d Done.", "Food put out at a bbq becomes communal food and can't be stolen.  The daughter did zero wrong. OP should understand that.", "He is 71 and it sounds like early signs of dementia. Anger at little things, lashing out and not dropping the subject, and believing people are stealing from you could be signs: or he could just be an asshat. NTA", "Can you imagine the police do come and he says he wants to press charges for a banana theft by a six year old?", "I certainly don't put out a plate for burchestta and expect my guests to ask, \"Heloise, may I have some bruschetta?\"", "And when I say \u2018tiny\u2019 I mean like smaller than a grain of sand.", "I mean, a banana is like .50 cents, that's an insane thing to be pissed at a kid over. Kids can cause way more accidental destruction than that. Yeah his reaction was insane, even if it was potentially a bit rude of the kiddo (I would argue not though, unless those are solid gold bananas being saved for a recipe)", "NTA.  He did this to himself.  Everyone that left were probably just as sick and tired of his crappy behavior.  It was the straw that broke the camel's back.  They didn't want to be around someone that bullies children, so they left.  It has nothing to do with being PC, it's about decency.  He bullied a child.", "Even so... it's just a banana, and it was out in the open.  It's not like going rummaging in the liquor cabinet.\n\nI don't think this is even about the banana to be honest.", "Kid didn't steal since food left out is communal. OP should realize her kid is 100% innocent.", "My dad started bursting into a rage over nothing. It was a brain tumor.\n\nThat would be one of the only excuses for this behavior.", "Sounds like this has been going on for a while though. Some people are just awful", "Let him try that. If anything it\u2019ll just give the family more incentive to cut him out"]}
