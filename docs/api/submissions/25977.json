Where there is clearly no other option? And when one is hosting this is a basic understanding of what they are offering? \n\nYour child didn't need to still learn about working on manners.

Point being, at that age kids can have sticky fingers and it\u2019s not that deep. \n\nAs we crossed the street, I showed my Mom and she made me go into the store, confess to taking, and return. She was a tremendous Mom and wanted to seize the teachable moment to do the right thing. I remember standing behind the counter, too short to see over it, and sheepishly confessing. The saleswoman said, \u201cYou know I could call the police and you\u2019d have to go to jail.\u201d  Even though she said it nicely, I was terrified and started crying. To a 5 year old, jail is forever. I could pick the woman out in a lineup today, that\u2019s how well I remember the encounter. \n\nWhat I remember even better? My Mom demanding, \u201cStop! I am trying to teach my 5 year old daughter right from wrong, not have her scarred for life.\u201d She pulled me out of the store, gave me a big hug, and promised to bail me out after putting me in the squad car. Okay, the last part is a lie. But when I think of why  my mother is a fierce warrior, that story comes to mind.

He made everyone leave over a banana.\n\nNTA", "OP you're not responsible for the actions of OTHER people. You can't MAKE people do things. \n\nYour uncle really is miserable with himself or his life. Anger is usually a secondary emotion.

I'd make it clear that he swapped his relationship with the family for a single banana \ud83c\udf4c and that I think my little girl is worth at least 100 bananas on her own so here's his change. Goodbye.", "*The communal food was all out on the table and meat was still being prepared, but my daughter had gone into the kitchen and helped herself to a banana from the fruit bowl.

Its an easy obvious Nta", "I'm very much the opposite of politically correct.  I'm right wing, anti-woke culture, and cannot tolerate phoniness and oversensitivity to imagined offense.  However, this guy is out to lunch if he thinks being a callous, hot-headed bully to a little girl who made AT BEST an innocent faux pas is an appropriate response.  It has nothing to do with being PC or not -- it's rude, ugly, and nasty.  He's a massive AH.", "I'm a mean conservative, and this guy is full of crap.  You can be politically incorrect and still be a decent human being.  Especially over a giant non-issue like a six year old versus a fifteen cent banana.", "My Dad is 75. He would get her a plate, offer to peel and cut it up into smaller pieces, and get her a drink! You're right, this guy is just an ahole.", "My dad is 75 and would be the complete opposite.  He'd be asking the child if the banana was enough, and if they wanted anything else.\n\nThe generation excuse is ridiculous.  As a matter of fact, my dad couldn't have cared less about any other kids than his own for years, but he's mellowed as he's grown older, and is now very fond of the neighbour kids.", "Yep. \u201cHey, Cindy, I saw you grabbed a banana. That\u2019s fine this time, but in the future try to remember to ask first.", "How much could a banana cost? Ten dollars?", "I think he considers the fruit bowl his \u2018personal\u2019 food, not the \u2018bbq\u2019 food. But if he felt that strongly about it he should have put it away before the party. Here I suppose it\u2019s considered polite to ask before taking fruit, but I wouldn\u2019t blink if any guests just helped themselves, especially not a child.", "If this is a US culture thing, it's not one I've ever encountered in my decades of being from the US. The guy just wants any excuse to make himself feel big.", "i mean it's a banana. where could it cost? $10?", "In my family any food that's out at bbq is fair game for kids except fingers in icing, a very strict rule w no unpleasant consequences for the guilty as charged.", "Even if the bananas were locked up with a sign that said MY VERY SPECIAL BANANAS, DO NOT TOUCH and the kid jimmied the lock and ate every last one, this is an inappropriate freak out.  Mom would apologize and run to the store for three dollars' worth of bananas and discuss fruit theft with her six year old.  Uncle needs a giant Xanax.", "I dunno if you're from the US or not, but in the States a lot of times fruit is stored and displayed in bowls on a table or counter, but isn't actually meant for everyone that wants it, just the family of the house.", "In my experience in the U.K., fruit bowls are where one stores the fruit. A guest helping themselves uninvited to something from the bowl is the same as helping themself to groceries from a shelf. (Please note I\u2019m not defending this man\u2019s response in any way whatsoever.)", "Not excusing behavior (there isn't an excuse for his overreaction).\n\nBut my implication at reading this was that the BBQ was likely in the backyard, with the food/etc. for the gathering in specific places.  And the fruit bowl/banana was in a \"non-public\" kitchen - not intended for the BBQ/guests.  Sorta like if someone goes into your master bathroom or that room you always keep the door closed when you have guests over.  Presumably they expected people to stay out of the kitchen, and likewise expected people to not take food without asking from said kitchen.\n\nI've known a few people like that, where the invited guests had very limited actual \"guest\" access.  Those are the people no one wants to visit...\n\nSounds like the uncle finally found out what everyone thinks of him.", "YES. This is how you deal with a child eating from somewhere that is not obviously put out for the guests. She is too young to understand \"guest setup\" at the patio table might be separate from \"groceries in the kitchen, including the kitchen fruit bowl\". Not that I would even tell the child that much. If I have guests, they eat a banana if they want one.  \n\nBut this is the absolute maximum drama that should come from this incident. The uncle is an AH.", "Reread the comment you\u2019re responding to. They\u2019re saying that OP is an asshole for exposing the 6 year old to this guy in the first place.", "Me too, never thought of it that way, but that's a 100% correct analysis of the behaviour.", "\"... early signs of dementia.\"\n\nExcept OP said, \"My uncle is a very .. difficult man to get along with... He is very rigid in his beliefs and will make it very clear to you if you have done something to offend him. Once that has happened, there is no chance for redemption regardless of whether you are family, friends, or a stranger.\"\n\nThat means this is not unusual behavior from him and thus it is almost certainly ***not*** dementia. FFS, people being assholes does not automatically = dementia or mental illness or brain tumors. This ain't a weekday soap opera.", "I've known people behave like that all their lives - it sounds like uncle is the same, he has a history of this behavior. A shame for him but he's reaping what he sowed. \n\nAs everyone else left too, it really does sound like he was on his last straw with them. As he should be - bullying a six year old like that is horrible. It was food, that was left out, at an event where people are invited for food.", "I vote for just an asshat. NTA.", "It\u2019s a family party, who asks to eat? It\u2019s right there to be eaten.", "How much could one banana even cost? Nine \u2026 or ten dollars?", "When I was in high school (around 3rd year so 13-14 year olds) a guy stole the teachers banana for a prank, she then phoned the police on him, and he was made to write a letter of apology and replace the banana l\u2026.", "Depends, is the kid black?", "Not American - we\u2019ve always had a fruit bowl, it\u2019s just where the fruit lives in our house. It\u2019s not necessarily \u201cset out\u201d because it\u2019s just where you put fruit.\n\nMy mum goes all out on hosting so there would be a separate arrangement for fruit for guests (displayed nicely Vs thrown in altogether) but there would be no issue with someone helping themselves - other than probably mum being embarrassed that she hadn\u2019t put out enough for guests\u2026\n\nMy sister lives near my parents so my nieces and nephews are over a lot for casual visits, they\u2019ll just grab whatever fruit from the bowl as they pass by (my nephew is obsessed with grapes) and it\u2019s not an issue - mum is thrilled that the kids are a) eating and b) happy to snack on fruit", "r/unexpectedarrested", "Which is not an unreasonable thing for a kid to get confused about.", "Yeah, that\u2019s what would be normal for me, too, but I can imagine someone being a bit different without being totally unreasonable. And obviously the sensible thing to do is to not leave stuff out you don\u2019t want people to eat.", "That must be a regional thing then because a bowl of food in a public area at a party is there to be shared. If it isn\u2019t put it in the pantry.", "Where I live they\u2019re like .48 cents on the pound", "The food was apparently left out in the kitchen, not with the rest of the party food. So it\u2019s not unreasonable for the kid to be confused and also not unreasonable for a host to be thinking that people will only be taking food from the party food area and thus not think about putting everything else away. My point is that in the event of some kind of misunderstanding like what happened here, there is absolutely no need to freak out at the kid. Just calmly and politely explain your personal rule, it\u2019s not a big deal.", "Exactly. Thank you for understanding I was talking about the maximum reasonable response for what was basically a misunderstanding.", "No. But if someone genuinely had an issue for whatever reason, freaking out at the kid was not necessary. Someone is welcome to have kind of odd rules about food in their own home, they\u2019re just not being reasonable if they assume other people will automatically know those rules so anyone who breaks a rule is doing so deliberately.", "While dementia may not be what's going on here, it absolutely can be both explanation and excuse in other cases. Dementia literally changes people's brains; it is impossible to predict exactly how it will affect any given individual.", "Many people with dementia begin to exhibit aggression and antisocial behavior and it IS an excuse because they can\u2019t help it. \n\nYour relative was not one of them, fortunately for you.", "No, it reads as someone who has been an asshole for a long time.", "He needs Billy's Anti Banana Disguise from Beverley Hills Cop or I'd shove the banarna up his tailpipe. Yes I spelt it wrong on purpose to emphasise the correct pronunciation.", "Plus it\u2019s a single fucking banana, lmao. Currently 17 cents for a banana at Target, which is also a hell of a lot cheaper than anything else she could have eaten at the bbq. Unless it was the last banana on earth, it\u2019s just a control thing.", "That's how our fruit bowl is, and I'm Aussie.  The expectation would be that you would ask, just like you would ask to get something out of the pantry.  It's not party food, it's normal groceries.  But if a young child took a banana without asking, I probably wouldn't blink an eye.", "Adding to this: it wouldn't hurt for him to be checked out by a doctor.", "Right? The cousin even said the uncle was lucky he didn't try that with anyone else because OP is still polite with him.\n\nThat still implies everybody else is sick of uncle's recurring shitty behaviour. \n\nDon't know why people are so hung up on trying to explain shitty behavior with medical conditions.  Maybe they need to delude themselves because the truth, that some people are just awful assholes, is too depressing to face.", "Good thing this shows no damn sign of being dementia then. This is not a change of behavior, so it's extremely unlikely to be dementia.", "True.  My grandmother was the most loving, kind person.  Once dementia hit, she became very negative and critical, and would say things she would never have said before.  It's difficult to be around her now because we don't want to remember her this way.  We want to remember her the way she was for her first 90 years.", "Or call Timmy 'banana' Johnson", "I didn't say there was any sign of that in the post. I was responding to a person who was ill-informed about dementia."]}
