Uncle held a family BBQ. Child selected a banana from a bowl of fruit at said BBQ. Uncle lost his shit? WTF is wrong with this guy?! OP, NTA. Continue to stand up for your child against bullies like him. Also, never see him again. He's already shown you who he is.", "NTA.  Brava for starting an epic FAFO chain reaction!", "Maybe you can't expect people of his generation to be \"PC.\" This has nothing to do with being PC this has to do with being a decent and sane person.\n\nHe doesn't FEEL like an outcast. He IS an outcast. And it's all of his own making.\n\nYou never have to go back to his house. You win.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, & it was perfectly normal for yr daughter to take the banana. She did not demonstrate any lack of manners at all. You guys the invitees have to ask permission every time you grab a chip from a bowl?  Sounds like a very weird BBQ. You said what all your family has been biting their tongues not to say forever. You are the HERO. & uncle reached the FAFO part of his life. Let the mofo mope.", "Good for you!  Don\u2019t apologize because you have nothing to apologize for.  It takes a miserable and very small man to humiliate a child.  I would block the uncle and aunt then just let them fade away.\n\nDefinitely NTA", "NTA.\n\nWas your uncle high? He shouted at a child for taking a banana? What? And then threatened to call the cops? No, you are not in the wrong and I honestly think you need to cut him out of your life along with your aunt.", "NTA Your daughter ate a banana at a family BBQ. Now when I host a picnic, I do not expect my guests to ask permission to eat the food. As a matter of fact, I'd be mortified if they did. I have no idea what's wrong with you uncle but he's going to die a lonely old man unless he gets his head out of his rear end. You did not cause a mass exodus from the BBQ, your inhospitable, hostile uncle did that all by himself. Kudos for you for remaining gracious and polite despite his venomous attack on your child. And shame on your aunt for trying to normalize his nastiness.", "Sorry, am I to understand that there was a fruit bowl, like a serving bowl of cut up fruit or something, out for guests? And if someone wants some of this serving dish fruit then they have to ask permission?\n\nDo they have to ask the host if they are permitted to use the restroom? Where there is clearly no other option? And when one is hosting this is a basic understanding of what they are offering? \n\nYour child didn't need to still learn about working on manners. Your kid literally behaved squarely within the social expectations of what one does as a guest at a party where there is clearly communal food set out. How absolutely weird that this is not the norm. \n\nThen to chastise, threaten, and terrify a child who clearly has a more nuanced understanding of socially acceptable behavior. Your uncle is trash and I love your cousin for saying more and, by sharing her feelings in solidarity, giving courage to just about every other family member he's probably been a monster to for them to show him (by their actions of leaving) what they really think of him. \n\nAnd look at it this way, now there's no one there who could possibly \"steal\" his oddly displayed personal stash of fruit.

Accusing a six year old of being a thief for having a banana at a relatives house is pure absurdity. I\u2019m sorry your daughter had this experience, that is not okay. I would cut all contact with them personally.", "NTA. you\u2019re stronger than I could ever be. I\u2019d have sat there holding my child and let the cops come and see who really is gonna be the issue, or if he was just lying have thrown him a dollar for the banana. it\u2019s a fucking BBQ\u2026 what? why is there food there if not to be eaten?", ">She has also told me that he has been moping ever since because he feels like an outcast in the family, and that I *shouldn't have been so harsh.*\n\nOh the fucking IRONY. \n\nNTA.

My reaction would\u2019ve been to choke that MF", "NTA, why would you have fruit out in a bowl if it was not to be eaten.  Rub his face in it, go online and search wholesale restaurant foods.  You can send him about 140 lbs. of bananas for around $150.", "NTA. I don't see how \"being PC\" has anything to do with this. He blew up at your kid for a minor infraction. Heck, he was the one that told you that you, yr husband, and kid were no longer welcome!\n\nThe fact that all those people left proves that they all felt as you had, but did not have the nerve to speak up before. And they all confirmed you were not too harsh!\n\nSounds like you're free from having to visit him again at least. If others want to make peace with him that's their business. But you have nothing to apologize for.\n\nExpecting your family to treat you with decency and respect is not \"being PC.\" The fact is, the uncle sounds like a big bully. If he doesn't want to accept the consequences of being a bully, that's his problem.", "NTA - He\u2019s expecting a child to have manners he can\u2019t summon a modicum of. If he\u2019s old enough to understand right and wrong, hes old enough to understand he\u2019s being an asshole. Tell your aunt this isn\u2019t about being PC it\u2019s about being a decent human being. You left, you didn\u2019t invite anyone along for the ride, they chose to leave after. If he feels embarrassed in his own home he can take comfort in the fact there won\u2019t be any guests over in the future for a repeat situation. \n\n\nGood for you for having a back bone. Old folks don\u2019t get a pass to be mean cause they\u2019re old.", "NTA.  If it were out in the open, I would think the fruit bowl was fair game at a barbecue, an eating event.  It is completely reasonable for her to think she could eat the banana, even if it were tucked away, since she's 6.  Who threatens to call the police over a 6 year old taking a banana.", "NTA you and your cousin were absolutely right in what you said. Anyone who tries to bully a child is either insane, an AH or both.", "NTA. His behavior is beyond absurd. Obviously, bullying and threatening a child is awful, and you were right not to tolerate it.\n\nYour kid did nothing wrong. Anyone would assume that food set out at a family barbecue is there for guests to eat. I'd never expect anyone to ask me for food I'd put out. \n\nYour uncle is obviously pissed that you called out his shitty behavior, and everyone agrees with you. He's likely unaware that he's actually sad, because men of older generations were taught only to express anger.", "NTA. Let the bully sulk. I would cut him out of your life permanently.", "NTA. Sure, it\u2019s one thing to make this a teaching moment that you don\u2019t take without asking, but this uncle was excessively ragey\u2026 all over a banana.  \n\nYou didn\u2019t cause others to leave. They chose to, when they saw this be the final straw. Your uncle did this to himself.", "Politically correct my ass.  That idiot is a bully and downright despicable.  Be proud you stood up for your daughter.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You can teach your six year old daughter to ask for a snack from family members without terrorizing her and saying she belongs to rot in jail. And from the sounds of it, everything you said to your uncle sounds completely true.", "He\u2019s moping around because he knows that he is at fault for how he spoke to and treated a 6 y/o for taking a banana from a fruit bowl.  All of you were at his place for a barbecue!  Food was the main reason for the gathering.  This man has a definite screw loose.  He so over the top reacted to a little girl eating a banana, I would never go near him if it were me.  Your interaction with his craziness did not ruin the party.  You were the catalyst that everyone else was waiting for to leave his home.  You\u2019re NTA and if it were me I\u2019d call uncle\u2019s wife and tell her she needs to get him some psychiatric help or they will never see you again.", "NTA - this dude chose to bully your kid in front of everyone then asked you to leave. Man humiliated himself", "NTA. You stood up for your kid, that's all. It's not like you encouraged other family members to leave. They left of their own volition, and you're not responsible for that.", "NTA your Uncle is the asshole.  Your aunt/uncles wife is also the asshole for standing up for him.", "NTA. He was going to become an outcast the moment one of his guests decided to show some backbone. The reason this took a while was because nobody wanted to be the first to rock the boat.", "NTA.  It's too bad he's old, but then again it's even more too bad he got this old without anyone ever calling him out for being an unacceptable asshole.", "Thank you for your comment, the oddly displayed personal stash of fruit made me laugh.\n\nThe communal food was all out on the table and meat was still being prepared, but my daughter had gone into the kitchen and helped herself to a banana from the fruit bowl. This is absolutely no issue in our home or in a close relatives home, but just do think she should have probably asked before going to the kitchen and helping herself.\n\nThat being said, his behaviour was so over the top and I do feel vindicated now seeing all these comments.", "For some people, exerting any amount of thought, consideration, or self-control is \"being PC.\" They believe that only an immediate, knee-jerk reaction is authentic. Being thoughtful or considerate is fake.\n\nIt inoculates them from any risk of self-improvement. They are just their own worst impulses forever."]}
