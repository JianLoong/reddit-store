Regardless, all seven of us are close friends. We all live in the same student-heavy area of our university town, and my house is a five-minute walk from their place.\n\n\r  \nOur final exams ended last week, and my faculty had a big formal event planned on Saturday night (basically a party where you wear formalwear with drinks and live music). We had decided that we would all meet at the house which four of my friends shared, and then get two Ubers to a restaurant near the venue. I suggested that we buy some champagne to drink at my friends\u2019 house before we went to the restaurant, and everyone agreed with the idea. My friend Chloe (one of the four who share the house) and I went to the shop to buy two bottles on Saturday morning, and kept it in their fridge. I paid, and everyone else transferred me their share of the cost. We agreed that we would meet at half past six that evening and get cabs at 7.\n\n\r  \nI was getting ready when I got a message through on our group chat asking when I was coming over. I said half six (it was about quarter past) and one Chloe\u2019s housemates, Dom, messaged that they were going to open the champagne so to get there quickly. I messaged back to wait for me, and they said ok. I quickly finished getting ready and headed to their house. When I got there, they thrust a glass of champagne in my hand and said cheers, and all seemed in good spirits. I was evidently the last person to arrive (was before 6:30) and I immediately clocked that everyone\u2019s glasses were half empty. I asked when they opened it, and they said that they had opened it ten minutes ago, but not to worry as they had saved me a glass. I was pretty upset by this, and kind of snapped back, asking why they couldn\u2019t have just waited.\n\n\r  \nI was pretty upset during dinner, and I think they could tell. Some of them were apologetic, but a couple of them insisted that they didn\u2019t do anything wrong as they had saved me a glass and paid me the money for their share already. I said that the point of buying champagne was opening it together and toasting, not just having the drink itself, and the first bit was what I had missed out on.

Everyone\u2019s focusing on the fact that you got pissed, and not on the fact that it was your idea, there was an agreed time and they did the toast early without you for no good reason. Also sounds like they waited for everyone else to get there before they opened it, not like they opened it while they were getting ready because they thought it was no big deal.", "I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with everyone here but i\u2019m going with NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re the one that suggested getting the champagne. You\u2019re the one that made the effort to go out and get it. You made it clear that you would\narrive for 6:30 which was acknowledged by everyone. Yet they contact you ahead of schedule telling you to rush because they can\u2019t stick to the original plan?\n\nI\u2019m going with NTA and you should be upset", ">the point of buying champagne was opening it together and toasting,\n\nExactly. The point was the social aspect of celebrating the end of a collective endeavour. \n\n NTA, you're right to be upset. (It was also your idea and you bought it!)", "NTA. They're not huge assholes either, but they're still the assholes. This is not a hill to die on though and you'd need to determine for yourself if this behavior is a pattern or problematic going forward.\n\nTo all the YTA commenters, IT'S NOT ACTUALLY ABOUT THE CHAMPAGNE!\n\nThe big issue here is that they placed their own impatience over the value of sharing with you. There was a set time and they didn't wait for that time. I'd be annoyed too. And I would be doubly frustrated if I told them it wasn't cool to not wait for me and then they all invalidated my feelings about it. THAT is why you were sour the rest of the night.\n\n  \n\n\nSide story: in HS, my English teacher ordered us a cake to share during lunch time to celebrate finishing our final presentations. There are 2 sections of the class. I'm in study hall when another student in my section says they got a text that the other English section is eating the cake right now because there was a substitute teacher and they convinced them it was okay. So we ask our study hall teacher to go to the English classroom.\n\nWhen we get there, everyone has eaten cake, some took obnoxiously large slices/seconds and there was only a small bit left, enough for us remaining to have a small slice. I, like you, pointed out we were supposed to wait for lunch so everyone could be here. My friends in that section said \"who cares, you got a slice\". And I'm arguing saying \"it's the principle\" and they all just roll their eyes and accuse me of making a big deal out of it because \"I still got cake\".\n\nAnyway, I ended up dropping those friends because I noticed over time a pattern of things like that where I didn't feel personally valued or like we shared the same values.", "NAH- it\u2019s just champagne to them and it was a champagne toast to you to celebrate something I important so I understand you feeling a type of way, but also it\u2019s a small misunderstanding. Let them know you just had a different emotional expectation of the champagne as opposed to it just being champagne to drink. I don\u2019t think your feelings are unreasonable, but just pouting won\u2019t feel any better.", "E S H (edit actually NTA). They should have waited for you, but you're making too much of it. Let it go and communicate clearly next time - your friends don't seem to be able to figure these things out for themselves.", "OP I think you're being real unfair here. I can understand a bit that you might get mad that they didn't wait for you, but to be mad at them all the way through dinner and the rest of the night? You understand you quite literally ruined the evening for your friends because of this.\n\nOP try to see this from the perspective of your friends. They wait for you and pour you a glass. You get upset with them and then you make it quite evident. Now if you were these friends, would you continue inviting this person out for events or would you be cognisant in the future that this person has the capacity to be angry for long periods at a time over little issues.\n\nEdit: YTA btw", "I wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say that you\u2019re TA, but you definitely overreacted. Some things in life just aren\u2019t that serious, and the \u201cproper\u201d way to consume alcohol is one of them.", "NTA\n\nThey could\u2019ve had a glass of ordinary wine while they waited. You arranged it and then missed the toast even though you were on time and they knew you were on the way because they were rude. The only way I can see blame being with you is if you are always late and unreliable and were late again for the drinks.", "What exactly was the issue? You missed the bottle being opened? You had 2 bottles. Were they both gone by the time you arrived?\n\nSince the actual point of champagne is to drink it... it appears you were needlessly upset & may have soured the mood of the evening for everyone. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nWell\u2026 if this is not just the embodiment of 1st world problems. You are upset that you didnt see a cork go pop. You still got to enjoy a little bit of the bubbley and had nice dinner.", "YTA - So you didn't get to see the bottle go \"pop\", why would you let that ruin your evening.  Sounds petty.", "[deleted]", "YTA. What a wild thing to be so upset over. Was it worth ruining the whole evening for everyone?

This wasn\u2019t worth ruining the night over it.", "INFO: did they know you wanted them to wait to open the champagne until you got there?", "Torn between two judgements but I'll go NAH. Seems like more of a miscommunication \u2013 I very much believe that champagne is more about the drinking than the toasting, and you clearly disagree, but it doesn't seem like your friends realised that the toast was the focus in your mind. When I was a student (and even now, 20 years later, tbf) I would have been more concerned that I didn't get my fair share! Hopefully everyone involved can just treat it as water under the bridge?", "YTA. You were the last to arrive. You may have missed the toast, but you got a glass of champagne and then sulked for missing a toast\u2026 which you won\u2019t remember in 10 years.", "YTA i get it you wanted the big toast moment but they clearly didn't *realise* that, its not like they were trying to hide it. They obviously thought you meant to save you a glass. Its a miscommunication no need to be so angry.", "YTA you created a problem out of nothing", "YTA you didn't get to pop the bottle so you pouted like a spoiled brat at dinner souring the night.

They decided that didn't matter, and handed her a glass while she missed out on the entire event of popping the bottle and doing the \"cheers\" NTA OP, I would feel bad too. It was your idea, and you got left out", "You summed it up. NAH for me too. I think it\u2019s a bit much for everyone to be calling OP TA - champagne was her idea so of course she felt emotionally invested and unfortunately seems to have attributed more significance to it than her friends did. And the point was to celebrate so I suppose her friends could have just waited. \n\nBut OP you do need to figure out how to put your feelings into perspective in a situation where the other party isn\u2019t being malicious, or you will end up feeling victimised all the time for the rest of your adult life. It\u2019s not really worth it", "You should reread his post, they didn't wait for him, they purposely started early without giving him enough warning. That is what set the mood for the evening, these friends choose to exclude one of their group for a fairly important social event that he put into motion.", "Per OP the text exchange was:\n\nFriend: \"we're thinking of cracking the bubbly.\"\n\nOP: \"wait for me.\"\n\nWhat could OP have said more clearly?", ">We agreed that we would meet at half past six\n\n>I was evidently the last person to arrive (was before 6:30)", "she was literally on time too NTA", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I missed that", "Except the evening was about finishing final exams & attending a formal celebration, not a bottle of champagne. You can enjoy champagne whenever you want but you only had one chance to experience the spirit of evening.", "Yep. Anything less than 11 years and you don\u2019t have reason or right to be upset. \nGood lord. What I\u2019m saying is that the incident in question is minor in the grand scheme of things. Being that mad isn\u2019t worth it because you\u2019re missing out on other things that could be happening around you that are far better. Yet your sulking keeps you from enjoying it.", "Then definitely NTA. I agree with you that the popping of the champagne is the best part.", "That's awful! It's not box wine!b", "Isn't the point that this was champagne bought specifically bought to celebrate a shared special occasion?\n\nOtherwise, totally agree on champers as a good thing to sit in the yard and sup on as the sun goes down on a quiet afternoon.", "The point, to OP, of *that champagne* was not just to be drunk.  It was a celebration.\n\nI'm all for every day bubbly, but probably not the thread to be pedantic about that point in.", "OP wrote:\n\n>I messaged back to wait for me, and they said ok. \n\nWhether or not they knew her exact reasons, OP explicitly asked them to wait and they didn't. They started early. It doesn't take mind reading abilities to know OP didn't want them to start without her.", "But then why is it YTA rather than ESH? You\u2019re saying OP is the AH for getting pissed at her friends for being assholes", "Nothing like being told that you're wrong for feeling upset about something even though you're not wrong about the situation. Her friends were wrong to not wait for her, and the least they could've done was apologize to her for it.", "I was so mad. This man\u2019s gf spends all this money and he\u2019s a huge dick about me buying glasses. I honestly just gave up and was like whatever. \n\nBut the cardboard cups ruin the whole point of the bubbles!! It just tasted like a normal Chardonnay.", "Exactly. That was the point for her for this occasion, nothing wrong with that! \n\nI dont get how people think you can *only* drink champs on special occasions and a celebratory beverage. Have they never been to a brunch?", "The point was actually the special occasion not the bottle of champagne. \n\nPeople can celebrate with champagne or drink champagne on a random Tuesday. The question is what is the actual point. On a random Tuesday, maybe it\u2019s just about the champagne. At a special event, it\u2019s about the event not the champagne. \n\nThe point was finishing final exams & a formal event to celebrate. Those things would have happened with or without champagne.\n\neta \u2014 in this case OP had champagne. Just missed the opening of the bottle. Hardy worth ruining a evening of celebration.", "Apparently! \n\nAll the downvotes for just saying I like to drink champagne for any old non special reason. Who knew!", "Wait for them to do what? Finish the drinks or open the bottle? OP assumed and learned why it\u2019s not smart to do that.", "Well. I don't know why you spoiled those cups with the wet stuff. The drink comes in a glass already (usually a line I use with a beer but hey, if he's got the champagne budget for it.. ?).\n\nSounds like it may have made things more enjoyable for you, too, after the first \"glass\" or two?", "Yeah. But I don't go standing up in a group to toast a shared accomplishments at most brunches. I also don't have to coordinate purchase and shared payment for it.\n\nTime and place for each - OP didn't pick the audience to share the pop and fizz and cheering moment - there are way more times to stand around in a kitchen with wine than there are to mark milestones - reckon OP may have been disappointed but feel like the others didn't realise they missed a chance to share the other experience. \n\nAlso, students and the relative value of bottles of actual champers - it's probably a more significant financial outlay for them than for my cheerful mimosa!", "Thanks for explaining - seems the champagne marketing machine has succeeded to different extents in different places - I mean, it's about winning a race, launching a boat, toasting good health... popping the champers is the special garnish on the side with no sense of celebration or excitement beyond being a means to share a pricey beverage around.\n\nFollowing your logic, people can do all sorts of things with cake.\n\nIt's tasty and great to eat for enjoyment or could have symbolic value to mark a celebration.\n\nIf helpful wedding guests decide to jump in early, cut the cake, start eating it and keep some slices aside for the bride and groom, everyone's happy because they get to eat cake but there might be slight off-note to the celebrations for the people who organised the cake being there... it's just mismatched priorities, really.\n\nGetting handed a saved glass of bubbles vs the exhilaration of the pop of the cork in good company - it's a cultural mismatch, where mutual disbelief that the other pov misses the point of the moment.", "It seems more like they did share her vision, just did it without her being present.", "You're missing the point", "Arguing with the crowd in AITA is a great way to get downvotes lol.  Just the nature of this sub.", ">Dom: Ellie, when are you getting here? Tom and Priya are here so we might crack open the bubbly\n\n>Me: I'll be less than ten - wait for me!\n\n\"Wait for me\" before you crack open the bubbly. Her friends were really inconsiderate here.", "Im not saying its not - I was simply pointing out that champagne isnt *only* for special occasions.", "Im not - OP said in the comment I replied to that the point of champagne is a shared experience and thats why its so expensive. \n\nIt can be, and thats what she wanted to do and no issues there - but you can just plain old drink champagne too.", "Yup! \n\nI will happily toast to downvotes then for *checks notes* \n\n\u2026Enjoying champagne \ud83e\udd42", "Again, \u201cwait for me\u201d\u2019to do what? To have drinks or to open the bottle. If it was to have drinks, then no problem cause they handed OP a glass as soon as they got it. That was their assumption. If OP said \u201cwait to open the bottle till I get there\u201d then you\u2019d be correct. \n\nOP assumed their friends cared about bottle opening ceremony as much as they did. OPs friends did not care that much about the ceremony. \n\nOP is responsible for letting others know about the value they are putting on a certain act. Otherwise they risked exactly this scenario", "Helpful input - thanks.", "But you are", "Okay, how then?"]}
