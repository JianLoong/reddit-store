{"id": 18070, "submission_id": "13qmogh", "title": "AITA for getting in a bad mood over champagne etiquette?", "selftext": "Background: I (21F) am in my final year of university (in the UK). I have a group of seven close friends who do my course. Four people from this group share a house, while me and our other friends live separately, each with our own housemates. Regardless, all seven of us are close friends. We all live in the same student-heavy area of our university town, and my house is a five-minute walk from their place.\n\nOur final exams ended last week, and my faculty had a big formal event planned on Saturday night (basically a party where you wear formalwear with drinks and live music). We had decided that we would all meet at the house which four of my friends shared, and then get two Ubers to a restaurant near the venue. I suggested that we buy some champagne to drink at my friends\u2019 house before we went to the restaurant, and everyone agreed with the idea. My friend Chloe (one of the four who share the house) and I went to the shop to buy two bottles on Saturday morning, and kept it in their fridge. I paid, and everyone else transferred me their share of the cost. We agreed that we would meet at half past six that evening and get cabs at 7.\n\nI was getting ready when I got a message through on our group chat asking when I was coming over. I said half six (it was about quarter past) and one Chloe\u2019s housemates, Dom, messaged that they were going to open the champagne so to get there quickly. I messaged back to wait for me, and they said ok. I quickly finished getting ready and headed to their house. When I got there, they thrust a glass of champagne in my hand and said cheers, and all seemed in good spirits. I was evidently the last person to arrive (was before 6:30) and I immediately clocked that everyone\u2019s glasses were half empty. I asked when they opened it, and they said that they had opened it ten minutes ago, but not to worry as they had saved me a glass. I was pretty upset by this, and kind of snapped back, asking why they couldn\u2019t have just waited.\n\nI was pretty upset during dinner, and I think they could tell. Some of them were apologetic, but a couple of them insisted that they didn\u2019t do anything wrong as they had saved me a glass and paid me the money for their share already. I said that the point of buying champagne was opening it together and toasting, not just having the drink itself, and the first bit was what I had missed out on. It put me in a bad mood for the rest of the night, and probably soured the evening a little for everyone. AITA for getting in a bad mood over this, or was it justified?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: This got way more responses than I imagined, so thank you everyone for responding. A few points I wanted to clarify and I thought here would be better so they don't get lost in the fray:\n\n**Ruining the night** \\- I think dinner was pretty tense, but we are all very good friends and things were pretty much fine by the time we got to the party, even if I was filled with a sense of righteous indignation. I am still annoyed that they did it, but it's not a friendship-breaking issue. The night wasn't \"ruined\", just marred.\n\n**Champagne Ettiquette** \\- My tongue was a little in my cheek when I came up with the post title. I wasn't trying to say that there's some socially mandated etiquette to serving champagne, just that I thought everyone would understand that it's different to a cheap bottle of Lambrini, and that it would be nice for us all to be there to open it together.\n\n**Why they did it** \\- Clearly from the responses there are two different views - champagne is a social thing that you do together, or it's just a nice/expensive drink, and my friends thought it was the latter. That said, I'm pretty sure they did pop the cork and do a toast from things that they said. They did have other drinks there, but I guess when all you have available is paint stripper vodka and tinned lager, two bottles of chilled Moet in the fridge probably seem quite appealing.", "created_utc": 1684937073, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13qmogh/aita_for_getting_in_a_bad_mood_over_champagne/", "score": 2669, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Everyone\u2019s focusing on the fact that you got pissed, and not on the fact that it was your idea, there was an agreed time and they did the toast early without you for no good reason. Also sounds like they waited for everyone else to get there before they opened it, not like they opened it while they were getting ready because they thought it was no big deal.", "I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with everyone here but i\u2019m going with NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re the one that suggested getting the champagne. You\u2019re the one that made the effort to go out and get it. You made it clear that you would\narrive for 6:30 which was acknowledged by everyone. Yet they contact you ahead of schedule telling you to rush because they can\u2019t stick to the original plan?\n\nI\u2019m going with NTA and you should be upset", ">the point of buying champagne was opening it together and toasting,\n\nExactly. The point was the social aspect of celebrating the end of a collective endeavour. \n\n NTA, you're right to be upset. (It was also your idea and you bought it!)", "NTA. They're not huge assholes either, but they're still the assholes. This is not a hill to die on though and you'd need to determine for yourself if this behavior is a pattern or problematic going forward.\n\nTo all the YTA commenters, IT'S NOT ACTUALLY ABOUT THE CHAMPAGNE!\n\nThe big issue here is that they placed their own impatience over the value of sharing with you. There was a set time and they didn't wait for that time. I'd be annoyed too. And I would be doubly frustrated if I told them it wasn't cool to not wait for me and then they all invalidated my feelings about it. THAT is why you were sour the rest of the night.\n\n  \n\n\nSide story: in HS, my English teacher ordered us a cake to share during lunch time to celebrate finishing our final presentations. There are 2 sections of the class. I'm in study hall when another student in my section says they got a text that the other English section is eating the cake right now because there was a substitute teacher and they convinced them it was okay. So we ask our study hall teacher to go to the English classroom.\n\nWhen we get there, everyone has eaten cake, some took obnoxiously large slices/seconds and there was only a small bit left, enough for us remaining to have a small slice. I, like you, pointed out we were supposed to wait for lunch so everyone could be here. My friends in that section said \"who cares, you got a slice\". And I'm arguing saying \"it's the principle\" and they all just roll their eyes and accuse me of making a big deal out of it because \"I still got cake\".\n\nAnyway, I ended up dropping those friends because I noticed over time a pattern of things like that where I didn't feel personally valued or like we shared the same values.", "NAH- it\u2019s just champagne to them and it was a champagne toast to you to celebrate something I important so I understand you feeling a type of way, but also it\u2019s a small misunderstanding. Let them know you just had a different emotional expectation of the champagne as opposed to it just being champagne to drink. I don\u2019t think your feelings are unreasonable, but just pouting won\u2019t feel any better.", "E S H (edit actually NTA). They should have waited for you, but you're making too much of it. Let it go and communicate clearly next time - your friends don't seem to be able to figure these things out for themselves.", "OP I think you're being real unfair here. I can understand a bit that you might get mad that they didn't wait for you, but to be mad at them all the way through dinner and the rest of the night? You understand you quite literally ruined the evening for your friends because of this.\n\nOP try to see this from the perspective of your friends. They wait for you and pour you a glass. You get upset with them and then you make it quite evident. Now if you were these friends, would you continue inviting this person out for events or would you be cognisant in the future that this person has the capacity to be angry for long periods at a time over little issues.\n\nEdit: YTA btw", "I wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say that you\u2019re TA, but you definitely overreacted. Some things in life just aren\u2019t that serious, and the \u201cproper\u201d way to consume alcohol is one of them.", "NTA\n\nThey could\u2019ve had a glass of ordinary wine while they waited. You arranged it and then missed the toast even though you were on time and they knew you were on the way because they were rude. The only way I can see blame being with you is if you are always late and unreliable and were late again for the drinks.", "What exactly was the issue? You missed the bottle being opened? You had 2 bottles. Were they both gone by the time you arrived?\n\nSince the actual point of champagne is to drink it... it appears you were needlessly upset & may have soured the mood of the evening for everyone. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nWell\u2026 if this is not just the embodiment of 1st world problems. You are upset that you didnt see a cork go pop. You still got to enjoy a little bit of the bubbley and had nice dinner.", "YTA - So you didn't get to see the bottle go \"pop\", why would you let that ruin your evening.  Sounds petty.", "[deleted]", "YTA. What a wild thing to be so upset over. Was it worth ruining the whole evening for everyone? JFC.", "YTA  \n\n\nyou cannot expect people to read your mind if you want them to wait for a reason tell them instead of just expecting someone to just magically know what your intent is", "YTA - I get your point, you wanted to have a celebratory toast, it didnt happen. This wasn\u2019t worth ruining the night over it.", "INFO: did they know you wanted them to wait to open the champagne until you got there?", "Torn between two judgements but I'll go NAH. Seems like more of a miscommunication \u2013 I very much believe that champagne is more about the drinking than the toasting, and you clearly disagree, but it doesn't seem like your friends realised that the toast was the focus in your mind. When I was a student (and even now, 20 years later, tbf) I would have been more concerned that I didn't get my fair share! Hopefully everyone involved can just treat it as water under the bridge?", "YTA. You were the last to arrive. You may have missed the toast, but you got a glass of champagne and then sulked for missing a toast\u2026 which you won\u2019t remember in 10 years.", "YTA i get it you wanted the big toast moment but they clearly didn't *realise* that, its not like they were trying to hide it.

OP is obviously NTA. I can understand the disappointment, when she had clarified that she prefer they wait on her arrival to open the champagne. That said, one can emotionally self regulate and decide wether or not to let the disappointment continue past the moment and get upset the whole evening. It was a decision to let it fester and she ruined the rest of her own night. If that is how one prefers to live life it\u2019s within their rights and they will not be an AH for doing it. It will be a bitter life though.", "> I know nothing about wine and I still know that!\n\nSame here.", "Definitely ungrateful \"friends\" then whom no one should ever bother to plan fun for or do any emotional labor for. They've proven that super clearly here.", "It seems they only had enough champagne for one glass per person, so I imagine that\u2019s why they were both opened. \n\nThe reason I say this is because the friend told OP they saved her glass and everyone paid for their portions so that implies everyone portion was a glass. Which seems weird but I imagine if they didn\u2019t save OP her full portion then that would\u2019ve been complained about too\n\nI\u2019m not justifying their actions so your questions to me are redundant, just saying that her continuing to pout all night was just to cause a scene and have a pity party. Yes, it sucks but either suck it up and enjoy the night or go home to process your feelings", "OP did communicate it. They said to wait for them, and they weren't even late to the appointed time. That's clear communication.", "It was communicated though. She asked them to wait.\n\nThe thing about it, right, is that even *if* they popped the cork, poured 7 glasses, and *then* waited, I don\u2019t think OP would\u2019ve been as upset (not getting into the \u201cit\u2019ll go bad after x amount of time\u201d since they\u2019re all probably ~21 and more than likely don\u2019t know or don\u2019t care). \n\nI don\u2019t necessarily think it was popping and pouring she cared so much about, but rather the fact she was just handed a glass and told to drink. I don\u2019t think you have to be a genius to realize that 21-year olds buying *champagne* to celebrate a huge milestone in their lives = a celebration with a toast. You toast at these kinda things. Honestly, I can count on one hand how many 21 year olds I know even like champagne, and even less that would actually purchase it unless it\u2019s specifically for a celebration like this. You don\u2019t bring champagne to a birthday party, Yknow? So, clearly, it\u2019s implied that it\u2019s a celebration and, given the milestone, a toast. Poor communication really isn\u2019t the problem here in my opinion, more just dumb/inconsiderate 21 year olds. \n\nDrinking wasn\u2019t really a big deal in my house either. It wasn\u2019t just for special events, but my mom just wasn\u2019t huge on it growing up. Sure, it can be a cultural thing here, but in my mind, this was clearly communicated what she wanted. I don\u2019t think you have to specifically spell out what you want. Plus, she asked them to wait. If it were me asking people to wait, I\u2019d get either a 1) Why?, 2) Okay (then they actually respect that and don\u2019t open the bottles). You don\u2019t say \u201cokay\u201d, open the bottle, pour the bottle, DRINK the bottle, then when your mate arrives say \u201chere\u201d. Like, what did you wait for? Nothing. Exactly. Any of them should\u2019ve said \u201cwait, what did she mean by wait?\u201d Followed by mumbled of \u201cidk\u201d, and a \u201cidk, let\u2019s just pour it and wait? I guess?\u201d Or a \u201clet\u2019s wait to open the bottle I guess?\u201d. There were SEVEN of them, and all 7 were apparently sharing the same half brain cell. I feel like at *least* one of them should\u2019ve questioned it.\n\nWould I have been in a sour mood? Honestly, no. Not me personally. I might\u2019ve been a bit irked and that was it. Would I have left? Also, no. I\u2019d consider myself a relatively sensitive person but also a \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck\u201d person rolled into one. I don\u2019t blame Op for being upset. She communicated what she wanted and they just kinda stepped on that. Blowing up the friendship over that is meh, but also, we don\u2019t know her emotional headspace. Sensitivity to you and me may be different, and depending on the days, the same exact event would affect me dramatically differently. Maybe she was just having a really bad day and was more upset than normal? Who really knows.", "I don't think it is, I think enough people felt apologetic to where they understood that it wasn't the nicest thing to do. Even if a few didn't feel it mattered at all.\n\nBased on the reaction of her friends, I'd say that at least within that social group that preference doesn't need to be communicated. Some friends felt bad and they understand that what they did wasn't nice.\n\nEdit: what I mean to say is, even if OP had said \"I want to be there when the bottles pop\", they still might have gone ahead without her. Her friends understood that she would want to be there, and they went ahead anyway, and that's why they feel bad.", "I would also be surprised if this was actually champagne and not prosecco.

They probably didn't think it mattered. But now they know it upsets you, next time they'll probably wait. But it is bratty to sulk over something so small for so long.

You don't get champagne just to have alcohol. Champagne is a celebratory drink. Popping it open is half the fun. It's not even like OP was late. OP was early and they still couldn't wait.", "No, because that one person is the one who organized the chamagne and meet-up time in the first place. We\u2019d say Y T A because why didn\u2019t you guys just wait until 6:30 like you all had agreed?", "No one had to wait because the agreed time was 6:30 and OP was a little bit early.", "Then why would you buy champagne expensive enough that the cost had to be split 6 ways?", "I get it, too.  I\u2019ve had to work on it, and to understand that I\u2019m not letting people in the wrong off the hook, I\u2019m granting myself the pleasures I want.  That celebration is likely to be overshadowed in her memory by her bad mood during it, and the only one that costs is her.\n\nThere is plenty of time after to let these friends know that she was angry and hurt, and to decide which friendships she wants to carry on and whether it\u2019s time to let any of them drift away.", "Are you ok? You responded to another comment of mine completely fabricating my post history. That doesn\u2019t seem like something a mentally stable person would do. I genuinely hope you get help man", "Idk. Being treated like an afterthought by your own friends seems like a pretty hurtful issue that isn't something I could process in like 10min and be fine. It's a minor action sure, but it's implications are fairly substantial.", "I'm sorry but how is it entitled? She paid for champagne she only got one glass of, missed an important social moment she planned, and got her feelings dismissed when she brought them up in the moment. She didn't throw a tantrum or scream herself hoarse or expect to be  given something she didn't pay for. She was just more reserved during dinner and her friends could tell her feelings were hurt cuz they know her as a person. \n\nExpecting someone to pretend nothing happen or stuff their feelings down cuz their friends might realize they have feelings is not healthy, but also not realistic. You can't prevent feelings and it sounds like OP tried to still be polite, but no one can 100% just bounce back instantly from being hurt", "Bruh. I didn\u2019t even know r/lonely is a thing. Why did you just make this up? Lol? I do play some classic WoW occasionally though, no doubt about that. \n\nImagine being so unhinged that you make things up about another person on Reddit lol straight up goofy behavior\n\nEdit: looks like you made your account a couple hours ago.  Were you the person that got banned for wishing death on people the other day? I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re mad that I reported you lol", "How man time does OP have to get over it before it's too much?", ":doubt:", "And yet, people obviously got there well before the agreed on time. Should they just have sat quietly until the last person arrived? It seems to me that starting to celebrate a major accomplishment as soon as people are there is normal.", "Should the friends have sat around and not done anything until OP got there?\n\nSeems like either there are no assholes here, or everyone sucks. The friends for starting without OP, but the OP for wanting the friends to just sit quietly until she showed up.", "How did she deprive herself of a fun evening when she was clearly upset. Faking being happy won't make the evening fun for her. It makes it fun for everybody who already was an asshole towards her.", "If they were sorry they should apologise honestly. Maybe that would help. They were not sorry. They did not see what was wrong. And sometimes it hard to be genuinely happy and enjoy the event after initial disappointment. It\u2019s easy to say \u201cdon\u2019t let it spoil your mood\u201d when the person wants to cry because they were hurt. I think it\u2019s exactly contrary, unless they genuinely feel guilty and apologise honestly I\u2019m quite happy op ruined their mood. And for people saying it was minor. It wasn\u2019t! It\u2019s disrespecting op and showing her the experience with her is less important then drinking alcohol right now. Was the 10 minutes that long that couldn\u2019t wait? \nIt\u2019s called alcoholism if you can\u2019t stop yourself. Op is better alone then with friends like this, treating her as \u201cless important\u201d", "You're right. Maturity is after the party letting your friends know your feelings on the situation and to please wait for her in the future.", "Last person to arrive is always late.", "I think you confuse prosecco with champagne. Champagne is the really expensive stuff you don't mix while prosecco is the cheap stuff. It's like you are buying 30 year old scotch to mix it with Coke.", "I overlooked the age. Maybe my critique was a bit harsh in retrospect. I grew up in restaurants and would have understood this etiquette at age 16. Anyway, I still understand OPs frustration, but maybe calling her friends \"trashy\" was a bit much.\n\nEdit: reading the other comments. 21 or not. Toast or not. Opening and drinking without everyone present is lame. It's like starting dinner without her on a special occasion.", "She even texted them and asked them to wait, and they decided to disregard that and proceed anyway.", "Yes, they should have waited.", "I misread. Regardless, I still don\u2019t think they\u2019re assholes. Four housemates are getting ready for a celebration dinner, maybe one of them opened it before seeing the messages. I still think it holds they had different expectations of the meaning of the champagne and no one is an asshole for it", "They could have let her know they wanted to get together sooner, they could talk, listen to music, have a drink. Just save the champagne OP bought until everybody was there. They never waited on New Years Eve?", "I guess over the years I\u2019ve largely learned to make that space somehow and for enough time to let the big emotions go.  The bigger the slight, the bigger the challenge.  And notice it wasn\u2019t really a criticism of OP, it was a wish for her.  The way I look at it is negative emotions toward a person gives them power over my well being, especially when there is nothing they can do to make it right.  Should they all have apologized?  Yes - but if OP conditions her enjoyment of the evening in that, she\u2019s letting others control the outcome.\n\nSometimes 5 minutes of meditation in the restroom and a quick mental \u201cscrew them\u201d can do wonders for your mood!", "Again, I\u2019m not suggesting she fake.  I\u2019m suggesting she learns to not stew in her own anger for her own sake, not for anyone else\u2019s.  It\u2019s about learning to let the upset go in the moment and address it as needed later.", "Thanks for writing this. I have rejection sensitivity as well, courtesy of my ADHD, and my control over this kind of thing is spotty at best. I better get practicing I guess.", "How do you figure? Are you saying OP is just lying about what time she arrived, or are you saying that no matter how early everyone is, you consider the last person to arrive at a rendezvous to be \"late\"?", "Also prosecco is cheap. You would never mix an expensive bottle of alcohol with a soft drink. Imagine spending hundreds of dollars on whiskey that aged for decades and then mix it with Coke. Some ppl get a hissy fit if you put ice cubes into it.", "I mean Prosecco is colloquially referred to as champagne. There is nothing suggesting this wasn\u2019t Prosecco. I agree that it would be different if the champagne was very expensive. Considering they bought 2 bottles and no other alcohol from the facts provided, it seems as though it was meant as the pregame alcohol. That implies to me it was more similar to Prosecco. Could be wrong though.", "Oh yeah, I\u2019m not challenging the idea that it\u2019s rude: It is. But it\u2019s also the type of error that\u2019s really common at my age \ud83d\ude05", "And, again, if we were getting the other side of this and someone was asking if their friend who was telling everyone not to start celebrating until they showed? We'd all be saying that friends was the asshole.", "Oh lord, you are a bit much. Well adjusted people know how to not sweat the small stuff. The end.", "You\u2019re welcome, honestly I\u2019m ridiculously happy and feel so validated by your response. It really does take practice, but eventually it becomes more and more natural to step back for a moment and work through hard things when they are happening. There are still people and situations where it\u2019s harder, like with family or in situations that trigger trauma responses, but even with those harder moments it has become easier to work through them afterwards and stop myself from feeding into arguments or speak before I\u2019ve had time to think/process. Not gonna lie though, it takes time. I\u2019ve sat through the internal monologue of trying to tell myself to think it through, try to see from their perspective, what reasons other than complete rejection of me would someone have that caused what they said or did, is what I\u2019m feeling an accurate reflection of the situation, blah blah blah\u2026 sometimes I feel like I\u2019m just fighting with myself. That part eventually gets easier, I just also have to remind myself that I\u2019m not trying to invalidate how I\u2019m feeling, just question if my feelings are an accurate reflection the other person\u2019s reality as well. Big feelings are valid, but questioning them helps me with realizing my perception of reality isn\u2019t going to be the same as someone else\u2019s, I won\u2019t know unless I take time to talk with them and figure it out\n\nControl issues is another big issue for me, working on reframing and really thinking things through was hard and the control issues played a big part in that. It\u2019s hard to just sit back and let things play out while I think about it, but over time it has definitely helped me become more able to stand that I can\u2019t control a situation. I don\u2019t have to be okay with how it plays out, but I don\u2019t feel that overwhelming anxiety as much anymore and it is a nice bit of relief.", "I'm saying that I don't expect everyone to have waited for me to get there when I'm the last person to show up, even if I'm also early. Nor do any of the people I know expect it either.\n\nThings start when people arrive.", "I think i might have also.", "Gen Z'ers insisting they/them or random pronouns should be used at every turn even when the gender (he/she) is known.

Nothing is wrong with champagne as a pregame, though it\u2019s kinda odd to assume it\u2019s *just* a pregame given the other context (as was the suggestion of the commenter above).", "If it was just prosecco you don't need to divide the cost of two bottles by 8 ppl. In Germany a 0.75 litre bottle of prosecco from a \"quality\" brand costs 4\u20ac. That's 8\u20ac for two bottles. Nobody would split that to get 1\u20ac from every person involved.", "Understood, bro:)\n\nEdit: sister/human (don't know..)", ">And, again, if we were getting the other side of this and someone was asking if their friend who was telling everyone not to start celebrating until they showed?

I just looked it up and at the wine/spirits store near me you can get Prosecco/champagne at virtually any price from $15-$100 and above that.  Was it a $20 bottle? $30? $40? What price/brand is acceptable for you? I have seen mimosas made from the cheapest Prosecco bottle available and from a $40 bottle.\n\nEven so, two $20 bottles with each person throwing in $5\u2026 sounds like exactly what I remember from splitting alcohol in college lol \n\nThe fact is, we have no idea how expensive the champagne was. I\u2019m judging it by how everyone treated it because I have no other information. Everyone else involved seemed to treat it like a Prosecco bottle for drinking at a pregame.

It's incredibly clear what was meant.", "lol \ud83d\ude02 at the hilarious obtuseness of everyone defending OP", "Bad example, because I'd mostly be in awe that people started a movie without an hour of chatting and drinking beforehand.\n\nLets go with what OP had: a celebration. No, I would not be surprised that people started celebrating before I arrived if a critical mass was already there. \n\nWould I be sad? Sure; sucks a lot when things start without you. Would I think they're all assholes and stew about how they should have waited for me? No.", "Yeah. Idk what it says about her friends that starting drinking/celebrating is more important than making sure everyone is there. \n\nAlso, OP said they split the cost of 2 bottles of champagne and the only saved her *one glass* that is no where near a equal share of the champagne they all paid for.", "Its not a riddle, its mixed expectations. Clearly her entire friend group did not see an issue with it, meaning that in their circle the expectation is not \"Everyone must be together before we open this bottle\" it was \"Its here, its cold, we're here, time to drink, make sure OP gets a glass and we'll go to dinner\".   \n\n\nIf you want people to do a specific thing you must tell them that you want that, otherwise you risk your wave of happiness crashing against the rock of reality.

It happens. It\u2019s life.", "> I would not be surprised that people started celebrating before I arrived\n\nBut they didn't just start celebrating.

OP got there before that time and they still had started.\n\nI think the issue is not the champagne but feeling so unimportant in the group that they started early with no consideration to her.
