Regardless, all seven of us are close friends. We all live in the same student-heavy area of our university town, and my house is a five-minute walk from their place.\n\n\r  \nOur final exams ended last week, and my faculty had a big formal event planned on Saturday night (basically a party where you wear formalwear with drinks and live music). We had decided that we would all meet at the house which four of my friends shared, and then get two Ubers to a restaurant near the venue. I suggested that we buy some champagne to drink at my friends\u2019 house before we went to the restaurant, and everyone agreed with the idea. My friend Chloe (one of the four who share the house) and I went to the shop to buy two bottles on Saturday morning, and kept it in their fridge. I paid, and everyone else transferred me their share of the cost. We agreed that we would meet at half past six that evening and get cabs at 7.\n\n\r  \nI was getting ready when I got a message through on our group chat asking when I was coming over. I said half six (it was about quarter past) and one Chloe\u2019s housemates, Dom, messaged that they were going to open the champagne so to get there quickly. I messaged back to wait for me, and they said ok. I quickly finished getting ready and headed to their house. When I got there, they thrust a glass of champagne in my hand and said cheers, and all seemed in good spirits. I was evidently the last person to arrive (was before 6:30) and I immediately clocked that everyone\u2019s glasses were half empty. I asked when they opened it, and they said that they had opened it ten minutes ago, but not to worry as they had saved me a glass. I was pretty upset by this, and kind of snapped back, asking why they couldn\u2019t have just waited.\n\n\r  \nI was pretty upset during dinner, and I think they could tell. Some of them were apologetic, but a couple of them insisted that they didn\u2019t do anything wrong as they had saved me a glass and paid me the money for their share already. I said that the point of buying champagne was opening it together and toasting, not just having the drink itself, and the first bit was what I had missed out on.

Everyone\u2019s focusing on the fact that you got pissed, and not on the fact that it was your idea, there was an agreed time and they did the toast early without you for no good reason. Also sounds like they waited for everyone else to get there before they opened it, not like they opened it while they were getting ready because they thought it was no big deal.", "I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with everyone here but i\u2019m going with NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re the one that suggested getting the champagne. You\u2019re the one that made the effort to go out and get it. You made it clear that you would\narrive for 6:30 which was acknowledged by everyone. Yet they contact you ahead of schedule telling you to rush because they can\u2019t stick to the original plan?\n\nI\u2019m going with NTA and you should be upset", ">the point of buying champagne was opening it together and toasting,\n\nExactly. The point was the social aspect of celebrating the end of a collective endeavour. \n\n NTA, you're right to be upset. (It was also your idea and you bought it!)", "NTA. They're not huge assholes either, but they're still the assholes. This is not a hill to die on though and you'd need to determine for yourself if this behavior is a pattern or problematic going forward.\n\nTo all the YTA commenters, IT'S NOT ACTUALLY ABOUT THE CHAMPAGNE!\n\nThe big issue here is that they placed their own impatience over the value of sharing with you. There was a set time and they didn't wait for that time. I'd be annoyed too. And I would be doubly frustrated if I told them it wasn't cool to not wait for me and then they all invalidated my feelings about it. THAT is why you were sour the rest of the night.\n\n  \n\n\nSide story: in HS, my English teacher ordered us a cake to share during lunch time to celebrate finishing our final presentations. There are 2 sections of the class. I'm in study hall when another student in my section says they got a text that the other English section is eating the cake right now because there was a substitute teacher and they convinced them it was okay. So we ask our study hall teacher to go to the English classroom.\n\nWhen we get there, everyone has eaten cake, some took obnoxiously large slices/seconds and there was only a small bit left, enough for us remaining to have a small slice. I, like you, pointed out we were supposed to wait for lunch so everyone could be here. My friends in that section said \"who cares, you got a slice\". And I'm arguing saying \"it's the principle\" and they all just roll their eyes and accuse me of making a big deal out of it because \"I still got cake\".\n\nAnyway, I ended up dropping those friends because I noticed over time a pattern of things like that where I didn't feel personally valued or like we shared the same values.", "NAH- it\u2019s just champagne to them and it was a champagne toast to you to celebrate something I important so I understand you feeling a type of way, but also it\u2019s a small misunderstanding. Let them know you just had a different emotional expectation of the champagne as opposed to it just being champagne to drink. I don\u2019t think your feelings are unreasonable, but just pouting won\u2019t feel any better.", "E S H (edit actually NTA). They should have waited for you, but you're making too much of it. Let it go and communicate clearly next time - your friends don't seem to be able to figure these things out for themselves.", "OP I think you're being real unfair here. I can understand a bit that you might get mad that they didn't wait for you, but to be mad at them all the way through dinner and the rest of the night? You understand you quite literally ruined the evening for your friends because of this.\n\nOP try to see this from the perspective of your friends. They wait for you and pour you a glass. You get upset with them and then you make it quite evident. Now if you were these friends, would you continue inviting this person out for events or would you be cognisant in the future that this person has the capacity to be angry for long periods at a time over little issues.\n\nEdit: YTA btw", "I wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say that you\u2019re TA, but you definitely overreacted. Some things in life just aren\u2019t that serious, and the \u201cproper\u201d way to consume alcohol is one of them.", "NTA\n\nThey could\u2019ve had a glass of ordinary wine while they waited. You arranged it and then missed the toast even though you were on time and they knew you were on the way because they were rude. The only way I can see blame being with you is if you are always late and unreliable and were late again for the drinks.", "What exactly was the issue? You missed the bottle being opened? You had 2 bottles. Were they both gone by the time you arrived?\n\nSince the actual point of champagne is to drink it... it appears you were needlessly upset & may have soured the mood of the evening for everyone. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nWell\u2026 if this is not just the embodiment of 1st world problems. You are upset that you didnt see a cork go pop. You still got to enjoy a little bit of the bubbley and had nice dinner.", "YTA - So you didn't get to see the bottle go \"pop\", why would you let that ruin your evening.  Sounds petty.", "[deleted]", "YTA. What a wild thing to be so upset over. Was it worth ruining the whole evening for everyone?

This wasn\u2019t worth ruining the night over it.", "INFO: did they know you wanted them to wait to open the champagne until you got there?", "Torn between two judgements but I'll go NAH. Seems like more of a miscommunication \u2013 I very much believe that champagne is more about the drinking than the toasting, and you clearly disagree, but it doesn't seem like your friends realised that the toast was the focus in your mind. When I was a student (and even now, 20 years later, tbf) I would have been more concerned that I didn't get my fair share! Hopefully everyone involved can just treat it as water under the bridge?", "YTA. You were the last to arrive. You may have missed the toast, but you got a glass of champagne and then sulked for missing a toast\u2026 which you won\u2019t remember in 10 years.", "YTA i get it you wanted the big toast moment but they clearly didn't *realise* that, its not like they were trying to hide it. They obviously thought you meant to save you a glass. Its a miscommunication no need to be so angry.", "YTA you created a problem out of nothing", "YTA you didn't get to pop the bottle so you pouted like a spoiled brat at dinner souring the night.

I'd try to get over it, but sometimes it's hard in the moment.", "Thanks for the recommendation!", "If you wanna start pregaming that\u2019s fine just use literally anything other than the champagne your friend who hasn\u2019t arrived yet bought.", "A bit hyperbolic sure, but I think it makes the point well. Both a birthday cake and champagne for a celebratory toast have certain social mores attached to them, and in the same way you wouldn't blow out candles on a cake that isn't yours, you wouldn't open champagne for a toast until all are there.", "and while you replied they probably were already opening it, not realizing that you were going to be upset. They obviously just saw it as a celebratory drink, not a ceremony. They probably feel bad and I understand why you're upset, but it's over and done and I really don't think it was meant as a slight at all.", "I can see your point. But they didn't. You probably should have said, \"Please wait for me to arrive in 10 minutes because I want to toast together.\" They're clearly a bit thick and need this explaining. Had they still opened it then I think my feelings would have been very hurt.", "It was for the \"friends\". They chose alcohol first above the company of OP. Like going out to diner, everybody eats earlier than planned, but h\u00e9 we saved you a plate. OP deserves better friends.", "I mean yeah, but I\u2019ve also seen and been at weddings where the champagne is already open and poured when you get it.", "They all agreed to meet at a specific time, she even said she was running late. Everyone else got there on time, she lives five mins away and couldn't manage to get there on the agreed upon time? That is just as rude as not waiting", "Early! Got there before 6:30, which was the agreed upon time. NTA they were being inconsiderate for not waiting the 10 minutes. Champagne gets flat too.", "Nta but is it worth being a hill to die on? Seems to me as thoughtless but not necessarily malicious.", "NTA", "Yes! Some wines improve when they're allowed to breathe. Champagne is not one of them. I know nothing about wine and I still know that!", "it was 10 minutes mate", "Probably needed a minute alone before OP showed up, she seems like a major bummer lol", "Yeah, same.", "Yeah, but some people are more sensitive than others, and some can't control what bothers them or doesn't. It definitely wasn't the champagne, but what it represented. I wouldn't have let it ruin my night, but I probably would have got my own bottle, gone home and celebrated my own way", "\"We're going to open it.\"\n\n\"Wait for me.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nGeez, how could they have possibly known what the expected action was here?", "It\u2019s not the etiquette. It\u2019s the lack of respect and the lack of caring, the demonstration that they didn\u2019t care enough to wait. That\u2019s why OP is upset and that\u2019s perfectly valid.", "It's not even champagne etiquette, it's basic \"not raised in a barn\" politeness. If you're invited to dinner and the host tells you dinner will be served at 6pm, you arrive before 6, and everyone's halfway done eating, that's fucking rude. If OP was late, that would be different, but they were on time!", "The etiquette wasn\u2019t the problem (post\u2019s title is misleading).  Bad etiquette would have been for example not uncorking the bottle then right way or not serving the champagne in the right glass.\n\nThis is about agreeing to meet at a certain time and not waiting for someone who even arrives early.  It\u2019s not champagne etiquette, it\u2019s friendship etiquette", "No. OP contributed to the purchase of this stuff. There isn\u2019t some secret double-handshake code needed to know that it\u2019s hugely inconsiderate to open their bottles of champagne without them.", "You have A single toast WITH THE ENTIRE GROUP, especially the one who set it up!\n\nThey proved getting drunk was more important than the OP", "Okay but by age 21 they should know the etiquette of *waiting for someone* after they agreed to wait for that person, right?", "I have to go with what the OP has written.  She didn't say or imply that anyone was ever on her side at any point in this.  \n\nShe says some were \"apologetic\" afterwards, likely because OP was visibly upset.", "yeah, the best skill I\u2019ve learned in recent years is being able to catch myself feeling strong emotions, take a few deep breaths and go \u201chow am I feeling right now? why am I feeling that?\u201d then choosing to frame things differently.\n\nsometimes bad stuff happens to you, but you have control over how you respond to it", " Like going out to diner, everybody eats earlier than planned, but h\u00e9 we saved you a plate.", "For sure!\n\nThe chimps are all named and their behavior is described pretty narratively. So it isnt just a dry academic article on chimp behavior in captivity. \n\nIts based on studies on chimp behavior in the 70s so one must read it with that in mind. Our understanding of primate intelligence has certainly evolved quite a bit in the past 50 years and some biologists were wilin back then. But as a pop sci book it is very entertaining and approachable for a layperson.  \n\n(Side note since remembering this reminded me that meerkat manor exists. I will be watching some reruns of that tonight.)", "but all they had was champagne, that\u2019s what was bought for pregaming", "Except OP did say to wait for her...", "She says they all agreed to meet at half six. Everyone else got there early.", "She was on time, everyone else was early. They agreed to meet at half past and she got there before half past.", "Literally none of that is true apart from the fact that she lives 5 mins away. Where did you read any of that?", "for me the clear communication gap is that OP never mentioned a champagne toast and just assumed saying \u201clet\u2019s get champagne\u201d would be understood to mean a toast, and her friends just saw it as another bottle to pregame with.\n\nanother POV could be:\n\nMy friends and I decided to get together to have pre drinks and go to a restaurant to celebrate. One of my friends wanted a certain type of alcohol, she bought it and we paid her back for our share. Most of us were there so we opened it and started drinking, then she came and threw a fit because we started drinking without her. AITA for not waiting until everyone arrived to start pregaming?", "Next time, keep things at your house and bring them with you.", "Interesting. You really would have gone home after that ? I would have personally brushed it up , downed my champagne and partied", "I do the same thing. I\u2019m autistic and have adhd, so emotional dysregulation/big emotions are a massive struggle for me. Trying to take a moment to breathe and really look into how I\u2019m feeling and how I can reframe it to help myself calm has personally been so helpful. I try to remind myself that it\u2019s okay to feel how I do and it\u2019s okay that I\u2019m having a big feeling, cause it is okay, I can\u2019t control how I feel. I can control how I react to my feelings though, even though sometimes it really feels like my chest is going to explode and overwhelming af. \n\nI can imagine how I could potentially spiral emotionally in OP\u2019s situation, how hard the rejection sensitivity dysphoria could kick in, but reframing can help me self soothe. It can be the difference between feeling like all my friends hate me and feeling like they didn\u2019t realize how important something was to me. It could be the difference between isolating myself out of fear of rejection and having a conversation where I ask them to be more considerate and try to find a better way to communicate when each of us wants to stress how important something is to each other.\n\nReframing things is really helpful. Thank you for bringing it up, hopefully others who struggle will read your response and try it out. It definitely takes practice, it can feel so unnatural, but eventually it gets easier. It\u2019s also an amazing tool for promoting empathy, which I absolutely love.", "That\u2019s different.", "You're not", "You are correct, I will edit my vote.", "Sorry but that\u2019s BS\u2026 champagne isn\u2019t the sort of thing you buy as celebratory without one of the group. The only thing I can guess is that the others were already tipsy/drunk and didn\u2019t think clearly, but OP is definitely NTA.", "And they'd *still* be TA in that scenario. You don't open somebody else's bottle before they get there, even if you paid them back for it.", "Yeah. They showed total lack of consideration for their friend in this situation. She made the plan, set a time, and they started early without letting her know. (Edit: they let her know, but not with enough time to do anything about it) Popping the bottle and toasting was like the entire point of her getting the champagne. It was meant to be a moment of comradery, getting left out of something like that really sucks. And champagne gets weird the longer it sits. They should have waited until everyone involved was there, but they didn't. The only way my night would be ruined is if I hung around the people who had just done something so thoughtless. I would need my space from them at that point. Nothing makes me more upset than pretending to be happy", "I would have gone home too. At the very *beginning* of the night my group of friends decided I wasn\u2019t worth waiting for(barely waiting bc she showed up earlier than the planned time!)? I would feel like the whole time they didn\u2019t actually want me there. I go where I\u2019m celebrated, not tolerated.", "It's really not", "well that\u2019s my whole point is that \u201cbuying as celebratory\u201d was never really communicated. For a lot of people it is implied by the simple fact that you\u2019re getting champagne, but it feels unfair to presume that every uni student sees it as more than \u201cthe type of alcohol we bought for pre drinks tonight\u201d", "Same. I would be very upset and think they don\u2019t care for me if everyone was already there well before the agreed upon time.", "I don't think you're the AH. But I'm curious if you think they opened it out of ignorance or malice?", "This was never really about the champagne. It\u2019s about OP believing her friends intended to hurt her feelings by not waiting for her. They certainly may not be great friends & had some intentions but imo it appears it was just bad timing & the excitement of the occasion. Definitely do not believe ruining her own night was a good solution to the problem.\n\nEnjoy the feeling accomplishment, some champagne & then move on to big & better things!"]}
