{"id": 18070, "submission_id": "13qmogh", "title": "AITA for getting in a bad mood over champagne etiquette?", "selftext": "Background: I (21F) am in my final year of university (in the UK). I have a group of seven close friends who do my course. Four people from this group share a house, while me and our other friends live separately, each with our own housemates. Regardless, all seven of us are close friends. We all live in the same student-heavy area of our university town, and my house is a five-minute walk from their place.\n\n\r  \nOur final exams ended last week, and my faculty had a big formal event planned on Saturday night (basically a party where you wear formalwear with drinks and live music). We had decided that we would all meet at the house which four of my friends shared, and then get two Ubers to a restaurant near the venue. I suggested that we buy some champagne to drink at my friends\u2019 house before we went to the restaurant, and everyone agreed with the idea. My friend Chloe (one of the four who share the house) and I went to the shop to buy two bottles on Saturday morning, and kept it in their fridge. I paid, and everyone else transferred me their share of the cost. We agreed that we would meet at half past six that evening and get cabs at 7.\n\n\r  \nI was getting ready when I got a message through on our group chat asking when I was coming over. I said half six (it was about quarter past) and one Chloe\u2019s housemates, Dom, messaged that they were going to open the champagne so to get there quickly. I messaged back to wait for me, and they said ok. I quickly finished getting ready and headed to their house. When I got there, they thrust a glass of champagne in my hand and said cheers, and all seemed in good spirits. I was evidently the last person to arrive (was before 6:30) and I immediately clocked that everyone\u2019s glasses were half empty. I asked when they opened it, and they said that they had opened it ten minutes ago, but not to worry as they had saved me a glass. I was pretty upset by this, and kind of snapped back, asking why they couldn\u2019t have just waited.\n\n\r  \nI was pretty upset during dinner, and I think they could tell. Some of them were apologetic, but a couple of them insisted that they didn\u2019t do anything wrong as they had saved me a glass and paid me the money for their share already. I said that the point of buying champagne was opening it together and toasting, not just having the drink itself, and the first bit was what I had missed out on. It put me in a bad mood for the rest of the night, and probably soured the evening a little for everyone. AITA for getting in a bad mood over this, or was it justified?", "created_utc": 1684937073, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13qmogh/aita_for_getting_in_a_bad_mood_over_champagne/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Everyone\u2019s focusing on the fact that you got pissed, and not on the fact that it was your idea, there was an agreed time and they did the toast early without you for no good reason. Also sounds like they waited for everyone else to get there before they opened it, not like they opened it while they were getting ready because they thought it was no big deal.", "I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with everyone here but i\u2019m going with NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re the one that suggested getting the champagne. You\u2019re the one that made the effort to go out and get it. You made it clear that you would\narrive for 6:30 which was acknowledged by everyone. Yet they contact you ahead of schedule telling you to rush because they can\u2019t stick to the original plan?\n\nI\u2019m going with NTA and you should be upset", ">the point of buying champagne was opening it together and toasting,\n\nExactly. The point was the social aspect of celebrating the end of a collective endeavour. \n\n NTA, you're right to be upset. (It was also your idea and you bought it!)", "NTA. They're not huge assholes either, but they're still the assholes. This is not a hill to die on though and you'd need to determine for yourself if this behavior is a pattern or problematic going forward.\n\nTo all the YTA commenters, IT'S NOT ACTUALLY ABOUT THE CHAMPAGNE!\n\nThe big issue here is that they placed their own impatience over the value of sharing with you. There was a set time and they didn't wait for that time. I'd be annoyed too. And I would be doubly frustrated if I told them it wasn't cool to not wait for me and then they all invalidated my feelings about it. THAT is why you were sour the rest of the night.\n\n  \n\n\nSide story: in HS, my English teacher ordered us a cake to share during lunch time to celebrate finishing our final presentations. There are 2 sections of the class. I'm in study hall when another student in my section says they got a text that the other English section is eating the cake right now because there was a substitute teacher and they convinced them it was okay. So we ask our study hall teacher to go to the English classroom.\n\nWhen we get there, everyone has eaten cake, some took obnoxiously large slices/seconds and there was only a small bit left, enough for us remaining to have a small slice. I, like you, pointed out we were supposed to wait for lunch so everyone could be here. My friends in that section said \"who cares, you got a slice\". And I'm arguing saying \"it's the principle\" and they all just roll their eyes and accuse me of making a big deal out of it because \"I still got cake\".\n\nAnyway, I ended up dropping those friends because I noticed over time a pattern of things like that where I didn't feel personally valued or like we shared the same values.", "NAH- it\u2019s just champagne to them and it was a champagne toast to you to celebrate something I important so I understand you feeling a type of way, but also it\u2019s a small misunderstanding. Let them know you just had a different emotional expectation of the champagne as opposed to it just being champagne to drink. I don\u2019t think your feelings are unreasonable, but just pouting won\u2019t feel any better.", "ESH. They should have waited for you, but you're making too much of it. Let it go and communicate clearly next time - your friends don't seem to be able to figure these things out for themselves.", "OP I think you're being real unfair here. I can understand a bit that you might get mad that they didn't wait for you, but to be mad at them all the way through dinner and the rest of the night? You understand you quite literally ruined the evening for your friends because of this.\n\nOP try to see this from the perspective of your friends. They wait for you and pour you a glass. You get upset with them and then you make it quite evident. Now if you were these friends, would you continue inviting this person out for events or would you be cognisant in the future that this person has the capacity to be angry for long periods at a time over little issues.\n\nEdit: YTA btw", "I wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say that you\u2019re TA, but you definitely overreacted. Some things in life just aren\u2019t that serious, and the \u201cproper\u201d way to consume alcohol is one of them.", "NTA\n\nThey could\u2019ve had a glass of ordinary wine while they waited. You arranged it and then missed the toast even though you were on time and they knew you were on the way because they were rude. The only way I can see blame being with you is if you are always late and unreliable and were late again for the drinks.", "What exactly was the issue? You missed the bottle being opened? You had 2 bottles. Were they both gone by the time you arrived?\n\nSince the actual point of champagne is to drink it... it appears you were needlessly upset & may have soured the mood of the evening for everyone. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nWell\u2026 if this is not just the embodiment of 1st world problems. You are upset that you didnt see a cork go pop. You still got to enjoy a little bit of the bubbley and had nice dinner.", "YTA - So you didn't get to see the bottle go \"pop\", why would you let that ruin your evening.  Sounds petty.", "Yta, they opened a bottle minutes before you got there, saved your share, and all paid their part. There is literally nothing to be upset about.  If not being there when the bottle is opened upsets you that much it put a damper on the night, you may need to reevaluate your relationship with alcohol", "YTA. What a wild thing to be so upset over. Was it worth ruining the whole evening for everyone? JFC.", "YTA  \n\n\nyou cannot expect people to read your mind if you want them to wait for a reason tell them instead of just expecting someone to just magically know what your intent is", "YTA - I get your point, you wanted to have a celebratory toast, it didnt happen. This wasn\u2019t worth ruining the night over it.", "INFO: did they know you wanted them to wait to open the champagne until you got there?", "Torn between two judgements but I'll go NAH. Seems like more of a miscommunication \u2013 I very much believe that champagne is more about the drinking than the toasting, and you clearly disagree, but it doesn't seem like your friends realised that the toast was the focus in your mind. When I was a student (and even now, 20 years later, tbf) I would have been more concerned that I didn't get my fair share! Hopefully everyone involved can just treat it as water under the bridge?", "YTA. You were the last to arrive. You may have missed the toast, but you got a glass of champagne and then sulked for missing a toast\u2026 which you won\u2019t remember in 10 years.", "YTA i get it you wanted the big toast moment but they clearly didn't *realise* that, its not like they were trying to hide it. They obviously thought you meant to save you a glass. Its a miscommunication no need to be so angry.", "YTA you created a problem out of nothing", "YTA you didn't get to pop the bottle so you pouted like a spoiled brat at dinner souring the night. Jesus, it's not like you lost money missing the stupid pop.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I understand the disappointment of not being there when they opened it, but it's really not that big of a deal. I would understand if they had drank it all, without saving you a glass, but they did.

Otherwise, you're acting like an exhausting child. Get over yourself and apologize to the entire group. You can ask for a redo, but then you need to cover the costs entirely since this was all you and your head.
