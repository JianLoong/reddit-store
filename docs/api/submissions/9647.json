We both work full-time jobs and have three kids, ages 3, 6 and 7.\n\nI used to work from home with flexible hours but I've been offered a promotion which requires me to go to work in person. The pay increase is really significant so my wife and I agreed I should take the promotion and hire a part-time nanny for our kids.\n\nI got in touch with a nanny agency and they matched us to someone who lives local. They only told us her first name which was a really common name anyway, but for the sake of story telling we'll say her name's Sarah.\n\nI spoke to Sarah on the phone and she seemed really nice. We arranged a day for her to come over and meet my wife and the kids and for us to show her around the house.\n\nWhen the day came around and we met her, it turned out that my wife already knew Sarah. It was really awkward. I wasn't sure how they knew each other until afterwards.\n\nMy wife told me that back when she was in high school, her boyfriend at the time cheated on her with Sarah who was in her class.\n\nShe wasn't enthusiastic about it but my wife didn't seem to have a problem with Sarah being our nanny at first. Our kids love her, she has lots of experience and she's available when we need her.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks with pretty much no issues, my two oldest kids come to me and say that they don't want Sarah to come back. I ask them why and they said she's \"evil\". I ask why they think she's evil and our 6 year old starts crying and says that Sarah is mean and wants to hurt mommy.\n\nI talked to my wife in private and at first she said she had no idea what the kids were talking about and that it must be because of something Sarah did. \n\nWhen I pressed it, my wife admitted that she told the kids that Sarah is evil. She said she knows it was a ridiculous plan but she was hoping I'd fire her. My wife asked me to fire the nanny because their history makes her uncomfortable.\n\nI asked why it wasn't an issue before. My wife said she just needed to think about it and she's decided Sarah has to go.\n\nI told my wife that we can find another nanny but until then there's no reason to get rid of Sarah, and that she was out of line for trying to weaponise the kids against her when Sarah is no danger to them.\n\nMy wife disagreed and said that we need to just fire Sarah ASAP and hire a temporary babysitter until we can find another nanny. She said that she wasn't weaponising the kids, she was just setting boundaries.\n\nThis turned into a really heated argument and I called my wife insecure and controlling, and told her she needs to go to therapy. My wife said I'm being inconsiderate of her feelings and need to put myself in her shoes.\n\nThis was one of our biggest arguments in a very long time and I just want a neutral opinion on whether I was wrong.", "created_utc": 1676063647, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10z39dl/aita_for_arguing_with_my_wife_and_refusing_to/", "score": 2575, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife shouldn\u2019t be talking shit about Sarah to your kids, but you also shouldn\u2019t be insisting that Sarah remain hired. There are *plenty* of other people who I\u2019m sure would be equally as nice and fun as Sarah, with the added bonus that this one won\u2019t have painful beef with your wife.", "ESH.\n\n  \nYour wife got cheated on by her ex with the woman who is in your lives and in your kids lives. The sensible thing to do would've been say right away, \"Okay, we'll find someone else.\"  \nYou are being inconsiderate of her feelings. That makes you an asshole.\n\n  \nYour wife should never have used your kids the way she did - that was beyond the pale. That make her an asshole. \n\n  \nAll in all, it means you all suck.", "ESH\n\nShe went about that in an assbackwards immature way but ultimately she gets a say in who watches the children, she should have just been honest and vetoed Sarah from the start.", "INFO\n\n> they matched us to someone who lives local. \n\nAnd what are your other options? Is it Sarah or nothing? Because if you've got lots of other options ...", "ESH\n\nYou wife isn\u2019t an AH for not wanting Sarah to continue.  However, she is an AH for involving and manipulating the kids. She just should have told you how she felt directly.\n\nBoth you and your wife need to be comfortable with the nanny.  Your wife is not, so the nanny needs to go.", "ESH. Clearly the wife was manipulative, but also Sarah's presence is causing her much distress (and frankly, I do not blame her for feeling that way). Sarah does need to not be your nanny ASAP, and you resisting letting her go is only going to enhance your wife's feelings about her.", "ESH.  She shouldn't have used the children like that.  Ask yourself why she felt the need to though.\n\n>My wife asked me to fire the nanny because their history makes her uncomfortable.\n\nIs plenty of reason to let the nanny go. I wouldn't let someone so negatively connected to my past around my children.\n\nYou didn't listen to her initially when she told you about it and now you accuse her of being insecure? No shit she's insecure, you're keeping someone around her and her children she doesn't like. \n\nYou called her controlling? Wow...if anyone is controlling here, it's you buddy.  Get some therapy yourself.", "YTA: Your wife feels uncomfortable with someone in her home? YOU GET RID OF HER!!!!", "ESH\n\nYour wife was out of line in not communicating directly and using the kids like that. \n\nYou seem to be just dismissing how she's uncomfortable around this person and are imposing your own way. Insecure is maybe fair, but this hiring should be a two person approval and you're being controlling, not her. Telling her to go to therapy for not being cool with someone she knows who hurt her being the nanny, is absurd. \n\nYes, she shouldn't have made up that lie and should have been direct. But right now being direct results in you saying no and dismissing her feelings.", "Wife should have simply never hired sarah. Really weird that she did not simply insist sarah would not work for the 2 off you. Why would firing S be your decision, nvm your desicion alone? that to me points to a bigger problem in the marriage, where their is no equal partnership. I would go in relationship therapy to get to the bottem off that.\n\ni think no judgment can really be given unless we hear from your wife why she felt she could not just fire S because she did not trust her.\n\nthat being said, S should go. Wife hates her , kids know she does, no way that will work. \n\nAlso: why a part-time babysitter when you both work full time? should you not need a full time sitter?", "ESH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour wife DID weaponize the children. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut you should've accepted that Sarah was a bad idea. That this CLEARLY bothers your wife & that you would be best to simply not hire her. I couldn't imagine hiring someone who my partner was cheated on with. You are emotionally inept.", "ESH. Yeah your wife is out of line with this but you NEVER should have brought this woman on to begin with.", "Sad situation for your children. You and your wife are both the AH. \n\nWhy would you want someone in your home caring for your children that has caused your wife so much anguish? Just fire her. \n\nYour wife is the AH for upsetting your children for absolutely no reason, this should\u2019ve been handled btwn the adults. \n\nWould you be okay if the roles were reversed, if a prior gf had cheated on you with a man \u2014 would you want to have that man in your home now caring for your children? I didn\u2019t think so, YTA too.", "I mean i donr know why youd hire someone with history like that with your wife, but yes she did indeed weapinize the kids", "ESH I\u2019ll agree that your wife went overboard and handled this badly. But, you should not have hired her. As soon as you realized they had history you should have just called the agency and asked for a second candidate to interview. This was doomed from the beginning.", "ESH. It would be hard for anyone to allow someone in their lives and alone time with their kids (and, likely, her husband on occasion) with someone who hurt them badly, no matter how long ago the incident was.  You're only making matters worse by adopting a Team Sarah approach.  \n\nThat said, your wife completely botched this.  She shouldn't have agreed to hire Sarah in the first place, she shouldn't have tried to manipulate the situation through the kids.  She's made a mess of the whole thing and should be the one responsible for cleaning it up.", "YTA. \nSorry, my friend this is 26 years of a happy marriage experience talking here. YTA...why are you prioritizing the nanny over your wife? This is bad, as in really bad and if I was your wife I would feel the same as she does. THIS IS VERY SERIOUS...if you keep putting the nanny first it is very, very concerning. This situation for a spouse...this would be the sort of thing where your wife may decide it's her hill to die on. (I would) I would advise you to think about who is more important to appease...the nanny...or your wife, the mother of your children. This is the sort of thing that could REALLY DAMAGE your marriage. Why? Why is it such a big deal to you? It's pretty simple when you think about it. If the situation were reversed, and you no longer had confidence in your Nanny and your wife didn't acknowledge your feelings and didn't back you up...how would the make you feel? Good luck!", "You are wrong. Simple enough? Although, honestly, this is anything but simple. Your wife should have never allowed her to be hired in the first place but is equally wrong for telling the kids that and trying to get you to do her dirty work. So my judgement is ESH. Time to move on. Fire Sarah immediately, and going forward your wife needs to be proactive about her emotions and act like an adult and moving forward you need to have a little more empathy and understanding to how this spiraled. Be more supportive.", "She ABSOLUTELY weaponized the kids. Not cool. NTA.", "ESH. Your wife should have just said she was uncomfortable at the beginning, and not let it get to the point of trash talking the nanny  to your kids. You, shouldn\u2019t keep her on just because it\u2019s easier on you, and probably shouldn\u2019t have hired her in the first place. Such an awkward situation.", "ESH. It was totally ridiculous and disturbing that your wife manipulated your children into doing her dirty work. BUT it is totally reasonable for her to want someone she is comfortable with and trusts in her home alone with her children and you should support that.", "Wow, ESH, big time. Wife used the kids because of something that happened to her around 15-20 years ago, and even though that is ridiculous, so is arguing with her about it instead of just firing sarah and finding another nanny asap as to not cause even more trouble. Just replace the nanny and don't fight with your wife on this. If she's uncomfortable, she's uncomfortable. But I can't believe she thought it was ok to use her kids to try and get the nanny fired instead of communicating with you like an adult.\n\nBoth of you need to reassess how you communicate with one another since clearly you don't do it very well.", "ESH. Your wife has a right to be comfortable with whoever is in her house and watching her kids. For you to just dismiss that is gross. She sucks too bc you're right, she shouldn't have weaponized the kids against her, but you should take how she feels seriously too. Get rid of the nanny. You fighting so hard to keep her is just going to make your wife think her feelings are correct. This person hurt her extremely badly in the past and she's afraid it will happen again. And here you are makig it worse", "ESH. Your wife being uncomfortable with Sarah should've been all the reason you needed to fire her. But your wife weaponizing your children like that is vile.", "NTA and her behavior disturbs me. I can't imagine causing my children to fear their safety or their mothers safety because of my own insecurities from high school. I mean the manipulation and abusive behavior is disturbing. If the truth is not corrected for those kids they could end up believing daddy hired an evil person to get rid of mommy. I think firing because of the wife's behavior and issues could lead to legal ramifications, Slander and wrongful termination.", "ESH and you seriously need to question why your wife doesn\u2019t communicate with you. If she felt safe telling you herself she wouldn\u2019t have to resort to putting your kids in the middle.", "Esh. You need a new babysitter and couples counseling.", "ESH. Both of you need to be 100% comfortable with a person who comes into your house to take care of your kids. Idc if she\u2019s too pretty or too smelly, if your wife can\u2019t handle the idea of her being there then that\u2019s that. However, your wife is messing around with your kids in a way that is completely inapropriate. What message does that send them, that shes basically saying \u201cthis lady is evil incarnate, whelp gotta go to work now bye kids!\u201d It\u2019s such a self-own, teaching her kids that they shouldn\u2019t count on her to protect them from someone that she HERSELF finds abhorrent- they either need to figure shit out for themselves, or go to dad cause mom is all outta fucks.\n\nEasy solution here, agree with your wife that Sarah has to go, but since it\u2019s her problem then she needs to let her go. Be a big girl and own up to it. And then she needs to take more responsibility toward finding a replacement for Sarah- I find it very odd that she\u2019s been so hands off.", "ESH. \n\nWhat your wife did to the kids is unacceptable. But ask yourself, why this woman feels uncomfortable to just ask you to fire the nanny? Why are you ready to disregard her feelings about the situation and die on a very stupid hill? Doesn't the comfort of your children's mother mean nothing to you?", "Can\u2019t you just go along with your wife?  As long as the nanny stays, there will a lot of problems. Is this particular nanny really worth harming or destroying your marriage?", "ESH. \nYou two added a person your wife hates into your home. \n\nYikes", "ESH\n\nYou for not realizing this was a bad idea out of the gate and even asking if it was OK with her.\n\nHer for the stuff with the kids.", "YTA for refusing to fire the nanny asap - sorry Sarah has to go now because she shouldn\u2019t have even been hired - wife should have said no as soon as it was awkward\n\nNTA for being upset/arguing about the weaponizing of the kids - not cool\n\nWife:\nYTA for weaponizing the kids - again not cool, not adult\n\n2 \ud83d\udea9 \n-You said it was awkward right at the first meeting, this tells me she already wasn\u2019t ok with it, so why did she feel a need to try to make it work???  (This alone maybe not a red flag)\n\n-Why did wife weaponize the kids?  Why NOT decide after a week or two to say something?  What she did is extreme and alarming for a situation where her reasoning is pretty understandable and logically sound.  Why did she feel a need to take that route and try to make it happen where YOU decide to fire Sarah?    Then when you find out her reasoning for wanting Sarah to go you refuse so it\u2019s like you\u2019re now punishing her.  The story is outlined to make it look like your wife had a choice in Sarah being there but your actions now indicate the opposite\u2026.\n\nSomething is off in this story and it\u2019s making me anxious", "ESH. You were aware your wife wasn't thrilled about the choice to hire someone she knew with whom she had negative associations, but your wife lost the plot completely. If you want to keep your marriage, you should fire the nanny.", "ESH you should have recognised how uncomfortable this would make your wife and chosen another nanny from the start. \n\nYour wife absolutely weaponised the kids by putting ideas in their heads rather than communicating with you. Worse, she taught her kids not to trust the person who is responsible for their care. \n\nSarah should have removed herself from the situation when she realised who your wife was because it was inappropriate for her to take the job.\n\n>there's no reason to get rid of Sarah\n\nWrong. Going forward, your kids are being looked after by someone they don't trust now, and think is evil. They deserve to have a nanny they can be comfortable with.", "You are totally and undeniably the asshole.  As soon as you learned about how your wife knew Sarah you shouldn't have even considered Sarah to be an option.", "NTA.  She DID weaponize the kids, and it was not the a mature or rational move.  If she wants to fire nanny now, hire someone temporarily while she looks for a replacement, she can do ALL of that.  \n\nAlso, the fact that she did this instead of just talking to you like an adult and partner?  I\u2019d delve into that a lot more.  Not good.", "Esh", "ESH - your wife probably noticed something off about Sarah so wasn\u2019t comfortable with her watching your kids. Thats all the reason she needs to get a different nanny and something you should respect. \n\nYour wife became the AH the second she tried manipulating your kids rather than just talking to you about it.", "ESH  - it may seems silly but she was hurt by this person.  I wouldn't want someone who hurt my like that helping with my children. \n\nShe may have not made a big deal hoping she could move passed it and realized she couldn't.\n\nEdit to add: your wife going through the kids is kind of schmarmy too, but still I would fire her.\n\nChanging the ish to ESH because thats what I meant just had a hard time remembering that was a thing", "ESH\n\nYou should have listened to her valid objections upfront, but that's still no justification for weaponising the kids.", "ESH\n\nSeems like she gave it an honest try, but it ended up being too much. Her going through the kids wasn't cool, AH move there. Given how she admitted everything to you and was ashamed, i feel you should be sympathetic and with her on replacing Sarah ASAP. AH on your part", "ESH- she should have been more honest about her feelings and not shared info with the kids. Separately you knowing that this woman hurt your wife\u2019s trust and you have now put her in charge of caring for the most precious things to her (Ie your kids), you are at minimum dense.\n\nTo be clear this is not a rational situation and while you are expecting your wife to behave differently this is a non-negotiable. While it sucks for Sarah end her assignment because if not this will be another scenario where someone she trusts chooses Sarah over her.", "YTA - You\u2019re really going to make your wife accept a woman that she hates being in her home (typically one\u2019s safe place) around her kids? Way to be a supportive partner. You\u2019re the one who sounds controlling. And if you\u2019re prioritizing a stranger over your wife\u2019s emotional well-being, it sounds like your wife has a reason to be insecure.

Her significant other has cheated, with this specific woman, before.  And now you're arguing with her demanding you keep her on the payroll, and in your close proximity?    \n\n\nYou call your wife insecure, and that seems to be true.  But you're playing into her insecurities.  It's a dumb trope and stereotype, but cheating with the nanny is a public perception.   And this nanny in particular is even worse.  And now you're getting heated defending Sarah to your wife?  You don't get how that appears??  You don't have to be insecure for that to look poorly.  \n\n\nWhat your wife did wasn't great.  But hiring her in the first place was an asshole move.  And now demanding she stick around.  ESH.", "I mean, not great that you hired her in the first place, when you learned about Sarah's history with your wife -- did you think this story would have a happy ending? -- but what your wife did, telling your kids that the nanny is evil, is unhinged. NTA. Probably time to get a new nanny and encourage your wife to speak to someone about this.", "NTA\n\nYour wife has legitimate reasons to not want the nanny there. You gave her an opportunity to voice those at the outset and she did not.\n\nThe manner in which she chose to address this is infantile and harmful to your entire family. She needs to take responsibility for that.\n\nHowever, outright firing the nanny now without a replacement sounds like it would create a hardship for your family and is not reasonable.", "Your wife may be all that but is this the hill you want to die on?\n\nPlus you may be all that what your wife said about you as well.\n\nI wonder if this is how you two deal with disagreements?  Is this an example of a bigger problem on how you two don't respect each other and don't listen?", "Eh. Yeah.... You're both the asshole for different reasons, her moreso though. \n\nYou should put your family first. If she's that uncomfortable, you shouldn't ask her to feel that way about someone in her home and in the care of her kids. As she suggested, I'd say to find a temporary sitter or something until you find someone new\n\nShe's the asshole for manipulating your children, not being up front with you, and not having the balls to fire Sarah herself after talking to you.", "YTA", "NTA your wife is way out of line.  She knew it was stupid to get rid of a good,  qualified, hard to find nanny because of schoolgirl stuff so she weaponized the kids behind your back to get her way underhandedly.  Poor kids.    WOW!", "NTA. If your wife wanted to fire the nanny, she needs to put on her big girl pants and fire the nanny herself. (And I'm surprised your wife doesn't want to fire Sarah. It might be cathartic if she's still holding on to all that anger.) Terrorizing your children into believing the nanny would hurt their mother was all kinds of cruel.", "YTA - at first I thought this was too ancient history to be so conflicted about it; and then I remembered the tired cliche of a husband fucking the nanny - and \\*this\\* nanny has already fucked someone she loved before. If your wife came right out and admitted this was probably now an intrusive worry of hers, you would have likely had the EXACT same reaction \"insecure and controlling, you need therapy\" because you'd prefer the convenience of having a nanny over her feelings. And you might as well put yourself on a waitlist again because no way are those kids going to go back to having a warm relationship with Sarah now that it's all done.", "YTA. \n\nChange my mind, but I strongly presume that this was an issue for her from the start, and that her \u201cnot being enthusiastic\u201d was her having a dissenting opinion from the majority in the relationship, because I can\u2019t imagine a scenario where someone cheated on me, and the AP was going to then WORK IN MY HOME, and I agreed all but enthusiasm.\n\nWhy, if you didn\u2019t want this drama, did you, the other person, not imagine what that might feel like and suggest avoiding it altogether anyways?", "YTA clearly you don\u2019t care about your wife\u2019s feelings\u2026she\u2019s not the ONLY nanny if it\u2019s worth your marriage keep the nanny and loose your wife", "NTA. She should have spoken up before you hired her, that's on her. She used the kids to try and manipulate you to do what she wanted without you knowing (also shedding bad light on the nanny that did nothing wrong).

You offered to look for a new nanny, but you\u2019re up against the very real reality that you\u2019re going to need someone to look after your kids while you find someone new. \n\nYour wife acted pretty horribly IMO. I get if she changed her mind - which, hey, we all have a right to do - but the responsible, normal, thing is to go to you and discuss these feelings then come to a solution together. Not pull some manipulative BS with your kids to get you to fire the nanny. That\u2019s just so weird and immature.", "NTA- your wife is her 30s and is not over a boyfriend cheating on her on High school. She needs to grow up and go to therapy asap.

RED FLAG!!!!!", "ESH.", "YTA- She should have never been allowed to nanny after meeting her. The argument is a result of you knowingly continuing to do something your wife was not comfortable with.", "YTA, as soon as it was known how your wife knew her that should have been that.

You guys could\u2019ve met with other possible nannies while your wife decided\u2026 I think she really put you in a bad spot by saying it\u2019s fine, then weaponizing the kids, and then trying to lie about it. Now she doesn\u2019t want Sarah and you guys are stuck. She\u2019s TA.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is the A here. She should have come to you directly when she decided she didn't want Sarah to be the nanny. Idk if you couldn't bend a bit on getting rid of Sarah right away and having a temporary baby sitter but ud say that's pretty minor", "ESH- your wife much more so. Your wife told the kids this nanny was evil, that\u2019s really messed up. \n\nEspecially since this is leaving you without child care until you find a replacement, with you just starting a new role. It may not be the best hill to die on, but it\u2019s not a small thing. M\nThe people who are saying you are picking the nanny have probably never been in this position", "ESH. Your wife handled this in an immature way, but it points to deep issues in the household if one partner thinks they have to orchestrate a weird lie with the kids becauae otherwise their wishes won't be heard or accepted. Your wife should have just felt empowered to get another nanny. You both should have \"veto power\" on people who care for your kids, and a strained personal history is a fine reason to seek another nanny.", "ESH. I would not let someone who cheated with my high-school boyfriend watch my kids and I'm in my 60s. Trust has a baseline. She should have been upfront immediately and you're an asshole for telling her how to feel. She feels a way....not right to mess with the kids but she's more than entitled to her understandable feelings.", "ESH - you\u2019re an AH for letting this woman who kinda violated your wife in the past, and your wife def should not have used/manipulated the kids this way. Just fire the goddamnned nanny, communicate, apologize for doing what you did, express yourselves, and move on. There is a solution here! And sometimes ppl are assholes, so hopefully you guys can work past this and laugh about it someday.", "I'm leaning to ESH for a lot of the reasons listed. Weaponizing the kids is not okay. If your wife normally wouldn't do this, it's a leap to call her controlling, but if this situation has resulted in her acting more insecure than you've seen her, then that's a sign the reality of Sarah's influence in her past was more painful than you are apparently realizing. Which is even more of a reason to get this influence out of your life.\n\nYour refusal to fire the nanny is just feeding the fire. Just fire the nanny. The more you dig your feet in, the more justified she will feel in not having come to you in the first place rather than using the kids.", "ESH\nWife for using your kids to make you think Sarah did something bad when all she did was be a great nanny\nYou for not looking into a new nanny right away cause it will probably cause more issues the longer Sarah stays. Yes the kids love her and she great to them but she caused your wife grief in high school. Both of you need to sit down and talk like adults about this issue.", "ESH. \nIt sounds like your wife\u2019s feelings were disregarded right from the start, even if she said she\u2019d try, you knew the situation and that should have been enough to no hire her in the first place. \nYour wife should not have been saying things to the children. \nEither way, get Sarah out of your house and find a temporary babysitter", "ESH", "ESH your wife is definitely weaponizing the kids and that\u2019s messed up. However she\u2019s uncomfortable with the nanny, and hiring a nanny should have both parents on board. Gently let go of the nanny and make sure she knows it\u2019s not because of her performance.", "ESH - I don't know your wife can't just use her words, but she shouldn't have been weird and sneaky she should have just said no. That said - you are absolutely right she is your kids' parent too and she has an unhappy personal history with Sarah, there is absolutely no reason she should have to have someone who she doesn't like in her house with her kids.

We both work full-time jobs and have three kids, ages 3, 6 and 7.\n\nAt the moment I work from home with flexible hours but I've been offered a promotion which will require me to go to work in person. The pay increase is really significant so my wife and I agreed I should take the promotion and hire a part-time nanny for our kids.\n\nI got in touch with a nanny agency and they matched us to someone who lives local. They only told us her first name which was a really common name anyway, but for the sake of story telling we'll say her name's Sarah.\n\nI spoke to Sarah on the phone and she seemed really nice. We arranged a day for her to come over and meet my wife and the kids and for us to show her around the house.\n\nWhen the day came around and we met her, it turned out that my wife already knew Sarah. It was really awkward. I wasn't sure how they knew each other until afterwards.\n\nMy wife told me that back when she was in high school, her boyfriend at the time cheated on her with Sarah who was in her class.\n\nShe wasn't enthusiastic about it but my wife didn't seem to have a problem with Sarah being our nanny at first. Our kids love her, she has lots of experience and she's available when we need her.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks with pretty much no issues, my two oldest kids come to me and say that they don't want Sarah to come back. I ask them why and they said she's \"evil\". I ask why they think she's evil and our 6 year old starts crying and says that Sarah is mean and wants to hurt mommy.\n\nI talked to my wife in private and at first she said she had no idea what the kids were talking about and that it must be because of something Sarah did. \n\nWhen I pressed it, my wife admitted that she told the kids that Sarah is evil. She said she knows it was a ridiculous plan but she was hoping I'd fire her. My wife asked me to fire the nanny because their history makes her uncomfortable.\n\nI asked why it wasn't an issue before. My wife said she just needed to think about it and she's decided Sarah has to go.\n\nI told my wife that we can find another nanny but until then there's no reason to get rid of Sarah, and that she was out of line for trying to weaponise the kids against her when Sarah is no danger to them.\n\nMy wife disagreed and said that we need to just fire Sarah ASAP and hire a temporary babysitter until we can find another nanny. She said that she wasn't weaponising the kids, she was just setting boundaries.\n\nThis turned into a really heated argument and I called my wife insecure and controlling, and told her she needs to go to therapy. My wife said I'm being inconsiderate of her feelings and need to put myself in her shoes.\n\nThis was one of our biggest arguments in a very long time and I just want a neutral opinion on whether I was wrong.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

However, the way you write \"she wasn't enthusiastic about it but my wife didn't seem to have a problem\", sound like you were rolling over your wife's deep discomfort here.", "NTA. This is crazy. She is upset about something from high school so she traumatized her children? She does need therapy and now your children probably do too. Good luck OP", "ESH\n\nNo matter what she said at the start you should have KNOWN that this wasn\u2019t going to be okay. Image if the roles were flipped.\n\nShe chose to be manipulative when she could have just had a conversation.\n\nYou come out slightly better than her because you suggested therapy, but you\u2019re still both TA.", "NTA. Your wife is manipulative. She either wanted to appear unbothered in front of Sarah so she agreed for her to be hired. Or she wanted to throw her \"better\" life in Sarah's face. All the wile manipulating kids into getting you to fire Sarah so she could save face. I do not agree with coddling adults at the expense of kids. I agree that Sarah needs to go.

She said that she wasn't weaponising the kids, she was just setting boundaries.\n\nWhat boundaries? Your wife lied ***to her children*** because she was upset that the nanny was developing a good relationship with your kids. I think she was jealous and was somehow equating Sarah stealing her HS boyfriend with Sarah \"stealing\" the kid's affections. \n\nThey now think someone they were learning to trust was actually evil and wanted to hurt their mother. That is really sick and your wife was indeed weaponizing the kids. She obviously never stopped to think  how her lies would effect them. \n\nKeeping the nanny around is a bad idea, as that will further upset your children. But finding a new nanny is the least of your worries.\n\nIt sounds like time for some family counseling, and you somehow need to get through to her how her insecurities are negatively impacting your kids. And your own relationship, because if I were in that situation I would begin to worry if my spouse was going to start lying whenever it was convenient or helped her get her way.", "ESH but mostly your wife. Telling her young kids their nanny is \"evil\" over high school drama is weird. I understand it's painful but that's a horrible way to go about it. She should have just talked to you.", "ESH, except the kids. \n\nYour wife should have talked to you directly. Telling the kids \u201cSarah is evil\u201d is bizarre and bad parenting. \n\nYou never should have agreed to having Sarah as the nanny, once you found out about her history with your wife, that\u2019s basic common sense. \n\nGive Sarah a two weeks notice, and look for a new nanny asap.", "She definitely has some insecurities but say you\u2019re sorry and find a new nanny asap.", "LOL at the E S H.

There are plenty of other people you can hire and both of you need to be ok with who is watching your kids.", "ESH Your wife was really wrong to manipulate the kids to get the nanny fired. That was terrible to do to the children. \n\nYou suck because even though your wife needs therapy, and needs to learn to communicate, when you found out there was an issue you should have fired the nanny. There is no gain in traumatizing the kids further. Forcing children to spend time with someone they believe is a bad person is wrong, it doesn't matter if it is true or not. The kids should be the first priority.", "Wow.  There\u2019s a lot to unpack here.  \n\nYour wife should never have involved your children in this, she should have been honest with you about her feelings, she sucks for doing that.  \n\nBut now that you know she\u2019s uncomfortable, and now that your children have been tainted against her, you need to just let her go rather than insisting that she stay until you can find a new nanny.  You suck for letting this woman continue to come to your house and interact with your children.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure if Sarah knew that the guy she was hooking up with in high school was OPs boyfriend, but if she did know, then she sucks, too, and she also sucks for agreeing to take this job.  \n\nBasically ESH.

Your wife needs to work on herself, absolutely. But she doesn't need you to teach her a lesson by hanging onto this particular nanny when doing so is likely to only be negative for the kids and the nanny as well as your wife.

Had you not even told your wife her name? \n\nDo you normally respond to a reasonable request from your wife insults and suggesting she has mental health issues because she does not want a woman who hurt her in her home with her kids?  Your presentation of your wife's response does not have any similar attacks.  Instead she asked you to respect her feelings and to actually put effort into understanding?\n\nFinally, how long have you been sleeping with Sarah?", "ESH\n\nNo respect for cheaters. Nanny is TA for having been one (albeit she was in high school; lots of us did shit in high school that we\u2019re less than proud of now).\n\nYour wife handled her insecurity in a batshit crazy and potentially damaging (to your kids) way. I\u2019d be **furious** if I were you. She\u2019s TA for trying to be clever instead of putting on her big girl pants and having a conversation like an adult.  She\u2019s TA big time for using your children as pawns - that\u2019s lower than low. \n\nBut regardless how stupid her approach was, the damage is done. She has sabotaged your kids\u2019 relationship with this nanny. Forcing them to stay in her care now will only deepen the damage your wife has done. That you\u2019re even considering it makes you also TA. \n\nYour poor children, of course, are not included in this judgement. They\u2019re innocent and blameless and I feel badly for them for being stuck in this situation. \n\nLet the nanny go. Without cause so you don\u2019t fuck up her ability to collect employment insurance (if nannies are even eligible).

What she doesn't wanna tell her kids she LIED about the nanny?.  Also for her suggestion  to pay a babysitter till a new nanny comes is absurd considering the cost.  He might as well quit and tell her make all the money because she caused the situation.  To me there seems little choice atm for him to work and have someone watch the kids.

Keeping Sarah around for a couple weeks more just because you don't want to bother finding someone to fill in until you and your wife find a  permanent replacement is a terrible idea, and it shows your wife and kids you don't give a shit about their feelings.

I\u2019m a former Au Pair, so obviously I\u2019m viewing the situation through a different lens, but I can\u2019t help but be horrified by how this could have destroyed Sarah\u2019s career and reputation. If you hadn\u2019t questioned your wife and if she hadn\u2019t fessed up, how far would this have gone!? \n\nYou need to let Sarah go for *her* good. She\u2019s not safe working for you. And you need to send her off with an absolutely *glowing* reference letter.", "ESH", "ESH\n\nYou kind of edge your wife out just a bit, but two wrongs don't make a right. If your wife had an issue with this woman, and it made her uncomfortable, you should have immediately looked for another nanny. Think about it this way: You decide to hire a gardener that will be at your home several times a week. The guy your wife wants to hire is one who your ex cheated on you with. You'd have a lot of feelings about that and would be just as uncomfortable. What if your wife refused to get rid of him. The most important thing in a marriage is being considerate of each other's feelings and working together. You didn't work with her at all.\n\nThat whole situation led to your wife's reaction with the kids. I'm not justifying it in the least, but she felt backed into a corner and didn't feel like you had her back. Since she was left to defend herself, she tried to find a way of sabatoging the nanny. She decided to drag innocent kids into the mix and use them to try and get rid of the nanny. She knew you weren't listening to her, but using the kids was wrong. Those kids have no idea what's going on and were put in the middle of it anyway.\n\nTalk to your wife and apologize. Tell her you didn't really understand her feelings and made a bad decision. That doesn't make you weak or less of a man. It actually makes you more of a man because you're admitting you made a mistake. Tell her you want to find a solution that works for both of you and you want to talk through it. But do not...I repeat...*do not* say something like \"But what you did was wrong, too.\" Let her own up to it. She may not realize what she did but don't rub her nose in it. Be a man and work with your wife.", "YTA because it literally doesn't matter why she doesn't want that nanny- your wife has the right to feel comfortable with who is looking after her kids.

What you've said is the most ridiculous and absurd thing I have read today and the fact that you're showing your wife such little empathy is incredibly concerning. Get your head out of your ass, you know you should have never hired that woman. Fire her and hire someone else. Acting like there's only 1 babysitter in the word. \n\nEditted to add: I would say ESH but I wonder why your wife didn't feel as if she was able to come and tell you how she felt in the beginning. Yes weaponizing the children was wrong but based on your reaction, I don't believe you've created a space for open communication because look at how you respond when she finally opens up to you. She doesn't tell you, she's the villian, she tells you, you say no. \nWhy do you dislike your wife so much? You honestly sound a bit off. I'm getting a weird vibe.", "ESH ... Actually NTA.  The wife shouldn't have allowed her to be hired in the first place, given the history.  It's not cool to play the \"Well, now that I think about it ...\" thing when kids are involved.  Next, if she wants her gone, she can do the firing, and she can make sure the kids are taken care of, until a new one is hired.  And, she did, indeed, weaponize the kids, which is just insufferable.  She should have dealt with the situation like an adult.

Not fucking cool.  \n\n\nThat being said - what is the biggest reason for not firing Sarah ASAP?", "Your wife IS EVIL wth", "ESH. \n\nIs this the hill you want to die on??\n\nYour wife was out of line speaking to the kids about Sarah.

I understand her not wanting an ex\u2019s affair partner in her home, around her kids and YOU. Telling the kids Sara is evil and wants to hurt your wife is not just setting boundaries. She also should have said no at the start once she realized who Sarah actually was.\n\nMy problem with you is, once you knew their past, you should have just said no to Sarah. And even though your wife at first tolerated the situation, once she came to you and said she was uncomfortable, you should have agreed. Also, flat out saying your wife needs therapy, based solely on what you said in this post, was not necessary. \n\nSarah should have said no to the job up front once she realized who your wife was.

Your wife allowing the affair partner of one of your ex\u2019s into your home on a regular basis, interacting with your kids and your wife. Would you fully trust the man to not overstep? Be honest with yourself. The answer is No. You would not want that man around your family. That is how your wife feels about Sarah. She can never trust that Sarah won\u2019t try something to break up your family. Which brings me to my final question/thought: do you have feelings, thoughts, etc., about Sarah and that\u2019s why you\u2019re digging in your heels to take time to find a new nanny and not let her go right away?", "Step 1 Set up cameras so your wife will file better and step2 \ntell your wife \u201c if she\u2019s over her ex and married to you now why is it a issue..... don\u2019t say nothing walk away after \nStep 3 grab a beer", "Write this woman a glowing reference and let her go.

Their sense of security is the most important thing right now.  They're completely reliant on the adults in their lives and they need to be able to trust that the people who are taking care of them.\n\nAnd make no mistake, your wife *did* weaponize your children.  \"Boundary\" isn't a magic word that transforms any action into an acceptable one.  You need to look really plainly at what this means about her as a parent, that she thought causing her children to feel *very real fear* was a better solution than having a single adult conversation with her husband.\n\nESH, because it's not fair to Sarah or your children to have let the situation continue as it is.

For children that young \"hurt\" would most likely automatically translate to \"physically hurt\". The children will now be more than likely terrified to be left alone with her, despite them having liked her before.  That is manipulation and emotional abuse. You don't have to beat someone into a pulp to deserve the title of an abuser. (And they are clearly too young for a conversation about mummy being an idiot.)\n\nHusband is right.

It's another it pit the kids against the nanny so the husband will fire her. Why didn't she just tell her husband \"husband, I thought  I could do this but I can't.

Also, Sarah didn\u2019t seem to have a problem working for her or her family.  But yeah, telling the kids that Sarah is evil and wants to hurt mommy is incredibly stupid and traumatizing to the kids. OP is being extremely level-headed\u2014if Sarah is good to the children, professional, available, and has let go of the past\u2014then why can\u2019t his childish wife.

Which is why I also get OP wanting to keep Sarah until they can get another nanny.\n\nBut holy fuck she seems to have escalated FAST.

Hell, we don't even know that the \"boyfriend\" knew that he was dating OP's wife, since someone who lies to children about someone wanting to hurt her absolutely seems like the type to lie to her husband about the actual status of a relationship that ended at LEAST twelve years ago.", ">he just needs to listen with his ears.\n\nHe did.

This does not make sense and is an unbelievable leap. However, the sequence of events makes complete sense if you switch \"the wife doesn't mind\" to her discomfort for the nanny was inconvenient for OP so he dismissed it. No clown cars required.

A better example that more accurately reflects what I\u2019m saying is that you bashed a stranger on the street for no reason but that stranger had just kicked a homeless person. Would you still be the asshole for bashing him? Yes. Does it matter whether the stranger kicked a homeless person? Sure\u2026but not for the question being asked. Why? Because you already said yourself that there was no reason that you bashed him. In this case, the wife manipulating her kids is not the reason OP doesn\u2019t want to fire the nanny\u2026which means it\u2019s not relevant to the question of whether he\u2019s being an AH for refusing to fire the nanny.

He said that the meeting with Sarah was awkward, but was that only on his wife's part?   Did Sarah recognize the wife as the wronged girlfriend, or did she have no idea of their past history, i.e., if perhaps she didn't know that the guy was supposed to be the wife's boyfriend?    If they recognized one another, the wife should have explained to Sarah that their history bothered her more than she thought if would, and done the firing herself.", "I could not agree with your post more.

I wouldn't say that makes him an asshole, just naive, really. \n\nNow that the cat's out of the bag and the bag's in the river, the best possible solution is keeping Sarah on until they can find a new nanny. Hell, if they were placed with Sarah through an agency, a simple phone call could likely solve this in relatively short order. A parade of babysitters isn't going to be best for the kids, and the more people you introduce, the more likely you'll end up introducing a non-savory person.\n\nWhere OP's wife crossed the line into YTA was coaching the children to lie about Sarah. I'd be terrified she's even capable of this - it's analogous to parental alienation. What happens if they end up divorcing?
