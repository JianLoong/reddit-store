In the last month she has been rapidly getting worse and her doctor has said she will probably not make it to Christmas.\n\nMy wife (42F) went to seek another opinion and found a doctor that believes he can preform a procedure (sensitive, won\u2019t go into specifics) that may extend my MILs life by up to three months.

Nice manipulation.\n\nNow actually don't think that spending 93% of your savings for a possibility of 3 months is really good because after this 3 months she's going to go downhill. That's horrible that says if she's not going to get better and this is the last chance guess possible and enjoy the time she has left.\n\nN t a for not wanting your wife to spend that money but yta big manipulative about the whole thing especially with your judgment", "YTA\n\nIt's obviously your wife's savings account, you haven't contributed to it at all, and it doesn't affect your finances AT ALL. \n\nYou however became a **HUGE** A H for this *\"and sure, her mother was mainly absent because she was working 2 jobs to support her family of five as a single mother.\"* You had the nerve to call your MIL and \"absent mother\" when in reality she was a VERY present mother, just a poor, single mother, having to work 2 jobs to support her children. Way to try to twist a narrative that was disgenous.", " I assume her mum is keen to try the procedure. \n\nPersonally, if faced with paying for it, I wouldn\u2019t go through it for 3 months. I\u2019ve seen a lot of cancer-related death and quantity, doesn\u2019t always beat quality. Even if free, I\u2019m not sure I would do it.\n\nBut ultimately it\u2019s her, and then your wife\u2019s decision.\n\nIt could mean she\u2019s subject to longer life, but potentially crappier life. Has that conversation been had? Also, if going for treatment outside of insurance, her insurers may then not pay for subsequent care? They could argue, if successful, they won\u2019t cover her other treatments or end of life care as she prolonged it out of her insurance, Another thing to check.", "You describe the account as \"[wife's] savings.\" So it's hers to spend and her decision. Whether MIL was an absent parent is hardly relevant. How will it work out if your wife doesn't go through with it because of you and then MIL dies right away? Might not be so great for your marriage. YTA", "No death is easy, and family does not and cannot let go easily even if the parent has been absent. \n\nOP is also right to want to protect his wife. In the long run however, after loss and trauma the survivors always ask if what they did was enough. \n\nSo if there is a pool of savings that can be used to safely prolong life for even three months, and the wife wants to take it, and not to mention, the savings are her own, she should.\n\nSo, YTA.", "YTA.  What do you mean \"who was absent for most of her childhood\" and then later admit it was because she was working two jobs to feed the children.  What's wrong with you?  Because she worked so hard she doesn't deserve to live? \n\nI get that 3 more months for your MIL isn't worth it to you BUT, it IS worth it to your wife.  And as you point out, it is her money that she brought to the marriage.  And you even mention there's more in the joint account.\n\nI dunno.  I wonder if you are just trolling us, but if you aren't... maybe your wife isn't buying the 3 months as much as she is buying peace of mind, which could carry her for decades. \n\nI think you should stay out of it.", "YTA.\n\nIt's her mother and her money. Interfere, and in your wife's mind, you'll forever be responsible for her mother's premature death. If you want to remain married, do NOT die on this hill.", "YTA. It's her money, not yours/shared, so it isn't a joint decision. \n\nBut you're possibly an even bigger AH for trying to paint her as an absentee parent when she was actually just busy trying to put food on the table with two jobs...that's not a deadbeat, quit trying with that narrative.", "I get where you are coming from since it sounds super risky, but I think you also should try to walk in your wife\u2019s shoes.  She wants to prolong her mothers life and have more time with her.  If I could empty my savings for 1 day to three more months with a loved one that passed away I would do it in a heart beat.

No amount of money would stand in my way to have my mother possibly live even just a millisecond longer. Shame on you.\n\nETA: you can ALWAYS make more money. Her mother won\u2019t be here much longer to make more memories with. That\u2019s more important than freaking money.", "YTA. This isn\u2019t about the money.

Let her do it with your blessing.", "this is satire, right? the way you call her mother and absentee and then turn around and say \u201csure, we can easily afford it and her mother sacrificed years of her life struggling to care for her children, but i don\u2019t care!\u201d really reads like a joke.\n\ni\u2019m choosing to believe you\u2019re not a real person, but in this story YTA for sure. you fucking suck, dude.", "YTA. Have you ever considered that situations like this are *exactly* what a savings account is for? We save for emergencies and unexpected situations. \n\nSounds like there's still enough money for the kids, plus you each have over 20 years worth of work left.", "YTA. It\u2019s her money, it\u2019s her mother. To get even a few more days with a loved one is priceless. And to tell her you think her mother is taking advantage of her is kinda cruel. As you said yourself, she was a single mother raising five kids. She wasn\u2019t absent because she abandoned them- she was sacrificing immeasurably for her children and now your wife wants to do the same for her. She\u2019s not trying to spend your family\u2019s last penny on this treatment and she\u2019s not putting you into insane medical debt. She\u2019s trying to get one more christmas with her mother.", "YTA and absolutely disgusting", "I would give anything to have my mom for 3 more months. It\u2019s not up to you. YTA.", "Are you saying that if you had a terminal illness with a one month expectancy, and there was a possibility to extend your life, you would rather your wife or children should measure it against the dollars they\u2019d save?\n\nNow, if I were in MiL\u2019s position would I let my daughter spend a large amount just to prolong my 82 year old life a few months? No I would not. However this is important to your wife, so pull up your big boy pants and be support her in this very difficult time. This is about her losing her mother - the woman who worked two jobs to support your wife and her siblings.", "Whoa you sound like a manipulative A H\u2026 with no comprehension or regard to the value that lies in time with loved ones, or a single mother caring and providing for her children to the best of her abilities.. so out of touch!

It\u2019s not your relationship to judge. It sounds like your finances are separate\u2014or at least have some separation. It\u2019s her choice and likely complicated and difficult.", "YTA. Your savings account is more important than her mother. If you get your way, your wife will hold it against you forever.", "I get where you're coming from if her mom wasn't a good parent and is taking advantage of her. But think of how your wife will feel if she doesn't do this, and think of how she'll feel about you if you try to stop her. YTA.", "yta. it's selfish to prioritize money over someone's life. you can always make more money, but you can't bring back someone who's gone.", "INFO: so this is your wife\u2019s personal savings account (presumably existed prior to you marrying)? If that\u2019s the case, and it\u2019s not a joint family savings account, YTA most definitely.", "Guess the big question did anyone ask MIL what she wants?

You sound like a manipulative AH. It\u2019s her money, she can do whatever she wants with it. Second, her mother didn\u2019t abandon her. Her mother was working two damn jobs to support her children.

You forcing her to not do this will cause big time resentment.", "Are we talking $10,000 or $100,000?", "Her money, her mother. YTA", "**NAH**   You clearly have some negative feelings about your MIL, feelings that may in fact be justified.   Your feelings won't change anything about your wife's perspective.   You are probably right about the questionable value of the treatment.   It's her money though, leave it to her to spend as she wishes.\n\nI think you should be more concerned about what will happen when your MIL does go.  If you stop your wife, she'll blame herself for not doing *everything* she could to \"save\" her.   If she gets a few extra months, it might make it easier for your wife to let go without guilt.", "NTA but your wife is being TA, even if she doesn't mean to be.

Your wife should not be spending her savings to prolong her mother's life for just 3 months. It doesn't make sense, and your MIL will spend her last days recovering from a risky surgery and then dying instead of spending whatever time left with her children and grandchildren.  However,  you advised her, and it's up to her to follow your advice or ignore it. Support her whatever her decision.

She was probably great, hence w is having a hard time letting her go right now. Everyone experiences grief differently.

But he was convinced the chemo would miraculously cure her. Because God. She did not make it to three years. Sadly, my mom was also miserable and sickly the entire time and could not see her grandkids hardly ever, bc Chemo. So, she sadly spent her last few momenta alone in a f'g hospital getting poison in her arm instead of peacefully being drugged on pain killers holding her grand-babies. I would not want her to have these false hope and drain her account either. But, it is her mother. If she will feel guilty forever for not trying every possible thing, you may just need to let her do what she feels she must. But, I would also have her think about, if the surgery doesn't work?
