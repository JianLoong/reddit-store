I\u2019m 21 and have a really close family. We always did Christmas at my grandmas house but she passed away last January and so there was a lot of discussion as to who would do the dinner.\n\nMu opinion was it would be best to have one of the younger people do it that way we can have a long standing tradition that last years. There was some arguing back and forth between my and my aunt but finally she said \u201cfine.\u201d I was kind of thinking my 29 year old cousin would step up since she has a really nice house and kitchen but then she said she would be going to Germany this year. Finally after a month of no one volunteering my mom said I\u2019d really pissed my aunt off and I needed to do Christmas this year since I was so adamant about a young person doing it. I was not going to be proved wrong so I said I would. \n\nSo a couple of things. Im a good cook so I\u2019m not worried about that part. But it\u2019s WAY more expensive than I thought it would be, especially with inflation. I also realized that my apartment is way too small so I rented a really nice Airbnb for the day. And I had to buy all new dishes, cookware, serving ware, table spread etc\u2026 this is going to cost me about $4500 that is going on my credit card.\n\nWe are having between 20 and 25 people and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to ask them to pay between $250 and $300each so I\u2019m not financially ruined by this. Im a first year teacher and I can\u2019t afford that.\n\nWhen I told my mom about the idea she said don\u2019t you dare even consider it. Her argument was it was my idea and I even arguged with my aunt, all my grandmas stuff packed up and in great shape\u2026I didn\u2019t need fo get a whole new \u201cspread\u201d from pottery barn and why didn\u2019t I just ask someone else to host and I could cook and that my grandma never once asked for anything in return so this could \u201csplinter\u201d the family.\n\nShe said \u201cadmit you bit off more than you could chew, take everything back, cancel the Airbnb and ask for help with hosting and cooking.\u201d I said no I could do but I needed money. She said I was embarrassing \u201cthe hell\u201d out of her and she may not come.\n\nYour own mom threatening to not come to your Christmas is making me feel like an asshole.

Nobody needs to finance your new dishes, or your desire to host somewhere not your home.  If you're worried about the actual cost of the meal, ask people to contribute some food.  I've never actually attended a holiday meal with family where people weren't asked to contribute in some way (bringing food, or beer, dessert, etc).", "YTA.\n\nYou fucked around and found out. \n\nThis is all on you, and you\u2019d be absolutely ridiculous to ask your family for money to host Christmas. \n\nHosting is hard, exhausting, and expensive. Never take it for granted again, and be a stellar guest going forward.", "YTA. Every single cost that you listed was a choice you made of your own volition.", "You are definitely the asshole. Your desire to create a long standing tradition was lovely, but renting an airbnb and charging people $200 is going to create a very different kind of tradition than you expected. Holy hell don't do it. YTA\n\nCall your aunt and appologize. Cancel the Airbnb. Return any of the dishes and purchases that you can. Pay the credit card debt off slowly and steadily and use it as a reminder of the dangers of  bulldozing yourself and others in the pursuit of a dream \"event.'", "YTA - why didn\u2019t you just throw a new house for yourself onto the list and share that cost with your family too?! \n\nYour mom is 100% right and you\u2019re a thousand percent wrong.", "YTA.\n\n\nWhy should they pay for things you chose to buy and that you will keep?\n\nYou got yourself in this situation.", "YTA this actually has me just laughing away on my couch. First of you get into a huge weird argument about only a young person hosting. Secondly you get stuck with the hosting duties you argued so hard for. Then you think you need to buy expensive pottery barn dishware and somehow in your head you decide your guest should help pay for said costs. Oh karma has bitten you so hard \ud83d\ude02 time to eat some humble pie and ask for help!!", "YTA, Hosting a party does not mean charging your guests hundreds of dollars. Your mother is right that you do not need to buy a new spread, rent an airbnb, etc...\n\nPerhaps you now realize the reason why family holidays are generally hosted by more established members of the family. They tend to have bigger homes for hosting, China sets, and the cash to buy a large meal.\n\nTime to swallow your pride and apologize", "YTA. You fought hard for a younger person taking over the tradition without thinking that most younger family members don't have the space, china, etc to host a large family gathering. I can understand suggesting a younger person if you were nominating yourself, but you don't have the room or the supplies. Fighting for a younger person, when you meant your cousin specifically and she's not even available this year, was a major error in judgement. Buying all of the stuff, renting an airbnb, and deciding to charge for the Christmas experience we're all major errors in judgement.\n\nDo the reasonable thing: return all the stuff, cancel the Airbnb, and apologize to your aunt.", "YTA \n\nYou bit off more than you could chew.\n\nThis should\u2019ve been planned and agreed to, asking everyone a week before Christmas to find an extra $150 is unreasonable.", "YTA, you did bit off more than you could chew. Also, as your mom stated, you could have asked for help, but you didn't. You still can, but your pride is more important apparently. As your mom stated, return the expensive \"spread\", use ur grandma's China and maybe reach ot to your Unt, apologize and see if you can host it together. Isn't Christmas about family after all?", "YTA\n\nMy God what the hell did I just read? Your a teacher? You are so way off base here I don't even understand how you think any of this is OK ar all. \n\nAlso, why wouldn't you use grandma's stuff if you are so connected to the traditional aspect of this grand Christmas dinner? \n\nDamn.", "YTA. You went wayyyyy overboard. Do what your mom said and admit your mistakes and make it a cooperative effort.", "$200 PER PERSON??????? Wow, that's.....harsh.  I mean, I've cooked for that many people and a full-on spread with gobs of food and desserts. And AT MOST I spent MABYE $25 per person.  AT THE MOST.  If they are \"family\" and they are happy to be together, then serve on disposables.  If they are happy to be with you, then that is supposed to be the priority.  If they are there to be impressed, then they aren't family.  Our family is large and loud and very glad to be together.  Even if we have to jam together into a single room.  And eat on disposables.  What's the priority here? Impressing them or enjoying the love of family?", "YTA - you volunteered to host Christmas so you could your aunt wrong but you didn\u2019t even have dishes?! That was just dumb. This is your mess. \n\nAlso, you dont invite people over for a holiday dinner and charge them.", "YTA. In itself, it wouldn't make you an asshole to ask people to contribute if it's a large gathering, but everything else in the post does:\n\n1)  You aggressively pushed your own view onto your family without really wanting to take responsibility for the consequences (you thought another younger relative would be hosting the party).\n\n2) Your view itself is pretty insensitive and cold: you're essentially telling your older family members that they shouldn't hold gatherings anymore because (according to you) they will die soon anyway. Not to mention it is also impractical: someone who is retired but in good health will probably have more time, enthusiasm and resources to organise something like this than younger relatives (as you yourself have now discovered).\n\n3) Finally, you're asking them to pay a crazy amount of money. Do you really think it's reasonable to pay more for a family dinner than for dining at a Michelin-star restaurant, lol?", "Yta\u2026. And not very bright. Your mom is 100% spot on.", "YTA. You can't afford to host Christmas if this is your plan. Also, $250 -$300 per person is absolutely ridiculous; you don't get to ask guests for money anyway but even if you did, that amount is exorbitant.", "YTA. Don\u2019t misunderstand me, I see nothing wrong with people contributing to a large family dinner. But you bought new dishes and expect the family to help cover the cost? You didn\u2019t state in advance what you expected of family members if you did host ( seems like your grandma always covered the cost )? And $150 a person for a Christmas meal?? Your mom is right. Admit you didn\u2019t grasp how big the undertaking is, swallow your pride and ask for help.", "YTA. You definitely bit off more than you could chew. You offered a solution, then expected someone else to do Christmas, when it sounds like your aunt was just fine doing. Foot. Mouth. Suck it up.", "Whaa????! YTA \nI\u2019m not sure if this is a troll because it\u2019s so outrageous.\nSo many things wrong. Your mom was right the first time. You can\u2019t make a demand and then expect someone else to fill it. Also your point was stupid. I think what you\u2019re saying is you want it to be at one persons house so it\u2019s the same \u201ctradition\u201d every year but they need to be young because they would live longer. You don\u2019t want your aunt because you essentially said she\u2019s old as dirt and will die too soon/shortly. What\u2019s wrong with you? It\u2019s like you\u2019re a narcissist. \n\nTHEN, you went to a crazy, CRAZY extravagance to host. Almost everything you did was totally unnecessary.  It\u2019s like a keeping up with the Jones. Look, broke people have a broke people Christmas. You live within your means. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s terrible. Christmas is about the joy in family and friendship and not about themed plates, fancy place and expensive food. My family was so poor growing up we sometimes didn\u2019t have anything to eat but at Christmas we would have tomato soup and grilled cheese. As much as you could eat. And it was a feast! Then played games and opened gifts and watched Christmas movies. I never even knew people were actually doing fancy dinners with turkey until college. I thought it was only in movies. To this day we still do soup and grilled cheese because that\u2019s the tradition we enjoy, albeit with nicer ingredients.\n\nWell, since you stuck your foot in it and are hosting, you should\u2019ve asked to host at someone else\u2019s, made it a potluck, apologized to your aunt for being TA. Everything you did is to reflect on YOU and how YOU want to look great. You may have egomania. At least we know you aren\u2019t teaching finance.", "Yta, why would a 21 year old buy stuff from Pottery Barn and Williams Sonoma? It's expensive and clearly you can't afford it. So if you charge these people $200 a piece do they get to take a pan and a plate set home with them? Ridiculous. You do not charge your guests the pleasureeeeeee of your cooking in overly priced pots and pans. If you want a lasting tradition you need to make sure it's sustainable. Your plan is clearly not. Return the shit you bought and let your \"old\"aunt host. \n\nIf my 21 year old cousin offered to host, I would expect paper plates and a crowded apartment. Don't try to compete with the big dogs that have the money to host the way you expect. You aren't there yet and it's fine. Just don't be an ass and ask people to pay for a party you are hosting.", "YTA, girl buy some paper plates or something. You literally fought and argued for this, and are mad it's now on your shoulders. Why in the world are you spending money on all this extra shit when you say you're financially struggling just to prove a point? Your mom points out you can just use your grandmother's stuff and instead of going with that, you have a fit about doing it your way and blowing an obscene amount of money on a family dinner. \n\nI'm also curious where the extra cost is coming from. $4500 split among 20 people is $225, among 25 people it's $180. It sounds like you're also trying to fleece your family for extra money.", "YTA. How in the fuck? You could get this catered and it would be cheaper. But then you wouldn\u2019t get a new set up cookware and a nice week in an Airbnb that everyone else pays for. Oh. I see what you did there. Again. YTA.", "YTA. When you host, those things are your responsibility. If you didn\u2019t have cookware that is your problem, it is absolutely nuts to ask then to pay those things. If you didn\u2019t have the space to host, nobody twisted your arm into the AirBnB.", "YTA. You made unnecessary decisions when it came to hosting/location/supplies that could have easily been avoided. No one should pay for your hallmark christmas catalog party essentially when your aunt had the means. She just was too old.....???????? To host", "YTA. You brought this whole mess upon yourself because of your pointless ego. Either admit your mistake and let someone take over or suck it up and eat dirt and grass to pay for your stubbornness.", "LOL of course YTA! Your mother is absolutely 100000% correct in saying you bit off more than you could chew. You apparently hadn't even thought out the total logistics of something you ***clearly*** didn't understand the total weight of, and now you're too full of pride to admit you didn't know what you were doing.\n\nEither back down and ask for help (NOT monetarily!!) And try to salvage the holiday dinner YOU ruined, or stay the asshole. \n\nEither way you should definitely learn from this and you owe your aunt and mother a sincere apology. Don't let pride ruin that, too.\n\nETA: honest question OP, would *you* attend a holiday hosted by your cousin if she asked a $300 admittance fee?? Or would you want your own mother to be charged that for attending a \"family\" event?", "You\u2019re insane to think this is an appropriate course of action. I\u2019m with your mom - I\u2019d be so embarrassed if my kid tried to pull some bullshit like this. Your debt for trying to prove how \u201csuperior\u201d you are is not your family\u2019s problem. That\u2019s a you problem. If you don\u2019t like the debt, cancel the AirBnb, take back what you bought to host, and ask someone else to do it. Get off your high horse, OP. YTA.", "YTA. You went way overboard, started an argument in the hope that your older cousin would take on all the work, and now you\u2019re too proud to just admit you were wrong.", "Yta your mother is asolutely right. You are absolutely ridiculous", "YTA. No one's gonna come and you'll be stuck with the bill and a ton of food that'll just go to waste. Admit you took on more than you could handle and just take the stuff back. There's no shame in that.", "Yikes, YTA. You're not only in over your head, but you're making an admittedly poor financial decision that is completely unnecessary and will probably take serious time to repay given your career status. \nDon't let your ego and pride get in the way of sense.", "Your mother pretty much said it all. You took on the task because of ego and didn't take the time to consider the expenses involved. That's on you. It's tacky as fuck to charge guests/family for a family dinner you suggested. Especially trying to charge them so last minute. \n\nYTA.", "Yikes. You can\u2019t invite people to dinner and do them dirty like this. You should be embarrassed. Listen to your Mama. YTA.", "YTA\n\nYour first point was stupid. Sure, putting a 70yo to host is not the best decision, but your 38yo aunt?? The point is that she probably has a stablished house, with a plan and everything that goes with it. \n\nThen you found out how expensive was everything and instead of asking for help/backtrack, you doubled down. You are 21, enough to have basic common sense. Why tf did  you buy a new set of silverware?\n\nAnd who is going to pay 250-300? I tell you, no one. Moreover when you tried to make it a question of \u201cwho\u2019s right\u201d and didn\u2019t ask for ANY input. \n\nReturn everything and say you are sorry. If not, enjoy your the debt your ego caused", "YTA\n\nI'm not sure which part is funnier,  that you don't consider you 38 year old aunt to be \"young enough\" to begin and maintain a long running tradition,  that you assumed another cousin would step up because she has a nice kitchen or that you think an airbnb and $300 a plate family dinner should be the tradition.\n\nThe fact that you think your family should subsitize your new table and dishes is definitely funny,  though.", "YTA. You definitely bit off more than you can chew. If you want to recoup your losses (or some of it) put your pride aside. Return the dishes, cancel the Airbnb, and apologize to your aunt and ask her to help. If not, don\u2019t expect anyone to give you a dime as reimbursement for your hosting the dinner.", "YTA. Eat your words, apologize, do not go into debt over this.", "YTA\n\nYou fought to do this and then ran yourself into debt. You went way overboard with all of the things your purchased. You\u2019re essentially asking your family to finance all your new purchases. You brought this on yourself and now want to charge your family for something you fought for. \n\nIt\u2019s a huge undertaking and I understand not being fully aware of everything involved. Instead of pushing for a new tradition and insisting that the younger people should take it over you should\u2019ve looked at the situation to see if it was even feasible. You said you had a particular cousin in mind but did you ever speak to them beforehand? You wanted to make this decision for the family but put no forethought or planning into any of it. Then you double down by going and spending a bunch of money that you don\u2019t have and want to be reimbursed for it. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with what you suggested or wanting to create new traditions. However, you needed to actually have a plan. You didn\u2019t. Now you\u2019re in debt and want the family to pay for it. Poor planning on your part does not constitute an emergency for your family. You stepped in and it\u2019s on you to fix it. Ask for help and return all of the purchases.", "YTA did you ever contribute to your grandmother and offer her money? I doubt it\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have been so adamant it be a young person to host and then become so distressed once you volunteered. \n\nWhy don\u2019t you let your aunt take it this year as she wishes and then you wouldn\u2019t need to carry the financial burden of hosting?", "YTA\n\nFirst of all, you should have thought better before arguing with your aunt. You didn't have a reason!! You didn't want to host the dinner yourself, you're hoping \"your cousin steps up\". That's very rude. Your cousin gracefully avoided the disaster by planning something abroad lol.\n\nSecond, clearly you aren't ready. You're young, your place is small, your salary isn't fantastic... but you are so stubborn!!! You cannot do it yourself, but your stubbornness prevents you from asking for help.\n\nIt's time you stop acting like a baby, and grow up.\n\nStart by admitting your mistake. It's hard, it hurts, but it all starts here. Then, go apologize to the aunt. Clearly your aunt has the space and is ready to continue the tradition. It seems she wants to, as well. \n\nSo, here is your way out. Bite your tongue and go apologize. Admit you're in way over your head, and ask the aunt to host together (she can host, you can both cook, you can reuse grandma's dishes).\n\nIt's not too late. Don't make a fool out of yourself.", "Why the fuck did you do all that? No one asked for a 5k fuckin holiday stay. Most of the time, the building a holiday is held in doesnt cost a dime because it\u2019s someone house. You\u2019re an idiot and YTA", "YTA - my jaw dropped, literally, I\u2019m sitting here with my mouth open. \n\nHow could you even think going to these lengths and then charging the family to attend was remotely appropriate? I\u2019d take your mother\u2019s advice and reach out to the family that has room to host and hope they accept.", "YTA. First of all, your argument that a \u201cyoung person\u201d should host Christmas to keep a long-standing tradition is a ridiculous one, especially when made to someone who is only 38. I am 40 with a two-year-old. Do you think I am geriatric? And why did you need to go to Pottery Barn to buy dishes? Asking people to spend $250 to attend a Christmas dinner that you argued to have with offensive and ageist insinuations would make you look like a total asshole who had no idea what you were talking about, which you didn\u2019t.", "Nope. You fucked around and insisted, now you found out.\n\nHave YOU ever been charged $1 to eat at your aunt\u2019s house? Never mind $300.\n\nYTA all through this story.\n \nAssuming your cousin would do what you insisted on, and then getting an AirBnB for the day. JFC.", "YTA. Your mother is right, you had a fantasy and decided to live by it. Reality came and punched you in the face.\n\nA lot of people told you not to do it, but you insisted. It's all on you.\n\nGood luck.", "YTA. And this is 100% a you on you crime. Either accept the consequences of your own actions or get over yourself and do what your mom says and ask for help. $4500 for a 20 person Christmas? PLS. I hope you don't teach finance or economics. Yikes.", "Im sorry but yta. If you cant host it then ask someone else to.", "Yta. And what have I just read. I can\u2019t believe this is real.", "YTA you demanded a young person host assuming that one of your cousins would take on the expense. Now you got your wish because you are to host the dinner. You are completely delusional if you think anyone is going to reimburse you for the air bnb or the costs of your pots and pans. Either swallow the costs or go back to your mother and aunt and admit you were wrong. That you cannot handle hosting and ask one of them to take over. No one and I mean absolutely no one is going to pay $300 to attend your Christmas dinner.", "You've got yourself in a right old pickle there! I thought you might need to ask some guests to maybe bring wine or pudding, or something, but no, you have chosen to put $4,500 on a credit card for one day! You are daft getting yourself into that mess, pay it off as fast as possible or the interest will build and build. Also, YTA for the way you have spoken to your family.", "Are we allowed to allege that a post is fake due to the ridiculous nature of it? If so, this one.", "Oh fuck off you wanted nice and expensive shit that you otherwise would not be able to afford like from the pottery barn.", "YTA.\n\nAdult decisions come with adult consequences. You argued on behalf on someone who wasn\u2019t interested in the first place, agreed to something  out stubbornness, and now want everyone to pay for the check you yourself wrote.\n\nIf you want people to treat you like an adult then act like an adult. The mature, adult thing to do is apologize and admit when you are wrong and need help.\n\nChildren believe adults can do everything and anything by themselves. Adults understand that no one does everything alone. They are kind enough to give assistance when possible and confident enough to ask for it when needed.\n\nDon\u2019t start your adult years by continuing to be a child. Swallow your pride and talk to your aunt.", "YTA.  Your ego got you into this mess. If you request the money, this is how it will play out. Aunt will decide you're ridiculous (I mean your mom already does). Aunt will decline your dinner and opt to have her own amd open/free for anyone that wants to come.  Others in the family will skip your, save maybe your parents. You'll still be on the hook for all your unneeded expenses. On the plus side, you'll have a lot of leftovers.", "YTA. Why didn't you just ask to use your grandma's tableware for this occasion? You know you're broke and have no space. Buying expensive stuff from *Williams Sonoma and Pottery Barn* (that part truly blows my mind - I'm 33 and have a decent-paying job, and I STILL don't buy stuff there unless I have a gift card) was straight-up stupid. If you really wanted to have your own stuff, there are cheaper options. My IKEA plates are nice and they've lasted me just over a decade now. You fucked around and now you're finding out.", "YTA\n\nThere are so many issues here:\n\n1. Your aunt isn't that old, so will probs be able to host Christmas for a good few years to come.\n2. She probs would have hosted Christmas for free.\n3. You argued for you own way, but thought a different family member would take on the responsibility (despite a willing and able family memeber having already offered)\n4. You knew your place was too small to host.\n5. You decided to rent an air b&b instead of admitting you couldn't host, without asking your family first if they can/ are willing to help pay the costs. \n6. You decided you needed new stuff (when you could have used your families support and asked someone to bring additional crockery/cutlery etc.)\n7. You think your family, who had a pretty decent alternative (your aunt hosting) should now pay a silly amount because you are too immature to admit you were wrong.\n8. This tradition that you've tried to create isnt sustainable, thus isn't going to be a tradition, which means all of this has been for nothing. \n\nThere were so many times you could have swallowed your pride asked for help. You need to throw the towel in, get refunds, and speak to your family about how you messed up and need help.", "YTA\u2026. So you\u2019re going to volunteer the \u201cyoung people\u201d to do it, but of course as one of those \u201cyoung people\u201d, didn\u2019t  want to be bothered to do it yourself or intend to volunteer originally. I gotta say. I\u2019m absolutely baffled. Because it\u2019s not like your boomer old aunt forced it upon you. It was like\u2026. Literally your idea, that you pushed upon your family\u2026. And then didn\u2019t want to take part yourself. \n\nAnd then to pull the rest of that bullshit? Close family my left ass cheek lol. I\u2019m flabbergasted.", "YTA. And I think you\u2019ll find that it won\u2019t just be your mom that doesn\u2019t come\u2014no one is going to agree to those charges, particularly to cover expensive dishware and an Airbnb. I wouldn\u2019t even be surprised to find there\u2019s a secret alternative meal at your aunt\u2019s if you even breathe this plan to the rest of the family. \n\nYour mom is entirely correct. Return the items, cancel the Airbnb, and maybe check and see if someone else will host.", "yta. you thought you knew what was best and now the cost is biting you in the ass. your grandmother just died and you decided to use this time to argue with your aunt and cash out on something someone else in your family could and would do for free. if you don't see how entitled and selfish you are don't be surprised if your family starts a new tradition that doesn't involve you.", "Wow. YTA- you\u2019re 21, how old exactly is your mother and your family that you\u2019ve deemed too old to be able to continue the traditions you want for long enough?! \n\nWow. I just cannot even believe a word of this, you\u2019re either a really bad writer, that definitely needs to get some more realistic ideas\u2026 or a total dick.", "Sorry but, yes, YTA. First off, if you weren\u2019t in a position to host Christmas this year, then you should have excused yourself from the discussion of who should host. You thought your cousin would do it? Obviously without discussing with said cousin. I would have gone to Germany too. It\u2019s a total AH move to, even in your own head, volunteer someone else for that type of duty. Secondly, renting an airbnb and buying dishes from Pottery Barn and Williams Sonoma?!!  Really?  Then expecting your family to pay for dishes you\u2019ll be keeping for your own use for years to come?! Yeah, as my grandmother would say, \u201cThat\u2019s some sh*t!\u201d Cxl the Airbnb and ask forgiveness from your older relatives who would most likely be able to pull this off with much less expense.

I\u2019m 21 and have a really close family. We always did Christmas at my grandmas house but she passed away last January and so there was a lot of discussion as to who would do the dinner.\n\nMu opinion was it would be best to have one of the younger people do it that way we can have a long standing tradition that last years. There was some arguing back and forth between my and my aunt but finally she said \u201cfine.\u201d I was kind of thinking my 29 year old cousin would step up since she has a really nice house and kitchen but then she said she would be going to Germany this year. Finally after a month of no one volunteering my mom said I\u2019d really pissed my aunt off and I needed to do Christmas this year since I was so adamant about a young person doing it. I was not going to be proved wrong so I said I would. \n\nSo a couple of things. Im a good cook so I\u2019m not worried about that part. But it\u2019s WAY more expensive than I thought it would be, especially with inflation. I also realized that my apartment is way too small so I rented a really nice Airbnb for the day. And I had to buy all new dishes, cookware, serving ware, table spread etc\u2026 this is going to cost me about $2500 that is going on my credit card.\n\nWe are having between 20 and 25 people and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to ask them to pay between $150 and $200 each so I\u2019m not financially ruined by this. Im a first year teacher and I can\u2019t afford that.\n\nWhen I told my mom about the idea she said don\u2019t you dare even consider it. Her argument was it was my idea and I even arguged with my aunt, all my grandmas stuff packed up and in great shape\u2026I didn\u2019t need fo get a whole new \u201cspread\u201d from pottery barn and why didn\u2019t I just ask someone else to host and I could cook and that my grandma never once asked for anything in return so this could \u201csplinter\u201d the family.\n\nShe said \u201cadmit you bit off more than you could chew, take everything back, cancel the Airbnb and ask for help with hosting and cooking.\u201d I said no I could do but I needed money. She said I was embarrassing \u201cthe hell\u201d out of her and she may not come.\n\nYour own mom threatening to not come to your Christmas is making me feel like an asshole.

There is a lot of talk about family and tradition but the core values seem to be missing in OPs quest to be right. And it all began when she argued about hosting w her aunt when she didn\u2019t actually want to host. So many wrong turns in this process. Grow up, admit you bit off more than you could chew and try to save this holiday.

My partner and I are slowly building up our \"hosting\" items, and have hosted small gatherings.\n\n(We haven't been seriously asked to take over for Christmas dinner, just theoretical questions of who will take over when my grandma/aunt and my MIL no longer want to host)", "The priority is being right.", "Yes!

If there's family flying in or coming from far out, or even just someone who wants to drink and crash, putting a chunk towards what you'd otherwise pay towards hotels and stay there for the night is a pretty decent offer, with the host picking up the rest. If the place is big enough to host a large dinner, there's likely a few bedrooms too.\n\nIf OP actually was communicating with everyone, as you should as a host, they'd know there was already plates. If you aren't a big dog yet, it's better for everyone involved to be nice to the pack than try to fight to be the head of it.\n\nYTA.", "It\u2019s a day not a week.", "Meanwhile, the aunt is 38. 38, apparently, is too old to host a family dinner.", "38, older than dirt. \ud83d\ude44", "Everyone knows that once you get to 30 you become decrepit and useless to society.

They rent a meeting room for like $200. This is ridiculous", "Agreed. The reason older people always host is because over the years they have collected the crystal, china, silverware and serving pieces needed to do so, and often live in a home large enough to accommodate family. They also know how to host properly without managing to come across like an aggressive little know-it-all. \n\nOP's family is going to laugh in their face when they ask the family for several hundred dollars each and it's unlikely they'll comply.

OP spent $4500, which is dumb to begin with. But on the low end of what she wants, 20 people giving $250 each is $5000. If you have 25 giving $300 it\u2019s $7500. OP doesn\u2019t want to just be reimbursed, but paid.", "Thank you! POTTERY BARN?! I couldn\u2019t read anymore after that. What a clueless and entitled brat. Inflation has nothing to do with it. OP could\u2019ve used grandma\u2019s old supply and made a choice not to do so and now they want everyone else to pay for their irresponsible spending. Wow. The brazen audacity. Return the stuff.
