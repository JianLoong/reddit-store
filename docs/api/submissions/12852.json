Dad ended the marriage and mom tried to make him responsible for her baby with another guy.

He has never met her and has made sure there's no contact there between them.\n\nFive years ago mom got very sick and was in hospital for 3 months. My half sister spent that time in foster care because our grandparents were told they were too sick (multiple chronic health issues between them) to take care of her when they had no idea how long mom would be out of commission. They asked dad to step up but he said no.

We already didn't think much of mom but after that we asked dad to try and get full custody of us, but when we were interviewed we had mentioned the affair, and it was asked whether dad tried to turn us against mom, and we decided to keep 50/50 to not get him into trouble.

They were talking badly about dad, said he was evil and that he \"left his own daughter to rot in foster care\" and I told them she isn't his daughter and DNA proved that. They backtracked and said he left his kids' sister to rot. I said she was nothing to do with him. Then I called them out for being assholes to him when mom cheated on him with two guys and fought to make him responsible for her child. I said they all blamed dad instead of wondering why they had nobody willing to take my half sister when needed and none of them could. Others heard the whole thing.
