Eventually I got called in to talk to our state's division of child support and they said that if he didn't come in within 1 week they would put out an order for his arrest. In the US if you're on welfare they go after baby dad for support, you have no choice. Or at least that's how my state is. I spread the word he had 1 week to get tested or go to jail. Within 24 hours he called me up because \"he just found out he needed to DNA test, no one told him we were looking for him\". 97.7% DNA match. \n\nOne of his buddies knocked up a friend of mine 2 years later. And he pulled the same play as my kids dad. Denied having sex with her from a one night stand at a party. The only difference was she didn't go after him for support because she had a decent job. Her baby daddy sent me a message once asking me out a few years later. I said I don't date deadbeats who deny their children's existence. That whole group of men were/are disgusting.

So it's not a 100% the person who cheated's fault.  I seriosuly considered cheating at one point because I was getting no emotional needs met in a relationship.  And I thought I'd never ever cheat because it's wrong.  What stopped me from trying is 1. I actully wanted a relationship and I knew that someone who would cheat with me was likely not a good relationship partner 2. It would probably be unsatisfying and 3. I could get caught which would make things worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway more than you wanted to know, but just know at 17 that yes maybe your mom is terrible.
