You need to tell your husband that per the FDA ruling in 1999, \"over-the-counter drug products containing colloidal silver ingredients or silver salts for internal or external use are not generally recognized as safe and effective and are misbranded.\"  Under NO circumstances would I let my kids be sprayed with this stuff.  MIL cannot be trusted and should not be allowed to care for your baby.", "Oh hell no nta!\n\nShe did something to your child *behind your back* after you explicitly told her not to. ***Repeatedly***. She has zero respect. I wouldn't leave my child with someone like that alone either.", "NTA\n\nShe assaulted your child, plain and simple.  She needs to be thankful that you didn't have her arrested, not trying to go around your back to your husband to \"sort it out\" (which just screams Just NO MIL)\n\nFeel free to drop by the JustNoMIL subreddit, if you'd like.  They're a godsend for people like us with nightmare MILs.", "NTa\n\n\"I told you no, you waited until I left the room and did it anyway. That is not ok. You are no longer allowed to be in the same room with the baby without me until you prove you can be trusted. I also want an apology and an explanation on why you think its ok to do something to my child after I told you no. If your apology is not sincere you are no longer welcome to be around the baby at all. If I find out you complained to anyone about this, you are no longer allowed to be around the baby at all. Including arguing with me after I stop speaking right now. You will accept I am the one in charge of my child, not you, even if that's what it takes. \"", "NTA - What are the side effects of colloidal silver?\n\n>The silver in colloidal silver gets deposited into the skin and various organs. This can lead to a permanent bluish color that first appears in the gums. Areas of the skin exposed to the sun will become increasingly discolored. It can also damage organs.", "NTA\n\nYou have stated your boundary... now stick to it.  At least you have your husband on your side.  But you will have to hold fast.\n\nYour MIL will not like this.  She wants to do what she wants to and doesn't like to be told no.\n\nNever leave the kids with her alone ever again.", "NTA at all. One small mist of colloidal silver is one thing, but does she realize that the stuff can turn you permanently blue? It won't take too much, especially for a baby. She needs to keep her crazy woo woo remedies to herself.", "NTA: she needed to hear that, and you\u2019re making the right decision about your child going to nursery. Can you imagine what MIL would get up to while you\u2019re at work??\n\nI\u2019d like to add- your husband needs to reinforce that you\u2019re on the same side, and he can\u2019t \u201csort it out\u201d. These kinds of power struggles can last for years.", "NTA - You're the parent. If she can't respect that, she doesn't get to be there.", "nta\n\nbro that stuff is straight up DANGEROUS. like what u/Efficient-Jacket-386 said, the FDA warned that colloidal silver is not safe or effective in treating jack shit. also: \n\n>Colloidal silver can cause serious side effects. The most common is argyria, a bluish-gray discoloration of the skin, which is usually permanent.\n\nalso she has very little respect for u bc that is ur baby and if u dont want her spraying random (DANGEROUS) chemicals on your kid then she needs to respect that. \n\ni'd seriously reconsider leaving her alone with the baby from now on; not saying that she'll do something terrible w ur kid but she obvs does not care about your/your husbands boundaries.", "NTA\n\nNursery is best. MIL doesn\u2019t get to ignore your request. Especially when it comes to medical issues.", "Many people have already spoken what I want to say, but I will say it anyway. Colloidal silver can be dangerous and should not be sprayed on young children. Going behind your back is not okay. Tell her that if she tries it again, you will have her removed from the property and file a restraining order, on the grounds that she is using unsafe liquids on your child.", "Nta don\u2019t leave the baby alone with her", "Why in God's friggin name would she ever think THAT WAS THE SOLUTION for cleaning any person's eyes out, let alone a baby?\n\n\nAsking your husband to sort it out?  Yes please get your wife in line so I can use a homeopathic remedy I found on the internet to spray in your baby's eyes.\n\n\nEverything I read is that it isn't FDA approved and is often sold on the internet as a homeopathic remedy.  It says not to be used on children under 2 years old and the sprays for homeopathic remedies in spray form are for oral consumption or to put on skin, nothing about eyes.  There are specific eye drops for that, but regardless of which one she used, she had no right to just do it after you said no.  She isnt the parent.\n\n\nTo be honest, this isnt the first time she has used this or some other essential oil or homeopathic remedy her shaman told her about LOL.  She has been doing this a while, you just happened to be there and say no.\n\n\nShe will continue to undermine you and do things behind your back and until she takes accountability for this and apologizes, not to mention changing her behavior in any way, there would be no visits supervised or not between her and the kids.\n\n\nCONSEQUENCES FOR ACTIONS \n\n\nNTA....you need to get a spray bottle with water and spray her every time she pulls BS.\n\n\nGO TO JUSTNOMIL SUB", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"AITA for telling her she has no respect or boundaries and would no longer be looking after my baby when I go back to work? \" ..

She doesn\u2019t respect me or husband at all. Yet respects her other kids boundaries? It doesn\u2019t make sense. She has never been bothered about people knowing husband is her least favourite and yet used to make him do everything for her. He has put his foot down since we\u2019ve been together - he has realised a lot of her ways. But she got much better for around 2 years.
