L's 13th birthday is in March, and she has been so excited to finally be a teenager. We usually start planning a couple months before hand, so L can agree on something without changing her mind every second. Every year for L's birthday, we go to a hotel with a few of her friends. The hotel is always my birthday present, so she usually only gets a card from a friend. L has been looking at different hotels lately, and a certain one has caught her eye. The only problem is that it costs 100$ for a night. I can't afford that, after buying her brother a PS5 for Christmas. It has a huge pool and a waterslide, which is most likely why she wants to go. I told her it was too expensive, and instead offered to go to the same hotel we had gone to last year, which is way cheaper. It has a smaller pool, and a decent waterslide. L said no, claiming that she hated that hotel, that the water in the pool was \"dirty\" , the waterslide cut her leg open and she didn't want to swim in a cramped pool with \"sweaty 9 year old boys who will pee in the pool.\" I feel as if she is just being dramatic so she can go to a more expensive place to impress her friends. I told her no, we would be going to last years hotel and I thought that would be the end of it.\n\nBut, a couple days ago, she approached me and asked if she could bring along a little more people than we usually do (3 friends, L and I.) She wanted to bring 4 people instead, so one of her other friends could join as well and not be left out. I said no. L immediately started begging, saying its just one more and it wouldn't hurt. Eventually I snapped and told her that the party was cancelled, and to stop thinking about it. She started crying and telling me that I am a jerk, but I could care less.

She is excited and hoping for something awesome for a milestone in her life. You knew the birthday was coming up in March and chose to spend the money on a PS5 for your son instead of buying an Xbox or something cheaper that allows you to pay for your child to not cut her leg open on her birthday.

Which, if you're going by current prices, can start at about $350, depending on where you purchase it from. Wow. You're either a cheapskate that favors the boys over their sister or you just suck at saving money.

The way you word it makes it seem like its ONLY for him as well. Second, most hotels cost around 100$.. If I was her I would never want to go to something cheaper. After refusing to take your daughter somewhere nice for her 13th birthday (which imo is going to be a lifelong memory) you CANCEL when she asks for ONE more friend. 4 friends is not even a lot. Let your daughter enjoy time w her friends. Bet she won't be around as soon as she turns 18.", "YTA. I guess you don't think much of your daughter.

A $20 charm bracelet?\n\nSurely you can save 100$ between now and february for her birthday atleast", "YTA. What did you buy L for Christmas? I suspect it was a lot less than a PS5. \n\nAnd why does what you bought your son for Christmas come into this at all? It's three months until her birthday.

OP sends hundreds of dollars on a PS 5 for the son but can\u2019t muster up $100 for one night at a motel.

Oh and now since daughter is unappreciative the party at said crappy motel is cancelled.", "YTA. I feel sorry for your daughter. She clearly doesn't want to go to the same place as last year for valid reasons.  When she tries to make it a little more tolerable you cancel? Doesn't make sense.", "This can't be real. First off, almost every hotel is over $100 unless you are lucky to get a good deal from a third party vendor, or are at a roach motel.\n\n 2nd you have your daughter, one friend and yourself ,well that's fine but most teenage girls like to have a few friends along with.  What is the issue with her inviting an additional friend. You just say no with no explanation. Do you not like this particular friend.  You have to use some context. of why you're so adamant that this friend doesn't attend.\n\n I'm trying to figure out why you're so mean to your daughter.

The fact that you even need to ask boggles my mind. Go be a decent human being and pay 100.00 for your daughter to have a birthday party.

Just because that\u2019s what she\u2019s done in the past doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s going to want to do that forever; she\u2019s growing up, interest change.

She\u2019s 13 and you said it\u2019s a big deal.  How\u2019s it a big deal if you take her to the same smaller place as last year.  And no, you can\u2019t take one more friend I bought your brother a PS5 which begs the question, what did you buy the other kids? I see lots of fun for this kid in her teen years.", "YTA.

One child\u2019s gifts should not be a reason you can\u2019t afford a gift for another especially not for events that months apart. This reeks of favoritism.", "YTA. 1 more person is not a few.

I mean, PS5s are still going for $600, aren't they? That's a lot for one kid on one holiday. But please, keep displaying blatant favoritism.

You sound like way more of a child than she does. If you can't handle your emotions when she pushes back this little bit, you are not competent to parent teenagers. Go to therapy NOW before you do anymore damage.", "YTA. $100/night is not expensive. I truly wonder what crappy hotel you stay in that has a pool and cost less then $100/night. Give her the choice of the PS5 or hotel room and then it's up to her if she wants a party or PS5 more.", "YTA \n\nAll her concerns about the previous hotel is very valid. The slide cut her leg, and the water is dirty so that could have led to a very serious infection.  It sounds like the hotel doesn't change the water regularly or add the property chemicals. \n\n\nHer concern about her other friend feeling left out is also valid. I think it's sweet that she is taking her friend feelings into consideration. Since you are already going to the previous hotel because of cost why not let your daughter bring an extra friend as a compromise?\n\nCancelling her entire party is not teaching your daughter that life isn't fair. You're teaching her that YOU'RE not fair, that you will value the wants of her brother over hers and trust that will cause lasting resentment and damage to not only your relationship but the relationship between your daughter and your son.", "YTA, a big AH. \nWhy do you have to invalidate and hurt her feelings like that?? If you can\u2019t afford a $100 hotel, then you could have and should have offered her a compromise to find a place that costs in-between last year\u2019s hotel and her request. But IMO, if you spent too much on her brother\u2019s game console and this is the result, then that\u2019s on you.\nAnd so what if she wants to celebrate with one extra friend. I would bet that they\u2019re a close group and want to share this experience together.

I had to read the post twice to wrap my head around what she said. At first I was like ok, she can't spring for $100, some people can't do that, that's fair, but there's also a way to talk about that and come to an enjoyable solution. But then the PS5 talk... nope. Nope nope nope. She's being so unfair to her daughter. I honestly wish I could get my daughter to befriend her daughter so they could have a fun party together or something.", "I need to learn to do that", "Beautiful answer, chef's kiss", "The worst.", "Where is the little head banging against the wall emoji?", ">hopefully she dumps your ass in a retirement home\n\nThat's way more than OP deserves. I hope daughter just goes NC and OP can figure out what is going to happen to her in her old age by herself. I'm sure we all know what the \"lessons\" she is giving her son about how being irresponsable just gets your bigger and better things are going to lead to.", "I was the child who's mom did shit like this. She is currently fighting to spend any time with me at all. Trust me, even if you fix this this has already solidified in her mind as a really shit memory of you.\n\n\n-\nMeant to reply to OP's comment", "oh  i have few words that i would like to say  but alas reddit will ban me if say them"]}
