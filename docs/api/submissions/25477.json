(Besides the obvious anyway lol) I have a 17yr old son who deserves to have a stable family. I NEVER want him to experience what I've been through. I gave her 3 chances. My only ask from her was that she wasn't high when she saw him. \n\n1) Visited us in the hospital - high as fuck. Had a nurse remove her.\n\n2) Set up a visit in the park when my son was about 9 months (didn't want her to know where I lived). Almost 2 hours after she was supposed to show up, I'm packing up and getting ready to leave and hear her yelling \"Where are you going?!?! You're supposed to wait for me!\" As she gets closer I see that's she's high (surprise surprise) and she's still yelling at me, but I honestly have no clue what's spewing out of her. Told her I already waited long enough and I  just refuse to deal with her high, so I gathered whatever I hadn't and left.\n\n3) My son was turning 2 and my stepdad had asked if they could get him some presents. (Absolutely LOVE my stepdad, but he enables my birth giver) I told him that this is the last chance she has. I once again set up a meeting in a park. They were both there when I arrived and for about 5 minutes it was fine. Until she starts to nod off *while my son is on her lap*! Grabbed my son, left the presents, and told her that she will never know my son, because all she has proved is that drugs are more important.*\n\n\n\n*(Don't pile on me, telling me it's a \"disease\". I am aware. I am also aware of the fact that I'm almost 40, she had me at 18, and has been an addict since before I was even conceived. My grandparents had paid multiple times for rehab, she's gone months without using while in the rehab or jail and just goes right back. At this point, it becomes a choice. She had all the tools and support available, but just always took the easy way.

Those that do seek help do one of three things:\n\n1. Wake up and realize they are the problem. Usually appropriate meds and supplements are involved.\n\n\n2. Manipulate their therapist into giving them a script for whatever they want, get loaded on their meds, and lie to their therapist about what person they are.
