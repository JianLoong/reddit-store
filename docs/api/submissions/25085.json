I am a tradesman and she was in university and was not going to end up with a blue collar worker. I was just some fun. \n\nLawyers got involved. I signed away my parental rights, I pay child support, and most importantly for me I get visitation. \n\nWell I guess nature trumps nurture because my son is like me. He likes the stuff I like and he is a mini me. Not so mini any more he is 14 and an inch taller than me already. \n\nI was always told that if anything ever happened to my ex and her husband my son would go to her older sister. I was fine with this so long as I got to see my son on my set schedule if this ever happened. \n\nI live a pretty good life now. I just got married last year and we bought a new house. I have a spare room that my son stays in when he spends the night. \n\nLife is shitty so my ex and her husband just passed away in a car accident. Besides my son they had two other kids. Her sister also has three kids. So now it's six children in the house. \n\nHer sister contacted me about maybe taking my son. I was interested since I love him and want him in the best environment. I spoke with my wife and we agreed that would work. My wife is smarter than me so she said that we would want all the money that was for him transferred to us. Not to us personally or anything. Just so we could administer it. She said we didn't want to have to go asking for money every time he needed something or when it came time to pay for his post secondary education. \n\nNope. They wanted to keep control of his money. They said that they felt more comfortable being the trustees for his financial welfare. \n\nSo we said we understood and would continue to pay child support. And have visitation. I talked to my son about it while he was here with me. He said he would like to look be with me but that he also wants to stay with his siblings. I told him that he was always welcome in my home and that we would make the spare room 100% his if he was going to spend more time with us. \n\nMy ex's family have been hounding me to change my mind. They say that I'm his father and that I need to step up and that I can trust them to safeguard his money. \n\nMy wife and I could afford to take him in and don't really need the money. But we don't think it's for that we don't get his share of the insurance and estate. It is his and if he is with us we should be able to take care of it for him. We don't even care if it gets put into a trust for him.

What worries me is they will use his share to support everyone. So contact a lawyer. Have his money put in a trust. That away the trust takes care of his money. My guess is the money is already gone.

We have a trust set up for our son and the person who will receive custody of him is not the same person who will be the trustee. They will have to work with the trustee to agree upon reasonable disbursements for the care and maintenance of the child. Everything will have to be documented and there are annual filing requirements to ensure that everyone is acting in the best interest of the child. \n\nThis is standard practice for estate law to mitigate potential conflicts of interest. Your reason for not taking in your son is horribly flawed.", "NTA - You have no guarantee that they would not tamper with it drain sons fund, they literally pressured you until you signed away your rights. You pay child support and visitation. \n\nI would be a little concerned about your wife, she may just want his money but you personally don\u2019t.

Period. They\u2019ve never liked you but want your money. You have a proven track record of your success. They don\u2019t have the right to control you. They don\u2019t respect you.

You could get the money put in a third party administered trust, if they don\u2019t trust you.  Take him half the time and lose paying child support.  There\u2019s other options rather than all or nothing, and a good family attorney could help you figure it out.  Or a mediator - less expensive.", "YTA. As someone who is the trustee for a minors inheritance, I side eye this type of demand for control over it incredibly hard. There should be no reason for you to need access to his inheritance, outside of emergency situations. \n\nIf you're in the US and your son does come to live with you, you should be able to get ss for him.

Why's it matter?", "> My wife is smarter than me so she said that we would want all the money that was for him transferred to us. Not to us personally or anything. Just so we could administer it. \n\nESH. I\u2019m majorly suspicious of the motives in play here, including you, your wife and your ex\u2019s family. Sounds like a conflict of interest. And there should be no talk of \u201ccontrol\u201d with a trust. Set out reasonable terms for your son\u2019s benefit only. And follow it to the letter. \n\nAnd just because *you* might not want it for yourself, what about your wife? Can you swear you know her motives? What if you have kids with her in the future, one of them has a medical problem or need money for college tuition?\n\nCan you guarantee you won\u2019t spend your son\u2019s inheritance *from his mother* on a child that\u2019s not hers? Or if your wife\u2019s car breaks down and you have no money to replace it. Can you guarantee that money won\u2019t be touched? \n\n> She said we didn't want to have to go asking for money every time he needed something or when it came time to pay for his post secondary education.\n\nYou said you guys can afford his care. So why do you need to withdraw at all? That money shouldn\u2019t be touched until he\u2019s 18. \n\nIf I die, my childrens\u2019 part of the inheritance goes into a trust administered by a third party. My husband will get his own inheritance and a life insurance payout. The trust will only pay after they turn 18 and only to them.\n\nIf there is a medical emergency while they\u2019re minors the trust will pay for their care. Otherwise it can\u2019t be touched by anyone including my husband. If he needs money from it he will need to ask, with documentary evidence.\n\nA child\u2019s inheritance is *for the child*. It should not be used to pay for the child\u2019s care while they\u2019re minors. You\u2019re his father.

You can end up in situations where you sign away your legal parental rights and still owe child support depending on the custody agreement. \n\nFor example, my husband has some limited physical custody of his daughter but not legal parental rights and he pays child support. At the time that everything went down, he couldn\u2019t afford an attorney and his ex-wife\u2019s attorney threatened to ruin him financially if he didn\u2019t agree to those terms. He felt that he had no choice but to agree to the terms.\n\nEvery state in the US has different laws surrounding this issue. You do not need someone willing to adopt in order to terminate parental rights.", "I know people who pay more in child support so they will have no parental rights and don\u2019t have to see their kid. Sad, I know.", "Wholeheartedly agree.", "Yes, this part. Either this is a fake post or OP does not understand what he signed. If it\u2019s not a fake post it sounds like he agreed to give the mom sole legal custody, but if he actually signed away his paternal rights he wouldn\u2019t have visitation or custody. \nSource-me, who has a child whose father couldn\u2019t sign away his parental rights quickly enough once he learned it got him out of paying child support.", "Yeah, either OP is full of it or really ignorant. Losing custody or even signing away custody is not signing away rights. If it\u2019s true, OP is a screaming AH, though - you either love your kid or you don\u2019t, and control of the finances should not make you not want your kid with you.", "Exactly. He could take the kid in and fight this out later\u2026but nope. \nYTA", "Son also wants to stay with younger siblings which father has no relationship with at all.", "He said \u201csure I\u2019ll take my own kid but only if I get all the money\u201d. To me that smells to high heaven a lot more than them not wanting to overturn mom\u2019s will.", "aren't you the father? Odd way to talk about yourself", "You can surely arrange visitation, or you can invite the sibs and cousins on a few occasions, just as you would if he had school friends.\n\nObviously the family was sh*tty way back when, but this is the new generation, and it's all of y'alls fault that this is so complicated, not the kids'.\n\nIt boggles the mind that we force kids to sit 30 in a class and \"be friends\" and demonstrate more tolerance and conflict-resolution skills than their own friggin parents and families, who are adults.", "Yet, the child\u2019s extended family doesn\u2019t want to be responsible for his life, just his trust money."]}
