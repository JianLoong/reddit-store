I cant imagine being so insecure that you think your wife paying for food makes you less of a man. Good lord", "NTA - he needs to make up his mind. Does he want you to pay or not?", "NTA- I would reply back \"that the only take that makes you less than a man is this conversation\".", "NTA\n\nHe doesn't get to complain about him paying everything and at the same time feel embarrassed if you do pay on your own, just because you are in front of others. Its ridiculous.", "NTA but why haven't you reminded him that he comes from a family who has men pay, he paid and complained and when you started paying he didn't have an issue until someone else saw. \n\nHe needs an ego check.", "NTA.  Your husband isn't less of a man because he let you pay, he's less of a person for finding shame in such things.", "NTA. Your husband brought this upon himself. He made an issue out of what he thought was 'inequitable', so you happily rectified his issue. Which it sounds like he was fine with until his family found out and called him on it and now he's blaming you. He's the AH here. I think the bigger problem you need to address here is how he constantly throws stuff in your face about him paying for things. It's petty and immature. As a couple, if you can't agree on something as simple as dinner, then it's not going to get easier when a house and bills and kids are involved. Your hub needs to take a hard look at his attitude.", "NTA\n\nHe can\u2019t insist that he be the one to pay for everything to preserve his \u201cmanliness\u201d but also try to use that he pays for everything as ammo against you in a fight. He\u2019s either ok with you paying for yourself, which would include doing so around other people and dealing with any other (idiotic) gossip that could arise as a result. Or he\u2019s not. \n\nYou called him on his bull and now he\u2019s having to deal with the consequences of his own hypocrisy. I like it.", "NTA\n\nAnd you shouldn't have to compensate or explain yourself due to your husband and his family's insecurities about what a man is. They're the ones who need to explain their archaic thinking.", "NTA - As someone who was in a relationship with someone who refused to let me pay for things and then the minute we fought threw it back in my face, I applaud you for paying for your own things.\n\nIf he wants to pay for your things, that's his choice but he has no right to bring it up or use it against you afterwards. It has nothing to do with misogyny or him being or not being a typical \"man\". It has everything to do with how he complains and makes you feel bad when he chose to pay for things.", "NTA, your husband is afraid to stand up to the people who are actually making him uncomfortable and his spineless ass is taking it out on you. Gotta put your foot down and let him know that he needs to hash it out with his shitty family and not take his frustrations out on you.", "NTA.\n\nYou paid for your own food and opposed their misogynistic views \u2014 good job!\n\nYour husband should be proud and supportive.", "Yeah, if you had done it for the first time in front of his brother to embarrass him in front of his family, then that would be a little messed up.\n\nBut it sounds like this is a normal thing you've been doing for a while and it is based on him using the fact that he paid in the past, which was inappropriate.\n\nSo NTA. His family needs to readjust their views on masculinity and he needs to think about *why* he wants to pay for you. It should be love, not control.", "NTA- both guys were raised in a \u201cmen should always pay\u201d type of household, that\u2019s not your fault. you couldn\u2019t have predicted him teasing your husband. i don\u2019t see it as being petty, he decided to let you do your thing. if he *really* wanted to then he could have paid.", "NTA, especially if he makes it a point to bring up that he pays for everything. On a side note, it always baffles me that other married couples don't conjoin finances. I know its really common, but It seems so strange to me to bring upthat I bought my wife something or vice versa. I always thought the whole marriage thing was , \"whats yours is mine.\"", "Easiest NTA of my life", "NTA - HE caused this issue, not you. He wants the credit of 'paying for his woman' and 'seeming like a man' but in reality he treats you poorly and gets mad that he pays.\n\nHe needs to pick a side and stick with it! He cant have it both ways. Either he pays and shuts up with his resentment towards paying... or you pay your own way and make it known, when asked, that due to his resentment, you now pay for yourself.\n\nHe doesn't get to pretend you are the bad guy to his family when it is HIM choosing not to follow the way his family works.", "NTA. Throw the whole man away", "Yeah, NTA.\nHe, however, is totally the AH.\nHe insists on paying then complains about it: AH.\nWhen you pay he gets mad: AH.\n\nHe's put you in a situation where whatever you do he's mad: total controlling AH.\n\nAsk him what would make him STFU. Nothing seems to appease his misogynistic ways.", "NTA. His and his brother's misogynistic attitudes are not your problem.", "NTA. Family is fulla misogynistic clowns tho", "NTA. However, in the restaurant situation, I can see how it would look weird since you are married, it is not like you are buying some clothes for yourself for example. You could have transferred the money to him, if it is that important to you, and should maybe make a agreement to do that next time. Have you got a joint account to pay bills? Could you had a bit for day out together maybe. As for being less than a man, no it doesn't, it means that as a husband, he is respecting his wife choice to feel independent. Going against the flow of opinions take more strength and courage than just following the mob.", "NTA.", "ESH - You two are married... maybe your husband makes a big deal of getting the check at dinner, but you were already paying. Your husband and his bros suck for acting like you somehow aren't contributing.\n\nWhere you messed up was paying for just yourself, that was childish and petty. What you should have done was shown these guys who really has the biggest dick and paid for the entire meal.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sounds like your husband has a big ego and a fragile sense of masculinity. It's pretty garbage to insist that you pay for someone and then throw that back in their face, but you aren't the asshole for not playing his game", "NTA- I would just say- I'm done having you give me shit about it. You have expressed that you don't want to, I'm taking you at your word.\n\nAlso- why are you with this man?  He is driven by ego, and he's also petty and controlling.", "NTA.  It\u2019s okay for him to pay out of kindness, but it\u2019s not okay if he pays and then turns it into some kind of bargaining chip.  His family\u2019s sexist attitude is not your problem.", "NTA. Your husband is the one who complained about paying for you. He doesn't also get to keep his image about always paying for you (as a manly man - /s) to his family.", "INFO: I'm confused by your arrangement. You're married. Do you not shared bank accounts? Do you just literally mean he hands the CC over and it then is paid from a joint account?", "NTA. Tell him he can\u2019t have it both ways. He can\u2019t pay for your stuff then complain about it. If you pay for your things he can\u2019t complain about you doing it. It\u2019s old fashioned how his family think but you two should sit down and talk about this.", "NTA!!! he doesn\u2019t get to complain and get mad at you that he pays for everything, then complain when you pay for things yourself. What he wants is for you to pay for all your shit but put on a front for other people that he still does it so he can look like a big man in public. If he wants to be seen as a big man, then he needs to act like it and  stop bitching about paying for things when that\u2019s the reputation he wants OR he can let you pay and stop bitching when it affects his reputation.  Either way he needs to pick a side and stop bitching. What he wants is not only unreasonable and unfair to you, but is never going to happen if you have any self respect. I\u2019d make that clear to him so he can make an informed decision moving forward.", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t get to lord over you how he pays for your stuff and then get mad you pay for your own stuff.", "INFO. Does he ever throw it in your face that he pays for your things?\n\nIf no, then NAH, you married your husband knowing the culture he comes from however and I think for your sake you should allow him to pay for more things as it is a big part of his social standing and self esteem and feelings of adecuacy.\n\nIf yes, then NTA and politely remind him of how you don't want him to throw it in your face again, and that you need to have a discussion of how to balance it without creating resentment on either side.", "Info:  I'm more curious about your response on him saying he feels \"less like a man\"", "TBF it's because that's not how you were raised.  I'm sure if you were told from the age of 5 you're not a man unless you support your wife you'll believe it.  It's not excusing his behavior but it's learned", "I see stuff like this and wonder how other people must view my parents. They spend their own money on \"nonessentials\" and sleep in separate rooms because they are *not* sleep compatible (my dad is a violent sleeper and snores like a goddamn train). Can't believe my dad is so unmanly smh", "Or how about. \n\n\"I'm sorry, that's the way your family raised you, but just know I married you because I love who you are. Not what you can buy for me.  That is what makes you a man:  \n\nThis is her partner", "This. He can\u2019t have it both ways. He tried both ways and each time put the blame on you when it was him both times. Is this really how you want to live?", "This. He is way too concerned about what his siblings and parents think of him and way too little concerned about what you think of him. Sorry but your marriage needs counseling if you want to continue together.", "No don\u2019t ask because we already know he wants her to pay for everything but put on a show in public the he does it asking him would just give him the assumption that that\u2019s a option and if op has self respect it\u2019s not she needs to ask him if he what he wants is to pay (and not take it out on OP because it\u2019s HIS CHOICE to do so) or he wants her to pay and if willing to deal with the possible social repercussions of doing so around his family there\u2019s no in between", "Had me in the first half.", "I think the whole throwing in your face is part of \"feeling like a man\" in cases like this. The whole idea is to leverage money to \"win\" the relationship. Too bad op has her own money", ">It involved him bringing up how he pays for most of my stuff.\n\nLiterally the third paragraph", "And it can be learned away, too. Otherwise our habits and values would match the habits and values of stone age people. This questioning of habits and values and deciding to change the bad ones happens when kids grow up to be adults, they start thinking on their own. Not sure if OP's husband ever did that.", "Of course, I was just responding to the person saying I could imagine, and I what I typed popped in my head. \n\nI know these behaviors are bad and there are some people who adapt them naturally and others who were raised to believe that. \n\nImo since OP husband is the latter it may be beneficial for her to actually discuss it with him.  Show him how he can still be a great man without think he has to prove it through money"]}
