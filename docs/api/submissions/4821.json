Not because of hurt feelings.\n\nThe husband was fine with the change until his family hurt his feelings, and suddenly it's OP's fault?", "OP does mention that she did it out of habit and not maliciously. And while saying he\u2019ll try from time to time, she doesn\u2019t mention him trying to pay this time. So\u2026 who knows? Again, I do agree apologies should happen, but I also don\u2019t think she should apologize for his siblings\u2019 behavior.", "I disagree with your assessment. Letting someone do something for you isn't you doing them a \"favor\". She said herself that she wasn't bothered by it prior to the fight, which she says was the impetus to change her behaviour.\n\nThere are clearly hurt feelings for both of them, which she admits to in the post. If they talk over and resolve their feelings as well as the inciting incidents, they can choose to go back to how it was, or keep going with the way they've changed for themselves. \n\nHow you relate together in a relationship isn't a toy, and I'd object to your framing. It seems less like you want her to come to the table on the issue(s) that she's clearly also bothered over, and more like you just want him to never pay again because you fear him having some kind of power over her.", "I must have missed that. Thank you for pointing that out.\n\nI wouldn't call her apology an apology for the siblings' behaviour in that situation. She can't apologize for her husband being clowned on, so to speak, but she can apologize for giving someone something to clown on you *for*.\n\nIf hypothetically speaking, my wife had a tradition where the women drove, and I drive to the family dinner because we were running late & I was the better driver when stressed, I didn't tease her, but my actions created a preventable and avoidable situation she could be teased for. I believe I should apologize for that. Either way, thanks for talking with me about it.", "NTA but maybe a litte jerkish.  Granted, Louis has it coming for being so rude about his own generosity, that's just snotty and self-serving.  I think the \"who pays\" thing goes back and forth.  He pays until he starts complaining and then OP pays for a while.  OP does not explain WHY this was an occasion where she would pay for herself and I suspect it was just to provoke this exact situation.  \"If his own family realizes how he's treating me, it will derail his whole M.O.\" Sort of a malicious compliance thing.  Louis' manners are in the dustbin and I hope this will convince him to explore how things got that way and repair his ways.", "NTA. The whole thing makes him a giant baby not a man", "NTA\n\nI think that you guys should have a conversation on what he's comfortable covering for you and what you cover for yourself. Because clearly he can't just do one, but he can't have it both ways. He wants to be seen as a provider to his family but doesn't actually want to do that fully. Which is completely fine, albeit a little annoying and superficial, in my opinion. But as a couple, you guys should be able to find a middle ground where he feels he is providing for you but not to the point that it makes him feel 'used' (idk if this is the right word). Because if he's willingly paying for you, then he's in no place to be upset with you for it.", "Your husband sounds miserable", "NTA\n\nCan't have it both ways.", "NTA.  Your husband can't have it both ways, and surely, he needs to understand that you are done dealing with it being thrown back in your face.  He needs his family to be picking on him, at this point he deserves it.  Ask him if he wants to explain to Michael why you are paying your way, or would he rather just endure the current and potentially more mild joking shots?", "NTA. He can\u2019t have it both ways.", "*But I don\u2019t want to have it thrown in my face that he pays for my things so since then I\u2019ve payed for my own stuff just fine.*\r  \n\r  \nIf that's what your husband was doing you have maybe deeper problems than this particular conflict, but you're still NTA here or there.", "ESH.  Would it really be a big deal if you let him pay at restaurants, especially if his family is around, and you pay for your other stuff like clothing etc.?  To tell you the truth, my friend F58 and her husband usually pay for their own meals when they go out and a lot of people think it is weird, but we are all boomers, so I we may have a different perspective.\n\nBut seriously, marriage is about compromise, and I think this could make everyone happy.  Just give a little.\n\nETA.  I should add that I totally understand why my friend and her husband do this.  When she met him, his finances were a mess, and she, an accountant, got him to financial security.", "Well said."]}
