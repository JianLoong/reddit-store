When we are with my brother in law, my wife always pays because he doesn\u2019t believe in women paying so naturally she always does. It\u2019s quite fun. \n\nDifferent things work for different couples.", "Or take the third option: sharing expenses.", "But he didn\u2019t pay, she did.

But I don\u2019t understand how or why you find it difficult to accept free stuff and save/donate your saved funds. Your husband has asked to pay for you so just accept it and move on. If anyone tries to throw it in your face simply correct them and tell them you do it to please your husband not because you\u2019re a gold digger.

Did you ask for separate checks or do the calculator thing like a table full of old ladies in Miami at 5 in the afternoon.?\nIn any case, you purposely embarrassed your husband. Very petty.  Not at all cool.  If you had just picked up the whole check, that would have looked better.", "NTA. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. Let him pay like he insists and he'll lord it over you. Pay for your own stuff and he'll complain that it makes him look bad.  \n\nI certainly see him as \"less of a man\" because of how ridiculous he is.", "NTA Dude can't have it both ways. Either he pays and is gracious about it, or you pay for yourself if he's going to throw it in your face at every opportunity.", "So he needs someone to pretend to need things from him to feel \"like a man?\" That's how you make a toddler feel like a big kid.

What a weird family culture to emphasize so heavily- that is *not* normal. But it\u2019s also a problem that you and your husband haven\u2019t reached a solution together. Going out to eat and asking for separate bills for the rest of your life is childish nonsense. \n\nWhy aren\u2019t your finances combined? You\u2019re married.

I understand why it works for some couples, but I am pretty firmly in the \" we are a unit\" camp.  I would be annoyed if my spouse paid for just himself, and I would never pay for just myself.\n\nSo it would be one thing if you and your husband had joint finances, and he was upset that you are giving the impression that you both maintain separate finances.  But that is not what is happening.  He is upset because of how this reflected on his masculinity.  When he had the nerve to use that \"masculinity\" against you in a fight prior!  The actual nerve!!\n\nThat being said, I do wonder how you have made it all the way to marriage without having more defined expectations about your financial behaviors as a couple, or how a gross complaint about his threatened masculinity is new to you.  It seems like \"me man, you lowly woman\" is and always has been who your husband is.", "Personally, the way this reads, you and your whole family are AH. Your husband is the AH for bringing up paying for most of 'your stuff'. If he has a problem with paying for crap, that is a different conversation. Not dropping it in the middle of an argument. Question I have though, how much of 'your stuff' was be buying? Are you a frequent flyer on Amazon, Macy's, or whatever...?\n\nYou paying for 'your stuff', get down with your bad self... Well done. You making it a point to pay for your meals when out together makes you a petty AH just to prove your point. As far as brother marking a comment to his siblings, I question what went down during the check phase of the meal. Did husband have check in hand and was ready to pay when you made it a point to pay your share? Were words exchanged?\n\nThat said, if there are petty issues with you and husband, instead of going Dutch at every meal, why the hell don't you pay every other time? You ask him out on 'date night' and you pay. He asks you out for date night and he pays. How did it get to this petty you pay/I pay shit in the relationship?

Sorry that's not having a belief, that's just hypocrisy and spinelessness.", "Also, the fact he doesn't want to look bad in front of his family of origin because he doesn't follow the spousal dynamic of his family of origin. He's more concerned about their opinion of him than his wife's opinion of the hypocrisy he flings in all directions. Not only does he treat her badly but he wants her to help him hide his bad treatment from the opinions that matter more to him than hers.", "Does hubby want to continue the relationship or is she merely a convenience, something he has to prove he's an adult and a man. He clearly resents \"having\" to pay for her yet am not offended that she doesn't allow him to keep up the illusion with his family because he is also spineless.\n\nWhy is it always on women to fix relationships and men who can't find out how to function as an adult in a relationship. I am begging cis het women to get some standards and realize being single is not the end of the world. Cis het men really need to start learning to fix themselves and take the first step to fix their relationships and not rely on women to do it and everyone else need to stop enabling them.", "edit: I should not be on Reddit @ 2 am because I become illiterate.
