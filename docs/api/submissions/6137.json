I think if you were black and someone did this,   people would probably not be expecting you to check your temper, at least not in this day and age.  I also live in a pretty progressive area of the country,  so this sounds even more shocking than it might if it happened elsewhere.  Like someone else here said, DO NOT APOLOGIZE.  You can tell her that your language was too strong, maybe, but don't apologize for getting angry."]}
