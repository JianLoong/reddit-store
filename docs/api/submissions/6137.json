There's no such thing as 'transracial'.    I wish you'd skipped the misogynist slur, but I understand why you were pissed off.", "Ok, I'm getting mixed reactions on this, but it seems to be that both K and I are Assholes. I will take this and attempt to apologise to my therapy group, thank you for your replies", "NTA. As a transgender person I would also have probably yelled at her for similar reasons, as she\u2019s blatantly appropriating both the experience of being Asian and the experience of being transgender.", "Straight up, you need to find a different therapist. Any therapist allowing \"transracial\" bullshit to take up space in therapy is bad. Your therapist is exposing you to discrimination and trauma. Please, for your sake, find a new therapist.", "NTA. I don\u2019t believe in \u201ctransracial\u201d either. I\u2019m with you and I\u2019d also be offended", "NTA but this reminds me too much of Ollie London. I hope K isn\u2019t hoping to look more Japanese and aiming to get plastic surgery.", "NTA people who call themselves tranracial are actively harming the communities they try to claim and you have every right to be upset and go off on her. I\u2019m not sure why many are calling you an asshole for rightfully being angry at someone being openly racist. I would have lost it too. The fact that the therapist kicked you out and stood up for her was weird and I would consider finding a therapist that is more aligned with you and can understand you better. This seems like a dangerous situation imo.", "ESH. Do I think K is bad and should not be sayinh \"I identify as Japanese\"? Yes. Do I think you were an asshole? yes.\n\nYou called her names and said horrible things to her. You say you don't remember what you said, but that you verbally abused and berated her. In group therapy. \n\nYou did make a mistake. You made group therapy a place that is not secure for other people, and let your issues get the best of you.", "NTA, it\u2019s amazing that she is allowed to pull some racist nonsense and not get asked to leave for upsetting you, but you getting angry is an immediate boot. Allowing racism (white person claiming/appropriating Asian culture) into a group but not allowing anger against it makes it a toxic environment for you and other asian people. Why is anger considered worse than racism? NTA, NTA.", "You\u2019re both the asshole. She should not be cosplaying someone\u2019s ethnic identity for fun. You were way out of line in the way you handled it.", "> I had found out that K was going around telling people that she was \"transracial\" and that she identified as Japanese\n\nIf I see a person who is not Asian referring to themself as Asian I just laugh.

Is K in fact of Japanese heritage? Do you have any factual knowledge of her ethnic or cultural background one way or another?\n2.

What sort of stuff don\u2019t you believe in?", "Info: is it possible she was referring to the other meaning of transracial? As in being adopted by parents of a different race than your own? I have heard the word used in that way before. \n\nRegardless, you really should not be blowing up at people like that in a mental health setting its not appropriate. I dont think yelling is appropriate in any public setting. I understand feeling angry and im not saying to not say anything, I just dont think its a good or helpful way to react. However I will cop to losing my temper in therapy before, so this isnt a judgement as much as it is advice. Also if she is a dolezal type, when you attend mental health stuff sometimes youre going to meet people with some wild beliefs. Its not helpful to yourself, them, or the professionals to start screaming at each other.", "You did WONDERFULLY right by calling her out.\n\nYOU SUCKED in the way you did so.\n\nEsh", "Soft YTA - in that obviously she is completely in the wrong, and I can see why that would be infuriating. \n\nBut part of the value in therapy is to learn how to deal with people who annoy us (for both valid & invalid reasons) in a way that doesn\u2019t make us the AH too. \n\nIt\u2019s a useful skill to learn - with a few steps:\n\n- person acts in a way that annoys me\n\n- I process my feelings & reactions that come up in response to their actions\n\n  - and filter out which are because you\u2019re being \u201ctriggered\u201d by something internal to you / your history, and which parts of your reaction are valid & worth mentioning to the other person\n\n- how to communicate your issues to that person in a way that has good outcomes\n\n  - where you don\u2019t end up worrying if you were the AH\n\n  - where people watching the interaction don\u2019t decide you were the AH\n\n  - where the other person has maximum chance to be open to your words, and reflect on them, and maybe make a positive change\n\nThis is a skill that everyone could get better at. Even after many years of therapy & self-awareness & practice, it\u2019s still possible to get it wrong on occasion. \n\nBut the more we learn, and the more we practice, the more natural it becomes & the better / easier / more positive our lives become. \n\nWell done you on joining the group therapy in the first place, and for being open to the feedback you\u2019re getting here. It\u2019s hard work at times to improve ourselves as people, but it\u2019s definitely worth it.", "YTA. ~~Unless K is white and pulled a Dolezal, you can\u2019t go around denying people of their identities~~The fact that your therapist kicked you out tells me everything I need to know about how terribly you behaved. Needless to say, go to therapy.\nETA: I just learned what transracial is. Thank you for educating me. While K is completely wrong by pulling a Dolezal, it was a perfect opportunity for OP to address it in therapy, instead of attacking her like that.", "YTA but only slightly\n\nYou can disagree with how a person feels but that doesn't mean you should scream at them. You can disagree with them saying they are transracial and a lot of people would probably agree with you. But that doesn't mean you should yell at them. \n\nWe're all just trying to survive on this floating little piece of rock, unless someone is hurting you or someone you love there isn't really a need to put them down. \n\nYou yourself said you think you made a mistake, how would you feel if someone just screamed at you for a minor thing you did.", "YTA dude, I don\u2019t care if she said she identified as a samurai, your reaction was unhinged, and doesn\u2019t belong in a public setting, let alone one revolving around trying to improve mental health. \n\nLet other people believe what they want to believe, it literally doesn\u2019t affect you at all unless you let it. You should prioritize your own improvements in therapy before trying to bring someone else down.", "YTA.\n\nYou acknowledge your own quick temper and also recognise that therapy is supposed to be a safe place for everyone.\n\nYou are not harmed by anything K says. \n\nYou don't seem to know K's background or why she feels/speaks as she does.\n\nYou are not a therapist. It is not your place to judge others.\n\nYou made a mistake. You need to apologise. To K and the rest of the group.\n\nBe better.", "Yta Why does it enrage you that she wants to be transracial? Whatever your answer is is what you should have said instead of shouting and calling her names. \nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s wrong to be offended but you aren\u2019t going to get your point across that way.", "YTA. Yeah, you were totally out of line.", "Yes you are", "YTA.  Wow, you were completely out of line.  What she says to someone else has no affect on you. She could identify as a rock and that is her business.  You were completely out of line to even comment, let alone yell at her.
