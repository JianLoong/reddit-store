They have, for the every single one of the past dinners, been taking the opportunity to go and have \u201cdate night\u201d and been using me as their own personal babysitter without asking. The rest of his family neglects to watch the kids so I\u2019m stuck watching not only my own children (who are all below the age of five) but also my husbands nieces and nephews, who are all also below the age of five. All together there are six children below the age of five under my care alone because absolutely no one else will take the time to watch them.  \n\nThis most recent dinner, *all* of the other kids were sick. We were given a heads up and my husband asked his sibling to not drop the kids off. Dinner starts and all of the sick kids walk in through the door with my husbands mom and dad. And, once again, the kids parents decided to stay home and have date night. Now myself and our own kids are sick and they missed out on Halloween due to their sickness. In a fit of fever-induced irritation, I sent his nieces and nephews parents a text letting them know that they\u2019re not allowed to bring the kids over while they\u2019re sick, and that the kids aren\u2019t allowed to come over for the dinners unless the parents are also there with them to watch over their own kids.

I have my own kids to watch and am not up for watching over yours, too. Also, do not bring your kids over if they\u2019re sick.

Your  BIL and SIL have been taking advantage of you.  They can hire a baby sitter.  And  don't get me started on the sick kids thing.  I missed out on enjoying 10 days of Christmas vacation because my sister dropped her sick kid off with my mom when I was visiting and I got sick as a  dog\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your request is MORE than reasonable and they are being huge AHs in how they've behaved thus far. But you should have a lesser gripe with your husband for enabling this and for your MIL/FIL for bringing kids with them to your place without your permission. MANY people are ok with taking you for granted here and that's a big issue. I'm glad you've taken this first step to tell the parents.", "NTA but I think your husband needs to be doing a lot more of the communicating with his family, and also watching the children. Where is he in all of this?", "Holy NTA.\n\nYou've been so gracious towards them up till now. \n\n>\"Now all the **adults** in the situation are pissed.\"\n\nAnd in return, they're pissed?? What adults?? You mean the siblings who chuck their kids at you as free daycare and knowingly get your kids sick and then throw a tantrum when you refuse to be used by them?\n\nThey aren't adults, they're entitled brats.\n\nGood on you for putting your foot down in a respectable way.", "NTA. You should have stood up for yourself way before.\n\n>The rest of his family neglects to watch the kids so I\u2019m stuck watching not only my own children (who are all below the age of five) but also my husbands nieces and nephews, who are all also below the age of five.\n\nSo I said no.  Husband, come watch neice and nephew.  Mother in law, your grandson needs you in here.  Mother in Law, please don't leave your grandkids unattended.\n\n>Dinner starts and all of the sick kids walk in through the door with my husbands mom and dad. \n\nSo I said no, we can't afford to get sick.  Dinner will have to wait until next month.  I'm really not sure why you thought it was appropriate to bring them.\n\n>Now all the adults in the situation are pissed.\n\nSo I said no.  I'm not dealing with this anymore. Hubby if you want this, you need to tell them to deal with it.  The next time the niece and nephew come over without their parents or the next time you leave me to deal with all the childcare, I will turn around and leave.  I will treat myself to a nice meal and we can talk about it when I get back after they've left.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s supposed to be a family dinner, not babysitting. Your request was more than reasonable.", "NTA.\n\nIf the pissed adults are that upset at setting a reasonable common sense boundary, someone else can host \u201cfamily\u201d dinner and step up to babysit.", "NTA\n\nThey sound like spoiled brats, WTAF?!?!  Who sees a family dinner as a chance to ditch the babies and go on date night.  That is ridiculous, and to send them sick???  No way!!", "Stop the dinners. \n\nIf DH wants a family dinner, he can meet them at a restaurant. Without you and your kids. And make sure he knows that your budget does not allow him to be a big shot and buy everyone else's dinners.", "NTA. They are taking advantage of you.  I would also be upset at husband and his family for forcing you to babysit his other siblings kids.  Going forward if more people are not supervising there kids remove yourself from the party by not feeling well and let your husband deal with it.", "NTA and boy is that a bold move. To use a family dinner at a relative's house as free babysitting so you can go out and do whatever. That takes some nerve. Stick to your guns. Do not let those kids come alone.", "NTA did they reply?", "Nta but personally I'd have loaded them up and dropped them back off *that night*.", "Absolutely NTA! And you put up with that nonsense way longer than I would have. The audacity and entitlement of your BIL and SIL is astounding! If they want/need a babysitter, they can hire one! They sound like lousy parents! What kind of parents pawn their sick kids off on other people??? For a \"date night\"??? The only assholes here are them!", "NTA. Your  request was very reasonable. SIL and BIL are in the wrong for using you as a babysitter without clearing it with you and for letting sick kids go over to your house.", "Stop hosting these dinners. Like straight up stop. Take your kids and go to McDonald\u2019s or something if your husband refuses. He can babysit instead.", "NTA. You *are* in the right. I suppose an argument can be made that your text could have been more diplomatic and whatever, but honestly, people with such poor boundaries usually need to be told things bluntly, so they sink in. Yes, of course they are pissed, because there go their \"date nights,\" but as long as you can handle rude people being angry at you for putting your foot down, you are in good shape.", "NTA.  It is time to put a stop to the dinners. Tell husband until he respect your boundaries and tell his family to cut the crap out there won\u2019t be anymore family dinners and if he chooses to do it anyway that you won\u2019t be there.  \n\nIf continues the dinners without gettyhis family in line then go out with a girlfriend or go get a massage but do not stay there and watch their kids.  Don\u2019t take your kids either so someone else has to take care of all 6 kids.", "NTA.  You're being used.  Time to cut that in the bud.", "NTA.\n\nyou are 100% correct.", "NTA - why didn\u2019t you put a stop to this the very first time?", "NTA", "NTA, your text was perfect.", "NTA and I cannot believe the audacity of your BIL & SIL getting invited to family dinners and then using them to dump their kids off while they take off for a date night. That is so damn RUDE! I would have put a stop to it after the first or maybe second time. If you don't come then your kids don't come.", "NTA but the next time this happens\u2026 and there will be a next time\u2026 walk out the door.  Say something like \u201cI said I wasn\u2019t going to be a babysitter.  I\u2019m just going to go do my own thing tonight and maybe we\u2019ll try this on another night.\u201d.  \n\nOnce your husband / IL\u2019s get stuck with the kids maybe they will start to understand.  That said, the initial blowback on you will be BIG just don\u2019t back down.", "NTA,and I hope you all get better very soon. But, why isn't your husband also on child duty?

It's the crazy lady jumping up and down and running side to side. Not the one sitting in the corner quietly not giving a fuck.\n\nAt some point in her youth, Crazy Woman gave the boat a little nudge. And look how everyone jumped to steady the boat! So she does it again and again and again. Soon her family is in the habit of swaying to counteract the crazy. She moves left, they move right, balance is restored (temporarily). Life goes on. People move on to boats of their own.\n\nThe boat-rocker can't survive in a boat by herself. She's never had to face the consequences of her rocking. She'll tip over. So she finds an enabler: someone so proud of his boat-steadying skills that he secretly (or not so secretly) lives for the rocking.\n\nThe boat-rocker escalates. The boat-steadier can't manage alone, but can't let the boat tip. After all, he's the best boat-steadier ever, and that can't be true if his boat capsizes, so therefore his boat can't capsize. How can they fix the situation?\n\nBallast!\n\nAnd the next generation of boat-steadiers is born. \n\nA born boat-steadier doesn't know what solid ground feels like. He's so used to the constant swaying that anything else feels wrong and he'll fall over. There's a good chance the boat-rocker never taught him how to swim, either. He'll jump at the slightest twitch like his life depends on it, because it did.\n\nWhen you're in their boat, you're expected to help steady it. When you decline, the other boat-steadiers get resentful. Look at you, just sitting there while they do all the work! They don't see that you aren't the one making the boat rock. They might not even see the life rafts available for them to get out. All they know is that the boat can't be allowed to tip, and you're not helping.\n\nNow you and your SO get a boat of your own. With your SO not there, the balance of the boat changes. The remaining boat-steadiers have to work even harder. \n\nWhile a rocking boat is most concerning to those inside, it does cause ripples. The nearby boats start to worry. They're getting splashed! Somebody do something!\n\nSo the flying monkeys are dispatched. Can't you and SO see how much better it is for everyone (else) if you just get back on the boat and keep it steady? It would make their lives so much easier.\n\nYou know what would be easier?
