Growing up, they had an imaginary friend, Mr. Blueface, who was some sort of benevolent monster. That in itself is kinda sweet, if it wasn't for the fact that they still hang out with Mr. Blueface!\n\nFor example, one time the three of us were hanging out, and we ordered pizza. \"Mr. Blueface just ordered a pepperoni pizza like always,\" Luis said. Another time we had a movie night, and when I picked Scream 2 Miguel said to Luis \"that's Mr. Blueface's favourite movie!\" and Luis said \"he'll be so happy to watch it tonight\" as if that monster were with us that very moment. They do this a lot, \"Mr. Blueface loves this,\" or \"Mr. Blueface said this.\"\n\n\"Do you know how weird you're sounding?\" I said, and they answered that they know, but \"come on, let us have our fun, this is how we always talk to another.\" They weren't exaggerating. One time I heard Miguel talking to Luis on the phone, and he was using their husky Mr. Blueface-voice for probably 50% of the conversation!\n\nI will have to add that they don't talk about Mr. Blueface all the time when we hang out, but there's these comments sprinkled in between, and they look at one another and chuckle. It feels weird and childish.\n\nOne of my friends just laughed and said that obviously Miguel and Mr. Blueface are a package deal, and it seems that I have to accept Mr. Blueface if I accept Miguel. My sister agreed with me and said that it sounds tiring as hell. She thought I should put my foot down and demand that Miguel and Luis acted like adults, but I dunno, a part of me feel like I will have to deal with it since old habits die hard.\n\nWell.

I have several childhood friends I still talk to, and sometimes silly things from our childhood just bleed into our everyday adult lives.

Yes we all have to do our adulting duties, but why do we have to be \"grown ups\" and give up fun things just because someone deems them childish?\n\nI \"grew up\" hard in my late teens and 20s.

It's a little weird, but it's a little inside joke between the two of them.  They don't do it constantly.  If that makes them happy I don't think it is anything to get upset about.  I'd say YTA if you ask them to stop.  Everyone has something weird about them, I think this one is fairly harmless.", "NTA for finding all of this odd. But, they are not really hurting anyone. If Mr. Blueface starts committing felonies then it's a different story. Right now, it's just a silly twin thing, right?  I wouldn't encourage it by participating in any way.  But maybe you can see this as child like rather than childish to help take the annoying edge off. \n\nIf you want to stay with Miguel then please do not take your sister's advice.

A bond literally only other twins get. I find it interesting he said it\u2019s how they talk. Maybe instead of another language which is common w twins it\u2019s literally Mr Blueface. Either way I think that I\u2019d say NTA if he literally brought him up every single time y\u2019all ever were together but since it\u2019s sprinkled YTA.

This is a twin thing, not all twins, but twins often have a relationship that can\u2019t be replicated and Mr Blueface is a part of their twin relationship.

Since your boyfriend loves Mr. Blueface so much and can\u2019t bear to part with his imaginary friend, maybe it\u2019s time to break up with him to make room for a boyfriend who doesn\u2019t have such strange behaviors they participate in.\n\nOnce you let him go, he can finally be free to focus all of his attention on his relationships with his brother and Mr. Blueface. Years from now, he won\u2019t be able to deny his feelings anymore and will finally be able to just flat out marry him, and there is nothing more enjoyable and absolutely laughable than the idea of an ex-boyfriend skipping down the aisle by themselves to join in holy matrimony with someone who doesn\u2019t exist.\n\n\u201c*I now pronounce you husband and Mr. Blueface.

If they say it constantly then ok but you said it was only occasionally, if it makes them both happy then who cares?", "YTA. No explanation needed", "NTA It isn't going to go away. Quite often children 'forget' about their imaginary friend unless their parents constantly reminded them, or in this case their twin constantly reminds them. So they each reinforce the memory and interaction with the imaginary friend. It isn't concerning unless Mr Blue face shows any concerning behaviours, spite, malice, nastiness, rudeness, anger etc. You have to decide if you want both a twin and Mr Blueface in your relationship with your bf.", "NAH.
