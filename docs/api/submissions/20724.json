Someone's crazy and it isn't you.", "NTA - Intent wasn't there. You expected to see NO ONE", "I was thinking of saying you're T.A. simply because *I* didn't get invited...  /s   \n\nNTA.  It's a public place.", "I remember, when I was a kid, the saying, \"well it's a free country\" meaning I can go and do what I want, when I want.  That applies to this.  Even if OP had known about it (we know OP didn't), OP has every right for margis (which are delicious and I don't blame OP for wanting them)!  This drama queen was being just that. \n\nI hope you were able to get past her and enjoy yourself. *cheers* (NTA)", "I would argue if OP had intentionally gone to the venue of a coworker\u2019s retirement party that she wasn\u2019t invited to and she knew that coworker didn\u2019t like her, then that would indeed make OP an AH. However, that\u2019s not what happened here. NTA", "And it's a typical Monday thing... so it's routine. If the former coworker had wanted you not to show up, they should have recommended somewhere else.", "Only way it would make sense is if OP is leaving out something big.  Like, he\u2019s always been an asshole to the former coworker.  Or blamed her for something he did and she got fired.  I\u2019m curious what she meant when she said he \u201calways ruins things.\u201d", "IDK, but the coworker is dim enough to try to do farewell drinks without OP at a place and time where OP normally frequents. And not let the other participants know to exclude OP, either! OP may not be entirely clueless about the supposed reason for the coworker\u2019s dislike of them, but it\u2019s not reasonable to expect that it\u2019s a rational reason.", "Also considering this sounds like it\u2019s at a restaurant. I would understand if it was at the ex coworkers house but OP has every right to go to a restaurant. Sounds like they need to block this person and ignore them", "I'm not the best at these things but I would take the voice recording to HR and document this.  That way she has that on her record if she ever tries to come back.   NTA", "Dumb and irrational doesn't mean something didn't happen.. hell, it could be that he cut her off in traffic. Only her, and maybe OP, knows.\n\nHeck, they even exchanged personal info at one point, or at least a way for her to send him a voice note.. im just not buying this fallout where OP didn't participate in her feeling this way, even if it isn't rational.", "Info: are you a guy or a girl?", "I\u2019m a guy.", "You\u2019re being awfully credulous here. If you wanted to exclude someone from a party, why would you hold it at the place and time of a weekly event that you know they regularly attend?", "Oh agreed, there is no world in which the coworker wasn't being ridiculous, especially with the blow up.\n\nBut I'm a bit shocked to see everyone down voting that person for saying that it _would_ be inappropriate to deliberately insert yourself where you know you're not wanted and not invited. We all accept that that isn't what happened here, but I truly don't understand the disagreement with that statement because that poster is 100% right. I know reddit and social norms have a rather strained relationship, but damn lol.", "Reddit has trouble reading at times, then once you get a few down votes some people will down vote you without reading", "I assumed it was because they assumed OP might have gone there out of spite when OP didn't even know anything was going on that night as there was nothing in the group chat.", "You know what I find hilarious? These coworkers are  both transparent and socially saavy. They know former coworker is a nut, they know she wanted an excluive/exclusionary event and they refused to play along! They sidled right on up to the disliked coworker and got the party started without the guest of honor! I also notice that none of them chased after her when she stormed out!\n\n\nLet the good times roll! NTA", "NTA\n\nThis is entirely speculation (and also based on purely 0 information but it\u2019s fun to assume things), but I bet she had a crush on you and when she found out you didn\u2019t feel the same she started disliking you in order to deal with that. Total shot in the dark, but you never know.\n\nHave a nice day \ud83d\udc4d :)", "INFO \n\nHow do you \u201calways ruin things\u201d? What history do you have with this woman? I find it hard to believe she acted this way towards you and you not knowing why. So what did you do?", "NTA!   \nBut someone knows what's going on with this lunatic. In case you're na\u00efve, the reason the usual email didn't go out was so that you would assume that the gathering wasn't happening and therefore not show up.   \nYou should fill in HR on the voice mail and also try to get to the bottom of this for your own protection.", "NTA \u2014 someone sounds like they just enjoy being petty and having all attention on them. Honestly, you probably didn\u2019t do anything to her. Some people just live for the drama.", "Share that lil voice note with HR", "There is no way to spin this where you're the AH. NTA", "NTA OP.  Former coworker sounds like a drama queen.", "NTA. Um. You went on your own, they sat with you and the only person making a big deal is the childish coworker.", "YTA, but only because you didn't bring enough margs for everyone.\" \ud83c\udf79\ud83d\udc40", "NTA\n\nlook on the bright side, she is now a \u201cformer\u201c coworker", "NTA\n\nHope all your coworkers aren\u2019t this insecure.", "NTA\n\nYou went a restaurant. Are you just not supposed to ever go anywhere where said coworker can see you?", "This deserves a medal \ud83e\udd47", "One thing about her is that she is habitually very late. Even to her own events.", "She\u2019s a lesbian soooo. But honestly that\u2019s a fair a guess.", "I really didn\u2019t do anything. She also acts this way towards another coworker. Literally she will hate someone for breathing in a way she doesn\u2019t like.", "lol sure they do.", "Additionally, OP needs to have a large retractable wall installed that auto-extends when former coworker is within eyesight they will never be reminded that OP exists within the house.\n\nOr possibly they should just look at obscuring the entire neighbourhood, to be safe.", "Maybe if co-worker didnt want to see you, she shouldnt have planned a going away party at the regular monday hangout spot? \ud83e\udd37\n\n NTA", "Maybe your new business card is a better design than hers?", "So probably not then LOL", "It\u2019s one thing if it\u2019s a private space, but it\u2019s a restaurant. I don\u2019t have to avoid people who dislike me for no reason, especially if I don\u2019t know they\u2019re going to be present.", "Just because that isn't the situation. People will go on a 94 paragraph tangent. :)", "Right, but that would be irrelevant to the downvoting as that poster's comment specifically addressed hypothetical circumstances in which OP _did_ know that and did it anyway. And correctly points out that _had that been the case_, it would have changed things.\n\nIf you know you're not invited and/or not wanted, but show up and insert yourself into that group, that would indeed be inappropriate regardless of whether the area is public or private. In that case you could feel free to use the public restaurant as any other patron would, without inviting yourself to the group that chose not to include you.", "Even then, reacting angrily to something like that is just strange.", "Though when it's just one person in that group that didn't want you there and the others choose to go to you, I don't see any problem with deciding you don't gaf what that one person thinks about you. Especially if you're not doing anything to contribute to that chasm between you and that one person other than just being present.", "I didn't assume downvotes meant angry? I assumed it meant you disagree?", "NTA. She doesn't own the place.", "How could you possibly be the A here?  You were completely unaware that your former co-worker was even going to be at the restaurant that evening.\n\nThe way you were treated is unconscionable, and make me very happy you no longer have to work with this person.  And I'm sure that your current co-workers who witnessed the hissy fit are grateful for this too, and realize that the fault here doesn't lie with you!\n\nNTA", "Tell her to eat shit.\n\nNTA, she doesn't own the place.. tell her if she calls your phone again acting crazy you'll break her fucking nose.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23 I would move this to the entitled people sub\u2026 \n\nNTA drinks made are to be sold, it\u2019s a (supposedly) free country, drink where you like. NTA", "NTA. You need to meet with HR and show them the voice note. She's harassing you (multiple times now) and is creating a hostile working environment.", "NTA\n\nShe expected you to psychically know she didn't want you at this restaurant that night but wouldn't tell you. She also felt she had more right to be there than you. \n\nIdc if you're leaving out details that make you the biggest jerk in the world to her, you still wouldn't be in the wrong her. You went to a restaurant with no intention of seeing anyone there it was just gonna be you and your spouse. You didn't go over to join her group seeing her already there, her group joined you before she ever got there. \n\nShe needs to grow up and realise not everything is about her. Thank your lucky stars that this woman is leaving.", "Def NTA.   Is there some sort of unrequited love thing going on ? \nThe love thing happened with two  colleagues of mine last year. \nShe 1  decided she had feelings for she  2. \n 2 didn't have a clue and wouldn't have reciprocated anyway.  1 proceeded to try to ruin 2s work life and friendships.", "NTA - she\u2019s definitely a bully. She obviously knew it was Marg Monday and tried to hijack and exclude you. It backfired and now she\u2019s mad. She\u2019s going away forever so just forget her. She\u2019s crazy anyways.", "NTA, she doesn't own the place. Enjoy your margaritas.", "How do you ruin \"everything\" for her? She's a huge drama queen. I'd send her a little purple crown that says so. NTA", "And he ruins EVERYTHING!", "Right? Like if I wanted to avoid someone and knew they regularly attended a specific place every week on the day I want to plan something on, I'd rub two brain cells together and make plans for some other place."]}
