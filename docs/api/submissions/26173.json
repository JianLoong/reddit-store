Not a lawyer here, but first grandma needs to plan for the inheritance to care for her daughter to be put  into a trust with daughter as beneficiary. Then she selects your fianc\u00e9 to be the trustee. This gives grandma peace of mind to comfortably  die. This is what grandma seems to be asking for.\n\nOnce grandma dies,  the trustee of the inheritance for the beneficiary decides when and what amounts the money is given  out. Your fianc\u00e9, as the trustee, also choses whether she wants to continue that role or whether she wants to assign a financial institute to take the role. Grandma just needs to know that someone will be responsible for this so that her daughter will not be homeless.\n\nHave a conversation with fianc\u00e9 and don\u2019t forget that there are no guarantees in life: grandma  *may* even outlive  biological mother rendering this situation a complete non-issue.\n\nRemember \u201cwhat if\u201d situations are not real, so do not let them become real problems in your relationship.\n\nNow\u2026.if fiance is a total mamas boy/girl about stuff and constantly is putting moms needs and opinions before yours, RUN far and fast!\n\nBest wishes to you. Talk to an estate planner!", "OP does have a say. He can say no to the marriage.  He can also refuse to provide any financial support for FMIL from his earnings. Let fiance support her mother from her earnings. \n\nOP could also state that there will be no children as long as FMIL lives with them as he refuses to subject chidren to living in that environment.  He could tell fiance that he will consider getting snipped to make sure that there are no children. \n\nThere are a lot of ways to say no to lay out the consequences of the wife's decision.\n\nQuestion,  can fiance support her mother without any financial aid from OP?", "I get why Grandma wants that but I think that she would also realise that after taking on her Granddaughter as her own that having her around kids is not okay without some major change.\nI suppose what I'm getting at is there is a starting point for compromise that you all need to talk about, rather than dismissing out of hand. I would include fianc\u00e9e's brother in it to if there's an arrangement that could be come to to split costs or something. I agree it shouldn't be a free pass for potential mother in law, but hopefully it won't be relationship ending either.\nHave the conversations now and plan out so Grandma can feel comfortable, fiancee knows it not that you don't have compassion and don't want to help her mom and maybe brother can see it doesn't mean moving in and won't all fall on his shoulders. Planning and open conversation is key.", "Her health is going to fail and she won't be able to live on her own.  The family's intention is that she live with you and your wife be her caregiver in the end. I get that there are emotions.  I get that some people believe they can move family members into the marital home by right.  I do not get planning to do that without discussion.  I'm sorry, but that is a betrayal of trust.  Do not marry until your gf can see that, talk about it, resolve how future decisions will be made.  You obviously have conflicts in ethics here, no matter who is right.  You need to work through them before marriage.", "Cancel both the wedding g, and the house search.  Whatever you do, do not buy a property with your girlfriend.", "But fuck her mom, right?", "\"nd it seems like she was just saying that to appease her grandma while in conversation,\" ... She is Lying to her grandma about important things and making empty promisses. How could you trust someone like that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" Her grandma isn\u2019t putting her on her will to inherit the house because she knows she would destroy that place in no time. \" ... And shy likely is lying to grandma so she will inherit the house. While already planning not to keep her side of the deal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat else but a major AH could she ever be?", "Well, you don't get something like a house for nothing in this world. I think it's a good trade off. You are not a victim here. Can you find a way to section off the house to give your mil her own apartment?\n\nEdited to add: if you don't intend to live in the house yourself, can the house be arranged so your mil has a roommate or two to cover house expenses?", "And has she the means to replace it ? If not then perhaps grandma can stump up the cost of it", "I think you may have replied to the wrong person as I didn\u2019t say any of that stuff", "This isn\u2019t to say we are pushing this down the road. We\u2019re actively discussing this and not tying any knots until this is resolved. We both have similar interests and wants in life. This is one of the few things we\u2019re differing on, but even then we\u2019re talking it out.", "Exactly. The most likely scenario is once they\u2019re married and have a house and kids, OP\u2019s then wife will just move her mother into their home.\n\nEta - they\u2019re not even close to being on the same page about the MIL. OP doesn\u2019t want her around any future kids, which is understandable. His fianc\u00e9e is ready to move her mom into their home.", "That\u2019s why we\u2019re taking our time with figuring out options. Other commenters have been helpful with suggesting another trailer or care housing so we\u2019re gonna look into those options.", "I\u2019m not taking her in. I\u2019m not moving on that.", "Easy to say when you\u2019re not in the situation around the family. My fianc\u00e9 and I agree on most of our philosophies and thankfully she is the exact opposite of her mom. And thankfully we only really see her around holiday get together kind of deals.", "That\u2019s why I\u2019m not \u201cleave right now red flags blah blah\u201d like everyone else is. This is a big thing to be discussed and emotions for everyone will be effected. We\u2019re taking our time to get this right.", "Thats what we\u2019re doing thankfully. Most of my family ended up being friends and friends of friends that needed a place to stay, so I\u2019m not against opening our home to people in need. I\u2019m against opening our home to disaster people however.", "Druggie, racist and thief. Do not want her in my home or around my future kid without us around.", "Her grandma is pretty severe. I wouldn\u2019t have put it past her to kick my fianc\u00e9 out if she did straight up tell her anything but yes.\n\nBut we also don\u2019t want grandmas house since it\u2019s on the older side. Which in turn would leave it to her brother and he can take care of himself, so that\u2019s not an issue.", "We already have a couple of houses in mind, because we personally don\u2019t want this one.\n\nSecondly, her mom is not someone you can live with or would want any child around.", "Grandma doesn\u2019t want her to live in a place where she has ownership of it because it will be ruined within months.", "I'd suggest seeking couples therapy. Before seeing the therapist brainstorm ideas which will result in your mil not being homeless and also not living with you. Ideas which can become viable options.", "What you don't seem to be realizing is that MIL is moving in immediately upon your marriage.  This is not down the road.  This is an immediate consequence of marriage.  If you can't bear to break up, at least don't marry, buy a house yourself in your name, and tell them all that MIL will never live there.", "Can grandma leave future MIL enough $ to pay her bills at the trailer? Maybe on an income basis so she doesn\u2019t blow it?", "Build her a shed in the garden she can live in", "My man, just be sure to reiterate how making decisions for the both of you with your input needs not to happen. I think that\u2019s a bigger problem than the mother in law situation.", "So what even do you imagine as the outline of a plan that is acceptable to you both?\n\nAlso, why does your fianc\u00e9e's brother get to just say no, but you and your fianc\u00e9e do not?", "That's the smartest option.  Read it is so black and white and life isn't.  I'm glad you can see that.  Good luck, I hope it works out for you.  Also, consider the half-and-half deal with the brother in law and remember that care homes are also a wonderful thing, just find one that cares for their patients.  Or don't, she frankly sounds horrible and if she's anything like my fiancee mom who he is no contact with, then a bad care home is better than a nice one.", "I'm glad you seem to be being able to work through it! Good luck to the both of you, hope you have a long and happy future together", "You probably shouldn\u2019t marry her. This isn\u2019t going to go away. One of you will probably end up resenting the other.", "Can you set it up so your mil lives in the house with a roommate or two to help cover house expenses? You still come out ahead as the house will be in your name and you will inherit the equity when your mil dies.", "But she is living in a trailer now . So replacing a trailer for her isn\u2019t such a huge leap though. Grandma can cough up as this is her child and not yours", "Thankfully we are taking a course with our officiator and it\u2019s very helpful. Our next meeting is gonna end up being exclusively about this since this happened between sessions.", "She\u2019s not moving in and I\u2019ve made that clear. We are talking about the alternatives though.", "Worst (maybe best) case is she\u2019s just left on her own.\n\nWe are talking about getting her another trailer, or convincing her to go into some care housing and maybe she can get some help that way.", "I\u2019m not living with someone or raising a kid around someone that is a druggie, a racist or a thief and she\u2019s all three.", "I\u2019ll be more than happy to help with funding another trailer or some sort of care housing. But that\u2019s the line. Her own mom doesn\u2019t even trust to give the place to her outright.", "Seeing an officiator can be a good thing. However any counseling linked to any religious organization often promotes keeping a family together. Ie. You taking your mil in. \n\nIf your officiator does not have this bias then your good. If they do you may end up living with mil. \n\nBest of luck", "Get an objective point of view as well, not just the officiator (who I'm assuming is a member of your church?). Someone who has a background in family therapy and dynamics, maybe?", "Maybe MIL could set up inheritance with a trust or annuity that just pays for living expenses every month or holds the ownership of a home the horrible mother can live in but not sell.", "And do you feel confident in that plan?\n\nOr will your home be the safety net when everything else falls through?", "Maybe you don't have to live with her. She can live in grandmother's house with a roommate or two. You act as landlord. \n\nThe reality is that your wife is not going to let her mom be homeless, so doing nothing is off the table.", "What will you do with the house?", "Good idea, I appreciate it", "We\u2019re not church goers ourselves, but I\u2019m open to a second opinion that isn\u2019t religious first.", "Yes I\u2019m confident in that. Im open to having people of our home when they need it and what not, but not people that are druggies, racist or thiefs. Family or not.", "Since we\u2019re not taking it, it will go to her brother and he\u2019s already stated he wants nothing to do with her, having already spent a good portion of his youth with her.", "\"But it's my mother, I can't let her live on the streets.\" Get ready for that one.\n\nPerhaps some kind of irrevocable trust to cover your mother's expenses? Barring that, your fianc\u00e9e is going to cave. I think everybody knows that.", "I think you should develop the house in some way to help pay for your mil. Either she lives in it with roommates or you rent it out to help pay for her trailer housing. If your mil ends up homeless, it could be the end of your marriage as the tension may destroy your relationship with your conflicted wife.", "OP, we got some serious facts being laid down. Getting married, combining finances, and having babies will only set you up for the above mentioned manipulation tactic.  Are you prepared to die on that hill with all that leveraged against you?"]}
