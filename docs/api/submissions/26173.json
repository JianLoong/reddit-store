She could also set up her will - money or house- to be in a trust that your fiance could manage so that she ensures her mother is being smart with money. That has limits too of course, but it could be used to ensure she can pay rent, has an emergency fund for health issues, etc. You could help your fiance by ensuring MIL is signed up for and keeps on top of benefits (like retirement and health care).
