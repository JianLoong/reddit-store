A specialist in eating disorders. EDs are complex and dangerous, and you are at severe risk of a shorter, harder life. Tell your mother you want counselling, and you want her to come too. (Some of the session can be where your counsellor talks with HER about this, and some of it can be for you alone).", "Not easy to vote. You are not healthy and it seems like your parents feel helpless about it. They care about you. We don\u2019t need to talk about, that this not the right way (forcing to eat). But please try to understand your parents as well. Try to find a way with them (such as \u201cwhat can I do and what would help me from you\u201d).", "NAH, I was in your shoes once. When you\u2019re deep into an eating disorder or any mental health disorder other people, (especially close friends and family) can mean the best and want to help you and pull you out of it, but when you\u2019re in the grip of it, no one understands.\n\nI strongly encourage you to seek professional help. You said you\u2019re sixteen, it sounds like your parents want to help, but by yelling about you finishing plates it\u2019s not helpful (at least it wasn\u2019t for me when I was your age and struggling with anorexia). I only survived because of family therapy. I hope you and your family are open to it and you get the support you need!\n\nI\u2019m sending good vibes your way", "I wouldn't say you're an AH, but it sounds like your mother is highly concerned about how skinny you are and you may need medical intervention so your family and yourself can get through your eating disorder.", "Your grandmother is right, actually.  Your parents' approach is not helping.\n\nNAH, because you are clearly in trouble and your parents are clearly worried out of their minds.  You all need to go to therapy and you need help with your eating disorder.  Typically, eating disorders are born out of a need to control something and food is frequently the only thing we feel we can control.  That's part of what you really need to get help with.  Your parents' approach is continuing to erode that control, which is why it's making this worse.", "I wanna say ESH. Just because i dont think it\u2019s your fault but OP you need a therapist. I saw somewhere in the comments that you visited a doctor already but clearly you are still dealing with the ED problem.\n\nYou need a professional to help guide you out of these struggles. Your mom, definitely shouldn\u2019t have reacted that way, but I feel like this is been beating around the bush for a while. \n\nIf you know it\u2019s a problem then you know it has to be resolved working with a therapist and yourself. An ED isnt a healthy problem to have, it isn\u2019t a dietary restriction that has to be respected it\u2019s a mental health struggle that has to be helped, it will only get worse if you don\u2019t address it now.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is a huge AH.\nSo her daughter has an eating disorder and she didn't give a sh*t about looking it up and actually educating her self about it for her sake?\n\nSo what if she cooked for you?\nIf she would rather you force it down your throat then throw it all up later just to make her self feel better then this woman is a horrible human being, that's just  pure evil AND clear abuse.\n\nShe's just tired of dealing with this, even though it's clear she never bothered to really help, and wants to pretend that you were fine, and she wants you to play along knowing it will harm you and maybe never allow you to really heal.\nWho said you can easily get over it by forcing yourself to eat regularly?\n\nOP, You seriously need to leave this house right now, you will never get better if they kept this attitude up, and you need to talk with your therapist to help you not to let your parents do more damage than they already did.\nThis is a hard disorder to over come, it may even take a year or two, so you will need all your strength for your healing journey along with people who are here to support your like your grandmother, you can't waste your energy and mental health on people who will just drag you down.", "This isn\u2019t really an AH situation, this a \u201cyou have a serious problem and need to seek medical help\u201d situation.\n\nYour mother didn\u2019t handle it great, but she\u2019s probably frustrated because you\u2019ve been doing this for a while\u2026 she has probably tried being nice, tried asking, tried other things, so now she\u2019s trying shame.  It\u2019s not the best but based on what you\u2019re saying, she\u2019s at her wits end.\n\nYou need help. \n\nIf I have to choose one, YTA, but really it\u2019s not an AH situation.  Seek help.", "You definitely arent the asshole.   \nSometimes It can be hard to confront your parents over stuff like this maybe ask your grandmother to help you out in talking to your parents and go get some help from a therapist.   \nI know you already did but it was right after this argument. Wait a day or two until your parents have cooled down a little and wont bring anger into the talk", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Some of the comments you have made have been concerning and seems like you are not understanding the complexity of this condition. Your parents are scared and trying to help, yes this particular incident was not a good way but I promise they just want to help. I was anorexic in high school and took me until college to finally get to a truly healthy weight. I still struggle with proper body dysmorphia and effects my mood. This is going to be likely a lifelong battle but it gets easier. \n\nMy mom has recently told me about how scared she was when I was very sick. She would cry in bed every night because she didn\u2019t know what to do. Sure she yelled at me a few times when I refused to eat too but they want their baby healthy. \n\nThe sooner you can get to a healthy weight, the quicker you will notice some of the negative side effects that you do not notice now going away. One that hurt me a lot was hair loss, I lost a lot of my hair in high school and then it finally started coming back in more full again in college but it also was completely different. I was blonde, wavy hair and now brown and very curly. It took some getting use to.", "my grandmother goes with me when i attend counseling sessions, and so far, she is trying to tell everyone of what they should know about my condition and how to help me, yet my mother thinks differently- she believes i have to eat and eat to get over it.", "i am considering how my family views my situation, i try to do my best to eat with them if i can, i sometimes tell them whether i plan to eat for the day or not so they're aware. but thank you.", "i'm glad a lot of people understand! i will try to talk to my family about family therapy. i visit my doctors, and other professionals that may help with my condition twice a month, still, thank you for reminding and for the good vibes.", "thank you for considering, i may have overlooked this as i was very offended and hurt.", "you have a very good point, op. thank you very much for considering my view and theirs.", "my psychiatrist explained many factors that make it hard for me to recover from ed- yet i see your point and will take a note of this.", "i have already consulted doctors, psychiatrists, and therapists. i do not think i need medical help anymore, as i am aware of how my body responds and reacts to situations. but thank you, op.", "That sucks. Maybe your grandmother can be your ally and get your mum to go to counselling too?", "I'm so sorry. And your mother is mistaken, she's making herself part of the problem.", "One thing I meant to add, but didn't.  You parents are very wrong that an eating disorder is easy to get over.  This isn't some silly thing that you can snap your fingers and then are ok.  It's not at all.  Eating disorders can be related to so many things to include OCD and anxiety.  I know you are really struggling and I hope there is a calm adult that can help you find the kind of therapy that you truly need.  Good luck, OP.  I'm rooting for you.", "If you still have an eating disorder and it's still impacting you this much you very seriously need medical help. This could kill you."]}
