A specialist in eating disorders. EDs are complex and dangerous, and you are at severe risk of a shorter, harder life. Tell your mother you want counselling, and you want her to come too. (Some of the session can be where your counsellor talks with HER about this, and some of it can be for you alone).", "Not easy to vote. You are not healthy and it seems like your parents feel helpless about it. They care about you. We don\u2019t need to talk about, that this not the right way (forcing to eat). But please try to understand your parents as well. Try to find a way with them (such as \u201cwhat can I do and what would help me from you\u201d).", "NAH, I was in your shoes once. When you\u2019re deep into an eating disorder or any mental health disorder other people, (especially close friends and family) can mean the best and want to help you and pull you out of it, but when you\u2019re in the grip of it, no one understands.\n\nI strongly encourage you to seek professional help. You said you\u2019re sixteen, it sounds like your parents want to help, but by yelling about you finishing plates it\u2019s not helpful (at least it wasn\u2019t for me when I was your age and struggling with anorexia). I only survived because of family therapy. I hope you and your family are open to it and you get the support you need!\n\nI\u2019m sending good vibes your way", "I wouldn't say you're an AH, but it sounds like your mother is highly concerned about how skinny you are and you may need medical intervention so your family and yourself can get through your eating disorder.", "Your grandmother is right, actually.  Your parents' approach is not helping.\n\nNAH, because you are clearly in trouble and your parents are clearly worried out of their minds.  You all need to go to therapy and you need help with your eating disorder.  Typically, eating disorders are born out of a need to control something and food is frequently the only thing we feel we can control.  That's part of what you really need to get help with.  Your parents' approach is continuing to erode that control, which is why it's making this worse.", "I wanna say ESH. Just because i dont think it\u2019s your fault but OP you need a therapist. I saw somewhere in the comments that you visited a doctor already but clearly you are still dealing with the ED problem.\n\nYou need a professional to help guide you out of these struggles. Your mom, definitely shouldn\u2019t have reacted that way, but I feel like this is been beating around the bush for a while. \n\nIf you know it\u2019s a problem then you know it has to be resolved working with a therapist and yourself. An ED isnt a healthy problem to have, it isn\u2019t a dietary restriction that has to be respected it\u2019s a mental health struggle that has to be helped, it will only get worse if you don\u2019t address it now.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is a huge AH.\nSo her daughter has an eating disorder and she didn't give a sh*t about looking it up and actually educating her self about it for her sake?\n\nSo what if she cooked for you?\nIf she would rather you force it down your throat then throw it all up later just to make her self feel better then this woman is a horrible human being, that's just  pure evil AND clear abuse.\n\nShe's just tired of dealing with this, even though it's clear she never bothered to really help, and wants to pretend that you were fine, and she wants you to play along knowing it will harm you and maybe never allow you to really heal.\nWho said you can easily get over it by forcing yourself to eat regularly?\n\nOP, You seriously need to leave this house right now, you will never get better if they kept this attitude up, and you need to talk with your therapist to help you not to let your parents do more damage than they already did.\nThis is a hard disorder to over come, it may even take a year or two, so you will need all your strength for your healing journey along with people who are here to support your like your grandmother, you can't waste your energy and mental health on people who will just drag you down.", "This isn\u2019t really an AH situation, this a \u201cyou have a serious problem and need to seek medical help\u201d situation.\n\nYour mother didn\u2019t handle it great, but she\u2019s probably frustrated because you\u2019ve been doing this for a while\u2026 she has probably tried being nice, tried asking, tried other things, so now she\u2019s trying shame.  It\u2019s not the best but based on what you\u2019re saying, she\u2019s at her wits end.\n\nYou need help. \n\nIf I have to choose one, YTA, but really it\u2019s not an AH situation.  Seek help.", "You definitely arent the asshole.   \nSometimes It can be hard to confront your parents over stuff like this maybe ask your grandmother to help you out in talking to your parents and go get some help from a therapist.   \nI know you already did but it was right after this argument.

Some of the comments you have made have been concerning and seems like you are not understanding the complexity of this condition. Your parents are scared and trying to help, yes this particular incident was not a good way but I promise they just want to help. I was anorexic in high school and took me until college to finally get to a truly healthy weight. I still struggle with proper body dysmorphia and effects my mood. This is going to be likely a lifelong battle but it gets easier. \n\nMy mom has recently told me about how scared she was when I was very sick. She would cry in bed every night because she didn\u2019t know what to do. Sure she yelled at me a few times when I refused to eat too but they want their baby healthy. \n\nThe sooner you can get to a healthy weight, the quicker you will notice some of the negative side effects that you do not notice now going away. One that hurt me a lot was hair loss, I lost a lot of my hair in high school and then it finally started coming back in more full again in college but it also was completely different. I was blonde, wavy hair and now brown and very curly. It took some getting use to.", "my grandmother goes with me when i attend counseling sessions, and so far, she is trying to tell everyone of what they should know about my condition and how to help me, yet my mother thinks differently- she believes i have to eat and eat to get over it.", "i am considering how my family views my situation, i try to do my best to eat with them if i can, i sometimes tell them whether i do not feel like eating for the day or not so they're aware. but thank you.\n\nedited*", "i'm glad a lot of people understand! i will try to talk to my family about family therapy. i visit my doctors, and other professionals that may help with my condition twice a month, still, thank you for reminding and for the good vibes.", "thank you for considering, i may have overlooked this as i was very offended and hurt.", "you have a very good point, op. thank you very much for considering my view and theirs.", "my psychiatrist explained many factors that make it hard for me to recover from ed- yet i see your point and will take a note of this.", "i have already consulted doctors, psychiatrists, and therapists. i do not think i need medical help anymore, as i am aware of how my body responds and reacts to situations. but thank you, op.", "That sucks. Maybe your grandmother can be your ally and get your mum to go to counselling too?", "I'm so sorry. And your mother is mistaken, she's making herself part of the problem.", "One thing I meant to add, but didn't.  You parents are very wrong that an eating disorder is easy to get over.  This isn't some silly thing that you can snap your fingers and then are ok.  It's not at all.  Eating disorders can be related to so many things to include OCD and anxiety.  I know you are really struggling and I hope there is a calm adult that can help you find the kind of therapy that you truly need.  Good luck, OP.  I'm rooting for you.", "If you still have an eating disorder and it's still impacting you this much you very seriously need medical help. This could kill you.", "no, you\u2019re not the asshole. you\u2019re traumatized and mentally ill, being treated horribly because of it.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is a fool thinking shaming you into eating is gonna make you hungry.  I hope you're in therapy.  She should go to a session so a therapist could politely call her out on her asshole behavior.\n\nI wish you well OP.  I hope you find your yum!", "NTA\n\nBut what treatment are you seeking for your eating disorder? You understand that you have a problem, which is a good start. It seems like your core problem here is that your mother doesn't understand your condition or how best to treat it. \n\nYou say in a comment that you're in counseling, which is good. I'm sure that your mother's behavior is driven by her concern about you, but her saying that you could just get over your problems if you ate the meals she cooked isn't helpful.\n\nYou need to have a plan that is agreed with your family about how you're going to deal with eating, and with ensuring that you get adequate nutrition, and your family needs to follow that plan.", "YTA. If it tastes bad just eat a bit and drink something with your meal, if you really think her food is harmful call CPS.", "ESH.  You need to override those disordered impulses to not eat and to eat a reasonable amount anyway.  Your hunger signals are not working properly, and you cannot depend on them.   However, despite the concern and hurt your mom feels, she went the wrong way about it on multiple levels.", "You're not the asshole, and your mom's being overly emotional, making it about her and sort of oblivious to the reality of eating disorders, but she's right to be worried about you and you can't keep on doing this.", "I think a lot of the concern coming from people in the comments is that the language you are using sounds very much like someone deep into their ED and not someone in recovery.\n\nI've personally known someone in complete denial about their anorexia who claimed that they were doing well because they were eating until they were full, but they were still getting less than 500 calories a day and often going whole days without eating. It's terrifying not knowing what to do to help or open their eyes to the fact that they are very much not healthy. From that perspective, hearing you say that you aren't underweight but often have no eating days... is hard to believe. I know that when I struggled with bulimia, I regularly told myself that I didn't need to eat on a particular day because I had binged the day before, regardless of how long I kept it down. \n\n\nIt's good that you are mindful about taking supplements. There's nothing wrong with living off of meal replacement shakes if that's what works for you.  I'm so sorry that your family makes eating stressful and negative for you. Don't be hard on yourself. You deserve kindness. \n\nHonestly, I don't know if complete recovery is going to be possible while you are living with your mom. Do you have the option of moving in with your grandma? Getting your mom in a family therapist session so she can learn how detrimental her attitude is is great in theory- but not if it's just going to give her more strategies to hurt you. She has to be genuinely interested in supporting you rather than just getting you to behave in a way she finds acceptable.", "She details the help she is getting in her comments.", "If you still have whole days where you eat nothing then 2x a month at therapy is not nearly enough. Especially as you believe it\u2019s perfectly OK to decide not to eat that day and that informing your parents this is a non-eating day should result in them shutting up and supporting your decision for that day.", "> whether i **plan** to eat for the day or not so they're aware.\n\nIt seems like you are equating *can't* eat and *won't* eat and that's a huge part of your issue. The issue is not that you are physically incapable of eating and your family is trying to force you to do something you can't. Your family is begging you to do something you have to do to *live* and you won't! There cannot be any days where you do not eat at all. You have to eat at least a little every single day. If you truly **cannot** do that, you need to be in inpatient treatment because that's a medical emergency.", "The fact that you have non-eating days is very concerning. And not healthy. Your mother is probably afraid you'll starve yourself. You definitely need to go therapy more than twice a month because you dont have this under control.", "You need medical help.  If you are not eating multiple times every day, you have a serious problem.  Your body is malfunctioning in those responses and reactions.  You are not OK.", "i think it's valid with the amount of food i eat the day before and after? i don't starve myself, i just don't eat when i feel like my body cannot take anymore food and has had enough, which is, according to the doctor, fine. i still take supplements, and eat foods where the nutrients i need are in. i don't totally **not** eat.", "i forgot to mention that i still eat what i can and need in the days i really don't feel like eating as well. again, i take supplements with the food/s i eat.", "i have non eating days as i get concerned over my weight and how my stomach rejects the food i try to eat every once in a while.", "i may not be eating multiple times a day, but i eat what i need to, and what i can. nutrients are still highly present in the foods i eat as i take supplements with them.", "Are these \"supplements\" meal replacements or just pills like vitamins? Because one has some nutrition, the other doesn't feed you. \n\nYou do need a basic level of caloric intake.  I'm so sorry that you have had trauma that caused these issues. I hope you can heal from it. \n\nWhen the family or people you live with don't have the knowledge or emotional capacity to support us how we need. You deserve that. And I hope things better for you soon.", "But without the proper therapy it can be a slippery slope. It can happen, that you'll feel like \"today is the day I won't eat\" will happen more often and then your other \"eating days\" could be not enough to keep you safe.  \nAnorexia is much about having control over something in your life.", "Then why couldn't you eat a little bit with them?", "In another comment you said you don\u2019t totally not eat but here you say you do have non-eating days. They can\u2019t both be true.", "That means you arent dealing with your ED if you are concerned over your weight to choose not to eat.", "It doesn't matter if you're taking vitamins if you're not getting enough CALORIES to maintain your body. Your body will still shut down.\n\nThe idea that vitamins mean you don't need to eat is the eating disorder talking. You are unwell.", "Supplements are not enough.   You are not getting the calories and micronutrients you need.  You need to eat multiple times a day, and to make yourself do it.", "meal replacements, i cannot take pills as i was not taught how to properly drink them and i am very much afraid that one might get stuck in my throat one day.\n\nthank you very much for your sincere words.", "thank you for this, i'll keep it in mind. but no, it is not anorexia i am experiencing !", "my mom pressures me into doing so, and i feel uncomfortable. she's also the reason why i gained such trauma response.", "please read my added disclaimer, op. i am very much sorry for the misunderstanding and for not using proper terms.", "i am aware of this and i may not be consuming enough calories, yes, but i am working on it by eating foods that give me not just enough calories, but more, whenever i can and am able to.", "But she pressures you into eating because you refuse to eat. Eating is something you *have* to do, no matter how you feel about it. What you are doing is like refusing to breathe. Of course your family is worried and upset and trying to force you to do it, you need air and food to live. Trying to get you to keep doing the things you need to do to live is the only reasonable reaction anyone could have in response to your actions.", "Do you eat food on your non-eating days or just take supplements? Your edit seems very carefully worded.", "You're describing binging. \n\nYou need help. You cannot manage this alone.", "i get your point, but what i mean by her pressuring me is how she tells me to eat fast, to eat a lot. she would go as far as adding more food that i can no longer consume while it is visible that i am already struggling. i do not think that what she is doing should be taken in a positive light as she is aware about my condition", "i eat food, and i sometimes eat more than i intend to. i cannot go on a day without at least consuming rice, meat, fruits, and vegetables, because i have a long day ahead of me as a working student here in the philippines.", "OP I have no eating disorder other than the usual girl who grew up in the 90s/early 2000s with everyone commenting on \"bad\" food and \"good\" food and kate moss being considered a normal weight etc.... and if someone was staring at me telling me how to eat I would rather starve for 3 months than do it tbh  \n\n\nI'm glad your grandma is on your side, you are NTA  sweetheart. I think your best bet is to talk to your grandma and then together with her to your therapist for a strategy to deal with your parents. It can be hard when parents are so fkn hardheaded, speaking from experience. It takes world war 3 to get basic ideas through to them sometimes", "No, she shouldn't be doing that but you should also be eating something at every single meal of the day, even if you don't feel like it. Maybe if you can show your mom you will commit to eating some of everything, say at least 5 bites of each thing she cooks at every meal 3 times a day, then she won't feel the need to police you so hard because she will be more confident that you can police yourself. \n\nYou seem to trying to work with it  by getting enough when you feel like eating, instead of working towards being able to eat even when you don't feel like it. You're sort of working with your disorder instead of working against it.\n\nIf you actually can't manage to eat at least 5 bites of each dish at 3 meals a day, then your eating disorder is much much much more severe than you think it is!"]}
