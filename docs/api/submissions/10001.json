It will be difficult for her and her fiance to have children, so the fact that they are pregnant is kind of a miracle.

Your concern for the conditions your sister would raise a child in are valid. It sounds like she is a hoarder as well.", "NTA.  You have real feelings and normally I would say fake being happy if you can't feel it. \n\nI grew up in a somewhat gross house with intermittent heat, electricity, phone, and with parents afraid of cps.  If my sister or brother were having a child in a home that reminded me of my childhood home I would cry.  Hopefully not in front of them.  \n\nBut I am hoping and assuming you managed at least a congrats in a neutral tone and didn't lecture her?", "NTA. I've been in very similar situations where I just can't muster happiness because I think it's a terrible idea. I feel for you.", "NTA.\n\nI don\u2019t think you are the asshole for having your own emotions and reactions. You are not obligated to feel happy for someone else\u2019s decision, especially if you have concerns about their well-being and environment. However, I also understand that your sister may have felt hurt by your lack of enthusiasm, since she probably values your opinion and support. Maybe you could try to reach out to her and explain your feelings in a respectful and compassionate way, and also acknowledge her feelings and wishes. You don\u2019t have to agree with her, but you can still show her that you care about her and her fiance.", "NTA I feel sorry for everyone involved in this, especially the baby. Maybe as her sibling, you can suggest therapy so she doesn\u2019t pass the hoarding legacy onto her future child. It\u2019s a very hard thing to talk about but worth trying.", "You might consider putting DCF on speed dial. If they live in their filth now, I doubt they\u2019ll turn a new leaf for their baby. That\u2019ll be even more overwhelmed.  NTA", "NTA you\u2019re entitled to your feelings. The child is not going to be coming into a healthy place mentally or physically.", "Info: Have you told your sister you're happy for her or that you don't think they're fit to raise a child?", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t have any obligation to fake a feeling for your sister\u2014just be as supportive as you can reasonably muster. I wouldn\u2019t go as far as TELLING your sister about your reservations\u2014there\u2019s not any upside to doing that. But just feeling apprehensive is perfectly ok, even if your sister can sense it.", "NTA, but they need help. You aren\u2019t the one to help them most likely. Assuming they don\u2019t have money for a cleaner to come in, someone (you) will have to call CPS the day that baby is born and tell them the situation. CPS is not always in the business of removing newborns. \n\nHopefully they\u2019ll qualify for home health aid and someone will go to the home X number of hours a week to clean and see that they are successively caring for the baby. \n\nI can only speak for the US, particularly the western half of the United States.", "NTA - even in the best circumstances it\u2019s not being an asshole to be honest. People love to tell autistic people the opposite but it just is t true.", "NTA. If your sister were capable of giving this child what they deserve, I would hope you\u2019d be happy for her.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t a happy occasion. It\u2019s history repeating itself and it\u2019s natural to be afraid and sad about it.", "NTA - i think u have valid concerns which im sure is what your sister felt from u.  perhaps getting together with your sister in person and offer your support in such that maybe helping pay for a housekeeper that way the home when baby arrives its clean or at least cleaner than in past.  just say its a gift or something.  also for her to continue therapy too.", "Info: What happened in the actual conflict - what did you say about the pregnancy and how did you react? What did she say in response?", "NTA - also sometimes people do change their habits when they have a kid. Like I can personally put up with quite a lot of mess (not dirty mess like plates etc), but once I had a kid I got a lot tidier. I think it\u2019s different to put up with mess when it\u2019s just you and your partner, you both know what you\u2019re like so why put too much effort into that. But once you need to set a good example, make sure the place is safe etc. It can change you, so hopefully they go on that direction.", "NTA,\n\nReacting spontaneously and cheerfull on an unexpected message isn't always for someone on the spectrum.\n\nAd to that the situation the kid is born in and you get a response that's too weak.", "(As a disclaimer, I was a parentified eldest, so I feel you. Also, everything below is colored by my own experiences, but I hope it could be useful for you too!)\n\nYour reaction makes complete sense, especially since you were thrust into a parent role at such an early age. Your reaction of practical concern is entirely warranted. \n\nAssuming that you don\u2019t want to fake happiness, and she decides to carry to term, you may be able to find a good middle ground by voicing the fact that you support her and love her. \n\nThat way, you don\u2019t have to apologize for your (entirely valid) concerns, since you\u2019ve already voiced them, she knows where you stand. \n\nSo maybe reassuring her that you still support *her* would be helpful?\n\nAlso, I\u2019d recommend looking into human service resources for first time parents. There are great programs that are designed especially for these situations - to reach out to pregnant ppl who may be ill equipped to parent, and teaching them what they need to know to do a good job. \n\n(Or, in this case, to learn and practice basic hygiene.)\n\nThis is a tough situation and you\u2019re doing your best, so I\u2019d also encourage you to give yourself grace and credit for that. As a fellow parentified-eldest, it\u2019s *so* easy to drown in guilt when your younger siblings suffer, but in cases like this it\u2019s not your fault, even a little bit. \n\nThe best thing you can do is nurture yourself be there for yourself, and be kind to yourself as you work through your own feelings of distress about the situation. \n\nThis is such a tough and shitty situation, so I just wanna validate that. NTA ofc, and I hope you\u2019re able to find some peace for yourself in the midst of this distressing time!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I paid for her to start going to therapy, and she took over payments, but I don't know if she is still going :/ The more she talks about her \"progress\" or things her therapist says, the less I feel like she's actually going.

I want so badly for this to be a good thing for them, and I'm probably projecting too much of my past experiences into their situation.\n\nI'll sit with that and think about the best way to talk with them, thank you so much for your kind and thoughtful response :)", "I paid for her to go there therapy for 6 months before she got a job and took over payments, but I don't know if she's still going, unfortunately :(", "That's my fear, too. They are also humans deserving of a clean and healthy living space, so if they can't do that for themselves, how in tf is a baby going to make it better?", "I'm afraid of that, and I'm also not in a place where I could raise a smol human (hence why I have none). I also wouldn't trust anyone in our family to step in (yay for white trash BS), so I can't see a non-tumultuous future for my nibling. And that makes me so sad :(", "I really appreciate this question. I did tell her that I am happy for her.

And I waited for her to say anything, but she just sent me a picture of her two pregnancy tests, and then waited for me to say something. It was so incredibly awkward, and felt like an ambush (but I think that was my 'tism showing, tbh). I said, \"Oh wow! I thought you weren't going to be able to be pregnant without some therapies/IVF?\" And she said, \"Yeah! But I guess it's okay!\"\n\nShe had approached me about helping them with IVF treatments (about 12k where we live) and I said that maybe she should consider the possibility that if she can't afford IVF treatments, she might not be able to afford a kiddo.\n\nYou can imagine how well that went over, and I blamed myself for saying it/being an ass", "Thank you for commenting, I appreciate your perspective \ud83d\ude0a I feel like I am kind of doom and gloom because my parents didn't shape up when we were born, but I also acknowledge it's not fair to say that no one does.

I don't want to write her off as already having failed, because I don't know that to be the case.
