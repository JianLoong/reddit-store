{"id": 33367, "submission_id": "18m8f1q", "title": "AITA for not buying christmas presents for my nephew?", "selftext": "I have two children (21m & 18f), my younger brother has two children (25f & 22m), and my older brother has three children (30m, 26f & 6m). This is about my older brother, 'Jake', and his youngest son 'Timmy'.\n\nWhen our children were growing up, my brothers and I had an agreement that we'd buy each of our nephews/nieces Christmas presents until they were 18. There was never an expectation to spend a certain amount of money, just to have something for them to unwrap. However, when Jake's daughter turned 18 and we started sending him 'family' presents instead of individual presents for each of them, he stopped sending presents for our children too, despite our prior agreement. We argued about this a few times considering we spent more years buying for his children than he did ours, but eventually we just settled that we were on 'Christmas card' terms and did not expect presents from him, nor did we send any.\n\nMy younger brother and I still send each other 'family' presents every year - like a big box of chocolates or something - and when Jake found out about this, he was furious. He thought that we just 'didn't do gifts anymore' but since we do, he feels entitled to 6yrs of gifts on Timmy's behalf. I said that that was ridiculous because he was the one that broke the agreement, his older children got 18yrs of presents from me while my children were 12 and 10 the last time they received something from him.\n\nUnfortunately, this came to a head at my aunt's wake, where Jake and his partner confronted me and my wife demanding to know why I didn't care enough to send Timmy Christmas presents like I had his older children (his partner, who is not his older children's mother, was very prickly about this) I explained it was not that I had anything against the boy personally, but with his older children we had had an agreement to send presents to each other's children, and he had broken said agreement when his daughter aged out of it, and I saw no reason why I should be obliged to spend money on his son when he had not done so for my children. He gave me a plethora of excuses and said that it was unfair to 'punish' his son for his mistake. He demanded I buy Timmy something to 'make up' for lost time. I asked if he was going to make up for the many years my children missed out too, but he just called me an asshole.\n\nMy wife, my younger brother and his wife are obviously on my side, but a couple of family members have mentioned that they do think it unfair I am 'punishing' Timmy for his father's actions and that Jake is not in the financial position he was when his other children were growing up, so he already worries Timmy's holidays are inadequate compared to the photos of his previous Christmases when his older children were young. I genuinely do not dislike my nephew - I hardly know him in all honesty - and while I do not think I am entirely in the wrong here, I do think I might be being too stubborn.

It's something you're supposed to do because you love someone, not out of obligation.", "gifts are a choice not a demand .. timmy gets santa", "ESH. Gifts shouldn't be transactional. Nobody should have agreed to doing this.", "ESH - this is all ridiculous and I agree you \u201cmaking up\u201d for gifts is silly. However, you did break the agreement first - you stopped sending individual gifts when the oldest turned 18 and I don\u2019t think that was the agreement.", "Are we obligated to buy anyone presents? Geez. He broke the agreement and now wants what?

When he sends your kids gifts you can send his son gifts. That\u2019s perfectly reasonable.", "The only way this would be fair would be if Jake sent 6 years worth of gift to your son and 8 years worth of gift to your daughter. Then and only then would it be fair to send gifts to Timmy, following the letter and spirit of your agreement before he broke it.\n\nHe made the decision to break the agreement when it no longer benefitted his children. He doesn't get to jump back on it as if nothing ever changed.

Jeez. Who asked Jake to have a third kid he had no means for?\n\nNTA.", "NTA. My opinion is probably coloured by the fact that my family does not do aunt/uncle niece/nephew gifts so to me it\u2019s not like Timmy is getting punished. If you use this argument were your children being punished from ages 10 and 12 onwards? No, they just stopped getting presents from one person. And his original assumption was correct, you don\u2019t do individual presents anymore. \n\nBut also even if there are any arguments about equality amongst nieces/nephews well then the easiest thing is to say it was just different when everyone had young kids. But also of course the differently aged kid is going to have a different experience. My grandparents are getting older so this year everyone gets gift cards. I got 25yrs of actual presents and my youngest cousin only got 11yrs, but that\u2019s just cause not everyone has the same life.", "Nta see when people don't accept ormliste  to your valid explanation the right way to further address this is to start telling them to F off", "NTA. Like you said, he broke the agreement. If he had had financial issues and explained it would be one thing. He just stopped doing it because he already had what he wanted. Also, tell SIL to mind her business. This isn\u2019t about you being petty it\u2019s about you not allowing someone to disrespect you and your kids.", "ESH, just buy Timmy something that costs \u00a35 and get on with it. You\u2019re technically right but it\u2019s not worth the argument.", "YTA - this can be summed up with \u201cI only gift gifts if I am assured I will get one in return\u201d\n\nWhat a strange and miserly approach to the holidays and gift giving", "ESH as it didn\u2019t need to get to this point and you both need to grow up. Just all agree to not do presents and be done with it.", "NTA.\n\nHe\u2019s very selfish, and it\u2019s unfortunate that his kid gets the short end of the stick, but life isn\u2019t fair. Just how your kids had to learn that lesson when their uncle stopped sending them presents as kids. At least with Timmi, he doesn\u2019t know any better, since he\u2019s never gotten a gift. \n\nAnd shame on your brother for bringing this up at a wake.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like the person who broke the agreement was you when you chose to send a \"family gift\" instead of one to the younger child when his sister turned 18. Would you have expected your youngest child to be cut off from gift giving when her brother turned 18? That said, your brother demanding what amounts to backdated gifts is absurd.", "NTA He\u2019s the one who decided him and his family weren\u2019t going to participate in gift giving.", "ESH \nno one is giving with a generous heart. Everyone is asking\u201d what is in it for me.\u201d", "NTA as it was an agreement that he broke. That being said, I would have said that the little guy shouldn\u2019t have to pay for his dad\u2019s faults; until he decided to demand that you do. I usually will always side with the child but I would rather be \u201cdipped in dog doo\u201d than bow down to his flipping demands. Maybe for his birthday or next Christmas but no way this year.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA. He broke your agreement. \n\nINFO: are you sending Timmy a Christmas card or anything? It might be nice to send him a little something just so he feels included. Obviously not an obligation, but I do think it\u2019s a good thing to do since he\u2019s so young.", "NTA funny how he\u2019s mad you didn\u2019t give his kid anything for years, but he didn\u2019t give yours anything either and gets mad when that\u2019s pointed out.", "NTA I get the argument that gifts are not transactional\u2026 but he made it that way first so you are basically just using his own game against him. His son stopped receiving them so they stopped so you did tit for tat. If you must start the family gift again!", ">He gave me a plethora of excuses and said that it was unfair to 'punish' his son for his mistake.\n\nI'm curious about this. What were his reasons? Did they not have the money? Was it something else?", "Gifts should not be transactional but they should be reciprocated which Jake chose not to do, to the detriment of his son.", "It was not when his oldest turned 18, it was when his daughter (middle child) turned 18. Youngest was not born at the time, oldest had been part of the 'family' gift since he was 18.", "If only the world was so butterflies and rainbows. \nIt's not about getting a gift. It's about how much u care for a person.", "It's not about me getting something in return, it's about my children. My daughter missed 8yrs of presents from my brother, and my son 6, so I think it's unfair he's now asking for me to buy for his son when he wouldn't do the same for my kids", "Why can't the two siblings who've never stopped giving gifts to each other continue their gift giving?", "Yeah, i missed that originally but oml bringing this up at a wake is ridiculous! Brother is an ass just for that", "The youngest child was not born until she was 20, he was not a factor at the time", "um\u2026 when the 26yo daughter was 18 timmy would have been -2. hard to send a gift when the sperm cells hadn\u2019t even been formed yet.", "No, when the daughter was over the age of 18, she no longer got an individual gift.  That was the agreement, until 18 years old.\n\nThey then sent a gift for the entire family.\n\nThat daughter was 20 when half brother was born. \n\nBrother said no to family gifts. Brother stopped sending the under 18 year olds gifts, as agreed upon.\n\nBrother broke the agreement", "Can you do math?? The younger kid wasn't born when his half sister turned 18. 26-6 = 20. It was the brother who stopped sending gifts afterwards. He was the one who broke the tradition", "We do send presents for his birthdays, it is just Christmas that we do not", "Timmy can't miss what he never had...", "I send them a card every year addressed to all three of them, but not one just for him", "He gave a few excuses, money was one of them, as was him 'losing his address book' when he moved house (but he still send us a card), him apparently forgetting how old my children were, him being abroad for Christmas (he does ski most years but he still sent presents in the years before his daughter turned 18), and how stressed he was because of his divorce (which was when his daughter was 14 and years before he stopped sending us gifts). All of these excuses were given to me a few days ago, when my other brother and i asked him about it at the time he just said not to worry and he'd give our children something next year. After a few 'next years' we gave up.", "That\u2019s fine, I mean OP and the brother he\u2019s bickering with", "And what about the middle child who was only 3 years younger?", "Well I definitely wouldn\u2019t this year for Christmas due to his father\u2019s demands.

It might be nice to get him a small gift anyways, just because he\u2019s so young and his siblings did get gifts when they were his age, but it\u2019s not an obligation", "So, a lot of BS, basically. You're definitely NTA.\n\nI would just add that your relationship with your nephew is its own thing, separate from your relationship with your brother. That's not to say that you have to get Timmy anything for Christmas, of course.", "That was the agreement after older brother backed out. But now that same person is demanding 6 years of presents even though he himself owes one 8 years of presents and the other 6.", "OP says when Jake's daughter (the middle child) turned 18, they stopped giving gifts, not when the oldest did."]}
