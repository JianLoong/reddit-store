This is about my older brother, 'Jake', and his youngest son 'Timmy'.\n\nWhen our children were growing up, my brothers and I had an agreement that we'd buy each of our nephews/nieces Christmas presents until they were 18. There was never an expectation to spend a certain amount of money, just to have something for them to unwrap. However, when Jake's daughter turned 18 and we started sending him 'family' presents instead of individual presents for each of them, he stopped sending presents for our children too, despite our prior agreement. We argued about this a few times considering we spent more years buying for his children than he did ours, but eventually we just settled that we were on 'Christmas card' terms and did not expect presents from him, nor did we send any.\n\nMy younger brother and I still send each other 'family' presents every year - like a big box of chocolates or something - and when Jake found out about this, he was furious. He thought that we just 'didn't do gifts anymore' but since we do, he feels entitled to 6yrs of gifts on Timmy's behalf. I said that that was ridiculous because he was the one that broke the agreement, his older children got 18yrs of presents from me while my children were 12 and 10 the last time they received something from him.\n\nUnfortunately, this came to a head at my aunt's wake, where Jake and his partner confronted me and my wife demanding to know why I didn't care enough to send Timmy Christmas presents like I had his older children (his partner, who is not his older children's mother, was very prickly about this) I explained it was not that I had anything against the boy personally, but with his older children we had had an agreement to send presents to each other's children, and he had broken said agreement when his daughter aged out of it, and I saw no reason why I should be obliged to spend money on his son when he had not done so for my children. He gave me a plethora of excuses and said that it was unfair to 'punish' his son for his mistake. He demanded I buy Timmy something to 'make up' for lost time. I asked if he was going to make up for the many years my children missed out too, but he just called me an asshole.\n\nMy wife, my younger brother and his wife are obviously on my side, but a couple of family members have mentioned that they do think it unfair I am 'punishing' Timmy for his father's actions and that Jake is not in the financial position he was when his other children were growing up, so he already worries Timmy's holidays are inadequate compared to the photos of his previous Christmases when his older children were young. I genuinely do not dislike my nephew - I hardly know him in all honesty - and while I do not think I am entirely in the wrong here, I do think I might be being too stubborn.

Jake will try to demand more stuff for his kid, guilting you into getting the kid swimming lessons, a bicycle, chipping in for his holidays/trips away, to help Jake raise Timmy in the standard Jake could afford for his older kids. That isn't your responsibility. If you are open to forming a relationship with Timmy, you could always offer to take Timmy on museum/theatre/sports trips that Jake can't afford, of course only taking Timmy and neither of his parents (after all, they can't afford it). That way you could bond with Timmy and give him some experiences he may otherwise not get. But I didn't get many trips away, never went skiing, we hardly ever went out to a restaurant and my parents never took me to theatre, and I turned out alright.

Then, he and his wife both had a salary, now his current partner is a SAHM so they have less money coming in - but still more than enough to live on. My parents also passed away a few years ago, while when our children were Timmy's age they were also spending money on spoiling the grandkids. \n\nWe were also shocked he brought it up at the wake.", "Yeah, it was very uncomfortable. My wife and I were talking to another relative at the time when Jake and his wife - who had clearly had a bit to drink - interrupted our conversation to demand I buy his son christmas presents", "^^^^this. They all suck.", "We don't come from a family where uncle/aunt-nibling gift-giving is the norm, our parents' siblings just sent us cards and our cousins have never expected gifts from us. We were all excited when we were first having children and wanted to spoil them. The agreement came in so no one felt obliged as the children became adults and would likely want more expensive things. It meant when the children were young, the holidays were child-orientated, and as they grew older it was more family-orientated.", "He has not apologised but he did use the word 'mistake' which is the closest he has gotten to apologising. \n\nI did for a year or two, but he was only sending us cards at that point so we gave up. he does not seem interested in sending anything to me or my other brother, just in receiving. \n\nHe confronted me at the wake, my wife and I were also shocked by it and eager to end the conversation asap.", "She did that with her other brother when his youngest turned 18. Her older brother stopped sending her kids stuff when his daughter was 14", "I don't know what Timmy knows. Our children were not told about it until they were 18, but I do not know what he has told him. Neither Jake nor his partner mentioned if Timmy was upset or how he felt so I don't know", "His current partner is a SAHM while his ex-wife also worked, so they had two salaries coming in. Our children also used to be spoiled with presents from my parents, who are no longer with us to buy for Timmy. He has a well-paying job and they can still afford to live comfortably, but it is less than it was when his other children were younger.", "And of course back pay gifts is totally unreasonable. Sorry, your brother kind of sucks.", "No. Neither of us have sent him Christmas presents since Jake stopped sending gifts to our children before he was born", "Yes, we don't spend christmases together nor open gifts together, and I doubt he'd know about it, our children didn't until they were 18.", "It was supposed to make things easier originally. We didn't come from a background of aunt/uncle -nibling gifting, our aunts and uncles just sent our family a card growing up, but when we were all having children it was exciting and we wanted to spoil them. As they got older, we agreed to keep things child-orientated when they were young, but that no one should feel obliged once they turned 18 - they generally stopped coming to christmas around 15/16 and family christmases stopped after my father died when my kids were 16 and 14 anyway. Problems only arose when Jake stopped participating in gifts at all after his older two turned 18.\n\nIt was never deliberately 'equal', the older kids would most likely get more expensive gifts than the younger children, sometimes the younger kids would have more than the older children because their gifts were cheaper, but it was an agreement that stopped people from feeling obliged once everyone was an adult.", "I don't know about his brother but his sister definitely buys him toys. I don't know how aware he is of the situation, but we've never spent Christmas with him so it is not as if he is watching everyone else with presents he doesn't have", "I think, everybody agrees on this front about the disrespect, and general shittyness of Jake. However, at the end of the line, there is still a kid who could have a slightly better Christmas, and the only thing stopping that is a petty dispute between uncle and dad. The problem is the innocents that are getting harmed. OP can give Timmy a gift and still insist his brother is indebted to his children for 3 and 6 years of gifts.", "I'm sorry I brought on a bad kicking rocks memory \n\nHope your little toe is good as new now \ud83d\ude0a", "So, the kid literally has no precedent of getting anything from you for Christmas. It\u2019s not like you stopped giving the kid presents suddenly and now he\u2019s sad.", "My sister did this. Her kids were older and she simply stopped giving mine anything when hers got past 18. Oh well.\n\nYou definitely should stick to the rules he chose. No more Xmas presents. Tell him to use the money he saved on your kids to buy an extra gift...", "NTA Tell the relatives who agree with him to send Timmy gifts if they are so set on it.", "NTA.  Your brother is really classy for bringing this up ar a wake. /s.  You did nothing wrong, he can make it up to Timmy, and/or the family members giving you a hard time can.", "Your counter request was fair, send the back pay or STFU\n\nNTA", "Then you are good! Don't worry about the rest. If you are giving him stuff for his birthday, that's plenty, especially if you aren't even that close.", "Do not bend on this.  Send the gifts only when he gets gifts for your kids", "Hold your ground ! He seems to like to break the rules when it benefits him and saves money that way. And now wants money from you now that his kid is still young. He wants to win all around.", "NTA! but if you do birthday maybe you could keep spending the same amount of money in the year but just have a birthday and Christmas gift. I'm a little confused that you give a birthday gift but Christmas is cancelled. Did your brother send birthday gifts for your kids?", "Fluffie. Stuffiez.", "This \ud83d\udcaf", "Facts", "So international ski trips but too poor for an Amazon gift card for his nieces and nephews. Brother sounds pretty self absorbed", "He goes skiing but can\u2019t afford gifts for your kids while demanding gifts for his kids? Oh please \ud83d\ude44 I wouldn\u2019t argue with him, I\u2019d just roll my eyes and walk away", "Aren\u2019t international skiing trips expensive? If big bro\u2019s strapped for cash for Timmy\u2019s Christmas maybe tell Dad to cut back on skiing abroad to give his youngest a more fitting Christmas. NTA by the way", "Yeah so that's all BS. He's just stingy and was only willing to gift your kids things for as long as his kids would still get things despite you having gifted to his kids for longer than he was willing to gift to yours. That's a cheap person if I ever saw one. I wouldn't give this person ANYTHING, ever. Sorry for Timmy his dad is an ahole. Is the new wife decades younger?", "NTA. Your brother is the AH. He's the one who stopped giving gifts. This isn't about punishing a 6 year old, and it's absolutely wild to demand 6 years of gifts like it's owed.\n\nThis is kind of similar to something that happened in my family. I was around 11 and my brothers were around 7 and 5 (twins) at the time. Our youngest aunt was around 16. Our older aunt (around 33 or 34 at the time) wanted to switch to that awful white elephant game instead of traditional presents. My parents said that us kids shouldn't be included until we were 18, including our other aunt who was also still a minor. They stated that it wasn't a fair arrangement since they would be supplying most of the gifts for the game, plus we were really young and easy to please. There were only 5 kids total to buy for counting my younger aunt, and 7 adults.\n\nMy older aunt had an absolute meltdown from just the suggestion that it wasn't fair and started screaming and cussing my parents out saying that it's \"not her fault that they had so many fucking kids.\" My dad told her it was fucked up that she didn't want to do something small for her niece and nephews. My nana sided with my older aunt just because she didn't like my dad. My younger aunt got upset about the fighting and ran out into the snow without a coat or shoes and my parents took us to go find her. \n\nChristmas was always a miserable event from then on and they never bought us a gift again for any occasion. The gifts passed in their white elephant game weren't always child appropriate either, and my aunt and her husband (*the* creepy uncle of my family) would whine if they didn't like what they got. My nana had her own meltdown when she got a fruitcake two years in a row. How hard would it have been to grab a Matchbox Car or something for kids who were too young to even have an allowance? Now my younger aunt has a 5 year old of her own and my absolute witch of an (unemployed) older aunt spends a lot of money on gifts for her to try to buy her love.\n\nMy nana died this year and this ancient Christmas fight got brought up again in the aftermath because my aunt is doing her damnedest to make sure she gets more money than anyone else. She insists we were all 18 at the time. While I'm sad about my nana, I am so so so relieved that we don't have to do Christmas over there this year. Last year, my creepy uncle was so drunk that he was making jokes about throwing dollar bills at my 5 year old cousin while she was standing on a table to show off her new princess cape. Just gross, miserable, and awkward every year for the last 25 years. I am officially no contact with my aunt and creepy uncle.", "Excuse me, he goes to *ski* most years?  Abroad?  And he's claiming to be too poor for a few Christmas gifts?  Nah.", "Smart wife. NTA", "Since that's my take on it, I have to say she nailed it.  Especially since he doesn't want to \"make up\" the gifts he didn't give your kids.", "Thanks for the reply. This reminds me of some situations from my own life. It sounds like he \u201cgot his bag\u201d and then couldn\u2019t be bothered to do the same for anyone else. What makes it worse was that, as you said, no one was expecting big money to be spent. \n\nIf you really want to play hardball, you could show him this post and point out how disrespectful he\u2019s been to you and your kids. That\u2019s what this is really about, not so much the gifts-it\u2019s the callousness. Tell him when he gives the years of presents back you\u2019ll start giving gifts again.", "Oh, I hadn't realised that. So you both had kids under 18 last year but he was silent on poor Timmy's lack of gifts?", "Agreed, but I\u2019d argue his wife is worse when she\u2019s been told the reasons why and yet she still keeps going.", "Ah, well you've done nothing wrong by reciprocating the cancelation of kid's gifts he started and you are 100% correct that if there was a choice to reignite the tradition he owes more in \"back payments\" than you.\n\nMan I'm glad my family is small, my stepsister having two kids I need to think of presents for is already annoying my lazy, insensitive, holiday cheer deficient ass.", "I always viewed gift giving as the givers choice. There was no agreement with my sister she just started sending presents when she got married. she is only 8 years older than my oldest so they sorta grew up together ad my parents babysat my children. Honestly he had a very tough time calling her Aunt until my younger son was born when he was 6. She feels like her girls are taking advantage of me, none of them ask for anything ever, and I feel like me having 7 grandkids and her buying for them without being asked to is taking advantage of her.  BUT since all my grands love her cookies and cakes and fudge (that's what they get their favorite of each) I'm not going to stop her. Shoot I want her baked goods too but alas she doesn't make any for her dear older sister LOL!", "Right. Then Jake wanted you to start again with Timmy but he had already stopped with your kids, who younger than 18. Why did he stop? Did he say?\n\nAlso, did he stop sending gifts to your other brother's kid? The youngest would have been under 18 when his youngest turned 18.", "Broke is relative- it doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re poverty level or even close but demanding 6 years of presents when he \u201ctechnically\u201d owes you 8 years is very much broke behavior \n\nHopefully it doesn\u2019t damage your relationship too much because this is all ..just wow \ud83d\ude05 I\u2019m so sorry\n\nETA: I assume the 6yo is from a different partner- could this all stem from his \u201cnew\u201d family not being treated the same as the older 2 children? Could be from left field but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there was something like that", "Timmy has older siblings to buy him gifts, he is not going to go without.", "Exactly, that\u2019s why I think OP is the asshole.", "Well as long as he is happy, included during family stuff/traditions and still gets gifts and candy and whatnot I\u2019d say NTA. I haven\u2019t ever heard of such an arrangement so I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t give much advice.", "Ok, well if it was something like medical emergency I would understand. Now he has 2 grown kids, so possibly they can pick up the slack for little bro. Not your problem", "Sounds like it has not made things easier, and has in fact driven your family apart.", "Incredible how audacious your brother and SIL are. NTA", "100% agree", "I would, I\u2019d go to the dollar store and buy $10 worth of the most annoying and messy stuff possible. You know the noisy, messy stuff kids love and parents hate?\n\nThen again I\u2019m petty.", ">\u2019s demands. NTA.\n\nYou're still punishing the kid for the actions of the father and actions from right around, if not before his birth.\n\nYou can send the kid a gift because you feel its the right thing to do even if his father is demanding yo usend a gift. Everyone is so interested in Jake losing they are forgetting Timmy could catch a win. Also, Its really easy to say to Jake as an adult, \"I didn't send him a gift because you demanded it. I sent it because the kid shouldn't be punished because You are an immature child.\"\n\nI will not be sending him 67 years of gifts as far as I am concerned you still owe my children a total of 11 years of gifts.", "You'd determine whether you want to buy a present for a kindergartener based on something his dad said to you? It's not like Timmy has any clue what's going on, much less any ability to control his dad.", "yes, my other brother and I have never bought him christmas presents", "I was an aunt at 7. By 15 I was expected to participate in the name draw for \"the kids.\" I played along until one year I drew a name for a college freshman. I let them know I wasn't participating anymore and stopped going to the Christmas get together. \n\nNow that I'm the only one with little kids they feel guilty and want to give my kids gifts. Nope. Christmas is with my husband's family and unmarked gifts that are shipped to us are dropped off at my mother's house unopened.

My other brother and I thought while he was still sending our children birthday cards, we'd still send cards and little gifts to Timmy, but his involvement in our christmas gift exchanges ended when his daughter turned 18, so we haven't sent his family anything either.", "that is what he tried to tell me, yes. You can probably guess why my wife and I didn't buy it", "I'm petty and I like children, so I'd probably gift Timmy the most obnoxious things that kids enjoy. Drums, kazoos, water guns, a cheap version of a nerf gun, clothing safe markers, etc.", "He's not broke by any means, just not in the financial position he was previously. His partner is a SAHM while he and his ex-wife had two salaries, so there was more to spend on spoiling the children, but he still makes more than enough to live comfortably on.", "Why is brother not the asshole for also not giving gifts AND being the first one one to stop?", "Slime and glitter", "Silly String.", "GLITTER!
