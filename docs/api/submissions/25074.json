Usually the uptick in price for goods is worth it due to something like convenience to purchasers as no need to find it themself.", "To be fair it's basically what any business does, minus the extra shipping and storing at store location/warehouse. A lot of our suppliers ships directly from other stores/wholesalers to us - it's just simpler to have few contacts for RMA and to pay invoices to. \n\nBut also \"drop shipping\" is often alternative name to scalpers since it sounds more official.", "Let\u2019s talk about what he\u2019s done to become your number one??\n\n(nta)", "It\u2019s not shaming to point out his business isn\u2019t necessarily gonna make him a multi-millionaire like the woman he was trying to put down.", "Starting a small business is one thing, being a pompous asshat is something different.", "Hmmm..", "He can be as proud of his own achievements as anything. But tearing other people down doesn't raise him up; it just makes him look like a judgemental AH.", "Not sure if he should be proud of being able to follow a couple of tutorials on youtube and making a website on amazon. Now if he had built a business from scratch, that would be something celebrate.", "Lots of people who pay rent don\u2019t deserve respect. Putting up with their attitude is usually price enough.", "Also drop shopping has a very short lifetime. If he gets his rocks off over 4K a month that\u2019s comical.", "Also I just want to say - that dude that shat on my skills (same industry) and was so arrogant about his skills ... yeah ran into him 2 years later and I was the hot shot on the high pay, and he was the lacky.   \n\n\nSwings and roundabouts. Fuck I enjoyed every second of telling that dude what to do because he didnt know how.", "Him watching you tube 'business videos' and being a self-described alpha male had me zoning in on Andrew Tate and his acolytes", "What's the betting that it's $4000 pcm turnover, not profit", "Bad bot stealing comments!", "There are some big companies like wayfair (and even amazon to some extent) that do it. I think they can get away with it due to the sheer volume of stock and the added convenience of being able to search for everything in one place. \n\nEven then its still very easy to find an item you want and reverse image search to find the suppliers website and order direct.\n\nI can't see it being a sustainable business for a smaller retailer.\n\nIt seems like one of those get rich quick schemes. Might work for a while but not sustainable. \n\nAlso $3000-4000 a month isn't a lot (at least in terms on US salaries). I take home \u00a32300 (after tax and pension etc) which is pretty much $3000 and im on an OK salary for the UK. Salaries are much higher in the US. Not to mention being self employed he's not getting paid time off, sick days, employer pension contributions and since its the US his health care too.\n\nWhen you think about it he's actually not that much. Surely a graduate salary will be more", "I bet he's lying about his income, these drop ship internet business gurus all make their money off telling other people to drop ship, none of them have ever done it themselves.", "Amazon will crush him if he finds a product category that\u2019s valuable enough. \n\nThat\u2019s basically all Amazon Basics is\u2026they find product categories that have high amounts of drop shipping and go right to the manufacturers, offer them massive contracts, and then undercut all these drop-shippers by being hella more efficient and having massive scale. \n\nRight now he\u2019s making $36k-$48k annually\u2026that\u2019s not a big business. Especially as drop shipping doesn\u2019t have much overhead meaning that\u2019s probably close to the revenue he makes. Dude is one Amazon listing away from bottoming out.", "Yep. \n\nI image searched a jumpsuit *yesterday*, and figured out it\u2019s most likely drop shipped trash. 10+ shops were selling it, none listed the manufacturer, most tried to claim it as their own design, none had reviews, and some even claimed it was VINTAGE(!!) \n\nIt was a cute jean jumpsuit, but $70-$95 for drop shipped trash, from some \u201cboutique\u201d that won\u2019t even give me an actual refund if I end up not liking the item? Fuck no. Especially when I could buy a better quality jean jumpsuit for the same price, and be able to return it if I don\u2019t like it.", "Nah, the amount of NTAs here is Reddit's \"the woman is always right\" mentality. If these two were my friends I would unbiasedly say ESH.", "\"Respect his work, it does pay the rent.\"\n\nHe is working to pay his expenses. He built something out of zero, and it's hard.\n\nShe should respect that, simple.", "Yes, that\u2019s where my mind went too. And of course whole \u201calpha male\u201dnothing in nature has been debunked, plus someone who has to refer to themselves in that way continually is clearly compensating for something.", "I find the people who loudly proclaim they\u2019re unbiased are the most biased. Bye!", "He created a drop ship company, it\u2019s not all that difficult and could easily be gone tomorrow.", "I was just stating my opinion. You're now being rude.", "Any company can be gone tomorrow.\n\n\"it\u2019s not all that difficult\" - In this economy, starting anything at all is not easy.\n\nDo you fell she should not respect his work?", "Yeah because it\u2019s not real work. Anyone can watch a YouTube video and open a drop ship business. He\u2019s acting like he\u2019s making 6 figures a year when he\u2019s actually making as much as person who stocks shelves. His job requires no real work and should be used as an extra source of income.", "\"it\u2019s not real work.\" - Ok, let's say she quits her job, opens an only fans and is making money.\n\nIs that a real work? Would you respect her work?", "Nope it\u2019s not real work ether. While it\u2019s money it\u2019s not a transferable skill that will be marketable in future careers.", "Eh, debatable.  Sec work is the oldest job humanity knows.  Thousands of years ago it existed and it will exist in another thousand years.  It will always be marketable."]}
