I work full time in a relatively high stressed job.\n\nEver since I was 24 I\u2019ve been on a low carb diet. It\u2019s obviously not for everybody but I feel better not consuming so much carb and sugar\u2014it helps with my weight, concentration, and energy level. My diet consists mostly of meat served with fruits and vegetables, but if I crave a slice of pizza or a helping of Pad Thai every now and then I don\u2019t beat myself over it. \n\nWhen Zoe came to live with me, I made sure to have carbs for her meals, mostly rice and potatoes. I also take us out to eat once or twice a week so we can explore different cuisines and local offerings. She has lunch at her school and I give her a small allowance so she can buy whatever she likes within that budget.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t have in my home is dessert. I used to stock some when Zoe first came live with me and would give her a small serving after her meal while I had some fruits. A few weeks of that and Zoe asked why I didn\u2019t eat any dessert with her and I told her for me fruits are yummier and healthier. Not long after she stopped me from buying more of anything sweet when I took her grocery shopping and said she would have just fruits, too, like me. I tried to serve her some dessert we had at her next meal but she refused. A few more times of that and I stopped offering and gave her fruits instead. Zoe and I still enjoy dessert when we go out to eat (knafeh is one of our favorites).\n\nA few days ago, a mom from Zoe\u2019s after school club called me. She told me she brought butterscotch pies to the club and everyone enjoyed a piece, including Zoe. A lot of kids left school early that day so there was a lot of leftover pie and she offered to pack it up for everyone there to take home. All the kids took some, but Zoe didn\u2019t and told her we don\u2019t really have dessert at home.\n\n She was concerned that I was setting Zoe up for an eating disorder and that kids deserve to have something sweet in the house. I told her how it was Zoe\u2019s choice to not have dessert, so I just stop stocking them. I also told her I know Zoe occasionally bought sweets at school, so there\u2019s no need to add more sugar content to her home food. She said it was not right for me to set a low carb diet lifestyle as an example for Zoe when she\u2019s still so young and should not be restricted from eating anything. Again, I told her that Zoe can have anything she wants and I would gladly provide any food for her, but she argued that eating is a social thing and by seeing me abstaining from sweets, Zoe would do the same to feel like she belongs. \n\nI\u2019m quite confused about this. I know from a rough nutrition estimate that Zoe is getting what she needs. She is rarely sick and her martial arts instructor says she\u2019s an active and enthusiastic student. I also don\u2019t think I should compromise my own chosen diet so my niece can have dessert at home.

But at the end of the day, your niece is healthy and getting enough food. It sounds like you do not shame her to try to get her to follow your diet, and if she asks for something she can have it. She also has access to her own money to buy a sweet if she wants. Having access to get something if wanted is huge, because it will help her not feel the need to eat every sweet because she doesn\u2019t know when she\u2019ll have another.\n\nDon\u2019t sweat it too much. You sounds like you are taking a thoughtful approach here", "NTA, and tell that woman to mind her own business. Your niece is happy and healthy, that is what matters.", "NTA- Other parents are some of the worst with judgement about how you are raising a child. Don\u2019t concern yourself with parenting advice you haven\u2019t asked for. If your niece is healthy and has a healthy view of food, then you have nothing to worry about.", ">I tried to serve her some dessert we had at her next meal but she refused.\n\nThat's all that matters really. How can you be the AH if the child gets what she wants and NEEDS? No one needs sweets. NTA\n\nIf anything I'd understood if that other mom was concernced about a low carb diet in general for a kid and her not getting a varied diet. But that's not her issue isn't it? Also: some random mom from \"after school club\" is in no position to comment on Zoe's eating behavior from that one instance and even less so if her concerns are about fucking dessert. It's super effed up to accuse someone to set up a child for an eating disorder.\n\nI really don't understand how that woman came to the conclusion to lecture you about how you feed your niece. I can only imagine she either feels entitled to an opinion cause you're not her \"real mom\" but a guardian or she herself has issues with her own kids (possibly feeding them sweets to a point she knows is unhealthy) and seeing a kid skipping dessert makes her feel bad. Either way she's definitely an AH.", "NTA. This lady is way out of line by trying to push her unhealthy diet on your kid. \n\nKids don't need sugary deserts. You are teaching her good eating habit.", "NTA. That mom was really overstepping, especially after you explained that you do not restrict Zoe from having sweets.  It sounds like you're doing a great job at making sure Zoe gets her nutritional needs and has a healthy, balanced diet that's NOT restricted. For what it's worth, i'm saying this as a person with a history of eating disorders.", "NAH\n\nSounds like you are doing your best to do right by Zoe and let her know that she can have choices that are different from yours if she wants to. That mom could have a valid concern, though, because it is such a slippery slope from thinking about restricting your diet in any way to eating disorder tendencies. \n\nFrom your description, it sounds like Zoe is making healthy and respectful choices, but it could be that her comment raised a red flag for that mom because the mom, or someone close to her, has had an eating disorder in the past or present.\n\nIt might be worth doing some reading about eating disorders, what they are, and how they take root, and make sure that you\u2019re not encouraging that kind of thinking. But, based on your description, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re doing anything bad. You are following a regime that you have set for yourself, but not requiring the kid to follow it.", "NTA, one does not need a dessert after an ordinary meal. You occasionally have dessert when you eat out which is absolutely fine. In Sweden we have \"saturday candy\" and it's exactly that, once a week you eat sweets. It's actually great with kids, you allow sweets but you have a simple rule for them. Most of all you teach them that sweets aren't an every day thing. It sounds like you have a working system and your niece still accepts sweets when she's offered so no problem at all. She just didn't see the point of bringing any home.", "NTA.\n\nFor that mom, it would take an eating disorder to make her give up sweets, so she's looking at you through that lens.\n\nYou have made a long-term dietary choice, and you let Zoe make her own choice, too. Nobody's suffering, everybody's healthy.\n\nThe only problem is that mom, and she's probably less harmful than sugar, so you still come out ahead.", "NTA - You\u2019re raising a healthier kid. And that\u2019s great. She\u2019s getting proper nutrition. Don\u2019t fall for the mama drama.", "NTA. None of the other mom\u2019s business. Just say \u201cThank you for your concern\u201d and hang up.", "NTA. You allow her sweets with balance and choice. Some people need to butt out.", "NTA just ignore that person, they are sticking their nose where it doesn't belong. Zoe is old enough to know what she does and does not want and old enough to express such things. You are doing just fine.", "NTA. Mom of twin nine year old girls here. At nine kids are very capable of making their own decisions. They are trying out identities and thinking about who they are and who they want to be. She may change her mind at some point and want desserts in the house at some point, or maybe she just enjoys eating the way you do. Either way, you\u2019re doing the right thing by respecting her choices. As long as she\u2019s not making unhealthy decisions, support her. No need to listen to busybody moms who think they know best for everyone else\u2019s kids. She likely thinks you can\u2019t mom since you are young and not birth mom, but you can mom. You\u2019re doing great. Trust yourself.", "NTA. Simply tell that woman that Zoe\u2019s eating habits are none of her business", "NTA. So what if the kid's abstaining because monkey-see, monkey-do? If she doesn't want to eat them, there's literally no downside because sweets don't really do anything good for you.", "Many cultures do not have dessert. This isn\u2019t abusive or triggering, it\u2019s just what it is. Dessert isn\u2019t an essential part of a meal and it\u2019s not an everyday thing. Zoe is making choices that are right for her. And honestly given the levels of obesity and diabetes in the US, giving a child a love of fruits instead of baked goods is actually a blessing. Next time tell her to mind her own business. \n\nNTA", "NTA but if you\u2019re truly concerned, talk to her pediatrician about what she eats.", "NTA. I'll never understand how anyone could feel entitled enough to monitor other people's dietary choices to the point of calling them and demanding changes. She seems like someone living a very boring and frustrating life if she fills her time caring that much at things that are not her business.", "NTA talk to Zoe's pediatrician not Butterscotch Pie Mom, it sounds like Zoe is fine nutrition wise. She's not being denied she just doesn't want them.", "NTA. Why would you buy something that neither of you want to satisfy a busybody?", "NTA.  That lady needs to mind her own business.  I wonder if it occurred to her that maybe she just didn't like her butterscotch and didn't want to bring any home. \n\nYou are not restricting her in any way and for her age she is displaying a great level of self moderation.  To me it sounds like you are doing a great job.", "NTA Zoe is free to eat dessert, she just chooses not to at home but does get some along with other sweets when she goes out to eat, is at a party or just craves some. She refused when you offered, are you supposed to shove pie down her throat? My family and i also never have dessert after meals, we have a cabinet with sweets and snacks for those who want one and i always had money to buy my own snacks. I never felt restricted by my parents and them not having dessert after meals was never an indication for me to have an unhealthy relationship with food. I just showed me that i had a choice and could say no.", "NTA. The mom is TA. She should have been immediately shut down. How dare she question you about choices you make concerning Zo\u00eb. There was no need to go into all the explanation you did.", "NTA. You're not making her quit eating dessert altogether, forcing her to follow your diet etc. Desserts are not the only resource of carbs, her low carb argument isn't valid. \n\nThough there is a possibility Zoe is not eating desserts at home to bond more with you, a talk can light the situation. It sounds like she is in an healthy environment, she can express herself. If she wants it's solved with a grocery shop trip. Simple. \n\nI agree that if she eats desserts/sweets at school, she probably doesn't need a second serving at home. A lot of kids are given one dessert time per day for a healthier diet.", "NTA\n\n> She was concerned that I was setting Zoe up for an eating disorder and that kids deserve to have something sweet in the house.\n\nThat's utterly ridiculous and I would have laughed in her face.\n\n> eating is a social thing and by seeing me abstaining from sweets, Zoe would do the same to feel like she belongs\n\nGood.", "NTA. You were ok with dessert she decided she was ok without it. I\u2019d say you are doing fine. Kids will adjust to a diet change over time if given the chance. She probably just thinks they (sweets)  aren\u2019t that great tasting anymore because her taste buds adapted to the change.  You are setting her up for a life of heathy eating so\ud83d\udc4d", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand the people saying n a h and that the mom had reason to inquire. She was way out of line! If Zoe had been gorging herself on butterscotch pie and saying that you never let her eat sweets, then maybe it would have made sense for the mom to check in with you. But not in this situation.", "INFO \u2014 what is the after school person\u2019s job/role?", "nta at all you didnt force the kid to eat fruit they chose too also why are obsessed with feeding their kids endess sugar and processed food are people so brainwashed that they think healthy food is bad for them", "NAH. Mom could be right about Zoe's behaviour (wanting to fit in thus rejection dessert) and her concern is understandable, but again, You shouldnt eat something you don't want either. Maybe sit down and talk things through with Zoe so she could feel more comfortable with her own desires (I feel you had already done that, but just in case, it doesnt hurt to talk about it from time to time to reassure her) Also ty for taking care of her!", "I think you\u2019re fine BUT you live in a culture where extra carbs is considered the norm. So now you look off. \n\n\nAlso your niece is entering years where her peers are likely to talk about weird diets and \u201cI\u2019m so fat\u201d and the whole peer pressure, instagram pressure for teen girls.  So essentially prime time for eating disorders. And I have friends who struggle with the after-math 20 yrs later. \n\n\nSo, right now, she\u2019s eating to \u201cfit in\u201d with you. Let\u2019s get her educated. \n\n\nI\u2019d say, have your niece (and you) find and meet with a dietician and therapist who specializes in teen girls, maybe even eating disorders, to help prevent issues for  your niece. And give her tools of what to say or do if she ends up in weird situations.  \n\n\nNTA. Good luck.", "NTA. I wish I had had someone like you in my life as a kid.", "Nta\u2026I agree you shouldn\u2019t restrict a child from food if they want it.  I have a niece who doesn\u2019t like chocolate, no eating disorder and no one tells her she can\u2019t eat it.  Maybe Zoe was being polite and didn\u2019t like it.  That sounds super sweet and has she normally doesn\u2019t eat sweet things it might have been too much for her palate.", "NAH - I won\u2019t jump at the other mother for questioning things because I think it\u2019s good that she cares about Zoe\u2019s welfare enough to have a tough conversation about this.\n\nI don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with not having sweet stuff in the house, but her reluctance to have any on occasion is a bit of a worry. Control of food is one way of managing after trauma and she\u2019s had a big trauma in losing her parents. Now not eating sweets is not going to kill you, I\u2019d be worried about her picking up on more though, I.e carbs have their place, or it extending to more severe restriction.", "NTA - fruits are a dessert.  The fact that some people now regard them as 'worthy' or part of a 'diet' shows how twisted some thinking has become.  I'd much rather have fruit (currently stewing rhubarb & going to add rasps & bluberries) \n\nI've come across the assumption that I'm 'denying myself' desserts, but I don't like very-sweet, stodgy food & cream has always made me throw up.  I think you're doing a great job of introducing her to a wide range of food.  What does concern me is when children have a limited range in their diet & won't try new things (obv intolerance/sensitivities aside)", "Not the AH but I think Zoe might be taking the no desert at home rule a little too far. \n\nShe is setting food rules for herself and she might very well be using these rules to feel in control of her environment", "NAH\n\nShe's right about the ED thing. Restriction of any kind and for any reason is one of the biggest risk factors for developing an ED or disordered eating. If she didn't want to bring home the sweet because of fear around food or because she only wants to make healthy food decisions then that's an indication that she's at risk. You should probably discuss this with a registered dietitian with ED  knowledge to be on the safe side.", "This isn't a question you should bring to randoms on the internet.\n\nDoes Zoe have a counselor? Does Zoe have a doctor? She should have both and you should be asking both. \n\nAlso, you should be talking to parenting experts about how to handle this.\n\nA young girl who has experienced so much change is definitely going to display behaviors that might mean different things than another child at that age doing it.  \n\nYou should be talking to educated professionals, not internet randoms. \n\nYTA if you don't ask a professional about this and just listen to whatever is said in this thread.\n\n**Everyone commenting seems to miss the part that Zoe lost both of her parents in the last 12 months** and is now living with her aunt, who has no parenting experience. This is a deeper issue than a long time mom in the habit of feeding her child healthy food and the kid just prefers fruit. This is a case of an orphan bonding with a new parental figure and coping with change and perhaps may be showing aberrant behavior that OP might be missing because OP is a new parent.  Any kid going through this level of stress needs a counselor for at least the first year! This is still a very fresh situation.", "~~INFO~~\n\n~~When Zoe decided she didn\u2019t want dessert anymore, why was it? Was it because she genuinely preferred fruit/ saw the benefits to it?

You have a diet that you focus on, thats going to appear healthy or OCD depending on whose opinion.\n\nTeachers are busy busy people, so if she took time to check on her student she had a legitimate concern.  Probably little more to it, than \"we dont eat dessert\".   Probably alot more.  \n\nId have to guess, but i imagine your daughter is bringing your philosophy to school with her, that clashes with the other kids.  If you are strict, it probably isolates her some from purely social interaction.

The kid ate some, and probably didn't care for it. When I was a kid butterscotch was not the favorite flavor...", "I think you\u2019re doing fine. You\u2019re not rigid about your diet or Zoe\u2019s, and she seems to be happy with eating the way you do. Kids often pick up on doing things the way adults do, and it\u2019s often a good sign that they like and respect you. (Not always, sometimes it\u2019s a fear thing, and they can certainly pick up unhealthy habits too, but usually it\u2019s positive when they pick up a healthy habit voluntarily.)\n\nMy foster kid was like that. He came to me having basically only eaten chicken nuggets, pizza, fries, stuff that could easily be put in an oven. (I\u2019m not criticising his parents for that; there are a LOT of factors that go into why people eat the way they do.) But I mostly ate fresh, from scratch, so he started to, and he got really interested in cooking, especially Chinese and Indian dishes (which I was happy about, they\u2019re a great way to get a lot of veggies in). He had adequate lunch money and money for a second breakfast on the way to school, and we either got takeout or he went out with friends one night a week, and I kept frozen pizzas and mozzarella sticks as an option for snacks and for the one night a week I had evening class (he was 14; I wasn\u2019t leaving a little kid alone). And if he wanted anything specific, he knew he could either buy it with his lunch money, or ask me to put it on the grocery list. But as time went on, he relied on that stuff less and less, and developed more of an interest in cooking and eating healthily.\n\nI don\u2019t know what Zoe\u2019s diet was like with her parents, but if it was reasonably narrow - and no shade on them if it was; eating different cuisines is important to some people and not to others then it\u2019s not surprising that her tastes are changing as she explores more. When R moved in with me, his \u201cpotential food\u201d list must have expanded twentyfold.\n\nI firmly believe that all food is good food (though some foods I will not *personally* touch!).

It is a common trigger for many auto-immune diseases.\n\nYou are teaching Zoe it is okay to NOT eat refined sugar but the occasional treat doesn't hurt anything. You are teaching her that some carbs are good & necessary for her diet as a growing human, but adults aren't growing and don't need that \"sugar\" as much.\n\nIf you are concerned about Zoe's diet, visit a dietician.

That mother was out of line for accusing you but from what I read, I don\u2019t agree with your approach to dieting with your niece. You should have encouraged her to eat sweets, letting her know that you ate sweets as a kid and children eat sweets. Adults don\u2019t have as much of a sweet tooth as children do. That is why as an adult, you are satisfied by the sweetness of fruit. But as a kid, she should be enjoying the sugary desserts because this is the time of her life for indulging on those things with virtually no consequence. Children do copy their adult role models, and you need to make an effort to teach your niece that you are both in different parts of your lives, are affected differently by foods and your bodies are craving different things. It is definitely not healthy for a 9 year old to be as diet conscious as a fully grown woman who is trying to get in or stay in shape.", "NTA.\n\nI agree. \n\nThe only thing OP should do is communicate with the niece, let her know that a parent said that it's a dessert free household. And ask if she's aware that it isn't, and she can bring in desserts and have them as she pleases. Because it's her home too.\n\nThis is just to make sure she isn't doing this because she's worried you're dessert free for diet reasons. And she doesn't want to tempt you.\n\nSometimes you have to repeat things to kids and they might make assumptions based on what they see. So have a word, ask her if it's definitely a choice or if she's doing it for you.", "Also, Zoe decided she didn't need sweets in the house. OP said they stopped keeping sweets in the house after Zoe decided to stop eating them. My wife and I don't drink milk. Except when we use it to cook. I was the only one that drank it, and it went bad before it was gone. So I just stopped. If no one in the house is using it, why keep it stocked?", "The woman doesn't see OP as Zoe's parent. Simple as that.  \nI grew up in an area where there were \"nontraditional\" family units, and usually some busybody would bother or demean the guardian of the house.

This kid has a choice and from what OP has said the kid has access to sweets if she wants them and isn't being judged for it. No other info is provided, you have absolutely no idea about their counseling or therapy. OP did not ask about that kind of advice and certainly doesn't need your holier than thou attitude.

She was offended the kid didn't want her horribly sweet dessert (never heard of or had butterscotch pie but it sounds awful) and had to find a justification was to why she was in the right.  The kid probably said, \"no, thank you\" and was immediately badgered into explaining shy she didn't want to take anything home.\n\nIt was very rude of the woman to insert herself into how OP is raising her niece and my response would have been not to even get engaged in this kind of discussion.", "Dessert is not a food group! It is a treat that one has once in awhile.", "My grandmother let us have too many sweets as kids only to turn around and always try to make comments about our bodies which severely pissed me off. For a while, I liked sweets wayy too much and had them too often at home- buying cookies and ice cream, candy it was all too much. I have definitely cut back now and have a better relationship with desserts. My mom monitored our sweets but it was out of her own insecurities which also didn\u2019t help because it was always \u201cyou don\u2019t want to be fat\u201d and not about health. It seems like OP has a good relationship with food and is doing the same with their niece.", "The topic of discussion isn't happening in a vacuum though. I thought it was weird the OP kind of glossed over Zoe's parents' death and instead talked about her own low-carb diet at length. \n\nTreating dessert as an abnormal option (note: option, not requirement) does have the potential for triggering a future eating disorder. The poor girl is already likely numb from the loss of her parents and living in a strange household with new rules. Why is the OP be so adamant about this topic?", "Yes it sounds like OP is modeling a good diet and it's super bizarre that this other mom thinks it's unhealthy.", "What is harsh about commenting that someone is a new parent?", "This is an excellent point. If Zoe felt deprived of sweets she would have pounced at the opportunity to get extra pie. Being able to recognize when you're satisfied and declining to eat more is the hallmark of successful intuitive eating. OP should have been commended for helping Zoe to learn to listen to her body's satiety signals and not overeat something just because it was available to her. This is a difficult thing for even many adults to do.", "I also was raised that way. We never had prepackaged, processed sweets in the house and were only allowed to drink soda once a week with Friday night pizza. The sweets we did occasionally have were home cooked cookies, cakes, and puddings. I truly believe that the more sugar you have the more you need to consume to get the same sweetness effect. If you don't have a lot of sweets, people don't really develop a taste for them like you didn't and it's much easier to enjoy them as a rare treat. Sweets offer zero nutritional value and over eating them contributes to many people's struggles with weight and dental issues. I really am mystified by people who think not letting kids have unlimited access to to sweets is a bad thing. Plenty of people were raised without eating sweets regularly and they turned out just fine.", "Yep. And it can also be cultural. American sweets and food have a really high sugar content.

Stop digging into anything else... you should know how this sub works already.", "What does not wanting dessert at home have to do with counselling? How do you know she isn't receiving counselling?\n\nAny child eating in their home environment will think their diet at home is normal. Whether the cupboards are chock full of sweets or not.\n\nZoe ate a slice of pie at the party, but didn't want any more & said so. Good for her, I would struggle to make such a sensible choice & I'm far older than she is.\n\nWe should all be avoiding Ultra Processed Foods, which most of the sweets and cakes available to buy are, and having pudding every night is not necessary. Sounds like Zoe & OP have a healthy relationship with sweets, good fo them.", "She is likely physically healthier from sticking to fruit.\n\nSure, this might be wanting to have a sense of 'belonging', but in this case is hopefully setting her up for a physically healthier lifestyle.  It sounds like she's got a really good balance of enjoying deserts occasionally and not feeling like they are restricted to her.\n\nThe mental health side is another matter entirely.  But having her sugar mixed in with nutrients and fibre can actually help that side too!", "This is clearly not the issue at end and talked about. And the \"zero parenting experience\" is totally judgemental. No parent have any prior parenting experience for the first child, and for the second ? They only had one. Do they go to counseling ? Do they get a diploma for being great parent or bad parent ? Nope.\n\n\nShe has as much experience with kids as the next mom on her first kid. And let's not start talking about \"professional\", kids of psy aren't stranger to psychological problem, kids of dietician also have found problem, and they all have different opinion. And so on..", "I know my parents would\u2019ve loved it if I had. Would\u2019ve made my first year so much easier on them.", "I think I got diabetes just reading that description, lol", "We love people like you who know everything! Thank you!", "we all just love people like you who specialize in making problems out of nothing", "But there's ways to get sodium into your body in healthy ways without all the fat and carbs that come along with fries and crap. Of course everyone is different but saying that potato chips, Mickey D's and sugary shit should be eaten on the regular is what's wrong with the American diet. You need salt, ok, but do you really need all the other crap that's in those products?", "OP isn't teaching her that any food is a reward, but giving a kid access to eat whatever they want all the time sets them up for failure too. Moderation is key. Food is a huge part of our social construct here in the USA. Even the idea that breakfast is the most important meal and you must eat 3 meals a day and drink milk for calcium...all social and marketing constructs pushed by the powers that be onto people who don't bother to do their own research because \"it's just accepted.\" Everyone is different. The food pyramid simply doesn't work for many yet it's looked at as the gold standard, the go to. Most doctors in this country have no nutritional know how and are only required to take 2-3 classes at most. Instead they push pills and Band-Aids vs getting to the root of issues and most dieticians start from the food pyramid. I have only had one nutritional scientist explain to me how our cells operate and how they utilitize what we put into our bodies.", "Yep!.plus I have seen kids backpacks lol...squished butterscotch pie ewww!", "Honestly, canned peaches and especially canned pears slap.", "Pickle juice has great benefits beyond just the salt.", "LOL.  I had the opposite reaction.  Although I love breakfast foods, I don't ever want breakfast.  The thought of eating first thing makes me feel all heavy and distressed.  It was the source of endless friction between my mom and me.  I was happy when it got a name and I could say I was doing intermittent fasting! Not skipping breakfast.", "That's us, too.\n\nWe have treats on Fridays but I don't keep sweets in the house per se. If my kids want candy or cookies, they can use their allowance anytime. \n\nOP, the woman is a busy body - each household conducts inself differently. You are not witholding treats or telling her not to eat them. She is emulating you because you are her safe person who loves her but she obviously feels comfortable having a treat here and there and that is how it should be.", "Same in my house sweets or dessert was a once a week treat. My daughter is the same and when the grandkids come every night is sweets dessert night. There is always lots of fruit and other snacks", "So sorry that happened to you!\n\nA lot of people don\u2019t realize that a certain amount of salt in our diet is necessary for human survival.", "The ingredients or the nutrition label?", "You are welcome.", "Since I have no desire to go into withdrawals from eliminating that from my diet and 'real' food costs about 5x more money than junk food... yes I do.", "It absolutely does. Great source of electrolytes, as well. I also need lots of electrolytes, so it's a  solution I use fairly often! It's also good for gut health, too.", "So right there, that's what I'm talking about. I'm not attacking you, my point is that all of this is a social construct. The food system in this country is fucked beyond belief. It costs less to buy shit from McDonald's that will give you more issues down the road which lines the pockets of big pharma than it does for people to eat something that will make them healthier. There are alternatives out there.", "Just be careful of added sugar. Even certain varieties of Morton's salt has added sugar it's wild.", "There are, of course. But how many people can afford them? I know someone who used to be homeless, living on food stamps. They were always preached at to eat healthier... but example... how can you when a small salad is $5.00+ and a burger is $1.00 off the value menu... and you get maybe $25-50 a week to live on? It's something I find hugely frustrating.", "That would be a great philosophy if the people on it were less evangelistic about it. I swear there's a google alert out there for \"fasting\" and if it ever gets mentioned, fifty zealots will descend upon the thread and preach The Gospel According to Fung.", "saying that a parent should ask a doctor health questions about their child? \n\nIs that really unreasonable?", "Frozen grapes are great in summer", "Don't use that key word \"exhausting\"...  someone will tell people to go NC with us!", "Fruit in Jello?  Or with whipped cream?  Only saw stuff like that at Church socials\u2014and someone else brought it. \nFancy was Jello made in a Bundt cake pan & turned out on a plate."]}
