What other stupid bullshit conspiracies do they believe in?  You should\u2019ve cut them off when they supported the fucking insurrection", "NTA. They need to educate themselves on how chemo works. \ud83e\udd26", "NTA your cousins suck. Your poor grandma I feel so bad for her. That\u2019s so heartbreaking to do. If they\u2019re real concerned I\u2019m sure there are other precautions that could be taken instead of just never coming around", "NTA. Using that as an excuse is crazy, their babies will probably be fine.", "Is this for real? NTA. Chemo has some HARSH effects on the body. It is rough, but it can\u2019t be transferred to others by proximity. You can point out if their belief was true then medical staff would have to take extensive precautions, but they don\u2019t. It\u2019s an excuse to get out of visiting. But, honestly, it is hard to see your loved one losing their battle with cancer. Some people genuinely can\u2019t handle it. I\u2019m honestly surprised that would even offer chemo at end stage. The effects are so harsh, and with terminal cancer it\u2019s strictly attempting to buy more time. If she\u2019s nearing the end I would think that they\u2019d be pushing for hospice to keep her as comfortable as possible instead of the effects of chemo that won\u2019t be as much help at the end. (My dad did 2 rounds of chemo, 1 radiation. He was diagnosed as terminal before any of it. It was hard, but I supported his choice to stop treatment. I don\u2019t regret it. It gave him a few months of feeling somewhat decent before he passed.) My thoughts are with your family. Cancer is a b!tch.", "Not a medical professional but I don't think chemo causes birth defects from being around the medication or someone else taking it. NTA. Please go see her extra to make up for your cousins.", "NTA. The irony here is that a pre-disposition to cancer is generally hereditary. They can run from the chemo all they want but they can't hide from cancer. \n\nThey suck but take this as a chance to monopolize all of your grandmother's time. You'll feel better knowing you were there for her at the end and she'll pass with the people who truly love her by her side.

I'm sorry you're going through this, and your poor grandma. Maybe you can do something special for her to take the sting our of their actions?

It\u2019s extremely painful to watch someone you love suffer, suffer with pain, and pass away.  This could be their knee jerk reaction to hearing about Grandma. \n\nAlso Grandma is still alive. She\u2019s not gone yet. She\u2019s still lucid.

She's not. \n\nAll chemo is is a bunch of medications.  Very hard core ones. Sometimes you have to be careful if you're cleaning up the person's vomit or urine or feces. I doubt they are.", "NTA.\n\nYour cousins are either confusing radiation treatments with chemo, or they're ignorant/stupid. Chemo has zero physical impact on anyone other than the person undergoing treatments.", "NTA - that\u2019s a crazy and heartless excuse they used.\n\nHonestly, your grandmother needs compassionate and supportive people around her right now.
