He travels out of the country every so often to he his girlfriend and I travel home for the holidays and very occasionally with my boyfriend. \n\nEvery time he gets a flight it\u2019s 5am and I get up to take him to the airport. I do it more so that if I ever need the favor returned I can ask him, but it\u2019s always ended up where he is already out of town when I need a ride or someone else offered. \n\nThen a month ago I needed a ride for a 8am flight to New Orleans and so I told him I\u2019d need a ride at 6am to the airport. I reminded him for days and he said okay, then the morning of I went to wake him and he said he\u2019d rather pay an Uber. I didn\u2019t want to do that because one, it was cutting it close for time and drivers can decline a ride and two, I didn\u2019t feel comfortable in a long car ride with someone by myself. \n\nI made him take me and he threw a fit the whole way (I drove us there) and when I got to New Orleans he ruined the whole day spamming me with messages about how I was an asshole for making him wake up because he had a tattoo later in the day and needed sleep (his tattoo appointment was 6 hours later). Eventually the argument came down to us agreeing to not take each other to the airport anymore. \n\nNow, my brothers going home first this year for Christmas on Saturday. He told me today that I need to take him to the airport and I told him no. He got angry at me and said that he took me to the airport for New Orleans. I reminded him that he ruined the first day of my trip and I ubered myself back. I also reminded him that I had taken him at least three times beforehand at 4am. He then had the audacity to tell me that I should pay for his Uber and I told him he\u2019s out of his mind. He says I\u2019m being an asshole when I should have just let him buy my Uber to New Orleans. \n\nAm I the asshole for not letting him just pay for an Uber and not taking him to the airport anymore? \n\nTLDR: my brother and I agreed not to take each other to the airport anymore, but is mad now because I won\u2019t take him to the airport. (It sounds stupid when I say it like this)\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t realize that I didn\u2019t write it in the post, but of course I reminded him that we agreed not to take each other to the airport.

Just don\u2019t take him if he won\u2019t return the favour", "NTA\n\nCan't figure out why it would even be a question. You're not a taxi service and the give and take isn't working for you. If he can pay for you to get to the airport, he can pay for himself. It's not your responsibility.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to agree with his point of view, and he might never agree with yours. He\u2019s still wrong, whether or not you convince him of it. You explained your reasoning, and that\u2019s the end of it.", "NTA\n\nhe is being a major AH.

Stick with your agreement.", "NTA, make sure to tell him Uber exists next time he asks you to drive him anywhere. What a jerk.", "NTA - He does not want to remember the multiple times you drove him to the airport; he simply wants others to do what benefits him. \n\nHis behavior is a ball of using others, lack of gratitude, not reciprocating favors and putting his need first with a coating of message spam broadcasts of how he was wronged. You are not the asshole but step away from this dynamic. Choose different rides to where you want to be it simply is not worth the hassle. You deserve easy reciprocated support but nothing he has done has been easy and his demeanor is not fun. Best to you.", "Tell your brother he's now an adult.  When adults make agreements - like to take someone to the airport - they honor their agreements.  When they agree to no longer take each other to the airport, they also honor their agreements.  It's not your fault he is too dumb to remember he needs you much more than you need him.  So tell him to put on his big boy pants and try to act his age instead of acting like a toddler.  Maybe next time he agrees to do something for someone, he won't act like a complete ass.  I doubt it, but anything is possible.  NTA", "I think you need a new roommate", "Honest question here, why not just drive to the airport and park? NTA regardless. If my husband has to fly out of town for work he parks his car at the airport, I do the same. If we are flying out together we park at the airport parking lot to avoid using Uber, cabs, and Super Shuttle. It can get pricey depending on the lots but I prefer to be at my own mercy for driving than someone doing me begrudging favors.", "IDK because I haven't figured out a similar situation for myself. I have no children and if I babysit when are my non existent kids getting watched in return. Im willing to help my siblings but sooner or later the thought does form, what's in it for me.

You can leave your car there while you travel. It can be pricey, but IMHO, if you can afford to fly several times a year, you can afford the parking expense.", "ESH - he sucks because that's a sucky thing of him to do. He should've given you the ride. You suck for doing favors to store up a bank of debt - favors should be done with no strings attached, otherwise, don't do them.", "So you and he agree not to take each other to airport anymore.\n\nThen he asks you to take him.\n\nThen you provide a whole bunch of reasons not to take him.

His actions have consequences. He's old enough to know that by now. If he can't get his shit together, his shit goes out the window. He can go home to mommy and finish his education there. You should not be inconvenienced the way you are right now.", "Sorta, my parents got tired of hearing me talk about it in New Orleans (they were there with me and my bf).

My mom calls me her oldest youngest child (I\u2019m 26, he\u2019s 28) which basically means that I\u2019m expected to take care of things when shit goes south. He\u2019s been acting a lot like our biological dad, who I don\u2019t talk to anymore, when it comes to the tantrums", "You need to stop subsidizing his life and stop taking care of him when shit hits the fan. He needs to learn to live for himself. He\u2019s already an adult toddler so there\u2019s no fixing that, but it\u2019s time for him to sink or swim.

I am guessing that you also do all or most of the chores at home? Time for him to grow up or send him back to mommy.  NTA.", "I\u2019ll give him the undergraduate part, a lot of stuff happened that lead to him not being able to do it when he was 18. But ya I do the chores because I learned that if I didn\u2019t my home would be a disgusting pit. He doesn\u2019t \u201cthink\u201d he makes dirty dishes therefor he won\u2019t do them. He also says he never uses the common spaces therefor it shouldn\u2019t be his responsibility to clean them.", "Um I think you should be telling him it's no longer his responsibility to live with you at all. Send him back to mummy"]}
