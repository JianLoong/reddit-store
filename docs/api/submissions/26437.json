On the occasions (and they do happen) that the school doesn't follow its own policies and punishes the pupil unfairly then that is the time to step in and fight against it.\n\nThis way the kids will learn to trust both you and the school as they will see they get punished when they should be but you will stand up for them when they shouldn't.\n\nParents that constantly fight against the school for every punishment are doing far more damage than good.  All they are teaching their kids is that they can do whatever they want at school and there are no consequences to their actions.", "NTA.

This is a reasonable dress code. 15 year olds push boundaries and want to take ownership of their bodies, which is great and normal, but they also have to learn that there are times when certain things are appropriate and when they're inappropriate. Being in a swimsuit cover up is fine if you're at a beach/pool/private event. Its not appropriate in school, at work (unless you work as a model or swimmer, etc), or in a weather inappropriate situation (ie it's winter and you're outside). The older sisters are defensive of little sister because they want to make sure she's got autonomy, but they're wrong here.

There are three options when dress-coded at our HS, wear some giant tee shirt the school gives you, get your parents to bring something else, be sent home.

For you and your younger daughter soft.\n\n\nYour younger daughter is young and (I mean this in the nicest way possible) ignorant. She's fucking up in a typical and perfectly healthy way for her age. So she's an ah technically but not much because even if she's wrong it's part of growing up and learning.\n\n\nYour older daughter and sister are huge AHs because instead of taking a more mature stance and helping calm the little one down they're egging her on in the wrong direction. They have no excuse, should know better.\n\n\nNow onto you, the controversial bit lol. I don't think you're *doing* anything wrong, I think you need to *do more*. Simply saying \"I agree with the school\" and watching your sister and other daughter rile her up is *not enough*.\n\n\nYou're her parent and it's your *job* to guide her and help her develope. You need to nudge her into the right path, simply stating your opinion and shrugging is *lacking*.\n\n\nMy advice on how to NOT be an AH at all and do the best in this situation:\n\n\n1) Calmly but firmly set boundries with your sister and older daughter, while they are entitled to their views and to share them freely adding more *emotions* into it is unacceptable. Tell them to please be respectful when sharing their pov.\n\n\n2) Sit your daughter down and have a heart to heart. Hear her out, don't interupt her, ask her about why she feels so strongly about this. LISTEN, and make her *feel listened to*, let her vent to you.\n\n\nThen, after validating her emotions, explain to her, from an experienced pov, how to regulate her emtions to fit public standards. The angle I would take isn't an \"oh it's inappropriate\" traditional sort of thing, because I think YOU think that's bs as well. Instead try \"It's about sharing a space where we all feel comfortable, and due to the type of people in a school being younger etc... [give your resons here] not showing your underwear is what achieves that.\"\n\n\n3) Finally, take her out for lunch where she can wear her outfit! Learning how to dress appropriately isn't only about restrictions, it's also about finding the places where you have those freedoms!\n\n\nThis is not only equally important, imo, but it's much likely she'll listen to you if she also gets to wear her outfit in an appropriate manner at some point.\n\n\nIn conclusion, ESH.

The shorts were the appropriate fingertip length in the front and back, but because the sides curved up slightly, it was deemed that she was dressed inappropriately with shorts that were too short.

Your job as a parent isn't to fight the school regardless of the merits, it is to look after your daughter's own best interests.

Except no one will call you to the principals office - you will just loose out on promotions or stop being invited to things or get red wine dumped on you in an 'accident'.  A parents job is to teach you what is appropriate to wear when.  And as someone who used to be a teenage girl - part of a parents job is to say 'hey, I know you *feel* fully grown up, but you are not actually all grown up and that outfit is not appropriate for an underage girl.  A lot of young girls go though the 'I'm gonna prove how grown up I am by dressing sexy' phase, and I am deeply deeply grateful to my parents for holding me back and to time for not having gotten around to smart phones and social media yet so there is no evidence out there on my more embarrassing moments.", "Exactly this.
