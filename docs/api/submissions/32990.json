For some back story, him and I met when I was a bartender. We didn't become close until after Cov19 happened. We ended up hanging out a lot when my job shut down and the whole country shut down. We did a bunch of drinking to pass time. Never a good thing to start a relationship off I know. \nI also have a daughter. She was staying with my parents for the school year in order to go to in school schooling. Our schools here all shut down and as a single mom trying to work full time and help her with online school at her age was a lot. We decided (as hard as it was for me) she should stay with my parents and go to her old school til the pandemic calmed down. ( we live states away )\nHe didn't meet my daughter until about a year of being together. Let me clear this up right at the beginning. I told him I had a daughter right off the bat. I also told him the drinking in my life wasn't normally this much and once my daughter was back things wouldn't be this way. Things calmed down and everything seems to be alright. The drinking wasn't out of control. We occasionally had drinks on weekends. Well I occasionally had drinks on weekends but he would sometimes drink weekdays( Nothing is wrong with that as long as you arnt overdoing it) \nTo catch you up to the present. I have not drank anything for almost 4 months now. I have been really working on myself and my health.My life is also my daughters life and I want that to be a great one for her. For almost a year now my BF has only gotten worse with his drinking. Coming home drunk, making a scene and doing it on weeknights. It's effecting mine and most importantly my daughters life. I have asked him, I have begged him to please stop drinking like he is. He swore he would but nothing has changed. It's only gotten worse. I have stuck by him and have tried to do everything I can do be there for him. It's effecting my personal life and work life now and he can't seem to go more then 2 weeks without coming home waisted. Would I be the ahole for leaving him and not staying to help him through this. My number one priority if my daughter.

Please don\u2019t wait until he kills someone in a drunk driving accident or starts abusing you and your daughter physically to decide you\u2019ve had enough.

I remember me and my siblings BEGGING them to stop drinking. They didn\u2019t stop for us. He wont stop for you. He needs to figure out why he drinks and solve those things within him.
